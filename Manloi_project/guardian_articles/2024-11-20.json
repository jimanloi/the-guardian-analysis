Marcus Fakana, from Tottenham, was on a family holiday in Dubai when he met the British girl, who is also from London and has since turned 18. He told the Detained in Dubai group: \u201cWe really liked each other but she was secretive with her family because they were strict. \u201cMy parents knew about our relationship but she couldn\u2019t tell hers. She had to meet me without telling them it was to see a boy.\u201d The pair had hoped to continue their relationship back in London after the girl returned home from her holiday. But Fakana said he was taken into custody without any explanation after police turned up at his family\u2019s hotel. He was detained for three days, Sky News reported, and was unable to contact his parents. Detained in Dubai, which campaigns to help people it says have suffered injustice in the UAE, said Fakana was charged because the girl\u2019s mother found their chats and pictures back in the UK. It is understood the woman subsequently contacted police in Dubai and Fakana was arrested. Campaigners say the teenager could face up to two decades in prison owing to the country\u2019s strict laws regarding sex outside marriage. \u201cDubai has only recently legalised out-of-wedlock sex for tourists but still hosts a strict Islamic legal system,\u201d said Radha Stirling, the chief executive of Detained in Dubai.

Scott, whose prominent billing comes with the description \u201cdesigns the desert\u201d, will reportedly design an immersive experience called CatcusCon, Rolling Stone reported, and will perform after Green Day\u2019s set on the Saturday nights. His appearance at Coachella comes five years after his aborted headline performance at the 2020 festival, which was cancelled due to Covid. He was then booked again for the 2022 festival, then removed from the lineup when 10 people died in a crowd crush at his Astroworld festival in 2021. This will be the second time Lady Gaga has headlined Coachella, having stepped in to replace Beyonc\u00e9 in 2017 when she postponed her performance due to her pregnancy. Post Malone has performed at Coachella multiple times before but has never headlined. In their 37-year career, Green Day has never performed at Coachella, though Billie Joe Armstrong joined the Replacements on stage in 2014. \u201cDeath, taxes, and rock\u2019n\u2019roll,\u201d Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong told Rolling Stone. \u201cIn this world gone sideways, we know one thing for certain: rock\u2019n\u2019roll is forever, and its spirit is needed now more than ever.

The evidence shows that life doesn\u2019t just feel hard \u2013 by many measures, it\u2019s a daily battle.</p> <h2>How do we measure wellbeing?</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Dr Kate Lycett. Photo supplied.</p></li> </ul> <p>The index, based on a representative survey of 2,000 Australians, focuses on personal and national wellbeing. For personal wellbeing, it examines satisfaction across seven life areas, including personal relationships, standard of living (finances) and achieving in life (sense of purpose). Over almost 25 years, Australian Unity and Deakin University have surveyed more than 78,000 Australians to track wellbeing over time.</p> <p>\u201cA good life can be measured in two ways,\u201d Lycett says. The first is objective wellbeing, which includes quantitative elements such as income, education, employment status and measurable health outcomes. The second is subjective: measures of how we feel about our lives, such as relationships, achievements and the ability to afford what we need. There are crossovers; for instance, we can have both objective and subjective perspectives on physical health.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t always line up,\u201d Lycett says. \u201cTwo people with the same household income can have very different perspectives in terms of how satisfied they feel about their lives, and they may have very different life circumstances, so objective measures may not tell us the full picture.\u201d</p> <p>For millennials, housing affordability, environmental crises, global unrest and the cost of living all appear to be contributors to this misunderstood generation\u2019s disappearing optimism.</p> <h2>Are millennials really in a wellbeing crisis?</h2> <p>Australians saw a big boost in wellbeing in 2020, at the start of the pandemic, a phenomenon Lycett attributes to economic and healthcare policy interventions. \u201cSatisfaction with the government and social conditions in Australia were at an all-time high during the early stages of Covid,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In the years since, our satisfaction with life in Australia has fallen steadily, and this year it has dropped to its lowest level since the index began. Our satisfaction with our personal lives remains really low, too. Lycett says the figures are particularly stark for younger populations.</p> <p>\u201cWe asked people whether they felt better or worse off financially, compared to their parents at the same age.\u201d The research found that about 47% of respondents aged between 18 and 54 felt worse off. Among Australians aged 55 years and older, only 22% felt worse off.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a huge divide,\u201d Lycett says. \u201cIt gets to the heart of the generational inequities that we\u2019re seeing. We know that young people are struggling financially but also on many fronts.\u201d</p> <p>Rates of mental distress, loneliness and material deprivation paint an especially grim picture: for example, Australians aged 18-34 reported notably higher feelings of mental distress and loneliness than people aged 55 and older. In addition, millennials were the least satisfied of any age group with their ability to afford the things they needed and to save money.</p> <p>\u201cThe [generational] wellbeing divide is huge.\u201d</p> <h2>What do millennials wish baby boomers understood?</h2>    <p>Lycett says the millennial stereotypes are unfair and unhelpful. \u201cI often talk about these data with people of the baby boomer generation,\u201d she says, \u201cand their comment is often, \u2018We had it hard too. Young people just need to get on with it.\u2019 The idea that young people are going to be OK \u2013 the data doesn\u2019t suggest so.\u201d</p> <p>Lycett says older generations often point out that millennials stand to inherit the most wealth in history. But, she says, this is less a reason to be optimistic than a sign of increasing inequity, as wealth is not shared evenly across older generations.</p> <p>\u201cMany people will be left behind,\u201d she says, which will also have an impact on wellbeing. \u201cWe saw that people of all ages who are renting or in other living arrangements have much lower levels of wellbeing compared to people who have been able to buy a house, even if they had a mortgage.\u201d</p> <p>Overall, millennials \u2013 one of the largest generations in history \u2013 face an uphill battle to even come close to their parents\u2019 financial stability, social engagement and happiness. Worse: they no longer expect to.</p> <p>\u201cThis comes to the heart of societal progress, which is the idea that each generation will be better off than the next,\u201d Lycett says. \u201cThis research is saying, young people don\u2019t feel they\u2019re going to be better off \u2013 and by many metrics, they\u2019re not.</p> <p>\u201cThat loss of hope is really sad.\u201d</p> <h2>How can generations start to close the gap?</h2>    <p>First, Lycett says, blaming one another isn\u2019t helpful \u2013 we need to connect one generation to another. Second, we need policies that focus on improving younger generations\u2019 opportunities and wellbeing.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the onus here is on older people to actually listen and try to understand young people, and not think, \u2018Toughen up, sunshine\u2019. We are living in a very different time with so much uncertainty. One only has to look at the time it takes to save for a housing deposit now to understand how different it is.</p> <p>\u201cFor boomers it used to take a few years to save for an average housing deposit; it\u2019s now estimated to take around 12-16 years.

Speaking to the Spanish parliament on Wednesday, she said actions, protocols, regulations and alerts were of little use \u201cif those who have to respond do not know how to do so\u201d.</p> <p>The regional president of Valencia, Carlos Maz\u00f3n, of the centre-right Popular party (PP), has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/15/valencias-president-carlos-mazon-admits-mistakes-in-flood-response-but-will-not-resign\">faced calls to resign</a> over his handling of the floods that killed 216 people in his region. His administration has been criticised for the hours-long delay in sending an alert to people\u2019s phones.</p> <p>Spain\u2019s sharply polarised politics arrived in Brussels last week when Maz\u00f3n\u2019s allies in the PP attacked Ribera during her hearing, seeking to blame her for the floods.</p> <p>She is in line to be von der Leyen\u2019s most powerful commissioner, responsible for the green transition and competition.</p> <p>The standoff meant all six vice-presidential nominees were held up. They were Kaja Kallas, who is also the EU\u2019s high representative for foreign policy; France\u2019s St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9, who will be in charge of industrial policy; Henna Virkkunen, intended to lead on technology policy; and Roxana M\u00eenzatu, given the job title of people, skills and preparedness. Hungary\u2019s nominee, Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi, was also blocked amid concerns about his country\u2019s democratic backsliding.</p> <p>If several candidates were rejected, von der Leyen would have had to seek new nominees from national governments, delaying her commission beyond 1 December, which is already a late start.</p> <p>Diplomats took an acid view of what they saw as a circular firing squad. It meant the EU was squabbling over internal processes rather than presenting a united front while facing a dire situation on the Ukrainian battlefields, with Donald Trump poised to return to the White House.</p> <p>The new commission is now expected to start work on 1 December, almost six months after European elections when voters returned more far-right MEPs than ever before in a vote that weakened governments in France and Germany.</p> <p>Under the agreement hashed out on Wednesday, the three groups have agreed that \u201cthe rule of law, a pro-Ukraine stance and a pro-European approach are core aspects of our cooperation\u201d.</p> <p>Agreement by party leaders does not guarantee every vote, so the commission will be looking for votes from Meloni\u2019s European Conservatives and Reformists, as well as the Greens.</p> <p>One French socialist MEP, Christophe Clergeau, said he condemned the \u201cvalidation of a far-right executive vice-president of the commission,\u201d referring to Fitto, as he announced he would vote against the commission.</p> <p>In her first 100 days, von der Leyen has promised a clean industry strategy to ensure good jobs as the EU prepares for net zero emissions by 2050, a white paper on European defence, and plans for agriculture, artificial intelligence and getting the bloc ready for enlargement.</p>",

      "bodyText": "European parliament leaders have reached a deal to approve Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s top team, paving the way for the new European Commission to take office on 1 December. Leaders of the centre-right European People\u2019s party (EPP), the Socialists and the centrist Renew group \u2013 who between them have 56% of the parliament\u2019s 720 seats \u2013 forged a compromise on Wednesday intended to ensure that von der Leyen\u2019s nominees would be approved in a vote next week. Von der Leyen has chosen 26 European commissioners to lead EU policies including the climate crisis, competitiveness, trade, industry, agriculture and nature, but the whole team has to be approved by MEPs in one vote, which is expected next Wednesday. Each commissioner faced a three-hour hearing in the parliament, but the approval process began to unravel when the Socialists threatened to block the appointment of Italy\u2019s vice-president nominee, Raffaele Fitto, a member of Giorgia Meloni\u2019s hardline Brothers of Italy party. The EPP in turn threatened to block the Spanish Socialist vice-president nominee, Teresa Ribera, who conservatives have attempted to blame for the catastrophic floods in Valencia. Ribera, who is a deputy prime minister of Spain as well as its environment and energy minister, said climate change was responsible for the deadly floods and Spain must improve officials\u2019 capacity to respond. Speaking to the Spanish parliament on Wednesday, she said actions, protocols, regulations and alerts were of little use \u201cif those who have to respond do not know how to do so\u201d. The regional president of Valencia, Carlos Maz\u00f3n, of the centre-right Popular party (PP), has faced calls to resign over his handling of the floods that killed 216 people in his region. His administration has been criticised for the hours-long delay in sending an alert to people\u2019s phones. Spain\u2019s sharply polarised politics arrived in Brussels last week when Maz\u00f3n\u2019s allies in the PP attacked Ribera during her hearing, seeking to blame her for the floods. She is in line to be von der Leyen\u2019s most powerful commissioner, responsible for the green transition and competition. The standoff meant all six vice-presidential nominees were held up. They were Kaja Kallas, who is also the EU\u2019s high representative for foreign policy; France\u2019s St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9, who will be in charge of industrial policy; Henna Virkkunen, intended to lead on technology policy; and Roxana M\u00eenzatu, given the job title of people, skills and preparedness. Hungary\u2019s nominee, Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi, was also blocked amid concerns about his country\u2019s democratic backsliding. If several candidates were rejected, von der Leyen would have had to seek new nominees from national governments, delaying her commission beyond 1 December, which is already a late start. Diplomats took an acid view of what they saw as a circular firing squad. It meant the EU was squabbling over internal processes rather than presenting a united front while facing a dire situation on the Ukrainian battlefields, with Donald Trump poised to return to the White House. The new commission is now expected to start work on 1 December, almost six months after European elections when voters returned more far-right MEPs than ever before in a vote that weakened governments in France and Germany. Under the agreement hashed out on Wednesday, the three groups have agreed that \u201cthe rule of law, a pro-Ukraine stance and a pro-European approach are core aspects of our cooperation\u201d. Agreement by party leaders does not guarantee every vote, so the commission will be looking for votes from Meloni\u2019s European Conservatives and Reformists, as well as the Greens. One French socialist MEP, Christophe Clergeau, said he condemned the \u201cvalidation of a far-right executive vice-president of the commission,\u201d referring to Fitto, as he announced he would vote against the commission. In her first 100 days, von der Leyen has promised a clean industry strategy to ensure good jobs as the EU prepares for net zero emissions by 2050, a white paper on European defence, and plans for agriculture, artificial intelligence and getting the bloc ready for enlargement.",

      "bodyText": "Thank you for joining me for this match. It was a clinical performance from Chelsea who scored through Bronze, Kaptein and Perisset. To recap all the action have a read of the report below. I will be back tomorrow to bring you all the updates from Arsenal v Juventus, see you then. Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor said of Lola Brown\u2019s debut: \u201cIt is a special week for her. She has been practising with us &amp; I can see her talent, even if she is young. She is really dynamic, smart &amp; good with the ball. She will progress. This will bring her a lot of joy and confidence.\u201d Lyon\u2019s result mean they also progress to the last eight of the Champions League. In the other 8pm GMT kick-off Lyon beat Roma 4-1 including two goals from Kadidiatou Diani. The win is Chelsea\u2019s 11th victory from 11 games this season. Chelsea didn\u2019t seem like they could get better than they have been over the past few seasons but they have somehow found another gear. Eve Perisset\u2019s penalty was her first ever Chelsea goal and also her first Champions League goal in her career. Chelsea are through to the Champions League quarter-finals with two group games to spare with an impressive 3-0 win over Celtic. It also means the Scottish side will not progress to the knockout rounds in their first Champions League season. But they can take positives from this performance, their defence in the second half has been impressive, aside from that last-minute penalty. Bronze shocked them early on and Kaptein and Perisset added more to secure the win in the first half. Easily slotted. 90 + 3 min: McGregor has a handball in the box and Chelsea have a penalty. 90 + 2 min: Noonan, who has been a bright spark for Celtic since coming on, lays it up for McGregor whose shot is saved by Musovic. 90 + 1 min: There will be four minutes added. 90 min: Chelsea running down the clock here as they look to secure their spot in the quarter-finals with two games to spare. 88 min: Chelsea win a free kick and Perisset takes it. It\u2019s dealt with well initially but Chelsea keep the move alive but Celtic push them back to Musovic. 86 min: Brown is just 17-years-old and signed her first professional deal recently. Not a bad game to enter and what a stage to do it on too. 85 min: Ramirez really is feeling comfortable who makes a storming run towards goal but Hayes does well again to block. Celtic counter with McGregor crossing it in but Musovic is there. Chelsea make two changes with Lawrence and Nusken for Brown and Bartel. 84 min: Ramirez is back on and looking comfortable which will be a relief for Chelsea fans, the club currently have four players out with ACL injuries. 83 min: It seems to be an issue with her knee and everyone will be hoping it is not the dreaded ACL. She is back to her feet and she slowly walks to the sideline. I think she is okay to continue though she hasn\u2019t re-entered play just yet. 81 min: Ramirez stretches to try and score, the ball goes beyond the goal but she stays down. This is a worrying sign. 81 min: I don\u2019t think they announce player of the match on the stream so I will hunt for it post-match for you. I will be surprised if it isn\u2019t given to Bronze, she has been everywhere for Chelsea tonight. 79 min: A journalist at the game has spotted Sonia Bompastor not wearing socks in this freezing cold weather. She built differently. As is her team with Bronze peeling away into the box but Celtic do well to block her. 77 min: McGregor has a good run but Jean-Francios tracks her all the way and dispossesses her. 75 min: I\u2019m running out of ways to describe Chelsea attack but they are on the frontfoot again. Bronze, who is having a belter of a game, crosses to find Ramirez but she fouls again so Celtic clear. 73 min: Hayes pops in a long ball with Gallacher making a run into the box but Musovic reads it well and it bounces into her hands. 71 min: Can anyone stop Chelsea this season? After performances like this one, and the one against Man City, they seem unstoppable. But come games against the likes of Bayern Munich or Barcelona and that may turn the tide. Chelsea make a change with Perisset on for Reiten and Celtic make a sub with Smith off for Noonan. 69 min: Three guesses what Chelsea have won? No, okay I\u2019ll tell you. It\u2019s another corner. Reiten is over the ball and sends it in and it comes to Bright but her shot is blocked. Celtic really well drilled defensively on that set piece now. 68 min: A long ball finds Ramirez. who barges into Clark in the box and is seen as a foul so Celtic kick clear. 66 min: Chelsea win a free kick now but it\u2019s in their own half and so Bronze passes backwards as they set up their latest attack. 64 min: The set piece is taken from a great position and the delivery is a good one, Reiten gets to it first but it isn\u2019t a clean clearance and Cuthbert needs to mop up the afters. 63 min: There may only be a few hundred travelling Celtic fans but they are really making themselves known at Stamford Bridge, building the atmosphere nicely. Celtic win a free kick through Lawton after a foul from Lawrence. 62 min: Celtic make changes with Agnew off for Cross and Cavanagh is off for S Carstens. 61 min: Chelsea take this one short and it takes a while for it to come in but Bronze crosses and Kaptein gets a head to it but Daugherty saves. Chelsea\u2019s short corners have been the more effective tonight, they were used before both goals were scored. 60 min: Bronze takes the corner but it\u2019s a poor delivery and it\u2019s headed away. A few passes later though and Chelsea trudge back to the corner flag for yet another set piece. Reiten the one over this and it\u2019s whipped in but headed clear and out for, yes you guessed it, another corner. 58 min: Chelsea win yet another corner, they have had so many this evening. Before they take it Chelsea make a change with Kaneryd off for Cuthbert. 58 min: Bronze is the taker and it\u2019s a good delivery but Daugherty punches clear, it is then deflected out for another corner. The England international takes it again but again Celtic see it out. It\u2019s on the other side this time so Reiten is the taker. It comes in but Celtic defend it well. 56 min: Celtic look so promising at moments in this match but a poor touch or pass are letting them down. Ashworth-Clifford put in a great cross but it can\u2019t be controlled and Chelsea win it back. They run it through the team and Ramirez has fine work to get a shot away but what an amazing block from Hayes, who concedes a corner. 54 min: W has emailed and said: Is not having any added time common in the women\u2019s game? I can\u2019t recall the last time that happened in the men\u2019s unless everyone involved was in a hurry to get back home. It\u2019s not common, no. The first half was just well paced with no injuries. Chelsea are still peppering shots at Celtic goal with Reiten and Mpome coming close but they just can\u2019t convert right now. 52 min: A lovely Chelsea team move sees Ramirez with the ball at her feet but she is well marshalled away from goal. Chelsea come again and Kaptein has a long range shot but it\u2019s just over the bar. 50 min: Nusken manages to keep a ball in play through a gut-busting run but then she is dispossessed. Possession exchanges hands but Chelsea end up with it and they start some patient build-up play. 48 min: Agnew wins a free kick after a challenge from Lawrence, it\u2019s right on halfway. Clark takes it long but Barclais hits it out and the chance is gone. 47 min: Celtic must be the first to score in this half if they have a hope of getting back into this one. But it\u2019s eerily similar to the start of the first with an early Chelsea corner. Reiten\u2019s delivery isn\u2019t the best and Celtic can clear. So can Celtic stage a famous comeback? Or will Chelsea run away with it? All to come. chelsea have made a change with Macario off for Ramirez. Bronze\u2019s goal was her first Champions League goal for Chelsea. That means she has now scored for four different clubs in the competition. Bronze scored just after the minute mark to give Chelsea a perfect start and Kaptein added another. If the score stays like this Chelsea will progress to the quarters with two games to spare. A lot of work for Celtic to do. No added time and we\u2019re at the break. 45 min: Mpome sends in a great ball but Celtic read it well to clear but blue shirt immediately descend on the ball, Celtic do not have a moment to breather right now. Wave after wave of Chelsea attack. 43 min: A reminder that you can get in touch and share your thoughts with me via email. 41 min: What a ball from Agnew which finds Ashworth-Clifford but she is suddenly surrounded by Chelsea defenders and she is muscled off of the ball. 40 min: A poor pass at the back from Chelsea sees Agnew pounce but her cross is cleared. Chelsea counter and Kaneryd makes a phenomenal run to spark the chance to life, it is cleared though to extinguish a hope of a goal for now. 38 min: Macario takes it and Mpome gets to it but Celtic swarm her to put her off and it goes over the bar. 37 min: Chelsea are getting closer to a third with it pinballing around in the box but Celtic manager to boot it clear. They come again with Lawrence sending it in but Hayes sees it out for another corner. 36 min: Nusken takes a long range effort and has space to direct it on target but it is just over the bar. That would have been a belter if it went in. 34 min: For me the difference for Celtic last week was McGregor and she has been so quiet this evening with Chelsea absolutely running riot. Celtic haven\u2019t had a shot on target yet. 32 min: Chelsea want a third and Reiten is fed the ball but she rockets it over the bar. 30 min: Lawrence wins a corner and Macario is the taker this time. It reaches Kaptein but Celtic do enough to see it out for another corner. They take it shot but it\u2019s cleared again. 29 min: Celtic win a free kick from inside their own half and so they will have to build from deep here. They lose out after three passes and Chelsea are on the hunt once more. 27 min: You have to say that might be lights out for Celtic\u2019s Champions League campaign, they need to beat Chelsea tonight to keep those hopes alive but scoring three goals and stopping Chelsea from scoring anymore does not look likely. A set piece goal once again. It\u2019s taken short by Reiten and it comes back to her, she sends it in and Kaptein finishes off a header. It was coming. 24 min: Mpome is having a great game at the back who is expertly covering the counterattack chances Celtic are creating. 22 min: Some intricate play sees Bronze cross it in but Celtic clear, it is an utter barrage from the Blues so far. Celtic have had glimpses of chances but Sonia Bompastor\u2019s team are in full control here. 20 min: Hayes does well to shepherd out an overhit ball from Reiten for a goal kick. They then set themselves off on a good run through Agnew but she takes a long range effort which is well wide. 18 min: Chelsea move the ball right and left but they can\u2019t find a way through the Celtic defence at the moment. 16 min: A peach of a ball sets Kaneryd off, she crosses in but Celtic manage to get their first to clear it. The Sweden international is a threat every time she is on the ball. 14 min: Celtic are building here but they just need to stop rushing their attack play when they do have some frontfoot ball. That is partly down to Chelsea\u2019s high press but they also seem slightly panicked after conceding early. Some patience and more time on the ball and they could get themselves back into it. 12 min: Celtic with their first bit of sustained possession and Cavanagh crosses in after a strong challenge but Bronze it there to clear. 10 min: Reiten sends a great ball into the area but Kaneryd can\u2019t get their, it is deflected out for another corner though. Celtic will need to be much tighter to their opposition this time and it is well defended. The earlier corner Bronze was able to run riot but it seems Celtic have put that right now. 8 min: This could turn into a blood bath if Celtic do not stem Chelsea\u2019s momentum soon. The Blues are in the area again thanks to a great run from Macario, the US international takes a punt but it\u2019s just over the bar. 6 min: Celtic have not had a whiff of the ball so far, it\u2019s been completely dominant from Chelsea. A stark change from their game against Celtic last week where the Scottish side scored first. Kaneryd takes a long range shot but Daugherty saves. 4 min: Well this match started with a bang. An uphill battle for Celtic now who need to win at Stamford Bridge if they are to progress. What a goal from Bronze. Reiten took the corner short but it got popped in and Bronze belted it in on her right foot. Huge. From an early corner. Here we go. I believe Celtic need a win tonight or their hopes of progressing will be over. The players are out at Stamford Bridge shortly. Can Chelsea keep their winning run going? Or can Celtic record their first Women\u2019s Champions League win? A reminder if Chelsea pick up a point or more they will secure their knockout stage place. Have a read of our weekly women\u2019s football newsletter, it\u2019s focused on Marta this week: An lovely bit of news has dropped in the last hour too, 80,000 tickets have been sold for England v USA on 30 November. A huge crowd for a great encounter. I saw people making winter puns with player names and I\u2019d love for you to share yours with me. The best I have come up with is Sam Brrrr, so as you can see I need some help. Send me yours via email. Here\u2019s what happened last week between the two clubs: Celtic manager Elena Sadiku said: \u201cI think also we\u2019ve been growing into the competition, so how we played against Chelsea last time obviously encourages us to grow even more. I think we\u2019ve been defending really well in all of the games. What the players have learned the most is about being more brave and confident, especially in possession.\u201d Here\u2019s what Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor said pre-game: \u201cWe work really hard as a team and a club to succeed. Maybe people think that\u2019s easy but it\u2019s not - it\u2019s a lot of hard work. I\u2019m lucky because I have a good squad with a lot of talent. I have depth in my squad. We have had good results but we need to keep our heads on our shoulders.\u201d If any Chelsea fans are wondering where Aggie Beever-Jones is, she is suspended after receiving a red card last week. The team news is in! Sonia Bompastor has Zecira Musovic in goal with Hannah Hampton on the bench. Chelsea: Musovic, Bright, Nusken, Macario, Reiten, Lawrence, Kaptein, Rytting Kaneryd, Bronze, Mpome, Jean-Francois Subs: Hampton, Cox, Ramirez, Cuthbert, Bjorn, Perisset, Bartel, Baltimore, Hamano, Brown Celtic, meanwhile, start bright stars Lucy Ashworth-Clifford and Murphy Agnew. Celtic: Daugherty, Barclais, Gallacher, Smith, Cavanagh, Agnew, McGregor, Clark, Hayes, Ashworth-Clifford, Lawton Subs: Logan, Rodgers, S Carstens, M Carstens, Kerner, Cross, Noonan, Bruna Costa, Munoz, McAney Hello and welcome to our Women\u2019s Champions League coverage where tonight we will be focusing on Chelsea v Celtic. The two clubs played one another last week where the Blues came out 2-1 winners but Celtic challenged Chelsea well and they could come out on top this evening. They especially exploited Chelsea on the counter and I expect them to use the same tactic this evening. The Blues have continued their winning streak with an impressive win over Manchester City last weekend, while Celtic narrowly lost 3-2 to rivals Rangers. We will see what the managers have said in the build up to this one shortly but first let\u2019s take a look at the team news.",

      "body": "<p>Grenfell, the Post Office, infected blood, Hillsborough \u2026 Britain has witnessed a long series of injustices where walls of silence and lies have stopped the powerless inconveniencing the powerful by telling their whole truths. To that list, in the section where further disclosure is still urgently required, we should add the UK\u2019s nuclear testing scandal. This calmly scathing documentary sets out the case.</p> <p>Post-second world war, the US and the USSR engaged in a nuclear arms race, and Britain \u2013 desperate to cling to its place at the world\u2019s top table \u2013 felt obliged to join them. As it tried to keep up with developments in atomic and hydrogen bombs, nuclear tests were desired, but letting off nukes anywhere near regular British citizens was politically unviable, so distant lands were sought and human guinea pigs identified.</p> <p>The locations chosen were Pacific atolls and the Australian outback and coast; the unwitting human test subjects were, as well as the local people, around 39,000 British and Commonwealth servicemen and scientists. Between 1952 and 1963, they witnessed 45 atomic and hydrogen bombs being detonated, along with hundreds of other radioactive experiments.

      "bodyText": "Grenfell, the Post Office, infected blood, Hillsborough \u2026 Britain has witnessed a long series of injustices where walls of silence and lies have stopped the powerless inconveniencing the powerful by telling their whole truths. To that list, in the section where further disclosure is still urgently required, we should add the UK\u2019s nuclear testing scandal. This calmly scathing documentary sets out the case. Post-second world war, the US and the USSR engaged in a nuclear arms race, and Britain \u2013 desperate to cling to its place at the world\u2019s top table \u2013 felt obliged to join them. As it tried to keep up with developments in atomic and hydrogen bombs, nuclear tests were desired, but letting off nukes anywhere near regular British citizens was politically unviable, so distant lands were sought and human guinea pigs identified. The locations chosen were Pacific atolls and the Australian outback and coast; the unwitting human test subjects were, as well as the local people, around 39,000 British and Commonwealth servicemen and scientists. Between 1952 and 1963, they witnessed 45 atomic and hydrogen bombs being detonated, along with hundreds of other radioactive experiments. Many of those affected, who had been stationed at the blast sites so the effects on humans could be monitored, are interviewed in this film. Leading the talking heads are British veterans who, as young men in the 1950s and 60s, were offered the chance to sail halfway around the world to serve their country. Initially, when they arrived at, say, Christmas Island or the Monte Bello archipelago off the coast of north-western Australia, they were in paradise, living a life of sunshine, beer, seafood and beach football with, as one says, \u201cno idea what we were letting ourselves in for\u201d.

Almost more upsetting are the tales of what came next, particularly among the men\u2019s offspring. Children were born with disabilities and disfigurements; grandchildren show signs of genetic defects.

      "body": "<p>Having adapted Elena Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan novels over three superlative series so far, My Brilliant Friend comes to a conclusion with its take on the fourth and final book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/03/the-story-of-the-lost-child-elena-ferrante-review-finale\">The Story of the Lost Child</a>. Like its outstanding previous seasons, this Italian drama continues to be rich, sumptuous and deliciously overwrought, but at the same time thoughtful and surprisingly delicate. This beautiful take on Ferrante\u2019s work has done nothing but impress since the very beginning, and it goes out on a high.</p> <p>For the first time since season one, Len\u00f9 and Lila have been recast, with Alba Rohrwacher replacing Margherita Mazzucco and Irene Maiorino taking over from Gaia Girace. We rejoin Len\u00f9 in the late 1970s, when her writing career has truly taken off. As she travels Europe to give readings and speeches, her affair with Nino Sarratore (now played by Fabrizio Gifuni) is all-consuming, to the extent that she wonders if she loves him more than she loves her own daughters. The question of whether she loves him (or anyone) more than her work, however, remains an unspoken one, though it is at the heart of this tale.</p> <p>Italy is in a state of violent political upheaval and reform, shown in montages of archive footage, but also in the changing natures of the people in this story. This sense of a tectonic shift, historical and later very literal, is mirrored in Len\u00f9\u2019s life, as she leaves Pietro and his family in Florence and drags Dede and Elsa around the country, trying to find a safe port in the storm of her tumultuous romance. After catastrophic rows with her own mother and Pietro\u2019s mother Adele \u2013 and what a clash that one is \u2013 there is no surprise about where she eventually comes to rest.</p>    <p>In this season, there is a lot more of Nino, which is frustrating at times: the man is a liar and a manipulative hypocrite, and it takes a long time for him to fall from grace in the eyes of Len\u00f9, no matter what he puts her through. This frustration is compounded by the fact that in the early episodes, there is a lot less of Lila: this is Len\u00f9\u2019s perspective, after all, and she is avoiding her friend from the old neighbourhood in Naples, ignoring years of messages and phone calls, until she can no longer keep away. When Lila does return to the main story, it is long overdue, and her acidic charisma is a firework on the screen. The friction of their friendship, destined to repeat its destructive pattern of push and pull, is one of the most intricate and complex relationships I have seen depicted on screen.</p> <p>Each episode of My Brilliant Friend feels like a film in miniature. It takes a confident, artistic approach to depicting the passage of time, unfurling like a languid animal. Sometimes, one decision will be considered for a whole hour, and then perhaps it will be acted upon, or perhaps not. Days pass slowly, but whole years pass in a flash. It is an exercise in delayed gratification \u2013 Len\u00f9 does not return to Naples for six years \u2013 but it is so compelling that you don\u2019t want to miss a moment, even if that moment does involve Len\u00f9 inexplicably pining over Nino yet again. Much of the action, if you can call it that, is incited by telephone calls, from borrowed moments on someone else\u2019s landline right through to the final few minutes of the whole thing: that ringing iPhone as Lila\u2019s son calls Len\u00f9 to ask if she has seen his missing mother. At times this brings a narrow, stagey, theatrical feel to it, which perfectly complements the expanse of social change and the passing decades.</p> <p>To take a story from the 1970s through to the 00s in just 10 episodes, and to do so convincingly, requires a special effort. Happily, this is one of the finer dramas of the past few years. It comes to an end circling back to where it began, with an older Len\u00f9 wondering where her friend has gone. It is startling to realise how little has been resolved, how many threads have been left to hang in the breeze. But, to loosely paraphrase Lila, who makes a similar point towards the end of this stunning saga, to tie things up neatly would be the stuff of bad novels. This is not taken from a bad novel, but even so, plenty of good novels have been made into bad TV series. This is a testament to its source material, but also a gorgeous wonder of its very own.</p> <p>\u2022 My Brilliant Friend aired on Sky Atlantic and is on Now in the UK, and on SBS and SBS On Demand in Australia</p>",

      "bodyText": "Having adapted Elena Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan novels over three superlative series so far, My Brilliant Friend comes to a conclusion with its take on the fourth and final book, The Story of the Lost Child. Like its outstanding previous seasons, this Italian drama continues to be rich, sumptuous and deliciously overwrought, but at the same time thoughtful and surprisingly delicate. This beautiful take on Ferrante\u2019s work has done nothing but impress since the very beginning, and it goes out on a high. For the first time since season one, Len\u00f9 and Lila have been recast, with Alba Rohrwacher replacing Margherita Mazzucco and Irene Maiorino taking over from Gaia Girace. We rejoin Len\u00f9 in the late 1970s, when her writing career has truly taken off. As she travels Europe to give readings and speeches, her affair with Nino Sarratore (now played by Fabrizio Gifuni) is all-consuming, to the extent that she wonders if she loves him more than she loves her own daughters. The question of whether she loves him (or anyone) more than her work, however, remains an unspoken one, though it is at the heart of this tale. Italy is in a state of violent political upheaval and reform, shown in montages of archive footage, but also in the changing natures of the people in this story. This sense of a tectonic shift, historical and later very literal, is mirrored in Len\u00f9\u2019s life, as she leaves Pietro and his family in Florence and drags Dede and Elsa around the country, trying to find a safe port in the storm of her tumultuous romance. After catastrophic rows with her own mother and Pietro\u2019s mother Adele \u2013 and what a clash that one is \u2013 there is no surprise about where she eventually comes to rest. In this season, there is a lot more of Nino, which is frustrating at times: the man is a liar and a manipulative hypocrite, and it takes a long time for him to fall from grace in the eyes of Len\u00f9, no matter what he puts her through. This frustration is compounded by the fact that in the early episodes, there is a lot less of Lila: this is Len\u00f9\u2019s perspective, after all, and she is avoiding her friend from the old neighbourhood in Naples, ignoring years of messages and phone calls, until she can no longer keep away. When Lila does return to the main story, it is long overdue, and her acidic charisma is a firework on the screen. The friction of their friendship, destined to repeat its destructive pattern of push and pull, is one of the most intricate and complex relationships I have seen depicted on screen. Each episode of My Brilliant Friend feels like a film in miniature. It takes a confident, artistic approach to depicting the passage of time, unfurling like a languid animal. Sometimes, one decision will be considered for a whole hour, and then perhaps it will be acted upon, or perhaps not. Days pass slowly, but whole years pass in a flash. It is an exercise in delayed gratification \u2013 Len\u00f9 does not return to Naples for six years \u2013 but it is so compelling that you don\u2019t want to miss a moment, even if that moment does involve Len\u00f9 inexplicably pining over Nino yet again. Much of the action, if you can call it that, is incited by telephone calls, from borrowed moments on someone else\u2019s landline right through to the final few minutes of the whole thing: that ringing iPhone as Lila\u2019s son calls Len\u00f9 to ask if she has seen his missing mother. At times this brings a narrow, stagey, theatrical feel to it, which perfectly complements the expanse of social change and the passing decades. To take a story from the 1970s through to the 00s in just 10 episodes, and to do so convincingly, requires a special effort. Happily, this is one of the finer dramas of the past few years. It comes to an end circling back to where it began, with an older Len\u00f9 wondering where her friend has gone. It is startling to realise how little has been resolved, how many threads have been left to hang in the breeze. But, to loosely paraphrase Lila, who makes a similar point towards the end of this stunning saga, to tie things up neatly would be the stuff of bad novels. This is not taken from a bad novel, but even so, plenty of good novels have been made into bad TV series. This is a testament to its source material, but also a gorgeous wonder of its very own. \u2022 My Brilliant Friend aired on Sky Atlantic and is on Now in the UK, and on SBS and SBS On Demand in Australia",

We watch Penny\u2019s relationships with her friends and family twist and founder (there is an extraordinarily painful scene at a funeral in which Grace gives a eulogy that stands as a monument not to the departed but to the devastating cruelty of which children are capable). We see her domestic and professional life implode \u2013 all while the more mundane traumas continue unabated; knackered freezers, ruined lasagnes, broken bike chains, rats in the compost heap. The small stuff doesn\u2019t stop just because a large, terrible thing has arrived. It\u2019s the same textured layering of middle-aged life that Mare and Happy Valley attended to so closely, and gives it the same immersive quality \u2013 absolute authenticity through and through. Directed by Peter Salmon and written mostly by Dianne Taylor (Sam Shore, Martha Hardy-Ward and Emily Perkins round out the team), After the Party is brilliantly executed and the supporting characters are uniformly well-rounded and immaculately played. But Malcolm is the centrepiece. What a role. What an actor. What a performance. \u2022 After the Party is on Channel 4 in the UK now and can be streamed on ABC iview in Australia.",

In addition to the landmines \u2013 which aid groups have widely criticized due to their impact on civilians \u2013 the latest $275m US aid package includes drones, Himars ammunitions and artillery. Various aid groups have expressed criticisms to Agence France-Presse over the US\u2019s decision to send landmines to Ukraine, the outlet reports. Alma Taslid\u017ean of Handicap International said that they \u201ccannot distinguish between combatants and civilians\u201d while Tamar Gabelnick, head of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, called the US\u2019s decision \u201cunconscionable\u201d. Four Latin American countries have issued a joint statement in which they called to \u201cavoid actions that would escalate the arms race\u201d in the Ukraine-Russia war, Agence France-Presse reports. The four countries \u2013 Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico \u2013 said that such actions would \u201caggravate the conflict\u201d. Ukraine has fired UK-made Storm Shadow missiles into Russia for the first time since the beginning of the conflict, the Guardian understands according to multiple sources. The decision to approve the strikes was made in response to the deployment of more than 10,000 North Korean troops on Russia\u2019s border with Ukraine in what UK and US officials have warned was a major escalation of the nearly three-year-old conflict. US and Ukrainian officials have confirmed Kyiv employed US-made Atacms missiles to strike targets within Russia. The Kremlin stated that six missiles were launched at the town of Karachev, with fragments from one reportedly causing a significant explosion. Sergey Naryshkin, the director of Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service, was quoted in Russian media on Wednesday as saying that attempts by Nato countries to strike inside Russia would not go \u201cunpunished\u201d. Elsewhere, the chief of staff in Belarus, Pavel Muraveiko, described US moves to allow Ukraine to deploy longer-range missiles and anti-personnel mines as \u201cirresponsible\u201d. Staff at the Irish embassy in Ukraine have been told to work from home as tensions continue to escalate in the region. It follows from the US shutting its own embassy in Kyiv because of a \u201cpotential significant air attack\u201d by Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s forces. Italy, Spain and Greece also closed their embassies in Kyiv today, according to Suspilne, Ukraine\u2019s state broadcaster. In the early afternoon, the Ukrainian air force told people to seek shelter because of a missile threat. Senior officials told people not to ignore the alert. That came shortly before Kyiv\u2019s top military spy agency GUR issued a warning about a Russian psychological operation it said involved fake messages claiming to have been sent by the agency. Russia\u2019s defence ministry has claimed that Ukraine lost 400 service personnel on the Kursk front in the last 24 hours. The ministry gave a detailed list of western-supplied Ukrainian equipment it had destroyed. The claims have not been independently verified. Amnesty International has condemned the US decision to send anti-personnel landmines to Ukraine as part of the latest aid package, calling it \u201creckless\u201d and a \u201csetback\u201d in the fight against the use of landmines. In a statement, Amnesty spokesperson Ben Linden said: \u201cIt is devastating, and frankly shocking, that President Biden made such a consequential and dangerous decision just before his public service legacy is sealed for the history books.\u201d Linden urged Biden to reconsider the decision, adding: \u201cAnti-personnel landmines are inherently indiscriminate weapons that maim and kill civilians long after conflicts end and shouldn\u2019t have a place in the arsenal of any country. Even the \u2018non-persistent\u2019 mines are a threat to civilians.\u201d The US is not a signatory to the 1997 Mine Ban treaty but has not exported anti-personnel mines since 1992. How might Russia respond to the UK and US letting Ukraine hit it with their missiles? The Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger reports: The Kremlin has brandished its strategic arsenal before over the course of the Ukrainian conflict, in an attempt to deter western involvement. But for all the threats, the US has said it has seen no signs of unusual movement at Russian nuclear weapon storage sites, suggesting there has been no change in the physical positioning of tactical warheads. Most experts think use of nuclear weapons by Russia is unlikely for now, but have cautioned against complacency. Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research, said he did not believe that dropping a bomb in Ukraine was on Moscow\u2019s list of options \u201cprimarily because it would not help achieve any military goals, and Russia is advancing at the moment\u201d. Read the full explainer here: Four Latin American countries have issued a joint statement in which they called to \u201cavoid actions that would escalate the arms race\u201d in the Ukraine-Russia war, Agence France-Presse reports. The four countries \u2013 Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico \u2013 said that such actions would \u201caggravate the conflict\u201d. The joint statement comes after Ukraine fired long-range, UK-made missiles into Russia for the first time since the war began in February 2022, prompting Russia to vow a response. In a video address on Wednesday, Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the US and Joe Biden for the provision of landmines to Ukrainian troops, calling it \u201cessential \u2026 to stop Russian assaults\u201d. In addition to the landmines \u2013 which aid groups have widely criticized due to their impact on civilians \u2013 the latest $275m US aid package includes drones, Himars ammunitions and artillery. \u201cThis marks the 70th defense package from the United States. Ukraine deeply values the bipartisan support from America and the decision of president Biden,\u201d the Ukrainian president said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed the US\u2019s decision to provide Ukraine with landmines, Agence France-Presse reports. Calling the weapons \u2013 which have been condemned by international aid groups \u2013 \u201cvery important to stop Russian assaults\u201d, the Ukrainian president said they would \u201creally strengthen our troops on the front\u201d. Describing the landmines, the US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said on Wednesday that they \u201cwould self-activate, self-detonate and that makes it ... far more safer eventually than the things that they are creating on their own\u201d. Various aid groups have expressed criticisms to Agence France-Presse over the US\u2019s decision to send landmines to Ukraine, the outlet reports. Speaking of the anti-personnel landmines, Alma Taslid\u017ean of Handicap International said that they \u201ccannot distinguish between combatants and civilians\u201d. Taslid\u017ean added to AFP: \u201cIn that sense, it\u2019s unethical to use landmines.\u201d Similarly, Mary Wareham, advocacy director of the arms division at the Human Rights Watch, told the AFP: \u201cIt\u2019s just astonishing that the White House now appears to be walking back its own policy to transfer to Ukraine, which is a member of the treaty banning anti-personnel landmines.\u201d Meanwhile, Tamar Gabelnick, head of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, called the US\u2019s decision \u201cunconscionable\u201d and said it \u201crepresents a dangerous setback in the global fight against landmines\u201d. Here are some images coming through the newswires in recent days from Ukraine: It is approaching 8pm in Kyiv and 9pm in Moscow. Here are the key developments so far today: Ukraine has fired UK-made Storm Shadow missiles into Russia for the first time since the beginning of the conflict, the Guardian understands according to multiple sources. The decision to approve the strikes was made in response to the deployment of more than 10,000 North Korean troops on Russia\u2019s border with Ukraine in what UK and US officials have warned was a major escalation of the nearly three-year-old conflict. The spokesperson for UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said his office would not be commenting on reports or operational matters. The Biden administration will allow Ukraine to use US-supplied antipersonnel landmines to help it slow Russia\u2019s battlefield progress in the war, the US defence secretary said on Wednesday, marking Washington\u2019s second major policy shift in days after it decided to let Ukraine strike targets on Russian soil with longer-range US-made missiles. US and Ukrainian officials have confirmed Kyiv employed US-made Atacms missiles to strike targets within Russia. The Kremlin stated that six missiles were launched at the town of Karachev, with fragments from one reportedly causing a significant explosion. In response, Russia has announced it is adjusting its nuclear doctrine. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow would interpret any attack against it carried out by a non-nuclear state using weapons supplied by a nuclear state as a joint assault. Peskov also reiterated that a \u201cfreeze\u201d of the conflict in Ukraine along the existing frontlines would be unacceptable to the Russian Federation. During his daily press briefing, Peskov declined to comment when asked about the US embassy closing in Kyiv, but said that Russia believed the outgoing Joe Biden administration had shown that it is fully committed to continuing the war in Ukraine and is doing everything possible to achieve that. Sergey Naryshkin, the director of Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service, was quoted in Russian media on Wednesday as saying that attempts by Nato countries to strike inside Russia would not go \u201cunpunished\u201d.

Italy, Spain and Greece also closed their embassies in Kyiv today, according to Suspilne, Ukraine\u2019s state broadcaster. The UK and Moldova launched a new defence and security partnership on Wednesday in the face of threats from Russia, the UK government announced. The initiative was disclosed as British foreign secretary, David Lammy, visited the Moldovan capital Chisinau. Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, said he opposed the US decision to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles to attack inside Russia, because it will enflame the conflict, broadcaster CNN Turk cited him as saying on Wednesday. In the early afternoon, the Ukrainian air force told people to seek shelter because of a missile threat. Senior officials told people not to ignore the alert. That came shortly before Kyiv\u2019s top military spy agency GUR issued a warning about a Russian psychological operation it said involved fake messages claiming to have been sent by the agency. Russia\u2019s defence ministry has claimed that Ukraine lost 400 service personnel on the Kursk front in the last 24 hours. The ministry gave a detailed list of western-supplied Ukrainian equipment it had destroyed. The claims have not been independently verified. Ukrainian military said on Wednesday that it shot down 56 out of 122 drones and two out of six missiles launched by Russia overnight. The claims have not been independently verified. Russian media, citing the defence ministry, reports that 44 Ukrainian aircraft-type drones were intercepted over Russia overnight. The Russian defence ministry claims that 20 of them were over Novgorod oblast, which is to the south-east of St Petersburg, and some considerable distance from Ukraine. The claims have not been independently verified. The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) said on Wednesday it detained a German citizen who had been allegedly involved in organising the explosion at a gas distribution station in Kaliningrad in March this year and had been trying to enter Russia, according to state media. Russia detained the German national, named as Nikolai Gaiduk, on sabotage charges. Italian prosecutors said on Wednesday that they had opened cases against two people accused of spying for Russia \u201cfor the purposes of terrorism and subversion\u201d. In a statement, the Milan public prosecutor\u2019s office said that it was initiating criminal proceedings for suspected \u201ccorruption of (Italian) citizens by a foreign actor\u201d against the two unidentified defendants. Italian prosecutors said on Wednesday that they had opened cases against two people accused of spying for Russia \u201cfor the purposes of terrorism and subversion\u201d, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). In a statement, the Milan public prosecutor\u2019s office said that it was initiating criminal proceedings for suspected \u201ccorruption of (Italian) citizens by a foreign actor\u201d against the two unidentified defendants. They are suspected of having \u201ccollaborated with the Russian intelligence services to provide them with sensitive information\u201d beginning in May 2023. That included photos of military installations and intelligence on drone and cybersecurity technicians, according to the findings of the initial investigation, with the pair receiving payment in cryptocurrencies in return, reports AFP. Searches unveiled the interest Russian intelligence services hold in mapping out the video surveillance systems of Milan and Rome, as well as the areas of those cities with no surveillance cameras, the prosecutor\u2019s office added. In particular, the two offered taxi companies in Milan to equip their vehicles with cameras free of charge, with the aim \u2013 unbeknownst to the taxi drivers \u2013 of handing their footage over to Russia. Donald Trump\u2019s re-election as US president has prompted fears that he will cut off US support for Ukraine, forcing it into peace talks with Russia that would culminate in a settlement on terms favourable to Vladimir Putin. In an interview with the New Statesman, David Lammy has argued that Trump would not go that far. That might sound like wishful thinking, but Lammy and Keir Starmer did have dinner with Trump in the autumn. Lammy discusses that too in the interview with George Eaton. Here are the key lines. Lammy argued that Trump would not accept a deal over Ukraine that would look like a victory for Putin. Asked about Trump\u2019s stance on Ukraine, Lammy said: I\u2019ve been a politician for 25 years and I understand the different philosophies at play. There\u2019s a deep philosophical underpinning to friends in the Republican party that I\u2019ve known for many years, thinking back to people like [former US secretary of state] Condoleezza Rice. Donald Trump has some continuity with this position, which is \u2018peace through strength\u2019. What I do know about Donald Trump is that he doesn\u2019t like losers and he doesn\u2019t want to lose; he wants to get the right deal for the American people. And he knows that the right deal for the American people is peace in Europe and that means a sustainable peace \u2013 not Russia achieving its aims and coming back for more in the years ahead.\u201d US and Ukrainian officials have confirmed Kyiv employed US-made Atacms missiles to strike targets within Russia. The Kremlin stated that six missiles were launched at the town of Karachev, with fragments from one reportedly causing a significant explosion. In response, Russia has announced it is adjusting its nuclear doctrine. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow would interpret any attack against it carried out by a non-nuclear state using weapons supplied by a nuclear state as a joint assault. But what exactly are Atacms, and why has their deployment unsettled Russia so deeply? The Biden administration will allow Ukraine to use US-supplied antipersonnel landmines to help it slow Russia\u2019s battlefield progress in the war, the US defence secretary said on Wednesday, marking Washington\u2019s second major policy shift in days after it decided to let Ukraine strike targets on Russian soil with longer-range US-made missiles. The US and some other western embassies in Kyiv stayed closed on Wednesday after a threat of a major Russian aerial attack on the Ukrainian capital. US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said the change in Washington\u2019s policy on antipersonnel landmines for Ukraine follows changing tactics by the Russians, reports the Associated Press (AP). Russian ground troops are leading the movement on the battlefield, rather than forces more protected in armoured carriers, so Ukraine has \u201ca need for things that can help slow down that effort on the part of the Russians,\u201d Austin said during a trip to Laos. The announcement came two months before Donald Trump moves back into the White House. Trump has pledged to swiftly end the war and has criticised the amount the US has spent on supporting Ukraine. Biden administration officials say they are determined to help Ukraine as much as possible before Joe Biden leaves office. Antipersonnel landmines have long been criticised by charities and activists because they present a lingering threat to civilians. According to the AP, Norway\u2019s foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, called the US decision \u201cvery problematic\u201d because Ukraine is a signatory to an international convention opposing the use of landmines. Austin sought to allay concerns. He said: The landmines that we would look to provide them would be landmines that are not persistent, you know, we can control when they would self-activate, self-detonate and that makes it far more safer eventually than the things that they are creating on their own.\u201d Austin noted that Ukraine is already manufacturing its own antipersonnel landmines. And the US already provides Ukraine with anti-tank mines. Russia has routinely used landmines in the war, but those do not become inert over time. Staff at the Irish embassy in Ukraine have been told to work from home as tensions continue to escalate in the region, reports the PA news agency. It follows on from the US shutting its own embassy in Kyiv because of a \u201cpotential significant air attack\u201d by Russian president, Vladimir Putin\u2019s forces. The closure of the US embassy comes after the first use of US-supplied missiles to strike targets deep inside Russia. According to the PA news agency, the Irish premier and minister for defence, Miche\u00e1l Martin, said that \u201cfor the purpose of precaution\u201d, Ireland\u2019s embassy staff are working from home and not in the embassy building in Kyiv. \u201cThat follows consultations between different embassies across Ukraine at the moment, but there\u2019s no plans of withdrawing staff from the embassy,\u201d Martin said. He added: This is an abundance of caution here, but obviously the situation is escalated, and we believe Russia should stop this war. The amount of carnage in this war hasn\u2019t got the proper headlines, but it\u2019s absolutely unacceptable. I spoke to somebody who came back working with an NGO (non-government organisation) yesterday. He said to me that the level of fatalities of young soldiers on both sides is enormous, and it\u2019s just an appalling lack of any moral compass that leaders can preside and president [Vladimir] Putin can preside over such carnage and it should stop.\u201d He further stated that Putin is using migration as a war weapon. Martin said that the number of people seeking asylum, including from Ukraine, in Ireland is \u201cunprecedented\u201d. \u201cI think in fairness, back in 2020 no one anticipated what has now transpired,\u201d he added. \u201cI think the government has behaved responsibly, this government has done anything we possibly can, and the government is moving towards a state accommodation approach.\u201d Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, said he opposed the US decision to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles to attack inside Russia, because it will enflame the conflict, broadcaster CNN Turk cited him as saying on Wednesday, Reuters reports. Such developments might bring the region and world to the brink of larger war, and both Russia and Ukraine should maintain restraint, Erdo\u011fan was quoted as telling reporters on his flight from Brazil where he attended a G20 Summit. The UK defence secretary, John Healey, spoke with his counterpart in Kyiv on Tuesday where they discussed London\u2019s plan to support Ukraine, reports the PA news agency. Healey told the House of Commons on Wednesday: We\u2019ve seen over recent weeks significant change in the action and in the rhetoric on Ukraine, and Ukraine\u2019s action on the battlefield speaks for itself. We as a nation and as a government are doubling down on our support for Ukraine and determined to do more. I discussed this with minister [Rustem] Umerov in a call yesterday where he talked about the robust response that Ukraine is making to recent Russian escalations. That\u2019s the escalation in the attacks on Ukrainian cities and children, the escalation in attacks on their energy system and the escalation with deploying 10,000 North Korean troops in combat positions on the frontline. We discussed also our plans as the UK to support them throughout 2025. I remain committed to keeping parliament as fully informed as possible and the [shadow defence secretary, James Cartlidge] and the House, I think, will understand the reasons why at this point, I\u2019m not able to go into any further operational details.\u201d Shadow defence secretary, James Cartlidge, had raised a point of order at the despatch box after \u201cwidespread reports in the media of Storm Shadow missiles being used in Russian territory for the first time\u201d, when he asked whether the Commons had been notified of a future statement related to the conflict. Deputy speaker, Nus Ghani, said she was unaware of any indication of a future statement. The UK and Moldova launched a new defence and security partnership on Wednesday in the face of threats from Russia, the UK government announced. The initiative was disclosed as British foreign secretary, David Lammy, visited the Moldovan capital Chisinau, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The UK foreign ministry said the pact was about \u201cbuilding on extensive cooperation between the two countries and strengthening Moldovan resilience against external threats\u201d. \u201cMoldova is a vital security partner for the UK, which is why to reinforce their resilience against Russian aggression and to keep British streets safe, I am deepening cooperation on irregular migration and launching a new defence and security partnership,\u201d said Lammy. Moldova has been looking eastwards with unease since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The war has forced millions of civilians to flee their homes in Ukraine, including tens of thousands to Moldova, with more than 50,000 Ukrainian children now living in the country, the UK statement said. Earlier this month, Moldova\u2019s pro-European president, Maia Sandu, won re-election after a tense vote overshadowed by allegations of Russian meddling. It came just two weeks after a referendum in which Moldovans voted by a razor-thin margin in favour of joining the EU. The two votes laid bare divisions in the former Soviet republic, reports AFP. A large diaspora and those in the capital mostly favour joining the EU, while rural areas and the pro-Russian separatist regions of Transnistria and Gagauzia are against. In the early afternoon, the Ukrainian air force told people to seek shelter because of a missile threat. Senior officials told people not to ignore the alert, according to Reuters. That came shortly before Kyiv\u2019s top military spy agency GUR issued a warning about a Russian psychological operation it said involved fake messages claiming to have been sent by the agency. GUR said in a statement: A message is being spread via messengers and social networks \u2026 about the threat of a \u2018particularly massive\u2019 missile and bomb strike on Ukrainian cities today.\u201d Two Ukrainian military personnel told Reuters they received messages informing them that Russia would launch more than 300 drones and also use warships, warplanes and ground-based systems to fire missiles in a huge salvo. Reuters could not immediately determine how the messages were sent. One soldier said he received one from a friend, according to the news agency. The GUR spy agency said earlier that a Russian military command post had been \u201csuccessfully struck\u201d in the town of Gubkin in Russia\u2019s Belgorod region, about 168 km (105 miles) from the border with Ukraine. Reuters reports that the statement did not specify who carried out the attack, when it took place or the type of weapon used. Ukraine has also used drones for deep strikes against targets in Russia. Bloomberg later cited a western official as saying Ukraine had fired UK Storm Shadow missiles into Russia. A spokesperson for prime minister, Keir Starmer, said his office would not be commenting on reports or operational matters. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine. Dan Sabbagh in Kyiv and Andrew Roth in Washington report on the use of Storm Shadow missiles Ukraine has fired UK-made Storm Shadow missiles into Russia for the first time since the beginning of the conflict, the Guardian understands according to multiple sources. The decision to approve the strikes was made in response to the deployment of more than 10,000 North Korean troops on Russia\u2019s border with Ukraine in what UK and US officials have warned was a major escalation of the nearly three-year-old conflict. The Guardian earlier this week reported that the UK would soon approve Storm Shadow missiles for use inside Russia after the US president, Joe Biden, agreed to do the same for the similar American Atacms weapon. It was not immediately clear what Ukraine used the Storm Shadow missiles to target. Unconfirmed images distributed via the Telegram messaging app appeared to show fragments of the missile at a location with the Kursk region. One weapons expert, Trevor Ball, formerly of the US Army said the images circulating did show Storm Shadow fragments though he could verify if they were current or old pictures. The strike came one day after Ukraine used US-supplied missiles to strike targets in the Bryansk region. Western officials have indicated that they\u2019re specifically targeting the North Korean buildup in the region as well as infrastructure that may be used for a 50,000-strong offensive against a Ukrainian incursion into the region. Vladimir Putin has warned that the use of US and UK-made missiles inside Russia\u2019s borders would be tantamount to Nato entering into a direct conflict with Moscow. Defence minister Guido Crosetto has reiterated his country\u2019s support for Ukraine in parliament in Italy today. Reuters quotes the minister telling lawmakers in Rome: The government\u2019s position has not changed, we believe it is necessary to continue providing support to Ukraine in line with what we have done so far in order to achieve \u2026 the conditions for a just and lasting peace In the UK, the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson has declined to comment on media reports that UK-manufactured Storm Shadow missiles have been fired at targets within the Russian Federation. The spokesperson for prime minister Keir Starmer said his office would not be commenting on reports or operational matters, but the Guardian understands that the missiles have been used. Bloomberg also reported their use on Wednesday, citing an unnamed western official. Unconfirmed images distributed via the Telegram messaging app appeared to show fragments of the missile at a location within Kursk region. Britain had previously said Ukraine could use Storm Shadow cruise missiles within Ukrainian territory, but Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s government had been pressing for months for permission to strike at targets inside Russia. One person has been reported injured in the Belgorod region by Ukrainian shelling. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry has reminded embassies in Kyiv that the threat of an attack by Russia has been a daily reality for Ukrainians for over 1,000 days now, and said they are in constant contact with foreign partners regarding potential security threats. Tass, citing the governor of Kursk region, reports that two Ukrainian missiles have been shot down by Russian air defence in the region. The US\u2019s move to allow Ukraine to use American supplied anti-personnel land mines comes despite the weapons being banned by scores of countries, including the UK. Downing Street would not be drawn on the US and Ukrainian positions on the use of the weapons but added in \u201cterms of the UK\u2019s position and the support that it provides, it\u2019s in line with the Ottawa Convention\u201d which bans land mines. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, has confirmed that the Biden administration will allow Ukraine to use American-supplied antipersonnel land mines to help fight off Russian forces. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday during a trip to Laos, Associated Press reported that the shift in policy follows changing tactics by the Russians. Austin said Russian ground troops are leading the movement on the battlefield, rather than forces more protected in armoured carriers, so Ukraine has \u201ca need for things that can help slow down that effort on the part of the Russians.\u201d \u201cThe land mines that we would look to provide them would be land mines that are not persistent, you know, we can control when they would self-activate, self-detonate and that makes it, you know, far more, safer eventually than the things that they are creating on their own,\u201d Austin said. Ukraine\u2019s main directorate of intelligence has accused Russia of spreading misinformation that there would be a large-scale attack today in what it described as \u201ca massive information-psychological attack\u201d Reuters quotes the agency statement saying \u201cA message is being spread via messengers and social networks \u2026 about the threat of a \u2018particularly massive\u2019 missile and bomb strike on Ukrainian cities today. This message is a fake, it contains grammatical errors typical of Russian information and psychological operations.\u201d Earlier Italy, Spain and Greece followed the US in closing their Kyiv embassies over attack fears. The US embassy said it had received \u201cspecific information\u201d of a potential significant air attack and would be closed. The UK embassy in Kyiv remained open, while Germany\u2019s embassy remained open in a limited capacity. The air alert in Kyiv has ended. Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has posted to social media to say that this morning he has spoken to Poland\u2019s prime minister Donald Tusk on the phone. Air alerts have been declared in Kyiv and a number of other regions. This happens quite regularly during the day, however due to the closure of embassies by the US, Italy, Spain and Greece in anticipation of an attack on Kyiv, there is a heightened sense of alertness. Andriy Kovalenko, from Ukraine\u2019s national security and defence council has told news agency Ukrinform that Russia was \u201ctrying to sow panicky moods\u201d among Ukrainians. Dan Sabbagh is in Kyiv for the Guardian The UK embassy remains open in Kyiv. In a statement, it said: The UK Embassy in Kyiv remains open. However, the safety of our staff and British nationals in Ukraine is paramount and we keep our embassy posture and travel advice under constant review. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that Italy, Spain and Greece have all also closed their embassies in Kyiv today. The US embassy earlier said it had received \u201cspecific information\u201d of a potential significant air attack and would be closed. Suspilne reports that the intelligence indicates a combined drone and missile attack on the capital, and is not thought to be related to Russia\u2019s change in its nuclear doctrine yesterday. Russia\u2019s ministry of defence claims it has destroyed two Ukrainian drones over the Belgorod region. Russia\u2019s defence ministry has claimed that Ukraine lost 400 service personnel on the Kursk front in the last 24 hours. The ministry gave a detailed list of western-supplied Ukrainian equipment it had destroyed. The claims have not been independently verified. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that a man faces up to nine years in prison after being arrested in Kharkiv for helping men eligible to be drafted into the armed forces escape Ukraine. The 43-year-old was paid to help people travel into Moldova. Many organisations this week have been marking the 1,000 day anniversary of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Fundraising platform GoFundMe has announced that since the beginning of the war more than \u00a317m has been raised in the UK for Ukrainian causes, including media outlet the Kyiv Independent raising more than \u00a31.8m to keep publishing during the conflict. More than 200,000 individual donations have been made to appeals mentioning Ukraine during the period. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Reuters reports, has said that Ukraine and Russia should focus on peace and show restraint. Turkey\u2019s president also said that the US decision to allow longer range Ukrainian strikes on Russia would further escalate the conflict and prompt a Russian reaction. He said he opposed the move. Erdo\u011fan has repeatedly tried to position Turkey as a mediator in the conflict, and has proposed a peace plan that would involve Ukraine delaying any moves to join Nato for at least ten years and freezing the existing frontlines. That would effectively mean Ukraine conceding territory to Russia, while Russia would have to accept it had not gained full control the four Ukrainian regions it claimed to annex in 2022. Reuters reports that the Ukrainian military said on Wednesday that it shot down 56 out of 122 drones and two out of six missiles launched by Russia overnight. The claims have not been independently verified. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has reiterated that a \u201cfreeze\u201d of the conflict in Ukraine along the existing frontlines would be unacceptable to the Russian Federation. During his daily press briefing, Peskov declined to comment when asked about the US embassy closing in Kyiv, but said that Russia believed the outgoing Joe Biden administration had shown that it is fully committed to continuing the war in Ukraine and is doing everything possible to achieve that. Peskov said president Vladimir Putin\u2019s itinerary had not been altered by the decision of the US that Ukraine could use longer range missiles against Russia, but has ordered security checks on critical infrastructure facilities, including the Crimean Bridge across the Kerch Strait. Russian state-owned news agency Tass is carrying further quotes from Sergey Naryshkin, director of Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service, about the country\u2019s new nuclear doctrine. It quotes him saying that the new doctrine was met with \u201ccaution\u201d by the west, adding: They understand that the adjustments announced by Putin largely devalue the efforts of the US and Nato to inflict a strategic defeat on our country, and the planned expansion of the list of grounds for the use of nuclear weapons effectively excludes the possibility of victory over the Russian armed forces on the battlefield. In its latest operational update, Ukraine\u2019s army has said that on Tuesday there were up to 139 combat engagements on the front lines between Ukrainian and Russian forces. Sergey Naryshkin, who is director of Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service, is being quoted in Russian media as saying that attempts by Nato countries to strike inside Russia will not go \u201cunpunished\u201d. Local media reports that explosions have been heard in Kherson. This is not uncommon, as the Dnipro river, on which the city lies to the north, marks a frontline between Ukrainian forces and Russian forces, who occupy the southern portion of the Kherson region. The chief of staff in Belarus, Pavel Muraveiko, has described US moves to allow Ukraine to deploy longer-range missiles and anti-personnel mines as \u201cirresponsible\u201d, Reuters reports. In a television interview in France, foreign minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot has dismissed Vladimir Putin\u2019s approval of a new nuclear doctrine yesterday as rhetoric, and, Reuters reports, said \u201cWe are not intimidated.\u201d The change in nuclear doctrine yesterday lowered the threshold for Russia\u2019s use of nuclear weapons, with a significant development being that Russia says it now considers a nuclear response justified if it is on the receiving end of aggression by a non-nuclear power that is being aided by a nuclear power. The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) said on Wednesday it detained a German citizen who had been allegedly involved in organising the explosion at a gas distribution station in Kaliningrad in March this year and had been trying to enter Russia, according to state media. Russia detained the German national, named as Nikolai Gaiduk, on sabotage charges. Authorities said he \u201cis implicated in the March 2024 explosion at a gas distribution station\u201d in Kaliningrad, the Russian region sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. The man had returned to Russia \u201cto organise acts of sabotage on local energy infrastructure\u201d, according to a statement by the FSB, which was quoted by news agencies. A video confession by the man was shown on state television. Russian media, citing the defence ministry, reports that 44 Ukrainian aircraft-type drones were intercepted over Russia overnight. The Russian defence ministry claims that 20 of them were over Novgorod oblast, which is to the south-east of St Petersburg, and some considerable distance from Ukraine. The claims have not been independently verified. A special hotline in place to deflate crises between the Kremlin and the White House, created after the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, is not currently being used, the Kremlin said on Wednesday, as nuclear risks rise amid the highest tensions between Russia and West in decades, Reuters reports. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday lowered the threshold for a nuclear strike in response to a broader range of conventional attacks, days after reports said Washington had allowed Ukraine to use US-made weapons to strike deep into Russia. Putin has altered Russia\u2019s so-called \u201cnuclear doctrine\u201d several times since the invasion of Ukraine, without ever making good on nuclear threats. \u201cWe have a special secure line for communication between the two presidents, Russia and the United States. Moreover, even for video communication,\u201d Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov told TASS state news agency. But when asked whether this channel is currently in use, he said, \u201cNo.\u201d Ukraine used US Atacms missiles to strike Russian territory on Tuesday, taking advantage of the newly granted permission from the outgoing administration of US President Joe Biden on the war\u2019s 1,000th day. Russian diplomats say the crisis between Moscow and Washington now is comparable to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis when the two cold war superpowers came closest to intentional nuclear war, and that the West is making a mistake if it thinks Russia will back down over Ukraine. Some more information on the US embassy closure in Kyiv. Further to its post on X, the US Department of State Consular Affairs published a notice on the embassy website saying the closure was \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d. The US embassy in Kyiv has received specific information of a potential significant air attack on November 20. Out of an abundance of caution, the embassy will be closed, and embassy employees are being instructed to shelter in place. The US embassy recommends US citizens be prepared to immediately shelter in the event an air alert is announced. The warning comes a day after Ukraine used US Atacms missiles to strike Russian territory, taking advantage of newly granted permission from the outgoing administration of US President Joe Biden on the war\u2019s 1,000th day. Dan Sabbagh is the Guardian\u2019s defence and security editor, reporting from Kyiv Ukraine\u2019s power network is at \u201cheightened risk of catastrophic failure\u201d after Russia\u2019s missile and drone attack on Sunday, Greenpeace has warned, raising fears about the safety of the country\u2019s three operational nuclear power stations. The strikes by Moscow were aimed at electricity substations \u201ccritical to the operation of Ukraine\u2019s nuclear plants\u201d and there is a possibility that the reactors could lose power and become unsafe, according to a briefing note prepared for the Guardian. Shaun Burnie, nuclear expert at Greenpeace Ukraine, said: It is clear that Russia is using the threat of a nuclear disaster as a major military lever to defeat Ukraine. But by undertaking the attacks Russia is risking a nuclear catastrophe in Europe, which is comparable to Fukushima in 2011, Chornobyl in 1986 or even worse. The pressure group called on Russia to immediately halt its attacks on Ukraine\u2019s energy grid and for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to deploy permanent monitors in substations critical to the country\u2019s nuclear plants. The IAEA conducted one inspection in late October, but has not committed to return. More on the news that Joe Biden has authorised the provision of antipersonnel landmines to Ukraine, which was first reported by the Washington Post. Here is some further context from the Post\u2019s story: The Biden administration is deeply concerned about Russia\u2019s assaults against Ukraine\u2019s frontlines in recent weeks and sees a pressing need to blunt the advance, officials said. The Pentagon believes that the provision of the mines is among the most helpful steps the Biden administration can do to help slow Russia\u2019s attack, officials said. One official said the type of antipersonnel landmine is \u201cnonpersistent,\u201d meaning that the mines self-destruct or lose battery charge to render them inactive within days or weeks, reducing the danger to civilians. The official said that Ukrainian policymakers had committed to not deploying the mines in densely populated areas. Arms control experts said that even nonpersistent mines pose a safety hazard. \u201cRussia is attacking Ukrainian lines in the east with waves of troops, regardless of the casualties that they\u2019re suffering,\u201d one of the officials said. \u201cSo the Ukrainians are obviously taking losses, and more towns and cities are at risk of falling. These mines were made specifically to combat exactly this.\u201d Some of 10,900 North Korean troops sent to Kursk have been fighting in elite Russian airborne and marine units against Ukraine, according to a lawmaker on the intelligence committee of the South Korean parliament. Park Sun-won, citing the South\u2019s spy agency, said North Korea had also shipped additional arms for the war in Ukraine, including self-propelled howitzers and multiple rocket launchers. Park added that the North Korean foreign minister Choe Son Hui\u2019s meeting with Vladimir Putin in Moscow this month was unusual in terms of protocol, and likely went beyond exchanging greetings, to cover more significant issues including a possible visit to Russia by Kim Jong-un. The spy agency was still trying to determine the exact number of North Korean troop casualties and whether any had surrendered amid conflicting information, Park said. The US embassy in Kyiv has received \u201cspecific information\u201d of a potential significant air attack on Wednesday and will be closed, the US Department of State Consular Affairs said in a post on X. It recommended US citizens to be prepared to immediately shelter in the event an air alert is announced. The US president, Joe Biden, has authorised the provision of antipersonnel landmines to Ukraine, according to reports, in a step that will bolster Kyiv\u2019s defence against advancing Russian troops but also attract criticism from arms control groups. Ukraine had committed not to use the mines in densely populated areas, an unnamed official told the Washington Post, which first reported the development. It comes as Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin \u2013 already angered by the Biden administration allowing Ukraine to use US-supplied longer-range missiles to strike targets deeper within Russian territory \u2013 formally lowered the threshold for Moscow\u2019s use of its nuclear weapons. A hotline in place to deflate crises between the Kremlin and the White House, created after the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, was not being used, the Kremlin said on Wednesday, amid the highest tensions between Russia and the west in decades. Putin has altered Russia\u2019s so-called \u201cnuclear doctrine\u201d several times since the invasion of Ukraine, without ever making good on nuclear threats. North Korean troops have participated in some battles as part of Russia\u2019s airborne and marine units, while Pyongyang has shipped additional arms including mechanised howitzers and rocket launchers to Russia, a South Korean lawmaker has said, citing his country\u2019s spy agency. The agency was still trying to determine the exact number of North Korean troop casualties, Park Sun-won said. Meanwhile, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has told Fox News that his country \u201cwill lose\u201d its war against Russia if the US cuts military funding to Kyiv. \u201cIf they cut, we will \u2013 I think we will lose,\u201d said the Ukrainian president. \u201cWe will fight. We have our production, but it\u2019s not enough to prevail. And I think it\u2019s not enough to survive.\u201d The US president-elect, Donald Trump, is a vocal sceptic of the billions that the Biden administration has given to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began in 2022. Trump\u2019s surrogates have voiced vehement criticism of Biden\u2019s decision to let Ukraine use US-supplied long-range missiles for attacks inside Russia, accusing him of a dangerous escalation. With Russia gaining ground, and increasing talk of negotiations, Ukraine is wary of being at a disadvantage when it comes to hashing out a peace settlement. Zelenskyy told Fox that unity between Ukraine and the US was \u201cmost important.\u201d Trump, he said, could influence Vladimir Putin to end the war, \u201cbecause he is much more stronger\u201d than the Russian president. In other developments: The US called on Russia \u201cto stop this bellicose and the irresponsible rhetoric\u201d, but said it has not seen any reason to adjust its nuclear posture. US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d by comments by the Kremlin over the revised nuclear doctrine. The UK\u2019s prime minister, Keir Starmer, also accused Russia of being guilty of making \u201cirresponsible rhetoric\u201d. In a direct message to the Russian president, Starmer added: \u201cOn day 1,000 of Russia\u2019s illegal war in Ukraine, I say again: \u2018End the war. Get out of Ukraine\u2019.\u201d Ukraine fired US-made long-range missiles into Russia for the first time since the Biden administration lifted restrictions on their use. The target appeared to be an ammunition warehouse. Ukraine\u2019s general staff said it hit a military arsenal of the 1046th logistics centre outside the city of Karachev without confirming the use of the missiles. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said Ukraine launched six US-made Atacms missiles targeting the south-western Bryansk region overnight. It claimed that five of the missiles were shot down and another was damaged. It said debris from the rockets caused a fire at an unnamed military facility. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, did not directly confirm the missile attack targeting Bryansk but said: \u201cWe now have Atacms, Ukrainian long-range capabilities, and we will use them.\u201d The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, appeared to suggest that Russia might respond with nuclear weapons if Ukraine used western-supplied missiles to strike targets inside Russia. The Kremlin said the purpose of its updated nuclear doctrine was to make potential enemies understand the inevitability of retaliation for an attack on Russia or its allies. Russia\u2019s revised nuclear doctrine declares that a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on his country. The doctrine also states that an attack using conventional missiles, drones or other aircraft could be seen as justification for a nuclear response. Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the Ukrainian attack was a clear signal that the west wanted to escalate the conflict. \u201cWithout the Americans, it is impossible to use these hi-tech missiles, as Putin has repeatedly said,\u201d Lavrov said in Rio de Janeiro for the G20 summit. Ukraine\u2019s western allies criticised the final G20 communique as inadequate for failing to highlight Russia\u2019s invasion of its neighbour in 2022 as the conflict entered its 1,000th day. It was significantly weaker than that of the previous year, only highlighting humanitarian suffering in Ukraine and the importance of territorial integrity. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker T\u00fcrk, marked the \u201cgrim\u201d milestone of 1,000 days since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine by saying that it has been \u201c1,000 days too many of senseless pain and suffering.\u201d A statement by T\u00fcrk\u2019s spokesperson on Tuesday said the OHCHR has verified that at least 12,162 civilians have been killed since 24 February 2022, among them 659 children. At least another 26,919 civilians have been injured, it said. Denmark is making a new donation of about \u20ac130m for development of Ukraine\u2019s arms industry, the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, has announced. \u201cAnd make no mistake, our support is long-term.\u201d Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine and Denmark had created a \u201cspecial model\u201d to bring in investments from other countries.",

But do not bet against him signing on again. Twelve months from now, keep an eye out, because the extension agreed this week is a third in a row that has occurred in November.",

Ukrainian media reported that the site may have been used by North Korean and Russian officers.</p> \n<p>Unconfirmed images distributed via the Telegram messaging app appeared to show fragments of the missile at a location in the Kursk region. One weapons expert, Trevor Ball, formerly of the US army, said the images circulating did show Storm Shadow fragments, though he could not verify if they were current or old pictures.</p> \n<p>There was no official confirmation from the UK, though the defence secretary, John Healey, appeared to hint at developments as he spoke to the Commons as reports of the attack in Kursk began to circulate.</p> \n<p>Healey said he had spoken with his Ukrainian counterpart, Rustem Umerov, on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen over recent weeks significant change in the action and in the rhetoric on Ukraine, and Ukraine\u2019s action on the battlefield speaks for itself,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>It marks a rapid turnaround in the UK-Ukraine relationship, following complaints that Kyiv was frustrated by a refusal by London to supply a fresh batch of Storm Shadow. The UK was said to be stung by the criticism and the complaints are partly believed to have contributed to a change of heart.</p> \n<p>A second element was a change in policy by the outgoing Biden administration. The Storm Shadow strikes came a day after Ukraine used Atacms missiles to hit targets in the Bryansk region.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"22a31959-65d0-4740-b532-8bc8fdb25b1b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WSjxs1X2ROg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Western officials have indicated they are specifically targeting the North Korean buildup in the Kursk region, as well as infrastructure that may be used for a 50,000-strong offensive against a Ukrainian incursion there.</p> \n<p>Storm Shadow missiles are an Anglo-French cruise missile with a maximum range of about 155 miles (250km), which so far have been used to strike Russian targets in occupied Crimea, including the naval headquarters of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet. They are useful for precision targeting of bunkers and ammunition stores.</p> \n<p>Vladimir Putin has warned that the use of US and UK-made missiles inside Russia\u2019s borders would be tantamount to Nato entering into a direct conflict with Moscow, though western politicians have dismissed his comments as empty threats.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/11/maryno_russia_locator/giv-4559ylS8qSTu7ORR/\" data-alt=\"Map of fighting in Russian Kursk region\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/11/maryno_russia_locator/giv-4559ylS8qSTu7ORR/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Western officials have warned that Russia could escalate strikes on critical infrastructure in Ukraine or use other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/19/hybrid-warfare-russia-ukraine\">hybrid warfare tactics</a> against targets in Europe and other US allies around the world.<strong> </strong>British spy chiefs have accused Russia of trying to \u201cgenerate mayhem\u201d on the streets of the UK with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/17/russia-wants-to-create-havoc-if-it-is-behind-dhl-fires-says-air-freight-expert\">arson and sabotage campaigns</a>, including the secreting of incendiary devices in parcels sent via DHL, one of which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/16/russia-suspected-of-planting-device-on-plane-that-caused-uk-warehouse-fire\">caught light in a Birmingham warehouse</a> in July, starting a small fire.</p> \n<p>The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Moscow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/putin-warns-us-over-using-long-range-missiles-by-signing-new-nuclear-doctrine-ukraine\">would respond \u201cappropriately\u201d</a> a day after Ukraine fired six of the newly approved Atacms missiles into an ammunition warehouse in the south-western Bryansk region.</p> \n<p>Hours earlier, Putin signed a revised nuclear doctrine lowering the threshold for using nuclear weapons amid warnings from Russian MPs that the US action was bringing \u201cworld war three\u201d closer.</p> \n<p>Overnight, the Pentagon said it had seen no sign that Russia was planning to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, and accused Russian politicians of engaging in irresponsible rhetoric.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to monitor, but we don\u2019t have any indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon within Ukraine,\u201d said the Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh.</p> \n<p>Earlier on Wednesday, the US announced it had temporarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/20/ukraine-landmines-biden-approves\">closed its embassy in Kyiv</a> after receiving warning of a \u201cpotential significant air attack\u201d, advising American citizens to be prepared to move immediately to a shelter in the event of an air raid warning.</p> \n<p>Such warnings are rare and likely to be based on specific intelligence, prompting a nervous day in Kyiv, where the mayor, Vitali Klitschko, told the public not to ignore the air raid warning that came shortly before 2pm.</p> \n<p>City residents gathered in Kyiv\u2019s metro stations and other locations to take shelter, and there was a heightened concern among officials, though one member of the government told the Guardian they were not aware of any particular threat.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what could happen \u2013 it could be another major attack like Sunday, when they fired over 200 missiles and drones,\u201d one security official said. \u201cThe Americans had some signal intelligence and were acting according to their protocol.\u201d</p> \n<p>The state department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, later told reporters the embassy was expected to return to normal operations on Thursday.</p> \n<p>The US had also reportedly approved the provision of anti-personnel landmines to Ukraine.</p> \n<p>In his nightly video address, Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the US and Joe Biden for the landmines which he described as \u201cessential \u2026 to stop Russian assaults\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f4b512b5-1e3e-4bd8-84ca-f9655ab53608\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L5UW8Q5J9Oo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Ukrainian media later on Wednesday announced that Russia had scrambled up to seven Tu-95 long-range bombers over its Engels air force base in preparation for a potential missile strike against Ukraine.</p> \n<p>The embassies of Italy, Spain and Greece also closed temporarily on Wednesday after the US announcement.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ukraine has fired UK-made Storm Shadow missiles into Russia for the first time since the beginning of the conflict, multiple sources have told the Guardian. The decision to approve the strikes was made in response to the deployment of more than 10,000 North Korean troops on Russia\u2019s border with Ukraine, which UK and US officials warned was a significant escalation of the near three-year conflict. The Guardian reported earlier this week that the UK would soon approve Storm Shadow missiles for use inside Russia after the US president, Joe Biden, agreed to do the same for the similar American Atacms weapons. Videos uploaded to social media and circulated by pro-Russian war bloggers indicated that up to 12 missiles struck a target believed to be a command headquarters in the village of Maryno, the first confirmed use of British weapons on Russian soil during the war. Ukrainian media reported that the site may have been used by North Korean and Russian officers. Unconfirmed images distributed via the Telegram messaging app appeared to show fragments of the missile at a location in the Kursk region. One weapons expert, Trevor Ball, formerly of the US army, said the images circulating did show Storm Shadow fragments, though he could not verify if they were current or old pictures. There was no official confirmation from the UK, though the defence secretary, John Healey, appeared to hint at developments as he spoke to the Commons as reports of the attack in Kursk began to circulate. Healey said he had spoken with his Ukrainian counterpart, Rustem Umerov, on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen over recent weeks significant change in the action and in the rhetoric on Ukraine, and Ukraine\u2019s action on the battlefield speaks for itself,\u201d he said. It marks a rapid turnaround in the UK-Ukraine relationship, following complaints that Kyiv was frustrated by a refusal by London to supply a fresh batch of Storm Shadow. The UK was said to be stung by the criticism and the complaints are partly believed to have contributed to a change of heart. A second element was a change in policy by the outgoing Biden administration. The Storm Shadow strikes came a day after Ukraine used Atacms missiles to hit targets in the Bryansk region. Western officials have indicated they are specifically targeting the North Korean buildup in the Kursk region, as well as infrastructure that may be used for a 50,000-strong offensive against a Ukrainian incursion there. Storm Shadow missiles are an Anglo-French cruise missile with a maximum range of about 155 miles (250km), which so far have been used to strike Russian targets in occupied Crimea, including the naval headquarters of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet. They are useful for precision targeting of bunkers and ammunition stores. Vladimir Putin has warned that the use of US and UK-made missiles inside Russia\u2019s borders would be tantamount to Nato entering into a direct conflict with Moscow, though western politicians have dismissed his comments as empty threats. Western officials have warned that Russia could escalate strikes on critical infrastructure in Ukraine or use other hybrid warfare tactics against targets in Europe and other US allies around the world. British spy chiefs have accused Russia of trying to \u201cgenerate mayhem\u201d on the streets of the UK with arson and sabotage campaigns, including the secreting of incendiary devices in parcels sent via DHL, one of which caught light in a Birmingham warehouse in July, starting a small fire. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Moscow would respond \u201cappropriately\u201d a day after Ukraine fired six of the newly approved Atacms missiles into an ammunition warehouse in the south-western Bryansk region. Hours earlier, Putin signed a revised nuclear doctrine lowering the threshold for using nuclear weapons amid warnings from Russian MPs that the US action was bringing \u201cworld war three\u201d closer. Overnight, the Pentagon said it had seen no sign that Russia was planning to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, and accused Russian politicians of engaging in irresponsible rhetoric. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to monitor, but we don\u2019t have any indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon within Ukraine,\u201d said the Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh. Earlier on Wednesday, the US announced it had temporarily closed its embassy in Kyiv after receiving warning of a \u201cpotential significant air attack\u201d, advising American citizens to be prepared to move immediately to a shelter in the event of an air raid warning. Such warnings are rare and likely to be based on specific intelligence, prompting a nervous day in Kyiv, where the mayor, Vitali Klitschko, told the public not to ignore the air raid warning that came shortly before 2pm. City residents gathered in Kyiv\u2019s metro stations and other locations to take shelter, and there was a heightened concern among officials, though one member of the government told the Guardian they were not aware of any particular threat. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what could happen \u2013 it could be another major attack like Sunday, when they fired over 200 missiles and drones,\u201d one security official said. \u201cThe Americans had some signal intelligence and were acting according to their protocol.\u201d The state department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, later told reporters the embassy was expected to return to normal operations on Thursday. The US had also reportedly approved the provision of anti-personnel landmines to Ukraine. In his nightly video address, Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the US and Joe Biden for the landmines which he described as \u201cessential \u2026 to stop Russian assaults\u201d. Ukrainian media later on Wednesday announced that Russia had scrambled up to seven Tu-95 long-range bombers over its Engels air force base in preparation for a potential missile strike against Ukraine. The embassies of Italy, Spain and Greece also closed temporarily on Wednesday after the US announcement.",

      "body": "<p>My father, Peter Higgins, who has died aged 93, was a urologist in Stoke-on-Trent. A humane and considerate surgeon, he was committed to improving the experience of patients in the NHS, especially through his pioneering work in clinical audit. He also made advances in treating conditions including acute urinary retention. He had a voracious appetite for history, was a collector of ceramics, and nursed a lifelong, mildly disappointed love for Sheffield United.</p> <p>He grew up in Sheffield, the son of Eileen (nee Morris) and Henry, the manager of a small branch of Boots, and shared his small bedroom with his grandfather, an Irish steelworker. The first in his family to attend university, he studied medicine at Balliol College, Oxford, working a variety of jobs \u2013 ice-cream salesman, Butlin\u2019s entertainment officer \u2013 in the vacations. In Oxford, he met Pamela Deane, a student nurse; they married in 1955.</p> <p>He did his clinical training at the London Hospital, and, in 1958, when their first son Robert was just over a year old, he started military service in the RAF. He was posted to Christmas Island in the Pacific, in the wake of the nuclear tests. At a lobster party, one of the officers passed a Geiger counter over the bellies of those present. After that, no more lobster.</p> <p>In 1962 he undertook a year\u2019s exchange in Montreal. For the last five weeks of the trip, the family camped their way across the US in the Mini they had shipped over from the UK, Pamela six months pregnant with their second son, Rupert. The Mini broke down at the top of the Rockies; he wrote up the adventure for the Manchester Guardian. In 1964, Peter was working on his MCh thesis when he was summoned to Heathrow, where an Ilyushin 18 was waiting for a small surgical team. They operated that night on the Polish president. He later speculated that no Polish surgeon was willing to take the responsibility: the patient, Aleksander Zawadzki, was clearly already dying, and duly did so later that year.</p> <p>Peter was appointed a consultant in 1967 at what is now the Royal Stoke university hospital, where I was later born. For many years the city\u2019s sole urological surgeon, he dealt with a heavy workload without accruing a waiting list. His modest private practice included performing vasectomies at a consulting room at our house, where I took it for granted that a succession of ashen-faced men would arrive on a Saturday morning. When the time came, he self-administered the procedure, without mishap.</p> <p>The Potteries provided our father with one of his most enduring passions \u2013 commemorative pottery, of which he amassed an important collection. After retirement to the Cotswolds and then Oxford, he completed a PhD on medical care in prisons in the 19th century, which he wrote up for his book Punish or Treat? (2007). He was a charming raconteur, his droll wit influenced by his favourite novelist, Evelyn Waugh. In their later years, he and our mother travelled widely, until her death in 2018.</p> <p>He is survived by Robert, Rupert and me, by four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, and by his sister, Shelagh.</p>",

      "bodyText": "My father, Peter Higgins, who has died aged 93, was a urologist in Stoke-on-Trent. A humane and considerate surgeon, he was committed to improving the experience of patients in the NHS, especially through his pioneering work in clinical audit. He also made advances in treating conditions including acute urinary retention. He had a voracious appetite for history, was a collector of ceramics, and nursed a lifelong, mildly disappointed love for Sheffield United. He grew up in Sheffield, the son of Eileen (nee Morris) and Henry, the manager of a small branch of Boots, and shared his small bedroom with his grandfather, an Irish steelworker. The first in his family to attend university, he studied medicine at Balliol College, Oxford, working a variety of jobs \u2013 ice-cream salesman, Butlin\u2019s entertainment officer \u2013 in the vacations. In Oxford, he met Pamela Deane, a student nurse; they married in 1955. He did his clinical training at the London Hospital, and, in 1958, when their first son Robert was just over a year old, he started military service in the RAF. He was posted to Christmas Island in the Pacific, in the wake of the nuclear tests. At a lobster party, one of the officers passed a Geiger counter over the bellies of those present. After that, no more lobster. In 1962 he undertook a year\u2019s exchange in Montreal. For the last five weeks of the trip, the family camped their way across the US in the Mini they had shipped over from the UK, Pamela six months pregnant with their second son, Rupert. The Mini broke down at the top of the Rockies; he wrote up the adventure for the Manchester Guardian. In 1964, Peter was working on his MCh thesis when he was summoned to Heathrow, where an Ilyushin 18 was waiting for a small surgical team. They operated that night on the Polish president. He later speculated that no Polish surgeon was willing to take the responsibility: the patient, Aleksander Zawadzki, was clearly already dying, and duly did so later that year. Peter was appointed a consultant in 1967 at what is now the Royal Stoke university hospital, where I was later born. For many years the city\u2019s sole urological surgeon, he dealt with a heavy workload without accruing a waiting list. His modest private practice included performing vasectomies at a consulting room at our house, where I took it for granted that a succession of ashen-faced men would arrive on a Saturday morning. When the time came, he self-administered the procedure, without mishap. The Potteries provided our father with one of his most enduring passions \u2013 commemorative pottery, of which he amassed an important collection. After retirement to the Cotswolds and then Oxford, he completed a PhD on medical care in prisons in the 19th century, which he wrote up for his book Punish or Treat? (2007). He was a charming raconteur, his droll wit influenced by his favourite novelist, Evelyn Waugh. In their later years, he and our mother travelled widely, until her death in 2018. He is survived by Robert, Rupert and me, by four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, and by his sister, Shelagh.",

Terms of the purchase were not disclosed, but Buckingham writes in her letter that the land was purchased from a woman who previously refused to let state officials build a border wall on her property. Now, the state plans to build 1.5 miles of the border wall where they were once denied. The rest of the 353, 598 acres, collectively known as \u201cBrewster Ranch\u201d, located near Big Bend national park, were purchased in October for roughly $245m from the billionaire and tobacco tycoon Brad Kelley, the state\u2019s largest private landowner. It was one of the most significant public purchases of land in the history of Texas. Such an offer to Trump comes in the wake of a campaign in which he promised immigration crackdowns. Trump confirmed on Monday that he plans to declare a national emergency and activate the US military to carry out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. The president-elect has also appointed the former Ice director Tom Homan as his border czar, who has vowed to carry out \u201cthe biggest deportation this country has ever seen\u201d. \u201cThey ain\u2019t seen shit yet. Wait until 2025,\u201d the Heritage Foundation fellow and Project 2025 contributor said before his official appointment. When questioned about policies in the previous Trump administration that led to family separation in an interview for CBS\u2019s 60 Minutes, Homan said there was a simple solution: \u201cFamilies can be deported together.\u201d Buckingham said she was \u201ccommitted to using every available means at my disposal to gain complete operational security of our border\u201d.",

Her former teammate, the journalist Assile Toufaily, said that \u201cthe whole women\u2019s football community in Lebanon is in disbelief\u201d and expressed her frustration at the lack of a reaction from the wider women\u2019s football community. \u201cI don\u2019t expect male footballers to have any sort of reaction. I had hoped that it was different for female footballers,\u201d she said. \u201cThe community is different, players are often more vocal about such issues, yet their silence is very loud. \u201cC\u00e9line is like any other young footballer who wants to dream big and play the sport she loves. She has faced several barriers, she won multiple trophies \u2026 I\u2019m waiting for her, we\u2019re all waiting for her.\u201d A statement posted to the BFA\u2019s official Instagram account, said: \u201cWe are sending all our love and prayers to C\u00e9line Haidar from the BFA Women\u2019s team. In such challenging times, we are deeply saddened to see her go through this tough moment. C\u00e9line, you are strong, and we know you\u2019ll come back even stronger.\u201d Across the weekend the Israeli Defence Force\u2019s Arabic-speaking spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, announced evacuation orders in several areas in the southern suburbs of the capital city, telling those nearby they must evacuate and keep a distance of at least 500m from the targeted buildings. On Sunday he said: \u201cOver the past week, the air force attacked about 50 terrorist targets in the southern suburbs of Beirut, a stronghold of the terrorist Hezbollah, which continues to use the area to plot terrorist attacks against the State of Israel.\u201d The AFP reported that Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency said that one raid \u201ccompletely destroyed a 12-storey residential building near the Mar Mikhael church\u201d in Chiyah, while a \u201cresidential complex\u201d in Haret Hreik and a site close to Saint-Georges hospital were also among the buildings hit.",

The standoff, which threatens to cost them their seats, reflects a complicated view of the country\u2019s head of state, who lives thousands of miles away, and increasingly serves as a reminder to a history of violence and broken promises In mid-October, residents of Dawson City \u2013 notorious as the birthplace of the \u201cSour Toe\u201d cocktail which included a mummified human toe \u2013 voted to replace the town\u2019s mayor and council, turning the page on an administration gripped by scandal and legal wrangling. But since then the council has been in procedural limbo. \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything legally required of us \u2026 So we are sort of, kind of council, and I\u2019m sort of, kind of the mayor,\u201d the mayor-elect, Stephen Johnson, told the Canadian Press. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a sticky situation.\u201d Under Yukon\u2019s Municipal Act, elected officials are required to take the oath of allegiance and an oath of office. But shortly before the incoming council was due to take office, councillor-elect Darwyn Lynn, a member of the Tr\u2019ondek Hwech\u2019in First Nation, told colleagues he wasn\u2019t comfortable pledging allegiance to the crown due to its troubled history with Indigenous peoples. Councillors took the oath of office on 5 November, but have refused to swear or affirm they \u201cwill be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King Charles III\u201d and his \u201cheirs and successors according to law\u201d. Johnson said the council decided to refuse the oath of allegiance in solidarity with Lynn, acknowledging a colonial history of displacement for the people living and using the lands for generations before the arrival settlers. The town of Dawson \u2013 known as the \u201cParis of the North\u201d \u2013 is located on the former site of Tr\u2019och\u00ebk, a valuable hunting and fishing camp at the confluence of the Klondike and Yukon Rivers.

Even though the gold rush soon ended, prompting an exodus from the northern community, Tr\u2019och\u00ebk never returned as a fishing and hunting camp.

And also we\u2019re not doing this to go, \u2018Rah, rah, look at us,\u2019 to poke everybody across Canada, to get rid of the crown,\u201d Johnson told the Canadian Press. \u201cIt was just something we wanted to do together to show solidarity in what we do here in this town.\u201d The row over the pledge is rare, but not the first time elected officials have questioned the requirement they pledge allegiance to Canada\u2019s head of state. In 2022, Quebec passed legislation ending elected officials\u2019 required oath to King Charles. At the time, the provincial lawmaker Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois called it \u201ca relic from the past\u201d. At the same time, some Indigenous leaders point to treaties signed with the crown as solemn agreements that represent a trust both nations can live peacefully side by side. The territorial government says it is considering alternative options around the oath to ensure all council members feel included and respected within the governance structures while still complying with legislative requirements.

      "bodyText": "The author Cormac McCarthy, who died last year aged 89, began a relationship with a 16-year-old when he was 42 and the woman became his \u201csecret muse\u201d, Vanity Fair has reported. The author of The Road and Suttree gave very few interviews, so little is known of his private life other than that he married three times and lived in Spain and Texas before settling in New Mexico. Augusta Britt, now 64, told Vanity Fair she was \u201cin and out of foster care\u201d when she first saw McCarthy at a motel pool in Tucson, Arizona, that she would frequently visit. The author looked familiar, and when she got home she realised she had recognised him from the author photo on the back of the novel she was reading, McCarthy\u2019s debut, The Orchard Keeper. The next day, she brought her copy of the book to the motel, along with a Colt revolver, which she said she had stolen from the man who ran her foster home and \u201chad taken to wearing\u201d, having experienced violence at the hands of her father and foster parents. The author was still there, and apparently asked her if she was planning to shoot him \u2013 to which she responded no, she wanted him to sign her book. Britt said the pair began a relationship and in 1977, after a beating led to her being admitted to hospital, McCarthy asked her to leave her home and come to Mexico with him. She accepted and they travelled along the path of Blood Meridian, the novel McCarthy was researching at the time, published in 1985, which follows a fictional teenager from Tennessee who runs away from home and travels across the US-Mexico border. Britt told Vanity Fair that the state police and the FBI were after them at one point \u2013 McCarthy feared being found guilty of statutory rape or in breach of the Mann Act, which criminalises trafficking \u2013 although Vanity Fair did not find any evidence of a police or federal investigation. Britt said the pair had sex for the first time when McCarthy was 43 and she was 17. \u201cI loved him,\u201d she told Vanity Fair. \u201cHe was my safety.

Not his No 2, JD Vance, nor his wife, Melania, but another man a quarter-century younger and about $300bn heavier: Elon Musk. The two hunkered down in Mar-a-Lago on the night of the election, celebrating the results. This week they were in Texas, watching Mr Musk\u2019s staff test-launch a spacecraft. During the campaign, Mr Musk <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-megadonors-2024-election/\">personally chipped in $130m</a>, made speeches at rallies and organised campaigns to \u201cget out the vote\u201d. Last week, the world\u2019s richest man was picked by the president-elect to run a new \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d. So close are the pair that Mr Musk dubs himself \u201cFirst Buddy\u201d.</p> <p>American politics has always been coiled around money, tight as a vine around a trunk. Nearly 25 years ago, George W Bush joked at <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4500665/user-clip-people-call-elites-call-base\">a swanky white-tie dinner</a>:&nbsp;\u201cSome people call you the elites; I call you my base.\u201d Nor is it confined to the right wing. Of the two main candidates in this month\u2019s election, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/30/kamala-harris-has-more-billionaires-prominently-backing-her-than-trump-bezos-and-griffin-weigh-in-updated/\">more billionaires backed Kamala Harris</a>. One result is a highly warped politics that works against the very people it urges to go out and vote.</p> <p>The renowned political scientists <a href=\"https://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hacker_Pierson_APSA_2019.pdf\">Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson</a> observe that many rich countries have succumbed to rightwing populism \u2013 but Mr Trump is different. He talks populist, but walks plutocratic. According to Prof Hacker and Prof Pierson he is \u201cfixated on helping the wealthiest Americans\u201d. The $1.5tn of tax cuts he made in his first term meant that, for the first time in history, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/09/trump-tax-cuts-helped-billionaires-pay-less\">billionaires paid a lower rate than the working class</a>.</p> <p>The Republicans were always the party of big business, but Mr Trump is turning them into a playpen for oligarchs. This autumn, Mr Musk was the only boss of a Fortune 100 business to donate to the Republicans, compared with <a href=\"https://time.com/6692523/ceos-business-world-donald-trump-2024/\">the 42 company heads who supported Mr Bush</a> in 2004. Mr Trump\u2019s donors do not come from the big institutions of corporate America but are often drawn from casinos, crypto currency, fossil fuels and shadow banking. </p> <p>Business leaders used to argue that their support for politicians was in the hope of securing long-term stability and competent economic stewardship. This time, some appear to have been made very particular promises. In April, Mr Trump convened a dinner for fossil-fuel executives and lobbyists, where he reportedly demanded <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/09/climate/trump-oil-gas-mar-a-lago.html\">they donate $1bn</a>. In return, they\u2019d face fewer pesky regulations on where they could drill. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole different class,\u201d one longtime handler of Republican donors told <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/10/28/how-republican-billionaires-learned-to-love-trump-again\">the&nbsp;New Yorker</a> last month. Rather than a photo op and a grand dinner, \u201cthey want to essentially get their issues in the White House \u2026 They want someone to take their calls.\u201d</p> <p>And they probably don\u2019t want too much scrutiny. Mr Musk\u2019s appointment to the \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d is both less and more than it seems. It\u2019s not a Washington job that would burden the tech billionaire with <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-11-14/elon-musk-conflicts-of-interest\">regulations around conflicts of interest</a>; rather he will \u201cprovide advice and guidance from outside of government\u201d. This sounds like unparalleled access without much responsibility, which leaves the American public reliant on Mr Trump\u2019s personal ethics to safeguard their democracy. What exactly does Earth\u2019s richest man see in the president-elect of the world\u2019s biggest superpower? It is a question that will keep coming around \u2013 not for Mr Musk alone, but for so many wealthy supporters of America\u2019s next leader.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Of the two main candidates in this month\u2019s election, more billionaires backed Kamala Harris. One result is a highly warped politics that works against the very people it urges to go out and vote. The renowned political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson observe that many rich countries have succumbed to rightwing populism \u2013 but Mr Trump is different. He talks populist, but walks plutocratic. According to Prof Hacker and Prof Pierson he is \u201cfixated on helping the wealthiest Americans\u201d. The $1.5tn of tax cuts he made in his first term meant that, for the first time in history, billionaires paid a lower rate than the working class. The Republicans were always the party of big business, but Mr Trump is turning them into a playpen for oligarchs. This autumn, Mr Musk was the only boss of a Fortune 100 business to donate to the Republicans, compared with the 42 company heads who supported Mr Bush in 2004. Mr Trump\u2019s donors do not come from the big institutions of corporate America but are often drawn from casinos, crypto currency, fossil fuels and shadow banking. Business leaders used to argue that their support for politicians was in the hope of securing long-term stability and competent economic stewardship. This time, some appear to have been made very particular promises. In April, Mr Trump convened a dinner for fossil-fuel executives and lobbyists, where he reportedly demanded they donate $1bn. In return, they\u2019d face fewer pesky regulations on where they could drill. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole different class,\u201d one longtime handler of Republican donors told the New Yorker last month. Rather than a photo op and a grand dinner, \u201cthey want to essentially get their issues in the White House \u2026 They want someone to take their calls.\u201d And they probably don\u2019t want too much scrutiny. Mr Musk\u2019s appointment to the \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d is both less and more than it seems. It\u2019s not a Washington job that would burden the tech billionaire with regulations around conflicts of interest; rather he will \u201cprovide advice and guidance from outside of government\u201d. This sounds like unparalleled access without much responsibility, which leaves the American public reliant on Mr Trump\u2019s personal ethics to safeguard their democracy. What exactly does Earth\u2019s richest man see in the president-elect of the world\u2019s biggest superpower? It is a question that will keep coming around \u2013 not for Mr Musk alone, but for so many wealthy supporters of America\u2019s next leader.

      "bodyText": "Moscow has threatened to retaliate for the decision taken by the US and the UK to allow their long-range missiles to be used in strikes inside Russian territory, and warned that nothing is off the table. Earlier this week, the Kremlin announced a formal change in its nuclear doctrine which specifically envisages a possible nuclear response to Nato-assisted strikes on Russian soil. So, how far is Vladimir Putin prepared to go? How likely is it that Russia would use nuclear weapons in the Ukrainian conflict? The Kremlin has brandished its strategic arsenal before over the course of the Ukrainian conflict, in an attempt to deter western involvement. But for all the threats, the US has said it has seen no signs of unusual movement at Russian nuclear weapon storage sites, suggesting there has been no change in the physical positioning of tactical warheads.

We don\u2019t know if it can,\u201d he said on the Bluesky social media platform. What other ways can Russia hit back at the west? Moscow has shown a great deal of imagination in its use of hybrid tactics, taking place in the \u201cgrey zone\u201d between peace and war, against its enemies. It has weaponised the flow of people migrating to the west, directing them towards the Polish, Lithuanian and Finnish borders with the aim of causing those countries political difficulties. Russian military intelligence has also carried out assassinations in the UK, Germany, Spain, Austria, Turkey and elsewhere. It has planned sabotage attacks, allegedly including the use of incendiary devices found at DHL cargo hubs in Germany and the UK in July. Western intelligence services believe the attempted bomb attacks were dry runs for similar potential attacks on flights to North America. In the US and in Europe, Russian internet bots have amplified polarising issues, with the aim of loosening social cohesion, and strengthening the far right. Russia has also been accused of jamming GPS signals, particularly over the Baltic, disrupting the navigation of thousands of passenger planes.

Moscow has a record of forming temporary marriages of convenience with allies and proxies to carry out disruption operations in the west. According to a report in the Wall Street Journal last month, Russia has provided targeting data to Yemeni Houthi rebels for use in targeting western shipping in the Red Sea. In the UK, the head of MI5, the domestic security service, said in October that Russian intelligence had dramatically stepped up its collaboration with criminal gangs as part of \u201ca sustained mission to generate mayhem on British and European streets: we\u2019ve seen arson, sabotage and more\u201d.

Rayner\u2019s consultation proposes a further four changes to the scheme. Under her plans, tenants will have to live in a house for longer than three years to claim a discount; newly built social homes will be exempted from the scheme; authorities will have to build a home for everyone they sell; and councils will be allowed to reclaim the discounts if a buyer resells the property within 10 years \u2013 up from the current five-year limit.

A Republican won control of the state auditor race this fall for the first time in more than a decade.</p> <p>It also would give voters less time to request a mail-in ballot and to cure any issues with them once they are cast. North Carolinians currently have more than a week to fix any issues \u2013 like providing voter ID or proof of residence. The bill would shorten that period to two and a half days.</p> <p>\u201cThe bill is moving now because the people in control of the legislature don\u2019t like the results of the recent election in North Carolina,\u201d said Liz Barber, policy director of the North Carolina chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cIt\u2019s just a shameful power grab.\u201d</p> <p>The measure is expected to clear the GOP-controlled senate on Wednesday, and would then go to the governor, Roy Cooper, a Democrat who is expected to veto the measure. Republicans currently have a supermajority to override a gubernatorial veto, though it is unclear whether they will be able to in this case.</p> <p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t get much worse than what happened here yesterday,\u201d said Bob Phillips, the executive director of the North Carolina chapter of Common Cause, a watchdog group. \u201cA really bad bill rushed to the floor for a vote within an hour of it being posted online for public view. No time for public input or debate.\u201d</p> <p>Adrianne Spoto, a voting-rights legal fellow at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, a civil rights organization, said the bill contained \u201clots of last-minute changes\u201d that could be \u201ca real barrier for folks getting their votes counted properly\u201d.</p> <p>Republicans are advancing the bill after losing the gubernatorial election and being poised to lose a supermajority in the state legislature. The move also comes amid a recount in an extremely close state supreme court race; Democrat Allison Riggs narrowly leads Republican Jefferson Griffin <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25354948-s382-ccstc-8-v12\">by just more than 600 votes</a>. Riggs had trailed by 10,000 votes on election night but overtook Griffin as counties tallied provisional ballots and mail-in ballots that arrived on election day.</p> <p>The changes in the bill are \u201c100%\u201d a response to the state supreme court race, Phillips said. Had the new law been in place, counties would not have had as much time to count provisional ballots, and voters wouldn\u2019t have had as much time to cure their ballots.</p> <p>\u201cHad this been the law in place, Allison Riggs does not come out on top in her state supreme court justice seat,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He said he had also spoken to several election directors who said the condensed timeframe after the election would be impossible to administer and unfeasible to execute.</p> <p>Even though Democrats have done extremely well in statewide elections in North Carolina recently, Republicans have held on to significant majorities in the state legislature, aided in part by GOP-drawn legislative districts that have given them an electoral advantage. They have spent years trying to exert more control over the state board of elections.</p> <p>Last year, they enacted a measure that would have transformed the state board from five people to eight and given the state legislature the power to appoint members. It also would have transformed local election boards from being controlled by the governor\u2019s party to evenly split. That measure <a href=\"https://www.carolinajournal.com/unanimous-three-judge-panel-blocks-new-bipartisan-nc-elections-board/\">has been blocked by local courts</a>.</p> <p>The latest bill would also give Republicans more control over local election boards in the state\u2019s 100 counties. Currently, the state board appoints four members of each local board and the governor picks the chair. The new law would have the auditor-picked state board select local members and then have the auditor pick the local chairs.</p> <p>The bill would also curb some of the powers of the incoming attorney general, Jeff Jackson, also a Democrat. It prohibits the attorney general from taking any position \u201cthat is contrary to or inconsistent with the position of the General Assembly\u201d and prohibits him from participating in any litigation outside the state that could invalidate any North Carolina statute.</p> <p>In 2016, when Cooper was elected governor, Republicans also used a lame-duck special session to curb his powers.</p> <p>\u201cYou have folks who are upset about an outcome that they probably cannot change. Now they\u2019re going to change the rules to make sure \u2013 in their words, although they didn\u2019t say it publicly, but in their words \u2013 something like this never happens again,\u201d Phillips said.</p>",

The bill would strip the governor of the power to appoint members of the state board of elections, charged with overseeing voting in the state, and instead give that power to the state auditor. A Republican won control of the state auditor race this fall for the first time in more than a decade. It also would give voters less time to request a mail-in ballot and to cure any issues with them once they are cast. North Carolinians currently have more than a week to fix any issues \u2013 like providing voter ID or proof of residence. The bill would shorten that period to two and a half days. \u201cThe bill is moving now because the people in control of the legislature don\u2019t like the results of the recent election in North Carolina,\u201d said Liz Barber, policy director of the North Carolina chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cIt\u2019s just a shameful power grab.\u201d The measure is expected to clear the GOP-controlled senate on Wednesday, and would then go to the governor, Roy Cooper, a Democrat who is expected to veto the measure. Republicans currently have a supermajority to override a gubernatorial veto, though it is unclear whether they will be able to in this case. \u201cDoesn\u2019t get much worse than what happened here yesterday,\u201d said Bob Phillips, the executive director of the North Carolina chapter of Common Cause, a watchdog group. \u201cA really bad bill rushed to the floor for a vote within an hour of it being posted online for public view. No time for public input or debate.\u201d Adrianne Spoto, a voting-rights legal fellow at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, a civil rights organization, said the bill contained \u201clots of last-minute changes\u201d that could be \u201ca real barrier for folks getting their votes counted properly\u201d. Republicans are advancing the bill after losing the gubernatorial election and being poised to lose a supermajority in the state legislature. The move also comes amid a recount in an extremely close state supreme court race; Democrat Allison Riggs narrowly leads Republican Jefferson Griffin by just more than 600 votes. Riggs had trailed by 10,000 votes on election night but overtook Griffin as counties tallied provisional ballots and mail-in ballots that arrived on election day. The changes in the bill are \u201c100%\u201d a response to the state supreme court race, Phillips said. Had the new law been in place, counties would not have had as much time to count provisional ballots, and voters wouldn\u2019t have had as much time to cure their ballots. \u201cHad this been the law in place, Allison Riggs does not come out on top in her state supreme court justice seat,\u201d he said. He said he had also spoken to several election directors who said the condensed timeframe after the election would be impossible to administer and unfeasible to execute. Even though Democrats have done extremely well in statewide elections in North Carolina recently, Republicans have held on to significant majorities in the state legislature, aided in part by GOP-drawn legislative districts that have given them an electoral advantage. They have spent years trying to exert more control over the state board of elections. Last year, they enacted a measure that would have transformed the state board from five people to eight and given the state legislature the power to appoint members. It also would have transformed local election boards from being controlled by the governor\u2019s party to evenly split. That measure has been blocked by local courts. The latest bill would also give Republicans more control over local election boards in the state\u2019s 100 counties. Currently, the state board appoints four members of each local board and the governor picks the chair. The new law would have the auditor-picked state board select local members and then have the auditor pick the local chairs. The bill would also curb some of the powers of the incoming attorney general, Jeff Jackson, also a Democrat. It prohibits the attorney general from taking any position \u201cthat is contrary to or inconsistent with the position of the General Assembly\u201d and prohibits him from participating in any litigation outside the state that could invalidate any North Carolina statute. In 2016, when Cooper was elected governor, Republicans also used a lame-duck special session to curb his powers. \u201cYou have folks who are upset about an outcome that they probably cannot change. Now they\u2019re going to change the rules to make sure \u2013 in their words, although they didn\u2019t say it publicly, but in their words \u2013 something like this never happens again,\u201d Phillips said.",

Australia\u2019s government wants to host the summit in partnership with Pacific nations, which are among the countries most threatened by climate breakdown. Turkey is classed as a developing country under the UN system, and may gain the backing of several recent hosts in the same region. The question could be decided behind closed doors at the Cop, now reaching its final stages in Baku, Azerbaijan. The conference is scheduled to end on Friday but is likely to carry on into this weekend, as nations were still in disagreement on Wednesday night about how to channel funds to developing countries. Cop29 is supposed to produce a new global financial settlement on the climate, by which developed countries would ensure that poor countries have the money they need to cut their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt their infrastructure to cope with the impacts of extreme weather. At least $1tn a year is likely to be needed for this effort by 2030. Not all of that, but a substantial slice, should come from the rich countries that have historically been most responsible for carbon emissions. But they have so far refused to put firm promises of cash on the table, arguing that big emerging economies such as China and petrostates such as Saudi Arabia should also pay into the funds.

He said he was respectful of Turkey\u2019s bid but \u201cclarity would be good for everyone involved \u2013 us, Turkey and all the parties, particularly our Pacific colleagues, who are very excited about the opportunities.\u201d If successful, Turkey\u2019s bid would mean the Cop staying in the Middle Eastern/central Asian region for four out of five years: Cop27 in 2022 was in Egypt; Cop28 in 2023 was in the United Arab Emirates; Cop29 is in Azerbaijan and next year\u2019s will be in Brazil. Australia is understood to have the support of 23 out of 29 countries in a group made up mainly of western European nations among whom the 2026 summit will be held. But UN decision-making is a consensus process and Turkey has reasserted its bid in recent days. Bowen said: \u201cOf the 29 Cops, six have been held in the southern hemisphere, 23 in the northern hemisphere. It\u2019s time.\u201d Turkish media reported that the president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, had told the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, during a side meeting during the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro that his country would not withdraw its candidacy. Turkish officials have also been quoted saying it should be preferred in part because unlike Australia it was not a major fossil fuel exporter. The Australian push has been largely supported by Pacific leaders. The president of Palau, Surangel Whipps Jr, told Cop29 he \u201cvery much hoped\u201d the Australia-Pacific bid would be successful during the Baku summit. He urged \u201cthose involved in this decision to not deny the Pacific this rare opportunity to help host what is the most important international forum for our future\u201d.",

Although the club are clinging on to the hope the Spaniard can turn the situation around, belief in the manager is fading and there is a serious prospect of him being fired this month.</p> <p>It is understood much will depend on how West Ham fare when they visit Newcastle on Monday and host Arsenal on Saturday week. Defeats in those matches are likely to have serious ramifications for Lopetegui, who is under extreme pressure after a poor start. There is even the possibility of a heavy defeat by Newcastle forcing West Ham\u2019s hand.</p> <p>David Sullivan, West Ham\u2019s largest shareholder, has been reluctant to make mid-season firings. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/25/lopetegui-steidten-west-ham-count-cost-botched-revamp\">alarm over the performances</a> under Lopetegui is growing and it is understood talks have been held over making a change.</p> <p>West Ham, who are five points above the bottom three after winning three of their 11 games, are not thought to have decided on a preferred replacement for Lopetegui, who succeeded David Moyes last summer. They have looked at the former Borussia Dortmund manager Edin Terzic, and have made internal checks on former Denmark coach Kasper Hjulmand, former Benfica coach Roger Schmidt and Stuttgart\u2019s Sebastian Hoeness. The Guardian understands there are others coaches in the running. Long- and short-term appointments are being considered. Graham Potter, the former Chelsea manager, is available but West Ham have never seemed drawn to him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/18/west-ham-and-fulham-interested-in-january-move-for-citys-james-mcatee\">West Ham and Fulham interested in January move for City\u2019s James McAtee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The atmosphere at the London Stadium was muted when West Ham were held to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/09/west-ham-everton-premier-league-match-report#:~:text=Guardian%20Pick&amp;amp;text=A%20draw%20was%20probably%20fair,killer%20ball%2C%20but%20not%20quite.\">goalless draw by Everton</a> in their most recent game. Star players are not performing and questions have been raised over Lopetegui\u2019s tactics. The football has been drab, new players have not settled and there have been disciplinary issues. Disquiet over recruitment has also led to focus on the technical director, Tim Steidten. There have been reports that Steidten is cool on Lopetegui but it is understood the German was involved in the process that led to the 58-year-old\u2019s appointment.</p> <p>West Ham would prefer not to be pushed into sacking Lopetegui so soon. He is an experienced coach and has insisted that he will oversee an improvement given time. Lopetegui has previously managed Porto, Sevilla, Wolves, Spain and Real Madrid. He was available after leaving Wolves at the start of last season.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Julen Lopetegui is facing two make-or-break games at West Ham, who have used the international break to explore potential replacements. Although the club are clinging on to the hope the Spaniard can turn the situation around, belief in the manager is fading and there is a serious prospect of him being fired this month. It is understood much will depend on how West Ham fare when they visit Newcastle on Monday and host Arsenal on Saturday week. Defeats in those matches are likely to have serious ramifications for Lopetegui, who is under extreme pressure after a poor start. There is even the possibility of a heavy defeat by Newcastle forcing West Ham\u2019s hand. David Sullivan, West Ham\u2019s largest shareholder, has been reluctant to make mid-season firings. But alarm over the performances under Lopetegui is growing and it is understood talks have been held over making a change. West Ham, who are five points above the bottom three after winning three of their 11 games, are not thought to have decided on a preferred replacement for Lopetegui, who succeeded David Moyes last summer. They have looked at the former Borussia Dortmund manager Edin Terzic, and have made internal checks on former Denmark coach Kasper Hjulmand, former Benfica coach Roger Schmidt and Stuttgart\u2019s Sebastian Hoeness. The Guardian understands there are others coaches in the running. Long- and short-term appointments are being considered. Graham Potter, the former Chelsea manager, is available but West Ham have never seemed drawn to him. The atmosphere at the London Stadium was muted when West Ham were held to a goalless draw by Everton in their most recent game. Star players are not performing and questions have been raised over Lopetegui\u2019s tactics. The football has been drab, new players have not settled and there have been disciplinary issues. Disquiet over recruitment has also led to focus on the technical director, Tim Steidten. There have been reports that Steidten is cool on Lopetegui but it is understood the German was involved in the process that led to the 58-year-old\u2019s appointment. West Ham would prefer not to be pushed into sacking Lopetegui so soon. He is an experienced coach and has insisted that he will oversee an improvement given time. Lopetegui has previously managed Porto, Sevilla, Wolves, Spain and Real Madrid. He was available after leaving Wolves at the start of last season.",

No one in the XV has 50 caps, only two have more than 25. South Africa have more than 900 in their matchday squad. It was two years ago that Wales beat South Africa 13-12 in Bloemfontein, but things have fallen so far so fast that Gatland\u2019s pre-match chat turned into an exercise in expectation management. \u201cHopefully we go out and give a better performance than we did last week.\u201d Which made it sound as if it was all beyond his control. Perhaps the New Zealander is just too smart to put himself on the hook by promising things he cannot be sure he can deliver. Asked what the Welsh public should expect from the side on Saturday, he said: \u201cThe public want to see some passion and desire and for the players to go out there and show what it means to put the red shirt on. If they see that, I think they\u2019ll be happy.\u201d Winning, or even going close, did not come into it. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pretty clear in terms of the plan we\u2019ve had,\u201d Gatland said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a group of young players that need a bit of time. I\u2019m aware of the pressure and that decisions could be made that are outside my control. We\u2019ve just asked for a little bit of time. Whether we get that time, we\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d He has at least four days.",

There are also harm-reduction strategies people can employ in their daily lives.</p> <p>\u201cDigital security can feel really overwhelming because it feels like a lot of tasks to do,\u201d Lucal said. \u201cYou should assume tech companies, law enforcement agencies, immigration enforcement can access anything that you message, post, search, look at, watch online if they want to. But there are ways to make it a lot harder for them.\u201d</p> <p>The following tips are not exhaustive but are some of the high-priority recommendations Just Futures Law and other organizations have suggested if you\u2019re an asylum seeker or immigrant concerned about protecting your privacy. At a high level, you should be looking at minimizing how much data you\u2019re storing or sharing, be especially vigilant about which apps you\u2019re sharing your location with and deleting your data when possible.</p> <h2>Disappear your messages</h2> <p>Let\u2019s start with messaging. For a lot of the privacy concerns we\u2019ve addressed, be it ensuring your messages<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/15/x-ai-gmail-meta-privacy-settings\"> aren\u2019t being used to train AI</a> or protecting your children\u2019s photos, one of the most important strategies for protecting your privacy is to <em><strong>use encrypted messaging</strong></em>. It\u2019s one of the first steps in data minimization that Lucal suggests for immigrants.<strong> </strong>In the simplest terms, that means that messages can only be accessed by the sender and recipient. Not even the company that runs the messaging service can access your texts, which makes these messages extremely difficult for them to hand over to prying government agencies or third parties, including immigration enforcement authorities.</p> <p><em><strong>Signal:</strong></em><strong> </strong>Most experts recommend Signal because it\u2019s not only end-to-end encrypted but also run by a non-profit with fewer financial incentives to collect and share your data with third parties and the government. The other reason Signal works great is you can <em><strong>set your messages to automatically be deleted</strong></em> after a certain period of time, which Lucal highly recommends. You can do that for each individual chat or you can set up disappearing messages for all chats. To set up your messages to disappear in a specific chat, click into that conversation, tap the name of the person you\u2019re talking to and then click on \u201cdisappearing messages\u201d. You\u2019ll be asked to choose how long you want the messages to remain in the chat. To do this for all conversations, click on your profile picture in the top left corner of your app, click on settings, select \u201cprivacy\u201d and then click on \u201cdisappearing messages\u201d to choose how long you want messages to be visible.</p> <p>That said, it is understandably difficult to just start using a messaging service if all the people you\u2019re talking to don\u2019t also use that service. You do have other options.</p> <p><em><strong>Apple iMessage: </strong></em>This is also end-to-end encrypted when you\u2019re talking to other people with iPhones and if you have advanced data protection turned on. You can do that by going into your iPhone settings, tapping on your Apple ID profile at the top, tapping on iCloud and then scrolling down to the \u201cAdvanced Data Protection\u201d option and turning it on. This will ensure that all of the data that is backed up to your iCloud, including your messages, is end-to-end encrypted. But it also means that if you somehow lose access to your iCloud account, you will not be able to get that information back from the company because Apple does not have it on its servers.</p> <p><em><strong>WhatsApp</strong></em>: This platform is also end-to-end encrypted and has consistently been the most used messaging app in the world. Very few surveillance and privacy experts I\u2019ve spoken with recommend sharing any personal information on Meta-owned platforms like WhatsApp, however. The company has been known to <a href=\"https://faq.whatsapp.com/444002211197967\">share personal details</a> as well as people\u2019s posts and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/10/facebook-user-data-abortion-nebraska-police\">information about conversations</a> they have over its various messenger apps with law enforcement and government agencies.</p> <p>It is difficult to move all your conversations from a platform that everyone in the world seems to be using to one that people might need to download. Lucal suggests having discussions with people within your community about how to keep one another safe and perhaps slowly transitioning to a more secure platform.</p> <p>But if that is not currently an option, the same rules apply: use disappearing messages. This feature can be found in the settings of each WhatsApp chat which you can access by tapping on the name of the chat and then scrolling down to \u201cdisappearing messages\u201d. Or if you want to apply it across all new conversations you start, head over to the settings tab at the bottom right corner of the app. Click on \u201cprivacy\u201d and then click on \u201cdefault message timer\u201d and select the time period you want your message to stay visible.</p> <h2>Auto-delete your data</h2> <p>In addition to auto-deleting your messages, you should minimize how much data other apps and services are collecting about you and ensure that the data you do allow them to collect is being auto-deleted. The big one is Google, so allow us to make an example out of them.</p> <p>Google: the company collects your web activity, Google searches, Gmail information, YouTube searches and videos you\u2019ve watched, map activity and more. The company also regularly shares data with law enforcement, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/25/us-immigration-surveillance-google-twitter-meta-personal-data\">including Ice</a>. As we previously reported, tech firms including Google have given Ice some level of personal data even when the companies are not legally required to comply with the request because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/25/us-immigration-surveillance-google-twitter-meta-personal-data\">it is not court certified</a>. In one case I reported on, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-03-24/federal-agencies-subpoena-google-personal-information\">the company only gave the person whose data Ice sought a</a> week to figure out how to stop the company from handing over that data. Google also has handed over lists of all the devices that happen to be at a certain place at a certain time in response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/16/geofence-warrants-reverse-search-warrants-police-google\">broad location-based search warrants</a>, called geofence warrants.</p> <p>You can minimize how much data the company stores from your activity page at <a href=\"https://myactivity.google.com/\">myactivity.google.com</a>. Once you get there you\u2019ll get a peek into the depth and breadth of the data Google collects on you. Your \u201ctimeline\u201d, for instance, is a detailed chronology of all the locations the company tracked you. Fortunately, you can now turn at least some of that tracking off. First click on each setting: \u201cweb and app activity\u201d, \u201ctimeline\u201d and \u201cYouTube history\u201d. That will open up a page called \u201cactivity controls\u201d and you can turn off that tracking completely right at the top. If for some reason you don\u2019t want to turn it off, you can set it to auto-delete from that same page.</p> <h2>Turn off your location settings</h2> <p>Law enforcement is actively asking tech companies for location information or buying it. We\u2019ve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/24/fourth-amendment-battles-geofence-warrants-public-defenders-nacdl\">reported</a> on some of the ways police and immigration authorities are using geolocation information to do reverse warrant searches with which they try to come up with suspects by asking companies to give them a list of every phone that happened to be at a certain place at a certain time. This, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/16/geofence-warrants-reverse-search-warrants-police-google\">naturally, has swept many people up into investigations</a> into crimes they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/03/techscape-geofence-warrants\">have nothing to do with</a>.</p> <p>There\u2019s no surefire way to stop every tech company from tracking your location information. But there are ways to minimize how many companies have your location information and how often they track it.</p> <p><em><strong>Do a 15</strong></em><em><strong>-minute review of your location settings.</strong></em> On iPhones, you can go into your settings and search for \u201clocation services\u201d at the top. Then click on \u201clocation\u201d; that will bring you to the location services menu. There you\u2019ll see a list of all of your apps and what your location preferences are for each. You\u2019ll want to go through each of them and make sure your settings are set to \u201cnever\u201d for apps that don\u2019t need location data to function.</p> <p>On Android, go to your settings, then \u201csecurity and privacy\u201d, then \u201cprivacy controls\u201d, then \u201cpermission manager\u201d and select location.

The less secure option is to only allow the app to access your location while you\u2019re using the app. \u201cKeep in mind, oftentimes people have apps open even if they\u2019re not actively using them,\u201d Lucal said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two complaints have been filed in Algeria against the French-Algerian author Kamel Daoud, the winner of France\u2019s most prestigious literary award, and his wife, a therapist, alleging that they used a patient\u2019s life story as the basis for his prize-winning novel. The writer, the first Algerian novelist to be awarded the Prix Goncourt, won this year\u2019s prize for his novel Houris, a fictional account of a young woman who lost her voice when an Islamist cut her throat during the country\u2019s brutal 1992-2002 civil war. A survivor of the conflict between the Algerian government and Islamist groups \u2013 in which up to 200,000 people were killed and thousands more disappeared, or subjected to torture and sexual violence \u2013 has said the story uses her experience. Using a speech aid, Sa\u00e2da Arbane told Algerian TV that the story of Aube, the central character in Houris \u2013 which has not been published in Algeria \u2013 is hers, as she related it during treatment to the therapist who is now the novelist\u2019s wife. \u201cRight after the publication of the book, we filed two complaints against Kamel Daoud and his wife, Aicha Dehdouh, the psychiatrist who treated the victim,\u201d her lawyer Fatima Benbraham told Agence-France Presse on Wednesday. Both complaints, the first on behalf of a national organisation for victims of terrorism in Algeria and the second on behalf of Arbane, were filed with the court in Oran, where the author and his wife live in Algeria, Benbraham said. The lawyer said the cases alleged \u201cviolation of medical confidentiality \u2026 as well as the defamation of victims of terrorism and the violation of the law on national reconciliation\u201d, which bans publications regarding the period of the civil war. The law drastically restricts what can be said about the conflict and states that anyone using the \u201cwounds of the national tragedy\u201d to weaken the Algerian state can be punished by prison or a fine. The complaints were first lodged in August, Benbraham said, some time before Daoud won the Goncourt. \u201cWe did not want to talk about it, so it wouldn\u2019t be said that we wanted to disrupt the author\u2019s nomination for the prize,\u201d she said. Antoine Gallimard of the publishing house \u00c9ditions Gallimard has defended Daoud, who worked as a journalist and columnist in Algeria but now works in Paris for the French magazine Le Point, and his wife, saying they are the victims of orchestrated attacks. \u201cWhile Houris was inspired by the tragic events that occurred in Algeria during the civil war of the 1990s, its plot, its characters and its heroine are purely fictitious,\u201d Gallimard, who was told the publishing house could not participate in this month\u2019s Algiers book fair, said this week. \u201cSince his novel\u2019s publication, Kamel Daoud has been the target of violent and defamatory campaigns orchestrated by certain medias close to the regime, of whose nature everyone is aware,\u201d the publisher added. \u201cNow, after his book was banned and his publishers forbidden to attend the Algiers book fair, it\u2019s the turn of his wife, who has played no role whatsoever in the sourcing of Houris, to see her professional integrity attacked.\u201d Daoud told Le Monde in September that so little was taught about the violence of the 1990s in Algeria that his own teenage daughter had not at first believed that his book could be based on real events. Algeria\u2019s war of independence against France was well taught, he said, but the civil war had not been addressed. \u201cDuring the war of independence, violence was noble, we were defending ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 1992, we were killing among ourselves.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Alas, poor Olive! I knew him, Horatio. This should have been Oliver Dowden\u2019s day, his chance to shine. The half-hour when he stepped out of the shadows into glorious sunlight. When the Tory party put aside its differences with one another and cheered him unconditionally. Laughed at his jokes. No one had ever done that previously.</p> <p>Instead, Olive found himself consigned to the very back of the backbenches, where he could be found trying to engage Jeremy Wright \u2013 another outcast \u2013 in desultory conversation. They had both been the future once.</p> <p>Now they were tolerated at best. An embarrassing reminder of a failed <em>ancien r</em><em>\u00e9gime</em>. Imagine. Even Priti Patel and Mark Francois got frontbench jobs from Kemi. Westminster can be brutal. Up to a point. For men like Dowden there\u2019s always forgiveness close at hand. A well paid non-exec job. Better still, an offer of a peerage. Arise, Lord Dowden. Olive could probably live with that.</p> <p>We\u2019ve reached the point where it feels as if Keir Starmer is out of the country for prime minister\u2019s questions at least once a month. This week he has been in Rio, though not just for the G20. That had wrapped up in plenty of time for him to have made it back for PMQs. But why turn up jet-lagged to face some awkward questions on inflation, farmers and winter fuel payments when you could extend your stay for another half-day to catch a football match? Call it a perk of the job.</p> <p>So on Wednesday we were back to deputy PMQs. Angela Rayner v A N Other. Kemi Badenoch has not got round to appointing a deputy \u2013 best to keep everyone guessing. Instead, she has let it be known she will spread her largesse around. Let various members of her shadow cabinet take turns at the dispatch box, depending on her mood.</p> <p>First to be given an audition was Alex Who?, AKA the floppy-haired Alex Burghart to his friends and family. Though there are plenty of floppy-haired Tories to choose from. Telling you he\u2019s also the shadow chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster probably doesn\u2019t help you narrow it down. He could be anyone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/20/rural-mps-urge-government-to-reassure-farmers-over-new-tax-rates\">Rural MPs urge government to reassure farmers over new tax rates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Never mind. All you need to know is he absolutely aced it. Kemi could stop the Tories Haven\u2019t Got Talent show right now and give Alex the job in perpetuity. No party leader could have asked more of a stand-in. The stuff that dreams are made of. Because Alex was \u2013 how to put this gently? \u2013 a wee bit crap. And that\u2019s being kind. All of which was music to Kemi\u2019s ears. The last thing any leader feeling her way into the job and not that great at PMQs herself would want is a dispatch box natural taking her place for a session. Now she\u2019s found her man. Someone to make her look good when she\u2019s out of the building. Men like Alex are gold dust. Everyone could do with an Alex in their lives.</p> <p>Trying to guess how he prepared for his big day out is pointless. Never in his wildest dreams could Alex have aspired to such mediocrity. He was like a drama student cosplaying a Tory leader for an end of year sketch show. Just not as funny. You get the feeling that in his real life, Burghart is a relatively quiet, gentle man. An academic manque. Not so long ago he wrote a paper on the Mercian Polity 716 \u2013 918. The Cnut\u2019s guide. Whatever that was. A niche specialist subject even for Mastermind.</p> <p>But what we got at PMQs was an Alex who was almost unrecognisable. Shouty. Almost deranged. Have I mentioned shouty? Poor Alex. Used to addressing an audience of fewer than five, he appeared to have never previously encountered a microphone. Rather than addressing Rayner \u2013 or the speaker \u2013 face to face, he leaned forward, twisting his face to a few inches away from the mic and started bellowing, so loud that the mic went into meltdown. Popping and feedback. It was all rather unnerving.</p> <p>He began with what he imagined to be a killer one-liner. What was the government going to do about inflation? Only he soon found that Angela Rayner had handed him his arse on a plate, having pointed out that Burghart had been minister for growth in the Liz Truss government when inflation had been running at more than 11%. Alex never really recovered from that schoolboy error.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/20/uk-inflation-jump-dashes-hope-interest-rate-cut-december\">UK\u2019s inflation jump dashes hope of interest rate cut in December | Heather Stewart</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not that Rayner had things entirely her own way. There was no easy way to explain away that inflation had risen, was forecast to rise further and that the government wasn\u2019t necessarily able to do much about it. So she just kept prodding away at Burghart. Undermining him. She has a way of making posh boys feel very uncomfortable. Men seldom given to self-doubt suddenly find themselves unable to articulate a coherent sentence. Blush and bluster.</p> <p>Alex gave up on inflation and turned to the farmers. Here Labour is also in some trouble, because blanket name-calling them all as millionaires who deserve to pay up is not really working.</p> <p>Nor is the tactic of telling farmers they don\u2019t understand the economics of farming and that their accountants and financial advisers have been lying to them. It sounds arrogant. Out of touch. As if the farmers are too dim to work things out for themselves. Which is why they needed the Treasury to talk down to them in words of one syllable. Only this appears to be the current government policy: to carry on telling the farmers there\u2019s nothing for them to worry about until they run off into a corner and die. Rayner merely repeated this line. She didn\u2019t sound convincing. Not that she was too bothered. This was all above her pay grade. Luckily, she only had Burghart to deal with.</p> <p>The rest of PMQs passed peacefully enough, mainly with Labour MPs asking obsequious questions. Pointless. They need to find a voice. </p> <p>Graham Stuart tried to get a few digs in at Rachel Reeves for rewriting parts of her CV. Here I take the moral high ground. I\u2019ve never lied on a CV because I\u2019ve never had a job where one was required. I started writing in my 30s because it was the only job I could think of where a 10-year gap could go unexplained.

Instead, Olive found himself consigned to the very back of the backbenches, where he could be found trying to engage Jeremy Wright \u2013 another outcast \u2013 in desultory conversation. They had both been the future once. Now they were tolerated at best. An embarrassing reminder of a failed ancien r\u00e9gime. Imagine. Even Priti Patel and Mark Francois got frontbench jobs from Kemi. Westminster can be brutal. Up to a point. For men like Dowden there\u2019s always forgiveness close at hand. A well paid non-exec job. Better still, an offer of a peerage. Arise, Lord Dowden. Olive could probably live with that. We\u2019ve reached the point where it feels as if Keir Starmer is out of the country for prime minister\u2019s questions at least once a month. This week he has been in Rio, though not just for the G20. That had wrapped up in plenty of time for him to have made it back for PMQs. But why turn up jet-lagged to face some awkward questions on inflation, farmers and winter fuel payments when you could extend your stay for another half-day to catch a football match? Call it a perk of the job. So on Wednesday we were back to deputy PMQs. Angela Rayner v A N Other. Kemi Badenoch has not got round to appointing a deputy \u2013 best to keep everyone guessing. Instead, she has let it be known she will spread her largesse around. Let various members of her shadow cabinet take turns at the dispatch box, depending on her mood. First to be given an audition was Alex Who?, AKA the floppy-haired Alex Burghart to his friends and family. Though there are plenty of floppy-haired Tories to choose from. Telling you he\u2019s also the shadow chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster probably doesn\u2019t help you narrow it down. He could be anyone. Never mind. All you need to know is he absolutely aced it. Kemi could stop the Tories Haven\u2019t Got Talent show right now and give Alex the job in perpetuity. No party leader could have asked more of a stand-in. The stuff that dreams are made of. Because Alex was \u2013 how to put this gently? \u2013 a wee bit crap. And that\u2019s being kind. All of which was music to Kemi\u2019s ears. The last thing any leader feeling her way into the job and not that great at PMQs herself would want is a dispatch box natural taking her place for a session. Now she\u2019s found her man. Someone to make her look good when she\u2019s out of the building. Men like Alex are gold dust. Everyone could do with an Alex in their lives. Trying to guess how he prepared for his big day out is pointless. Never in his wildest dreams could Alex have aspired to such mediocrity. He was like a drama student cosplaying a Tory leader for an end of year sketch show. Just not as funny. You get the feeling that in his real life, Burghart is a relatively quiet, gentle man. An academic manque. Not so long ago he wrote a paper on the Mercian Polity 716 \u2013 918. The Cnut\u2019s guide. Whatever that was. A niche specialist subject even for Mastermind. But what we got at PMQs was an Alex who was almost unrecognisable. Shouty. Almost deranged. Have I mentioned shouty? Poor Alex. Used to addressing an audience of fewer than five, he appeared to have never previously encountered a microphone. Rather than addressing Rayner \u2013 or the speaker \u2013 face to face, he leaned forward, twisting his face to a few inches away from the mic and started bellowing, so loud that the mic went into meltdown. Popping and feedback. It was all rather unnerving. He began with what he imagined to be a killer one-liner. What was the government going to do about inflation? Only he soon found that Angela Rayner had handed him his arse on a plate, having pointed out that Burghart had been minister for growth in the Liz Truss government when inflation had been running at more than 11%. Alex never really recovered from that schoolboy error. Not that Rayner had things entirely her own way. There was no easy way to explain away that inflation had risen, was forecast to rise further and that the government wasn\u2019t necessarily able to do much about it. So she just kept prodding away at Burghart. Undermining him. She has a way of making posh boys feel very uncomfortable. Men seldom given to self-doubt suddenly find themselves unable to articulate a coherent sentence. Blush and bluster. Alex gave up on inflation and turned to the farmers. Here Labour is also in some trouble, because blanket name-calling them all as millionaires who deserve to pay up is not really working. Nor is the tactic of telling farmers they don\u2019t understand the economics of farming and that their accountants and financial advisers have been lying to them. It sounds arrogant. Out of touch. As if the farmers are too dim to work things out for themselves. Which is why they needed the Treasury to talk down to them in words of one syllable. Only this appears to be the current government policy: to carry on telling the farmers there\u2019s nothing for them to worry about until they run off into a corner and die. Rayner merely repeated this line. She didn\u2019t sound convincing. Not that she was too bothered. This was all above her pay grade. Luckily, she only had Burghart to deal with. The rest of PMQs passed peacefully enough, mainly with Labour MPs asking obsequious questions. Pointless. They need to find a voice. Graham Stuart tried to get a few digs in at Rachel Reeves for rewriting parts of her CV. Here I take the moral high ground. I\u2019ve never lied on a CV because I\u2019ve never had a job where one was required. I started writing in my 30s because it was the only job I could think of where a 10-year gap could go unexplained. Something for MPs to consider.

In a speech shortly after the conclusion of Hochstein\u2019s visit, Naim Qassem, Hezbollah\u2019s secretary general, said the group was working on \u201ctwo tracks, the field and the negotiations\u201d, and would not stop fighting until a ceasefire was signed. He said Hezbollah would not accept any truce that allowed Israel to enter Lebanon \u201cwhenever it wants\u201d. In the days leading up to Hochstein\u2019s visit, Israel escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking central Beirut three times in 24 hours after a break of more than a month. Hezbollah, in turn, launched missiles at Tel Aviv and attacked five military bases in Haifa. Initially, Hezbollah said that its purpose in attacking Israel was to force a ceasefire in Gaza \u2013 and refused to enter into negotiations before that was achieved. However, the killing of its senior leadership and thousands of its members, in addition to the continual progress Israeli forces have made in south Lebanon, has led the group to abandon a Gaza ceasefire as a prerequisite for negotiations. On Wednesday, Qassem said: \u201cOur second battle after the battle to support Gaza began two months ago \u2026 which is to repel the comprehensive aggression against Lebanon.\u201d As diplomatic efforts to end hostilities in Lebanon intensified, the US vetoed a UN security council vote on Wednesday demanding an \u201cimmediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire\u201d in Gaza because it did not explicitly link a truce to the release of hostages. Members of the council voted 14-1 in favour of the resolution, but it was not adopted owing to the US\u2019s stance, which as a permanent member of the council can veto resolutions. A US official told Reuters that the resolution had been \u201ccynically\u201d designed by Russia and China to provoke a US veto after new language the US said it would support was rejected. Negotiations aimed at a lasting ceasefire in Gaza and the release of approximately 100 Israeli hostages, who are still being held by Hamas after being captured in the group\u2019s attack on Israel last October, have repeatedly failed. Qatar announced earlier this month that it was quitting its mediation role until Israel and Hamas show \u201cwillingness and seriousness\u201d in the talks. Israeli forces killed at least 48 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, including a rescue worker, health officials said. An Israeli strike killed the rescue worker as the civil defence was responding to an airstrike in the Sabra area of Gaza City. Israeli also struck a school-turned shelter in the centre of Gaza, killing three and injuring 20. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strikes. Israel launched a new ground and aerial offensive on northern Gaza in early October that it said was necessary to tackle regrouped Hamas cells. Sweeping evacuation orders for the 400,000 people the UN estimated remained there, the blockage of aid and food deliveries and the targeting of civilian infrastructure such as hospitals have led rights groups to accuse Israel of the war crime of seeking to forcibly displace the remaining population. Israel has denied that it is systematically removing Palestinians from the area or using food as a weapon, both illegal under international law. Almost 44,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began 13 months ago, according to the health ministry in Gaza.",

And while the Human Tissue Authority strictly regulates the public display of human remains, with fines or imprisonment for breaches, it does not cover sales or purchases.

(He was shouting because in the chamber the background noise is so loud that rookie speakers feel they have to shout to be heard; the experienced ones know that the microphones will do the work for them.)</p> <p>On farmers, Rayner\u2019s comments did not go beyond anything said by ministers yesterday, and it still does not feel as if the governement is winning the argument with the farming sector. But Burghart\u2019s hyperbole was just playing to the base, and wasn\u2019t persuasive either.</p> <p>He was also one of several MPs to have a go at Rachel Reeves over<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/18/keir-starmer-china-xi-jinping-g20-ukraine-latest-live-news?page=with:block-673b42788f089bdc4e45b86c#block-673b42788f089bdc4e45b86c\"> her minor CV embellishment</a> (\u201cthis morning we had City economists, real economists, saying that next year inflation would hit 3%\u201d) but this just smacked of desperation.

In <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics-interview/2024/11/david-lammy-interview-donald-trump-doesnt-want-vladimir-putin-win\">an interview with the New Statesman</a>, <strong>David Lammy</strong> has argued that Trump would not go that far.</p> <p>That might sound like wishful thinking, but Lammy and Keir Starmer did have dinner with Trump in the autumn. Lammy discusses that too in the interview with George Eaton. Here are the key lines.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Lammy argued that Trump would not accept a deal over Ukraine that would look like a victory for Putin. </strong>Asked about Trump\u2019s stance on Ukraine, Lammy said:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve been a politician for 25 years and I understand the different philosophies at play. There\u2019s a deep philosophical underpinning to friends in the Republican party that I\u2019ve known for many years, thinking back to people like [former US secretary of state] Condoleezza Rice. Donald Trump has some continuity with this position, which is \u2018peace through strength\u2019.</p> <p>What I do know about Donald Trump is that he doesn\u2019t like losers and he doesn\u2019t want to lose; he wants to get the right deal for the American people. And he knows that the right deal for the American people is peace in Europe and that means a sustainable peace \u2013 not Russia achieving its aims and coming back for more in the years ahead.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>Lammy said he found Trump \u201cvery funny, very engaging and very charismatic\u201d when he and Starmer met Trump for dinner at his home in New York. </strong>He also said Trump was \u201ca consummate politician\u201d and very interested in learning how Labour won the election in the UK.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>Lammy said he was confident that the Trump administration would back the UK deal giving Mauritius sovereignty over the Chagos Islands. </strong>Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, has claimed Trump\u2019s team are strongly opposed to the deal. But Lammy said:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The most important thing about that deal was securing the [US-UK] naval base and securing that naval base well beyond any of our lifetimes [99 years]. That secures global security in many, many ways and it certainly keeps that important part of the Indian Ocean out of play for the Chinese.</p> <p>I\u2019m very confident that when the new administration looks at the detail of this deal that they will stand behind it because Donald Trump knows what a good deal looks like [a reference to his 1987 book <em>The Art of the Deal</em>] \u2013 and this is a good deal.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>Lammy said the Democrats should have focused more on the economy in their presidential campaign. </strong></p></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When I spoke to friends in the Democratic Party, and I raised this privately, I just felt that they hadn\u2019t centred the economy in the way that we [Labour] had done just coming into our own election cycle.</p> <p>It felt that the campaign was very focused on 6 January [the pro-Trump riot at the Capitol building in 2021], very focused on Donald Trump personally, very focused on abortion rights.

Keir Starmer is travelling back from the G20 summit in Brazil, but he won\u2019t be in the Commons in time for PMQs, and so Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, will be taking questions on his behalf. In line with recent practice, Kemi Badenoch, the new Conservative leader, won\u2019t go up against a deputy, and she will miss the session too. The Tories don\u2019t have a deputy leader, but Badenoch is getting Alex Burghart, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, to stand in for her.</p> <p>The PM might not be answering, but that does not mean the questions get any easier. The situation in Ukraine is looking increasingly perilous, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/20/uk-inflation-rises-delay-interest-rate-cut-price-rises\">inflation is going up</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/19/winter-fuel-payment-cuts-may-force-100000-pensioners-below-poverty-line\">figures out yesterday </a>have reignited the row about the government\u2019s decision to cut the winter fuel payment. But the Conservatives may also want to ask about farmers, and the plan to extend inheritance tax to some farms. Traditonally the Tories have liked to think of themselves as a pro-countryside, pro-farming party, and they will have been reassured by the fact that, when they lined up alongside farmers at yesterday\u2019s rally, they did not just have Jeremy Clarkson with them; the Liberal Democrats, the Green party, Greenpeace and even Just Stop Oil were on the farmers\u2019 side too.</p> <p>Now the Tories have combined backing the NFU with another deep-seated rightwing obsession \u2013 attacking the BBC. In comments that have provided the Daily Telegraph with its splash, <strong>Stuart Andrew</strong>, the shadow culture secretary, has attacked the BBC for producing a factcheck analysis saying that some of the claims made by the pro-farming lobby about the impact of the inheritance tax change are exaggerated. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The job of BBC Verify is to do exactly that but they\u2019ve failed on their own terms.</p> <p>The government is refusing to say how many family farms are <a href=\"https://archive.is/o/laZOi/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/tax/inheritance/how-farmers-dodge-labour-inheritance-tax-raid/\">subject to their tax raid</a>, only offering partial and out of date statistics which fail to account for the full scale of their reforms.</p> <p>The taxpayers pay for the BBC to be independent and free from bias, not for them to regurgitate Labour lines.</p> <p>This matter should be immediately looked into and corrected.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Telegraph story also makes much of Jeremy Clarkson, the TV celebrity and farmer, accusing the BBC of bias because a BBC reporter had the temerity to ask him at yesterday\u2019s rally about the fact that he bought a farm at least in part to dodge inheritance tax \u2013 something that he has been happy to boast about in the past.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1858992454659354715\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">DAILY TELEGRAPH: PM claims BBC has backed him over farm raid <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TomorrowsPapersToday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TomorrowsPapersToday</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/aEITwfRaUo\">pic.twitter.com/aEITwfRaUo</a></p>&mdash; Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1858992454659354715?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 19, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>Andrew\u2019s broadside against the BBC seems to have been inspired by this<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8rlk0d2vk2o\"> BBC Verify article</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/BenChu_/status/1858965077799694759\">this video </a>summary by Ben Chu, a BBC Verify correspondent, in which he said that claims from the Country Land and Business Association that 70,000 farms would be affected by the change was \u201calmost certainly an overestimate\u201d.

As it should; most reasonable commentators would agree these reports were fair, not biased.

Writing for the Guardian, Abbott and Leigh \u2013 the mother and father of the house \u2013 said there had been insufficient scrutiny of the law and urged parliament to instead focus on better health and care services. Cuts to the winter fuel allowance could force 100,000 pensioners in England and Wales into relative fuel poverty, government analysis has shown, as ministers come under mounting pressure over measures in last month\u2019s budget. Internal government modelling shows the decision to remove the benefit from millions of pensioners will push about 50,000 more people into relative poverty next year, and another 50,000 by the end of the decade. The defence secretary, John Healey, has denied claims that a cost-cutting scrapping of a series of British navy vessels has been a \u201cblack day\u201d for Britain\u2019s defence. Two former Royal Navy flagships, a frigate and two support tankers will be decommissioned as part of cost-saving measures, the Ministry of Defence has announced. The move was blamed on a \u201cdire inheritance\u201d left by the last administration, and the decision to scrap defence capability also includes a 14-year-old army drone. Rural Labour MPs have called on the government to reassure worried farmers, in an attempt to quell the escalating row over inheritance tax on agricultural property. Thousands of farmers and landowners descended on Whitehall on Tuesday to protest against the plans, which they said will cause family farms to have to sell up in order pay the new 20% rate on assets above a \u00a31m threshold. Britain\u2019s top counter-terrorism officer today criticised \u201cunhelpful\u201d commentators, such as Nigel Farage, who after the Southport attacks insinuated that a conspiracy was keeping the truth from the public. Assistant commissioner Matt Jukes said such critics knew police were limited by legal rules about what they can say during a live criminal investigation and he also said misinformation that fueled the riots was \u201cturbo charged\u201d from abroad, including by bot farms and some state-linked actors. Justin Welby will complete his official duties as archbishop of Canterbury by 6 January, the Feast of Epiphany, and will do little in the way of public engagements over the next few weeks, Lambeth Palace has announced. Welby resigned as archbishop last week after a damning report concluded he took insufficient action over one of the C of E\u2019s worst serial child abusers. No timetable for his departure was given at the time. Defence experts have expressed some reservations about the decision to decommission obsolete ships, helicopters and drones announced by John Healey today. Matthew Savill, military sciences director at the Royal United Services Institute defence think tank, said the cuts mainly affected equipment that was approaching retirement. And he said the Watchkeeper drones were \u201cprobably obsolete\u201d. Defence experts have expressed some reservations about the decision to decommission obsolete ships, helicopters and drones announced by John Healey today. (See 3.10pm.) Matthew Savill, military sciences director at the Royal United Services Institute defence think tank, said the cuts mainly affected equipment that was approaching retirement. And he said the Watchkeeper drones were \u201cprobably obsolete\u201d. He went on: But the fact that defence either can\u2019t crew them, or is prepared to cut them to make very modest savings over five years in the current international environment, is an indication of just how tight resources must be in the MoD right now. And Deborah Haynes, security and defence editor at Sky News, posted this on social media. How can the UK talk tough on defence while at the same time failing to ensure sufficient funding for the military to at the very least be able to mothball \u201coutdated\u201d warships, helicopters &amp; drones? A key lesson from Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine has been that old equipment brought out of deep storage is better than no kit. That\u2019s all from me for today. Tom Ambrose is now taking over. Justin Welby will complete his official duties as archbishop of Canterbury by 6 January, the Feast of Epiphany, and will do little in the way of public engagements over the next few weeks, Lambeth Palace has announced. Welby resigned as archbishop last week after a damning report concluded he took insufficient action over one of the C of E\u2019s worst serial child abusers. No timetable for his departure was given at the time. A statement from Lambeth Palace said Welby \u201cintends to complete his official duties by the upcoming Feast of Epiphany (6th January)\u201d. It added: \u201cArchbishop Justin intends very little public-facing activity between now and Epiphany, but plans to honour a small number of remaining commitments.\u201d The date on which Welby formally ceases to hold office will be agreed with the privy council, the statement said. From 6 January, the archbishop of Canterbury\u2019s official functions will be delegated to Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York, the number two in the C of E. This week, Cottrell told the Guardian that Welby\u2019s decision to quit was \u201chonourable\u201d. He said he did not expect to be a candidate for the role. Britain\u2019s top counter-terrorism officer today criticised \u201cunhelpful\u201d commentators, such as Nigel Farage, who after the Southport attacks insinuated that a conspiracy was keeping the truth from the public. Assistant commissioner Matt Jukes said such critics knew police were limited by legal rules about what they can say during a live criminal investigation and he also said misinformation that fueled the riots was \u201cturbo charged\u201d from abroad, including by bot farms and some state-linked actors. One post on X spreading information got 27m impressions, police said. Jukes was giving on update on the riots in late July and August, the worst across England since 2011. It followed the murder of three school girls in a Southport dance class which led to false information and lies about the case, spread at least in part by those on the extremist far right. Police revealed almost half of the 1,590 people arrested were aged under 35, almost all male and 17% were aged 17 or under. Police spent \u00a331.7m quelling the disorder and are racing to find the causes and how to respond better if there is any repeat. Juke said only a fraction of those arrested, some 6% or 99 people arrested, were for online posts, with the majority were detained for alleged violence. He said: I think there is a legend that has emerged that the thought police were out arresting hundreds and hundreds of people for having opinions. The reality is that hundreds and hundreds ... were arrested because of their suspected involvement in violence, disorder or criminal damage. Jukes said the majority of the disinformation came from the UK, as well as foreign state backed media, such as in Russia, and also from bot farms overseas \u201cturbocharging\u201d the spread of lies to sow division. He revealed counter-terrorism police tracked the online spread. We would see tremendous spikes around midnight as bots kicked in, and we would see amplification, automation, of that reach of those messages which were at times hateful, at times misinformation. Police in England and Wales follow strict contempt of courts after a suspect is arrested. Jukes said some commentators knew this yet claimed the truth was being hidden from the public as tensions rose: It is deeply unhelpful if people who know we cannot speak in fulsome terms, who know that the principal concern is delivering justice for victims, if they present that as conspiracy and cover-up. Asked if he was referring to Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, Jukes said: \u201cThere are many people who have gone down that path.\u201d The counter terror chief also said online platforms needed to do more. We absolutely need online platforms to show commitment to tackling misinformation \u2026 We do need responsible commentators. It is unhelpful when people, who I suspect fully well know what the constraints are on reporting during ongoing legal proceedings, point to limited disclosures or limits on what can be said as evidence of cover-up and conspiracy. Farage was widely criticised for comments he made at the time of the riots following the Southport killings, including a video he released suggesting the police were withholding information about the person responsible. The Local Government Association has welcomed Angela Rayner\u2019s plans to reform right to buy. In a statement, Adam Hug, the LGA\u2019s housing spokesperson and the Labour leader of Westminster city council, said: The LGA has long-called for reform to right to buy as the system in its current format does not work for local authorities and those most in need of social housing. Steps taken by government already this year to amend the scheme are positive, and the measures set out today in this consultation will help further in supporting the replacement of sold homes and to stem the continued loss of existing stock. Angela Rayner, the deputy PM and housing secretary, has announced a consultation on plans to restrict the right to buy. In a news release, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said that the proposals would make right to buy \u2013 the provision allowing council tenants to buy their home at a discount \u2013 \u201cfairer and more sustainable\u201d. The government is consulting on various proposals including: Cutting discounts available. Under the current rules, discounts can be worth as much as 70% of a property\u2019s value. The government is considering cutting the maximum discount to 20%. Increasing the minimum period someone has to have been a tenant to be eligible from 3 years, the current minimum, to 5 years, 10 years, or even longer. Excluding newly-build social housing from being eligble for right to buy. Replacing the current replacement targets with a like-for-like replacement target. Increasing the period during which councils have the right to ask for repayment of all or part of the discount received when a property is sold from 5 years to 10 years. Commenting on the proposals, Rayner said: For millions of people in the position I was once in, that first step into the secure social housing that changed my life has become a distant dream. Too many social homes have been sold off before they can be replaced, which has directly contributed to the worst housing crisis in living memory. We cannot fix the crisis without addressing this issue \u2013 it\u2019s like trying to fill a bath when the plug\u2019s not in. A fairer right to buy will help councils protect and increase their housing stock, while also keeping the pathway to home ownership there for those who otherwise might not have the opportunity to get on the housing ladder. In its news release, Rayner\u2019s department said that right to buy in its current form was creating a social housing crisis. It said: Fewer than 48,000 social homes have been built or acquired using Right to Buy receipts since 2012, despite over 124,000 council homes sold through the scheme across the same period. The housing crisis inherited by the government has seen the demand for social housing currently at an all-time high, with over 1.2 million people stuck on housing waiting lists as well as record numbers of households, including over 150,000 children, living in temporary accommodation. The full consultation document is here. James Cartlidge, the shadow defence secretary, accused the government of undermining national security with the defence cuts announced today. (See 3.10pm.) Responding to John Healey in the Commons, Cartlidge said: Whatever the chancellor\u2019s true grasp of economics, she\u2019s certainly been able to force her priorities onto the country, getting the MoD to scrap major capabilities before they\u2019ve undertaken the department\u2019s much vaunted strategic defence review. They\u2019ve killed off North Sea oil, undermining our energy security; this week they are killing off the family farm and threatening our food security. Today they\u2019re scrapping key defence capabilities and weakening our national security. Labour have made their choices; they own the consequences. Cartlidge also said that when he was a defence minister in the last government he was told that the former flagships HMS Bulwark and HMS Albion could have used in the event of a war. He said: I personally sought and received assurances from the Navy\u2019s leadership\u2026 that in the event of a full-scale war fighting scenario where the priority for the navy was littoral capability, those ships could have still been regenerated to a condition able to fight, and the crews found. Permanently scrapping the landing ships means we remove that capability entirely. Ukraine has fired UK-made Storm Shadow missiles into Russia for the first time since the beginning of the conflict, Dan Sabbagh and Andrew Roth report. Amy Sedghi has full coverage of this story on our Ukraine war live blog. Kemi Badenoch has put the finishing touches to her front bench team, and such are the depleted Conservative ranks that as a Tory MP, you had a better than one-in-two chance of getting a job. Including Badenoch herself, 64 Tories are shadow ministers or whips, which is just under 53% of the total of 121 Conservatives in the Commons. The full front bench list is longer, but some people are named as both whips and junior ministers in departments. There are no fewer than twenty whips, which at a ratio of one per six Tory MPs is not far short of a personal whipping service. We would not normally publish the full list of shadow frontbench appointments, but it does not seem to be available anywhere else online (and certainly not on the news section of the Conservative party\u2019s website, which has not been updated for more than a month) and so here it is, taken verbatim from the CCHQ news release.

In his Commons statement John Healey, the defence secretary, also announced new retention payments to encourage members of the armed forces to stay longer. He explained: I can announce today that I am introducing, from April, a new \u00a330,000 retention payment for a cohort of tri-service aircraft engineers who sign up for [an] additional three years of service. This will affect and be open to around 5,000 personnel in total. And from January, a new \u00a38,000 retention payment for army personnel who served four years, supporting 4,000 personnel each year for three years. So 12,000 troops in total. John Healey, the defence secretary, has told MPs that two Royal Navy flagships are included in a list of equipment being decomissioned to save up to \u00a3500m over five years. In a statement to MPs, he said that \u201coutdated military capabilities\u201d were being taken out of service. He told MPs: These decisions are set to save the MoD \u00a3150m over the next two years and up to \u00a3500m over five years, savings that will be retained in full in defence. As PA Media reports, Healey said he was decommissioning HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark which he described \u201clanding ships both effectively retired by previous ministers but superficially kept on the books at a cost of \u00a39m a year\u201d. He said he would retire HMS Northumberland \u201ca frigate with structural damage that makes her simply uneconomical to repair\u201d, 46 Watchkeeper Mark I uncrewed aircraft systems, and a 14-year-old army drone \u201cwhich technology has overtaken\u201d. He said 14 Chinook helicopters \u201csome over 35 years old [will be] accelerated out of service\u201d. And he said two wave-class tankers \u201cneither of which have been to sea for years\u201d were in the decommissioning process, along with 17 Puma helicopters \u201csome with over 50 years\u2019 flying [which] will not be extended\u201d. Healey said there would be no redundancies as a result of these decisions. He went on: These are common sense decisions which previous governments failed to take, decisions that will secure better value for money for the taxpayer and better outcomes for the military. Decisions which are all backed by the chiefs and taken in consultation with SDR [strategic defence review] reviewers. Allies have been informed, and we have constant dialogue with Nato. These will not be the last difficult decisions I will have to make to fix the defence inheritance that we were left with, but they will help get a grip of finances now, and they will give greater scope to renew our forces for the future as we look towards the strategic defence review and to 2.5% [of GDP spent on defence]. Instagram, Etsy and Gumtree users could exploit a legal loophole to buy and sell colonial-era human remains, MPs were told at PMQs. PA Media has filed this story based on what the question from Labour\u2019s Bell Ribeiro-Addy. (See 12.04pm.) PA says: Ribeiri-Addy told the Commons she had heard cases of body parts sold online and in auction houses, including a human thigh bone turned into a cane, a human jawbone necklace and the varnished skull of a six-year-old. The Labour MP for Clapham and Brixton Hill asked Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, whether the government would look at ending these sales, which she described as \u201cdepraved\u201d. Rayner agreed the practice was \u201cabhorrent\u201d and committed to meetings with ministers about \u201ctroubling cases\u201d. Opening PMQs, Ribeiro-Addy said: \u201cI recently met with members of the British Association for Biological Anthropology and Osteoarchaeology (BABAO) who highlighted a loophole in the Human Tissues Act which allows human remains to be auctioned, frequently disguised as modified items or replicas. \u201cThis is including a foetal skeleton posed under a glass dome, a human thigh bone turned into a cane, a human jawbone necklace and the varnished skull of a six-year-old, often from indigenous communities in Africa and Asia stolen during colonial expeditions.\u201d The Human Tissues Act 2004 features a ban on buying and selling human material, but there are some exceptions and suppliers can be reimbursed for expenses connected with transporting, preparing, preserving or storing remains. Ribeiro-Addy asked: \u201cDoes the deputy prime minister agree that it is abhorrent for human remains regardless of their origin or age to be sold by auction houses and on social media sites like Instagram, Facebook, eBay, Etsy and Gumtree? And will the government take action to end this depraved practice?\u201d Rayner replied: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely horrifying to hear the account of what [Ribeiro-Addy] mentions and I absolutely agree that that\u2019s abhorrent. And while the Human Tissue Authority strictly regulates the public display of human remains, with fines or imprisonment for breaches, it does not cover sales or purchases. However, I will ensure that a meeting is made with the appropriate minister to discuss the troubling cases that she raises.\u201d Britain\u2019s longest-serving MPs, Labour\u2019s Diane Abbott and the Conservative Sir Edward Leigh, have issued a joint call urging the Commons to reject the assisted dying bill, arguing it is being rushed through and puts vulnerable people at risk, Jessica Elgot and Pippa Crerar report. My colleague Peter Walker has posted this on Bluesky about PMQs. Starmer-era #PMQS are definitely more obsequious that the Tory ones \u2013 there is inevitably a mass of Labour backbenchers asking soft-soap, underarm questions about whether the PM/DPM agrees with them that the new government has done brilliantly on basically everything. Amazingly, they do agree. In her reply at PMQs to Daisy Cooper, the deputy Lib Dem leader, Angela Rayner claimed there has been \u201cscaremongering\u201d about Labour\u2019s plans to extend inheritance tax to cover some farms. Cooper asked: Somebody else who was very worried about the budget is Cathy. Cathy is a farmer in my constituency of St Albans, and she told me yesterday that she thinks the government changes simply do not make sense. The changes mean that her family may have to pay a bill which will force them to sell land, which makes food production unviable. At the same time, the government has not closed the land buying tax loophole that can be exploited by equity firms and the super wealthy. And Rayner replied: I\u2019m sorry to hear that Cathy is distressed by the \u2013 what I would say is scaremongering \u2013 around what the Labour party is doing. The budget delivered \u00a35bn for farming over the next two years, a record amount. The last government failed to spend \u00a3300 million on farmers, and our plan is sensible, fair and proportionate, and protects the smaller estate while fixing public services that they rely on. At a post-PMQs briefing, asked who Rayner was referring to when she talked about scaremongering, a No 10 spokesperson said: You have the deputy prime minister\u2019s own words. I think obviously the prime minister in his press conference yesterday recognises that there are concerns amongst farmers about the policy and that is why the government has a job to do to communicate the policy and our expectation, which is that the vast majority of farmers will be unaffected by the change. That was very missable. Alex Burghart, who was standing in for Kemi Badenoch, started well, with a very short, direct question, but after that it rapidly got worse. He used his first three questions to focus on inflation, trying to make an argument about Labour letting price rises get out of control, but inflation at 2.3% is hardly the Weimar Republic and Angela Rayner quite easily knocked him back with a reminder of his ministerial job title under Liz Truss and a reference to the inflation rate under the Tories. Burghart was on stronger ground talking about farmers, but at that point he started shouting furiously, conveying strong \u201cmadman on the bus\u201d vibes to anyone watching on TV. (He was shouting because in the chamber the background noise is so loud that rookie speakers feel they have to shout to be heard; the experienced ones know that the microphones will do the work for them.) On farmers, Rayner\u2019s comments did not go beyond anything said by ministers yesterday, and it still does not feel as if the governement is winning the argument with the farming sector. But Burghart\u2019s hyperbole was just playing to the base, and wasn\u2019t persuasive either. He was also one of several MPs to have a go at Rachel Reeves over her minor CV embellishment (\u201cthis morning we had City economists, real economists, saying that next year inflation would hit 3%\u201d) but this just smacked of desperation. Reeves is a real economist. At least, from Kemi Badenoch\u2019s point of view, Burghart did not upstage his party leader. For that reason alone, he might even get invited back. Helen Morgan (Lib Dem) asks about a constituent with cancer, whose diagnosis was delayed. When will diagnosis times improve? Rayner says people are waiting far too long. That is why the government is investing more in the NHS. Graham Stuart (Con) says in June a chief constable was sacked for misrepresenting her CV. And a nurse was jailed for something similar. Does Rayner agree that these punishments are right? Rayner says she knows where Stuart is going with this. She says the chancellor has shown more competence in the last four months than all four of her Tory predecessors. Paula Barker (Lab) says the Tories promised an employment rights bill, but never delivered. Does Rayner agree her employment rights bill is the biggest upgrade for workers in a generation? Rayner says she and Barker used to be Unison convenors. She says the government is delivering on its promise to make work pay. Lincoln Jupp (Con) asks about Spelthorne litterpickers, who do great work in his constituency. They have won an award for their service. Will Rayner congratulate them for what they do? Rayner says she agrees absolutely. Volunteers play a very important role, she says. Edward Leigh (Con) says it is red Wednesday, when people persecuted for their beliefs are remembered. Will the PM appoint a new envoy on religious belief, so the UK can defend religious belief minorities? Rayner says the government is committed to defending freedom of religious belief. She says envoy roles are still being considered. Yuan Yang (Lab) says thousands of families in her constituency have move into developments with unfair property charges. How will the leasehold reform bill address this? Rayner says the leasehold and freehold reform bill will being in more transparency over these charges. Jonathan Hinder (Lab) asks about neighbourhood policing. Rayner says the government wants to ensure every community gets a named local officer. Lewis Cocking (Con) asks Rayner if she will support efforts to get a banking hub for Broxbourne. Rayner says the government has committed to more banking hubs. Fred Thomas (Lab) asks how Plymouth will benefit from government investment in health. Rayner says every corner of the UK will see benefits. She offers Thomas a meeting with a minister to discuss Plymouth. Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster, says care providers in her constituency have said the national insurance increase poses a threat to them worse than Covid. Rayner says she values the work care providers do. Extra support has been put in place. She says tax benefts for charities are among the best in the world. And there is more support for the health sector, she says. Simon Opher (Lab) asks what the government will do to improve maternity services. Rayner says the Darzi report said the NHS was broken under the previous government. All mothers and babies should receive safe and compassionate care, she says. Saqib Bhatti (Con) asks why the government has declared war on farmers. Rayner says she does not accept that. Graham Stringer (Lab) asks Rayner to condemn the \u201cStasi-like interview\u201d given to Allison Pearson, the Telegraph columnist, by the police. Rayner says we should have a free press, but with that comes responsibility. UPDATE: Stringer said: Is [Rayner] as concerned as I am about the Stasi-like interview that was given to Allison Pearson, the Daily Telegraph journalist a week last Sunday, and does she agree with me that the Essex police force and other police forces would be better trying to deal with shoplifting, burglaries and other crimes, rather than intimidating journalists? And Rayner replied: It is incredibly important around free speech and our press, it\u2019s part of our democracy. But it\u2019s also, in direct response to his question, of course, police are independent and it\u2019s a live investigation and therefore it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for me to comment on that. But I do believe that we should have a free press. It\u2019s part of our democracy and we should have free speech, but with that comes responsibility of those that do it. Lee Anderson (Reform UK) asks if the government will throw the inheritance tax plans for farms in the bin. Rayner congratulates Anderson on the fact that, every time he moves party, he gets a promotion. He is now Reform UK\u2019s chief whip. Alex Baker (Lab) asks about support for teachers. Rayner says the budget for schools has gone up. And she says that, as MP for Aldershot, Baker will welcome the extra childcare support for members of the armed forces serving abroad. Daisy Cooper, the deputy Lib Dem leader, asks for an assurance that the social care sector will get help to cover the impact of the national insurance rise. Rayner says the government has allocated an extra \u00a3600m for the sector. Cooper asks about a farmer in her constituency who is worried about the inheritance tax extension. Farmers feel betrayed by the Conservatives, she says. But now they also feel they have been lied to by Labour. Rayner says the government\u2019s plan is \u201csensible, fair and proportionate\u201d. Andy McDonald (Lab) asks if the government will accept that Israel has carried out mass forced displacement in Gaza. And will the government accept its duty to stop genocide? Rayner says the government wants more aid to go into Gaza. And it is urging Israel to ensure Unrwa can carry on doing its work. And sanctions have been imposed in relation to settler violence, she says. Burghart says the government is just punishing people who did not vote for it. Rayner says Kemi Badenoch said last week she backed all the measures in the budget. But the Tories won\u2019t support the measures that pay for them, she says. Burghart says Rayner did not rule out further tax rises for farmers. He says they will come back for more. He says the money set aside for public sector pay rises is 20 times as much as what the government will raise from the inheritance tax increase. Why does the government not care about farmers? Rayner says it is an audacity for Burghart to take about broken promises. The Tories raised taxes to the highest level ever, she says. Burghart quotes the case of a farming family that thinks they will have to sell up because their inheritance tax bill will be too high. He says government figures are unreliable. And he asks for an assurance that there will be no further rises. Rayner says the vast majority of farmers will not be affected by the increase. Burghart says inflation is going up. It has delivered \u201chigh tax, high inflation, low growth, low reform\u201d. He goes on: \u201cThere\u2019s a word for that \u2013 it\u2019s Starmerism.\u201d He asks what the government is doing to help farmers. Rayner says the government is supporting farmers. The last government could not even get money out of the door for farmers, she says. UPDATE: Burghart said: It was Ukraine and Covid that drove up inflation. This government is doing it to the British people. High tax, high inflation, low growth, low reform, there\u2019s a word for that, it\u2019s Starmerism. Yesterday I spoke to farmers from across the United Kingdom. Some of them, families who have farmed their land for centuries. Elderly men in tears, children worried about their parents, all of them worried that their way of life is about to be destroyed. What would she like to say to them? And Rayner replied: We are absolutely committed to our British farmers and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve committed \u00a35bn to the farming budget over the next two years. That\u2019s the largest ever amount for sustainable food production in the UK. And it\u2019s alongside \u00a360m to support those affected by extreme wet weather, and over \u00a3200m to tackle disease outbreaks. His party couldn\u2019t even get the money out the door for farmers, failing to spend over \u00a3300m on farming budgets. The farmers know they ruined it for them and that\u2019s why we are in government and they are not. Burghart says the government is stoking inflation. He says it has given above-inflation pay rises to public sector workers, and the budget was inflationary. Rayner says inflation was at 11%, and it is now at 3%. UPDATE: Burghart said: First, we had above inflation pay rises for the unions. Then, we had a Budget, which the OBR said was going to push up inflation. This morning we had City economists, real economists, saying that next year inflation would hit 3%. Does [Rayner] agree that this government\u2019s decisions mean higher inflation for working people? And Rayner replied: I\u2019ll ask [Burghart], 11.1% or 3%? Alex Burghart says he agrees with Rayner\u2019s remarks on Ukraine. He gets on to his question, and it is a short one. What is the government doing to cut inflation. Rayner welcomes Burghart to his place, and points out that he was a growth minister under Liz Truss. This government is doing better, she says. Bell Ribeiro-Addy (Lab) asks if the government will stop auction houses being allowed to sell human remains. Rayner says this practice is \u201cabhorrent\u201d. She promises Ribeiro-Addy a meeting on this. Angela Rayner starts by saying Keir Starmer has been at the G20 summit. And she says this week marks 1,000 days since Vladimir Putin\u2019s barbaric war in Ukraine. The UK will stand with Ukraine \u201cfor as long as it takes\u201d. And she says it\u2019s equal pay day. With Keir Starmer still on his way back from the G20 summit in Brazil (they were on the ground refuelling at Cape Verde about two hours ago), Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, is standing in for him. Kemi Badenoch does not have a deputy, but today she has asked Alex Burghart, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, to lead for the opposition. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. Donald Trump\u2019s re-election as US president has prompted fears that he will cut off American support for Ukraine, forcing it into peace talks with Russia that would culminate in a settlement on terms favourable to Vladimir Putin. In an interview with the New Statesman, David Lammy has argued that Trump would not go that far. That might sound like wishful thinking, but Lammy and Keir Starmer did have dinner with Trump in the autumn. Lammy discusses that too in the interview with George Eaton. Here are the key lines. Lammy argued that Trump would not accept a deal over Ukraine that would look like a victory for Putin. Asked about Trump\u2019s stance on Ukraine, Lammy said: I\u2019ve been a politician for 25 years and I understand the different philosophies at play. There\u2019s a deep philosophical underpinning to friends in the Republican party that I\u2019ve known for many years, thinking back to people like [former US secretary of state] Condoleezza Rice. Donald Trump has some continuity with this position, which is \u2018peace through strength\u2019. What I do know about Donald Trump is that he doesn\u2019t like losers and he doesn\u2019t want to lose; he wants to get the right deal for the American people. And he knows that the right deal for the American people is peace in Europe and that means a sustainable peace \u2013 not Russia achieving its aims and coming back for more in the years ahead. Lammy said he found Trump \u201cvery funny, very engaging and very charismatic\u201d when he and Starmer met Trump for dinner at his home in New York. He also said Trump was \u201ca consummate politician\u201d and very interested in learning how Labour won the election in the UK. Lammy said he was confident that the Trump administration would back the UK deal giving Mauritius sovereignty over the Chagos Islands. Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, has claimed Trump\u2019s team are strongly opposed to the deal. But Lammy said: The most important thing about that deal was securing the [US-UK] naval base and securing that naval base well beyond any of our lifetimes [99 years]. That secures global security in many, many ways and it certainly keeps that important part of the Indian Ocean out of play for the Chinese. I\u2019m very confident that when the new administration looks at the detail of this deal that they will stand behind it because Donald Trump knows what a good deal looks like [a reference to his 1987 book The Art of the Deal] \u2013 and this is a good deal. Lammy said the Democrats should have focused more on the economy in their presidential campaign. When I spoke to friends in the Democratic Party, and I raised this privately, I just felt that they hadn\u2019t centred the economy in the way that we [Labour] had done just coming into our own election cycle. It felt that the campaign was very focused on 6 January [the pro-Trump riot at the Capitol building in 2021], very focused on Donald Trump personally, very focused on abortion rights. But my view is that you don\u2019t get permission to talk about those things unless you have satisfied the bread and butter \u2013 the economy and issues of immigration. A ban on social media for under-16s is \u201con the table\u201d if companies do not take action to protect children, Peter Kyle, the science secretary, has said. PA Media says: Kyle made the warning while telling Ofcom to be more assertive with tech firms, as both he and the regulator ready themselves for new legal powers in the Online Safety Act to commence from the start of 2025. The act will see new safety duties placed on social media platforms for the first time, requiring them to protect users, and in particular children, from harmful content. This will include a crackdown on under-13s having access to age-restricted content. Speaking to the Telegraph newspaper, Kyle suggested the UK would have to move to \u201canother level of regulation\u201d if tech companies do not get together to enforce the Act. He said he did not want to pursue further law changes until he sees how the Online Safety Act works. But he signalled he had been speaking to politicians from Australia where social media restrictions for under-16s have been considered. Asked if the UK could push its age limits up to 16, Kyle told the Telegraph: \u201cWhen it comes to keeping young people safe, everything is on the table.\u201d As the government prepares to enforce the Act, Kyle has published for the first time a statement of strategic priorities for watchdog Ofcom. This says Ofcom should ensure the concept of \u201csafety by design\u201d is being followed by platforms from the start so more harm is caught before it occurs, and pushes for more transparency from tech firms on what harms are occurring on their platforms. Kyle also announced ministers will launch a research project aimed at helping it understand the impact of smartphones and social media use on children. The British embassy in Ukraine remains open despite the US shutting its own mission in Kyiv because of a \u201cpotential significant air attack\u201d from Russia, the government has said. Frontline police are losing the confidence to use their full powers after lengthy prosecutions like the trial of the officer who shot Chris Kaba, Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary has said. Speaking at a policing conference in Westminster, Philp said that if the government did not act, the opposition would present plans to parliament itself. He said: Many officers I\u2019ve spoken to \u2026 feel their reasonable use of force or other police powers is treated disproportionately or unreasonably after the event, in a way that doesn\u2019t reflect and recognise the pressures of dealing with an incident or the split second decision making, which is inevitably required. Some incidents go into lengthy and bureaucratic Independent Office for Police Conduct investigations, or even prosecutions, where common sense says that is not appropriate. Martyn Blake was cleared of the murder of Kaba in three hours by a jury at the Old Bailey last month. Philp also cited the case of Pc Paul Fisher, who was cleared of dangerous driving after crashing on the way to a terrorist incident in Streatham, south east London. Philp said: We need police officers on the front line to be prepared to take the lawful action necessary to protect themselves and the public. We need them to drive quickly to the scene of an attack by terrorists and save lives. We need stop and search to be used to take knives off our streets, we need force to be used where necessary to detain suspects, and I\u2019m concerned that officers are losing the confidence to exercise those powers as required to keep the public safe. Philp said he wanted the government to allow officers to use the fact they were acting in line with their training as a defence to a criminal or misconduct charge. And he said he wanted this in legislation. If the government doesn\u2019t make those changes, then at the next opportunity, as the shadow home secretary, I will seek to introduce those measures as an amendment to the next piece of legislation that goes through parliament. Matthew Pennycook, the housing minister, has just started giving evidence to the Commons housing committee. The hearing is about the government\u2019s plan to build 1.5m new homes over the course of this parliament. Asked if this was deliverable, Pennycook said it was not just deliverable, but also \u201cessential\u201d. He said it was \u201can incredibly stretching target\u201d. But he said anything less would have been an inadequate response to the housing crisis. A generation of people were being priced out of home ownership, he said. He went on: We\u2019ve got millions of low to middle income households forced into insecure, unaffordable and far too often substandard private rented housing. We have 1.3 million people languishing on social housing waiting lists, and to our utter shame as a nation, more than 150,000 homeless children right now living in temporary accommodation. That is the price we\u2019ve paid for not being serious about house building rates. But Pennycook also said that building 1.5m homes over five years would be \u201cmore difficult\u201d than Labour expected when it set the target in opposition. He said the OBR was predicting a fall in housing supply. Good morning. Keir Starmer is travelling back from the G20 summit in Brazil, but he won\u2019t be in the Commons in time for PMQs, and so Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, will be taking questions on his behalf. In line with recent practice, Kemi Badenoch, the new Conservative leader, won\u2019t go up against a deputy, and she will miss the session too. The Tories don\u2019t have a deputy leader, but Badenoch is getting Alex Burghart, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, to stand in for her. The PM might not be answering, but that does not mean the questions get any easier. The situation in Ukraine is looking increasingly perilous, inflation is going up, and figures out yesterday have reignited the row about the government\u2019s decision to cut the winter fuel payment. But the Conservatives may also want to ask about farmers, and the plan to extend inheritance tax to some farms. Traditonally the Tories have liked to think of themselves as a pro-countryside, pro-farming party, and they will have been reassured by the fact that, when they lined up alongside farmers at yesterday\u2019s rally, they did not just have Jeremy Clarkson with them; the Liberal Democrats, the Green party, Greenpeace and even Just Stop Oil were on the farmers\u2019 side too. Now the Tories have combined backing the NFU with another deep-seated rightwing obsession \u2013 attacking the BBC. In comments that have provided the Daily Telegraph with its splash, Stuart Andrew, the shadow culture secretary, has attacked the BBC for producing a factcheck analysis saying that some of the claims made by the pro-farming lobby about the impact of the inheritance tax change are exaggerated. He said: The job of BBC Verify is to do exactly that but they\u2019ve failed on their own terms. The government is refusing to say how many family farms are subject to their tax raid, only offering partial and out of date statistics which fail to account for the full scale of their reforms. The taxpayers pay for the BBC to be independent and free from bias, not for them to regurgitate Labour lines. This matter should be immediately looked into and corrected. The Telegraph story also makes much of Jeremy Clarkson, the TV celebrity and farmer, accusing the BBC of bias because a BBC reporter had the temerity to ask him at yesterday\u2019s rally about the fact that he bought a farm at least in part to dodge inheritance tax \u2013 something that he has been happy to boast about in the past. Andrew\u2019s broadside against the BBC seems to have been inspired by this BBC Verify article and this video summary by Ben Chu, a BBC Verify correspondent, in which he said that claims from the Country Land and Business Association that 70,000 farms would be affected by the change was \u201calmost certainly an overestimate\u201d. Chu had sound grounds for saying this, for the reasons set out in a Treasury letter to the Commons Treasury committee, and the BBC is standing by its story. As it should; most reasonable commentators would agree these reports were fair, not biased. But the row illustrates how hard it can be for a governing party to win an argument when attacking media institutions trying to report impartially becomes part of the opposition\u2019s modus operandi. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, gives a speech to the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council\u2019s conference. 9.30am: Lord Darzi, the leading surgeon and former health minister, gives evidence to the Commons health committee about the report he wrote for the government on the state of the NHS. 10am: Matthew Pennycook, the housing minister, gives evidence to the Commons housing committee about the government\u2019s housebuilding plans. Noon: Angela Rayner, the deputy PM, faces Alex Burghart, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, at PMQs. 3.20pm: Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, gives evidence to the Commons women and equalities committee about non-consensual intimate image abuse.

      "body": "<p>Richard Flanagan had only just got home from a trek through the wilderness when \u201cthe phone started going off like a chainsaw revving\u201d. The day before, he had been standing in a grove of 1,000-year-old pencil pines, trees that he fears may not be around in a decade, such is the effect of the climate crisis on alpine heathland and rainforest in his native Tasmania, Australia. But now, on the other side of the world, his book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/02/question-7-by-richard-flanagan-book-review\">Question 7</a> had just been awarded the Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction, making him the first writer to win both this and the Booker, which he received in 2014 for The Narrow Road to the Deep North.</p> <p>Flanagan\u2019s prerecorded acceptance speech initially followed customary form, thanking the prize\u2019s judging panel, his fellow shortlisted writers and its sponsors, the investment management company that gives the award its name and which in recent times has become the focus of intense scrutiny over its ties to the fossil fuel industry. His soul would be troubled, Flanagan explained, if he did not draw attention to the devastating impact the climate crisis was having on his own country and to urge Baillie Gifford to meet with him and outline a plan for its withdrawal from any involvement in fossil fuels. Until that time, continued the 63-year-old, he would delay taking receipt of the \u00a350,000 prize money. \u201cAs each of us is guilty,\u201d he concluded, \u201ceach of us too bears a responsibility to act: a writer, a fund manager.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We live in an age that is under the illusion that the only path to truth is through numbers, but it\u2019s not so</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see Baillie Gifford as the enemy,\u201d Flanagan tells me as we talk over Zoom the morning after the awards ceremony. \u201cI think their support of literature has been well meant. It\u2019s an offer to come together and to remind each other of what\u2019s possible. I don\u2019t arrive at it from any position of moral superiority, because we\u2019re all complicit: I fly in planes, I drive a car, I live surrounded by plastic and I think these matters are extraordinarily complex. But I can\u2019t write a book such as Question 7, which in part deals with the catastrophe of climate, with the destruction and vanishing of the world I love, and not mention it and not act upon it.\u201d</p> <p>Question 7 is highly attuned to this weighing of responsibility and complicity. It takes its title from a Chekhov story that juxtaposes a mental arithmetic problem about train times with the unanswerable question: \u201cWho loves longer, a man or a woman?\u201d From this, Flanagan extrapolates a multistranded meditation on how we might ever arrive at a moral calculus, based on the experiences of his father, a prisoner-of-war in a Japanese slave labour camp who was nearing death when the US dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, ultimately liberating him to return home to Tasmania, marry and have children. How can the uncountable lives lost to the bomb be set against his father\u2019s \u2013 and, therefore, his own \u2013 existence?</p>    <p>The obvious answer is that these equations can\u2019t be made to make sense, but that continuing to ask, as Flanagan does in the book, \u201cWhy do we do what we do to each other?\u201d may bring us some form of understanding. His attempts to convey something of his father\u2019s experiences while working on the Death Railway, in what was then Burma, in The Narrow Road to the Deep North required Flanagan to fictionalise character, plot and trajectory, but Question 7 is a more direct representation of his own family.</p> <p>\u201cThis book is about my father and my mother,\u201d he says, \u201ctheir love for each other and the way they used love to find meaning in a world they knew to otherwise be meaningless. I think everyone is confronted at a certain point with the knowledge that the universe is empty of meaning. So the question is: how do we go on? They found meaning through kindness and goodness to each other and to others. They practised that love and they fought for that love for decades. It ceased to be what I thought was an illusion, and became their hard-fought-for reality. It became a truth \u2013 it was really a form of magic, and they the magicians. I realised it was an immense achievement. They came from very poor backgrounds: they understood the hardness and harshness of this life, yet they found wonder within it everywhere.\u201d</p>    <p>When his father returned from Japan after the end of the second world war, he took a train trip around Tasmania, travelling alone to the rainforest and to the beaches, in what Flanagan thinks was a way of re-grounding himself. In the book, he describes his father \u201ctouching his earth once more as if it were some sacrament necessary to live\u201d. Many did the same. \u201cAfter the book came out, I got letters from people who had stories about their uncles or grandfathers who did similar things, who had places that healed them. I think it\u2019s a human thing. I think the world has urbanised so quickly and dramatically over the last 30 years, we\u2019ve forgotten that there is a power in reminding ourselves that we live in a large universe, and it\u2019s not a frightening thing, but a reassuring thing. To be nothing is not to be terrified. It is to be at ease.\u201d</p> <p>It is, however, frightening when that world comes under existential threat. Flanagan weaves into Question 7 a portrait of the natural world based on his own observations and anxieties: of the swift parrots, now critically endangered with fewer than 500 remaining; of the fish that walk on their fins a couple of bays away from him, in existence since the time of the dinosaurs and now down to a population of 80. \u201cEvery time one of these things vanishes, something of us vanishes with it. There\u2019s an immense sadness about it, yet I didn\u2019t want to write a sad book. I wanted to write a hopeful book, because to me it\u2019s still a beautiful world and people are still good in it.\u201d</p>    <p>Despite being conscious of the horror of such figures \u2013 people killed, animals endangered \u2013 Flanagan is vehemently opposed to the contemporary obsession with quantifying the world around us. \u201cWe live in an age that is under this illusion that the only path to truth is through metrics, through numbers, but it\u2019s not so. We are the stories we tell about ourselves, we live within them and we\u2019re created by them. Equally, we can create liberating stories or oppressive ones. I just happen to think the story of numbers that is so powerful at the moment is a very bad and foolish one.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s required, he believes, is a reorientation of our moral direction. \u201cWe live in a world where, particularly with the technology we have now, it\u2019s too easy to take our compass from power and the despair it creates, whether it\u2019s in Ukraine or Gaza or with the corruption of those in high office. All these things are true, and all these things are terrible beyond imaginings, but we can take our compass from hope \u2013 and it is our friends, our families, plants, animals, the birds around us, the wind in our face. These are very small things: they can never amount to politics or an ideology or a religion. That\u2019s their strength and in that strength resides hope.\u201d</p> <p>Flanagan is mesmerised by the \u201cfourth tense\u201d used by the Yolngu Indigenous people of Australia\u2019s north-east Arnhem Land\u2013 a tense that suggests past, present and future happening simultaneously, affording an entirely different perspective on human actions and the environment we live in. That chimes too with a sense of his identity as a Tasmanian, as a person and a writer hitherto operating at the margins of a Eurocentric world and culture.</p> <p>\u201cWe were a colony of the empire, but after that we were a colony of the mind,\u201d Flanagan says, and he has found his own way to represent that in his novels and his genre-confounding nonfiction. \u201cI think you must write without hope or despair. When we ask, \u2018Can books do this? Can books do that?\u2019, it\u2019s not their job. It\u2019s just their job to not be boring, to honour whatever their subject is and to impel the reader to the end.\u201d Which, as the Baillie Gifford judges and numerous others can confirm, is a promise more than fulfilled by Question 7.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 November 2024. An earlier version incorrectly referred to Arnhem Land as being in Tasmania; it is in Australia\u2019s Northern Territory.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s decision to waive her anonymity and hold a public trial after her husband drugged her and invited dozens of men to rape her over a decade was made in the hope of ending rape culture and rape itself, her lawyers have argued. Summing up in court in Avignon, southern France, after more than two months of hearings, St\u00e9phane Babonneau, one of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s lawyers, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe rape is an inevitability. This is a country of progress \u2026 Rape is not part of the future of society that we want.\u201d Antoine Camus, another of her lawyers, said Gis\u00e8le Pelicot and her children hoped that making the trial public would lead to \u201ca change of mentality and a better future that ends this violence from another age\u201d. A total of 51 men are on trial over the rape of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, whose then husband, Dominique Pelicot, crushed sleeping tablets and anti-anxiety medication into her food and drink, inviting dozens of men to rape her while she was unconscious over a nine-year period from 2011 to 2020 in the village of Mazan in Provence. Dominique Pelicot has admitted the charges, telling the court: \u201cI am a rapist.\u201d Some of the men have admitted rape but many denied it, saying they did not know Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was drugged, despite video evidence showing her unconscious and snoring loudly. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, 72, a former logistics manager, has become a feminist hero after insisting that the trial be held in public to raise awareness of the drug-induced rape and abuse. \u201cIt\u2019s not for us to have shame, it\u2019s for them,\u201d she has said. On Wednesday Babonneau said Gis\u00e8le Pelicot \u201cdoes not regret for one second her decision\u201d to hold the trial in open court and force a public debate. He said: \u201cIn opening the doors to the courtroom, she didn\u2019t just want to show the crude reality of rape, but also the way in which in France in 2024, people still defend rape.\u201d He said it was unacceptable to hear the majority of men in court admit, when confronted with video evidence, that sexual acts took place but deny they constituted rape. Many of the accused have said they did it by accident, involuntarily, unintentionally or because her husband had said it was fine. He said the argument of many men that they had \u201cmade a mistake\u201d in raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot while she was unconscious in her bed \u201cputs the whole of society in danger because it risks more cases like this\u201d. Babonneau said that Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s situation \u2013 for which she has won support all over the world and is applauded by crowds upon arrival to court every day \u2013 was exceptional. \u201cNot all rape victims are lucky enough to be applauded every morning and emerge from court to a guard of honour by supporters encouraging them back in the next day,\u201d he said. \u201cThat situation usually does not exist. Most go through this alone, shut in the courtroom with their rapist.\u201d He said the Pelicot courtroom hearings were a kind of \u201claboratory\u201d that would lead society to reflect on rape. Camus said there must be a rethink of how defence in rape cases works, saying the trial had shown \u201cthat in a rape case in France in 2024 there is still discussion of whether you\u2019re a good victim \u2013 as if there was such a thing as a good or bad victim of rape\u201d. Camus said: \u201cThose defence strategies no longer have a place in court in France in the 21st century. \u201cHow in France, in 2024, can a woman still be subjected to what was inflicted on Gis\u00e8le Pelicot for at least 10 years? How in France can we find at least 50 men \u2013 but in reality it was around 70 men [some of whom were never identified by police] \u2013 within a 50km [31-mile] radius, to come and, without even talking to her, sexually abuse this inert body that appeared dead?\u201d Next week, public prosecutors will recommend sentences.

This happened earlier with Chris Bowen, Australia\u2019s climate change minister, and he revealed the kinds of climate finance figures being talked about in the closed rooms, though countries proposing them are not named. Bowen, and Egypt\u2019s environment minister Yasmine Fouad, have been appointed by the Azerbaijani presidency to facilitate the all-important finance negotiations.</p> <p><em>\u201cI heard from developing countries a requirement of $1.3tn trillion of finance mobilised,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cBut we heard different proposals for the split between the provided element [grants] and the element which would be mobilised [loans and private investment].\u201d</em></p> <p><em>\u201cFor example, we\u2019ve heard three different proposals for the provided quantum of $900bn, $600bn and $440bn.

The \u201clinkages\u201d mean that the money would be tied to agreements on countries not currently required to provide finance formally chipping in, such as China and Saudi Arabia, and private investment being included.</p> <p><em>\u201cWe heard from some groups that allocations are very important, but others expressed the view that they could not accept allocations because of concerns with regional balance,\u201d Bowen said. </em></p> <p>That is likely to be the Least Developed Countries group, of 45 nations, which is calling for $220bn a year to be specifically allocated to them, while the small island state group, Aosis, which is calling for $39bn.</p> <p>Tasneem Essop, from Climate Action Network International, said:\u201cDeveloped countries are insisting that the issue of the expansion of the contributor base and the role of the private sector must be decided before they put an amount forward.

The needs of Chad bear little resemblance to those of India. <a href=\"https://climateanalytics.org/comment/the-iea-just-published-its-2024-world-energy-outlook-what-does-it-say\">Most of the climate finance available today goes to relatively well-off developing countries</a> with booming economies \u2013 middle-income countries take the lion\u2019s share of the $100bn goal, at about 57%, between 2016 and 2020. Of the remaining 43%, Small Island Developing States (SIDs) received just 2%, Least Developed Countries (LDCs) received 17%; and other Low-Income Countries (LICs) received 8%.</p> <p>So if there was some way to ensure that the poorest and most vulnerable countries could receive a greater share of the publicly funded climate finance \u2013 and particularly that portion of it that comes in the form of grants, rather than loans, to stop them drowning further in debt \u2013 then that would be a good outcome for the poorest. (Some of the richer developing countries would be unhappy about what they would see as losing out \u2013 India, for instance, argues it will not be able to accelerate its transition to clean energy without external assistance.)</p> <p>Some NGOs are adamant that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2024/nov/11/finding-one-trillion-dollars-at-cop29-podcast\">private finance should not play a role in the NCQG</a>, but few developing countries think they will see $1 trillion agreed without a sizeable role for the private sector.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the GFANZ group of private investors wrote to the UN to say: \u201cprivate finance firmly believes it is possible to mobilise the $1 trillion of private capital needed a year for climate action in EMDEs [emerging market and developing economies] by 2030, given the compelling business case for the transition. The NCQG can be a critical lever to make this happen.\u201d</p> <p>GFANZ has had a troubled history since its launch with fanfare at Glasgow \u2013 some members <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/15/banks-agreeing-climate-pledge-gfanz-accused-of-exploiting-loopholes-greenwashing\">just will not stop investing in fossil fuels</a>, alongside their green lending \u2013 but the signal of private companies being willing to invest is important.</p> <p>Would private finance be so bad? Well, twenty years ago most of the developing world struggled with telecommunications. Landlines were limited and expensive; mobile phone coverage was often non-existent. Today, mobile phone coverage is booming in almost all countries. There are few places in the world where it is impossible to use them.</p> <p>That was achieved almost entirely by private sector investment. Governments helped by providing regulation and access to the radio spectrum, but it was private sector cash that set up the markets and continues to make money. Few people complain about this \u2013 they just use the phones.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-673dddbd8f082515be94ee09\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-20T14:06:03.101Z\">2.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The highly-polluting fashion industry is not top of the priority list in Baku but one social media account has been diligently <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/streetstylecop/\">documenting</a> conversations about climate, culture and clothes.</p> <p>They include a jacket made out of factory waste, saris that stand for decolonisation, bazin and wax prints that symbolise African unity, and a kilt from the Scottish highlands that keep people \u201cgrounded to nature.\u201d</p> <p>Julia Bush, a communications consultant who set up the account at last year\u2019s Cop in Dubai, said she initially did so as a way to stay \u201cupbeat and positive during the marathon of long days and climate doom\u201d.

(Although don\u2019t forget that the emissions of some large emerging economies are now so vast that they rival developed countries \u2013 China\u2019s historic emissions are now greater than those of the EU.) This sum is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/sep/24/rich-countries-could-raise-5tn-of-climate-finance-a-year-study-says\">achievable,</a> through taxes on fossil fuels and high-carbon activities, NGOs say.</p> <p><strong>$3tn</strong> \u2013 the amount, roughly, likely to be spent on energy this year globally, according to the International Energy Agency. Of which two-thirds will be on clean energy, the remainder stubbornly still flowing to fossil fuels.</p> <p><strong>$2.4tn a year</strong> \u2013 the amount developing countries (excluding China) need to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions, in line with the 1.5C goal of the Paris agreement, and adapt to the impacts of extreme weather, according to the International High Level Expert Group on climate finance, made up of senior global economists, led by Lord Stern, Vera Songwe and Amar Bhattacharya.</p> <p><strong>$1tn a year by 2030, $1.3tn a year by 2035</strong> \u2013 the slice of the above $2.4tn that should be met by external finance. The remainder can come and is already coming from developing countries\u2019 own domestic budgets.</p> <p><strong>$1tn to $1.4tn a year</strong> \u2013 the amount developing countries are demanding in climate finance from the developed world at Cop29.</p> <p><strong>$900bn a year</strong> \u2013 the amount that the Least Developed Countries and some other poor countries want to come in the form of public finance, preferably all or most of it in the form of grants rather than loans.</p> <p><strong>$300bn</strong> \u2013 the amount developed countries are likely to offer in public finance to the developing world.</p> <p><strong>$100bn</strong> \u2013 the amount of climate finance from public sources flowing from the developed to the developing world today.</p> <p>There is a big gap between $300bn and $1tn. But, according to the IHLEG, this gap can be filled in various ways. They suggest that $500bn in climate finance should come from the private sector, which is willing to invest in renewable energy, electric vehicles and other low-carbon technologies.</p> <p>According to IHLEG, about $80bn to $100bn a year should come from bilateral finance \u2013 that is, money going directly from developed to developing countries. That would be roughly double the current amount. An additional $250bn should come from development banks, including the World Bank. That\u2019s a stretch compared with the $120bn that the World Bank has just agreed to provide by 2030, which itself was a doubling on the previous amount (long derided as too small by developing countries).</p> <p>The remainder could come from a mixture of South-South funding; innovative forms of finance, also known as global solidarity levies \u2013 that is, levies such as a wealth tax, a charge on fossil fuels, a frequent flyer levy and similar measures; arcane forms of finance such as the International Monetary Fund\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/10/rishi-sunak-to-save-billions-by-counting-imf-cash-as-aid-for-poor\">special drawing rights</a>; carbon trading; and philanthropy.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-20T13:31:25.777Z\">at 1.31pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-673dd2938f082515be94eda8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/damiancarrington\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-20T12:48:46.635Z\">12.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">'We\u2019re reaching a point of real emotion here,' say campaigners</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re reaching a point of real emotion here \u2013 these talks aren\u2019t just about technicalities and figures on paper, they\u2019re about people\u2019s lives,\u201d says Danni Taaffe, from Climate Action International.

She said that number was backed by an in-depth assessment of needs. \u201cWe have had numbers flying around [<a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/developing-countries-eu-climate-funding-aid-cop29-africa/\">from the EU</a>] of $200bn, $300bn. What are those number based upon? They are a joke.\u201d</p> <p>Another red line is that the finance has to be from public sources and given as grants, Achoki said: \u201cA lot of African countries are in debt already, from climate loans and other issues.\u201d</p> <p>There is a major row about which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/19/china-india-developing-countries-cop29-climate-talks\">nations should contribute to climate finance</a>: the rich nations alone or those classed as developing nations in early climate treaties in the 1990s but which are now emerging economies, such as China and Saudi Arabia? Achoki said this row was being used to distract from agreeing on the $1tn. \u201cThese theatrics should not play any role \u2013 they are just strategies to derail the process.\u201d</p> <p>Safa\u2019 Al Jayoussi, from Oxfam International, said: \u201cI\u2019m a Palestinian woman fighting two battles today, the battle of climate finance and the battle to ensure that my family, my friends and colleagues are alive and safe. Instead of investing in life-saving aid and climate actions, countries are spending dollars on weapons that fuel wars. Those dollars are stolen from climate action and stolen from fighting inequality, poverty and hunger.\u201d</p>    <p>She said the ultimate finance target was $5tn a year from rich countries. \u201cThe richest countries are responsible for <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(20)30196-0/fulltext\">92% of excess emissions</a> and built their wealth from colonialism, neo-colonialism and exploitation of nature and people. It\u2019s not charity that we are asking for.

We know that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/08/cop29-climate-talks-what-would-a-good-outcome-look-like\">needs of developing countries are at least $1tn a year</a>, but there is little agreement on how that should be achieved and how it can be broken down.</p> <p>Today Cop29 is essentially stuck \u2013 delegations are waiting for a new text on the climate finance settlement, known as the NCQG (new collective quantified goal). That text is not now expected until the early hours of Thursday morning.</p> <p>Of that $1tn, only some is expected to come from developed countries. Just how much is a matter of keen discussion.</p> <p>Developed countries have told the Guardian they cannot put any numbers on the table until a new clean text has been delivered that makes clear the structure of the NCQG \u2013 that is, the division between publicly provided finance from developed country taxpayers, finance provided indirectly, the timeframe for providing finance and terms on who should be expected to contribute.</p> <p>There have been rumours that the EU was poised to put $200bn to $300bn on the table \u2013 those figures are indeed in line with the EU has been talking about, as have other developed countries, to the Guardian\u2019s knowledge. But the EU and other developed and developing countries have told the Guardian that no actual move has yet been made within the negotiating rooms to discuss such a number.</p> <p>A real sticking point is over how countries still classed as developing but which have large and growing economies, and high greenhouse gas emissions, should be treated. Rich countries want such nations \u2013 China is the obvious one but countries like South Korea, and petro states such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are also included \u2013 to start contributing to climate finance.</p> <p>Under the Paris agreement of 2015, only countries classed as developed when its parent treaty, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, was signed in 1992 are legally obliged to contribute to climate finance. China and other developing countries want to preserve this distinction.</p> <p>But there may be some compromise possible on this \u2013 China already provides billions every year to the Global South, though much of it is in the form of loans. The EU and other developed countries want China to give more details of this spending, but they are not demanding a reclassification of China as a developed country.</p> <p>Over the next few days, if the impasse is to be broken, some developed countries will need to put forward actual figures on what they think their contribution to the NCQG could be. This is hard \u2013 Cop29 is not a pledging conference so no country will be expected to say what they intend to spend individually on climate finance in the future. This is a collective goal \u2013 but the developed countries do not negotiate as a bloc, so no one among them can take responsibility for speaking for all.</p> <p>In normal times, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/10/whos-who-at-cop29-the-world-leaders-and-others-who-will-attend\">the US might have been expected to take a lead</a> \u2013 perhaps alongside China, as the G2 pair have done in previous Cop talks.

Milei - one of the most prolific world leaders on X - has been reposting memes hinting that he was minded to block the mention of climate change in G20 declarations but ultimately did not. </p> <p>Last week\u2019s decision to remove its representatives has started to have consequences for delegates from civil society who sometimes get their accreditation from their home countries. </p> <p>Tais Gadea Lara, a climate reporter from Argentina, posted photos on <a href=\"https://x.com/TaisGadeaLara/status/1858903300550099310\">social media</a> of civil society representatives who had their access cancelled due to Argentina\u2019s withdrawal from Cop29. Other delegations are helping them out, she reports, but it is a reminder of the vast network of people that come to these summits all working towards the same thing. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-20T10:48:31.245Z\">at 10.48am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-673d75838f08575854391788\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-20T06:35:36.242Z\">6.35am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re winding up the Cop liveblog for today. There was little in the way of concrete action but that is to be expected as the summit moves into its final stages, where torturous negotiations take priority over flashy announcements. The main events today: Argentina\u2019s foreign minister said the country will stay in the Paris agreement, after negotiators representing the government of climate science denier Javier Milei were ordered to withdraw last week. The head of OPEC echoed the Azerbaijani President\u2019s comments in praise of oil and gas \u2013 \u201cThey are indeed a gift of God.\u201d The Maldives urged countries to keep pushing for 1.5C even as some experts dismissed the target \u2013 \u201cWe must, must try.\u201d Money is the key question at this Cop, but no country has so far put any on the table, my colleague Fiona Harvey explained in a breakdown of what\u2019s at stake. Developing countries responded with ridicule to a climate finance target in the $200-300bn range that had reportedly been proposed by the EU \u2013 \u201cIs that a joke?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re reaching a point of real emotion here,\u201d campaigners warned. Those are the key points from today. We\u2019ll be back with you tomorrow morning for another day of live coverage as the negotiations heat up. $1.3tn, $900bn, $600bn, $440bn, $100bn \u2013 pick a number The negotiations at Cop29 largely take place in private. But the ministers charged with pushing progress do make occasional short reports in public. This happened earlier with Chris Bowen, Australia\u2019s climate change minister, and he revealed the kinds of climate finance figures being talked about in the closed rooms, though countries proposing them are not named. Bowen, and Egypt\u2019s environment minister Yasmine Fouad, have been appointed by the Azerbaijani presidency to facilitate the all-important finance negotiations. \u201cI heard from developing countries a requirement of $1.3tn trillion of finance mobilised,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cBut we heard different proposals for the split between the provided element [grants] and the element which would be mobilised [loans and private investment].\u201d \u201cFor example, we\u2019ve heard three different proposals for the provided quantum of $900bn, $600bn and $440bn. Others have mentioned a floor of $100 billion, with linkages to the contributor base resolution, as well as sources and structure.\u201d To unpack that, the higher numbers will have been proposed by the developing nations and the lower one from a developed one. The \u201clinkages\u201d mean that the money would be tied to agreements on countries not currently required to provide finance formally chipping in, such as China and Saudi Arabia, and private investment being included. \u201cWe heard from some groups that allocations are very important, but others expressed the view that they could not accept allocations because of concerns with regional balance,\u201d Bowen said. That is likely to be the Least Developed Countries group, of 45 nations, which is calling for $220bn a year to be specifically allocated to them, while the small island state group, Aosis, which is calling for $39bn. Tasneem Essop, from Climate Action Network International, said:\u201cDeveloped countries are insisting that the issue of the expansion of the contributor base and the role of the private sector must be decided before they put an amount forward. This is an attempt to distract us. \u201cThe Paris Agreement is clear,\u201d she said \u201cIt is the developed countries\u2018 responsibility to provide developing countries the climate finance needed to address the climate crisis and they need to pay up.\u201d She called the $200bn-$300bn figure for public finance the EU is reported to have proposed informally \u201cpathetic\u201d. Mohamed Adow, from Power Shift Africa, said: \u201cThis is a climate \u2018Cop\u2019 and we\u2019re dealing with a climate crime. But those responsible are trying to wriggle their way out. It\u2019s important for developing countries to maintain solidarity and demand in unison that the global north polluters honour their responsibilities. They shouldn\u2019t fall for the divide-and-rule tactic, which rich developed countries historically use to get away from their obligations.\u201d My colleague Fiona Harvey posted an excellent primer on the numbers earlier today. The head of OPEC, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, has echoed Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev\u2019s inflammatory comments in praise of oil and gas. \u201cThey are indeed a gift of God,\u201d secretary-general Haitham Al Ghais told the Cop29 summit earlier today. His comments come after Aliyev caused outrage last week with a spirited defence of oil and gas. Baku, where the climate summit is taking place, is home to the world\u2019s first industrial oil well, which my colleague Dharna visited earlier today. OPEC boss Al Ghais said the focus of the Paris climate agreement is reducing emissions, not choosing energy sources. \u201cWe need to embrace all energies, leverage all the available technologies, and ensure that the needs of all peoples around the world are taken into account.\u201d Mohamed Hamel, secretary general of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum, went a step further in his praise for fossil fuels. \u201cAs the world\u2019s population grows, the economy expands, and human living conditions improve, the world will need more natural gas, not less.\u201d Fossil fuels are the main source of the planet-heating pollutants that are making extreme weather more violent. Scientists expect some carbon dioxide will have to be captured from factories or sucked out of the atmosphere \u2013 at great cost in terms of money and energy \u2013 but they stress that the amount of fossil fuels that are burned must still plummet to keep the planet from heating 1.5C by the end of the century. A study last year found that more realistic assumptions of carbon capture and carbon dioxide removal meant fossil fuels would have to be ditched even faster than previously thought. It found the supply of coal would have to fall 99%, oil by 70% and gas by 84% between 2020 and 2050. \u201cThe climate crisis, biodiversity loss and the patriarchy continue to contribute to gender injustices,\u201d said Mwanahamisi Singano, speaking on behalf of the women and gender constituency earlier today. She called for negotiators to reflect the links between gender and the environment in the new climate finance goal. \u201cFor far too long, feminists have demanded gender-just and responsive climate finance.\u201d Women and girls are hit harder by climate change than men and boys but are often overlooked in climate policy. Women are more likely to be killed or displaced by extreme weather and have less access to the resources needed to rebuild their lives after a disaster. \u201cClimate finance that isn\u2019t gender-responsive or human rights-based is simply ineffective,\u201d said Singano. \u201cThere will be no climate justice without human rights and gender justice.\u201d Ahead of much anticipated draft texts later tonight, developing country ministers have been asked for their red lines on climate finance. Adonia Ayebare from Uganda spoke on behalf of the G77 and China, Ali Mohamed from Kenya spoke on behalf of the Africa group, and Diego Pacheco from Bolivia spoke on behalf of like-minded developing countries at a press conference a little while ago. When asked how they would respond to a $200bn climate finance target in the draft text, both Pacheo and Ayebare responded \u201cIs this a joke?\u201d This question was presumably based on reports in Politico that the EU would like to see a $200-$300bn target on climate finance poorer countries each year by 2035. Developing countries are insisting on a target north of $1tn each year. All three ministers were keeping their cards close to their chest, each repeating familiar rhetoric about the need for developed countries to pay their way as per the terms of the Paris agreement. We will find out more tomorrow when the text is out and ministers have had a chance to consider the draft proposals. It is important to remember that developing countries are a disparate group. The needs of Chad bear little resemblance to those of India. Most of the climate finance available today goes to relatively well-off developing countries with booming economies \u2013 middle-income countries take the lion\u2019s share of the $100bn goal, at about 57%, between 2016 and 2020. Of the remaining 43%, Small Island Developing States (SIDs) received just 2%, Least Developed Countries (LDCs) received 17%; and other Low-Income Countries (LICs) received 8%. So if there was some way to ensure that the poorest and most vulnerable countries could receive a greater share of the publicly funded climate finance \u2013 and particularly that portion of it that comes in the form of grants, rather than loans, to stop them drowning further in debt \u2013 then that would be a good outcome for the poorest. (Some of the richer developing countries would be unhappy about what they would see as losing out \u2013 India, for instance, argues it will not be able to accelerate its transition to clean energy without external assistance.) Some NGOs are adamant that private finance should not play a role in the NCQG, but few developing countries think they will see $1 trillion agreed without a sizeable role for the private sector. On Wednesday, the GFANZ group of private investors wrote to the UN to say: \u201cprivate finance firmly believes it is possible to mobilise the $1 trillion of private capital needed a year for climate action in EMDEs [emerging market and developing economies] by 2030, given the compelling business case for the transition. The NCQG can be a critical lever to make this happen.\u201d GFANZ has had a troubled history since its launch with fanfare at Glasgow \u2013 some members just will not stop investing in fossil fuels, alongside their green lending \u2013 but the signal of private companies being willing to invest is important. Would private finance be so bad? Well, twenty years ago most of the developing world struggled with telecommunications. Landlines were limited and expensive; mobile phone coverage was often non-existent. Today, mobile phone coverage is booming in almost all countries. There are few places in the world where it is impossible to use them. That was achieved almost entirely by private sector investment. Governments helped by providing regulation and access to the radio spectrum, but it was private sector cash that set up the markets and continues to make money. Few people complain about this \u2013 they just use the phones. The highly-polluting fashion industry is not top of the priority list in Baku but one social media account has been diligently documenting conversations about climate, culture and clothes. They include a jacket made out of factory waste, saris that stand for decolonisation, bazin and wax prints that symbolise African unity, and a kilt from the Scottish highlands that keep people \u201cgrounded to nature.\u201d Julia Bush, a communications consultant who set up the account at last year\u2019s Cop in Dubai, said she initially did so as a way to stay \u201cupbeat and positive during the marathon of long days and climate doom\u201d. But the more people she spoke to, she said, the more she understood how people were using fashion as a powerful tool to represent their cultures. \u201cI don\u2019t have a grand plan for what we do with it in the future, but it feels like a small way of capturing some hope, humanity and sensational outfits,\u201d she said. On my trip around Baku on Wednesday, I visited Villa Petrolea, where the Nobel brothers once lived and worked. Their company, Branobel Oil, was Baku\u2019s largest oil company in the late 1800s, when this region produced half of all oil used worldwide. My tour guide called the building a \u201cliving museum.\u201d Oil companies still hold events in its old meeting hall. During the Russian Revolution, my tour guide told me through a translator, the Nobel family fled their home. In their absence, it fell into disarray until it was reconstructed in 2002. One of the Nobel brothers, Alfred, was also the inventor of dynamite, earning him the nickname \u201cseller of death,\u201d said my tour guide. To restore his legacy, he used his fortune from his shares in the oil company to create the Nobel Prize. It\u2019s estimated that some 25% of the funds used to start the Nobel Foundation came from Branobel money. He said the site has seen a surge in tourism since COP29 began, with many attendees coming to visit the site. Asked if Azerbaijanis feel pride in this history, he said: \u201cIt is a matter of fact.\u201d At Branobel\u2019s peak, oil was a necessary part of the global economy, he added. \u201cWe can\u2019t change the past, we can\u2019t change history. It happened,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can change the future but that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t know what happened before.\u201d Here are some useful numbers to bear in mind when it comes to the negotiations. $5tn a year \u2013 that\u2019s the amount that NGOs say would represent at least a downpayment on the amount that developed countries owe to the developing world for their historic greenhouse gas emissions. (Although don\u2019t forget that the emissions of some large emerging economies are now so vast that they rival developed countries \u2013 China\u2019s historic emissions are now greater than those of the EU.) This sum is achievable, through taxes on fossil fuels and high-carbon activities, NGOs say. $3tn \u2013 the amount, roughly, likely to be spent on energy this year globally, according to the International Energy Agency. Of which two-thirds will be on clean energy, the remainder stubbornly still flowing to fossil fuels. $2.4tn a year \u2013 the amount developing countries (excluding China) need to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions, in line with the 1.5C goal of the Paris agreement, and adapt to the impacts of extreme weather, according to the International High Level Expert Group on climate finance, made up of senior global economists, led by Lord Stern, Vera Songwe and Amar Bhattacharya. $1tn a year by 2030, $1.3tn a year by 2035 \u2013 the slice of the above $2.4tn that should be met by external finance. The remainder can come and is already coming from developing countries\u2019 own domestic budgets. $1tn to $1.4tn a year \u2013 the amount developing countries are demanding in climate finance from the developed world at Cop29. $900bn a year \u2013 the amount that the Least Developed Countries and some other poor countries want to come in the form of public finance, preferably all or most of it in the form of grants rather than loans. $300bn \u2013 the amount developed countries are likely to offer in public finance to the developing world. $100bn \u2013 the amount of climate finance from public sources flowing from the developed to the developing world today. There is a big gap between $300bn and $1tn. But, according to the IHLEG, this gap can be filled in various ways. They suggest that $500bn in climate finance should come from the private sector, which is willing to invest in renewable energy, electric vehicles and other low-carbon technologies. According to IHLEG, about $80bn to $100bn a year should come from bilateral finance \u2013 that is, money going directly from developed to developing countries. That would be roughly double the current amount. An additional $250bn should come from development banks, including the World Bank. That\u2019s a stretch compared with the $120bn that the World Bank has just agreed to provide by 2030, which itself was a doubling on the previous amount (long derided as too small by developing countries). The remainder could come from a mixture of South-South funding; innovative forms of finance, also known as global solidarity levies \u2013 that is, levies such as a wealth tax, a charge on fossil fuels, a frequent flyer levy and similar measures; arcane forms of finance such as the International Monetary Fund\u2019s special drawing rights; carbon trading; and philanthropy. \u201cWe\u2019re reaching a point of real emotion here \u2013 these talks aren\u2019t just about technicalities and figures on paper, they\u2019re about people\u2019s lives,\u201d says Danni Taaffe, from Climate Action International. The Cop29 negotiations are now in the critical last few days. Campaigners play a crucial role at UN climate summits, representing and amplifying the voices of those most harmed by the climate crisis, and thousands of NGOs are officially recognised by the UN as \u201cobservers\u201d. \u201cAfrican countries wake up every morning to a crime they did not commit,\u201d says Marlene Achoki at Care International, who is close to the African Group of Negotiators (AGN), which represents 54 nations. \u201cTherefore AGN is very, very specific about its red lines.\u201d First, she said, is the request for $1.3tn of climate finance a year from rich nations, which are largely responsible for global heating. She said that number was backed by an in-depth assessment of needs. \u201cWe have had numbers flying around [from the EU] of $200bn, $300bn. What are those number based upon? They are a joke.\u201d Another red line is that the finance has to be from public sources and given as grants, Achoki said: \u201cA lot of African countries are in debt already, from climate loans and other issues.\u201d There is a major row about which nations should contribute to climate finance: the rich nations alone or those classed as developing nations in early climate treaties in the 1990s but which are now emerging economies, such as China and Saudi Arabia? Achoki said this row was being used to distract from agreeing on the $1tn. \u201cThese theatrics should not play any role \u2013 they are just strategies to derail the process.\u201d Safa\u2019 Al Jayoussi, from Oxfam International, said: \u201cI\u2019m a Palestinian woman fighting two battles today, the battle of climate finance and the battle to ensure that my family, my friends and colleagues are alive and safe. Instead of investing in life-saving aid and climate actions, countries are spending dollars on weapons that fuel wars. Those dollars are stolen from climate action and stolen from fighting inequality, poverty and hunger.\u201d She said the ultimate finance target was $5tn a year from rich countries. \u201cThe richest countries are responsible for 92% of excess emissions and built their wealth from colonialism, neo-colonialism and exploitation of nature and people. It\u2019s not charity that we are asking for. Civil society groups are calling for $5tn in climate debt and reparations.\u201d Much of existing climate finance goes to middle-income countries, while some poor and vulnerable nations are receiving nothing: \u201cSomalia is one and is facing devastating drought and floods. These back-to-back crises have pushed 4 million people \u2013 21% of the population into emergency levels of hunger.\u201d The Least Developed Countries group, of 45 nations including Somalia, is calling for $220bn a year to be specifically allocated to them, while the small island state group, Aosis, is calling for $39bn. Money is the key question at this Cop, but no country has so far put any on the table. We know that the needs of developing countries are at least $1tn a year, but there is little agreement on how that should be achieved and how it can be broken down. Today Cop29 is essentially stuck \u2013 delegations are waiting for a new text on the climate finance settlement, known as the NCQG (new collective quantified goal). That text is not now expected until the early hours of Thursday morning. Of that $1tn, only some is expected to come from developed countries. Just how much is a matter of keen discussion. Developed countries have told the Guardian they cannot put any numbers on the table until a new clean text has been delivered that makes clear the structure of the NCQG \u2013 that is, the division between publicly provided finance from developed country taxpayers, finance provided indirectly, the timeframe for providing finance and terms on who should be expected to contribute. There have been rumours that the EU was poised to put $200bn to $300bn on the table \u2013 those figures are indeed in line with the EU has been talking about, as have other developed countries, to the Guardian\u2019s knowledge. But the EU and other developed and developing countries have told the Guardian that no actual move has yet been made within the negotiating rooms to discuss such a number. A real sticking point is over how countries still classed as developing but which have large and growing economies, and high greenhouse gas emissions, should be treated. Rich countries want such nations \u2013 China is the obvious one but countries like South Korea, and petro states such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are also included \u2013 to start contributing to climate finance. Under the Paris agreement of 2015, only countries classed as developed when its parent treaty, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, was signed in 1992 are legally obliged to contribute to climate finance. China and other developing countries want to preserve this distinction. But there may be some compromise possible on this \u2013 China already provides billions every year to the Global South, though much of it is in the form of loans. The EU and other developed countries want China to give more details of this spending, but they are not demanding a reclassification of China as a developed country. Over the next few days, if the impasse is to be broken, some developed countries will need to put forward actual figures on what they think their contribution to the NCQG could be. This is hard \u2013 Cop29 is not a pledging conference so no country will be expected to say what they intend to spend individually on climate finance in the future. This is a collective goal \u2013 but the developed countries do not negotiate as a bloc, so no one among them can take responsibility for speaking for all. In normal times, the US might have been expected to take a lead \u2013 perhaps alongside China, as the G2 pair have done in previous Cop talks. But with a Trump presidency looming the US is in less of a position to do so. Today, I broke free from the clutches of the COP29 conference centre. My first stop was the monument to the world\u2019s first industrially drilled oil well, opened in 1846. Just metres away, there are a handful of currently operating oil wells, which I watched nodding away. Eventually, I saw a SOCAR worker walking towards one, and stopped to talk to him about the climate crisis. Asked what oil means for Azerbaijan, the 47-year-old worker told me: \u201cToo much!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s our future,\u201d he said through a translator, \u201cand our green future.\u201d Confused, I asked how oil is green. He said SOCAR has made efforts to clean up its oil supply, which is a \u201cgood thing.\u201d Asked what he makes of efforts to slash fossil fuel usage worldwide, he said in 100 years, he imagines the world will be far less reliant on oil. The worker, who has been at SOCAR for 15 years, said he has seen the impacts of the climate crisis firsthand. Baku\u2019s winters have warmed considerably, he said, and snow is arriving later in the winter all around Azerbaijan. He was well aware that COP29 is taking place just a 30 minute drive from his job site. \u201cIt\u2019s important,\u201d he said. As climate negotiations rumble on, a study has found the strongest gusts of wind that batter towns and cities across North America have been made stronger by fossil fuel pollution. Research from Climate Central found climate change boosted maximum wind speeds for 84% of Atlantic hurricanes between 2019 and 2023 by an average of 18 miles per hour. Hotter seas hold more energy that hurricanes can unleash on unsuspecting communities, wiping out lives, homes and jobs. \u201cEvery hurricane in 2024 was stronger than it would have been 100 years ago,\u201d said lead author Daniel Gilford. \u201cThrough record-breaking ocean warming, human carbon pollution is worsening hurricane catastrophes in our communities.\u201d Although climate scientists do not expect hurricanes to get more common as the planet heats up, their models \u2013 and basic physics \u2013 show they will get stronger. The study found 30 hurricanes hit levels of intensity that were roughly one category higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale, a measure of how strong their winds hit. Hello, Ajit Niranjan here taking over from Matthew Taylor for the rest of the day. Please send us tips if you\u2019re in Baku, and requests for what we should be covering if you\u2019re not. Thanks! Away from Cop29 talks my colleague Sandra Laville has an important story on how the corporations behind the Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW) have actually been produced huge amounts of new plastic in the past five years. The AEPW was set up in 2019 by a group of companies which include ExxonMobil, Dow, Shell, TotalEnergies and ChevronPhillips, some of the world\u2019s biggest producers of plastic. They promised to divert 15m tonnes of plastic waste from the environment in five years to the end of 2023, by improving collection and recycling, and creating a circular economy. But new analysis by energy consultants Wood Mackenzie, obtained by Greenpeace\u2019s Unearthed team and shared with the Guardian reveals the five companies alone produced 132m tonnes of two types of plastic; polyethylene (PE) and PP (polypropylene) in five years \u2013 more than 1,000 times the weight of the 118,500 tonnes of waste plastic the alliance has removed from the environment in the same period. Earlier today I posted about an excellent piece colleagues at the Guardian have published tracking how Earth\u2019s heating has led to rising sea levels and extreme weather \u2013 and yet there is no sign of emissions slowing. Unfortunately I did not include a link to the piece [it was early UK time!] so here it is [and as I said original if negotiators at Cop need any motivation to reach a deal they could do worse than read this] Negotiators are into the last stretch of Cop29, which is when sleep becomes a luxury. The next texts are due at midnight tonight Baku time, says Yalchin Rafiyev, who is the Cop29 presidency\u2019s lead negotiator. Draft texts and revisions are how Cops inch towards a deal, narrowing down options step-by-step to a final decision. Rafiyev said the text on the all-important climate finance deal is set to drop at midnight Baku time. Texts on action to cut emissions (mitigation), increasing protection for communities against climate disasters (adaptation) and national climates pledges (NDCs) will also be published then, he said. He said the texts \u201cwould not have a huge number of options\u201d and would be \u201cshorter, more concise, straight to the point\u201d compared with earlier versions, which were bloated by contrasting proposals from different countries. Rafiyev also said that work was not taking place on a \u201ccover text\u201d, which is a broad statement often agreed at Cops to send a political message. He said the aim was to make agreements within the formal negotiating strands and not open a \u201cnew battlefront\u201d between countries. The Maldives, a group of islands in the Indian Ocean, is liable for just 0.003% of global emissions. But it is one of the first countries to endure the existential consequences of the climate crisis. At Cop29, I caught up with Thoriq Ibrahim, the country\u2019s minister of climate change, environment and energy, who is leading negotiations for the small island nation. \u201cWe\u2019re not causing climate change, it\u2019s the [developed] countries that did that,\u201d he said. \u201cThey did that to us, and we are not at all prepared.\u201d Cop29\u2019s goal of adopting a new and expanded goal for climate finance to help vulnerable nations slash emissions and cope with climate disasters, is of particular importance to the Maldives. The last climate finance goal, adopted in 2009, did not allocate specific funding to small island developing states. Ibrahim says that must change. \u201cWe must be allocated at least $39bn USD per year,\u201d he said. To ensure that money is accessible, he is also calling for the adoption of a multidimensional vulnerability index \u2013 a new way to measure countries\u2019 climate need that considers not only their wealth, but also their vulnerability. Last year, a \u201closs and damage fund\u201d was created at Cop28 to help nations cope with irreversible climate damages. So far, wealthy countries\u2019 contributions to that fund constitute a tiny fraction of what is needed. It\u2019s important for the Maldives to be able to access those monies quickly, said Ibrahim. His country could be completely swallowed by the rising seas by 2100 or sooner, research shows. \u201cOnce our islands are destroyed, what do we have,\u201d he asked. \u201cWe are in a special circumstance because of this major threat.\u201d At Cop29, Ibrahim is also demanding countries submit national climate action plans that are aligned with keeping global temperature rise less than 1.5C degrees higher than preindustrial temperatures. It\u2019s a goal that many experts say has already been missed \u2013 or at best is on life support. \u201cMaybe we will go past that goal, overshoot it, and then bring the temperatures back down,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the scientists say it\u2019s possible to limit the warming, and so we must, must try.\u201d With negotiations seemingly bogged down in Baku, former France envoy and former Cop28 adviser Paul Watkinson, writing on social media, has \u2013 not entirely seriously - put forward a way of reinvigorating the talks. He suggests the president of Azerbaijan since 2003, Ilham Aliyev, could be kept away to allow negotiators to do their work. And he cites a precedent to prove that keeping embarrassing leaders out of the lime light can help; Cop26 in Glasgow when a certain Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson \u2013 then UK PM \u2013 was conspicuously absent for the second week of negotiations. As Watkinson puts it: The UK somehow managed to keep Boris Johnson and his gaffes away from Cop26 during the second week \u2013 that might be a good precedent for the COP29 presidency to follow in the coming days Last week one of the main themes to come out of Cop29 was the need to reform the entire process. The impetus for that came after this piece in which a group of influential climate policy experts said the Cop system was no longer fit for purpose. In response the Guardian has published a series of letters from readers debating the future of the summits. Activists have been out at the conference in Baku this morning trying to put pressure on negotiators to agree a deal on climate finance. An alliance of countries aiming to transform global food systems will reconvene today, one year after its launch at COP28, to highlight progress since Dubai and to urge governments and financial institutions at the conference in Baku to prioritise climate finance for food systems. Co-chairs of the Alliance of Champions for Food Systems Transformation Brazil, Norway and Sierra Leone, alongside founding members Cambodia and Rwanda, released an ACF Ministerial Statement, as well as a series of \u2018Progress Snapshots\u2019, highlighting key successes in each country and setting out priorities for further work. \u201cWe need to see a rapid and sustained increase in both the overall quantum of climate finance and the proportion going towards transforming food systems, which are estimated to require $500 billion per year over the next decade,\u201d the statement said. \u201cDespite being responsible for a third of greenhouse gas emissions, 90% of deforestation and 60% of biodiversity loss, Food systems received just 3.4% of the total $115.9bn climate finance mobilised by developed countries in 2022. The snapshots, which showcase progress from across the ACF member countries since launch, include: In Brazil, a National Program for Productive Forests (Programa Nacional de Florestas Produtivas) to promote sustainable agroforestry practices, enhance food production, generate employment, and restore degraded areas. The program\u2019s initial phase targets the state of Par\u00e1 and supports Brazil\u2019s wider commitments to restore 12 million hectares by 2030 and create up to 2.5 million jobs. In Cambodia, the deployment of 1,600 agriculture officers in agricultural communes across the country, developing modern agricultural cooperatives to improve access to markets, capital and water, whilst also increasing the economic efficiency and sustainability of smallholders; In Norway, an annual policy dialogue with farming unions to negotiate policy measures that are tailored to farmers\u2019 needs, delivering a \u2018bottom up\u2019 participatory approach that is designed to deliver against the country\u2019s national and international commitments; In Rwanda, a commitment by 2030 to halve per capita food waste at the retail and consumer levels and to reduce food losses in farm production and along supply chains, including post-harvest losses. In Sierra Leone, the implementation of the national flagship \u2018Feed Salone\u2019 strategy is sustainably driving local food production by making agriculture more competitive for investment, decreasing food imports and supporting smallholder farmers, especially women and youth. Alliance called on other governments to join them. \u201cToday, we are also calling for governments who share our ambition to create a fairer, healthier and more prosperous future to join us. The actions that each of us take within our borders can enhance our peoples\u2019 food and nutritional security, boost equity and livelihoods, increase climate resilience, protect and restore nature, and help mitigate climate breakdown.\u201d In response to this ask, Tanzania has officially announced today its intention to join the ACF and is set to become the newest member of the coalition. H.E. Paulo Teixeira, Minister of Agrarian Development and Family Farming, Brazil, and co-chair of ACF, said: \u201cAs Brazil looks towards COP30 next year, I am proud to be part of this important Alliance which continues to make the case for fairer, more sustainable food systems. Whether it is tackling hunger, supporting family farmers to produce nutritious food sustainably, driving the agro-ecological transition or protecting the rainforest, we can only improve outcomes in the long run if we look at the system holistically. To do that, we must address the climate finance gap for food systems at COP29\u201d. As we wait for day nine to get going it is worth looking back at the closing summary from yesterday when the overriding feeling from negotiators was frustration as progress continued to prove elusive. Let\u2019s hope for more positive news today. Yesterday\u2019s closing summary: As day eight began, the climate talks entered the phase known as the \u2018valley of death\u2019 Raising funds to finance climate fight is feasible, economists say from my colleague Fiona Harvey Cop was boosted as G20 reaffirms transition from fossil fuels, although some felt the Brazil meeting could have gone much further Analysis showed that hundreds of lobbyists for industrial agriculture were attending the Cop29 climate summit in Baku UK, New Zealand, and Colombia join coalition to phase out fossil fuel subsidies Argentina to stay in the Paris agreement - foreign minister It\u2019s day nine at the Cop29 talks in Baku and the swarms of delegates have started to thin. The morning queues are not as long. Tired negotiators have been working late into the night as the climate summit builds to a crescendo. One delegation that will not be in the room for the end of Cop29 is Argentina who withdrew their representatives after just three days. The South American country, led by the climate denier Javier Milei, had said it was contemplating leaving the Paris agreement after it made the decision. There have been rumours that the country was set to announce its departure within days, particularly when Milei became the first world leader to meet Donald Trump since his reelection. But now, the country\u2019s foreign minister Gerardo Werthein has said they are staying. Speaking to El Observador, he said that the country was simply reevaluating its position given that they disagreed with parts of the Paris agreement. But Argentina will not leave the accord, he said. Last week, observers privately wondered if the chainsaw-wielding libertarian had simply been showing off to get attention from his fans abroad. Milei - one of the most prolific world leaders on X - has been reposting memes hinting that he was minded to block the mention of climate change in G20 declarations but ultimately did not. Last week\u2019s decision to remove its representatives has started to have consequences for delegates from civil society who sometimes get their accreditation from their home countries. Tais Gadea Lara, a climate reporter from Argentina, posted photos on social media of civil society representatives who had their access cancelled due to Argentina\u2019s withdrawal from Cop29. Other delegations are helping them out, she reports, but it is a reminder of the vast network of people that come to these summits all working towards the same thing. Good morning. Day nine at Cop29 and we\u2019ll be following all the developments here. I\u2019m Matthew Taylor, please send me your thoughts and suggestions at matthew.taylor@theguardian.com",

It opened just one net new store, according to the accounts, compared with 45 in the previous year. The grocer notched up an almost 17% jump in revenues last financial year, to \u00a310.9bn. Lidl said its growth was driven by significant investment in upgrading stores, with more fridges to improve product freshness, expanded ranges and competitive prices as well as a 24% rise in users of its loyalty scheme. McDonnell said: \u201cNow, 60% of households are choosing to shop at Lidl, and they\u2019re coming back more frequently, which is a fantastic sign of increasing loyalty. We have great momentum and, although our ambitions have no ceiling, we won\u2019t rest on our laurels.\u201d McDonnell also said that men were buying more from its middle aisle of unusual, limited-time stock, from toys to thermal underwear. \u201cWe often get partners at odds with each other because men have disappeared up the aisle and are buying things they maybe already have,\u201d he told the BBC. Lidl said its strongest growth came from fresh produce, where sales rose 22%. Bakery sales also increased strongly, making Lidl the second largest retailer in the category, ahead of much bigger chains including Asda and Morrisons.",

      "bodyText": "Senate Republicans must soon consider several of Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet picks whose nominations were met with intense criticism: Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence, Matt Gaetz as attorney general, Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense and Robert F Kennedy Jr as secretary of health and human services. Each of those cabinet announcements landed with somewhat of a thud on Capitol Hill, raising questions about whether the nominees will be able to muster the majority-level support needed in the Senate to get confirmed. But the president-elect has proposed an archaic and in recent years little-used mechanism to get his nominees installed without Senate confirmation: recess appointments. \u201cAny Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner,\u201d Trump said earlier this month. \u201cWe need positions filled IMMEDIATELY!\u201d If Trump pursues a strategy of recess appointments, it could severely curtail the Senate\u2019s power to serve as a check on the new president\u2019s nominations and allow controversial picks to move forward. Here\u2019s everything to know about recess appointments: What does the constitution say about Senate confirmation of presidential nominations? Article 2, section 2 of the US constitution states that the president \u201cshall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States\u201d. Hundreds of senior officials in the federal government, including all members of the president\u2019s cabinet, are subject to Senate approval, meaning they need the support of a majority of the 100-member upper chamber to be confirmed. How do recess appointments allow a president to circumvent the Senate confirmation process? Although the US constitution outlines how the Senate serves as a check on presidential nominations, it also provides an alternate route for installing officials who are usually subject to the confirmation process. Article 2, section 2 further states that the president \u201cshall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session\u201d. This allows the president to install nominees in posts that might otherwise go vacant while the Senate is out of session. If Trump were to utilize recess appointments at the start of his term, those appointees could stay in their posts until the end of the next Senate session, or until the end of 2026. Why do recess appointments exist? Recess appointments have been criticized as an anachronism dating back to the country\u2019s founding, when Congress was in session much less frequently than it is now and correspondence over an important vacancy in the federal government could take weeks. Today, when instant communication and air travel are the norm, the idea that the president may need to rely on recess appointments to fill key government posts appears absurd, sparking criticism of the practice in recent years. Have other recent presidents relied on recess appointments? According to the Congressional Research Service, Bill Clinton made 139 recess appointments, while George W Bush made 171 recess appointments. But Barack Obama only made 32 recess appointments, as the supreme court issued a critical ruling on the practice during his presidency. In its 2014 decision of NLRB v Noel Canning, the court ruled that several of Obama\u2019s recess appointments had violated the constitution because the Senate was not out of session long enough to merit those appointments. The court noted that a Senate recess of at least 10 days is required to allow for recess appointments. In recent years, particularly when the Senate and the White House have been controlled by opposing parties, Senate majority leaders have relied on pro forma sessions, in which no real congressional business is conducted, to limit recesses. For that reason, neither Trump nor Biden had any recess appointments. Would Senate Republicans allow Trump to use recess appointments for his cabinet nominees? That remains unclear, although the newly elected Senate majority leader, Republican John Thune of South Dakota, has suggested he is open to the idea. \u201cWe must act quickly and decisively to get the president\u2019s nominees in place as soon as possible, [and] all options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments,\u201d Thune said. \u201cWe cannot let Schumer and Senate [Democrats] block the will of the American people.\u201d That being said, Thune acknowledged that it might be difficult to recess the chamber if a substantial number of Republican senators oppose a particular nomination. \u201cYou have to have all Republicans vote to recess as well,\u201d Thune told Fox News last week. \u201cSo the same Republicans \u2026 that might have a problem voting for somebody under regular order probably also have a problem voting to put the Senate into recess.\u201d Another complication is the role of the House in the recess process, as the constitution stipulates that neither the House nor the Senate can adjourn for more than three days without the consent of the other chamber.

I asked him to voice up for Hong Kong and support us, but there was never anything particularly that I asked for.\u201d He also confirmed his having met Nancy Pelosi, who at the time was the US House speaker, but he said that he did not speak in that meeting, only listened. He denied ever trying to appeal to foreign officials to influence government policy in China. Eric Lai (no relation), a research fellow at the Georgetown Center for Asian Law, said Jimmy Lai\u2019s evidence showed \u201cthat the charge of colluding with foreign forces under the NSL was so broad and unreasonable that [it] criminalises ordinary exchange and communications activities with [people] overseas\u201d. He has not called for Hong\u2019s Kong independence Apple Daily represented \u201cHong Kong values\u201d of the rule of law, democracy, and political and social freedoms, Lai said. But he said that neither he \u2013 or the paper \u2013 ever went as far as calling for Hong Kong\u2019s independence. Such ideas were \u201ca reality too crazy to think about\u201d and discussion of it was banned in Apple Daily. \u201cI always thought the advocacy of independence for Hong Kong was a conspiracy, because people just wanted us to advocate just to get us into a trap,\u201d he said. But the newspaper\u2019s readers were not easily impressionable, Lai insisted. \u201cThe more information you have, the more you are in the know and the more you are free,\u201d he said.",

They were kindred spirits only a few years apart in age.</p> <p>\u201cShe came to me along with a few friends and told me that the film reminded her of Cuba a lot and she resonated with everything depicted in the film,\u201d says Wang, 38, over Zoom from her home in Montclair, New Jersey. \u201cI was curious about Cuba, and was like, tell me about it, what is Cuba like? We ended up speaking and realising that it\u2019s so similar what we\u2019ve experienced. We were able to finish each other\u2019s sentences. \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s how the government dealt with us too.\u2019<em>\u201d</em></p> <p>Wang was fascinated by the story of Pay\u00e1\u2019s father, <a href=\"https://victimsofcommunism.org/award/oswaldo-paya/\">Oswaldo Pay\u00e1</a>, a leading dissident and pro-democracy activist nominated five times for the Nobel peace prize who died in a 2012 car crash; last year the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-American_Commission_on_Human_Rights\" title=\"Inter-American Commission on Human Rights\">Inter-American Commission of Human Rights</a> held the Cuban state responsible for his murder.</p> <p>Wang was also seeking answers to doubts about her own ability to make an impact as a film-maker. She recalls: \u201cMy first film premiered at <a href=\"https://festival.sundance.org/\">Sundance</a>. When it came out, immediately there were reviews and I thought, this is it, they are going to release the activists who are in prison because of the pressure from all of the news and publicity. I was naive enough to believe that immediate change would happen. It didn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cMonths later, I started wondering, if this is not going to lead to any concrete small change, such as releasing the imprisoned activists, then what is the meaning of my work? How can my work be impactful? What can I do? Seeing Rosa, we shared the values of wanting to create change in our countries and she is doing something different: on-the-ground activism.</p> <p>\u201cI felt that she had a lot more optimism feeling that, yes, Cuba is going to become a democracy and we\u2019re going to see it. It was that difference and then also a sense of admiration for her determination and optimism that led me to say, \u2018I want to make a film with you. Can I go to Cuba with you? Can I see what it\u2019s like there?\u2019\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz2kRinQV80\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lz2kRinQV80?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Wang and Pay\u00e1 flew into Cuba together but, as a precaution, acted as if they didn\u2019t know each other on the plane and airport, communicating by text message instead. Once they got to work on the ground, Wang observed how Pay\u00e1 swapped taxis often to shake off pursuers, how activists changed phone batteries when meeting and how, even at home, Pay\u00e1 played loud music to drown out conversations.</p> <p>She says: \u201cThe challenge was not knowing when those people who are following us constantly would make a move and then come forward in direct confrontation, whether it\u2019s confiscating the camera or putting me in detention. That\u2019s unknown. I felt that\u2019s very similar to working in China.</p> <p>\u201cOnce you are in public, you always have to be prepared for the worst. So every time I step out of the car, step out at the house, I need to make a calculation. Do I want to hide all my hard drives? Do I want to bring only a memory card that\u2019s empty? What if this is the time that they took everything? Am I prepared for that consequence? So each time going out is like getting ready for that.\u201d</p> <p>Wang followed Pay\u00e1 to a convention of Cuban democracy activists in Puerto Rico. Some were from inside Cuba but the majority were living in exile. Wang had never seen such a level of organisation among Chinese dissidents, who are riven by infighting and division. But before long the meeting descended into chaos. It was dominated by an older generation of activists; Pay\u00e1 was among the youngest people there but, if frustrated, she did not let it show.</p> <p>The age divide among activists reminded Wang of China. \u201cThe younger generation are much more creative. They tend to use art and want to use music and visual art and that kind of a medium to engage civil society. The older generation \u2013 this is a general observation \u2013 tend to be more radical.</p> <p>\u201cThe internet in both countries is a big, useful tool for them to do activism. Things that used to be impossible 20 years ago are now being utilised on social media. They could gather people, they could make something viral, before the censorship.\u201d</p> <p>Wang also compared and contrasted how the governments of both countries seek to crush dissent. \u201cChina is much more advanced in technology. In Cuba I felt a lot of times the agents who followed us would take shifts of three different cars, three different people, and everywhere we go, they are physically tailing us.</p> <p>\u201cIn China that happens too but more likely is tracking through phone devices everywhere you go \u2013 like you have a digital chase. When I was working in China, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily have people trail me all the time, but definitely everywhere I appeared there would be new people just parachuting there and waiting for me.\u201d</p> <p>But the title of Wang\u2019s film implies that there is light at the end of the tunnel, that the autocracies of China and Cuba are not forever. <em>\u201c</em>Rosa is more optimistic than me,\u201d she admits. \u201cShe thinks this could last maybe 10 or 20 years. She thinks change could happen tomorrow. I might not be as optimistic, especially with everything happening in the US as well, but as I said in the film, it\u2019s a choice to remain optimistic and believe that eventually, if it\u2019s 30 years or 50 years or who knows, eventually it won\u2019t last.\u201d</p>    <p>The global struggle between democracy and autocracy was an early theme of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency in the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. The recent election was filled with warnings that Trump is a would-be dictator poised to tear down US democracy and curry favour with strongmen including the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping.</p> <p>In 2018 Xi <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/11/world/asia/china-xi-constitution-term-limits.html\" title=\"\">changed</a> the Chinese constitution so that he can in effect remain in power indefinitely. Night Is Not Eternal includes footage of Trump saying: \u201cPresident Xi, president for life. President for life \u2013 that sounds good. Maybe we\u2019re going to have to try it \u2013 president for life.\u201d</p> <p>Wang does not feel that US democracy is stable or guaranteed. She recalls of Trump\u2019s first election: \u201cDefinitely 2016 was the year that caused everyone to think: is this the America that we know? For me personally, it was the moment that I questioned, did I just have a misunderstanding about America or has America changed? For the past years since then my feeling has been it\u2019s not that America changed that year. It is a long history and maybe what I assumed America was is not actually how it is.\u201d</p> <p>This time Trump ran a campaign based on retribution, vowing to prosecute election officials, journalists and other perceived political enemies. His central promise was a crackdown on illegal immigration and border security. He referred to undocumented immigrants as \u201canimals\u201d who he said were \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/16/trump-immigrants-new-hampshire-rally\">poisoning the blood of our country</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Even so, some immigrants apparently gravitated toward Trump for reasons including his economic populism, social conservatism and rabid anti-communism, as well as the hard line he takes on those coming to the country undocumented. He made significant inroads among the Latino community, becoming the first Republican since 1988 <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hispanic-voters-trump-florida-texas-pennsylvania-democrats-3637d86dede99e36f35d725afabdcba1\">to win Florida\u2019s Miami-Dade county</a>, home to a sizable Cuban population.</p> <p>While making the film, Wang was initially taken aback by Pay\u00e1\u2019s willingness to share a platform with Trump and reluctance to either endorse or condemn him. A day after the election, the pragmatic <a href=\"https://x.com/RosaMariaPaya/status/1854252664856437239\">Pay\u00e1 tweeted</a>: \u201cCongratulations to the US people for a powerful democratic exercise, and to President @realDonaldTrump on your historic victory.\u201d</p> <p>Wang, who became a naturalised US citizen two years ago, reflects: \u201cMy community, the Chinese community, is equally polarised. What is confusing and very interesting is this includes a lot of the people with whom I might share the values of wanting democracy and freedom and change in our own home country.</p> <p>\u201cBut here in America what we consider represents democracy, what is the solution, what leads to democracy, what is the threat to democracy, are complete opposites. Those Chinese friends who share the same values in China with me might argue that Trump is the person who is going to uphold democracy in America. The views are so drastically opposite.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s use of terms such as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\">Chinese virus</a>\u201d and \u201ckung flu\u201d were widely blamed for fuelling an environment of hatred towards Asian Americans during the Covid-19 pandemic. The former president also branded Taiwan-born Elaine Chao, his former transportation secretary and the wife of Senator Mitch McConnell, with the nickname \u201cCoco Chow\u201d.</p> <p>Yet many Chinese Americans support Trump because, in their view, he took a long-overdue hawkish stand against Beijing. Wang continues: \u201cWhen I ask them, what about Trump\u2019s anti-Asian remarks, they interpret: \u2018He\u2019s not against us, he calls it the China virus because he\u2019s against the Chinese government, he\u2019s against communism, he is against the CCP [Chinese Communist party].\u2019 In that sense they share the values of he\u2019s attacking China.\u201d</p>    <p>Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/17/trump-transition-biden\">jaw-dropping array</a> of cabinet nominations so far have offered little comfort to Democrats or democrats. They include Matt Gaetz, a scandal-plagued former congressman eager to upend the justice department and wage vengeance on Trump\u2019s behalf, for attorney general, the country\u2019s top law enforcement official. Others, such as Tom Homan and Stephen Miller, are itching to launch the biggest deportation operation in history from the get-go.</p> <p>Wang comments: \u201cIt\u2019s like picking all the loyalists in your government to run the government and that\u2019s what Xi Jinping did when he became president, replacing everyone with his loyalists regardless of their competency. They\u2019re not chosen because of their expertise, because of their competence. It\u2019s purely based on how loyal they are to the person. That will inevitably lead to chaos and corruption and so that\u2019s concerning.\u201d</p> <p>The issue of mass deportation looms large for Wang\u2019s family members, friends and acquaintances. \u201cI already started hearing so many.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI don\u2019t believe in America being the beacon of democracy,\u201d says the documentary film-maker Nanfu Wang. \u201cAmerica sliding into autocracy is not something that is unimaginable.\u201d Terms such as democracy and autocracy have been thrown around a lot since the re-election of Donald Trump as US president. But Wang speaks with unusual authority on this subject. She was born in China and lived under its authoritarian regime until 2011 when, aged 26, she moved to the US because of its promise of democracy and freedom. Now she has made a film, Night Is Not Eternal, based on seven years following the activist Rosa Mar\u00eda Pay\u00e1 in her fight for democratic reform in Cuba. The narrative explores how Cuba\u2019s struggle against tyranny rhymes with that in China, which Wang still regards as home but where her films are banned, and how the erosion of democratic norms in the US throws both into sharp relief. It also provokes a conversation about the dislocation of the immigrant experience and whether it is possible to effect change from afar. Wang discovers that Pay\u00e1, now based in Miami, Florida, does not necessarily share her critique of Trump as a profound threat to democracy. Members of the Chinese diaspora are similarly divided. Wang first met Pay\u00e1 in March 2016 at a film festival in Prague in the Czech Republic, where she was showing her first film, Hooligan Sparrow, which follows a human rights activist seeking justice for six sexually abused schoolgirls. They were kindred spirits only a few years apart in age. \u201cShe came to me along with a few friends and told me that the film reminded her of Cuba a lot and she resonated with everything depicted in the film,\u201d says Wang, 38, over Zoom from her home in Montclair, New Jersey. \u201cI was curious about Cuba, and was like, tell me about it, what is Cuba like? We ended up speaking and realising that it\u2019s so similar what we\u2019ve experienced. We were able to finish each other\u2019s sentences. \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s how the government dealt with us too.\u2019\u201d Wang was fascinated by the story of Pay\u00e1\u2019s father, Oswaldo Pay\u00e1, a leading dissident and pro-democracy activist nominated five times for the Nobel peace prize who died in a 2012 car crash; last year the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights held the Cuban state responsible for his murder. Wang was also seeking answers to doubts about her own ability to make an impact as a film-maker. She recalls: \u201cMy first film premiered at Sundance.

She says: \u201cThe challenge was not knowing when those people who are following us constantly would make a move and then come forward in direct confrontation, whether it\u2019s confiscating the camera or putting me in detention.

A ref getting booted repeatedly up the backside after being chased around the pitch by an angry Ecuadorian centre-back, for example. Or a mass brawl that resulted in three Chileans and two Paraguayans getting shown straight reds and refusing to leave the field. Or perhaps a pitch invasion led by angry Peruvians upset that one of their players has been sent off for blowing his trumpet in the fourth official\u2019s ear at full blast. In summary, the kind of scenes that \u201cnobody wants to see\u201d, unless of course they happen to unfold thousands of miles away, in which case we all want to see them.</p> <p>So, when we spoke to the Football Daily Ed earlier and suggested that Wales topping their Nations League group with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/19/wales-iceland-nations-league-match-report\">a fine win over Iceland</a>, coupled with Craig Bellamy\u2019s post-match remarks about only taking the job to prove to everyone that he is not completely crazy [well, that\u2019s spoiled Quote of the Day \u2013 Football Daily Ed], was the only show in town for today\u2019s thrilling instalment of the world\u2019s most daily football email, our curiosity was piqued when that idea was shot down in flames and we were told to \u201cdo something on what happened in Brazil instead\u201d. Oblivious to overnight news of any crowd violence, pitch invasions, acts of GBH on a match official or the Delapping of severed animal heads on to the field of play during Brazil\u2019s World Cup qualifier against Uruguay, we immediately went a\u2019Googling to see what on earth had happened during the game and find out how it had passed us by.</p> <p>The answer?

Having gone behind to a fine strike from Uruguay\u2019s Fede Valverde, Brazil equalised soon after courtesy of Gerson (not <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9rson\">that</a></em> one), whose first goal for his country leaves them fifth in the South American qualifying table, two points off second place and still set extremely fair to be among the six teams that qualify automatically. And quite frankly, if thinking such a scenario is far less interesting than Bellamy\u2019s amusing take on why he became manager of Wales is wrong, then Football Daily doesn\u2019t want to be right.</p> <p>However, we\u2019re just here to follow orders, here\u2019s what Raphinha had to say about the barracking to which he and his teammates were subjected. \u201cI think the booing is more about the result, because in my opinion we gave it all,\u201d he gasped. \u201cI\u2019m proud of those who played and even those on the bench. We did everything we could to get the result. We played a lot of football and we have to leave with our heads held high.\u201d The same cannot be said for Football Daily, whose head could scarcely hang any lower as it slinks apologetically into your spam folder with this disappointingly inconsequential news at the tail-end of what has been, by our snakebelly low standards, an otherwise uncharacteristically productive interlull.</p> <h2><strong>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</strong></h2> <p>Join Sarah Rendell from 8pm GMT for minute-by-minute coverage of Chelsea 4-1 Celtic in Women\u2019s Big Cup.</p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI probably feel it was important to show people I am not a lunatic \u2013 I\u2019m quite sane.

UK officials should exhaust all channels to ask for the immediate release of political prisoners.

The layoffs will be made by the end of 2027. Globally, they represent around 2.3% of Ford\u2019s workforce of 174,000.</p> <p>The company blamed significant losses in recent years caused by weak demand for electric vehicles, a lack of government support for the shift to EVs, and growing competition.</p> <p>Ford is the latest carmaker after <strong>Nissan</strong>, <strong>Stellantis</strong> and <strong>General Motors</strong> to cut costs as the industry struggles with growing competition from Chinese rivals in Europe, waning demand in China, and the challenges of selling electric cars that are still too expensive for many people to buy.</p> <p>The European Union has imposed tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, which it says benefit from unfair subsidies from the Beijing government.</p> <p>Ford\u2019s move deals a big blow to Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy. <strong>Volkswagen</strong> is threatening to close factories, slash wages and cut thousands of jobs to improve its ability to compete. The country is also in political crisis, with a snap election in February, while companies grapple with growing trade tensions with China and the threat of US tariffs following <strong>Donald Trump</strong>\u2019s victory in the US presidential election.</p> <p>Ford said Europe\u2019s automakers </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>face significant competitive and economic headwinds while also tackling a misalignment between CO2 regulations and consumer demand for electrified vehicles.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ford\u2019s sales in Europe plunged by 17.9% in September, far outstripping an industrywide decline of 6.1%.</p> <p>Ford called on the German government to provide more incentives and better charging infrastructure to help consumers transition to EVs. Berlin ended EV subsidies in December last year, and sales of electric cars in Germany were down by 28.6% in the first nine months of this year.</p> <p>Ford\u2018s chief financial officer <strong>John Lawler</strong> wrote in a letter to the German government:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we lack in Europe and Germany is an unmistakable, clear policy agenda to advance e-mobility, such as public investments in charging infrastructure, meaningful incentives ... and greater flexibility in meeting CO2 compliance targets.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ford already announced 3,800 job cuts in

nearly \u00a311bn after slowing expansion</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Lidl</strong>\u2019s UK business has bounced back into profit after it slowed expansion in favour of improving existing stores, spurring a jump in sales to above \u00a39bn.</p> <p>The German-owned discounter, which is close to overtaking <strong>Morrisons</strong> to become the UK\u2019s fifth-largest supermarket, said it had gained more than 300,000 new shoppers and 60% of Britons visited the chain at least once year.</p> <p>Profits rebounded in the year to February as the group cut

      "bodyText": "Our two main stories today: Ford has said that it will cut 4,000 jobs in Europe, becoming the latest carmaker to seek to reduce costs amid slowing growth in electric car sales and competition from China. The American carmaker said on Wednesday it would cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 in Germany. The company\u2019s UK sites in Dagenham and Halewood will not be affected. The cuts represent about 14% of its 28,000 workforce in Europe and will be completed by the end of 2027. Ford is the latest in a series of global carmakers to aim for cost savings as the industry struggles with waning demand while also trying to invest in the transition to electric cars. Inflation increased to 2.3% in October, heaping pressure on the Bank of England to delay further interest rate cuts until next year. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Wednesday showed that a rise in energy bills pushed up the consumer prices index (CPI), reversing a downward trend this year in inflation, which was 1.7% in September. The figure for the year to October was slightly above the 2.2% City economists had expected. The ONS said higher gas and electricity prices were offset by lower oil prices, which reduced the transport and raw materials costs of manufacturing businesses. Falls in the price of theatre and live music tickets also helped to limit the fastest month-on-month increase in prices since October 2022, at 0.6%. Thank you for reading. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Take care! \u2013 JK Shares in UK housebuilders have fallen today, after UK inflation jumped more than expected, suggesting that the Bank of England will move cautiously in reducing borrowing costs. Inflation accelerated to 2.3% last month from 1.7% in September \u2013 taking it back above the Bank\u2019s target. Inflation in the services sector, which the central bank regards as a key measure of domestic price pressures, rose to 5% from 4.9%. The UK housebuilders\u2019 index fell by 3.4% with Vistry Group (formerly Bovis Homes) the biggest loser, with shares down 8.1%. Other FTSE 100 builders Berkeley Group, Persimmon, Barratt Redrow and Taylor Wimpey dropped by between 2.5% and 3%. Ford\u2019s UK sites in Dagenham and Halewood will not be affected, reports my colleague Jasper Jolly. Here\u2019s our full story: Ford has announced it will cut 4,000 jobs in Europe, mainly in Germany and the UK. This amounts to 14% of the American carmaker\u2019s European workforce. The layoffs will be made by the end of 2027. Globally, they represent around 2.3% of Ford\u2019s workforce of 174,000. The company blamed significant losses in recent years caused by weak demand for electric vehicles, a lack of government support for the shift to EVs, and growing competition. Ford is the latest carmaker after Nissan, Stellantis and General Motors to cut costs as the industry struggles with growing competition from Chinese rivals in Europe, waning demand in China, and the challenges of selling electric cars that are still too expensive for many people to buy. The European Union has imposed tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, which it says benefit from unfair subsidies from the Beijing government. Ford\u2019s move deals a big blow to Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy. Volkswagen is threatening to close factories, slash wages and cut thousands of jobs to improve its ability to compete. The country is also in political crisis, with a snap election in February, while companies grapple with growing trade tensions with China and the threat of US tariffs following Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election. Ford said Europe\u2019s automakers face significant competitive and economic headwinds while also tackling a misalignment between CO2 regulations and consumer demand for electrified vehicles. Ford\u2019s sales in Europe plunged by 17.9% in September, far outstripping an industrywide decline of 6.1%. Ford called on the German government to provide more incentives and better charging infrastructure to help consumers transition to EVs. Berlin ended EV subsidies in December last year, and sales of electric cars in Germany were down by 28.6% in the first nine months of this year. Ford\u2018s chief financial officer John Lawler wrote in a letter to the German government: What we lack in Europe and Germany is an unmistakable, clear policy agenda to advance e-mobility, such as public investments in charging infrastructure, meaningful incentives ... and greater flexibility in meeting CO2 compliance targets. Ford already announced 3,800 job cuts in Europe in February 2023. The company behind Tokyo\u2019s renowned metro system has won a deal to take over the operation of London\u2019s Elizabeth line, replacing the incumbent Chinese-owned operator MTR. Tokyo Metro Company (TMC) has promised to bring Japanese reliability and punctuality to London\u2019s newest rail line after its consortium with the UK transport group Go-Ahead and the Japanese trading house Sumitomo Corporation beat three other bidders for the deal. The GTS Rail Operations consortium will now take over the running of the line, which opened in 2022, for at least seven years from next May. MTR, which is three-quarters owned by the Hong Kong government and operates the transport network in the administrative region of China, won the deal to manage services on the Elizabeth line in 2014 when Boris Johnson was mayor. Dame Sharon White, the former chair of John Lewis, has been appointed as the European head of the Canadian public pension fund manager that holds investments in companies including Eurostar and Heathrow airport. White, who stepped down as John Lewis chair in September, has been given the official title of managing director and head of Europe at Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec (CDPQ) and will start in January. White, the shortest-serving chair in the history of the John Lewis Partnership, had been due to leave the retailer next February but stepped aside early to make way for former Tesco boss Jason Tarry. The announcement of White\u2019s decision to step down came a month after she announced that the group\u2019s turnaround would take two years longer than planned and cost more money. John Lewis ditched its annual staff bonus for the second time in three years in March last year, after the group slumped to a worse-than-expected \u00a3230m full-year loss. Her tenure had been mired in controversy including a reported plan to dilute its employee-owned mutual model by selling a stake in the business to raise more than \u00a31bn, which was shelved after she narrowly won a vote of confidence in which staff backed her to continue but expressed dismay at the retailer\u2019s poor performance. Lidl\u2019s UK business has bounced back into profit after it slowed expansion in favour of improving existing stores, spurring a jump in sales to above \u00a39bn. The German-owned discounter, which is close to overtaking Morrisons to become the UK\u2019s fifth-largest supermarket, said it had gained more than 300,000 new shoppers and 60% of Britons visited the chain at least once year. Profits rebounded in the year to February as the group cut back investment, opening just one net new store, according to the accounts, compared with 45 in the previous year. The company began slowing down the rate of new stores last year, after several years of frequent store openings. However, it plans to open 40 new outlets next year and 18 in the coming months. The energy regulator has ordered power supplier E.ON Next to pay \u00a314.5m in compensation to nearly 250,000 prepayment customers, after an investigation found \u201cunacceptable\u201d failures to pay credit they had on accounts or final bill payments they were owed. Ofgem found that the customers were affected over an 18-month period from early 2021 to late last year by an error in E.ON Next\u2019s billing system. About 100,000 of the affected accounts were also in credit. Prepayment customers who transferred to another supplier or terminated their contract did not receive final bills within the required six-week period, and the gas and electricity supplier subsequently failed to make the required compensation payments of \u00a330 or \u00a360. Because customers did not receive a final bill they were also unaware of any credit remaining on their accounts, worth an average of \u00a351 per affected customer. Here\u2019s our full analysis on the jump in UK inflation to 2.3%, back above the Bank of England\u2019s target, from 1.7% in September. Higher energy bills were the main culprit, while food inflation also rose. One of the UK\u2019s biggest pension funds has lost more than \u00a3350m on a series of \u201ccalamitous\u201d investments in incinerator power plants that are expected to go bust in the coming days. The Guardian understands that Aviva Investors will put three incinerators into administration this week after pouring millions of pounds into what has been described as the country\u2019s \u201cdirtiest form of power generation\u201d. Aviva\u2019s own accounts show that the three incinerator plants \u2013 in Hull in East Yorkshire, Boston in Lincolnshire and Barry in south Wales \u2013 accumulated loans totalling \u00a3480m from its investors between 2015 and 2023. Aviva has written off \u00a3368m for the plants, which were originally intended to run on biomass waste wood and later converted to burn household waste, but which struggled to reach their targets. HSBC is to launch its first UK \u201cwealth centre\u201d in London\u2019s Mayfair district, offering more personalised banking services and exclusive events such as wine tastings as part of a drive to win more rich customers. The lender will take up two floors of the 16-storey Smithson Tower at 25 St James\u2019s Street \u2013 close to the Ritz Hotel and Fortnum &amp; Mason department store \u2013 as part of a revamp of HSBC\u2019s premier-tier bank service. Aimed at the sought-after \u201cmass affluent\u201d market, premier is a tier below private-banking clients and is targeted at customers with \u00a3100,000 to \u00a32m in income, assets or deposits. The 8,000 sq ft wealth centre, which is due to open by summer 2025, will give premier clients access to a concierge team, catering services and a barista coffee bar, alongside 12 high-spec meeting rooms with panoramic views of London to meet HSBC team of dedicated relationship bankers. Santander UK has put aside \u00a3295m to cover potential payouts to car loan customers as the bank issued its first estimate of the financial fallout from the growing car loan mis-selling scandal. The figures were released alongside the bank\u2019s third-quarter results, which were delayed last month after a court of appeal ruling in October said it was unlawful for two lenders to have paid a \u201csecret\u201d commission to car dealers without borrowers\u2019 knowledge. The provision dented the bank\u2019s pre-tax profits, which fell to \u00a3143m in the quarter, down from \u00a3413m in the second quarter. Car lenders such as Santander UK had already been facing potential payouts over an Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) investigation into a specific type of commission payment, discretionary commission arrangements, that was banned in 2021. Policymakers have been \u201cleft in the dark\u201d by official jobs figures since the pandemic, which may have \u201clost\u201d almost a million workers according to the thinktank Resolution Foundation. In a report, the thinktank said the regular snapshot from the Office for National Statistics may have painted an \u201coverly pessimistic\u201d picture of the UK labour market since the pandemic. The thinktank\u2019s principal economist, Adam Corlett, says in the report that response rates to the key Labour Force Survey (LFS) have collapsed, from 39% in 2019 to just 13% last year. There are concerns that workers may be less likely to respond to the survey than people who are economically inactive, potentially skewing the results. Sterling rose after the higher-than-expected inflation figures were released, as did the yield \u2013 or interest rate \u2013 on government bonds. The pound rose as much as 0.25%, and is now marginally higher at $1.2687. Yields on two-year gilts, as UK government bonds are known, which are the most sensitive to interest rate expectations, rose more than 4 basis points to 4.456% and are now at 4.42%. Ten-year and 30-year gilt yields rose by a similar amount, which mirrored a similar move in US government bonds, Treasuries. Unite, the UK\u2019s biggest union, is calling for \u201cserious action\u201d to tackle the cost of living crisis. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: With inflation rising again, we need some serious action to tackle the root causes of the cost-of-living crisis. For a start, that means taking on the profiteers who have driven sky high prices and bringing the energy system back into public hands. Financial markets now see the probability of a rate cut at next month\u2019s Bank of England meeting at around 16%. The Bank\u2019s governor, Andrew Bailey, yesterday stressed that the central bank was pursing a \u201cgradual approach\u201d to reducing borrowing costs from their current level of 4.75%, allowing time to assess the impact of the tax changes in last month\u2019s budget. He said: A gradual approach to removing monetary policy restraint will help us to observe how this plays out, along with other risks to the inflation outlook. Here\u2019s some instant analysis from our new economics editor Heather Stewart, who has just taken over from Larry Elliott. She writes: Any lingering hope that the Bank of England might deliver a pre-Christmas interest rate cut next month appears to have evaporated, after official data showed inflation jumping to 2.3% in October. The CPI measure had been expected to tip up, after dipping to 1.7% in September, but 2.3% was stronger than expected. September\u2019s reading was the first time inflation had fallen been below the Bank\u2019s 2% target since July 2021, and looks likely to be the last for some time. Much of the explanation lies in energy prices, with Ofgem\u2019s price cap rising from October \u2013 in contrast to the same period last year, when utility bills were falling rapidly from the peak hit in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Electricity prices rose by 7.7% in October, the ONS said, having fallen by 7.5% last year. Gas prices increased by 11.7% in October, compared with a 7% drop last year. Economists were quick to suggest that the stronger-than-expected rise confirmed expectations that the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) will wait until the new year before going further, after cutting rates to 4.75% earlier this month. Donald Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House is also giving policymakers pause: if he presses ahead with across-the-board tariffs, the short-term impact at least is likely to be inflationary. The Conservatives have responded to the inflation figures. Mel Stride, shadow chancellor, said: Having brought inflation back down to target, we know how important it is for all of us that the government does the same. What is worrying about today\u2019s announcement is that inflation is running ahead of expectations and official forecasts state these figures are not expected to improve. Labour\u2019s budget will push up inflation and mortgage rates. And here is Monica George Michail, associate economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research: Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: Much of this overshoot in core inflation and services inflation was due to a sharp rise in airfares inflation, which the Bank won\u2019t consider a sign of stickier price pressures. Airfares inflation snapped back from -5.0% to +6.6%, partly due to the biggest monthly rise in airfares in October since monthly collection began in 2001. So just as some of the downside news on services inflation in September was due to volatile factors, some of the upside surprise in October looks like noise too. What\u2019s more, the Bank of England had expected services inflation to nudge up to 5.0% in October, so today\u2019s release won\u2019t be too much of a blow. Even so, October\u2019s data may mean that the rebound in CPI inflation over the coming months (due to unfavourable base effects in clothing, cars and recreation/culture) may take inflation further above the 2.7% we had been forecasting for January. That will strengthen the case for caution at the Bank of England. And it suggests that, barring a major downside surprise in November\u2019s inflation data, the Bank will almost certainly leave rates unchanged at 4.75% at its next meeting in December. The stronger than expected inflation figures dampened hopes of imminent interest rate cuts from the Bank of England. Services inflation \u2013 closely watched by the central bank \u2013 rose from 4.9% to 5%. Core inflation, which strips out volatile items like food and energy, also defied forecasters, rising from 3.2% to 3.3%. Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at abrdn, said: Headline inflation was always going to pop up again given energy price effects, but the slightly larger than expected increase reported today is somewhat disappointing. In particular, services inflation, which is closely watched by policymakers as a sign of underlying inflation pressures, was stronger and still well above an inflation-target consistent rate, albeit broadly in line with the Bank of England\u2019s forecasts. Headline inflation is likely to drift further above target for the next few months, but it is the fundamental determinants of inflation that will determine the path of interest rates from here. And with the budget set to boost growth and inflation next year, there is little reason for the Bank to deviate from its only gradual rate cutting schedule any time soon. So we continue to expect the next rate cut early next year. Simon French, chief economist and head of research at investment bank Panmure Liberum, said on X: Food price inflation edged higher to 1.9% from 1.8% in September, well down from the recent peak of 19.2% in March 2023, which was the highest annual ate for over 45 years. Treasury chief secretary Darren Jones acknowledged there was \u201cmore to do\u201d to ease cost of living pressure, as inflation increased to 2.3% in October from 1.7% in September. Jones said: We know that families across Britain are still struggling with the cost of living. That is why the budget last month focused on fixing the foundation of our economy so we can deliver change. That includes boosting the national minimum wage, freezing fuel duty and protecting working people\u2019s payslips from higher taxes. But we know there is more to do. That is why the government is focused on economic growth and investment so we can make every part of the country better off. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Inflation in the UK picked up more than expected last month because of higher electricity and gas prices. The consumer prices index rose at an annual rate of 2.3% in October, up from 1.7% in September. Economists had expected a rate of 2.2%. Electricity prices rose by 7.7% in October, having fallen by 7.5% last year. Gas prices increased by 11.7% in October, compared with a 7% drop last year. The energy price cap went up, and Ofgem, the regulator, estimates that for an average household paying by direct debit for dual fuel, this equates to \u00a31,717, a rise of \u00a3149 on an annual bill.

      "body": "<p>Much like Christmas is a lot less enjoyable for the person who has to organise all the presents and cook the dinner, game-of-the-year season is rather intimidating for the people who have to put together the shortlists. Every November, I tot up all of the year\u2019s acclaimed games I\u2019ve yet to play, the underground recommendations I\u2019ve yet to follow up on and the games I loved back in February but forgot about. I feel a mounting panic. And when all of the year-end lists come out, I inevitably find I\u2019ve missed something anyway.</p> <p>The Game Awards have just announced the nominations for this year\u2019s ceremony, taking place on 12 December in Los Angeles. (Disclosure: the Guardian is one of 130 voting outlets for the awards, but my knowledge and involvement with them is limited to sending Geoff Keighley our ballots every year, usually a day or two late. Sorry, Geoff.) There are few surprises in the nominations, but I am pleased that one of the top two most nominated games is Astro Bot, with seven nominations, a game that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/sep/05/astro-bot-review-team-asobi-playstation-5-team-asobi-sony\">cannot get enough praise</a> as far as I\u2019m concerned.

      "bodyText": "Much like Christmas is a lot less enjoyable for the person who has to organise all the presents and cook the dinner, game-of-the-year season is rather intimidating for the people who have to put together the shortlists. Every November, I tot up all of the year\u2019s acclaimed games I\u2019ve yet to play, the underground recommendations I\u2019ve yet to follow up on and the games I loved back in February but forgot about. I feel a mounting panic. And when all of the year-end lists come out, I inevitably find I\u2019ve missed something anyway. The Game Awards have just announced the nominations for this year\u2019s ceremony, taking place on 12 December in Los Angeles. (Disclosure: the Guardian is one of 130 voting outlets for the awards, but my knowledge and involvement with them is limited to sending Geoff Keighley our ballots every year, usually a day or two late. Sorry, Geoff.) There are few surprises in the nominations, but I am pleased that one of the top two most nominated games is Astro Bot, with seven nominations, a game that cannot get enough praise as far as I\u2019m concerned. (The other is Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, up for six awards, which our critic dubbed a miracle of fan service; alas, I remain immune to the charms of Final Fantasy despite many attempts over the years to get into it). The other nominees for game of the year are Balatro, the ludicrously compulsive card game that took over my life in January; Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, the expansion to the 2022 action role-playing masterpiece; Metaphor: ReFantazio, the wildly stylish Atlus RPG that I wrote about a few weeks back; and Black Myth: Wukong, an enormous hit this summer, despite significant controversy around its development and release. This is a close competition, but my money is on Shadow of the Erdtree for the grand prize, because that game is especially beloved by game critics \u2013 although I\u2019d be delighted if Astro Bot wins.

Indika is a bleakly fascinating horror-ish game about a 19th-century nun that takes a swipe at the Russian Orthodox church; Hellblade II, like its predecessor, portrays its lead character\u2019s struggles with psychosis; Tales of Kenzera: Zau is about grief and draws from its creator\u2019s African heritage; Closer the Distance is also about grief; Neva could, I suppose, be interpreted as environmentalist, and also has a smattering of loss in there.

      "body": "<p>Samantha Harvey\u2019s Booker-winning Orbital has rocketed to the top of the UK bestseller chart, becoming the first Booker novel to hit number one in the week of its win.</p> <p>20,040 copies were sold in the UK last week across paperback and hardback editions, according to Nielsen BookData.</p> <p>Orbital, which narrates a day in the life of six astronauts on the International Space Station, was announced as the winner of the \u00a350,000 prize last Tuesday evening.</p>    <p>Day one sales \u201ceclipsed all recent winners, selling considerably more than double the volume of each of the last decade\u2019s winners\u201d at Waterstones, said its head of books Bea Carvalho.</p> <p>Sales of Orbital across the chain\u2019s stores increased nearly 3,000% between last Tuesday and Wednesday, with demand growing throughout the week. \u201cAt this stage, sales suggest that like for like it will be the bestselling Booker prize winner through Waterstones,\u201d Carvalho said.</p> <p>Independent bookshops have also seen high demand for Harvey\u2019s fifth novel. Alex Forbes, who owns Fourbears Books in Reading, said that he thinks Orbital being out in paperback has helped sales, with \u201cmany people saying that they wanted to read other titles on the shortlist but don\u2019t want hardbacks\u201d. Of the shortlist, only Orbital and Anne Michaels\u2019 Held are out in paperback.</p> <p>The specific genre and style of Orbital may also be drawing in readers. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a story of humanity and the fragility of human life, but it\u2019s not as common for books to make these observations from space, which attracts the readers who enjoy genre fiction as well as those who stick to literary books,\u201d said Forbes.</p> <p>It \u201cappeals as much to gritty realism lovers like me as to sci-fi nuts,\u201d agreed Tom Rowley, who owns independent bookshop Backstory in Balham London. \u201cMy main job between now and Christmas is just going to be pressing the reorder button.\u201d</p> <p>The length of the book may also be a contributing factor to its commercial success \u2013 at 136 pages, Orbital is the second-shortest book to win the Booker in the prize\u2019s history, running to four pages longer than Offshore by Penelope Fitzgerald, which won in 1979. Orbital is \u201cslim enough for us to persuade even the most Booker-averse customer to give it a go\u201d, said Rowley. Its brevity also appeals as it \u201cseems manageable when people potentially have busy lives\u201d, said Forbes.</p> <p>Since its release in November last year, Orbital has sold 54,212 copies across hardback and paperback editions.</p> <p>Today, it was announced that the book has been longlisted for the inaugural Climate fiction prize, worth \u00a310,000.

      "bodyText": "Samantha Harvey\u2019s Booker-winning Orbital has rocketed to the top of the UK bestseller chart, becoming the first Booker novel to hit number one in the week of its win. 20,040 copies were sold in the UK last week across paperback and hardback editions, according to Nielsen BookData. Orbital, which narrates a day in the life of six astronauts on the International Space Station, was announced as the winner of the \u00a350,000 prize last Tuesday evening. Day one sales \u201ceclipsed all recent winners, selling considerably more than double the volume of each of the last decade\u2019s winners\u201d at Waterstones, said its head of books Bea Carvalho. Sales of Orbital across the chain\u2019s stores increased nearly 3,000% between last Tuesday and Wednesday, with demand growing throughout the week. \u201cAt this stage, sales suggest that like for like it will be the bestselling Booker prize winner through Waterstones,\u201d Carvalho said. Independent bookshops have also seen high demand for Harvey\u2019s fifth novel. Alex Forbes, who owns Fourbears Books in Reading, said that he thinks Orbital being out in paperback has helped sales, with \u201cmany people saying that they wanted to read other titles on the shortlist but don\u2019t want hardbacks\u201d. Of the shortlist, only Orbital and Anne Michaels\u2019 Held are out in paperback. The specific genre and style of Orbital may also be drawing in readers. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a story of humanity and the fragility of human life, but it\u2019s not as common for books to make these observations from space, which attracts the readers who enjoy genre fiction as well as those who stick to literary books,\u201d said Forbes. It \u201cappeals as much to gritty realism lovers like me as to sci-fi nuts,\u201d agreed Tom Rowley, who owns independent bookshop Backstory in Balham London. \u201cMy main job between now and Christmas is just going to be pressing the reorder button.\u201d The length of the book may also be a contributing factor to its commercial success \u2013 at 136 pages, Orbital is the second-shortest book to win the Booker in the prize\u2019s history, running to four pages longer than Offshore by Penelope Fitzgerald, which won in 1979. Orbital is \u201cslim enough for us to persuade even the most Booker-averse customer to give it a go\u201d, said Rowley. Its brevity also appeals as it \u201cseems manageable when people potentially have busy lives\u201d, said Forbes. Since its release in November last year, Orbital has sold 54,212 copies across hardback and paperback editions. Today, it was announced that the book has been longlisted for the inaugural Climate fiction prize, worth \u00a310,000. The shortlist will be announced on 19 March. \u201cIt has been joyous to see Samantha Harvey and her Booker win celebrated euphorically by everyone within the books ecosystem and especially booksellers who have been championing Orbital from the very start,\u201d said Hannah Telfer, managing director of Penguin imprint Vintage, which publishes Orbital.

Anger and betrayal over the policy bubbled into a powerful resistance, galvanising a generation of young Latinos and immigrants \u2013 Montoya among them \u2013 to action. For more than a decade, they fought to tear down the law and vote out its strongest proponents. They protested in the streets, and fought in the courts.

The state legislature has not provided any additional funding to the law enforcement who would be deputised with enforcing immigration policy. Some sheriffs have also said it would encourage racial profiling.</p> <p>David Hathaway, the sheriff of Santa Cruz county, just south of Tucson, said that the law relies on a \u201cracist\u201d mechanism, encouraging officers to stop anyone who looks like a migrant.

When legal manoeuvres stalled or failed, it had become common practice for activists in Phoenix to rally supporters to stage protests against the arrests and deportation of community members. \u201cWe have to be unafraid, not timid, when it comes to resistance towards the Trump administration or bad policies like Prop 314,\u201d said Fierros.</p>",

That could be fruitless, in a county where 40,000 out of 49,000 residents identify as Hispanic or Latino, and 78% speak Spanish at home. \u201cIt would be ridiculous for me to go up to practically every single person in my county and say: \u2018Let me see your papers, I need to check your immigration status,\u2019\u201d Hathaway told the Guardian in September. Human rights and immigration groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, have vowed to continue fighting Proposition 314 and prevent its full implementation. \u201cArizona\u2019s original \u2018show me your papers\u2019 law was held to be largely unconstitutional by the US supreme court in 2012. Our state has been down this road before with costly litigation,\u201d John Mitchell, an immigrants\u2019 rights attorney for the ACLU of Arizona, said in a statement. At the same time, advocates are scrambling to prepare to react to the law, and are bracing for more round-ups and ramped-up threats against immigrants as Trump moves to implement his plans for mass deportations. The progressive group Lucha, for example \u2013 which knocked on hundreds of thousands of doors ahead of the election urging people to vote for Kamala Harris and against Proposition 314 \u2013 has now kicked its immigrant education program into high gear. \u201cWe want to make sure we\u2019re educating the community about what will be coming down the line,\u201d said C\u00e9sar Fierros, a communications director at Lucha. The group\u2019s immigrant services department has been urging community members who are eligible to apply for green cards, renew their visas and make sure paperwork is up to date before Trump is sworn into office. Activists and advocates have also redoubled efforts to share information about legal resources for those fighting deportation, drawing on lessons learned from Trump\u2019s first term, and from the years that Arpaio and SB1070 reigned. When legal manoeuvres stalled or failed, it had become common practice for activists in Phoenix to rally supporters to stage protests against the arrests and deportation of community members. \u201cWe have to be unafraid, not timid, when it comes to resistance towards the Trump administration or bad policies like Prop 314,\u201d said Fierros.",

Payne died aged 31 after falling from a third-floor hotel balcony in Argentina last month, prompting an outpouring of grief from fans across the world. His former bandmates, Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson, were among those seen attending the private funeral in Buckinghamshire on Wednesday. Styles arrived alongside the TV star James Corden, while Cowell arrived with his fiancee, Lauren Silverman. A horse-drawn carriage carried a dark blue coffin topped with white roses, as well as a red floral tribute, which said \u201cSon\u201d and a blue tribute, which said \u201cDaddy\u201d, to St Mary\u2019s Church in Amersham. Payne shared a seven-year-old son, Bear, with the singer Cheryl Tweedy, who attended the funeral along with her Girls Aloud bandmates Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh. Before his death Payne lived in the south-east Buckinghamshire village of Chalfont St Giles, close to his former partner and their son. Other guests included Payne\u2019s girlfriend, the US influencer Kate Cassidy, who arrived alongside Damian Hurley, son of the model Elizabeth Hurley, as well as the This Morning presenter Rochelle Humes and her husband, the former JLS singer Marvin Humes. Silence fell among the crowd of fans, some holding photographs and flowers, who gathered outside as Payne\u2019s father, Geoff, and his mother, Karen, arrived and stood next to the carriage. Another floral tribute depicted bowling pins being knocked over by a ball in reference to one of Payne\u2019s favourite pastimes. Payne rose to fame in 2010 after appearing as a contestant on the ITV talent show The X-Factor as part of One Direction, which went on to become one of the bestselling boybands of all time. One Direction had a hiatus in 2016. Payne launched his solo career, releasing his debut solo album LP1 in December 2019. The singer died on 16 October after falling from a balcony at the CasaSur hotel in Buenos Aires, with an autopsy concluding he had died of multiple traumas and internal and external bleeding. Fans around the world have held vigils in his memory, as well as creating a shrine to him in his home town of Wolverhampton.

More than that, it\u2019s an affront to our most basic, foundational principles of human dignity.\u201d In September, a report from the homeland security department\u2019s office of the inspector general, following a surprise visit, noted a number of deficiencies at Baker, including violations of use-of-force standards and failing to maintain a log of detainee requests. The homeland security department\u2019s office for civil rights and civil liberties acknowledged \u201cimmediate concerns regarding the health and well-being of persons detained at Baker\u201d in a March letter to the ACLU of Florida. \u201cWe cannot allow a government-run facility to treat people with such deliberate contempt and predatory behavior,\u201d said Amy Godshall, the advocacy group\u2019s legal fellow and immigrants\u2019 rights attorney. \u201cBaker has let xenophobia and misogyny run rampant at its facility for far too long, and has curated an abusive and unlivable environment for immigrants. It is an affront to human decency, and such state-sanctioned abuse is unacceptable.\u201d Maxwell Frost, the Democratic Florida representative, who sits on the House oversight committee, said he had witnessed \u201cinhumane\u201d conditions during an unannounced visit to Baker in recent weeks, and wants the facility closed down. \u201cWhat I saw was just some of the worst conditions of living I\u2019ve ever seen. They\u2019re not getting enough food, or the food they\u2019re getting is completely disgusting,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of women end up getting urinary tract infections because the undergarments they\u2019re given are shared; there are flies and mold. It\u2019s not in accordance with the way the federal government should be running any sort of facility. But also it\u2019s completely inhumane to treat other humans this way.\u201d Dick Durbin, the Illinois Democrat and chair of the Senate judiciary committee that received the whistleblower complaint, called for the Government Accountability Office to look into mental health care at Ice detention facilities. \u201cWith the incoming Trump-Vance administration signaling plans for a vengeful campaign targeting migrants and a drastic expansion of detention facilities, we must quickly ensure oversight and accountability,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cReal, enforceable measures are necessary to ensure detainees do not face unnecessary harm and suffering.\u201d In a statement, a spokesperson said Ice \u201cwill not comment on litigation proceedings or outcomes\u201d, but insisted that \u201cat no time during detention will a detainee be denied emergent care\u201d. \u201cUS Immigration and Customs and Enforcement is committed to ensuring that all in its custody reside in a safe, secure and humane environment under appropriate conditions of confinement,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe agency takes allegations of misconduct very seriously \u2013 personnel are held to the highest standards of professional and ethical behavior. All allegations of abuse or other misconduct are investigated. If any such allegations are substantiated, appropriate action is taken.\u201d The spokesperson said Ice encourages the reporting of allegations of misconduct through a toll-free detention reporting and information line. The Baker county sheriff\u2019s office has not responded to a request for comment.",

These outages cause price spikes, which in turn flow through to consumer bills over time.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Ukraine war has also played a role, triggering broader price increases that have taken years to fully reflect in consumer electricity costs.\u201d</p> \n<p>But what about renewables? Have they increased costs?</p> \n<p>The statement added: \u201cThe increasing share of renewable energy in the generation mix has put downward pressure on electricity prices and emissions, but it\u2019s important to consider that the higher costs in recent years have largely been driven by volatility in the wholesale market.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Wholesale costs</h2> \n<p>Uhlmann <a href=\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/reality-bites-prime-ministers-promise-of-cheap-renewable-energy-as-payday-killer-bills-belt-aussie-households/news-story/8980bfa55c790caf9ddfd0657edeff69\">wrote that renewables would mean higher costs because</a> when solar and wind are not generating much power, the gaps will be filled \u201cwith higher-coast alternatives like gas, hydro power and batteries\u201d.</p> \n<p>Because, he claimed, the highest cost of generation sets the wholesale price in the electricity market, the Albanese government\u2019s pledge to lower bills (scuppered significantly by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine) had failed.</p> \n<p>Dr Dylan McConnell, an energy systems expert at the University of New South Wales, said the electricity market did not always choose the most expensive forms of electricity to set the price.</p> \n<p>Instead, he said the market operator selects the lowest cost combination of generators to meet demand, with the price set by the last generator needed.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo at different times, if there\u2019s a lot of renewable energy for example, it might be solar and wind setting the price,\u201d he said. \u201cGas does set the price occasionally, but the most common price setter is actually hydro.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou can see this pretty easily these days. In the middle of the day we often see negative pricing [because of abundant solar and wind] but in the evening the price is higher when we have to call on more expensive generators like coal or gas.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat is an argument for having alternatives [to coal and gas], rather than needing more of them.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Dirty secret?</h2> \n<p>Uhlmann claimed there was a \u201cdirty little secret\u201d in the Australian Energy Market Operator\u2019s blueprint for a system free from coal \u2013 that secret being gas.</p> \n<p>According to Uhlmann, the blueprint\u2019s call for 15GW of gas-fired power by 2050 shows renewables \u201ccannot form a reliable electricity system without gas\u201d (which, self-evidently, is not the plan anyway).</p> \n<p>Uhlmann <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/inquirer/the-astonishing-cost-of-our-netzero-delusion/news-story/3fc40d39e4c55ce263ac811255f91bc9\">claimed the role of gas</a> \u201cis more backbone than backstop\u201d and said the amount of gas capacity would be enough to power 15m homes.</p> \n<p>Except the same blueprint document (known as the Integrated System Plan) says in the future a \u201ctypical gas generator may generate just 5% of its annual potential, but will be critical when it runs.\u201d</p> \n<p>Not much of a \u201cbackbone\u201d if it\u2019s only being used 5% of the time.</p> \n<h2>Alternative plan</h2> \n<p>The only alternatives offered in the doco come in visits to a nuclear power plant and a coal plant with carbon capture and storage, both in the United States.</p> \n<p>Nuclear power, which is prohibited in Australia, would require the Coalition to win government and most experts say the technology is unlikely to provide any electricity before 2040.

      "bodyText": "What is \u201cThe Real Cost of Net Zero\u201d the political journalist Chris Uhlmann asked this week, after weeks of trailing his new documentary on Sky News Australia. Uhlmann is no fan of Australia\u2019s shift to renewables and, in a preview published in the Australian said politicians and governments \u201cpushing ambitious renewables targets\u201d were \u201cbreathtakingly, stunningly energy illiterate\u201d. With hubris like that, the hour-long doco had a lot to live up to. In a foreboding opener, the former ABC and Nine journalist told viewers: \u201cAs power costs soar, weather-dependent electricity generation is being found wanting.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email But is it? And do renewables actually have anything to do with the rising costs of electricity for Australians? Perhaps the biggest hint of which constituency would have enjoyed Uhlmann\u2019s documentary the most came in an advertisement that ran straight after, from the advocacy group Coal Australia. Payday killer? Featured in the doco is a Canberra resident, Belinda Jones, who shows Uhlmann her $1,073 electricity bill which left her only $71 left from her $1,144 pension \u2013 a \u201cpayday killer\u201d, she said. The story was recounted in the Australian and the Daily Telegraph. That is a high bill and it may have been tough for that woman until her next pension payment arrived in 14 days. Another power bill, however, wouldn\u2019t have appeared for three months. That context was missing from the stories. \u201cEnergy rationing is already a reality,\u201d said Uhlmann, commenting on Jones\u2019s situation. But while conservatives consistently blame renewables for rising electricity prices, there is little evidence to support the claim. The director of climate change and energy at the industry association Ai Group, Tennant Reed, said in the last 15 years, prices had gone up due to over-investment in the electricity network in the early 2010s, and then rising international gas prices, followed by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine that pushed up coal and gas costs. A spokesperson for the Australian Energy Market Operator said in the last decade, the primary drivers of rising electricity costs for consumers were \u201cmarket volatility and supply disruptions\u201d. \u201cKey factors include transmission and generation outages, especially those affecting large coal-fired power stations. These outages cause price spikes, which in turn flow through to consumer bills over time. \u201cThe Ukraine war has also played a role, triggering broader price increases that have taken years to fully reflect in consumer electricity costs.\u201d But what about renewables? Have they increased costs? The statement added: \u201cThe increasing share of renewable energy in the generation mix has put downward pressure on electricity prices and emissions, but it\u2019s important to consider that the higher costs in recent years have largely been driven by volatility in the wholesale market.\u201d Wholesale costs Uhlmann wrote that renewables would mean higher costs because when solar and wind are not generating much power, the gaps will be filled \u201cwith higher-coast alternatives like gas, hydro power and batteries\u201d. Because, he claimed, the highest cost of generation sets the wholesale price in the electricity market, the Albanese government\u2019s pledge to lower bills (scuppered significantly by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine) had failed. Dr Dylan McConnell, an energy systems expert at the University of New South Wales, said the electricity market did not always choose the most expensive forms of electricity to set the price. Instead, he said the market operator selects the lowest cost combination of generators to meet demand, with the price set by the last generator needed. \u201cSo at different times, if there\u2019s a lot of renewable energy for example, it might be solar and wind setting the price,\u201d he said. \u201cGas does set the price occasionally, but the most common price setter is actually hydro. \u201cYou can see this pretty easily these days. In the middle of the day we often see negative pricing [because of abundant solar and wind] but in the evening the price is higher when we have to call on more expensive generators like coal or gas. \u201cThat is an argument for having alternatives [to coal and gas], rather than needing more of them.\u201d Dirty secret? Uhlmann claimed there was a \u201cdirty little secret\u201d in the Australian Energy Market Operator\u2019s blueprint for a system free from coal \u2013 that secret being gas. According to Uhlmann, the blueprint\u2019s call for 15GW of gas-fired power by 2050 shows renewables \u201ccannot form a reliable electricity system without gas\u201d (which, self-evidently, is not the plan anyway). Uhlmann claimed the role of gas \u201cis more backbone than backstop\u201d and said the amount of gas capacity would be enough to power 15m homes. Except the same blueprint document (known as the Integrated System Plan) says in the future a \u201ctypical gas generator may generate just 5% of its annual potential, but will be critical when it runs.\u201d Not much of a \u201cbackbone\u201d if it\u2019s only being used 5% of the time. Alternative plan The only alternatives offered in the doco come in visits to a nuclear power plant and a coal plant with carbon capture and storage, both in the United States. Nuclear power, which is prohibited in Australia, would require the Coalition to win government and most experts say the technology is unlikely to provide any electricity before 2040. So there\u2019s little chance of that offering a solution in the foreseeable future. There are only four CCS projects attached to power plants now operating anywhere in the world, two of which are in China. In Australia the CSIRO estimates gas or coal with CCS would have the highest cost range of all legal generating technologies. Carbon capture? Uhlmann visited the Petra Nova project near Houston where CO2 is captured from a coal plant. Not mentioned in the documentary was how the project was forced to close in 2020 (it restarted in September 2023) after the oil price collapsed during the pandemic. Why would the collapse in the oil price affect a coal plant? Because the CO2 captured at Petra Nova was being injected into an oilfield to push out more crude to sell. In its first three years, Petra Nova stored 3.5Mt of CO2 in the oilfield but pushed out 4.2m barrels of oil (one typical barrel of oil releases roughly 400kg of CO2 when burned). Fracking cuts emissions In one interview on Sky, Uhlmann celebrated Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of the fracking executive Chris Wright to be his energy secretary. \u201cFor those that worry about climate change, by the way,\u201d Uhlmann said, \u201cthe biggest reduction in the last 15 years of CO2 into the atmosphere\u201d had come from the US, \u201cwhich replaced coal with natural gas\u201d after a fracking revolution. But that\u2019s not the only thing that has been happening to the US electricity sector. A congressional budget office report in 2022 said that since 2005, wind and solar had gone from providing 1% of electricity generation to 13%. US government data shows that between 2018 and 2023, switching from fossil fuels to renewables saved an average of 380 Mt CO2 a year, compared with 570Mt by moving from coal to gas. Crucial though are the emissions from methane leaks from gas wells, not counted in the data, which some studies estimate could greatly reduce any climate benefits, or even cancel them out entirely, of swapping coal for gas. Give coal a chance? In a page one splash in the Australian on Monday, a headline read \u201cGive coal a chance to rein in energy risks\u201d. The story claimed \u201cone of the world\u2019s major miners has urged the Albanese government to slow down the transition from coal to renewables,\u201d quoting Gary Nagle, the boss of Swiss mining company Glencore. Nagle told the newspaper the transition to renewable energy \u201cis not going to happen overnight\u201d and said \u201cmany countries have accepted coal as a shorter term transition fuel\u201d. So now, to transition away from coal, we should be using \u2026 more coal? If you think that doesn\u2019t make sense, you\u2019re probably not alone.

      "bodyText": "Santander UK has put aside \u00a3295m to cover potential payouts to car loan customers as the bank issued its first estimate of the financial fallout from the growing car loan mis-selling scandal. The figures were released alongside the bank\u2019s third-quarter results, which were delayed last month after a court of appeal ruling said it was unlawful for two lenders to have paid a \u201csecret\u201d commission to car dealers without borrowers\u2019 knowledge. The provision dented the bank\u2019s pre-tax profits, which fell to \u00a3143m in the quarter, down from \u00a3413m in the second quarter. Car lenders such as Santander UK had already been facing potential payouts over a Financial Conduct Authority investigation into a specific type of commission payment, discretionary commission arrangements,that was banned in 2021. However, the court judgment went beyond the scope of the FCA investigation and City regulation, extending into common law and opening the door to a much larger compensation bill for motor loan providers. Close Brothers and FirstRand, which owns the MotoNovo brand, have said they plan to appeal against the ruling in the supreme court. Filings are due by this Friday. Analysts at RBC had previously estimated that the FCA investigation and court judgment could together end up costing Santander up to \u00a31.4bn. Lloyds, which put aside \u00a3450m this year, is expected to be left with a \u00a33.2bn bill, Barclays \u00a3400m and Close Brothers \u00a3320m. Estimates of the total cost of compensation vary significantly, with the credit rating agency Moody\u2019s suggesting that it could go as high as \u00a330bn, the highest figure so far. Large-scale lenders such as Lloyds, Barclays and Santander are financially able to absorb potential costs, said Moody\u2019s. But smaller firms, including Close Brothers, Aldermore, Investec and the financing arms of Ford and Volkswagen, are facing a \u201cmore significant hit to earnings and capitalisation\u201d, it added. The rising estimates of the potential total costs have reignited speculation that it may be another payment protection insurance scandal in the making, which led to banks paying out nearly \u00a350bn over more than a decade. This year Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the FCA, said he did not see the car loan mis-selling scandal \u201cplaying out as PPI did\u201d. \u201cNot least because we have intervened early in the interests of market orderliness,\u201d he told a finance conference in London in March. Lenders have been scrambling to adapt to the court ruling and assess their position. Close Brothers and First Rand have temporarily halted new business in the UK, and Lloyds has scrapped all commission payments across its \u00a315bn Black Horse car division. Santander UK had originally been due to issue third-quarter results on 29 October, alongside its Spanish parent, Banco Santander, but delayed the release to give it more time to review the court of appeal ruling.

      "bodyText": "As pollen counts increase in parts of Australia throughout spring and summer, so too do the number of social media posts spruiking the benefits of locally sourced honey to alleviate hay fever symptoms. On TikTok, influencers claim raw honey is \u201csuper effective\u201d at building resistance to hay fever or even stopping hay fever for ever, while some honey sellers claim their products can help people remain \u201cantihistamine free\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate hay fever hack,\u201d one producer claimed in a Facebook post. Kira Hughes, a research scientist and site manager at Deakin University\u2019s AIRwatch pollen counting facility, says she has noticed a rise in misinformation surrounding alternative treatments for hay fever, and among those being \u201cheavily pushed\u201d is honey. It prompted the airborne allergen researcher to take a deep dive into the science behind the claims. But first, she says it\u2019s important to understand how hay fever develops. What causes hay fever? In Australia the most common hay fever trigger is pollen from grasses. Also called allergic rhinitis, it occurs when particles of the irritant \u2013 which can also include dust mites, animal dander or moulds \u2013 are breathed in. If the immune system perceives these particles as harmful, it will produce immunoglobulin E antibodies, according Prof Jo Douglass, a specialist physician in respiratory medicine and allergic disease. This in turn releases chemicals including histamine into the blood, which usually helps to protect against invaders like parasites. But an overreaction of the immune system to harmless invaders may produce too much histamine, causing sneezing, itchiness, red and watery eyes, and other uncomfortable symptoms, says Douglass, who heads the University of Melbourne\u2019s Medical School. In parts of south-east Australia, where a mix of converging environmental factors are more likely to occur all at once, including high ryegrass pollen counts, pollen is swept into the air during windy thunderstorms and the moisture in the wind combined with high wind power causes the pollen to rupture into smaller pieces. These tiny fragments are then able to penetrate more deeply beyond the eyes, nose and throat, and get into the lungs, triggering more serious symptoms such as asthma, a phenomenon referred to as \u201cthunderstorm asthma\u201d. Those who advocate that local honey can treat hay fever or prevent thunderstorm asthma believe that because local, unprocessed honey may contain small amounts of pollen collected by bees, ingesting this honey could gradually desensitise the immune system, working as a kind of immunotherapy that allows the body to get used to the allergen over time. But Hughes says bees are pretty selective. \u201cIn Australia all of our allergenic pollen comes from trees and grasses, which bees barely come into contact with,\u201d she says. Douglass adds: \u201cGrasses are wind pollinated, and that includes ryegrass, which is the big offender when it comes to allergies and also thunderstorm asthma.\u201d So it\u2019s unlikely any of the allergen makes it into the honey at all, they say. What does the evidence say about honey? A respiratory physician and adviser to Asthma Australia, Dr John Blakey, says desensitisation therapy for asthma \u201cisn\u2019t particularly effective\u201d. \u201cNo asthma guidelines say, \u2018If you\u2019re allergic to grass, get yourself desensitised and that will fix your asthma.\u2019 There is not the robust evidence that it\u2019s more effective than other standard treatments.\u201d He says such desensitisation therapy should also only be done with specialist medical supervision. Hughes says the evidence from scientific studies that claim locally sourced honey can treat hay fever is also weak. One of the studies used honey in conjunction with the antihistamine medication loratadine, commonly sold as Claratyne. \u201cThe honey was never tested as effective on its own,\u201d she says. A systematic review \u2013 a type of scientific study that examines all of the research on a specific topic \u2013 found the existing research on honey and allergic rhinitis had contradictory results and limitations in experiment design, and produced poor quality evidence. \u201cOverall, local honey was not better than a placebo and only a weak claim could be made that honey could be used in addition \u2013 and not instead of \u2013 allergy medication,\u201d Hughes says. She doesn\u2019t want to see a situation where \u201cpeople think that they can replace their normal medication with honey\u201d. The worst thunderstorm asthma event to date in Australia in 2016 caused 10 deaths, and 87% of the more than 3,500 people who presented with thunderstorm asthma had hay fever. \u201cPeople may leave themselves at really high risk on high pollen days, including of thunderstorm asthma, if they don\u2019t have the correct medication to take or a plan in place because they\u2019ve decided to use honey instead,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a dangerous rhetoric that has been spread by some of these honey businesses who see it as a clever marketing strategy to convince people antihistamines are as effective, if not better, than medications.\u201d What do the experts recommend instead? Blakey says anyone who believes their treatments are no longer working should ensure they are taking their preventive medications properly; speak to their doctor about other medicines to try; and check their symptoms are in fact being caused by an allergen.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s $230bn sovereign wealth fund will be retooled to help build houses, improve infrastructure and combat global heating under a new investment mandate. The Albanese government has announced that the independently managed Future Fund will get a new investment mandate and statement of expectations, the latter of which is the first update for the financial asset fund in 15 years. Under the changes, the fund will have to consider national priorities including increasing the domestic supply of residential housing, continuing to support the energy transition as part of the net zero transformation of the Australian economy, and delivering improved local infrastructure including economic resilience and security infrastructure. The government is hoping a greater certainty of investment in assets that have long-term benefits will encourage more supply of housing and clean energy projects. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Greg Combet, the chair of the Future Fund board of guardians, said it would appoint a new executive director responsible for the energy transition in response to the changes. \u201cWe have also long recognised the importance of environmental, social and governance issues in our investment process and will add resources in this area,\u201d he said. Established in 2006 by the Howard government, the Future Fund has $230bn under management, making it the government\u2019s largest financial asset. It is expected to grow to $380bn by 2032-33, with a benchmark for growth of returns of 4% to 5% above inflation over the long term. In a joint statement the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, and the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, said the changes \u201cwill mean more investment where we need it most but not at the expense of returns\u201d. \u201cThe government is also confirming the fund\u2019s enduring role in strengthening the commonwealth\u2019s long-term financial position and covering unfunded superannuation liabilities,\u201d they said. \u201cTo support this, the government won\u2019t start any drawdowns from the fund until at least 2032-33, providing the fund the certainty it needs to continue to build its portfolio. \u201cThe government remains committed to the fund\u2019s independence and commercial focus.\u201d They added that the fund\u2019s primary objective would continue to be to maximise returns, there was no change to the benchmark growth rate and \u201cthere will be no change to the expected risk profile\u201d. The Future Fund board of guardians welcomed the announcement, which it said provided the foundation for it \u201cto be an enduring institution able to invest for the long term, and at the same time further strengthen the nation\u2019s balance sheet\u201d. Combet, who began his term as board chair in June, said the policies \u201care an endorsement of the work that the Future Fund has done over 18 years to deliver its demanding investment mandate\u201d. \u201cThe government\u2019s decision to defer withdrawals from the Future Fund until at least 2032-33 provides the Future Fund with the confidence to provide more focus and resources to the areas of national priority identified in the new investment mandate that align with our risk and return hurdle. \u201cThe priority areas are aligned with the Future Fund\u2019s thinking \u2026 and consistent with its investment focus on seeking more local currency exposure and protection against sustained higher inflation.\u201d The Future Fund has invested in Tilt Renewables, a provider of 1.8GW of power from wind, solar and battery storage projects, in a third runway at Melbourne airport, and in a terminal and runway at Perth airport.",

Shein has experienced customer growth of 34% in the same period, with an estimated $1.1bn in annual sales. Both companies <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/15/business/economy/china-business-tiktok-shein.html\">have ties to China</a> and a network of Chinese suppliers that have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/23/shein-fashion-retailer-child-labour-supply-chain\">come under scrutiny</a> for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65990529\">child, forced and unfair labour practices</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/02/details-i-made-they-made-designers-hit-back-at-sheins-imitation-game\">copyright infringement</a> and <a href=\"https://goodonyou.eco/chemicals-in-fast-fashion/\">concerns about product safety</a>.</p> <p>(When these allegations were raised with Shein, a spokesperson says it is committed to ensuring the fair treatment of workers and prohibits child or forced labour within the supply chain, its suppliers are required to certify that their products do not infringe on intellectual property, and it works with third parties to test products according to its safety standards. Temu says it prohibits forced labour, invests in intellectual property protection measures and uses \u201calgorithmic\u201d monitoring and manual review to detect and remove products that do not comply with product safety standards.)</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>In addition to their rapid growth and supply chain concerns, the brands are known for <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-08/rise-of-shein-temu-effect-on-australian-retail-ecommerce-future/103546188\">aggressive marketing tactics</a>. For both purchases, I use a burner email account, make sure not to share my phone number, pay using PayPal and opt out of promotional marketing.</p> <p>In the days and weeks that follow, the only communications from Temu are notifications about my delivery. Shein sends me at least one email a day announcing sales and new styles.</p> <p>Under <a href=\"https://www.acma.gov.au/avoid-sending-spam\">Australia\u2019s spam legislation</a>, a company must have a customer\u2019s consent to send marketing messages or emails. The consent can be express \u2013 like ticking a box \u2013 or inferred \u2013 which usually involves proving an ongoing relationship. Associate Prof Katherine Kemp, an expert in data privacy and consumer protection at the University of New South Wales, says it is possible to make a complaint to the Australian Communications and Media Authority about a company ignoring your unsubscribes. (When I did unsubscribe from Shein\u2019s emails, they stopped). Surprisingly, I\u2019m not inundated with Shein and Temu advertisements on social media or other websites.</p> <h2>\u2018That\u2019s really cheaply done\u2019</h2>    <p>Eight days later, a white plastic bag from Shein arrives, and the Temu delivery comes two days after that. I unpack them with Gareth Kershaw, a lecturer in fashion technology at RMIT University. We start with the Shein bomber jacket.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not been nicely finished,\u201d he says. \u201cYou see how everything\u2019s sort of a bit skew-whiff. You\u2019ve got creases here and gathering here. This material is not very stable.\u201d</p> <p>He points out the \u201cquite dodgy\u201d mismatched seams, and the raw edges inside the pockets \u2013 \u201cthat\u2019s really cheaply done\u201d. Some of the buttons are too close together and the rib along the bottom of the jacket is too narrow \u2013 \u201cif it\u2019s a design feature, it\u2019s not very nice\u201d. He estimates the cost price to be between $3 and $4.50.</p>    <p>He\u2019s more impressed by the T-shirt (although we started at a low bar). \u201cIt\u2019s got a nice handle,\u201d he says, referring to the way the fabric feels and drapes. He points out the \u201cnice detail\u201d of the internal seam along the back of the neckand says because of the high polyester content the T-shirt is likely to wash well, \u201cuntil you spill your coffee on it\u201d. (Polyester is plastic made from oil, so it holds on to stains). He\u2019s more critical of some of the other seams, pointing out raw edges and wonky lines. \u201cIt takes time and skill to be proficient at sewing,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/19/wicked-review-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-wizard-of-oz-stephen-schwartz\">Wicked review \u2013 Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande are a blast in sugar-rush Wizard of Oz fantasy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He estimates the cost price of the T-shirt to be about $1, of which the garment worker might be getting paid 60 cents. The payment structure in many factories \u2013 known as piecework \u2013 sees workers paid based on how many garments they finish, not how many hours they work. \u201cSo, if you need to make money, you\u2019ve got to make a lot of T-shirts, hundreds and hundreds to make it worthwhile,\u201d he says.</p> <p>(According to a Shein spokesperson, the company is committed to providing customers with \u201cvalue-for-money, quality products\u201d, and holds its vendors to strict product quality inspection standards.)</p> <p>We move on to the Temu skirt, which mystifies Kershaw. It has so many details: buttons, eyelets, drawstrings, cargo pockets, hip pockets and snap locks. He calculates it took at least eight different machines and processes to make it. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they make any money on this,\u201d he says.</p>    <p>He points out some poorly executed details. For instance, the buttons and snap locks are different colours: \u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer to match your trims.\u201d. He also points out some shortcuts in the construction: shirt buttonholes instead of the keyhole style typically used for streetwear detailing; no fusing to stabilise the garment structure; rippling and pinching seams; and the loose threads covering the skirt.</p> <p>On the other hand, the fabric is nicer than the bomber jacket, the detailing in the waistband \u201clooks good\u201d and many of the processes used to make it require expensive machines. The lack of consistency suggests to him that the factory may not have anyone on staff with an understanding of product development that goes beyond just \u201cputting stuff together\u201d.</p> <p>He examines the shoes. They\u2019re made of several different kinds of plastic, using a mix of glue and welding. Kershaw highlights the detail that has gone into the strap across the foot. Elastic between the buckle and the shoe seems to have been added for comfort. \u201cIf it were super cheap, it would just all be the same material,\u201d he says. His biggest concern is the mesh outer, which might catch on things as the wearer sits or walks around.\u201cIt will probably wear out quite quickly.\u201d</p> <p>One morning I put on the shoes and walk to a nearby cafe. They are really light and since they are plastic mesh I can feel the air on my feet. It\u2019s almost as if I\u2019m not wearing shoes, except the plastic is making the soles of my feet clammy \u2013 a sensation that threatens to get worse with time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/20/australian-supermarket-kombucha-taste-test-how-can-a-beverage-be-so-wet-and-so-dry-at-the-same-time\">Australian supermarket kombucha taste test: \u2018How can a beverage be so wet and so dry at the same time?\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Online reviews of the jacket are mixed but the T-shirt, skirt and shoes have hundreds of positive comments from customers satisfied by the quality relative to the price \u2013 a reflection of how far consumer expectations have fallen when it comes to clothing and footwear.</p> <p>Temu and Shein deliver cheaper products that, to an untrained eye, are not that different to garments costing four or five times the price.

      "bodyText": "Every time a friend tells me they\u2019re deleting Instagram, a small part of me dies. From fighting for my life in the RuneScape Wilderness to crying over cruel ask.fm questions to my ill-fated-beauty-YouTuber stint in 2010 \u2026 I grew up on the internet. I hate it, I love it, but it\u2019s an intrinsic part of who I am now. While my list has me questioning myself deeply, it does make me laugh, and good laughter has been my saving grace of late. Hopefully it might make some of you laugh too. Here goes. 1. This octopus that can walk Starting strong with something that I honestly don\u2019t know if I find raucously funny or absolutely terrifying. Something about this pseudo-amphibian octopus decidedly does not sit right with me, but does it make me chuckle? Yes. Convulse? A little. This video is something I\u2019ll never be able to un-see, and now you too are afflicted. You\u2019re welcome. 2. I Think You Should Leave \u2013 Zipline I did a show called Apples Never Fall last year with some incredibly funny people, and among some of my fondest memories of the shoot is sitting in our green room watching Tim Robinson sketches on my castmate\u2019s phone while we absolutely pissed ourselves. This one had multiple re-runs. 3. Richard E Grant\u2019s Instagram Oh isn\u2019t it just fantastic! Thank you Richard. Golden. 4. What is this, ice? I believe my older brother Will showed this to me for the first time many, many years ago. This is the kind of video that I will rewatch forever, and stridently bring out at parties to even the most tepid of audiences. 5. Shannon Sheridan as Kim Cattrall scatting This is two for one. Kim Cattrall scatting will always be a classic gag. It truly never misses. I have recited this particular string of sounds many a time for my (evidently) wonderfully tolerant friends. THEN my hilarious friend Shannon flawlessly recreated what was already one of the funniest things I have seen on the internet. Thank you Shannon. 6. Mamma Mia Comic Relief No notes. To me, you are perfect. Personal highlights include \u201cchicken tikka, tell me the truth\u201d and the inspired casting of the Swede. Would recommend watching both parts. 7. The man who makes all the ice cubes in Europe Two words. Is eneuf. 8. Alison Brie and I on the Slingshot I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d put myself in this list under any circumstances, but this is a video of Ali and I on the infamous Slingshot ride in the Gold Coast that makes me proper belly-laugh. I ask you to kindly ignore the sounds that emerge from me and instead watch Ali as her soul leaves her body for a full 10 seconds. 9. Berlin Germany Need I say more? Just excellent. 10. Servideo\u2019s Breakfast Club Lauren Servideo, one of the great comedic minds of our time, made a video that had me guffawing through 2018. I even recreated it once with some particularly long sweater sleeves and had the gall to DM it to Lauren with a message reading, \u201cLove you SM, I hope this makes sense.\u201d To my utter delight, she replied: \u201cIt makes perfect sense and I SIMPLY LOVE.\u201d Clearly, I never got over it.",

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s longest-serving MPs, Labour\u2019s Diane Abbott and the Conservative Sir Edward Leigh, have issued a joint call urging the Commons to reject the assisted dying bill, arguing it is being rushed through and puts vulnerable people at risk.</p> <p>Writing for the Guardian, Abbott and Leigh \u2013 the mother and father of the house \u2013 said there had been insufficient scrutiny of the law and urged parliament to instead focus on better health and care services.</p> <p>Four influential new Labour MPs have said they have also decided to oppose the bill amid concerns about the process and the pressure it has put on new parliamentarians.</p> <p>A landmark vote on legalising assisted dying is due to be held on Friday 29 November. It is a free vote, meaning MPs can decide whether to support or oppose it. In 2015, an assisted dying bill was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/11/mps-begin-debate-assisted-dying-bill\">rejected by 330 votes to 118</a>, but since then a number of other countries have legalised the practice and polls show widespread public support.</p> <p>About 100 Labour MPs are still believed to be undecided. However, the bill\u2019s backers remain confident they can be won over once they consider all the evidence.</p> <p>Keir Starmer and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/18/how-are-are-cabinet-ministers-likely-to-vote-on-assisted-dying\">majority of the cabinet are expected to support the bill</a>, though there have been high-profile interventions opposing it, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/13/assisted-dying-law-nhs-cuts-wes-streeting\">from the health secretary, Wes Streeting</a>.</p> <p>Questions have been raised about the drafting of the legislation \u2013 which is a private member\u2019s bill from the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater rather than having been drawn up by the government \u2013 and whether it is sufficiently watertight.</p> <p>The Guardian has learned it was drafted by Dame Elizabeth Gardiner, who retired this year after almost a decade as first parliamentary counsel, the government\u2019s most senior and experienced legislative drafter.</p> <p>In the latest intervention, Abbott and Leigh said they were concerned that a gap of 18 days between the publication of Leadbeater\u2019s bill and the first vote was too short, and that was exacerbated by the unusually high number of new MPs unfamiliar with Commons procedures.</p> <p>Leigh is a longtime Eurosceptic on the right of the Tory party and Abbott, a pivotal figure on Labour\u2019s left, was the first Black woman in the Commons and served in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet.</p> <p>They write: \u201cThere is more than a suspicion that the pressure groups behind this proposed change have sought to take advantage of an inexperienced new parliament. Either way, the flawed process has been lamentable and wholly unacceptable for a matter of such importance.\u201d</p> <p>The pair also voice concern that efforts to introduce the law have been highlighted by celebrities who are terminally ill and this could mask the potential inadvertent impact on less well-protected people.</p> <p>\u201cWe do not doubt their sincerity and sympathise greatly with anyone experiencing the fear and pain that can sadly accompany terminal illness. But MPs must make laws based on their effect on every member of society, not just those whose profile gives them a prominent voice,\u201d they say.</p> <p>\u201cImagine the pensioner whose children cannot afford houses of their own watching her limited savings, earmarked for those children, disappearing on social care and so feeling a \u2018duty to die\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The four new Labour MPs who have spoken to the Guardian said they were convinced by Streeting\u2019s argument that NHS care was not good enough to allow assisted dying to be legalised.</p> <p>Antonia Bance, a former senior aide at the Trades Union Congress who became an MP in July, said: \u201cWe were elected to fix the NHS \u2013 but it will take time. Yet somehow we are in a position where we may legalise assisted dying, knowing that many people may opt for it because they can\u2019t get the care they are entitled to from our broken NHS.\u201d</p> <p>James Frith, the Bury North MP who returned this year, said he had deep concerns about the quality of palliative care, and said that good care was \u201cundervalued\u201d. He said a member of his family was facing terminal cancer and the legislation did not address his concerns around coercion and doubt.</p> <p>\u201cI think this risks feeling rushed and not the right time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also a door I don\u2019t want opened by a new parliament learning its skill, given too little time and with much that can be added once the principal shift happens. For me, this is protecting our most vulnerable groups as well as all of us at our most vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>Melanie Ward, the former chief executive of Medical Aid for Palestinians who is now the MP for Cowdenbeath and Kirkcaldy, said she had spent time listening to arguments on both sides before deciding to vote against.</p> <p>\u201cThe strongest argument in favour of the bill is about personal choice and freedom, that has come across really clearly. But my concern is in seeking to do that, we are going to put at risk a much larger group of vulnerable people,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Polly Billington, the MP for East Thanet and former special adviser to Ed Miliband, said her concerns were \u201cthe risks around internalised pressure and the problems of capacity combined with some of the considerations for our healthcare professionals and medical teams\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNone of that has been articulated and it needs to be,\u201d she said. \u201cFar too many people are saying: \u2018Oh, don\u2019t worry about that, let\u2019s agree the principle and we can sort out the practicalities later,\u2019 and that\u2019s just not good enough,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Leadbeater has said the bill has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/11/assisted-dying-bills-strict-safeguards-to-include-long-jail-terms-for-coercion\">stringent safeguards</a>, including requiring approval from two doctors and a high court judge, and lengthy prison sentences for coercion. Patients must have the mental capacity to make a choice about the end of their life and must be terminally ill and expected to die within six months.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s longest-serving MPs, Labour\u2019s Diane Abbott and the Conservative Sir Edward Leigh, have issued a joint call urging the Commons to reject the assisted dying bill, arguing it is being rushed through and puts vulnerable people at risk. Writing for the Guardian, Abbott and Leigh \u2013 the mother and father of the house \u2013 said there had been insufficient scrutiny of the law and urged parliament to instead focus on better health and care services. Four influential new Labour MPs have said they have also decided to oppose the bill amid concerns about the process and the pressure it has put on new parliamentarians. A landmark vote on legalising assisted dying is due to be held on Friday 29 November. It is a free vote, meaning MPs can decide whether to support or oppose it. In 2015, an assisted dying bill was rejected by 330 votes to 118, but since then a number of other countries have legalised the practice and polls show widespread public support. About 100 Labour MPs are still believed to be undecided. However, the bill\u2019s backers remain confident they can be won over once they consider all the evidence. Keir Starmer and a majority of the cabinet are expected to support the bill, though there have been high-profile interventions opposing it, including from the health secretary, Wes Streeting. Questions have been raised about the drafting of the legislation \u2013 which is a private member\u2019s bill from the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater rather than having been drawn up by the government \u2013 and whether it is sufficiently watertight. The Guardian has learned it was drafted by Dame Elizabeth Gardiner, who retired this year after almost a decade as first parliamentary counsel, the government\u2019s most senior and experienced legislative drafter. In the latest intervention, Abbott and Leigh said they were concerned that a gap of 18 days between the publication of Leadbeater\u2019s bill and the first vote was too short, and that was exacerbated by the unusually high number of new MPs unfamiliar with Commons procedures. Leigh is a longtime Eurosceptic on the right of the Tory party and Abbott, a pivotal figure on Labour\u2019s left, was the first Black woman in the Commons and served in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet. They write: \u201cThere is more than a suspicion that the pressure groups behind this proposed change have sought to take advantage of an inexperienced new parliament. Either way, the flawed process has been lamentable and wholly unacceptable for a matter of such importance.\u201d The pair also voice concern that efforts to introduce the law have been highlighted by celebrities who are terminally ill and this could mask the potential inadvertent impact on less well-protected people. \u201cWe do not doubt their sincerity and sympathise greatly with anyone experiencing the fear and pain that can sadly accompany terminal illness. But MPs must make laws based on their effect on every member of society, not just those whose profile gives them a prominent voice,\u201d they say. \u201cImagine the pensioner whose children cannot afford houses of their own watching her limited savings, earmarked for those children, disappearing on social care and so feeling a \u2018duty to die\u2019.\u201d The four new Labour MPs who have spoken to the Guardian said they were convinced by Streeting\u2019s argument that NHS care was not good enough to allow assisted dying to be legalised. Antonia Bance, a former senior aide at the Trades Union Congress who became an MP in July, said: \u201cWe were elected to fix the NHS \u2013 but it will take time. Yet somehow we are in a position where we may legalise assisted dying, knowing that many people may opt for it because they can\u2019t get the care they are entitled to from our broken NHS.\u201d James Frith, the Bury North MP who returned this year, said he had deep concerns about the quality of palliative care, and said that good care was \u201cundervalued\u201d. He said a member of his family was facing terminal cancer and the legislation did not address his concerns around coercion and doubt. \u201cI think this risks feeling rushed and not the right time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also a door I don\u2019t want opened by a new parliament learning its skill, given too little time and with much that can be added once the principal shift happens. For me, this is protecting our most vulnerable groups as well as all of us at our most vulnerable.\u201d Melanie Ward, the former chief executive of Medical Aid for Palestinians who is now the MP for Cowdenbeath and Kirkcaldy, said she had spent time listening to arguments on both sides before deciding to vote against. \u201cThe strongest argument in favour of the bill is about personal choice and freedom, that has come across really clearly. But my concern is in seeking to do that, we are going to put at risk a much larger group of vulnerable people,\u201d she said. Polly Billington, the MP for East Thanet and former special adviser to Ed Miliband, said her concerns were \u201cthe risks around internalised pressure and the problems of capacity combined with some of the considerations for our healthcare professionals and medical teams\u201d. \u201cNone of that has been articulated and it needs to be,\u201d she said. \u201cFar too many people are saying: \u2018Oh, don\u2019t worry about that, let\u2019s agree the principle and we can sort out the practicalities later,\u2019 and that\u2019s just not good enough,\u201d she said. Leadbeater has said the bill has stringent safeguards, including requiring approval from two doctors and a high court judge, and lengthy prison sentences for coercion. Patients must have the mental capacity to make a choice about the end of their life and must be terminally ill and expected to die within six months.",

      "body": "<p>Free votes on conscience matters are comparatively rare in the UK parliament. But they are almost always about issues of once-in-a-generation social change. Laws such as this need the utmost care because of the risk of unintended consequences. This is especially the case with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/03/mps-vote-first-time-assisted-dying-bill-uk-parliament\">current assisted dying bill</a>.</p>      <p>Writing from opposite benches as the father and mother of the house, our concerns are twofold, relating both to the process regarding the bill and its likely practice once implemented. Regarding the process, we have seen our fair share of bills over the years: some good, some bad. Whatever the merits of a bill, laws are always better if there is proper scrutiny and plenty of expert advice has been sought. This is particularly the case with private members\u2019 bills, which often do not enjoy the independent scrutiny that government lawyers can offer.</p> <p>When MPs last voted on this issue less than a decade ago, in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/09/assisted-dying-mps-debate-legislation-lord-falconer-bill-terminally-ill-right-to-die\">Rob Marris published</a> his private member\u2019s bill a full seven weeks before MPs voted on the proposal at second reading, providing time for scrutiny and debate. In contrast, Kim Leadbeater\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/11/the-assisted-dying-bill-what-it-means-for-patients-in-england-and-wales\">bill was published</a> just 18 days ahead of second reading.</p> <p>The inadequacy of this timescale is heightened by the unprecedented number of new MPs. Parliament will have sat for just 12 weeks by the time MPs vote on what is, quite literally, a matter of life and death; many MPs are still relatively unfamiliar with normal parliamentary procedure, let alone for private members\u2019 bills, of which this will be the first in this parliament. There is more than a suspicion that the pressure groups behind this proposed change have sought to take advantage of an inexperienced new parliament. Either way, the flawed process has been lamentable and wholly unacceptable for a matter of such importance.</p> <p>It is not only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/06/assisted-dying-bill-to-be-published-amid-mps-concern-over-scrutiny-legislation\">parliamentary scrutiny</a> that is being limited. There are significant legal and practical issues relating to assisted suicide. Last week, the former president of the high court family division, Sir James Munby, published detailed analysis of the bill\u2019s judicial safeguards and concluded they fall \u201c<a href=\"https://transparencyproject.org.uk/assisted-dying-what-role-for-the-judge-some-further-thoughts/\">lamentably short</a>\u201d. He said: \u201cOnly those who believe implicitly in judicial omniscience and infallibility \u2026 can possibly have any confidence in the efficacy of what is proposed.\u201d Equally importantly, more than <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/11/10/assisted-dying-cannot-be-brought-in-safely-while-nhs-broken/\">3,000 medical professionals</a> have expressed concerns about the effect on their profession, were assisted dying to be made legal.</p> <p>But our worry about this bill is not just about the rushed process.

      "bodyText": "Free votes on conscience matters are comparatively rare in the UK parliament. But they are almost always about issues of once-in-a-generation social change. Laws such as this need the utmost care because of the risk of unintended consequences. This is especially the case with the current assisted dying bill. Writing from opposite benches as the father and mother of the house, our concerns are twofold, relating both to the process regarding the bill and its likely practice once implemented. Regarding the process, we have seen our fair share of bills over the years: some good, some bad. Whatever the merits of a bill, laws are always better if there is proper scrutiny and plenty of expert advice has been sought. This is particularly the case with private members\u2019 bills, which often do not enjoy the independent scrutiny that government lawyers can offer. When MPs last voted on this issue less than a decade ago, in 2015, Rob Marris published his private member\u2019s bill a full seven weeks before MPs voted on the proposal at second reading, providing time for scrutiny and debate. In contrast, Kim Leadbeater\u2019s bill was published just 18 days ahead of second reading. The inadequacy of this timescale is heightened by the unprecedented number of new MPs. Parliament will have sat for just 12 weeks by the time MPs vote on what is, quite literally, a matter of life and death; many MPs are still relatively unfamiliar with normal parliamentary procedure, let alone for private members\u2019 bills, of which this will be the first in this parliament. There is more than a suspicion that the pressure groups behind this proposed change have sought to take advantage of an inexperienced new parliament. Either way, the flawed process has been lamentable and wholly unacceptable for a matter of such importance. It is not only parliamentary scrutiny that is being limited. There are significant legal and practical issues relating to assisted suicide. Last week, the former president of the high court family division, Sir James Munby, published detailed analysis of the bill\u2019s judicial safeguards and concluded they fall \u201clamentably short\u201d. He said: \u201cOnly those who believe implicitly in judicial omniscience and infallibility \u2026 can possibly have any confidence in the efficacy of what is proposed.\u201d Equally importantly, more than 3,000 medical professionals have expressed concerns about the effect on their profession, were assisted dying to be made legal. But our worry about this bill is not just about the rushed process. We are also concerned about how the new legislation would be implemented in practice, particularly as regards to vulnerable groups. The organisations campaigning for a change in the law have successfully used high-profile celebrities to promote the cause. We do not doubt their sincerity, and sympathise greatly with anyone experiencing the fear and pain that can sadly accompany terminal illness, but MPs must make laws based on their effect on every member of society, not just those whose profile gives them a prominent voice. Evidence from elsewhere suggests those most at risk when assisted suicide is legalised are vulnerable minorities. Such people, unlike privileged elites who are used to exercising autonomy over every part of their lives and who can afford good-quality social and palliative care, are most likely to resign themselves to an assisted death against their will because they are unable to access the support they require. Imagine the pensioner whose children cannot afford houses of their own watching her limited savings, earmarked for those children, disappearing on social care and so feeling a \u201cduty to die\u201d. And, sadly, it is not impossible to imagine a malevolent family member tacitly pressuring a disabled terminally ill relative to consider an assisted death, either because of the time-consuming and emotional burden their care has become, or even to be able to access the assets they will inherit more quickly. Or consider the elderly widow who has been hospitalised and worries she is taking up a valuable bed in an NHS under significant strain and would be better off dead. Incidents such as these would be relatively rare, but the very act of legalising assisted suicide makes them possible. It is because, as demonstrated elsewhere, it is simply not possible to avoid such scenarios if assisted suicide were to be made legal that the only adequate safeguard is to keep the current law unchanged. Meanwhile, we should be investing instead in improving our health and social care system generally.

There are also close ties between NBC News and CNBC, the financial news network. MSNBC has faced intense scrutiny following the election victory of Donald Trump earlier this month. Ratings have dropped significantly in the aftermath of the result, while viewership of the rightwing Fox News held firm. The spun-off business will also include the ticketing website Fandango and reviews website Rotten Tomatoes. Comcast said the company it is spinning off, which it dubbed \u201cSpinCo\u201d, generated $7bn in sales in the year to 30 September, although its announcement did not set out how this compared with previous years. \u201cThis transaction positions both SpinCo and NBCUniversal to play offense in a changing media landscape,\u201d claimed Mike Cavanagh, president of Comcast, who added that it would put Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal division \u201con a new growth trajectory\u201d.",

Willoughby-Herard is Black.<strong> </strong>Among the 50 protesters charged, only one other protester, a Latina graduate student, faces any additional charges beyond failing to disperse.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Orange county district attorney\u2019s office said in response to the charges and allegations of bias that everyone arrested was treated equally under the law.</p> <p>\u201cFreedom of speech is a right afforded to everyone, but university campuses are not immune from criminal consequences when peaceful protests cross the line into criminal behavior,\u201d they said.</p> <p>McClanahan argued the charges, doxxing and harassment of protesters has had a chilling effect on campus activism.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea that the campus\u2019s response to that is going to be to participate in this political and legal repression, it\u2019s just crazy to me,\u201d she added.</p> <p>A spokesperson for UC Irvine said that the school<strong> </strong>\u201chas a longstanding commitment to upholding free speech and peaceful protest. While we encourage all members of the campus community to exercise their right to express their views, they are also expected to comply with all applicable laws, university policies, and codes of conduct while doing so.\u201d</p> <p>They added: \u201cIt is important to clarify that the university is not involved in the decision by the Orange County District Attorney\u2019s office to file criminal charges against individuals arrested on campus during the May 15 incident.\u201d</p> <p>Willoughby-Herard criticized the criminalization of protesters for calling out the use of funds and resources from universities toward \u201cmilitarism and genocide\u201d, and for <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vRQB94JvZSgS42zkIIdsbbeV8skGLgseX8qzZNC-Z1yQupMklVeqVU9dQ5UQ5Nj4p6-cB1MMeGeoO8q/pub\">pushing</a> for divestment and a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot war-machine your way out of massive social problems that actually require study and reflection,\u201d she said.</p>",

The analysis shows that of 935 arrests, 440 cases are still pending, 120 people have been formally charged, charges for 181 have been dismissed, 33 cases were sent to pretrial diversion programs and one protester was sentenced. After the charges were announced by the Orange county district attorney\u2019s office in September 2024, a truck billboard drove around the UC Irvine campus with the names, faces and charges of 10 individuals charged, including Willoughby-Herard, launched by the far-right activist group Accuracy in Media. There has been significant organizing in the US and abroad in protest of the charges against Willoughby-Herard, one of few US professors with pending charges related to pro-Palestinian protests. The American Political Science Association condemned her arrest. An open letter signed by more than 8,000 faculty, scholars and students around the US and abroad has been circulating, calling for the charges against her to be dropped. Another petition protesting the charges has been circulated by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair). Annie McClanahan, associate professor of English at UC Irvine and chair of the Irvine Faculty Association, criticized the charges and the response to the protests by UC Irvine. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear, looking at the way that charge-stacking is being used against Dr Willoughby-Herard in particular, that there\u2019s a racial component of that as well, and the fact the campus administration has essentially done nothing to request the DA office to not pursue these charges, is really concerning,\u201d she said. Willoughby-Herard is Black. Among the 50 protesters charged, only one other protester, a Latina graduate student, faces any additional charges beyond failing to disperse. A spokesperson for the Orange county district attorney\u2019s office said in response to the charges and allegations of bias that everyone arrested was treated equally under the law. \u201cFreedom of speech is a right afforded to everyone, but university campuses are not immune from criminal consequences when peaceful protests cross the line into criminal behavior,\u201d they said. McClanahan argued the charges, doxxing and harassment of protesters has had a chilling effect on campus activism. \u201cThe idea that the campus\u2019s response to that is going to be to participate in this political and legal repression, it\u2019s just crazy to me,\u201d she added. A spokesperson for UC Irvine said that the school \u201chas a longstanding commitment to upholding free speech and peaceful protest. While we encourage all members of the campus community to exercise their right to express their views, they are also expected to comply with all applicable laws, university policies, and codes of conduct while doing so.\u201d They added: \u201cIt is important to clarify that the university is not involved in the decision by the Orange County District Attorney\u2019s office to file criminal charges against individuals arrested on campus during the May 15 incident.\u201d Willoughby-Herard criticized the criminalization of protesters for calling out the use of funds and resources from universities toward \u201cmilitarism and genocide\u201d, and for pushing for divestment and a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. \u201cYou cannot war-machine your way out of massive social problems that actually require study and reflection,\u201d she said.",

      "body": "<p>The mayor of Tower Hamlets is facing a judicial review this week over his decision to remove three low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) in the east London area of Bethnal Green.</p> <p>The campaign group Save Our Safer Streets (SOSS) says the LTNs are vital to protect children in deprived areas from pollution and the risks of heavy traffic.</p> <p>The group has raised nearly <a href=\"https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/save-our-safer-streets-in-tower-hamlets/\">\u00a380,000 through a crowdfunder</a> to pay lawyers to bring the legal proceedings. In a two-day hearing starting on Wednesday, a judge will consider whether the mayor, Lutfur Rahman, broke the law when he announced last September that he would be removing the LTNs in the east London area of Bethnal Green.</p> <p>Jane Harris, a spokesperson for SOSS, told the Guardian: \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to get to the point of taking the council to court. We have asked to meet the mayor and talk many times, but he has refused to meet us. This is despite over 3,000 people signing a petition to keep the LTNs.</p> <p>\u201cThe LTNs are working. The air quality is better, more people are cycling and walking. We have really widespread support, from the local hospitals to schools in the area.

      "bodyText": "The mayor of Tower Hamlets is facing a judicial review this week over his decision to remove three low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) in the east London area of Bethnal Green. The campaign group Save Our Safer Streets (SOSS) says the LTNs are vital to protect children in deprived areas from pollution and the risks of heavy traffic. The group has raised nearly \u00a380,000 through a crowdfunder to pay lawyers to bring the legal proceedings. In a two-day hearing starting on Wednesday, a judge will consider whether the mayor, Lutfur Rahman, broke the law when he announced last September that he would be removing the LTNs in the east London area of Bethnal Green. Jane Harris, a spokesperson for SOSS, told the Guardian: \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to get to the point of taking the council to court. We have asked to meet the mayor and talk many times, but he has refused to meet us. This is despite over 3,000 people signing a petition to keep the LTNs. \u201cThe LTNs are working. The air quality is better, more people are cycling and walking. We have really widespread support, from the local hospitals to schools in the area. We are particularly grateful to those who put their own hard-earned money into our campaign.\u201d Lawyers from Leigh Day will argue that the mayor ignored government guidance on LTNs, and that he ran a flawed consultation and decision-making process. They will also argue that he failed to properly consider if removing the LTN\u2019s safer street layouts would be a good use of \u00a32.5m. Transport for London has joined the case as an \u201cinterested party\u201d, taking part in the challenge against Tower Hamlets. A TfL spokesperson said: \u201cWalking and cycling infrastructure, including low-traffic neighbourhoods, can play an important role in making our streets safer and enabling more active travel across London. It is important that councils follow established processes before this infrastructure is changed or removed.\u201d Other supporters of the LTNs include Barts NHS health trust who have written to the mayor outlining the risks to public health of removing them. They said: \u201cTower Hamlets has the lowest car ownership in London, yet those living, working or studying [here] are exposed to the fifth worst air quality of any London borough, regularly exceeding WHO safety limits.\u201d In February last year, five headteachers in one of the affected areas wrote an open letter to Rahman asking him to keep the restrictions in place. Rahman was elected as an independent mayor in May 2022 following a five-year ban on standing for public office after an election court found him guilty of corrupt and illegal practices. A Tower Hamlets council spokesperson said: \u201cWe remain confident in our legal position and we look forward to the outcome of this week\u2019s hearing.\u201d Rahman has previously argued that because his plans to remove the LTNs were part of his manifesto, they have a democratic mandate, saying: \u201cThese closures have impacted thousands of working people in Tower Hamlets. They have pushed huge amounts of traffic on to [other] roads \u2026 and are simply moving congestion and pollution on to the most vulnerable residents.\u201d Residents have previously told the Guardian the closures have made their lives harder.

In the US election this month, some media reported that he <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/07/trump-black-latino-men-working-class-00188185\">doubled his share</a> of the Black male vote and <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-black-voters-gains-results-1982939\">won more Black voters than any other Republican</a> in almost 50 years. This was history! Well, not quite, Lauren N Williams tells me. \u201cThe numbers overall are almost identical to how people voted in 2020,\u201d she says. According to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/exit-polls-2024-election/\">exit</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2024/exit-polls/national-results/general/president/0\">polls</a>, Black voters turned out for Harris at 85%, and for Joe Biden at 87%. The only real difference is that the number of Black men who voted for Kamala Harris dropped slightly, while <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/national-results\">Black male Trump support increased slightly</a> from 19% in 2020 to 21% in 2024. But, she says, more than 7 million fewer people voted for Harris than Biden. While Trump picked up more Black male voters than he did back then \u2013 a detail heavily emphasised in media coverage <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/democrats-republicans-black-vote/680480/\">before</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/columnists/2024/11/06/harris-trump-black-men-voters/76097675007/\">after</a> the election \u2013 the prevailing narrative does not account for the fact that: \u201cIt\u2019s not only this switch to Trump,\u201d Lauren says. People stayed home, or people voted third party. If you don\u2019t look at the whole picture, then yes, you arrive at the narrative that Black people are swinging one way.\u201d</p> <p>Why was this contextualisation missing from post-election analysis? Because it doesn\u2019t make for a sexy story. \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to people when you have a character like Trump and he attracts folks who you wouldn\u2019t normally think would be into his policies and persona,\u201d Lauren says. \u201cIt\u2019s typical that white male voters vote for him overwhelmingly \u2013 but what\u2019s not typical is when people of colour do so. For a lot of news media, that is a really attractive story.\u201d</p> <p>I asked her about the viral clip of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/10/obama-kamala-harris-pennsylvania-trump\">Barack Obama scolding Black male voters</a> for seemingly not turning out as strongly for Harris as they did for him when he ran. Even I flinched when I saw it, and thought, wow, the Democrats must really be in trouble. But, according to Lauren, the emergency button on that narrative had so constantly been pressed by poll analysts (a narrative that, if I may, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/19/harris-black-male-vote-polls\">the Guardian avoided</a>), that even the Democrats panicked and fell for it, sending Obama to \u201cfinger-wag\u201d at prospective voters.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>\u2018Complicating the narrative\u2019</strong></p>    <p>It\u2019s still interesting to me that a candidate like Trump, with his record on racism, could win over more Black men, even in context. But Lauren calls my attention to a far bigger and more interesting story that has been reduced to a footnote of the election: Harris won almost the entire Black female vote. \u201cIf you had white women voting 90%-plus for a candidate, you would not hear the end of that story. It would be endlessly curious and interesting and fascinating. We lose a lot by not applying that same level of curiosity to the ways that other demographics vote.\u201d I can see that this also applies to Black men, three-quarters of whom still voted Democrat. \u201cThis story could have been \u2018look at the power that Black voters wield\u2019, but that\u2019s just not the American narrative.\u201d</p> <p>And what we lose is a big deal. By writing off those who voted for Harris as doing so simply out of blind loyalty, the reasons for Trump\u2019s victory risk becoming detached from reality. Another broad headline after the election was that there was actually nothing sinister going on \u2013 it was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/americans-fed-up-with-economy-turn-to-trump-60-minutes-transcript/\">just\u201d the economy</a>. But the Black people who voted for Harris are disproportionately working class, Lauren says, and have made informed decisions despite their economic status because they are accustomed to making compromises and always thinking about \u201cthe greater good\u201d. \u201cIn the discussions that a lot of the media has about the working class, the undertone is that they are only talking about the white working class\u201d, because considering Black voters as part of the American working class \u201ccomplicates the narrative\u201d. People would have to reckon with the fact that \u201cBlack Americans who experience disfranchisement and a huge racial wealth gap were not wooed by this idea of economic anxiety\u201d.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Anti-racism has fallen out of fashion</strong></p>    <p>\u201cComplicating the narrative\u201d raises the question: why is it that white people are seemingly more anxious about the economy than Black people who are less well off? There is little interest in the answer to this question, says Lauren. \u201cI think people have decided that race is boring,\u201d she says, even though it\u2019s \u201cat the root of so much. Any time we talk about identity politics, we\u2019re talking about people of colour, even though Trump ran on white male identity.\u201d By only treating white people as rational economic voters, we pay \u201can undue amount of attention\u201d to factors outside race, even though it\u2019s \u201cright up there\u201d. I have definitely noticed a shift since Trump\u2019s first election victory eight years ago. The <a href=\"https://time.com/4573307/donald-trump-white-rage/\">myriad \u201cwhite rage\u201d takes of 2016</a> are thin on the ground this time, despite Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign being even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/31/six-racist-bigoted-comments-trump-madison-square-garden\">more explicitly racist</a>.</p> <p>A growing backlash to Black Lives Matter also played a role. \u201cWe shifted so far after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/the-guardian-view-on-the-death-of-george-floyd-a-turning-point\">George Floyd</a>,\u201d Lauren says, \u201cwhether we saw corporations \u2013 symbolic or not \u2013 changing their behaviour and relationships to racism and people were pissed about that. Not everyone was on the Black Lives Matter bandwagon.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>What next for Black Americans?</strong></p>    <p>If this is how the election analysis has played out, it does not bode well for the next four years. Perhaps we\u2019ll see wall-to-wall coverage of Trump\u2019s \u201cappeal\u201d to the white working class and continued disregard for the millions of Black people who didn\u2019t vote for him, who now have to live under a regime that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-department-of-education-dei-b2646489.html\">aims to dismantle federal anti-discrimination policies\u201d</a>.

This week, I had a chat with Lauren N Williams, the deputy editor for race and equity at the Guardian US, about the country\u2019s election results and the role Black voters played. I wanted to discuss the reported swing among Black voters to Donald Trump, which seemed pretty significant. However, talking to her made me see things from a different angle. But first, the weekly roundup. Weekly roundup Barbados PM invites Trump for climate talks | At the UN\u2019s Cop29 climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, Mia Mottley told the Guardian that she would \u201cfind common purpose in saving the planet\u201d with the president-elect of the US. Trump\u2019s re-election has aggravated fears about the future of climate action. Malcolm X family sues over assassination | The family of Malcolm X have filed a $100m federal lawsuit against the CIA, FBI and New York police department over his death. The lawsuit alleges that law enforcement agencies knew of the plot to assassinate the civil rights leader in 1965 but did not act to stop it. Kenyans embrace standup comedy | Comedy is booming in Kenya, with new venues and a fresh wave of standups picking up the mic. As our east Africa correspondent, Carlos Mureithi, reports: \u201cTopics encompass daily life and the entire range of challenges that beset the country \u2026 as performers tap into the power of standup to make people laugh about their difficulties.\u201d Steve McQueen reveals cancer treatment | The Oscar-winning film director and artist Steve McQueen underwent treatment for prostate cancer in 2022. The Blitz producer, whose father died of the disease in 2006, has helped raise awareness of the higher risk of prostate cancer among Black men, and directed a short campaign film, Embarassed. Evaristos connect at Rio book festival | The British Booker prize-winner Bernardine Evaristo and Brazil\u2019s most celebrated living Black author, Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Evaristo, met for the first time at Festa Liter\u00e1ria das Periferias in Rio de Janeiro last Wednesday.

      "body": "<p>One night after his now infamous appearance at the Trump rally at Madison Square Garden \u2013 where he joked that Black people carve watermelons instead of pumpkins at Halloween and called Puerto Rico a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d \u2013 Tony Hinchcliffe appeared on stage in Austin, back at his day job, as the host of the podcast Kill Tony.</p> <p>When Hinchcliffe took the stage he was still front-page news, the subject of endless cable news panels and late-night talkshow monologues. Some Democratic pollsters were suggesting it was a rare moment that <a href=\"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/pro-trump-comic-puerto-rico-174702390.html\">\u201cbroke through\u201d with voters</a> and could even help Kamala Harris win in Pennsylvania.</p> <p>Instead Hinchcliffe walked out to cheers. \u201cPuerto Ricans are smart enough to know when they\u2019re being used as political fodder and right now that is happening and I apologise to absolutely nobody. Not to the Puerto Ricans, not to the whites, not to the Blacks, not to the Palestinians, not to the Jews and not to my own mother,\u201d he said to screams of delight.</p> <p>The show continued with the opening comic making jokes about putting a Harris-Walz sign on the front lawn being an invitation to get robbed, imagining \u201csome Sam-Smith-looking fuck is in the kitchen wearing a mask in his own house\u201d and finishing the set by joking: \u201cThat\u2019s why I have a Trump sign on my lawn with two swastikas on it.\u201d</p>    <p>Kill Tony is a live comedy show that takes place in Joe Rogan\u2019s Austin comedy club, where new comics get to perform one minute of standup before talking with a panel. The show is the most downloaded comedy podcast in history and sold out two nights at Madison Square Garden in August (with special guests including Andrew Dice Clay, the Black Keys and Aaron Rodgers).</p> <p>It sits in a constellation of entertainment, news and sports programming that has been written about a lot since Harris lost the election. But the Democratic elites have perhaps still not reckoned with the scale of what\u2019s happened. An analogy might be Fox News, which transformed American politics and has probably helped elect thousands of Republicans up and down ballots over many decades.</p> <p>But Fox News is watched by older people \u2013 the median age is 68. Now, a Fox News for the young has been established. It\u2019s not on one channel on a DirectTV box, but its audience is far bigger, potentially reaching 10 times as many people. It\u2019s an amorphous network of podcasts, YouTubers, Twitch streamers and meme accounts from Kill Tony to Joe Rogan to Dilley Meme Team. They encompass entertainment, comedy, sport, health, relationships \u2013 but a distrust of the Democrats and the mainstream media permeates them all.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They blend liberal and conservative culture, blurring the lines of acceptability and making figures like Trump more palatable </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Like Fox News and conservative AM radio, the audiences of these podcasts are scared about a changing world, but their fears are very different from those of older viewers and listeners. They\u2019re less susceptible to bogeymen stories of violent migrants, socialism or kids watching pornography (they <em>are </em>the kids watching pornography). They\u2019re more worried about money in politics, ongoing wars, the #MeToo movement, and liberals who can\u2019t take a joke. They\u2019re also curious about heterodox thinking, history and the environment.</p> <p>Crucially, they\u2019re not on the fringes. Just look at the Spotify podcast charts. Spotify is the most used streaming app in the US, but it skews younger: about 54% of Spotify users are between the ages of 18 and 34. The top three podcasts in the week of the election \u2013 with audiences bigger than those of every news outlet, every true crime show, every wellness blogger \u2013 were from Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson and Theo Von. The rest of the top 25 is made up mostly of other conservative and \u201canti-establishment\u201d commentators, a combination of veterans of Fox News and young upstarts: the Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk, Candace Owens, Ben Shapiro, Megyn Kelly, the former navy Seal Shawn Ryan, the former NYPD officer Dan Bongino. Some of these hosts are partisan but most don\u2019t say they are Republican or even rightwing in focus; they say they are <em>independent</em> and challenge talking point<em>s from both the left and the right</em>. All have endorsed or shown qualified support for Donald Trump.</p>    <p>Take Theo Von, a mullet-sporting comedian from Louisiana who looks 25 but is actually 44. In his post-election episode, he chatted with Matt McCusker, another podcast host in this sphere. Both men hold loosely liberal values but had sympathies with Trump in this election. Von said he was concerned that the American-Israel Public Affairs Committe (Aipac) and lobbyists had \u201cinfiltrated\u201d the Democrats and that the parties were changing. McCusker complained Democrats had started to say \u201cthat Liz Cheney and George W Bush\u201d were a good thing and said they \u201cloved strong borders\u201d whereas the Republican party used to \u201csend people to jail for crack\u201d but now wanted to get people out of prison. Then they started talking about having an American Ninja Warrior-style contest to decide who would come over the border. \u201cThat\u2019d be awesome, dude!\u201d said Von.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/07/joe-rogan-elon-musk-heterodoxy-trump-win-reaction\">Rogan, Musk and an emboldened manosphere salute Trump\u2019s win: \u2018Let that sink in\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Steve Bannon always said the doctrine behind Breitbart was that \u201cpolitics is downstream of culture\u201d and that to change politics one must first change culture. It\u2019s a doctrine that guided Trump to victory during his first campaign, mostly with older white voters, but has been taken to a new apex by these podcasters. They blend liberal and conservative culture, blurring the lines of acceptability and making figures like Trump more palatable to those who might have previously abhorred him.</p> <p>Von, for example, has recently interviewed Trump, the conservative commentator Tomi Lahren, Robert F Kennedy Jr, JD Vance and the psychologist Jordan Peterson but also the softboy British producer James Blake, the progressive comedian John Mulaney and the nonfiction darling Malcolm Gladwell.</p> <p>These podcasters are nothing like the extremist far-right white nationalist and men\u2019s rights influencers, such as Andrew Tate and Gavin McInnes, who are explicit in their hate speech. Instead, they feature left-leaning and comic guests alongside hard-R Republican ones and then include extreme voices, normalising them by association (McInnes appeared on Rogan and Andrew Tate has appeared on Carlson; Rogan says Tate \u201csays very wise things\u201d among \u201cridiculous shit\u201d). Kill Tony has an incredibly diverse mix of regular comedians, including a huge number of comics with disabilities. It also has lots of white comics who say the N-word. It\u2019s not simple.</p>    <p>That\u2019s not to say these programs are moderate. Much of what is said is abominable \u2013 racist, hate-filled conspiracy theories and a buzzing misogyny permeate many of them. The problem is that very few in the traditional media are following when they cross the line \u2013 instead they tend to label them all as impossibly illiberal or the vestige of conspiracy theorists. Fox News brought with it an entire ecosystem of Fox News critique: in the 2000s, Jon Stewart became a media studies professor for Americans, analysing and skewering the worst excesses of cable news. Authors such as Michael Wolff and Brian Stelter made their names writing books that explained the inner workings of Fox to liberals and the non-profit Media Matters for America employed a full staff to watch, summarise and push back against Fox News talking points. There is no similar ecosystem monitoring what is said in these brocasts, despite their ever-growing popularity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Democrats have not recognised that many young people, mostly men, exist almost entirely without community</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Part of the reason for that is that they are all incredibly long \u2013 often more than three hours. In the past week alone, Joe Rogan has put out over 15 hours of podcasts; Sneako, a Twitch streamer, has been live for 33 hours and Steven Crowder, another Trump-friendly host, has been streaming on Rumble for over 11 hours. There\u2019s been seven hours of content from Shawn Ryan, six hours from Dan Bongino and four from Theo Von. That is much more time that most people with busy lives can afford \u2013 but if you\u2019re working lonely days from home, driving an Amazon delivery van or just sitting around playing video games, the hosts can become friends that play in the background, much as Fox News has been to older Americans.</p> <p>That constant companionship is crucial to many young men in the US, who are experiencing powerful loneliness. Two-thirds of American men aged 18-23 <a href=\"https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/STATE-OF-AMERICAN-MEN-2023.pdf\">agree with the statement</a> \u201cno one really knows me\u201d. Almost 30% of younger men reported not spending time with someone outside their household in the past week and only one in five men say they have three or more friends in their local area they can depend on. These numbers are even more stark among men who did not go to college, who complain of little or no social or civic engagement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/08/young-men-donald-trump-kamala-harris\">\u2018A fatal miscalculation\u2019: masculinity researcher Richard Reeves on why Democrats lost young men</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This long format not only creates deep bonds with the listener, it goes some way to soften the guests. Pete Hegseth, Trump\u2019s pick for defence secretary, is arguably one of the most heinously malicious actors in American media. During the first Trump administration he successfully persuaded Trump to pardon Edward Gallagher, a Navy Seal who had been reported by his own commandos in Iraq for stabbing a teenage captive to death and killing a school-age girl from a sniper\u2019s roost. Hegseth calls him a warrior and a war hero.</p> <p>But in the long rambling format of the Shawn Ryan show, Hegseth seems at least human. He talks about his tours and \u201cthe ideologues who want to bring a meritocracy to heel\u201d with \u201ctrans stuff\u201d. He says that they need to \u201chire the guy that did Top Gun Maverick\u201d to make military recruiting ads and make combat standards \u201cwhatever they were in, say, I don\u2019t know, 1995\u201d.</p> <p>All these podcasts have similar structures: they\u2019re kind of boring, kind of personal, unedited, the research perfunctory, conjecture flows freely, conclusions are delusive, the people who host them are not that smart, and so it\u2019s easy to get cosy in the warm blanket of male grievance with a man who believes war crimes are justified and women shouldn\u2019t serve in the military. Fox News screeches at you until you\u2019re terrified; these shows lull you in until you\u2019re at ease.</p>    <p>A Reddit thread from a few years ago titled \u201cI don\u2019t have friends I have podcasts\u201d laid bare how extreme this relationship can be. The original poster was complaining that it had become hard for him to have a conversation. \u201cI used to work alone and I would listen to the Joe Rogan experience to fill the silence which was ok at that time but it has grown into me choosing to listen to strangers talk rather that have my own conversations. I enjoy podcasts still, I am just frustrated with myself for pushing people away and substituting life interactions for conversations I don\u2019t get to be a part of.\u201d Commenters agreed \u2013 one said that at \u201ca time and place where I felt really isolated, podcasts filled the void perfectly\u201d but now they are \u201cstill isolated \u2013 sometimes when I\u2019m with actual people, I am looking forward to when I\u2019m alone and listening\u201d.</p> <p>Trump ended up winning men under age 30 by 14 percentage points, according to results from AP VoteCast, a large survey of people who cast ballots this year. That is a nearly 30-point swing from 2020, when Joe Biden bested Trump among the same group by 15 percentage points.</p> <p>Before the election Democrats talked about having a strong ground game. They might be better than Republicans at reaching people within communities \u2013 Black communities, LGBTQ+ communities, labor unions \u2013 but they have not recognised that many young people, mostly men, exist almost entirely without community. They might not ever go to a Trump rally, but when they listen to him on a show like Von\u2019s or Rogan\u2019s, they\u2019ve got a friend.</p>",

Von, for example, has recently interviewed Trump, the conservative commentator Tomi Lahren, Robert F Kennedy Jr, JD Vance and the psychologist Jordan Peterson but also the softboy British producer James Blake, the progressive comedian John Mulaney and the nonfiction darling Malcolm Gladwell. These podcasters are nothing like the extremist far-right white nationalist and men\u2019s rights influencers, such as Andrew Tate and Gavin McInnes, who are explicit in their hate speech. Instead, they feature left-leaning and comic guests alongside hard-R Republican ones and then include extreme voices, normalising them by association (McInnes appeared on Rogan and Andrew Tate has appeared on Carlson; Rogan says Tate \u201csays very wise things\u201d among \u201cridiculous shit\u201d). Kill Tony has an incredibly diverse mix of regular comedians, including a huge number of comics with disabilities. It also has lots of white comics who say the N-word. It\u2019s not simple. That\u2019s not to say these programs are moderate. Much of what is said is abominable \u2013 racist, hate-filled conspiracy theories and a buzzing misogyny permeate many of them. The problem is that very few in the traditional media are following when they cross the line \u2013 instead they tend to label them all as impossibly illiberal or the vestige of conspiracy theorists. Fox News brought with it an entire ecosystem of Fox News critique: in the 2000s, Jon Stewart became a media studies professor for Americans, analysing and skewering the worst excesses of cable news. Authors such as Michael Wolff and Brian Stelter made their names writing books that explained the inner workings of Fox to liberals and the non-profit Media Matters for America employed a full staff to watch, summarise and push back against Fox News talking points. There is no similar ecosystem monitoring what is said in these brocasts, despite their ever-growing popularity. Part of the reason for that is that they are all incredibly long \u2013 often more than three hours. In the past week alone, Joe Rogan has put out over 15 hours of podcasts; Sneako, a Twitch streamer, has been live for 33 hours and Steven Crowder, another Trump-friendly host, has been streaming on Rumble for over 11 hours. There\u2019s been seven hours of content from Shawn Ryan, six hours from Dan Bongino and four from Theo Von. That is much more time that most people with busy lives can afford \u2013 but if you\u2019re working lonely days from home, driving an Amazon delivery van or just sitting around playing video games, the hosts can become friends that play in the background, much as Fox News has been to older Americans. That constant companionship is crucial to many young men in the US, who are experiencing powerful loneliness. Two-thirds of American men aged 18-23 agree with the statement \u201cno one really knows me\u201d. Almost 30% of younger men reported not spending time with someone outside their household in the past week and only one in five men say they have three or more friends in their local area they can depend on. These numbers are even more stark among men who did not go to college, who complain of little or no social or civic engagement. This long format not only creates deep bonds with the listener, it goes some way to soften the guests. Pete Hegseth, Trump\u2019s pick for defence secretary, is arguably one of the most heinously malicious actors in American media. During the first Trump administration he successfully persuaded Trump to pardon Edward Gallagher, a Navy Seal who had been reported by his own commandos in Iraq for stabbing a teenage captive to death and killing a school-age girl from a sniper\u2019s roost. Hegseth calls him a warrior and a war hero. But in the long rambling format of the Shawn Ryan show, Hegseth seems at least human. He talks about his tours and \u201cthe ideologues who want to bring a meritocracy to heel\u201d with \u201ctrans stuff\u201d. He says that they need to \u201chire the guy that did Top Gun Maverick\u201d to make military recruiting ads and make combat standards \u201cwhatever they were in, say, I don\u2019t know, 1995\u201d. All these podcasts have similar structures: they\u2019re kind of boring, kind of personal, unedited, the research perfunctory, conjecture flows freely, conclusions are delusive, the people who host them are not that smart, and so it\u2019s easy to get cosy in the warm blanket of male grievance with a man who believes war crimes are justified and women shouldn\u2019t serve in the military. Fox News screeches at you until you\u2019re terrified; these shows lull you in until you\u2019re at ease. A Reddit thread from a few years ago titled \u201cI don\u2019t have friends I have podcasts\u201d laid bare how extreme this relationship can be. The original poster was complaining that it had become hard for him to have a conversation. \u201cI used to work alone and I would listen to the Joe Rogan experience to fill the silence which was ok at that time but it has grown into me choosing to listen to strangers talk rather that have my own conversations. I enjoy podcasts still, I am just frustrated with myself for pushing people away and substituting life interactions for conversations I don\u2019t get to be a part of.\u201d Commenters agreed \u2013 one said that at \u201ca time and place where I felt really isolated, podcasts filled the void perfectly\u201d but now they are \u201cstill isolated \u2013 sometimes when I\u2019m with actual people, I am looking forward to when I\u2019m alone and listening\u201d. Trump ended up winning men under age 30 by 14 percentage points, according to results from AP VoteCast, a large survey of people who cast ballots this year. That is a nearly 30-point swing from 2020, when Joe Biden bested Trump among the same group by 15 percentage points. Before the election Democrats talked about having a strong ground game. They might be better than Republicans at reaching people within communities \u2013 Black communities, LGBTQ+ communities, labor unions \u2013 but they have not recognised that many young people, mostly men, exist almost entirely without community. They might not ever go to a Trump rally, but when they listen to him on a show like Von\u2019s or Rogan\u2019s, they\u2019ve got a friend.",

He began at Malm\u00f6, after a spell at Bayer Leverkusen\u2019s academy, before heading for Portugal and turning out 77 times for Benfica in sun-dappled Lisbon between 1990 and 94. Schwarz signed for Bruce Rioch at Arsenal and played a campaign in mid-1990s London before moving to Tuscany and three seasons with Fiorentina in Serie A. Picturesque Valencia was next, halfway up Spain\u2019s east coast, a short hop across the Med to Ibiza. Then Peter Reid came calling. Sunderland were evidently concerned about Schwarz attempting to escape: due to the Swedish midfielder\u2019s stated desire to embark on a space flight, the club inserted a clause to void the player\u2019s contract if he exited the earth\u2019s atmosphere. Schwarz enjoyed success with Sunderland in the Premier League and made 62 appearances before being released in 2003, having reportedly fallen out with Reid, leaving alongside the infamously inept Frenchman Lilian Laslandes. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Schwarz\">Schwarz</a> also scoops the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/410156.stm\">Funniest Contract Clause Award</a>.</p> <h2>(Relative) rags to riches</h2> <p>Hoffenheim, Hanover, Stoke. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joselu\">Joselu\u2019s</a> best days appeared behind him when he was bench-warming in the Potteries several seasons ago. After a loan at Deportivo he played two campaigns at Newcastle and three at Alav\u00e9s before continuing to Espanyol, arriving there in 2022. A respectable career looked ready to wind down before Real Madrid swooped in June the following year. During an initial loan, the striker played a part in Madrid\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/01/real-madrid-dortmund-champions-league-final-match-report\">Champions League</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/04/european-football-real-madrid-cadiz-girona-barcelona\">La Liga</a> triumphs and snaffled a place in Spain\u2019s Euro 2024 squad. \u201cWhen I was at Stoke, I don\u2019t think any player there could imagine playing at Real Madrid,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/08/real-madrids-joselu-its-true-that-everyone-hated-games-away-at-stoke\">told Sid Lowe in April</a>. \u201cI never stopped dreaming.\u201d The 34-year-old is currently turning out for Al-Gharafa in Qatar.</p> <h2>Journeyman\u2019s journey</h2> <p>Dominic Iorfa retired in 2000, by which time the occasional Nigeria international had covered some serious ground. The 22 destinations packed into his career included five in his homeland, while Belgium, England, Turkey, Scotland, Hong Kong, China and Ireland also became stamps on his passport. Iorfa settled down at Peterborough long enough for 68 appearances and 10 goals. \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Iorfa_(footballer,_born_1968)\">Dominic</a> was a lanky, speedy and hugely entertaining striker who was capable of outrageous moments,\u201d says the <a href=\"https://www.theposhtrust.co.uk/player/dominic-iorfa\">Posh Supporters Trust</a>. Waterford United, in 1999, benefited from the forward\u2019s services for 24 matches, his second-longest stint at any club. Iorfa Sr\u2019s son, Dominic, born in 1995, plays in defence for Sheffield Wednesday. He joined the Owls in 2019 and signed a new contract last summer, clearly failing to match Iorfa Sr\u2019s wanderlust.</p> <h2>Chasing the sun</h2> <p>In 1998-99 Samuel Okunowo was battling Michael Reiziger for the right-back spot at Barcelona. Ten years later he was lining up for Waltham Forest in the ninth tier of English football.

He was at Metalurh Donetsk in Ukraine from 2005-07 and after a loan at Stal Alchevsk, also in Ukraine, his next stop was VB Addu in the Maldives. Perhaps he felt some sunshine was in order after those harsh Ukrainian winters. Trials in Poland and Norway came after Waltham Forest, but no contract was forthcoming. As far as Google is concerned, Okunowo was last seen <a href=\"https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/club/news/3772815/barca-legends-en-route-to-kinshasa\">turning out for Bar\u00e7a Legends in Kinshasa in 2023</a>.</p>    <h2>Riches to rags</h2> <p>At the turn of the century M\u00e1rio Jardel had the world at his feet.

Galatasaray activated the striker\u2019s release clause and he scored five goals on his Super Lig debut before tucking away a golden goal to beat Real Madrid in the 2000 Uefa Super Cup, and eventually harvesting 34 goals that season. Jardel returned to Portugal with Sporting, where he continued to score even more regularly, netting 42 league goals in 2001-02. But a move to Sam Allardyce\u2019s Bolton sparked a flurry of unsuccessful stints across the globe as he never came close to recapturing his halcyon days. After Sporting, he played for no fewer than 14 clubs. Brief stints in Greece, Australia and Bulgaria featured as Jardel ploughed on until 2011. \u201cIn 2002 I overdosed on cocaine and was awake for seven days,\u201d Jardel revealed in 2022, which may explain his lack of success at Bolton and beyond.</p> <h2>Home, sweet home</h2> <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darko_Pan%C4%8Dev\">Darko Pancev</a> arrived at Inter in 1992 as a bona fide goal machine. Across nine seasons in his native Yugoslavia he scored 193 times, including three prolific seasons leading the line for Red Star Belgrade between 1989 and 1992. But the wheels came off when he completed a prestigious move to Italy in the days when Serie A was the richest and best league in the world. He mustered only a handful of goals in three years at Inter and was loaned to Leipzig before similarly fruitless spells in D\u00fcsseldorf and Sion. \u201cThere are strikers who don\u2019t run and there are strikers who run,\u201d Pancev recalled of the criticism he received in Italy for a perceived lack of movement. \u201cI was one of those strikers with a natural talent for scoring, and I ran only when I was within 30 metres of goal.\u201d</p> <h2>Houston, we have a \u2026</h2> <p>Cult hero Ade Akinbiyi was unfairly nicknamed \u201cAde AkinBadBuy\u201d at one of his numerous clubs.

Aside from the final jaunt to Wales, Houston was the sole club outside England. The former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan recently spoke of his regret at agreeing to Trevor Francis\u2019s idea to lure Akinbiyi to south-east London, where he scored three goals in 28 matches for the Eagles. Leaving aside the obvious Nasa-related gag, in 2009 the 34-year-old drew a blank in 14 MLS appearances for Houston and headed back to Blighty for a brief stay at Notts County before that final farewell in north Wales. Joking aside, Akinbiyi\u2019s strength of character was never in doubt. \u201cI always said I\u2019d never hide,\u201d he declared after a winner for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/nov/04/match.leicestercity\">Leicester against Sunderland in 2001</a>.</p>",

      "body": "<p><em>Bhorta</em> is, Kolkata-native<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/jul/21/asma-khan-darjeeling-express-food-is-deeply-political-who-eats-and-who-doesnt-interview\"> chef Asma Khan</a> explains, the Bengali pronunciation of the Hindi word <em>bharta</em>, meaning mashed \u2013 it\u2019s an important distinction, too, because, although spiced mashed vegetables, seafood or meat are found in many regions of the Indian subcontinent, bhorta is particularly dear to Bangladesh and the neighbouring Indian province of West Bengal.</p>    <p>Indeed, according to British Bangladeshi food writer <a href=\"https://www.whetstonemagazine.com/south-asia-journal/bhortas-are-anything-but-basic\">Dina Begum</a>, it\u2019s the \u201cquintessential soul food of Bangladeshi cuisine\u201d, repopularised by post-independence efforts to rediscover the country\u2019s culinary traditions and served with <em>panta bhat</em>, or fermented rice, at <em>P\u00f4hela Boishakh</em> (Bengali New Year) celebrations each spring.<a href=\"https://www.thespiceodyssey.com/eat/bhorta-1\"> </a>Adiba and Arafat, the husband and wife team behind <a href=\"https://www.thespiceodyssey.com/eat/bhorta-1\">the Spice Odyssey website</a>, write that: \u201cIn Bangladesh, a country marked by a huge chasm between the rich and the poor, the once austere mishmash of vegetables \u2026 has become the gamechanger \u2013 marking the return of the privileged to the food of their forefathers. The gradual incorporation of bhorta \u2026 as a celebratory food at home and abroad is a tale of how sharing common food as a ritual can become a marker of cultural and national identity.\u201d</p>    <p>Begum describes the premise of bhorta as \u201ca straightforward one. Take one ingredient. If it\u2019s simple, elevate it; if it\u2019s strong, push it to the limit.\u201d And though bhorta can be made with almost anything, seasoned with mustard oil, onions and chillies, the potato version is, Adiba says, \u201cthe most common form of bhorta in Bengali culture\u201d. Though bhorta is, inarguably, mashed potatoes, \u201cit is very different from its western counterpart\u201d, albeit just as comforting and, arguably, even more delicious. Or perhaps, because I love mash and not everything is a competition, <em>just as</em> delicious.</p> <h2>The potatoes</h2> <p>As ever where potatoes are concerned, many recipes are vague on the preferred kind, which is odd given the difference between a light and fluffy, floury spud and a dense and creamy, waxy example. Of those who do specify a preference, both Khan and Jonathan Hirshon, AKA <a href=\"https://www.thefooddictator.com/\">The Food Dictator</a>, call for floury varieties, while<a href=\"https://www.expatwoman.com/ewfood/cookery-baking/how-make-saira-hamilton%E2%80%99s-aloo-bortha-%E2%80%93-spicy-mashed-potato\"> Saira Hamilton, </a>author of My Bangladesh Kitchen, says salad spuds such as anya or charlotte are the best substitutes for the \u201cvery small and slightly pink\u201d examples used in Bangladesh. Begum agrees: \u201cBengali aloo bhorta should not be fluffy at all; it needs to be sticky and waxy.\u201d Much as I love a fluffy mash, that\u2019s a very different dish.</p>    <p>For this reason, one of Khan\u2019s suggested cooking methods \u2013 baking \u2013 is not really relevant, because I\u2019m certainly not scooping out the teaspoons of flesh from tiny roast new potatoes (though I do enjoy the results, not least because baking really is the best way to bring out the flavour and fluff of potatoes). Neither would I recommend peeling and chopping the potatoes before boiling, as<a href=\"https://www.saveur.com/recipes/aloo-bhorta-spiced-potato-mash/\"> Begum does</a> in Made in Bangladesh (or at least she does in the version of her recipe provided by Saveur magazine). Instead, boil them in their skins, both for flavour and to stop them becoming waterlogged, then rub them off once cool enough to handle.</p> <p>Begum recalls her grandmother Nani mashing the potatoes by hand in the traditional fashion on a <em>shil bata,</em> \u201ca flat slab of stone with a cylindrical stone for rolling\u201d. But the best way for most of us to achieve the required smooth, sticky finish is to get energetic with a potato masher (personally, I never get good results using a hand blender, but feel free to give that a whirl).</p> <h2>The extras</h2> <p>Every aloo bhorta, as far as I can tell, contains onion and chilli \u2013 the difference comes in whether they\u2019re used raw or cooked. With cooked onion, the chilli is often, but not always, a dry red Kashmiri variety, toasted in hot oil and then crumbled, whereas raw onion tends to be paired with a fresh green pepper.</p>    <p>As Khan makes clear by giving recipes for both in her book Asma\u2019s Indian Kitchen, it\u2019s a matter of context and preference. I love the smokiness of the charred chilli in Khan and Begum\u2019s recipes, as well as the bitter bite of the uncooked green chillies in Khan\u2019s alternative version, also used by Hamilton, so I\u2019ve included both options below. (Alternatively, if you really can\u2019t decide, you could, like Hirshon, use both cooked and raw onion in the same dish, though I think this makes it a bit dominant.)</p> <p>Brown onions are not commonly used in Bangladesh, so the popular pink onion used there is best substituted by Hamilton\u2019s shallot or Khan\u2019s red onion. Fresh coriander is often chopped into the dish for colour, and you could also add garlic to a cooked chilli version, as Khan and Hirshon do. Hirshon makes a paste from dried chilli and garlic, which helps the potato to soak up its fiery flavour, but I prefer versions in which you can taste the potato as well as the seasoning.</p> <p>Adiba adds a hard-boiled egg to her bhorta, \u201cto jazz it up \u2026 I think the combination of boiled potato and boiled eggs is just something!\u201d which is a nice idea if you want to include some protein; aloo bhorta is often served with rice and dal, so an egg never goes amiss.</p> <h2>The spices</h2>    <p>Hamilton, Khan, Adiba and Begum stick to chillies alone, while<a href=\"https://www.thefooddictator.com/the-hirshon-bangladeshi-aloo-bhorta-%E0%A6%86%E0%A6%B2%E0%A7%81-%E0%A6%AD%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%8D/\"> Hirshon adds a panch poran</a>, or five-spice mix, specially designed to suit the dish, using cumin, fenugreek, <em>radhuni</em> (for which I have to substitute celery seed), fennel and <em>kalonji</em>, or nigella seeds.</p> <p>It\u2019s an intriguingly bittersweet, aromatic blend, but, along with the asafoetida and turmeric he also uses, it overpowers the potato; good as the dish tastes, I want the main ingredient to be more than mere texture.</p> <h2>The oil</h2> <p>Whatever you cook your onion in, you must finish the dish with mustard oil, because it\u2019s the distinctive flavour of Bengal, and not one easily replaced by Khan\u2019s alternative, argan oil (which is pleasantly nutty, rather than bitter and hot). Mustard oil is still banned for sale for consumption by the UK, EU and US (and <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/mustard-oil-guide\">despite disagreement </a>over the evidence for the dangers of erucic acid), so you will probably find it labelled as \u201cfor external use only\u201d. But rest assured, many millions of people do ingest it daily without apparent ill effect. That said, I have no medical training, so if you would prefer not to take the risk, Begum recommends combining a tablespoon of vegetable oil with a teaspoon of English mustard powder as an alternative. If you want the dish to be particularly rich, you could, as Hirshon does, drizzle some ghee over the top to finish, but it shouldn\u2019t be necessary.</p>    <p>Hamilton echoes the mustard oil by stirring in a tablespoon of wholegrain mustard, too, which my testers and I all very much enjoy \u2013 it may not be traditional, though I\u2019m prepared to stand corrected on that point, but it is delicious. A few mustard seeds would also work, but are very much optional.</p> <h2>To finish</h2> <p>The dense consistency means that, to my mind, aloo bhorta looks best shaped, rather than piled haphazardly into a dish \u2013 you can sculpt it into mounds, pat it into a flat cake or shape it into little balls for easy service, as Hirshon charmingly suggests.</p> <h2>Perfect aloo bhorta</h2> <p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>20 min<br></strong>Serves <strong>4-6 as a side</strong></p> <p><strong>500g waxy potatoes</strong> (eg charlotte, anya, jersey royals)<br><strong>Salt<br>1 small red onion or large shallot</strong>, peeled and finely chopped<br><strong>1 small bunch fresh coriander</strong></p> <p>For the cooked version <br><strong>2 tbsp mustard oil<br>1 tsp black mustard seeds</strong> (optional)<br><strong>1 garlic clove</strong>, peeled and chopped (optional)<strong><br>2-4 dried red </strong><strong>kashmiri chillies</strong></p> <p>Or, for the fresh version<br><strong>1-2 green chillies</strong>, to taste, deseeded and finely chopped<br><strong>1 tbsp mustard oil</strong></p> <p>Put the potatoes, scrubbed if necessary, but not peeled, in a pan with a generous shake of salt and cover with cold water.

In 2023, she was caught up in the massive evacuation when the Wood Buffalo Complex fire broke out, burning more than <a href=\"https://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/nt/woodbuffalo/visit/wildfire-info\">500,000 hectares</a> in and around the national park. Across Canada, the 2023 wildfire season was unprecedented in its scale and intensity. Eight firefighters were killed, and about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Canadian_wildfires\">200,000 people were displaced</a>. </em></p> \n<p>We were on evacuation alert. I remember my heart racing because I was like: \u201cThis is it. This is happening.\u201d I finished my work day, went home, and I was unsure of what to do, wondering if I could stay and help.</p> \n<p>There was going to be a severe wind event the next day. They gave us an eight-hour window to evacuate, because the fire was on the highway. There is one highway into Fort Smith, and you had to drive through the fire to leave. They focused all the fire crews to keep the highway open so people could leave before the fire got too close to town. To avoid traffic, and since we have long hours of light, I was like: \u201cI\u2019ll be fine if I just leave later.\u201d</p> \n<p>I showered. I ate supper. I sat down and hung out with my boyfriend. I played some video games, and we went for a cruise around town and took pictures. I took videos of the town, because I was like: \u201cOK, here\u2019s my high school I went to.\u201d One of my best friends is painting a mural in the high school right now. I took a picture of her mural. We\u2019re the only town in the Northwest Territories with a water tower and I took a picture of that. We\u2019re the only place that has a cathedral. Just general, everyday things, where I was like \u201cHey, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s pictures of these things. I want to document this.\u201d</p> \n<p>Then I went home, packed up my vehicle, and every year on the anniversary of buying my house, I take a selfie with my house. I asked my boyfriend to come outside, and I was like: \u201cHey, come outside with me. Let\u2019s take a picture of the house. This might be the last selfie.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>I posted to TikTok something along the lines of \u201cwhen you believe your house is going to burn, you take a final selfie with it.\u201d</strong> It was just a little clip. That ended up being my first video to go viral.</p> \n<p>I\u2019m not big on social media. I like posting for me and for my close friends. Being public makes me anxious. I was really afraid, having that up there. I was torn because Meta had just introduced their policy where no news media was supposed to be online. No one knew what was happening. I felt like, if I took down my videos because of my own fear of being seen, it would be selfish. I kept them up.</p> \n<p>I was the highest viewed video for what was going on in the Northwest Territories for a while, specifically, Fort Smith. I took it down when news sources started picking up what was happening. It wasn\u2019t until Yellowknife got evacuated a week later.</p> \n<p>I packed up my vehicle, got my dogs in, and I was getting ready to leave. As a wildland firefighter, my boyfriend stayed and I took off. I hadn\u2019t seen any of the burn areas yet. As I drove through, it looked like normal burn. If you\u2019re not used to seeing forest fire burn areas, what that means is there\u2019s standing trees and burnt grass, and the trees might be a little bit darker. It was not normal later.</p> \n<p>I took a video of this massive helicopter carrying a water bucket. Nonstop helicopters overhead. All that post said was: \u201cFort Smith, Northwest Territories is evacuated due to wildfires.\u201d I took a picture of me and my dogs. I know it\u2019s morbid to be like, \u201cI want to record what\u2019s happening,\u201d but when you go through mass emotions and trauma, you start to freak out. I wanted to record things so later on I could remember. I was taking pictures and videos along the way.</p> \n<p>I didn\u2019t listen to any music. I didn\u2019t listen to any radio, nothing. I drove in silence for the three hours all the way to Hay River. I got to Hay River at 11 o\u2019clock at night, and my friends had already arrived there. They made me pizza, and we had a beer. We\u2019re sitting there, just talking about it, but the big question was like: \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d I went to bed, and I did not sleep. I was wired the whole night.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2023/01/2024-cop/climate-breakdown-reporting-team\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It was supposed to be 80km winds the next day blowing the fire towards town. The gossip was that it was going to hit town. There was no stopping it. The grief process already began, like this is it. Everything\u2019s going to be gone. The next morning, I woke up and heard the people staying with me talking about what to do. That\u2019s when they\u2019re like: \u201cWe\u2019re going to leave.\u201d I took off before my friends, because I was by myself, and I told them: \u201cI\u2019m going to get tired at some point, so I want to get as far as I can.\u201d</p> \n<p>There\u2019s two popular gas stations. I went by both of those, and there were lineups to get gas. Then I went into the industrial area, which is not paved. I pulled up to a cardlock (gas station) that accepts credit cards, and it\u2019s a place that I\u2019ve been to multiple times. I got out of the vehicle.</p> \n<p><strong>That\u2019s when it hit me: the windstorm is here. I could not keep my vehicle doors open.</strong> My legs were getting smashed in, and bruised from the doors repeatedly being blown closed on me. My face was burning, because the wind was so strong, it was whipping me in the face with sand.</p> \n<p>I have very long hair, and my hair was up and spinning in every which way. By the end of filling up my vehicle and getting in, I had a beehive. My hair was full of dirt. I couldn\u2019t run my fingers through it. It was just straight knots.</p> \n<p>I drove south. You lose cell service after a while. You\u2019re in dead zones for hours on time. It was windy, but things were fine. You can see this giant smoke plume coming from a fire from the west. The wind is blowing that fire towards us. I stopped at the 60th parallel, which is the border into the Northwest Territories from Alberta. They have a little park there.</p> \n<p>The person that takes care of that park was stressed out. I could see them pacing and walking around everywhere. I was just standing there with my dogs on a leash, watching. He kept pointing at this big smoke bloom, which looked far in the distance. Then I realized there\u2019s closer little ones not very far away. I saw those, and I was like, those are here. Those are right here.</p> \n<p>The rest of the drive to Innisfail is blurry. I just remember driving and sobbing and crying. Seeing the photos and videos of what people were going through was terrifying. That fire burnt the highway people were evacuating on. I just missed it. People were in car accidents. People lost their livestock. People were driving through flames.</p> \n<p>There was one video some teenagers had posted and they were screaming and yelling, because they were by themselves without an adult in the vehicle. I was so thankful my grandmother and her kids were not evacuating through that, but I was really, really afraid for all my extended family. I was really afraid of the death toll that was going to come out of that.</p> \n<p><strong>When we first got to Alberta, we went so far south that there was no evacuation centre and we were on our own.</strong> Soon after, word of Yellowknife being evacuated was up in the air. Eventually, because so many people were evacuating, a centre opened up in northern Edmonton, which is where my parents were.</p> \n<p>I didn\u2019t elect to take all the help that was there. I feel like I got what I needed. I think the major flaw that happened in places that received us was the lack of awareness. I get they would not know about my town but it\u2019s like, if someone had a dying parent or lost a parent, you\u2019d be very kind about it. I found a lot of people did not realize that is essentially what everyone was going through: grief. It\u2019s hard to have patience for each other when you don\u2019t realize that is actually what\u2019s occurring.</p> \n<p>We ended up all separating to not outstay our stay. I went to Sundre and stayed with my friend\u2019s family. This friend is also Indigenous. She took me on this hike that she loves, which was a turning point for me being able to release and relax. She\u2019s like: \u201cIt\u2019ll feel like healing because we\u2019re going to go to a waterfall.\u201d I told her: \u201cThat\u2019s what I want right now. I just want to be by water. I\u2019m so tired of fire.\u201d I got what I asked for, because it poured rain our whole drive up there. Absolutely poured the whole time for our hike. My friend was like: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Usually, this is nicer.\u201d I was like: \u201cNo.\u201d I needed to see rain because I don\u2019t think I saw rain all summer.</p> \n<p>I was pretty sure that we would not be permitted to go home until Hay River opened up, because there would be no groceries or anything because there\u2019s no fuel along the way. They opened up Hay River, and then they started talking about us. Then a week later we got to go home. This is where things got really emotional.</p> \n<p>South of Enterprise is a series of waterfalls that have nice boardwalks. You could see that they\u2019re burnt. That little community was full of vegetation and lush. Driving through Enterprise, it looked like a dystopian film. Everything was grey or black. You could see so many of the homes burnt. These are people on their pensions, for the most part. Enterprise is an older population. I wept for them.</p> \n<p><strong>Driving home, I saw all the areas I\u2019ve ever camped and hunted at with my family are gone.</strong> The way the fire burned, it surrounded Fort Smith. I was shocked to see how much of the highway going toward my town burnt. The pavement itself was fine.</p> \n<p>The eerie thing about the drive was the wooden telephone poles. There were just wires hanging. Some you could see little licks of fire touch the bottom. You\u2019d come across ones where it\u2019s so burnt it looks like a beaver chewing on it, with the transformer bits hanging there loosely. Then, sometimes you\u2019d come across ones where it would be burnt all the way through.</p> \n<p>I didn\u2019t receive any damage. I had power when I came home. There was no sewage issues. There\u2019s no water issues. The only thing is we did not have internet for a while.</p> \n<p>There\u2019s one major part in returning to town where I knew that if I saw it, it was going to wreck me. That area is outside of town called Salt Mountain. It\u2019s a key spot because that\u2019s where it burnt the hottest and it burnt the hardest. It looks like a nuclear bomb went off. It\u2019s decimated. There\u2019s absolutely no plants. There\u2019s absolutely no vegetation. You would never believe there was a tree there. You\u2019d never believe there was a plant there. It is white ash everywhere for as far as you can see.</p> \n<p>I won\u2019t be able to bring my children there one day and explain certain details of a place because it\u2019ll be brand new by the time they get there. When I eventually have a family, I won\u2019t be able to show them the boreal forest as a mature forest. It will be young and it\u2019d be in a totally different stage than what I got to experience. I\u2019m hoping we\u2019ll see a lot healthier forests around here now. Old growth isn\u2019t always a healthy forest. I always knew that was a threat.</p> \n<p>Hunting was really hard for people this year. You had to go so much further, and even if you went on boats, you\u2019re going into areas that are still burning. We can still see it. It\u2019s still smouldering. You can still smell it. You can see it on the highway. It\u2019s not gone. I always thought climate change was something that affected other people. Tuktoyaktuk, which is on the Arctic Ocean, is slowly eroding away due to warmer weather, less sea ice. I still view climate change as affecting the Arctic-Arctic, not me. Then, I\u2019m a victim of it.</p> \n<p><em>This testimonial was produced with the help of the <a href=\"https://climatedisasterproject.com/\">Climate Disaster Project</a>; thanks to Sean Holman, Aldyn Chwelos, Darren Schuettler, Ricardo Garcia, Cristine Gerk, Tracy Sherlock, Lisa Taylor.</em></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Design and development by</em> Harry Fischer and Pip Lev</p></li> \n</ul>",

Although the slave trade archives were unharmed, the incident has intensified concerns about rising lightning activity in the region \u2013 exacerbated by the climate crisis \u2013 and its impact on infrastructure and cultural heritage. Lightning has become a significant concern as the climate warms, according to Arlene Laing, coordinating director of the Caribbean Meteorological Organization. Research suggests global heating could increase lightning strikes by about 10% for each degree of temperature increase. Studies have shown that extreme weather events in general are increasing. Warmer air holds more moisture, creating zones of instability that can trigger more powerful rainfall, thunderstorms and flash floods, particularly in urban areas with already strained drainage systems \u2013 an increasingly recurrent phenomenon.

More frequent electrical storms can lead to fires, explosions, infrastructure damage and power outages \u2013 all carrying economic and environmental costs. The Caribbean has experienced an increase in damaging lightning strikes over the past two decades, says Laing, who oversees the Severe Weather Forecasting Programme in the Caribbean in partnership with M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France in Martinique. \u201cParticularly in countries such as Jamaica and Belize, lightning has always been an issue,\u201d Laing says. Research indicates that approximately 78% of worldwide lightning strikes occur within the latitude range of 30\u00baS to 30\u00baN, a region encompassing the Caribbean. Maracaibo, in the Venezuelan Caribbean, is considered the lightning capital of the world due to its combination of moisture, temperature, and topography. Trinidad and Tobago has faced numerous blackouts in recent years when lightning has hit power stations, affecting areas including the prime minister\u2019s office. In 2020, a lightning strike decapitated a statue at the Our Lady of Fatima Church and Marian Shrine in Trinidad.

      "bodyText": "The company behind Tokyo\u2019s renowned metro system has won a deal to take over the operation of London\u2019s Elizabeth line, replacing the incumbent Chinese-owned operator MTR. Tokyo Metro Company (TMC) has promised to bring Japanese reliability and punctuality to London\u2019s newest rail line after its consortium with the UK transport group Go-Ahead and the Japanese trading house Sumitomo Corporation beat three other bidders for the deal. The GTS Rail Operations consortium will now take over the running of the line, which opened in 2022, for at least seven years from next May. MTR, which is three-quarters owned by the Hong Kong government and operates the transport network in the administrative region of China, won the deal to manage services on the Elizabeth line in 2014 when Boris Johnson was mayor. Relations between China and the UK have deteriorated significantly since then, with this partly caused by the introduction of national security laws in Hong Kong by China\u2019s ruling Communist party. This has resulted in a crackdown on protests and civil liberties in the former British colony. The Elizabeth line, which carries about 700,000 people a day, has experienced reliability problems over the past 12 months. Between April and June, about 17% of trains arrived late, placing it 10th in the reliability score compared with other UK rail operators. TfL said the new contract would introduce the best parts of Tokyo and London to the Elizabeth line and optimise the current operation, as well as prepare the line for the increase of services when the new HS2 station at Old Oak Common opens in 2030. Japan is known for having one of the most reliable railway systems in the world, with 99% of Tokyo\u2019s metro services coming within five minutes of their scheduled time in 2022, according to one of its sustainability reports. Go-Ahead is the lead partner in the joint venture, with a 65% investment, while Tokyo Metro and Sumitomo Corporation own 17.5% each. It will be the first time that Tokyo Metro has helped to run an overseas railway operation. However, it has previously taken part in some consulting work, including helping with the development of the Hanoi metro system in Vietnam. The business has said that it is aiming to further develop its overseas railway business and participate in more operations and maintenance projects across the world. Sumitomo Corporation is a trading and investment company with a presence in 65 countries and has been involved in the sale of trains and parts to countries in Asia, as well as the US. Go-Ahead is the UK\u2019s largest train operating company, running a number of lines including Southern, Thameslink, and Gatwick Express. The deal will have the option to be extended by a further two years depending on performance. Despite opening four years after its initial completion date, the Elizabeth line, which runs from as far west as Reading to as far east as Shenfield, is one of the UK\u2019s most popular lines, with demand grow by 40% between June 2022 and October 2023. Miguel Parras, group chief executive officer of Go-Ahead, said: \u201cWe look forward to bringing our collective expertise across UK and international rail operations to London. \u201cOur objectives are aligned with TfL \u2013 to connect communities across London through safe, reliable, and sustainable public transport services, delivered to the highest level of customer satisfaction.\u201d",

      "body": "<p><strong>How did you get into comedy?<br></strong>Initially I wanted to be a comedy actress, so at 18 I went off to drama school and loved it, but I graduated into a recession. There was very little work and acting agents were nervous about signing new clients. I was totally gutted. Then a friend suggested I try standup. From my first gig (in a dingy basement to 12 people), I was utterly hooked.</p> <p><strong>Who did you admire when you were starting out?<br></strong>I have always loved French and Saunders, as a teenager I was obsessed. When I started standup, I admired people who I would see on the circuit, people ripping gigs like Kerry Godliman, Tom Allen and Zoe Lyons. I went up to the Edinburgh festival and saw acts doing incredible one-hour shows like James Acaster, Bridget Christie or Sara Pascoe. I was totally inspired from seeing great comedy shows. I still am.</p> <p><strong>What inspired your show, </strong><strong>Snappy</strong><strong>, which is now streaming?<br></strong>The jumping-off point was anxiety and parenting, and anxiety <em>about</em> parenting. I am a storytelling comic so themes in my shows have generally happened to me, whether that\u2019s embarrassing myself in front of a Spice Girl, ruining family get-togethers or accidentally breaking into a flat with my dad. You get the gist.</p> <p><strong>Where do you find material?<br></strong>My family are pretty good for material. My uncle recently described a meal as being so hot \u201cit gave his arsehole a black eye\u201d. Is that too rude for the Guardian? I always think if a story is good enough to share at the pub, I will give it a go on stage.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s been one of your all-time favourite gigs?<br></strong>Probably the first time I did Live at the Apollo, which was a TV show I grew up watching and it was my biggest ambition to one day be booked for. To take part in that show and have a great gig was honestly such a thrill. I am not embarrassed to say when I came off stage I cried with joy and relief.</p> <p><strong>Your upcoming show, </strong><strong>The Juggle</strong><strong>, is about balancing different expectations of you. What do you hope audiences take from it?<br></strong>It\u2019s good to try hard at things. It\u2019s OK to get things wrong (even if it\u2019s accidentally poisoning your neighbours). Also navigating internet trolls, why I can\u2019t get on board with space travel while kids are still going to school hungry, and that being a comedian is actually a bit of an ick \u2013 and lots more. (I promise it\u2019s really funny.)</p> <p><strong>Any bugbears from the world of comedy?<br></strong>When people say, \u201cYou can\u2019t say anything any more!\u201d You absolutely can, and many of the people saying the very worst things have comedy specials on the globe\u2019s biggest streaming platforms.</p> <p><strong>What have you learned from standup?<br></strong>That people respond well to vulnerability and honesty. Oh, and a pretty good knowledge of the UK\u2019s motorway services. Best? Tebay, by miles.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re in the back of a black cab. The driver asks, </strong><strong>\u2018What do you do?</strong><strong>\u2019 You say, </strong><strong>\u2018Comedian.</strong><strong>\u2019 They say, </strong><strong>\u2018Tell me a joke then.</strong><strong>\u2019 What do you say?<br></strong>I would never tell a cab driver I am a comedian. I always lie, I once told a cabby I was the assistant stage manager for the Lion King, then improvised the whole way home about how the different puppets work.</p> <p><strong>Can you recall a gig so bad, it\u2019s now funny?<br></strong>Following a raffle at a charity show, after a drag queen \u2013 and the audience were stood (it really is better if they are seated).

      "bodyText": "How did you get into comedy? Initially I wanted to be a comedy actress, so at 18 I went off to drama school and loved it, but I graduated into a recession. There was very little work and acting agents were nervous about signing new clients. I was totally gutted. Then a friend suggested I try standup. From my first gig (in a dingy basement to 12 people), I was utterly hooked. Who did you admire when you were starting out? I have always loved French and Saunders, as a teenager I was obsessed. When I started standup, I admired people who I would see on the circuit, people ripping gigs like Kerry Godliman, Tom Allen and Zoe Lyons. I went up to the Edinburgh festival and saw acts doing incredible one-hour shows like James Acaster, Bridget Christie or Sara Pascoe. I was totally inspired from seeing great comedy shows. I still am. What inspired your show, Snappy, which is now streaming? The jumping-off point was anxiety and parenting, and anxiety about parenting. I am a storytelling comic so themes in my shows have generally happened to me, whether that\u2019s embarrassing myself in front of a Spice Girl, ruining family get-togethers or accidentally breaking into a flat with my dad. You get the gist. Where do you find material? My family are pretty good for material. My uncle recently described a meal as being so hot \u201cit gave his arsehole a black eye\u201d. Is that too rude for the Guardian? I always think if a story is good enough to share at the pub, I will give it a go on stage. What\u2019s been one of your all-time favourite gigs? Probably the first time I did Live at the Apollo, which was a TV show I grew up watching and it was my biggest ambition to one day be booked for. To take part in that show and have a great gig was honestly such a thrill. I am not embarrassed to say when I came off stage I cried with joy and relief. Your upcoming show, The Juggle, is about balancing different expectations of you. What do you hope audiences take from it? It\u2019s good to try hard at things. It\u2019s OK to get things wrong (even if it\u2019s accidentally poisoning your neighbours). Also navigating internet trolls, why I can\u2019t get on board with space travel while kids are still going to school hungry, and that being a comedian is actually a bit of an ick \u2013 and lots more. (I promise it\u2019s really funny.) Any bugbears from the world of comedy? When people say, \u201cYou can\u2019t say anything any more!\u201d You absolutely can, and many of the people saying the very worst things have comedy specials on the globe\u2019s biggest streaming platforms. What have you learned from standup? That people respond well to vulnerability and honesty. Oh, and a pretty good knowledge of the UK\u2019s motorway services. Best? Tebay, by miles. You\u2019re in the back of a black cab. The driver asks, \u2018What do you do?\u2019 You say, \u2018Comedian.\u2019 They say, \u2018Tell me a joke then.\u2019 What do you say? I would never tell a cab driver I am a comedian. I always lie, I once told a cabby I was the assistant stage manager for the Lion King, then improvised the whole way home about how the different puppets work. Can you recall a gig so bad, it\u2019s now funny? Following a raffle at a charity show, after a drag queen \u2013 and the audience were stood (it really is better if they are seated). I got through my 20-minute set, checked my watch and I had only done seven minutes. I was so new I didn\u2019t have any other material, so I just had to riff for another 13 minutes. I could not get out of the venue quick enough. Any preshow rituals? I pace. I am a big pacer. Do you have any regrets? Non, je ne regrette rien \u2026 well, apart from every time I have ever embarrassed myself. \u2022 Snappy is out now. Suzi Ruffell\u2019s memoir Am I Having Fun Now? is out on 5 June. The Juggle is on tour from 5 June.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cShock\u201d suddenly became the most commonly uttered word in habitually nonplussed Washington DC. After Donald Trump had attempted to subvert the certification of a presidential election, incited a mob, absconded with national security secrets, was convicted as a felon, and waged his Nazi-esque \u201cpoison in the blood\u201d campaign, his brazen cabinet appointments are so mind-boggling that even hard-bitten cynics gasp.</p> <p>Sheer hypocrisy would have drawn a yawn. But Trump\u2019s cabinet selections would have startled even the character of Captain Louis Renault in Casablanca, who feigned surprise at discovering gambling in the backroom of Rick\u2019s Caf\u00e9 before pocketing his winnings: \u201cI\u2019m shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!\u201d</p> <p>If Russia occupied the United States, it would not impose a collaborationist regime of such hare-brained incompetents. Kleptocrats would be expected as commissars, but not patent lunatics. Hitler, for his part, murdered the Nazi radicals in the Night of the Long Knives to solidify his rule over the conservative establishment.</p> <p>Trump declared he would be a dictator on \u201cday one\u201d. But before day one, he has decided to empower some of the most fringe characters floating around his Maga movement. The outrageousness of his nominees is intended above all to force the subjugation of those remaining Republicans who insist on their independence. He has posed a battle royale with the Republican Senate to determine whether it will buckle under his mafia test to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/15/trump-senate-recess-appointments-explained\">recess-appoint</a> his madcap cabinet. He wants to break the Senate and crush it under his heel as his first act. Humiliation is the essence of his idea of power.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s cabinet appointments are agents of his contempt, rage and vengeance. The motive for naming his quack nominees is located in his resentments from his sordid first term for which he pledged retribution. He sees the US government in its totality as a bastion of his \u201cenemies within\u201d. He intends to shatter every department and agency, root out expertise that might contradict his whims, demolish the balancing power of the Congress that could inhibit him, and trample the law that might stand in his way.</p> <p>Wrecking the government is not only Trump\u2019s technique for gaining submission and compliance, but is his ultimate purpose. He will achieve vindication by tearing down anything he feels was used to restrain his destructive impulses or tried to hold him accountable for his past crimes, whether it is the military, the justice system or science itself.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Before the election, Trump developed two elaborate plans, one if he lost and the other if he won. In either case, he would attack the federal government. He had learned lessons from the failure of his January 6 coup. His preparation throughout 2024 to declare the election stolen and force a constitutional crisis was the underside of his campaign.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2024/nov/14/trump-brown-nosing\">Line up to kiss the ring! How to join the brownnosers sucking up to Trump | Arwa Mahdawi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In advance, he organized an extensive network of lawyers and political operatives to deny he lost, refuse to certify the election in districts and states to the point of preventing an electoral college majority, and throw the election to the House of Representatives, where the Republicans held the margin from control of state legislatures to cast 26 states for him.</p> <p>In March, Trump ousted the chair of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, because she would not divert the committee\u2019s resources into an election-denial operation and fund his legal expenses. He inserted his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, as the new head. She fired 60 staffers, but named Christina Bobb, a former far-right One America Network TV presenter, who was a key cheerleader of the fake elector scheme in 2020, as senior counsel of its election integrity unit. In April, she was indicted along with 17 other Arizona Republicans for fraud, forgery and conspiracy. Trump was named \u201cUnindicted Co-Conspirator No 1\u201d. Bobb\u2019s indictment only elevated her standing as a Trump loyalist.</p> <p>A week after Trump\u2019s election, he appointed the outside counsel for Bobb\u2019s effort, William McGinley, Trump\u2019s cabinet secretary in his first term, as his new White House counsel. In Trump\u2019s first term, his White House legal counsel, Don McGahn, had resisted his pressure to provide him with cause to fire Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, and his successor, Pat Cipollone, objected to Trump\u2019s schemes to overturn the 2020 election results. Trump at last has an in-house lawyer to tell him how to do what he wants.</p> <p>Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/13/trump-republicans-biden-transfer-of-power\">welcomed Trump</a> to the Oval Office on 13 November in a show that the transfer of power was peaceful. Biden\u2019s message was to re-establish a constitutional standard, contrasting with Trump\u2019s graceless refusal to meet with him after January 6. But the atmosphere of normalization was illusory. Biden acted as though by his example regular order could have a chance of restoration. His gesture was nostalgic.</p> <p>Minutes after Trump left Biden\u2019s presence, he announced his nomination of Matt Gaetz to be attorney general. <em>Ding, dong.</em> The clock struck 13, again and again.</p> <p>But Trump had given fair warning.</p> <p>Trump rolled out his team of travesties in the spirit he had promised. \u201cWell, revenge does take time. I will say that. And sometimes revenge can be justified,\u201d Trump said in June on Dr Phil\u2019s Fox News show. When Fox News host Sean Hannity followed up, trying to prod Trump into softening his threats, Trump rejected the opportunity. <strong>\u201c</strong>When this election is over, based on what they\u2019ve done, I would have every right to go after them,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s plan upon winning, now unfolding, is to launch a full-scale assault on the federal government from the top down. He has no need to smash into the Capitol with the Proud Boys, whom he has promised to pardon as \u201chostages\u201d.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Certain common characteristics run through his cabinet of curiosities and horrors to mark them collectively unique among any cabinet of any president \u2013 alleged sexual misconduct and abuse, drug addiction, megalomania, authoritarianism, cultism, paranoia, white supremacy, antisemitism and grifting. Some nominees meet all these qualifications, others only two, three or four. For a few, it\u2019s just plain and simple self-aggrandizing corruption.</p> <p>Each of Trump\u2019s appointees is there to savage a target on Trump\u2019s hitlist. When he came to Washington he was a relative blank slate, despite hauling a baggage train of scandal from New York. Back then, Trump blithely spoke of getting away with shooting someone on Fifth Avenue. Now, it\u2019s Pennsylvania Avenue, where six people died as a result of January 6. Trump has been in the business of making enemies of anyone trying to enforce the law. The federal cases against him will be dropped to follow the ruling of the US supreme court that he has absolute immunity for \u201cofficial actions\u201d. Liberated from accountability, Trump is building his government on revenge.</p> <p>Quite apart from his appointees\u2019 dearth of managerial experience and competence, they represent the antithesis of the core mission of the departments and agencies they have been named to oversee. They are not being appointed to run them efficiently, but to rule and ruin.</p> <p>The greatest influence in public life exercised by Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host and former national guard officer before Trump named him as secretary of defense, was in 2019 when he privately lobbied Trump and publicly advocated on Fox for pardons for three military officers convicted of war crimes, which Trump granted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/14/fox-news-government-influence\">Any line of separation between Fox News and the US government is about to vanish | Margaret Sullivan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hegseth has denounced women in the military; they make up 17.5% of active duty personnel and more than 20% of reserves. He has called for the firing of the chair of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Charles Q Brown Jr, who is Black, saying that any general \u201cinvolved in any of the DEI, woke shit has got to go\u201d.</p> <p>Hegseth was one of 12 national guard members who were removed from Biden\u2019s guard detail at his 2021 inauguration after he was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2024/11/16/pete-hegseth-tattoo-national-guard/\">deemed</a> \u201can inside threat\u201d. Hegseth\u2019s body is covered with tattoos \u2013 a Jerusalem cross, a symbol of the First Crusade, inked across his chest, and the crusader slogan \u201cDeus Vult\u201d (\u201cGod wills it\u201d) on his arm among other crusader markings. This iconography has become popular with far-right Christian nationalists and white supremacists. The Deus Vult cross <a href=\"https://uncivilreligion.org/home/the-deus-vult-cross\">flag</a> was carried by insurrectionists at the Capitol on January 6. When the tattoos were spotted by his national guard master sergeant, who <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2024-11-15/how-trumps-pentagon-pick-hegseth-fell-out-of-love-with-the-u-s-military\">wrote</a> of the \u201cdisturbing\u201d symbols to the commanding general of Washington, Hegseth was kept far from Biden.</p> <p>The Associated Press first reported the story of Hegseth\u2019s exclusion from proximity near the president.

His second wife had divorced him in September for his affair with a Fox News producer whom he had impregnated. She would give birth to a daughter in August. In October, Hegseth attended a meeting of the California Federation of Republican Women, drank at the hotel bar in the evening, and, visibly intoxicated, was assisted to his room by a female member of the group, who attended the event with her two young children and husband. Something happened. She was bruised. Hegseth claimed they had consensual sex. The police did not press charges.</p> <p>According to a memo given to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/16/pete-hegseth-sexual-assault-accuser-paid/\">Washington Post</a> by a friend of the accuser, also present at the meeting as a participant, the alleged victim and her husband hired a lawyer \u201cto ensure Hegseth didn\u2019t get off without punishment\u201d. Hegseth wound up paying her an unspecified sum of money in exchange for a non-disclosure agreement.</p> <p>Revelations of Hegseth\u2019s alleged behavior have not elicited censure from Trump, but expressions of sympathetic support for the would-be #MeToo victim. \u201cMr Hegseth has vigorously denied any and all accusations, and no charges were filed,\u201d stated the Trump transition response. Hegseth\u2019s lawyer <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/11/17/us-news/pete-hegseth-says-he-was-blackmailed-into-paying-off-rape-accuser/\">attacked</a> the woman: \u201cShe was the aggressor. She was sober, he was drunk. She took advantage of him.\u201d</p> <p>Hegseth appears to Trump as the ideal man to purge the military. Trump\u2019s transition team has drafted an executive order for a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/11/13/it-could-be-very-hard-do-our-job-top-military-officers-brace-trumps-potential-loyalty-review-boards.html\">warrior board</a>\u201d to remove any general or admiral \u201clacking in requisite leadership qualities\u201d.

Hegseth would not be the defense secretary to advise Trump against invoking the Insurrection Act to impose martial law as Mike Flynn, his disgraced former national security adviser, suggested to him shortly before January 6.</p> <p>Tulsi Gabbard, the former congresswoman nominated to be the director of national intelligence, who flipped seamlessly from far left to far right, has been steady as a rote pro-Russian propagandist, hailed on Russian state media as \u201c<a href=\"https://x.com/farhip/status/1856885349689037003\">our girlfriend</a>\u201d, and has been identified with a secretive Hare Krishna-affiliated sect called the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/tulsi-gabbard-cult-putin-democrat-science-of-identity-b2556594.html\">Science of Identity Foundation</a> that mixes vegetarianism, homophobia and Islamophobia.</p> <p>Gabbard is there to wreak havoc on Trump\u2019s phantom nemesis, the \u201cdeep state\u201d.

The TV host he fired, Tucker Carlson, is the kingmaker.</p> <p>In naming RFK Jr, Trump is reacting to his conflicts during the Covid-19 pandemic, when he wished to ignore it, dismissed mask-wearing and suggested <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/23/trump-bleach-one-year-484399\">injecting Clorox</a>. He despised the scientists who told him his ideas would not work. He hated his chief medical adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, and coronavirus response coordinator, Dr Deborah Birx \u2013 \u201call these idiots\u201d, said Trump.</p> <p>Trump also fired Dr Rick Bright, the director of the Center for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority in charge of vaccine development, for refusing to approve the use of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for Covid-19, which Bright <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/22/politics/read-whistleblower-vaccine-development/index.html\">protested</a> was one of several \u201cpotentially dangerous drugs promoted by those with political connections\u201d. Bright testified in May 2020 before Congress that the Trump administration had \u201cno master plan\u201d, that the country faced \u201cthe darkest winter in our history\u201d and that in the absence of national leadership, \u201cour window of opportunity is closing.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has not appointed RFK Jr for his famous name, though he must receive gratification from possessing for himself this piece of the Kennedy legacy, however tarnished. Bobby Kennedy Jr is there because he says that he will fire 600 experts at the National Institutes of Health, the foremost medical research center in the world \u2013 \u201call these idiots\u201d. And Tucker Carlson vouches for him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/15/outrageous-appointments-donald-trump-anti-vaxxer\">With these outrageous appointments, Trump is showing us exactly how he intends to rule | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tangled resentments of Trump\u2019s appointees are cardinal virtues, especially when they overlap with his own grievances. Trump, the adjudicated rapist, credibly accused by dozens of women of sexual assault, whom the sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-describes-donald-trump-000845379.html\">called</a> his \u201cclosest friend for 10 years\u201d, identifies with Matt Gaetz fending off investigations of his alleged sex crimes. After Trump confided in Reince Priebus, his first chief of staff, that he would pick Gaetz, Priebus <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/trump-told-abcs-reince-priebus-his-matt-gaetz-pick-is-for-real-a-big-middle-finger-to-the-doj/\">concluded</a>: \u201cSo, he [Trump] feels like he has gone to hell and back 10 times. So, this is also a big middle finger to the DoJ and the FBI.\u201d</p> <p>At the end of the first Trump administration, Gaetz desperately sought to secure an all-purpose pardon to cover him from the then ongoing federal inquiry into alleged sex trafficking of minors to his alleged participation as a co-conspirator in Trump\u2019s coup. He approached, among others, the deputy White House legal counsel, Eric Herschmann, who testified before the January 6 committee. \u201cThe pardon that he was discussing, requesting was as broad as you could describe,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/17/politics/matt-gaetz-trump-pardon-justice-department/index.html\">stated</a>. \u201cFrom beginning \u2013 I remember he said, from the beginning of time up until today for any and all things.

The next day, Gaetz <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/13/trump-matt-gaetz-attorney-general\">resigned from Congress</a>. The day following that, the House ethics committee report on Gaetz\u2019s alleged sex crimes was scheduled to be released. But because Gaetz is no longer a member of the House, Speaker Mike Johnson, serving as Trump\u2019s handyman, \u201cstrongly requested\u201d that it would violate House rules to make the report public despite precedents to the contrary. He warned it would \u201copen a Pandora\u2019s box\u201d, presumably of other dark secrets about Gaetz and perhaps other nominees.</p> <p>Democratic and Republican senators on the judiciary committee that will hold confirmation hearings have asked for the report.

He has made confusing, possibly conspiratorial claims about 9/11 and suggested that January 6 was \u201can inside job\u201d. During his campaign, he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/13/us/politics/vivek-ramaswamy-dismantle-government.html\">stated</a> that his goal was to fire 75% of the federal workforce in short order. Merely a charlatan and a demagogue, Ramaswamy does not stand out as especially peculiar among the wholly unqualified Trump nominees.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s appointment of Doug Burgum, the billionaire governor of North Dakota, as secretary of the interior and \u201cenergy czar\u201d, fits the profile of old-fashioned plunder. In April, Burgum gathered oil and gas executives at Mar-a-Lago, where Trump flagrantly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/03/trump-big-oil-campaign-pitch-corruption\">asked for $1bn in campaign contributions</a> in exchange for tax breaks and favorable policies.</p> <p>Harold G Hamm, chair of Continental Resources, an independent oil company, who is an investor in a proposed $5.2bn pipeline in North Dakota, helped Burgum organize the meeting. Burgum\u2019s family holds land that profits from Hamm\u2019s business. \u201cObviously it\u2019s no secret that I helped gather the industry up, oil and gas producers and the entire industry,\u201d Hamm <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-harold-hamm-top-oil-164300562.html\">said</a>. He handed Trump a list of more than 100 policies he wanted implemented. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more thrilled by president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory,\u201d Hamm remarked. Then, Trump named as secretary of energy a fracking equipment company executive, Chris Wright, who has declared: \u201cThere is no climate crisis.\u201d</p> <p>The volatile elements of petroleum, public lands and leasing deals evoke a scenario from a century ago, of a cabinet appointed by a president who promised to restore the country to its greatness in a \u201creturn to normalcy\u201d.

It was the worst cabinet scandal in history. Make Teapot Dome Again.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Trump seeks to install his cabinet by circumventing the Senate. He insists that the Republican leadership forgo its constitutional duty to advise and consent and instead allow his picks to assume their positions as recess appointments. Trump is also blocking the FBI from conducting background checks. His cabinet nominations have become his instrument for intimidation. He intends to sweep aside checks and balances for one-man rule.</p> <p>The appointment of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida as secretary of state illustrates the kind of behavior Trump wishes to encourage among Republican senators. During the 2016 Republican primaries, Rubio derided Trump for his \u201csmall hands\u201d, a signifier for his genitals. \u201cYou know what they say about men with small hands?\u201d Rubio jibed.</p> <p>But after Trump was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/30/trump-trial-hush-money-verdict\">convicted of 34 felonies</a> in New York for paying hush money to an adult film actorto influence the 2016 election, Rubio leaped to blame Biden falsely for Trump\u2019s prosecution.

      "bodyText": "\u201cShock\u201d suddenly became the most commonly uttered word in habitually nonplussed Washington DC. After Donald Trump had attempted to subvert the certification of a presidential election, incited a mob, absconded with national security secrets, was convicted as a felon, and waged his Nazi-esque \u201cpoison in the blood\u201d campaign, his brazen cabinet appointments are so mind-boggling that even hard-bitten cynics gasp. Sheer hypocrisy would have drawn a yawn. But Trump\u2019s cabinet selections would have startled even the character of Captain Louis Renault in Casablanca, who feigned surprise at discovering gambling in the backroom of Rick\u2019s Caf\u00e9 before pocketing his winnings: \u201cI\u2019m shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!\u201d If Russia occupied the United States, it would not impose a collaborationist regime of such hare-brained incompetents. Kleptocrats would be expected as commissars, but not patent lunatics. Hitler, for his part, murdered the Nazi radicals in the Night of the Long Knives to solidify his rule over the conservative establishment. Trump declared he would be a dictator on \u201cday one\u201d. But before day one, he has decided to empower some of the most fringe characters floating around his Maga movement. The outrageousness of his nominees is intended above all to force the subjugation of those remaining Republicans who insist on their independence. He has posed a battle royale with the Republican Senate to determine whether it will buckle under his mafia test to recess-appoint his madcap cabinet. He wants to break the Senate and crush it under his heel as his first act. Humiliation is the essence of his idea of power. Trump\u2019s cabinet appointments are agents of his contempt, rage and vengeance. The motive for naming his quack nominees is located in his resentments from his sordid first term for which he pledged retribution. He sees the US government in its totality as a bastion of his \u201cenemies within\u201d. He intends to shatter every department and agency, root out expertise that might contradict his whims, demolish the balancing power of the Congress that could inhibit him, and trample the law that might stand in his way. Wrecking the government is not only Trump\u2019s technique for gaining submission and compliance, but is his ultimate purpose. He will achieve vindication by tearing down anything he feels was used to restrain his destructive impulses or tried to hold him accountable for his past crimes, whether it is the military, the justice system or science itself. *** Before the election, Trump developed two elaborate plans, one if he lost and the other if he won. In either case, he would attack the federal government. He had learned lessons from the failure of his January 6 coup. His preparation throughout 2024 to declare the election stolen and force a constitutional crisis was the underside of his campaign. In advance, he organized an extensive network of lawyers and political operatives to deny he lost, refuse to certify the election in districts and states to the point of preventing an electoral college majority, and throw the election to the House of Representatives, where the Republicans held the margin from control of state legislatures to cast 26 states for him. In March, Trump ousted the chair of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, because she would not divert the committee\u2019s resources into an election-denial operation and fund his legal expenses. He inserted his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, as the new head. She fired 60 staffers, but named Christina Bobb, a former far-right One America Network TV presenter, who was a key cheerleader of the fake elector scheme in 2020, as senior counsel of its election integrity unit. In April, she was indicted along with 17 other Arizona Republicans for fraud, forgery and conspiracy. Trump was named \u201cUnindicted Co-Conspirator No 1\u201d. Bobb\u2019s indictment only elevated her standing as a Trump loyalist. A week after Trump\u2019s election, he appointed the outside counsel for Bobb\u2019s effort, William McGinley, Trump\u2019s cabinet secretary in his first term, as his new White House counsel. In Trump\u2019s first term, his White House legal counsel, Don McGahn, had resisted his pressure to provide him with cause to fire Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, and his successor, Pat Cipollone, objected to Trump\u2019s schemes to overturn the 2020 election results. Trump at last has an in-house lawyer to tell him how to do what he wants. Joe Biden welcomed Trump to the Oval Office on 13 November in a show that the transfer of power was peaceful. Biden\u2019s message was to re-establish a constitutional standard, contrasting with Trump\u2019s graceless refusal to meet with him after January 6. But the atmosphere of normalization was illusory. Biden acted as though by his example regular order could have a chance of restoration. His gesture was nostalgic. Minutes after Trump left Biden\u2019s presence, he announced his nomination of Matt Gaetz to be attorney general. Ding, dong. The clock struck 13, again and again. But Trump had given fair warning. Trump rolled out his team of travesties in the spirit he had promised. \u201cWell, revenge does take time. I will say that. And sometimes revenge can be justified,\u201d Trump said in June on Dr Phil\u2019s Fox News show. When Fox News host Sean Hannity followed up, trying to prod Trump into softening his threats, Trump rejected the opportunity. \u201cWhen this election is over, based on what they\u2019ve done, I would have every right to go after them,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s plan upon winning, now unfolding, is to launch a full-scale assault on the federal government from the top down. He has no need to smash into the Capitol with the Proud Boys, whom he has promised to pardon as \u201chostages\u201d. *** Certain common characteristics run through his cabinet of curiosities and horrors to mark them collectively unique among any cabinet of any president \u2013 alleged sexual misconduct and abuse, drug addiction, megalomania, authoritarianism, cultism, paranoia, white supremacy, antisemitism and grifting. Some nominees meet all these qualifications, others only two, three or four. For a few, it\u2019s just plain and simple self-aggrandizing corruption. Each of Trump\u2019s appointees is there to savage a target on Trump\u2019s hitlist. When he came to Washington he was a relative blank slate, despite hauling a baggage train of scandal from New York. Back then, Trump blithely spoke of getting away with shooting someone on Fifth Avenue. Now, it\u2019s Pennsylvania Avenue, where six people died as a result of January 6. Trump has been in the business of making enemies of anyone trying to enforce the law. The federal cases against him will be dropped to follow the ruling of the US supreme court that he has absolute immunity for \u201cofficial actions\u201d. Liberated from accountability, Trump is building his government on revenge. Quite apart from his appointees\u2019 dearth of managerial experience and competence, they represent the antithesis of the core mission of the departments and agencies they have been named to oversee. They are not being appointed to run them efficiently, but to rule and ruin. The greatest influence in public life exercised by Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host and former national guard officer before Trump named him as secretary of defense, was in 2019 when he privately lobbied Trump and publicly advocated on Fox for pardons for three military officers convicted of war crimes, which Trump granted. Hegseth has denounced women in the military; they make up 17.5% of active duty personnel and more than 20% of reserves. He has called for the firing of the chair of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Charles Q Brown Jr, who is Black, saying that any general \u201cinvolved in any of the DEI, woke shit has got to go\u201d. Hegseth was one of 12 national guard members who were removed from Biden\u2019s guard detail at his 2021 inauguration after he was deemed \u201can inside threat\u201d. Hegseth\u2019s body is covered with tattoos \u2013 a Jerusalem cross, a symbol of the First Crusade, inked across his chest, and the crusader slogan \u201cDeus Vult\u201d (\u201cGod wills it\u201d) on his arm among other crusader markings. This iconography has become popular with far-right Christian nationalists and white supremacists. The Deus Vult cross flag was carried by insurrectionists at the Capitol on January 6. When the tattoos were spotted by his national guard master sergeant, who wrote of the \u201cdisturbing\u201d symbols to the commanding general of Washington, Hegseth was kept far from Biden. The Associated Press first reported the story of Hegseth\u2019s exclusion from proximity near the president. JD Vance attacked the news organization, tweeting: \u201cdisgusting anti-Christian bigotry from the AP\u201d. In 2017, Hegseth was the subject of a police investigation for rape in Monterey, California. His second wife had divorced him in September for his affair with a Fox News producer whom he had impregnated. She would give birth to a daughter in August. In October, Hegseth attended a meeting of the California Federation of Republican Women, drank at the hotel bar in the evening, and, visibly intoxicated, was assisted to his room by a female member of the group, who attended the event with her two young children and husband. Something happened. She was bruised. Hegseth claimed they had consensual sex. The police did not press charges. According to a memo given to the Washington Post by a friend of the accuser, also present at the meeting as a participant, the alleged victim and her husband hired a lawyer \u201cto ensure Hegseth didn\u2019t get off without punishment\u201d. Hegseth wound up paying her an unspecified sum of money in exchange for a non-disclosure agreement. Revelations of Hegseth\u2019s alleged behavior have not elicited censure from Trump, but expressions of sympathetic support for the would-be #MeToo victim. \u201cMr Hegseth has vigorously denied any and all accusations, and no charges were filed,\u201d stated the Trump transition response. Hegseth\u2019s lawyer attacked the woman: \u201cShe was the aggressor. She was sober, he was drunk. She took advantage of him.\u201d Hegseth appears to Trump as the ideal man to purge the military. Trump\u2019s transition team has drafted an executive order for a \u201cwarrior board\u201d to remove any general or admiral \u201clacking in requisite leadership qualities\u201d. Trump complained to his chief of staff Gen John Kelly that he wanted \u201cmy generals\u201d to be more like \u201cHitler\u2019s generals\u201d. Hegseth would be his enforcer of politicizing the military so that it never questioned any illegal behavior, like violating the War Crimes Act, or refusing an order to open fire on American protesters. \u201cCan\u2019t you just shoot them, just shoot them in the legs or something?\u201d Trump said to Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs, in the presence of the secretary of defense, Mark Esper, about demonstrators after George Floyd\u2019s murder in 2020. Hegseth would not be the defense secretary to advise Trump against invoking the Insurrection Act to impose martial law as Mike Flynn, his disgraced former national security adviser, suggested to him shortly before January 6. Tulsi Gabbard, the former congresswoman nominated to be the director of national intelligence, who flipped seamlessly from far left to far right, has been steady as a rote pro-Russian propagandist, hailed on Russian state media as \u201cour girlfriend\u201d, and has been identified with a secretive Hare Krishna-affiliated sect called the Science of Identity Foundation that mixes vegetarianism, homophobia and Islamophobia. Gabbard is there to wreak havoc on Trump\u2019s phantom nemesis, the \u201cdeep state\u201d. His first director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, a former Republican senator from Indiana, closely observed Trump\u2019s relationship with Vladimir Putin, which he told Bob Woodward was \u201cso strange\u201d, \u201cso subservient\u201d. \u201cIs this blackmail?\u201d Coats wondered. Trump recalls that his first impeachment was the result of a whistleblower complaint from an analyst from the office of the director of national intelligence, who filed a memo about a phone call Trump had with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in which he sought to coerce him into manufacturing political dirt about Biden in exchange for defensive Javelin missiles already approved by the Congress. \u201cI would like you to do us a favor,\u201d said Trump in what he insisted was a \u201cperfect phone call\u201d. Trump was furious at the exposure of his blackmail. \u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person who gave the whistle-blower the information because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right?\u201d Now he will send Gabbard to terminate the \u201cspies\u201d of the \u201cdeep state\u201d. Robert F Kennedy Jr, nominated as secretary of health and human services, is an opponent of the scientific method for which he reflexively substitutes a priori conspiracy theories. He has grifted millions on bogus claims that vaccines cause autism. \u201cThere is no vaccine that is safe and effective,\u201d he said. A decades-long heroin addict and self-confessed sex addict, he has a family who has tried to lift him out of his turmoil, staging interventions for years to have him professionally treated for his psychological troubles, but have been reduced to despair. He claims that his family members have succumbed to \u201chypnosis\u201d. During the campaign, a family babysitter emerged to accuse Kennedy of numerous sexual assaults. He claimed he had \u201cno memory of this incident but I apologize sincerely\u201d. He said in an interview: \u201cI\u2019m not a church boy.\u201d Meanwhile, he was reportedly involved in an affair with Olivia Nuzzi, a writer for New York Magazine, which cost her her fiance and job. Three other women stepped forward to claim they had sexual affairs with him after meeting him through his anti-vaccine group, the Children\u2019s Health Defense, and at the same time he was involved with Nuzzi, which he denied. But RFK Jr, is promoted by Tucker Carlson and his trailing entourage of lost boys, Don Jr and JD Vance. Carlson and Don Jr persuaded Bobby to drop his third-party candidacy and to endorse Trump. On 31 October, at a rally in Glendale, Arizona, Carlson interviewed Trump and asked him pointedly whether he would appoint Bobby. On 1 November, RFK Jr appeared on the Tucker Carlson Live Tour, where he told a rapturous crowd that in answer to his prayers for the fulfillment of his personal destiny: \u201cGod sent me Donald Trump.\u201d Before the election, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Wall Street Journal editorial page confidently informed its readers that Trump\u2019s bizarre statements and inclinations were not to be taken seriously, and that in any event would be blocked by \u201cchecks and balances\u201d. After Trump was elected, the Journal has been stunned by the nominations of Gaetz and RFK Jr. \u201cGood luck making sense of this nomination,\u201d it editorialized about Bobby. \u201cMatt Gaetz is a bad choice for attorney general,\u201d ran another thundering piece. Murdoch is out in the cold. The TV host he fired, Tucker Carlson, is the kingmaker. In naming RFK Jr, Trump is reacting to his conflicts during the Covid-19 pandemic, when he wished to ignore it, dismissed mask-wearing and suggested injecting Clorox. He despised the scientists who told him his ideas would not work. He hated his chief medical adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, and coronavirus response coordinator, Dr Deborah Birx \u2013 \u201call these idiots\u201d, said Trump. Trump also fired Dr Rick Bright, the director of the Center for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority in charge of vaccine development, for refusing to approve the use of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for Covid-19, which Bright protested was one of several \u201cpotentially dangerous drugs promoted by those with political connections\u201d. Bright testified in May 2020 before Congress that the Trump administration had \u201cno master plan\u201d, that the country faced \u201cthe darkest winter in our history\u201d and that in the absence of national leadership, \u201cour window of opportunity is closing.\u201d Trump has not appointed RFK Jr for his famous name, though he must receive gratification from possessing for himself this piece of the Kennedy legacy, however tarnished. Bobby Kennedy Jr is there because he says that he will fire 600 experts at the National Institutes of Health, the foremost medical research center in the world \u2013 \u201call these idiots\u201d. And Tucker Carlson vouches for him. The tangled resentments of Trump\u2019s appointees are cardinal virtues, especially when they overlap with his own grievances. Trump, the adjudicated rapist, credibly accused by dozens of women of sexual assault, whom the sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein called his \u201cclosest friend for 10 years\u201d, identifies with Matt Gaetz fending off investigations of his alleged sex crimes. After Trump confided in Reince Priebus, his first chief of staff, that he would pick Gaetz, Priebus concluded: \u201cSo, he [Trump] feels like he has gone to hell and back 10 times. So, this is also a big middle finger to the DoJ and the FBI.\u201d At the end of the first Trump administration, Gaetz desperately sought to secure an all-purpose pardon to cover him from the then ongoing federal inquiry into alleged sex trafficking of minors to his alleged participation as a co-conspirator in Trump\u2019s coup. He approached, among others, the deputy White House legal counsel, Eric Herschmann, who testified before the January 6 committee. \u201cThe pardon that he was discussing, requesting was as broad as you could describe,\u201d he stated. \u201cFrom beginning \u2013 I remember he said, from the beginning of time up until today for any and all things. He had mentioned Nixon, and I said Nixon\u2019s pardon was never nearly that broad.\u201d In October 2023, Congressman Gaetz provoked the removal of Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House. \u201cI\u2019ll give you the truth why I\u2019m not speaker,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cIt\u2019s because one person, a member of Congress, wanted me to stop an ethics complaint because he slept with a 17-year-old.\u201d On 13 November, Trump named Gaetz attorney general. The next day, Gaetz resigned from Congress. The day following that, the House ethics committee report on Gaetz\u2019s alleged sex crimes was scheduled to be released. But because Gaetz is no longer a member of the House, Speaker Mike Johnson, serving as Trump\u2019s handyman, \u201cstrongly requested\u201d that it would violate House rules to make the report public despite precedents to the contrary. He warned it would \u201copen a Pandora\u2019s box\u201d, presumably of other dark secrets about Gaetz and perhaps other nominees. Democratic and Republican senators on the judiciary committee that will hold confirmation hearings have asked for the report. It remains bottled up. *** Trump does not attempt to hide his intention to \u201cdismantle government bureaucracy\u201d and \u201csend shockwaves through the system\u201d, as he tweeted in his appointment of \u201cthe Great Elon Musk\u201d and Vivek Ramaswamy (no \u201cGreat\u201d preceding his name), assigned to rampage through the entire government as a \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d. Musk has a long history of conflicts with government regulatory agencies and outstanding unresolved investigations, including a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into inside stock trading. Musk\u2019s commission is transparently a case of self-interest. \u201cDoge\u201d, as it is called, after \u201cdogecoin\u201d, a cryptocurrency that Musk has been hawking, is not at all a department, which would require FBI background checks. Musk orbits on a cocktail of LSD, cocaine, ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms, \u201coften at private parties around the world, where attendees sign nondisclosure agreements or give up their phones to enter\u201d, according to people who spoke to the Wall Street Journal. He speaks privately to Vladimir Putin. During the campaign, he turned Twitter/X into a cesspool of disinformation, a good deal of his own fabrication and streams of it from Russian troll farms. Inexplicably, he continues to hold a security clearance as a government contractor that has not been suspended under review during the Biden administration. Ramaswamy, a venture capitalist and libertarian ideologue who ran for the Republican nomination for president on a platform of abolishing numerous federal agencies from the IRS to the FBI, is completely inexperienced in government affairs, which he has been tasked to reform. He has made confusing, possibly conspiratorial claims about 9/11 and suggested that January 6 was \u201can inside job\u201d. During his campaign, he stated that his goal was to fire 75% of the federal workforce in short order. Merely a charlatan and a demagogue, Ramaswamy does not stand out as especially peculiar among the wholly unqualified Trump nominees. Trump\u2019s appointment of Doug Burgum, the billionaire governor of North Dakota, as secretary of the interior and \u201cenergy czar\u201d, fits the profile of old-fashioned plunder. In April, Burgum gathered oil and gas executives at Mar-a-Lago, where Trump flagrantly asked for $1bn in campaign contributions in exchange for tax breaks and favorable policies. Harold G Hamm, chair of Continental Resources, an independent oil company, who is an investor in a proposed $5.2bn pipeline in North Dakota, helped Burgum organize the meeting. Burgum\u2019s family holds land that profits from Hamm\u2019s business. \u201cObviously it\u2019s no secret that I helped gather the industry up, oil and gas producers and the entire industry,\u201d Hamm said. He handed Trump a list of more than 100 policies he wanted implemented. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more thrilled by president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory,\u201d Hamm remarked. Then, Trump named as secretary of energy a fracking equipment company executive, Chris Wright, who has declared: \u201cThere is no climate crisis.\u201d The volatile elements of petroleum, public lands and leasing deals evoke a scenario from a century ago, of a cabinet appointed by a president who promised to restore the country to its greatness in a \u201creturn to normalcy\u201d. During the Warren G Harding presidency, the secretary of the interior, Albert B Fall, accepted kickbacks from oil companies in granting oil leases and became the first cabinet member to be sentenced to prison. It was the worst cabinet scandal in history. Make Teapot Dome Again. *** Trump seeks to install his cabinet by circumventing the Senate. He insists that the Republican leadership forgo its constitutional duty to advise and consent and instead allow his picks to assume their positions as recess appointments. Trump is also blocking the FBI from conducting background checks. His cabinet nominations have become his instrument for intimidation. He intends to sweep aside checks and balances for one-man rule. The appointment of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida as secretary of state illustrates the kind of behavior Trump wishes to encourage among Republican senators. During the 2016 Republican primaries, Rubio derided Trump for his \u201csmall hands\u201d, a signifier for his genitals. \u201cYou know what they say about men with small hands?\u201d Rubio jibed. But after Trump was convicted of 34 felonies in New York for paying hush money to an adult film actorto influence the 2016 election, Rubio leaped to blame Biden falsely for Trump\u2019s prosecution. Rubio tweeted: \u201cOur current President is a demented man propped up by wicked &amp; deranged people willing to destroy our country to remain in power.\u201d He added, with flaming emojis: \u201cIt\u2019s time to fight [fire] with [fire].\u201d Subservience has now received its reward. Rubio, \u201cLittle Marco\u201d, the most conventional of Trump\u2019s cabinet choices, is an example to them all.

      "body": "<p>Did the Democrats really lose because they were too \u201cwoke\u201d, too obsessed with minorities, too radical? After defeat, there always comes the battle for the narrative about why the party lost. As the US left is rediscovering, the most influential voices tend to be those platformed by corporate media outlets whose siren cry is always to march rightwards. And yet even the New York Times concluded that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/us/politics/harris-trump-economy.html\">one of the main problems</a> was in fact Kamala Harris\u2019s \u201cWall Street-approved economic pitch\u201d, which her brother-in-law \u2013 chief legal officer at Uber \u2013 reportedly helped craft, and which \u201cfell flat\u201d.</p> <p>The liberal order, always riddled with hypocrisies and illusions, is collapsing, partly because mainstream liberals cannot be trusted to defend liberalism: they are set to conclude that Trumpism must be defeated through imitation. But here\u2019s a polling fact that cannot be ignored. In the past 50 years, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73a1836d-0faa-4c84-b973-554e2ca3a227\">number of Americans who believe the Democrats</a> \u201crepresent the working class\u201d has plummeted, while the numbers who believe they \u201cstand up for marginalised groups\u201d has dramatically risen, now exceeding the former.</p> <p>This is what happens if you lack a convincing economic vision to uplift the working class \u2013 in all its diversity \u2013 as a whole. Even if your commitment to minority rights is superficial and rhetorical, your rightwing opponents will tell Americans that your interest is reserved for \u201cmarginalised groups\u201d rather than \u201cthe average Joe\u201d. Or as one Republican attack ad put it: \u201cKamala is for they/them; President Trump is for you.\u201d</p> <p>This is a feature, not a bug, with the Democrats. Since the civil rights era, they have been a coalition including a chunk of corporate America, a shrinking labour movement and minorities. This cross-class alliance stopped them offering European-style social democracy, which would mean hiking taxes on their wealthy backers. In fact, under the <a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/docview/1978456135?sourcetype=Scholarly%20Journals\">Democratic administrations of John F Kennedy and Lyndon B Johnson</a> in the 60s, hefty tax cuts benefited big businesses and affluent Americans the most. While the tax burden of the average US family nearly doubled between the 1950s and the election of Ronald Reagan, corporate taxes as a share of gross federal receipts <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/95dec/conbook/fergrt.htm\">fell by a third</a>.</p> <p>This means that the big government spending projects of those eras, like the anti-poverty measures of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/22/lyndon-johnson-anniversary-death-awful-man-my-political-hero\">the Great Society</a>, were largely paid for by middle-income Americans. This encouraged a backlash against the beneficiaries of the programmes, demonised as the undeserving Black poor.</p> <p>In this context, white American workers became increasingly associated with conservatism, as converts to Richard Nixon\u2019s Republicans and the segregationist George Wallace. \u201cThe typical worker \u2013 from construction craftsman to shoe clerk,\u201d wrote New York Times labour correspondent AH Raskin in 1968, \u201chas become probably the most reactionary political force in the country.\u201d But as the working-class writer Andrew Levison wrote a few years later: \u201cThere is nothing strange in the fact that workers began deserting liberalism once liberalism so decisively deserted them.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/19/kamala-harris-democrats-anti-establishment-election\">Why Kamala Harris couldn\u2019t convince an anti-establishment America | Samuel Hammond</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are obvious differences today.

      "bodyText": "Did the Democrats really lose because they were too \u201cwoke\u201d, too obsessed with minorities, too radical? After defeat, there always comes the battle for the narrative about why the party lost. As the US left is rediscovering, the most influential voices tend to be those platformed by corporate media outlets whose siren cry is always to march rightwards. And yet even the New York Times concluded that one of the main problems was in fact Kamala Harris\u2019s \u201cWall Street-approved economic pitch\u201d, which her brother-in-law \u2013 chief legal officer at Uber \u2013 reportedly helped craft, and which \u201cfell flat\u201d. The liberal order, always riddled with hypocrisies and illusions, is collapsing, partly because mainstream liberals cannot be trusted to defend liberalism: they are set to conclude that Trumpism must be defeated through imitation. But here\u2019s a polling fact that cannot be ignored. In the past 50 years, the number of Americans who believe the Democrats \u201crepresent the working class\u201d has plummeted, while the numbers who believe they \u201cstand up for marginalised groups\u201d has dramatically risen, now exceeding the former. This is what happens if you lack a convincing economic vision to uplift the working class \u2013 in all its diversity \u2013 as a whole. Even if your commitment to minority rights is superficial and rhetorical, your rightwing opponents will tell Americans that your interest is reserved for \u201cmarginalised groups\u201d rather than \u201cthe average Joe\u201d. Or as one Republican attack ad put it: \u201cKamala is for they/them; President Trump is for you.\u201d This is a feature, not a bug, with the Democrats. Since the civil rights era, they have been a coalition including a chunk of corporate America, a shrinking labour movement and minorities. This cross-class alliance stopped them offering European-style social democracy, which would mean hiking taxes on their wealthy backers. In fact, under the Democratic administrations of John F Kennedy and Lyndon B Johnson in the 60s, hefty tax cuts benefited big businesses and affluent Americans the most. While the tax burden of the average US family nearly doubled between the 1950s and the election of Ronald Reagan, corporate taxes as a share of gross federal receipts fell by a third. This means that the big government spending projects of those eras, like the anti-poverty measures of the Great Society, were largely paid for by middle-income Americans. This encouraged a backlash against the beneficiaries of the programmes, demonised as the undeserving Black poor. In this context, white American workers became increasingly associated with conservatism, as converts to Richard Nixon\u2019s Republicans and the segregationist George Wallace. \u201cThe typical worker \u2013 from construction craftsman to shoe clerk,\u201d wrote New York Times labour correspondent AH Raskin in 1968, \u201chas become probably the most reactionary political force in the country.\u201d But as the working-class writer Andrew Levison wrote a few years later: \u201cThere is nothing strange in the fact that workers began deserting liberalism once liberalism so decisively deserted them.\u201d There are obvious differences today. The previous backlash against liberal failures paved the way to Reaganism, which did at least offer a coherent vision for society. Trumpism, on the other hand, is more emblematic of what the American literary critic Lionel Trilling said of US conservatism in 1950, that it was a series of \u201cirritable mental gestures\u201d, defined by fiery opposition to perceived progressive sensibilities rather than a cogent plan for what the US could look like. Policies that favour wealthier Americans \u2013 rather than many of the struggling Americans who voted for Trump \u2013 piggyback on this emotive backlash. But Kamala Harris made her dividing lines abortion rights and the defence of democracy: crucial questions, no doubt, but not answers to the struggles of workers on stagnating wages.

The Democrats need a plan that unites the shared interests of low- and middle-income Americans in an age of crisis and turmoil.

The political centre of gravity had shifted, leaving the Democrats behind an American public clamoring for more energised government. To stave off the long-run threat of Trumpism, Democrats had to abandon centrist politics and embrace a new policy playbook, a return of the state guided by Roosevelt\u2019s principles of \u201cbold, persistent experimentation\u201d.

It helped revive beleaguered unions, and \u201cproduced an industrial policy that aims to reshape the American economy\u201d, with immediate results: investment in manufacturing facilities more than doubled, soaring to its highest on recent historical record.

      "body": "<p>Stay With Me is a brief novel, but the whole is overshadowed by fear. The narrator, a Norwegian novelist living in Milan, recalls her childhood in the book\u2019s opening pages, the constant threat of her father\u2019s violence, its eruptions the more fearsome for being random, unpredictable. \u201cThe world was hard. Wrong was wrong. When it could have&nbsp;been right. Afraid was a state of being. I don\u2019t know when it started. All&nbsp;I know is that I was afraid, afraid was a skin beneath my skin that couldn\u2019t be shed.\u201d</p> <p>Hanne \u00d8rstavik\u2019s novel addresses the question of whether a fear that springs from such a deep well can ever be shed. The nameless narrator is a&nbsp;widow; a year earlier her husband, an&nbsp;Italian musician referred to as L, died far too young. She is not free of her grief, but she meets M, who at 35 is 17&nbsp;years younger than she is, and embarks on an affair. He is removed from her world of music and literature and gallery openings; his ambition is to own a Land Rover Defender. The contrast frees her from herself to a certain extent, and what\u2019s not to like about hot sex with a younger man? But she questions his desire for her and she comes to fear the rage that can erupt from him, an echo of what she witnessed as a little girl.</p> <p>In parallel, the narrator is writing a&nbsp;novel, about \u201cJudith\u201d and \u201cMyrto\u201d, characters who reflect her own life and&nbsp;that of her late husband, tracking the rupture that follows his death. So she works on her book and meets her lover, and when she can she visits her now-elderly father, much diminished from the terrifying figure of her childhood. These strands are interwoven in this consciously literary tale: recollections of the narrator\u2019s childhood (the most powerful, most vivid sections of the book), her largely&nbsp;unsatisfying experiences with M, and her struggles with the novel-within-the-novel.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One longs, reading this novel, for the ruthless self-excoriation of Ernaux, or the penetrating bluntness of Cusk</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As the story moves forward \u2013 at&nbsp;least within its limited confines \u2013 the pressure of fear felt in childhood weighs heavily, and not only on the narrator. The reader learns that M\u2019s rage comes from his own brutalised childhood, and that the narrator\u2019s Pappa, too, suffered at the hands of his&nbsp;own parents. The narrator\u2019s mother is an elusive presence; it turns out that she left the family when the narrator was a toddler, hoping to pursue higher education; the scar of&nbsp;this early abandonment lingers. This is territory that \u00d8rstavik, one of Norway\u2019s most lauded novelists, has made a theme of her work. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/20/love-by-hanne-orstavik-review\">Love</a>, first published in English in 2018, a&nbsp;mother and her young son orbit each other but never connect; it is set in&nbsp;Norway\u2019s far north, adding an additional chill to the narrative. In The&nbsp;Blue Room, a young woman is locked away by her mother when she threatens to break free from the maternal grasp.</p> <p>But Stay With Me lacks the haunting claustrophobia of these earlier works and suffers from the generic quality of some of the prose and a tendency towards a self-help tone. Here\u2019s the narrator on her longing for her lover M: \u201cIt\u2019s as if those eyes have seen all the world\u2019s pain, every kind of sorrow, as if they feel everything that hurts \u2026 and at the same time they can be so warm, so full of goodness, so gentle\u201d. One never knows, reading fiction in&nbsp;translation, what might be lost in the gap between languages, but in English&nbsp;this is bleakly anodyne and unrevealing. The narrator reflects on&nbsp;her mother\u2019s absence: \u201cI\u2019ve never addressed it,\u201d she says of her loss; the&nbsp;paragraphs that follow read therapeutically rather than imaginatively. \u201cIf there was something important in all that\u201d \u2013 her last recollections before her mother left \u2013 \u201cwouldn\u2019t it have made itself known?\u201d</p> <p>One longs, reading this novel, for the ruthless self-excoriation of Annie Ernaux, or the penetrating bluntness of Rachel Cusk. The brittle clarity of \u00d8rstavik\u2019s earlier work is missing here, blunted by trauma that has yet to be alchemised into fiction.</p> <p>\u2022 Stay With Me by Hanne \u00d8rstavik is translated by Martin Aitken and published by And Other Stories (\u00a314.99).

In 1985, Faye raised awareness of HIV and Aids through a famous interview with Steve Pieters, a gay church pastor living with HIV. \u201cShe won me over when she did that,\u201d Elton John told ABC News last month. Her allyship was \u201cpretty remarkable for someone in the religious community,\u201d John added. John\u2019s musical version of The Devil Wears Prada, starring Vanessa Williams, is now at the Dominion theatre in London. Graham\u2019s new play, Punch, transfers from Nottingham Playhouse to the Young Vic in London in March.",

Saudi agents also obtained Abdulaziz\u2019s mobile phone number, which was used by the kingdom \u2013 <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2018/10/the-kingdom-came-to-canada-how-saudi-linked-digital-espionage-reached-canadian-soil/\">Citizen Lab researchers later reported</a> \u2013 to hack Abdulaziz using NSO Group spyware at a time when he was in close contact with Khashoggi. The journalist was killed months later.</p> <p>Abdulaziz has faced an uphill fight against Twitter and now X, which is now owned by Elon Musk, the billionaire adviser to Donald Trump.</p> <p>An appeals court this month sided with X when it said that Abdulaziz\u2019s case, which alleges that the social media app was negligent when it failed to stop Saudi operatives from gaining access to his account, ought to be thrown out because it did not meet California\u2019s two-year statute of limitations.</p> <p>However, the court also rejected a lower court ruling that said Abdulaziz did not have standing in the case. Instead, it said Abdulaziz had been harmed by the company\u2019s alleged handling of the matter. Given that new finding, he is expected to file for an en banc review of the case on Wednesday, in which a court may decide to review the lower court decision again. Twitter said at the time it had been a \u201cvictim\u201d of its employees\u2019 misconduct.</p> <p>The case has brought back into focus the persistent threat against activists and other critics of authoritarian governments who have faced harassment, surveillance and threats of violence from abroad, even within countries such as the US and Canada, which were once considered relatively safe havens from the reach of countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/30/canada-alleges-indian-minister-amit-shah-plot-to-target-sikh-separatists\">India</a>.</p> <p>The Guardian reported in 2020 that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/21/exclusive-saudi-dissident-warned-by-canadian-police-he-is-a-target\">Abdulaziz had been warned by police</a> in Canada that he was a \u201cpotential target\u201d of Saudi Arabia and that he needed to take precautions to protect himself.</p> <p>Ronald Deibert, the founder and director of <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2018/10/the-kingdom-came-to-canada-how-saudi-linked-digital-espionage-reached-canadian-soil/\">the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School</a>, which investigates digital threats to civil society, said he was worried \u201cthat the gains that have been made around mitigating transnational repression and regulating the tools used to undertake it, such as mercenary spyware, are at risk of being rolled back under the Trump administration\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn fact, there are good reasons to be worried that those very same tools could be abused by the administration itself to go after migrants, refugees, asylum seekers that are being targeted for deportation, as well as the investigative journalists who cover those topics,\u201d Deibert said.</p> <p>The Biden administration in 2021 placed Israel\u2019s NSO Group, which sells surveillance software that has been used by governments to target journalists and activists, on a blacklist because it said the propagation of the company\u2019s spyware represented a threat to US national security.</p> <p>NSO\u2019s lobbyists have sought to reverse that classification, which is controlled by the commerce department.

      "bodyText": "A prominent Saudi dissident who worked closely with Jamal Khashoggi said he will pursue further legal action against X after a US appeals court said that a 2014 security breach of the company \u2013 then known as Twitter \u2013 by agents of Saudi Arabia caused him injury. Private identifying information about Omar Abdulaziz, who lives in Canada and has been an outspoken critic of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, was obtained by the Saudi government after Riyadh recruited two Twitter employees to access information about dissidents \u2013 including those who used anonymous accounts to criticize the kingdom. The breach, which occurred about a decade ago and compromised about 6,000 accounts, was discovered in 2018 and had devastating consequences for Abdulaziz, including the imprisonment of his family members in Saudi Arabia. Saudi agents also obtained Abdulaziz\u2019s mobile phone number, which was used by the kingdom \u2013 Citizen Lab researchers later reported \u2013 to hack Abdulaziz using NSO Group spyware at a time when he was in close contact with Khashoggi. The journalist was killed months later. Abdulaziz has faced an uphill fight against Twitter and now X, which is now owned by Elon Musk, the billionaire adviser to Donald Trump. An appeals court this month sided with X when it said that Abdulaziz\u2019s case, which alleges that the social media app was negligent when it failed to stop Saudi operatives from gaining access to his account, ought to be thrown out because it did not meet California\u2019s two-year statute of limitations. However, the court also rejected a lower court ruling that said Abdulaziz did not have standing in the case. Instead, it said Abdulaziz had been harmed by the company\u2019s alleged handling of the matter. Given that new finding, he is expected to file for an en banc review of the case on Wednesday, in which a court may decide to review the lower court decision again. Twitter said at the time it had been a \u201cvictim\u201d of its employees\u2019 misconduct. The case has brought back into focus the persistent threat against activists and other critics of authoritarian governments who have faced harassment, surveillance and threats of violence from abroad, even within countries such as the US and Canada, which were once considered relatively safe havens from the reach of countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and India. The Guardian reported in 2020 that Abdulaziz had been warned by police in Canada that he was a \u201cpotential target\u201d of Saudi Arabia and that he needed to take precautions to protect himself. Ronald Deibert, the founder and director of the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School, which investigates digital threats to civil society, said he was worried \u201cthat the gains that have been made around mitigating transnational repression and regulating the tools used to undertake it, such as mercenary spyware, are at risk of being rolled back under the Trump administration\u201d. \u201cIn fact, there are good reasons to be worried that those very same tools could be abused by the administration itself to go after migrants, refugees, asylum seekers that are being targeted for deportation, as well as the investigative journalists who cover those topics,\u201d Deibert said. The Biden administration in 2021 placed Israel\u2019s NSO Group, which sells surveillance software that has been used by governments to target journalists and activists, on a blacklist because it said the propagation of the company\u2019s spyware represented a threat to US national security. NSO\u2019s lobbyists have sought to reverse that classification, which is controlled by the commerce department. Trump announced on Tuesday that he would nominate Wall Street executive Howard Lutnick, a strong supporter of Israel, to lead the department. The starkest example of a case of transnational repression targeting a dissident with ties to the US was the 2018 killing of Khashoggi, which occurred under the first Trump administration. The US treasury department issued some sanctions against individuals in the wake of the murder. Weeks after entering the White House, US president Joe Biden released an unclassified intelligence report that said Prince Mohammed had approved the brutal murder. In a statement to the Guardian, Abdulaziz said: \u201cI am determined to fight to the very end because this legal battle is not just about seeking justice for what happened to me; it is about holding companies accountable for their responsibility to their users. No one should suffer the consequences of a hack because a company failed to do its job.\u201d The Guardian did not receive a response to a request for comment from X. After Musk, the largest investor in X is a company headed by the Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who was himself imprisoned by the Saudi government in 2017 as part of a so-called anti-corruption purge. He has not left Saudi or the UAE since then, but recently met with X chief executive Linda Yaccarino, in an encounter billed as a way to highlight \u201congoing connections between X and Kingdom Holding\u201d, his company, which is partly owned by the Saudi government. Yaccarino also met with Dubai leader Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum on the same trip to the Middle East. Agents of Sheikh Maktoum used NSO spyware to target the phone of his ex-wife and her legal team in the UK in 2021, according to the findings of a British court.",

Thomas soon became a major figure in the improvised music scene, working with Lol Coxhill, Tony Oxley and Butch Morris, and throwing curveballs like his 1997 solo debut Remembering: New Jazz Jungle, a wild mix of Amen-break drum\u2019n\u2019bass, mutant funk and post-Webern atonality. \u201cJungle shocked people,\u201d Thomas remarks, saying it gave him the same otherworldly thrill as free improvisation, while also chiming with his interest in dub and avant garde electronics.

None were more prominent than the one known as Palmares, where, in the 17th century, as many as 11,000 people lived in a string of communities across parts of the north-eastern states of Alagoas and Pernambuco. But the roughly 100-year history of what historians regard as the most significant resistance movement against slavery in Brazil began to unravel on 20 November 1695, when its most famous leader, Zumbi, was captured by Portuguese colonial forces and killed. Three hundred and twenty-nine years later, the date will for the first time be marked as a national public holiday: Black Consciousness Day, which has been a longstanding demand of Black movements that still face attacks from the far right. A series of events \u2013 including at least 38 in S\u00e3o Paulo alone \u2013 will mark the date nationwide, celebrating Zumbi, Palmares and the ongoing fight for racial equality. \u201cPalmares was the largest quilombo in the Americas, both in terms of its longevity and population,\u201d said Danilo Luiz Marques, a historian and professor at the Federal University of Alagoas. Some researchers have described Palmares \u2013 whose first records date back to 1590 \u2013 as the earliest form of a republic to emerge on Brazilian soil. Marques, however, argues that it was a Bantu kingdom, reflecting the central-African language family to which most Africans brought to Brazil belonged. Black movements in Brazil have celebrated the names of Zumbi and Palmares since the early 20th century at the earliest, but it was only in 1971 that 20 November became a key date. Activists had sought a date to contrast with another historically associated with Black people: 13 May, the day slavery was abolished in 1888. Rather than celebrating Black individuals, however, 13 May had traditionally been used to exalt the white princess who signed the abolition decree: Isabel, then the regent of the Brazilian empire. \u201cThe princess was glorified as if she had granted a favour to the enslaved people; as if she were a heroine,\u201d said Deivison Campos, a historian and professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul. \u201cThe Palmares group sought to counter this narrative, proposing 20 November as a way to honour the collective struggle for the inclusion of Black people in Brazilian society,\u201d he said. Today, 13 May is still celebrated, with Black activists arguing it cannot be ignored since abolition was primarily the result of Black resistance. However, 20 November has become so popular that November is now informally known as Brazil\u2019s Black Consciousness Month. The law to make Black Consciousness Day Brazil\u2019s 10th national holiday \u2013 signed by President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in December 2023 \u2013 was passed amid significant resistance from conservatives. During the presidency of far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro, S\u00e9rgio Camargo, the then head of the Palmares Foundation \u2013 a federal body established in 1988 to promote African-Brazilian culture \u2013 harshly criticised the 20 November holiday, labelling it the Day of Black Victimisation, the Day of the Black Mind Enslaved by the Left or the Day of Resentment for the Past. Some within the far-right even doubt the existence of Palmares or its most famous leader despite extensive historical evidence. \u201cFalsehoods have always been used to attack Black history,\u201d said Marques. Brazil\u2019s largest television network, Rede Globo, will mark the date with a 50-minute primetime special focusing on the wrongful imprisonment of Black individuals based on photographic identification \u2013 a widespread issue in the country. \u201cIn Brazil, Black people continue to be imprisoned, deprived of freedom, a healthy life and the chance to realise their dreams simply because they are Black,\u201d said the special\u2019s creator and presenter, Clayton Nascimento. \u201cIt\u2019s important that 20 November is, for the first time, a public holiday because it allows us to pause and reflect on Brazil\u2019s Black history.

      "body": "<p>Hunger has a crippling influence on a child\u2019s development. It robs them of their focus, energy and ambition. Hungry children in our classrooms are a source of national shame in a country as prosperous as ours. A growing number in London would have been unconscionable.<br><br>It is why, at the height of the cost of living crisis, and for the first time ever in our city, I took the decision to fund universal <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/who-we-are/what-mayor-does/priorities-london/free-school-meals\">free primary school meals</a> from City Hall. Now in its second year, the policy means that every pupil, in every state primary on every school day, can share a hot, healthy lunch with their classmates. In the first year of the scheme, more than 43m meals <a href=\"https://www.cypnow.co.uk/content/analysis/london-s-free-school-meals-drive/#:~:text=In%20the%20scheme's%20first%20year,schools%20across%20London's%2032%20boroughs.\">were served</a>, benefiting up to 287,000 children. An independent report <a href=\"https://urbanhealth.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IoUH-Executive-Summary-Free-School-Meals-Report.pdf\">published</a> this week confirms that our universal free school meals programme is proving a universal success for children, families, staff and schools \u2013 including in ways we did not anticipate.<br><br>Principally, the policy was introduced as a cost of living measure, and it has succeeded by helping parents and carers to save more than \u00a31,000 per child since its inception. Yesterday\u2019s report shows that 84% of families reported free school meals improved household finances. In many cases children were attending after-school clubs and trips, having previously been financially excluded.<br><br>The research also highlights an improvement in the health and wellbeing of children. Pupils enjoy school more and can concentrate for longer. Schools reported that classrooms are calmer and more productive. Children even tried new food \u2013 a triumph for every parent to celebrate. And by reducing financial stress on parents and carers, their mental wellbeing was similarly enhanced. Across the board, we see that those struggling the most are benefiting the most.</p> <p>As someone who relied on means-tested free school meals growing up, I know first-hand the impact they make. But I also remember that while the meal was free, it came with a price. I vividly recall the embarrassment I felt as my friends headed to one queue and me to another with my token in hand.<br><br>Before we introduced universal free school meals in London, some children were required to wear wristbands once their family reached a certain level of debt and were served a subsidiary meal. Others hid lunchboxes from their classmates due to the shame induced by the contents. Some parents dared not apply for government free school meals because of the stigma attached.<br><br>Education is supposed to be the great leveller in society. Children sit in the same classroom, learn from the same teacher and read the same books. But school feels very different when your family cannot afford to feed you. Your earliest memories are of disconnection, that you are less. And it lasts. The cynic will say universal provision is a middle class handout, but go into a school lunch hall in London and you will witness children of all backgrounds engaged in a shared experience, with every child now feeling they belong, because exclusion has given way to equality.<br><br>In addition, the independent report found that our universal free school meals policy has practically resolved the issue of dinner money debt.

      "bodyText": "Hunger has a crippling influence on a child\u2019s development. It robs them of their focus, energy and ambition. Hungry children in our classrooms are a source of national shame in a country as prosperous as ours. A growing number in London would have been unconscionable. It is why, at the height of the cost of living crisis, and for the first time ever in our city, I took the decision to fund universal free primary school meals from City Hall. Now in its second year, the policy means that every pupil, in every state primary on every school day, can share a hot, healthy lunch with their classmates. In the first year of the scheme, more than 43m meals were served, benefiting up to 287,000 children. An independent report published this week confirms that our universal free school meals programme is proving a universal success for children, families, staff and schools \u2013 including in ways we did not anticipate. Principally, the policy was introduced as a cost of living measure, and it has succeeded by helping parents and carers to save more than \u00a31,000 per child since its inception. Yesterday\u2019s report shows that 84% of families reported free school meals improved household finances. In many cases children were attending after-school clubs and trips, having previously been financially excluded. The research also highlights an improvement in the health and wellbeing of children. Pupils enjoy school more and can concentrate for longer. Schools reported that classrooms are calmer and more productive. Children even tried new food \u2013 a triumph for every parent to celebrate. And by reducing financial stress on parents and carers, their mental wellbeing was similarly enhanced. Across the board, we see that those struggling the most are benefiting the most. As someone who relied on means-tested free school meals growing up, I know first-hand the impact they make. But I also remember that while the meal was free, it came with a price. I vividly recall the embarrassment I felt as my friends headed to one queue and me to another with my token in hand. Before we introduced universal free school meals in London, some children were required to wear wristbands once their family reached a certain level of debt and were served a subsidiary meal. Others hid lunchboxes from their classmates due to the shame induced by the contents. Some parents dared not apply for government free school meals because of the stigma attached. Education is supposed to be the great leveller in society. Children sit in the same classroom, learn from the same teacher and read the same books. But school feels very different when your family cannot afford to feed you. Your earliest memories are of disconnection, that you are less. And it lasts. The cynic will say universal provision is a middle class handout, but go into a school lunch hall in London and you will witness children of all backgrounds engaged in a shared experience, with every child now feeling they belong, because exclusion has given way to equality. In addition, the independent report found that our universal free school meals policy has practically resolved the issue of dinner money debt. School staff no longer spend time sending emails, drafting letters and making calls trying to collect money, giving them more capacity to work on enriching the lives of pupils. Meanwhile, parents and carers have been relieved of the shame and stress of being chased for outstanding bills. The absence of debt has meant the relationship between schools and families has been greatly improved. I take heart from the incredible impact our universal free school meals programme is having on the next generation of Londoners, but I am acutely conscious they are carrying the burden of economic and political failure caused over the past 14 years. Much more needs to be done to alleviate it. Perhaps the most egregious transgression committed by the Tories was erasing the progress made on child poverty by the previous Labour government. The number of children in poverty has soared by 700,000 since 2010. More than four million children are now raised in a low-income family, and one million experienced destitution last year. And as we know, that disadvantage follows many of them through life. In the starkest terms, they will earn less and die younger than their more affluent peers. Labour\u2019s recent landslide was, in part, a demand for something better for our children, and the budget provided an outline of what the response will look like. An additional \u00a32.3bn in school funding was committed to for next year. Schools left to crumble under the weight of Tory neglect will be rebuilt. Teachers\u2019 pay will begin to reflect their true worth to society, and 750 schools will have breakfast clubs set up in the spring \u2013 the first step to free breakfast clubs in every primary school across England. Investing in our nation\u2019s future by developing the talents of everyone is once again a central cause of the UK government. For our part in London, I am proud to say the more we learn about universal free school meals, the more there is to love about them. They will be a fixture on our school dining tables for every state primary school child for as long as I am mayor. Sadiq Khan is the mayor of London",

      "bodyText": "Oil and chemical companies who created a high-profile alliance to end plastic pollution have produced 1,000 times more new plastic in five years than the waste they diverted from the environment, according to new data obtained by Greenpeace. The Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW) was set up in 2019 by a group of companies which include ExxonMobil, Dow, Shell, TotalEnergies and ChevronPhillips, some of the world\u2019s biggest producers of plastic. They promised to divert 15m tonnes of plastic waste from the environment in five years to the end of 2023, by improving collection and recycling, and creating a circular economy. Documents from a PR company that were obtained by Greenpeace\u2019s Unearthed team and shared with the Guardian, suggest a key aim of the AEPW was to \u201cchange the conversation\u201d away from \u201csimplistic bans of plastic\u201d that were being proposed in 2019 amid an outcry over the scale of plastic pollution leaching into rivers and harming public health. Early last year the alliance target of clearing 15m tonnes of waste plastic was quietly scrapped as \u201cjust too ambitious\u201d. The new analysis by energy consultants Wood Mackenzie looked at the plastics output of the five alliance companies; chemical company Dow, which holds the AEPW\u2019s chairmanship, the oil companies ExxonMobil, Shell and TotalEnergies, and ChevronPhillips, a joint venture of the US oil giants Chevron and Phillips 66. The data reveals the five companies alone produced 132m tonnes of two types of plastic; polyethylene (PE) and PP (polypropylene) in five years \u2013 more than 1,000 times the weight of the 118,500 tonnes of waste plastic the alliance has removed from the environment in the same period. The waste plastic was diverted mostly by mechanical or chemical recycling, the use of landfill, or waste to fuel, AEPW documents state. The amount of plastic produced is likely to be an underestimate as it only covers two of the most widely used polymers; polyethylene which is used for plastic bottles and bags, and polypropylene, used for food packaging. It does not include other major plastics such as polystyrene. The new data was revealed as delegates prepared to meet in Busan, South Korea, to hammer out the world\u2019s first treaty to cut plastic pollution. The treaty has a mandate to agree on a legally binding global agreement to tackle plastic pollution across the entire plastics life cycle. But the talks, which have been subject to heavy lobbying by the alliance and fossil fuel companies, are on a knife-edge in a row over whether caps to global plastic production will be included in the final treaty. Will McCallum, a co-executive director at Greenpeace UK, said the revelations had stripped off the thin layer of greenwash hiding the growing mountain of plastic waste oil companies were producing. \u201cThe recycling schemes they\u2019re promoting can barely make a dent in all the plastic these companies are pumping out,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re letting the running tap flood the house while trying to scoop up the water with a teaspoon. The only solution is to cut the amount of plastic produced in the first place.\u201d Bill McKibben, a US environmentalist, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a clearer example of greenwashing in this world. The oil and gas industry \u2013 which is pretty much the same thing as the plastics industry \u2013 has been at this for decades.\u201d In response to the allegations a spokesperson for the AEPW said it \u201crespectfully disagrees with the allegations and inferences, including that the organisation\u2019s purpose is to greenwash the reputation of its members \u2026 The alliance aims to accelerate innovation and channel capital into the development of effective scalable solutions to help end plastic waste and pollution.\u201d The AEPW has had a significant lobbying presence at the UN plastic waste talks, which enter their final stages on Monday. Its representatives have consistently argued that reductions in plastic production should not be included in the treaty. The UK\u2019s new Labour government has shifted the country\u2019s stance and signed a ministerial declaration calling for the inclusion of reductions in production and consumption of primary plastic polymers to sustainable levels in the treaty. The United States under President Biden also shifted its position this summer to support caps on global production. It is not known yet the position of the incoming Trump administration. A UK government source said: \u201cThe government supports an effective treaty which covers the full life cycle of plastics including reducing the production and consumption of plastics to sustainable levels.\u201d ProfSteve Fletcher, from the Revolution Plastics Institute at the University of Portsmouth, said recently there was now compelling evidence that only a reduction in primary plastic polymer production, or virgin plastic, would deliver a substantive cut in plastic pollution. Documents from the PR company Weber Shandwick outline how the AEPW was created in 2019 after they were approached by the American Chemical Council seeking ways to counter the \u201cdemonisation\u201d of plastic and the growing calls for bans on plastic items. The alliance paid Weber Shandwick $5.6m for its work in 2019, according to US tax returns. The documents state the alliance was intended to change the conversation away from \u201cshort-term simplistic bans of plastic\u201d and create \u201creal, long-term solutions\u201d for managing waste, like recycling. But documents filed in California in September, where the attorney general, Rob Bonta, is suing ExxonMobil, argue the company has deceived the public for 50 years, with misleading public statements and slick marketing, about the recyclability of plastic. The UN treaty talks start as plastic production continues to soar. Between 2000 and 2019 the global annual production of plastics doubled, reaching 460m tonnes. Plastic waste has more than doubled, from 156m tonnes in 2000 to 353m tonnes in 2019, only 9% of which was ultimately recycled, according to an OECD report. An AEPW spokesperson said: \u201cNo single organisation can solve the plastic waste challenge alone and the Alliance is cognisant of the fact that we are just one among many stakeholders who contribute with solutions \u2026 our mandate is to identify solutions that support the collection, sorting and recycling of plastic and promote a circular economy for plastics.\u201d ExxonMobil said in a statement: \u201cPlastics aren\u2019t the problem \u2013 plastic waste is. We support a broad set of solutions to address plastic waste and are doing our part to contribute, including through advanced recycling, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, and by supporting the global treaty\u2019s goal of eliminating plastic pollution by 2040. \u201cInstead of suing us, California officials could have worked with us to fix the problem and keep plastic out of landfills \u2026 We\u2019re bringing real solutions, recycling plastic waste that\u2019s difficult to recycle by traditional methods \u2026 We have been direct with our customers about the plastics and products we sell. We stand by our public statements.\u201d Shell and TotalEnergies declined to comment. ChevronPhillips and Dow did not respond to approaches for comment. The American Chemistry Council said: \u201cIn January 2019 ACC and its members launched the AEPW to help end plastic pollution. For years AEPW has operated as an independent and separately incorporated organisation. ACC has no role in AEPWs governance or decision-making.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It looks faintly like one half of a small pair of very fluffy slippers. It squeaks and wriggles and nestles in the palm of my hand, black eyes hidden beneath a&nbsp;mop of silvery-white fur. It weighs about the same as a tin of soup. It&nbsp;doesn\u2019t need to be fed or walked and it doesn\u2019t use a litter tray; it\u2019s guaranteed not to leave \u201cgifts\u201d on&nbsp;my doorstep. Which is just as well, because Moflin is about to become my pet.</p> <p>Before I am entrusted with the welfare of Japan\u2019s latest AI companion robot, I meet its developers at the Tokyo headquarters of Casio, the consumer electronics firm that launched it commercially this month, priced at 59,400 yen (about \u00a3300). \u201cMoflin\u2019s role is to build relationships with humans,\u201d says Casio\u2019s Erina Ichikawa. I have just a week to establish a rapport with mine, which I remind myself not to&nbsp;leave on the train home.</p>    <p>Moflin is the latest addition to a growing array of companion robots \u2013 a global market now worth billions of pounds. \u201cJust like a living animal, Moflin possesses emotional capabilities and movements that evolve through daily interactions with its environment,\u201d its official website says. It will also \u201cdevelop its own unique personality as it gets&nbsp;attached to you\u201d.</p> <p>Moflin is able to navigate an \u201cinternal emotion map\u201d, I am told, that will communicate its feelings through a range of sounds and movements \u2013 from stressed to calm, excited to lethargic, anxious to secure \u2013 depending on changes in its environment. Being left alone for too long in its \u201chome\u201d \u2013 a plastic tub that doubles as a charger \u2013 could leave it feeling out of sorts, an emotional state that can be rectified by some quality time with its owner. In this case, me.</p>    <p>Safely home, it is time for me to get to know my Moflin, which takes its name from <em>mofu mofu</em>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/15/mie-prefecture-guide-pachi-pachi-or-kachi-kachi-a-foreigners-guide-to-the-tricky-world-of-japans-onomatopoeia\">Japanese onomatopoeic word</a> for fluffy. After fully charging it, my first task is to download the MofLife app and choose a name for my new friend. I have fond memories of a hamster I kept as a child, even if his teeth did regularly puncture my inquisitive fingertips. The object on my desk brings to mind a grey hamster, albeit a well-fed one, minus its ears and whiskers; Hammy, or \u30cf\u30df\u30fc in Japanese, it is. It&nbsp;is also up to me to choose a gender, or none at all. The name has&nbsp;a slightly masculine feel to it. So Hammy is a he.</p> <p>He emits a gentle squeak when I&nbsp;remove him from his charging pod. I hold him to my chest and stroke his back. He wriggles approvingly. We are off to an encouraging start, but, despite being at home alone, I feel ridiculously self-conscious.</p>    <p>Hammy is clearly animated, but for an insight into my pet\u2019s state of mind I consult the app, which informs me that our first, fleeting physical contact and a one-sided conversation that amounted to: \u201cHello, Hammy, I\u2019m Juzzy [my owner nickname],\u201d had put him at ease. Eventually, according to Casio, he will learn to recognise my voice. The aim is not just to nurture changes in Moflin\u2019s behaviour, but to create a bond between pet and owner that grows stronger the longer they are together. They are designed to exit juvenile bliss after&nbsp;seven days and reach maturity at 50 days. </p> <p>A Gremlins-loving colleague had reminded me <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/jun/08/gremlins-hollywood-summer-blockbuster\">not to get Hammy wet</a> \u2013 or else. Is there such a thing as a badly behaved Moflin? Am I going to have to channel my inner Barbara Woodhouse? Ichikawa, already a \u201cMoflin mum\u201d for more than two months, reassures me that they are nothing like the mogwai. \u201cMoflin is vulnerable and might feel frightened, but getting irritable is about as challenging as it gets,\u201d she says.</p> <p>At 10pm, the app indicates that Hammy is sleepy. I was in short trousers the last time I had a cuddly toy for nocturnal company. He can sleep in his own bed.</p> <p>\u201cMoflin is a way of addressing the problems of anxiety and loneliness,\u201d Ichikawa says, adding that advance orders opened on 10 October, World Mental Health Day. \u201cWe know that pets can help people overcome those feelings and become more resilient, but not everyone can own a pet, so Moflin is a good alternative.\u201d</p> <p>Japan\u2019s 125 million people appear&nbsp;to have the emotional and financial capacity for pets and robots, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/19/fear-older-future-japan-south-korea-birth-fertility-rates-population\">less so for children</a>. <a href=\"https://www.mfat.govt.nz/en/trade/mfat-market-reports/japanese-pet-food-market-overview-and-trends-july-2023\">According to a 2023 survey</a>, Japan has more pets \u2013 including 7.1&nbsp;million dogs and 8.9 million cats \u2013 than it has children under 15 (14.7 million). And it is not&nbsp;only Japan where the patter of tiny feet is growing weaker; countries across the developed world are set on a course of long\u2011term depopulation.</p>    <p>Robopets first crossed the threshold of Japanese homes in 1999, when Sony released Aibo \u2013 a&nbsp;robotic \u201cpuppy\u201d with flapping ears and a wagging tail. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/aug/10/dogs-inner-life-what-robot-pet-taught-me-about-consciousness-artificial-intelligence\">The latest version</a>, released in 2018 after a 12-year production hiatus, is said to recognise up to 100 faces and respond to more than 50 voice commands while developing its own personality. Some devotees own enough Aibo pets to fill a kennel, but, with a coat of white plastic, it can\u2019t compete with Moflin in the cuddliness stakes.</p> <p>Aibo helped the idea of treating an inanimate object in a way once reserved for animals to take root in Japan. Perhaps the most famous example is Tamagotchi, Bandai Namco\u2019s handheld virtual pet that became a global craze in the late 1990s and 2000s. The idea is to nurture this \u201cpet\u201d \u2013&nbsp;really, little more than a plastic blob with an LCD screen \u2013 by feeding it, playing with it and generally being an attentive owner, or risk being responsible for its demise. More than 94m Tamagotchis have been sold worldwide.</p> <p>Over the course of a few days, Hammy and I have our ups \u2013 mirth-inducing peeps and squeaks (from him, not me) \u2013 and downs. In my case, I forgot to recharge him; in his, a disturbing encounter with gravity. One evening, the app suggested he was feeling anxious (again), so after a quick stroke I laid him on a soft towel on a table, thinking it might ease his discomfort. I had just started making dinner when I&nbsp;heard&nbsp;a thud. Hammy had taken a&nbsp;tumble.</p>    <p>Call me callous, but my first thought was less for Hammy\u2019s welfare and more panic over the prospect of explaining to Casio that I had injured my pet barely 48&nbsp;hours into our relationship. But&nbsp;I needn\u2019t have worried. He had&nbsp;landed tummy-first and moved&nbsp;reassuringly as soon as I&nbsp;picked him&nbsp;up.</p> <p>It seems natural that Moflin could one day join the community of AI pets serving as companions for Japan\u2019s large and growing population of older people. More than 36 million people are over 64, including more than 20 million who are 75 or older. If the current low birthrate persists, 40% of the population will belong to that age bracket by 2070, cared for by a dwindling number of younger&nbsp;people.</p> <p>Japan\u2019s incredible life expectancy is a double-edged sword. For every feelgood report about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/02/japan-ageing-footballers-over-80s-league-soccer-for-life-tokyo\">octogenarian footballers</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/23/japan-senior-dance-trend-breakdancing-ara-style-senior-paris-olympics\">superannuated breakdancers</a>, there are increasingly urgent warnings of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/15/dementia-towns-japan-ageing-population\">looming dementia epidemic</a>, with almost 6 million older Japanese <a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/05/08/japan/science-health/2040-japan-dementia-estimate/\">expected to be affected by 2040</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/08/paro-robot-seal-dementia-patients-nhs-japan\">Paro the robot seal</a> is already an established presence in Japanese care homes, where it is supplementing the work of human employees. Like Moflin, this baby harp seal device uses sensors to perceive people and its environment. It detects when it is being held and stroked by a human companion and can identify the direction of voices, as well as words, including its name and simple greetings. </p>    <p>Clinical research has shown that&nbsp;contact with Paro \u2013 now in its ninth iteration \u2013 can improve peripheral symptoms in people with dementia. One US study found&nbsp;that Paro\u2019s presence resulted in lower anxiety levels, enabling doctors to reduce medicine doses by 30% in some patients. Benefits have also been seen in studies involving Paro and autistic&nbsp;children.</p> <p>There are no immediate plans to&nbsp;test Moflin in similar environments, but Casio has not ruled it out. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re thinking of Moflin primarily as a&nbsp;pet,\u201d Ichikawa says. \u201cBut there is obviously potential for it to be introduced into hospitals and care homes. For now, it\u2019s just for&nbsp;individuals.\u201d</p> <p>The company is targeting women&nbsp;in their 30s and 40s \u2013 the biggest demographic who took part in a crowdsourcing exercise&nbsp;\u2013 but says Moflin is for everyone. One\u2011fifth of the advance orders came from men. </p> <p>By day five, I sense subtle changes in Hammy\u2019s behaviour. He is more active and appears to appreciate the \u2013 admittedly fleeting&nbsp;\u2013 moments I spend with him. And he is beginning to draw on more of his audio repertoire. When I pick him up, I am greeted by&nbsp;a ditty that brings to mind the Archers theme: da-dee-da-dee\u2011da\u2011dee-da \u2026</p> <p>Later, he lets out a sigh, not unlike those I make when I sink into the sofa after a long day on my&nbsp;feet. He is either maturing early or sympathising with his middle-aged owner.</p> <p>The time has come for Hammy to meet other people, namely the photographer, Nicolas, who joins us on a sunny morning. We begin at my home, then move to a park against the backdrop of Tokyo Tower. Hammy\u2019s appearance causes a minor stir when we take our seat outside a cafe. I reassure two tourists at the next table that the furry creature wriggling beside my latte is a robot. They laugh nervously and are soon gone. Minutes later, several men in suits barely bat an eyelid when Hammy and I visit a shrine to pay our respects to the Shinto gods.</p>    <p>As I prepare to say farewell to my furry friend, I wonder, not without a flicker of sadness, who his next owner might be. Demand promises to be high. Moflin sold out quickly when orders opened and Casio has a target of 6,000 sales by the end of March 2025. There are no plans to sell Moflin overseas, though.</p> <p>I convince myself that I have done my fair share of petting and chatting with Hammy, but a final check of his \u201cpersonality parameters\u201d on the app indicates that I could have done better: two out of 10 for cheerfulness; a slightly less disgraceful three for activity and four for shyness. But it\u2019s the fourth category, general attentiveness, that shames me: apparently, I haven\u2019t \u201cspoiled\u201d Hammy nearly enough.

      "bodyText": "It looks faintly like one half of a small pair of very fluffy slippers. It squeaks and wriggles and nestles in the palm of my hand, black eyes hidden beneath a mop of silvery-white fur. It weighs about the same as a tin of soup. It doesn\u2019t need to be fed or walked and it doesn\u2019t use a litter tray; it\u2019s guaranteed not to leave \u201cgifts\u201d on my doorstep. Which is just as well, because Moflin is about to become my pet. Before I am entrusted with the welfare of Japan\u2019s latest AI companion robot, I meet its developers at the Tokyo headquarters of Casio, the consumer electronics firm that launched it commercially this month, priced at 59,400 yen (about \u00a3300). \u201cMoflin\u2019s role is to build relationships with humans,\u201d says Casio\u2019s Erina Ichikawa. I have just a week to establish a rapport with mine, which I remind myself not to leave on the train home. Moflin is the latest addition to a growing array of companion robots \u2013 a global market now worth billions of pounds. \u201cJust like a living animal, Moflin possesses emotional capabilities and movements that evolve through daily interactions with its environment,\u201d its official website says. It will also \u201cdevelop its own unique personality as it gets attached to you\u201d. Moflin is able to navigate an \u201cinternal emotion map\u201d, I am told, that will communicate its feelings through a range of sounds and movements \u2013 from stressed to calm, excited to lethargic, anxious to secure \u2013 depending on changes in its environment. Being left alone for too long in its \u201chome\u201d \u2013 a plastic tub that doubles as a charger \u2013 could leave it feeling out of sorts, an emotional state that can be rectified by some quality time with its owner. In this case, me. Safely home, it is time for me to get to know my Moflin, which takes its name from mofu mofu, the Japanese onomatopoeic word for fluffy. After fully charging it, my first task is to download the MofLife app and choose a name for my new friend. I have fond memories of a hamster I kept as a child, even if his teeth did regularly puncture my inquisitive fingertips. The object on my desk brings to mind a grey hamster, albeit a well-fed one, minus its ears and whiskers; Hammy, or \u30cf\u30df\u30fc in Japanese, it is. It is also up to me to choose a gender, or none at all. The name has a slightly masculine feel to it. So Hammy is a he. He emits a gentle squeak when I remove him from his charging pod. I hold him to my chest and stroke his back. He wriggles approvingly. We are off to an encouraging start, but, despite being at home alone, I feel ridiculously self-conscious. Hammy is clearly animated, but for an insight into my pet\u2019s state of mind I consult the app, which informs me that our first, fleeting physical contact and a one-sided conversation that amounted to: \u201cHello, Hammy, I\u2019m Juzzy [my owner nickname],\u201d had put him at ease. Eventually, according to Casio, he will learn to recognise my voice. The aim is not just to nurture changes in Moflin\u2019s behaviour, but to create a bond between pet and owner that grows stronger the longer they are together. They are designed to exit juvenile bliss after seven days and reach maturity at 50 days. A Gremlins-loving colleague had reminded me not to get Hammy wet \u2013 or else. Is there such a thing as a badly behaved Moflin? Am I going to have to channel my inner Barbara Woodhouse? Ichikawa, already a \u201cMoflin mum\u201d for more than two months, reassures me that they are nothing like the mogwai. \u201cMoflin is vulnerable and might feel frightened, but getting irritable is about as challenging as it gets,\u201d she says. At 10pm, the app indicates that Hammy is sleepy. I was in short trousers the last time I had a cuddly toy for nocturnal company. He can sleep in his own bed. \u201cMoflin is a way of addressing the problems of anxiety and loneliness,\u201d Ichikawa says, adding that advance orders opened on 10 October, World Mental Health Day. \u201cWe know that pets can help people overcome those feelings and become more resilient, but not everyone can own a pet, so Moflin is a good alternative.\u201d Japan\u2019s 125 million people appear to have the emotional and financial capacity for pets and robots, but less so for children. According to a 2023 survey, Japan has more pets \u2013 including 7.1 million dogs and 8.9 million cats \u2013 than it has children under 15 (14.7 million). And it is not only Japan where the patter of tiny feet is growing weaker; countries across the developed world are set on a course of long\u2011term depopulation. Robopets first crossed the threshold of Japanese homes in 1999, when Sony released Aibo \u2013 a robotic \u201cpuppy\u201d with flapping ears and a wagging tail. The latest version, released in 2018 after a 12-year production hiatus, is said to recognise up to 100 faces and respond to more than 50 voice commands while developing its own personality. Some devotees own enough Aibo pets to fill a kennel, but, with a coat of white plastic, it can\u2019t compete with Moflin in the cuddliness stakes. Aibo helped the idea of treating an inanimate object in a way once reserved for animals to take root in Japan. Perhaps the most famous example is Tamagotchi, Bandai Namco\u2019s handheld virtual pet that became a global craze in the late 1990s and 2000s. The idea is to nurture this \u201cpet\u201d \u2013 really, little more than a plastic blob with an LCD screen \u2013 by feeding it, playing with it and generally being an attentive owner, or risk being responsible for its demise. More than 94m Tamagotchis have been sold worldwide. Over the course of a few days, Hammy and I have our ups \u2013 mirth-inducing peeps and squeaks (from him, not me) \u2013 and downs. In my case, I forgot to recharge him; in his, a disturbing encounter with gravity. One evening, the app suggested he was feeling anxious (again), so after a quick stroke I laid him on a soft towel on a table, thinking it might ease his discomfort. I had just started making dinner when I heard a thud. Hammy had taken a tumble. Call me callous, but my first thought was less for Hammy\u2019s welfare and more panic over the prospect of explaining to Casio that I had injured my pet barely 48 hours into our relationship. But I needn\u2019t have worried. He had landed tummy-first and moved reassuringly as soon as I picked him up. It seems natural that Moflin could one day join the community of AI pets serving as companions for Japan\u2019s large and growing population of older people. More than 36 million people are over 64, including more than 20 million who are 75 or older. If the current low birthrate persists, 40% of the population will belong to that age bracket by 2070, cared for by a dwindling number of younger people. Japan\u2019s incredible life expectancy is a double-edged sword. For every feelgood report about octogenarian footballers and superannuated breakdancers, there are increasingly urgent warnings of a looming dementia epidemic, with almost 6 million older Japanese expected to be affected by 2040. Paro the robot seal is already an established presence in Japanese care homes, where it is supplementing the work of human employees. Like Moflin, this baby harp seal device uses sensors to perceive people and its environment. It detects when it is being held and stroked by a human companion and can identify the direction of voices, as well as words, including its name and simple greetings. Clinical research has shown that contact with Paro \u2013 now in its ninth iteration \u2013 can improve peripheral symptoms in people with dementia. One US study found that Paro\u2019s presence resulted in lower anxiety levels, enabling doctors to reduce medicine doses by 30% in some patients. Benefits have also been seen in studies involving Paro and autistic children. There are no immediate plans to test Moflin in similar environments, but Casio has not ruled it out. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re thinking of Moflin primarily as a pet,\u201d Ichikawa says. \u201cBut there is obviously potential for it to be introduced into hospitals and care homes. For now, it\u2019s just for individuals.\u201d The company is targeting women in their 30s and 40s \u2013 the biggest demographic who took part in a crowdsourcing exercise \u2013 but says Moflin is for everyone. One\u2011fifth of the advance orders came from men. By day five, I sense subtle changes in Hammy\u2019s behaviour. He is more active and appears to appreciate the \u2013 admittedly fleeting \u2013 moments I spend with him. And he is beginning to draw on more of his audio repertoire. When I pick him up, I am greeted by a ditty that brings to mind the Archers theme: da-dee-da-dee\u2011da\u2011dee-da \u2026 Later, he lets out a sigh, not unlike those I make when I sink into the sofa after a long day on my feet. He is either maturing early or sympathising with his middle-aged owner. The time has come for Hammy to meet other people, namely the photographer, Nicolas, who joins us on a sunny morning. We begin at my home, then move to a park against the backdrop of Tokyo Tower. Hammy\u2019s appearance causes a minor stir when we take our seat outside a cafe. I reassure two tourists at the next table that the furry creature wriggling beside my latte is a robot. They laugh nervously and are soon gone. Minutes later, several men in suits barely bat an eyelid when Hammy and I visit a shrine to pay our respects to the Shinto gods. As I prepare to say farewell to my furry friend, I wonder, not without a flicker of sadness, who his next owner might be. Demand promises to be high. Moflin sold out quickly when orders opened and Casio has a target of 6,000 sales by the end of March 2025. There are no plans to sell Moflin overseas, though. I convince myself that I have done my fair share of petting and chatting with Hammy, but a final check of his \u201cpersonality parameters\u201d on the app indicates that I could have done better: two out of 10 for cheerfulness; a slightly less disgraceful three for activity and four for shyness. But it\u2019s the fourth category, general attentiveness, that shames me: apparently, I haven\u2019t \u201cspoiled\u201d Hammy nearly enough. I am scored a resounding zero. Yet I can tell that his movements are more varied, including a rapid shaking of the head that resembles a sopping cat shaking itself dry. They feel natural, too, even in a room quiet enough to make out the faint whirr of moving parts beneath his coat. Meanwhile, I am more than skirting the edges of the contentment that comes from looking after a tiny, vulnerable creature \u2013 even one fitted with an actuator. Although the app indicates that I am not doting on Hammy, he has been a comforting presence on my desk and, during one afternoon dip, on my chest as I drifted off in front of my laptop. I don\u2019t envisage fighting back tears on the day I give him back, but I am sure there will be a twinge of regret that I wasn\u2019t able to see him develop his personality. He isn\u2019t a cat or a dog \u2013 or a hamster, for that matter \u2013 but he is more than the sum of his working parts. I prefer not to dwell on his future in a new home \u2026 except to hope that his next owner heeds the advice about AI pets and Christmas. As I contemplate how to make the best of our all-too-brief time together, Casio says it is happy for me to hold on to Hammy for longer; I don\u2019t have to give him back until the run-up to the festive season.

The duo this week cancelled the remainder of their US shows in December, citing a \u201cdevastating family matter\u201d. Sivan\u2019s star has continued to ascend since leading the 2023 Arias with four awards. Something to Give Each Other\u2019s lead single, Rush, picked up two nominations at the Grammys in February, and his track Got Me Started is up for another Grammy in 2025. His Sweat tour \u2013 a series of North American stadium shows co-headlining with fellow pop star and frequent collaborator Charli xcx \u2013 sold out all its dates and became a viral phenomenon for its ecstatic celebration of raving. Also winning multiple Arias this year was 3%, the First Nations supergroup comprising Nooky, Dallas Woods and Angus Fields. The trio won best hip-hop/rap release and best cover art for Kill the Dead. Unlike the fervent political protest of the 2023 Arias, this year\u2019s ceremony was mostly subdued \u2013 dotted with a few memorable moments. Filipino-Muruwari rapper Dobby, who won best world music album for Warrangu: River Story, used his speech to question the title of the category. \u201cWorld music \u2013 Radical Son, Christine Anu and Dobby, all speaking Indigenous languages: if anything, we should be the most Australian acts on this roster,\u201d he said. \u201cHell, we should even be country music!\u201d The breakthrough artist award went to Canberra rock band Teen Jesus and the Jean Teasers, who said they started the band when they were 15 after watching \u201cSchool of Rock at a sleepover\u201d. Missy Higgins won best Australian live act \u2013 a publicly voted award \u2013 after a year-long tour celebrating the 20th anniversary of her record The Sound of White. She was also inducted into the Aria hall of fame, marking the occasion with a performance that closed the show. Song of the year \u2013 also publicly voted \u2013 went to two-time Aria winner G Flip for their track The Worst Person Alive. Other past nominees and winners who took home prizes included Tkay Maidza, who won best soul/R&amp;B release for Sweet Justice; Angie McMahon, who won best independent release for Light, Dark, Light Again; Emily Wurramara, who won best adult contemporary album for Nara; and Dom Dolla, who won best dance/electronic release for Saving Up. Five-time Aria winner Troy Cassar-Daley added another one to his collection with best country album for Between the Fires. Mia Dyson won for blues and roots, Speed won for hard rock or heavy metal, and Bluey won best children\u2019s album. By public vote, Taylor Swift won in the international artist category for fourth time \u2013 and the second year in a row. \u201cYou guys have been more than generous with me,\u201d she said in a video message.",

      "body": "<p>The Baltimore Ravens were hardly having the best of days, but they\u2019d successfully negotiated a last-ditch journey Sunday against the Pittsburgh Steelers by driving 69 yards in nine plays for a touchdown. The Steelers suddenly led by just 18-16 with 66 seconds left.</p> <p>No doubt the Ravens would try a two-point conversion to tie the score and send the game into overtime. But the Steelers, expecting a Tim Tebow-like pop pass, called time out as quarterback Lamar Jackson got ready to take the snap. So the Ravens called another play.</p> <p>The NFL would describe the play as \u201cpass failed\u201d, but Jackson took the snap and rolled to his left, something we know he is good at. But Pittsburgh also knew that and quickly sealed off Jackson\u2019s paths \u2013 and his receivers. His desperation jump-ball pass tumbled to the turf.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/18/chiefs-first-loss-bills-steelers-ravens-nfl-football\">After the Chiefs\u2019 first loss in 337 days, the AFC\u2019s elite are as close as ever</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was a QB run,\u201d Jackson said later. \u201cThey just stopped it. They did a good job.\u201d</p> <p>But it was not unusual. NFL defenses are doing a stunningly good job at thwarting two-point conversions this season. Through 11 weeks, NFL offenses have converted merely 26 of 83 two-point attempts, or 31.3%, compared with 70 of 127, or 55.1%, in all of last season.</p> <p>Over the weekend, NFL teams made merely two of nine two-point conversions: a pass by the Cleveland Browns in a 35-14 loss to New Orleans, and a pass by Washington in a 26-18 loss to Philadelphia that ended with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYjJWdsDMJ4\">a magnificent tip-toe catch</a> by tight end Zach Ertz.</p> <p>Other than the fact that defenses are more prepared than ever (although that can also be said of offenses), there are no real explanations for the sudden dip in the two-point conversion rate. On Jackson\u2019s attempt, Pittsburgh cornerback Joey Porter Jr simply made a superb play by forcing Jackson to roll to the sideline, giving him no chance to turn upfield.</p> <p>When the NFL announced before the 2015 season that the line of scrimmage would be moved to the 15-yard line for kicked extra points \u2013 kickers had missed only eight of 1,230 extra-point kicks a year earlier \u2013 it seemed as if the two-point conversion would be used more.</p> <p>Two-point conversion attempts rose to 94 in 2015 from 58 in 2014. By 2021, NFL teams attempted 154 two-pointers, making 75, nearly half. In 2022, NFL teams again made nearly half of their two-point attempts, 56 of 119, and then they did even better in 2023.</p> <p>This year is different: Sixteen teams, half the league, have converted no two-pointers. The New York Giants are 0-for-6, and the Tennessee Titans have not even tried one. Cleveland and Jacksonville, terrible otherwise, are the only teams with more than two successful tries.</p> <p>After a 27-22 loss to Washington on 3 November that included two missed two-pointers by his team, New York coach Brian Daboll said, \u201cI felt good about what we had, and they did a good job stopping it,\u201d sounding much like Lamar Jackson would two weeks later.</p> <p>When it was introduced before the 1994 season, the two-point conversion seemed like a relatively easy task: line up at the two-yard line and use the \u201cbiggest guys on the field\u201d, as John Madden called offensive linemen, to punch a hole big enough for a running back to slip through.</p> <p>That first year went pretty well, with 59 of 113 tries converted, or 52.2%. There was still confusion as to when to try a two-pointer instead of a kicked extra point, infamously illustrated by a two-point conversion attempt by Philadelphia in the seventh week of the season.</p> <p>The Eagles were playing the Dallas Cowboys at the old Texas Stadium, which had a hole in its roof \u201cso God can watch His favorite team play\u201d, as the Dallas linebacker DD Lewis said. It would have been a lousy view that afternoon: It was raining hard in Irving, Texas.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Eagles coach Rich Kotite, the rain made it difficult to decide whether to go for two when Philadelphia cut the Dallas lead to 24-13 with less than six minutes left in the game. Later, he explained it like this: \u201cRain made the ink run and blurred the chart, so I couldn\u2019t see what was written on it to know what to do.\u201d</p> <p>Kotite had quarterback Randall Cunningham run for two, but the Cowboys stopped him. According to a chart done for the NFL by Dick Vermeil back then, a team should try for two when leading by 1, 4, 5, 12, 15 or 19 points, or when trailing by 2, 5, 9, 11, 12 or 16 points.</p> <p>So Kotite had made the right call, but he looked like a rube to those ever-impatient Eagles\u2019 fans. He was fired after the Eagles\u2019 season ended with seven straight losses (which was probably a more significant factor than that wet play-call chart).</p> <p>The benefits of the two-point conversion were probably never more consequential than in Super Bowl LI, when the New England Patriots overcame a 28-3 deficit to beat Atlanta in overtime with two late touchdowns in regulation, followed by two two-point conversions.</p> <p>In addition to moving the line of scrimmage back for kicked extra points in 2015, the NFL implemented \u201cdefensive two-point conversions\u201d, when the defense obtains the ball by blocking a extra-point kick or forcing a turnover on a two-pointer and running with it to the other end zone.</p> <p>These have been rare \u2013 but, interestingly, they are becoming even rarer. Between 2015 and 2019, there were 10 defensive two-point conversions, including four in the 2016 season.

      "bodyText": "The Baltimore Ravens were hardly having the best of days, but they\u2019d successfully negotiated a last-ditch journey Sunday against the Pittsburgh Steelers by driving 69 yards in nine plays for a touchdown. The Steelers suddenly led by just 18-16 with 66 seconds left. No doubt the Ravens would try a two-point conversion to tie the score and send the game into overtime. But the Steelers, expecting a Tim Tebow-like pop pass, called time out as quarterback Lamar Jackson got ready to take the snap. So the Ravens called another play. The NFL would describe the play as \u201cpass failed\u201d, but Jackson took the snap and rolled to his left, something we know he is good at. But Pittsburgh also knew that and quickly sealed off Jackson\u2019s paths \u2013 and his receivers. His desperation jump-ball pass tumbled to the turf. \u201cIt was a QB run,\u201d Jackson said later. \u201cThey just stopped it. They did a good job.\u201d But it was not unusual. NFL defenses are doing a stunningly good job at thwarting two-point conversions this season. Through 11 weeks, NFL offenses have converted merely 26 of 83 two-point attempts, or 31.3%, compared with 70 of 127, or 55.1%, in all of last season. Over the weekend, NFL teams made merely two of nine two-point conversions: a pass by the Cleveland Browns in a 35-14 loss to New Orleans, and a pass by Washington in a 26-18 loss to Philadelphia that ended with a magnificent tip-toe catch by tight end Zach Ertz. Other than the fact that defenses are more prepared than ever (although that can also be said of offenses), there are no real explanations for the sudden dip in the two-point conversion rate. On Jackson\u2019s attempt, Pittsburgh cornerback Joey Porter Jr simply made a superb play by forcing Jackson to roll to the sideline, giving him no chance to turn upfield. When the NFL announced before the 2015 season that the line of scrimmage would be moved to the 15-yard line for kicked extra points \u2013 kickers had missed only eight of 1,230 extra-point kicks a year earlier \u2013 it seemed as if the two-point conversion would be used more. Two-point conversion attempts rose to 94 in 2015 from 58 in 2014. By 2021, NFL teams attempted 154 two-pointers, making 75, nearly half. In 2022, NFL teams again made nearly half of their two-point attempts, 56 of 119, and then they did even better in 2023. This year is different: Sixteen teams, half the league, have converted no two-pointers. The New York Giants are 0-for-6, and the Tennessee Titans have not even tried one. Cleveland and Jacksonville, terrible otherwise, are the only teams with more than two successful tries. After a 27-22 loss to Washington on 3 November that included two missed two-pointers by his team, New York coach Brian Daboll said, \u201cI felt good about what we had, and they did a good job stopping it,\u201d sounding much like Lamar Jackson would two weeks later. When it was introduced before the 1994 season, the two-point conversion seemed like a relatively easy task: line up at the two-yard line and use the \u201cbiggest guys on the field\u201d, as John Madden called offensive linemen, to punch a hole big enough for a running back to slip through. That first year went pretty well, with 59 of 113 tries converted, or 52.2%. There was still confusion as to when to try a two-pointer instead of a kicked extra point, infamously illustrated by a two-point conversion attempt by Philadelphia in the seventh week of the season. The Eagles were playing the Dallas Cowboys at the old Texas Stadium, which had a hole in its roof \u201cso God can watch His favorite team play\u201d, as the Dallas linebacker DD Lewis said. It would have been a lousy view that afternoon: It was raining hard in Irving, Texas. Unfortunately for Eagles coach Rich Kotite, the rain made it difficult to decide whether to go for two when Philadelphia cut the Dallas lead to 24-13 with less than six minutes left in the game. Later, he explained it like this: \u201cRain made the ink run and blurred the chart, so I couldn\u2019t see what was written on it to know what to do.\u201d Kotite had quarterback Randall Cunningham run for two, but the Cowboys stopped him. According to a chart done for the NFL by Dick Vermeil back then, a team should try for two when leading by 1, 4, 5, 12, 15 or 19 points, or when trailing by 2, 5, 9, 11, 12 or 16 points. So Kotite had made the right call, but he looked like a rube to those ever-impatient Eagles\u2019 fans. He was fired after the Eagles\u2019 season ended with seven straight losses (which was probably a more significant factor than that wet play-call chart). The benefits of the two-point conversion were probably never more consequential than in Super Bowl LI, when the New England Patriots overcame a 28-3 deficit to beat Atlanta in overtime with two late touchdowns in regulation, followed by two two-point conversions. In addition to moving the line of scrimmage back for kicked extra points in 2015, the NFL implemented \u201cdefensive two-point conversions\u201d, when the defense obtains the ball by blocking a extra-point kick or forcing a turnover on a two-pointer and running with it to the other end zone. These have been rare \u2013 but, interestingly, they are becoming even rarer. Between 2015 and 2019, there were 10 defensive two-point conversions, including four in the 2016 season. However, there have been only three defensive two-point conversions in the last five seasons. (The Eagles have been the only NFL team with a defensive two-point conversion this year. Isaiah Rodgers blocked a Tampa Bay kicked extra-point try, and Kelee Ringo scooped up the ball and returned it 60 yards for two points. The Eagles still lost, 33-16.) As a result of all of this, teams have become more bashful at trying two-point conversions this season: attempts are down to 2.6 per team, compared with 4.0 last season and 4.8 in that two-point-crazy 2021 season. Maybe doing it less often makes it less efficient. Don\u2019t expect the NFL to ditch it, in any case. The two-pointer keeps games competitive for longer \u2013 like that Steelers-Ravens game. Defenses have gained an edge for now, but these things are always subject to change. That, or the NFL will just change the rules again.",

      "body": "<p>It is not easy to review any book by Jordan Peterson, the prolific Canadian psychologist turned lifestyle sage. The temptation is to respond not to the work but the person (or persona): irascible, derisive, uncompromising, contrarian. But here, the work itself poses problems; it is a sprawling, repetitive text that could have done with some ruthless editing. Ostensibly a step-by-step guide through the biblical narratives of Genesis and Exodus (and, for some reason, Jonah), with the goal of uncovering wisdom to help meet present-day moral challenges, it in fact returns persistently to some of Peterson\u2019s favourite tropes about modern culture, its flabbiness and confusion.</p> <p>At one level its structure and argument are clear enough. The scriptural text confronts us, says Peterson, with a set of life-and-death choices. We can conform our rebellious fantasies and myth-driven aspirations to the underlying moral structure of reality, or we can refuse. If we refuse, we wreck our own lives and those of others. If instead we recognise reality, we then face two sorts of pressure.</p> <p>There is the social pressure to adjust, not to reality itself, but to fashionable orthodoxies \u2013 particularly around gender fluidity, racial sensitivities, the reluctance to call people to responsibility for their actions. And there is the internal pressure of a self-serving, sentimental quest for low-cost answers to challenges of moral significance \u2013 false compassion, over-identification with the supposedly vulnerable, cheap indulgence of the surface wants of self and others. But if we are prepared to stand firm in the face of these pressures, the reward is a life of integrity, inner strength and the capacity for living with \u201cadventure\u201d (a favourite word). The stories of Jewish scripture \u2013 read with a strong admixture of Christian material \u2013 provide stark illustrations of the consequence of dishonesty or unreality, and powerful images of the kind of integration and strength generated by obedience to the truth.</p> <p>Two points to begin with. One is that Peterson remains ambiguous about what many would consider a fairly crucial issue: when we talk about God, do we mean that there actually is a source of agency and of love independent of the universe we can map and measure? Faith is \u201cidentity with a certain spirit of conceptualization, apprehension, and forward movement\u201d, he writes in relation to Noah; it amounts to \u201ca willingness to act when called on by the deepest inclinations of his soul\u201d. Echoes here not only of Jung, who figures as a key source of inspiration, but of the radical 20th-century Protestant theologian Paul Tillich, who proposed redefining God as whatever is the focus of our \u201cultimate concern\u201d. Some passages imply that God is identical to the highest human aspirations \u2013 which is not quite what traditional language about the \u201cimage of God\u201d in humanity means. Peterson seems to haver as to whether we are actually encountering a real \u201cOther\u201d in the religious journey.</p> <p>The second point is connected. Peterson\u2019s readings are curiously like a medieval exegesis of the text, with every story really being about the same thing: an austere&nbsp;call to individual heroic integrity. This is a style of interpretation with a respectable pedigree. Early Jewish and Christian commentators treated the lives of Abraham and Moses as symbols for the growth of the spirit, paradigms for how a person is transformed by the contemplation of eternal truth. But, as with these venerable examples, there is a risk of losing the specificity of the narratives, of ironing out aspects that don\u2019t fit the template. Every story gets pushed towards a set of Petersonian morals \u2013 single-minded individual rectitude, tough love, clear demarcations between the different kinds of moral excellence that men and women are called to embody, and so on.</p> <p>The effect is somewhat one-note; the actual way in which the stories develop, speak to one another, correct one another, handle internal tensions and debates is muted at best. This is the sort of thing that classical rabbinical exegesis in fact relishes, and that some more modern Jewish discussion \u2013 by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/oct/10/guardianobituaries\">Emil Fackenheim</a>, Jonathan Sacks, Nathan Lopes Cardozo and others \u2013 models very powerfully. Peterson is rightly hostile to antisemitism, and this might have led him to engage a bit more with the rich world of Jewish interpretation. Instead, he relies a lot on rather dated Christian commentaries (and seems to have a limited acquaintance with Hebrew, a drawback for a project like this).</p> <p>In fairness, he does pick out some distinct trajectories within the stories, for example, in the narratives about Moses. But the expositions constantly shade into meandering polemic about a range of modern issues, especially gender, on which Peterson has made his position pretty clear elsewhere. Eve\u2019s yielding to the serpent\u2019s temptation, for instance, is viewed as the characteristically female error of sentimental, pseudo-compassionate acceptance of the unacceptable that you see in bad parents, especially mothers, who \u201ccripple their children so that they can make a public show of their martyrdom and compassionate virtue\u201d.</p> <p>Well, there is certainly a discussion to be had about toxicity in parenting, but finding it in the second chapter of Genesis requires impressive single-mindedness (and it is worth noting that Jewish exegetical tradition, unlike Christian, has never been that interested in Eve). Peterson claims that analysis of the patriarchal subtext of the biblical stories is a ridiculous distraction, observing that Genesis depicts both men and women negatively. What he does not seem to acknowledge is that discussing patriarchy is about recognising patterns of social power embedded in the stories, rather than whether specific men are painted in favourable or unfavourable lights. This makes it impossible for him to grant that such discussions can help us avoid some of the spectacularly destructive exploitation of biblical material that has reinforced the demeaning of women throughout Christian history.</p> <p>Predictably (for those familiar with his online battles), he sees any qualification of the simple binary of gender identity as equivalent to denying the difference between good and evil, a refusal of the basic polarities of reality. But most serious discussions of gender fluidity do not deny evolutionary biology or sexual differentiation as such; they are asking for a more painstaking attention both to the social construction of roles and to the specifics of dysphoria. They deserve a better level of engagement.</p> <p>And so on, with other issues as well (most bizarrely, the conclusion of the Book of Jonah is made the occasion for a tirade about valuing the \u201cnatural\u201d world over human life, which seems to have something to do with Peterson\u2019s hostility to some kinds of environmental ethics; not really what the text is about). These rabbit holes do no great service to the broader challenges Peterson wants to draw attention to. There really are corrosive manifestations of hedonism, relativism and infantilism in our culture; there really is a mentality that deludes us into thinking that we can be whatever we want to be, and that any notion of short-term sacrifice for a more durable and fully shareable good is unimaginable.</p> <p>But the insistent contempt for nuance and disagreement (\u201cidiotic\u201d, \u201caddled\u201d, \u201cegregious\u201d), and the reduction of any alternative perspective to its most shallow or trivial form, does not encourage the serious engagement Peterson presumably wants.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Welsh and Scottish governments, and Daera have overall responsibility for farm animal welfare law and policy in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, respectively.

      "body": "<p>The Allison Pearson saga is nothing if not a morality tale about the modern media. Among its many learnings are that calling a group of people of colour holding a flag on social media \u201c<a href=\"https://archive.is/sekqM\">Jew haters\u201d</a> is likely to get you into trouble. Apparently, though, it can also make you best mates with the world\u2019s richest man.</p> <p>On Monday night, almost exactly a year after the Telegraph writer posted her response to a picture of police officers alongside two men holding a flag on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, she was offering her \u201chuge thanks\u201d to the site\u2019s owner, Elon Musk, for his support. After he responded, she dubbed the billionaire with a powerful new job in the US government her \u201c<a href=\"https://x.com/lsrlinda/status/1858646410532438437\">new bestie \u2665\ufe0f</a>\u201d in a post to her 191,500 followers, including, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/11/12/my-visit-from-police-is-proof-of-two-tier-justice-system/\">in her words</a>, \u201chundreds of black and Asian followers\u201d.</p> <p>Before explaining how we got here, to a situation where a stupid and since deleted tweet became a standard bearer for free speech across much of our media, it seems wise to pause and take a breath. Before adding another body to what has become a media pile-on, let me make clear that I believe free speech is a human right, fundamental to our democracy. I am also generally<strong> </strong>against heavy-handed police actions, including knocking on journalists\u2019 doors over a deleted social media post. Yet I also believe it is wrong and indeed racist to abuse a group of men on the basis of the colour of their skin and an (incorrect) assumption about their nationality. To hold this opinion \u2013 that racists and misogynists should not have carte blanche to say what they like under the banner of free speech \u2013 does not make me part of cancel culture, but rather of a civilised one.</p> <p>Yet here we are on the frontline of the culture war, fighting the good fight over a bad tweet. And some fight it is. \u201cMy week of hell shows that the Britain we love and trust has gone,\u201d is Pearson\u2019s page 1 promoted, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/11/19/my-week-in-the-eye-of-the-storm/\">hyperbolic, lament in the Telegraph today</a>.</p> <p>It started with a visit by police on Remembrance Sunday to Pearson\u2019s house after a complaint was made that the writer had incited racial hatred. She claims that police did not tell her what the tweet in question was.</p> <p>Last Wednesday, instead of leading on the archbishop of Canterbury quitting in the wake of a sex abuse crisis, the Telegraph splashed on \u201cTelegraph writer in \u2018Kafkaesque\u2019 hate crime inquiry\u201d. The Pearson saga then continued to lead its front page for the next four days.

      "bodyText": "The Allison Pearson saga is nothing if not a morality tale about the modern media. Among its many learnings are that calling a group of people of colour holding a flag on social media \u201cJew haters\u201d is likely to get you into trouble. Apparently, though, it can also make you best mates with the world\u2019s richest man. On Monday night, almost exactly a year after the Telegraph writer posted her response to a picture of police officers alongside two men holding a flag on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, she was offering her \u201chuge thanks\u201d to the site\u2019s owner, Elon Musk, for his support. After he responded, she dubbed the billionaire with a powerful new job in the US government her \u201cnew bestie \u2665\ufe0f\u201d in a post to her 191,500 followers, including, in her words, \u201chundreds of black and Asian followers\u201d. Before explaining how we got here, to a situation where a stupid and since deleted tweet became a standard bearer for free speech across much of our media, it seems wise to pause and take a breath. Before adding another body to what has become a media pile-on, let me make clear that I believe free speech is a human right, fundamental to our democracy. I am also generally against heavy-handed police actions, including knocking on journalists\u2019 doors over a deleted social media post. Yet I also believe it is wrong and indeed racist to abuse a group of men on the basis of the colour of their skin and an (incorrect) assumption about their nationality. To hold this opinion \u2013 that racists and misogynists should not have carte blanche to say what they like under the banner of free speech \u2013 does not make me part of cancel culture, but rather of a civilised one. Yet here we are on the frontline of the culture war, fighting the good fight over a bad tweet. And some fight it is. \u201cMy week of hell shows that the Britain we love and trust has gone,\u201d is Pearson\u2019s page 1 promoted, hyperbolic, lament in the Telegraph today. It started with a visit by police on Remembrance Sunday to Pearson\u2019s house after a complaint was made that the writer had incited racial hatred. She claims that police did not tell her what the tweet in question was. Last Wednesday, instead of leading on the archbishop of Canterbury quitting in the wake of a sex abuse crisis, the Telegraph splashed on \u201cTelegraph writer in \u2018Kafkaesque\u2019 hate crime inquiry\u201d. The Pearson saga then continued to lead its front page for the next four days. Former prime minister Boris Johnson used his column in the Daily Mail to advise his successor to \u201cpolice the streets, not the tweets\u201d. Even BBC Radio 4\u2019s PM programme piled in with a discussion about where the bar should be set for non-crime hate incidents, before Essex police published a partial transcript of bodycam footage, pointing out that she was being investigated for an actual allegation of an actual crime under English law, namely potentially \u201cinciting racial hatred\u201d. After a Guardian exclusive revealed the details of what seems to be the tweet at the centre of the saga on Friday, some X users spread a claim that the tweet had been posted by a bot, rather than Pearson herself. But the tweet is alleged to have been Pearson\u2019s, and an account using her name appears to have mirrored the post from Pearson\u2019s account. When the original battle between writers and the state over free speech took off 400 years ago, it was the government that had all the power. Now politicians appear to be too afraid of the online mob to want much to do with it. Keir Starmer was halfway to Rio de Janeiro for the G20 summit when he was asked about the saga. In a non specific reply, he muttered something about the police needing to \u201cconcentrate on what matters most to their communities\u201d. When Pearson went public with her police run-in last week she asked: \u201cWho decides where you set the bar for what\u2019s offensive?\u201d The answer appears to be the owners of social media platforms, the arbiters of what is considered racist and inflammatory. Musk suggested, when he bought Twitter for $44bn, his aim was restoring \u201cfree speech\u201d. By Monday night, Pearson was asking her new best friend to buy the Telegraph, still up for sale 18 months after its previous owners failed to pay their debts: \u201cWould you like to buy a British newspaper? Excellent journalists, fine values, anti-woke, pro sanity and humour \u2013 needs caring owner.\u201d When John Milton wrote the seminal text in support of free speech 400 years ago, he named it Areopagitica after the hill in Athens \u2013 itself named after the god Ares \u2013 on which stood a court that handled important public business. In our current social media broligarchy, the world seems increasingly governed by a handful of very rich men, with Musk as Ares supporting those who believe they can say anything they like. The result is a \u201cwho shouts loudest\u201d social media culture that is killing trust in mainstream media, especially among young people. It\u2019s a playbook that encourages abuse, and most of us don\u2019t want to play any more. Musk supported Pearson by posting: \u201cThis needs to stop.\u201d He was right, if not in the way he believed.

September was the first time inflation had fallen below the Bank\u2019s 2% target since July 2021, and looks likely to be the last for a while.

      "bodyText": "Sydney trains are facing a weekend shutdown as the rail union strikes over an ongoing wage dispute with the New South Wales government. Here\u2019s what you need to know. When will the trains stop running? Sydney train services will stop running early on Friday morning, when the Rail, Tram and Bus Union\u2019s work ban begins. The strike will lift on Sunday morning but the NSW government has warned disruptions could extend throughout Sunday. Some disruption is also expected on Thursday, though earlier fears that the shutdown would start on Thursday have been resolved after last-minute meetings between unions and government on Tuesday night saw the start time pushed to Friday. Which lines will be affected? All train services in the Sydney city network will be affected, although the light rail will continue to run. There are already disruptions occurring across the network due to industrial action, with 100 services delayed or cancelled on Tuesday. Cancellations and delays have also already hit intercity lines connecting Sydney to Newcastle, Gosford, the Blue Mountains, the Southern Highlands and the south coast, due to a separate industrial action, Transport for NSW has said. What about the Metro line? The Metro will run as normal on Friday but will be closed for unrelated maintenance on Saturday and Sunday along the new half of the line, running between Tallawong and Chatswood but not running between Chatswood and Sydenham via the CBD. Are trains running for Pearl Jam or the A-League? The shutdowns will affect a number of special events around the city from Friday. Pearl Jam are due to perform in Sydney on Thursday and Saturday. Thursday\u2019s concert at Sydney Olympic Park will be serviced by the previously planned 86 special event services. Saturday\u2019s concert is expected to have no train services, as is the A-League\u2019s Unite Round, which involves six double-headers across Friday, Saturday and Sunday in the men\u2019s and women\u2019s competitions, at Allianz Stadium at Moore Park and Jubilee Stadium in Kogarah. That includes the men\u2019s derby between Sydney FC and Western Sydney Wanderers on Saturday night at Allianz. The A-League will run shuttle buses between Allianz and Jubilee and buses to Sydney from Newcastle and the Central Coast as planned, but no additional services to cover the shutdown have been announced. What other options are available for Sydney transport? Buses, light rail and ferries will run as normal. The government is hoping to provide additional services on other public transport options including buses and potentially ferries, but a Transport for NSW spokesperson has warned numbers will be limited. \u201cAcross Friday and Saturday there will be some replacement bus services but we are expecting major disruption and we\u2019re asking people to make other arrangements,\u201d the transport minister, Jo Haylen, said on Wednesday. An estimated one million people use the rail network each day, so roads, buses and other forms of transport are expected to suffer as commuters take alternative options. Rideshare services Didi and Uber have told the government they will limit surge pricing. Why are the trains shutting down? The rail unions have taken hundreds of industrial actions since September as they negotiate with the government over pay and conditions for about 14,000 train workers. The RTBU has demanded a 32% pay rise over four years, or 8% a year, while the government has offered a three-year agreement totalling 9.5% plus super. Both the RTBU and the government have said a deal is close and that they hope to reach agreement by Christmas. The union threatened to stop all work on the train lines unless the government runs trains overnight. Sydney trains typically stop running services between about midnight and 4am. Both sides have acknowledged the call for round-the-clock services is a bargaining chip in the wider pay dispute. \u201cWe want to see 24-hour services or we want to see the deal done,\u201d the RTBU NSW secretary, Toby Warnes, said on Wednesday. Haylen has said the network could not sustain an extended timetable on top of the union\u2019s other industrial actions, which she said had seen increasing delays and was \u201cdegrading\u201d the network. \u201cIf we continue to try and run 24-hour services over the weekend, the fact is it will eventually lead [to] the failure of our rail network,\u201d she said on Tuesday. The government had agreed to run 24-hour trains and avoided a shutdown after the union made the same demand last week, but Haylen said the extended timetable made repairs difficult and stretched the operator past its limit. Warnes said the union had offered a \u201cclear pathway\u201d to resolve maintenance concerns and run extra services, knocking back the government counter-offer. The government has opted not to force the unions to end their dispute by taking them to court, with Haylen saying the government would keep its options open but would prefer to resolve the issue cooperatively. The 24-hours strike threat has been notified indefinitely, meaning that weekend shutdown scares could arise every week until a deal is reached.",

      "bodyText": "The unending expansion of Netflix, still easily the most streamed of all the streamers, has turned it into an ambitious one-stop shop for all, home to both the elegant and the gaudy. This gap is never clearer than at the end of the year when the platform\u2019s prestigious Oscar-aiming fare is available alongside its cheapo Christmas movies, the same restaurant offering you both fillet mignon and beef jerky. Just last week, on the same day that Netflix released Jacques Audiard\u2019s acclaimed Cannes award-winning trans musical drama Emilia P\u00e9rez, it also launched Hot Frosty, a film starring Lacey Chabert as a woman falling for a snowman who comes to life. It\u2019s part of the appeal, the multitudes within, but again, this season, it has highlighted what the people really want. While Emilia P\u00e9rez has failed to crack the top 10 most watched, Hot Frosty remains at number one (Audiard\u2019s Oscar-buzzed movie is estimated to have entered 277,000 US households compared to the more than 1m reached by Christina Milian\u2019s perfectly entertaining Christmas movie out the week before). Netflix paid a reported $12m to buy Emilia Perez at Cannes, a sum that could essentially fund the entire season of micro-budgeted festive movies. So while viewers continue to shun the platform\u2019s awards fare (last year saw Maestro, Nyad, Rustin, American Symphony, El Conde and May December all underwhelm), one can bet they will gravitate towards this week\u2019s junky Christmas offering, the cheap and not quite cheerful enough comedy The Merry Gentlemen.

The ex-One Tree Hill star, who recently played toy boy to Brooke Shields in Netflix\u2019s summertime romcom Mother of the Bride, has them on display for a considerable amount of the movie, an attempt to liven up the formula with some sub-Magic Mike theatrics.

      "body": "<p><strong>\u201cI make R\u00faben Amorim the seventh Portuguese to manage in the Premier League,\u201d</strong> writes Daniel Keown. <strong>\u201cWhat\u2019s the record for a country outside the home nations? And have any major football countries not produced a Premier League manager?\u201d</strong></p> <p>On Sunday afternoon, at Portman Road, Amorim will indeed become the seventh Portuguese manager of a Premier League team. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was the first, when he joined Chelsea in 2004, and he was followed (in chronological order) by Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, Marco Silva, Carlos Carvalhal, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo and Bruno Lage.</p> <p>That puts Portugal joint-fifth on the list of nations outside Britain and Ireland. It\u2019s tight at the top: Enzo Maresca put Italy 15-14 ahead of Spain when he was appointed as Chelsea manager in the summer. Fifteen Spaniards have managed in the Premier League \u2013 but Bruno Saltor did so for only one game at Chelsea, in 2023, so he\u2019s bundled into the caretaker category with no right of appeal.</p> <p>We\u2019ve put the full list of countries with at least five managers below. But before the pedants and trolls get lively, here\u2019s the small print:</p> <ol> <li><p><em>We\u2019ve included temporary managers who were either in charge or originally appointed for a minimum of five Premier League games. That means Cristian Stellini makes the cut; Spurs appointed him for the last 10 games of the 2022-23, only to sack him after four. But Ruud van Nistelrooy isn\u2019t included as he was only ever appointed for two league games. The figure in parentheses covers your Van Nistelrooys and your </em><em>Saltors.</em></p></li> <li><p><em>Nationalities are taken from the official Premier League site. Technically there have been no African managers in the Premier League era, but Jean Tigana (France), Patrick Vieira (France) and Nuno </em><em>(Portugal) were born in Mali, Senegal, and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, respectively.</em></p></li> </ol> <p>Right, here\u2019s the list, with the managers in chronological order for each country.</p> <p><strong>Italy 15 (0): </strong>Attilio Lombardo, Gianluca Vialli, Claudio Ranieri, Gianfranco Zola, Carlo Ancelotti, Roberto Mancini, Roberto Di Matteo, Paolo Di Canio, Francesco Guidolin, Walter Mazzarri, Antonio Conte, Maurizio Sarri, Roberto De Zerbi, Cristian Stellini, Enzo Maresca.</p> <p><strong>Spain 14 (1): </strong>Rafael Ben\u00edtez, Juande Ramos, Roberto Mart\u00ednez, Pepe Mel, Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores, Aitor Karanka, Pep Guardiola, Javi Gracia, Unai Emery, Mikel Arteta, Xisco Mu\u00f1oz, Julen Lopetegui, Ruben Selles, Andoni Iraola. <em>Caretaker: Bruno Saltor.</em></p>    <p><strong>Netherlands 10 (1): </strong>Ruud Gullit, Martin Jol, Guus Hiddink, Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen, Louis van Gaal, Ronald Koeman, Dick Advocaat, Frank de Boer, Erik ten Hag, Arne Slot. <em>Caretaker: Ruud van Nistelrooy.</em></p> <p><strong>8 (0) France: </strong>Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, G\u00e9rard Houllier, Jean Tigana, Jacques Santini, Alain Perrin, Remi Garde, Claude Puel, Patrick Vieira.</p>    <p><strong>7 (0) Portugal: </strong>See above.</p> <p><strong>7 (0) Germany: </strong>Felix Magath, J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Jan Siewert, Daniel Farke, Thomas Tuchel, Ralf Rangnick, Fabian H\u00fcrzeler.</p> <p>As for the other home nations, Scotland are well out in front with 30 managers, excluding caretakers, although Russell Martin is the only one since 2017. We haven\u2019t listed them all because this thing has a word limit and we\u2019re throwing them away like confetti. And if you think we\u2019re cross-checking every English caretaker manager since 1992, you\u2019ve got another thing coming.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Scotland 30 (9)</strong></p></li> <li><p><strong>Wales 9 (3)</strong></p></li> <li><p><strong>Northern Ireland 7 (1)</strong></p></li> <li><p><strong>Republic of Ireland 6 (2)</strong></p></li> </ul> <p>As for the biggest country without a Premier League manager, you could change the question to the biggest continent. With the earlier caveat, no one from Africa or Asia has been in charge of a Premier League team.</p> <p>The biggest countries in Europe and the Americas without a Premier League manager include Colombia, Turkey, Mexico, Peru, Paraguay, Ukraine, Poland, Hungary, Russia, Slovakia (Jozef Venglos managed Aston Villa in the old Division One), Greece (though Ange Postecoglou was born there), Romania, Israel and the Czech Republic.</p> <h2>An end has an identical start</h2> <p><strong>\u201cLiverpool and Aston Villa are the only Premier League teams whose names begin and end with the same letter (discounting \u2018Football Club\u2019 and the like). In Scotland, three of 12 teams fit the criteria: Kilmarnock, Celtic and Dundee United,\u201d </strong>notes Matthew Chapman.<strong> \u201cWhich league has had the most such teams at any time?\u201d</strong></p> <p>\u201cIraq seems to be the place to go for this kind of thing,\u201d writes Jack Hayward, who has done the work. \u201cIn the 2024-25 Stars League, the country\u2019s top division, eight of the 20 participants match the criteria of this question, but there has been a higher number in the past.\u201cOn three occasions, the Iraqi Premier League, as it was known at the time, contained 10 teams \u2013 exactly 50% \u2013 whose names began and ended with the same letter. The 2017-18 season had these teams:</p> <ul> <li><p>Al-Zawraa</p></li> <li><p>Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya</p></li> <li><p>Al-Shorta</p></li> <li><p>Al-Kahrabaa</p></li> <li><p>Naft Maysan</p></li> <li><p>Al-Sinaat Al-Kahrabaiya</p></li> <li><p>Al-Samawa</p></li> <li><p>Al-Talaba</p></li> <li><p>Al-Minaa</p></li> <li><p>Al-Diwaniya</p></li> </ul> <p>\u201cAll of them stayed up to be in the 2018-19 campaign as well. They all started the 2019-20 edition too, but I won\u2019t count it as football was suspended early on due to Covid. Al-Samawa and Al-Diwaniya withdrew when the league was restarted, only for it to be abandoned again and the season annulled.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I will count is the 2020-21 season, which was played in full with the previously withdrawn teams returning to the league. Al-Samawa were relegated that year along with Al-Sinaat Al-Kahrabaiya, and the number of teams starting and ending with the same letter in Iraq\u2019s top flight hasn\u2019t hit double digits since.\u201d</p> <h2>Most international debut scorers in one game</h2> <p><strong>\u201cFour England players scored their first international goals against Ireland,\u201d</strong> notes Billy Dods (and dozens of others). <strong>\u201cHas there been a match at international or club level with more debut goals?\u201d</strong></p> <p>We can recall at least one: Norway 6-0 Jordan in 2023. With the Penalty Box Monster an unused substitute, all six Norwegian goals went to players who had not previously scored for their country: Antonio Nusa, Kristoffer Ajer, J\u00f8rgen Strand Larsen, Fredrik Andr\u00e9 Bj\u00f8rkan, Bard Finne and Hugo Vetlesen.</p> <p>The mind boggles at how many Erling Haaland would have scored.</p> <h2>Your unbeatables took one helluva beating (2)</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/13/the-knowledge-heaviest-defeat-to-end-a-long-unbeaten-run-in-football\">In last week\u2019s Knowledge</a></strong> we looked at unbeaten runs of 15 games or more that ended with a good old-fashioned doing, including Chelsea 5-0 Manchester United\u2019s Treble winners in 1999. Thanks to all of you who sent these additional examples:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>69 games (all domestic comps)</strong> Hearts 4-0 Celtic, Scottish Premiership, 2017-18</p></li> <li><p><strong>51 games (all comps)</strong> Atalanta 3-0 Bayer Leverkusen, Europa League final, 2023-24</p></li> <li><p><strong>45 games (all comps)</strong> Bayern Munich 5-0 Dinamo Zagreb, Champions League, 2015-16</p></li> <li><p><strong>44 games (league only) </strong>Watford 3-0 Liverpool, Premier League, 2019-20</p></li> <li><p><strong>21 (all comps)</strong> Borussia Dortmund 7-1 Celtic, Champions League, 2024-25</p></li> </ul>    <h2>Knowledge archive</h2> <p><strong>\u201cI\u2019m sure I remember a Panini (or such-like) sticker, back in the early 70s, with a Division One player crouched down over the ball with a cigarette clearly in his hand. Any Panini obsessives out there, ready to pan through their archives?\u201d </strong>asked Graeme Westwood in 2017.</p> <p>Kudos to John Chubb and David Poza, who both provided pictorial evidence that the player in question was the Crystal Palace centre-back Phil Hoadley. \u201cIt was in 1971-72, and the collection was from FKS Wonderful World of Soccer,\u201d wrote David. \u201cHoadley, who was on Palace\u2019s books from 1967 to 1972, appeared with cigarette in hand in the previous edition too.\u201d</p>    <p>Hoadley, who went on to be a pub landlord, began his career at Palace before spells at Leyton Orient and Norwich City, where he helped launch a good-health plan in 2010. He played in one of Orient\u2019s most famous victories, scoring a long-range screamer in their FA Cup fifth-round win over Chelsea in February 1972. It came second in the BBC\u2019s goal of the month competition \u2026 to Ronnie Radford.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjX_e_aQGg8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UjX_e_aQGg8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=Sport&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=The%20Knowledge&amp;description=Discover%20hundreds%20more%20questions%20and%20answers%20in%20our%20archives&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffootball%2Fseries%2Ftheknowledge&amp;links=false\" data-alt=\"Knowledge archive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=Sport&opinion-tint=false&title=The%20Knowledge&description=Discover%20hundreds%20more%20questions%20and%20answers%20in%20our%20archives&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffootball%2Fseries%2Ftheknowledge&links=false\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Can you help?</h2> <p>\u201cThe Scottish Championship fixtures for 16 November were 2nd v 1st; 3rd v 4th; 5th v 6th; 7th v 8th; and 9th v 10th,\u201d mails Phil Bowen. \u201cAre there other examples of this happenstance?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGermany beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 7-0 in Freiburg on Saturday.

We\u2019ve put the full list of countries with at least five managers below. But before the pedants and trolls get lively, here\u2019s the small print: We\u2019ve included temporary managers who were either in charge or originally appointed for a minimum of five Premier League games. That means Cristian Stellini makes the cut; Spurs appointed him for the last 10 games of the 2022-23, only to sack him after four. But Ruud van Nistelrooy isn\u2019t included as he was only ever appointed for two league games. The figure in parentheses covers your Van Nistelrooys and your Saltors. Nationalities are taken from the official Premier League site. Technically there have been no African managers in the Premier League era, but Jean Tigana (France), Patrick Vieira (France) and Nuno (Portugal) were born in Mali, Senegal, and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, respectively. Right, here\u2019s the list, with the managers in chronological order for each country. Italy 15 (0): Attilio Lombardo, Gianluca Vialli, Claudio Ranieri, Gianfranco Zola, Carlo Ancelotti, Roberto Mancini, Roberto Di Matteo, Paolo Di Canio, Francesco Guidolin, Walter Mazzarri, Antonio Conte, Maurizio Sarri, Roberto De Zerbi, Cristian Stellini, Enzo Maresca. Spain 14 (1): Rafael Ben\u00edtez, Juande Ramos, Roberto Mart\u00ednez, Pepe Mel, Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores, Aitor Karanka, Pep Guardiola, Javi Gracia, Unai Emery, Mikel Arteta, Xisco Mu\u00f1oz, Julen Lopetegui, Ruben Selles, Andoni Iraola. Caretaker: Bruno Saltor. Netherlands 10 (1): Ruud Gullit, Martin Jol, Guus Hiddink, Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen, Louis van Gaal, Ronald Koeman, Dick Advocaat, Frank de Boer, Erik ten Hag, Arne Slot. Caretaker: Ruud van Nistelrooy. 8 (0) France: Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, G\u00e9rard Houllier, Jean Tigana, Jacques Santini, Alain Perrin, Remi Garde, Claude Puel, Patrick Vieira. 7 (0) Portugal: See above. 7 (0) Germany: Felix Magath, J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Jan Siewert, Daniel Farke, Thomas Tuchel, Ralf Rangnick, Fabian H\u00fcrzeler. As for the other home nations, Scotland are well out in front with 30 managers, excluding caretakers, although Russell Martin is the only one since 2017. We haven\u2019t listed them all because this thing has a word limit and we\u2019re throwing them away like confetti. And if you think we\u2019re cross-checking every English caretaker manager since 1992, you\u2019ve got another thing coming. Scotland 30 (9) Wales 9 (3) Northern Ireland 7 (1) Republic of Ireland 6 (2) As for the biggest country without a Premier League manager, you could change the question to the biggest continent. With the earlier caveat, no one from Africa or Asia has been in charge of a Premier League team. The biggest countries in Europe and the Americas without a Premier League manager include Colombia, Turkey, Mexico, Peru, Paraguay, Ukraine, Poland, Hungary, Russia, Slovakia (Jozef Venglos managed Aston Villa in the old Division One), Greece (though Ange Postecoglou was born there), Romania, Israel and the Czech Republic. An end has an identical start \u201cLiverpool and Aston Villa are the only Premier League teams whose names begin and end with the same letter (discounting \u2018Football Club\u2019 and the like). In Scotland, three of 12 teams fit the criteria: Kilmarnock, Celtic and Dundee United,\u201d notes Matthew Chapman. \u201cWhich league has had the most such teams at any time?\u201d \u201cIraq seems to be the place to go for this kind of thing,\u201d writes Jack Hayward, who has done the work. \u201cIn the 2024-25 Stars League, the country\u2019s top division, eight of the 20 participants match the criteria of this question, but there has been a higher number in the past.\u201cOn three occasions, the Iraqi Premier League, as it was known at the time, contained 10 teams \u2013 exactly 50% \u2013 whose names began and ended with the same letter. The 2017-18 season had these teams: Al-Zawraa Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya Al-Shorta Al-Kahrabaa Naft Maysan Al-Sinaat Al-Kahrabaiya Al-Samawa Al-Talaba Al-Minaa Al-Diwaniya \u201cAll of them stayed up to be in the 2018-19 campaign as well. They all started the 2019-20 edition too, but I won\u2019t count it as football was suspended early on due to Covid. Al-Samawa and Al-Diwaniya withdrew when the league was restarted, only for it to be abandoned again and the season annulled. \u201cWhat I will count is the 2020-21 season, which was played in full with the previously withdrawn teams returning to the league. Al-Samawa were relegated that year along with Al-Sinaat Al-Kahrabaiya, and the number of teams starting and ending with the same letter in Iraq\u2019s top flight hasn\u2019t hit double digits since.\u201d Most international debut scorers in one game \u201cFour England players scored their first international goals against Ireland,\u201d notes Billy Dods (and dozens of others). \u201cHas there been a match at international or club level with more debut goals?\u201d We can recall at least one: Norway 6-0 Jordan in 2023. With the Penalty Box Monster an unused substitute, all six Norwegian goals went to players who had not previously scored for their country: Antonio Nusa, Kristoffer Ajer, J\u00f8rgen Strand Larsen, Fredrik Andr\u00e9 Bj\u00f8rkan, Bard Finne and Hugo Vetlesen. The mind boggles at how many Erling Haaland would have scored. Your unbeatables took one helluva beating (2) In last week\u2019s Knowledge we looked at unbeaten runs of 15 games or more that ended with a good old-fashioned doing, including Chelsea 5-0 Manchester United\u2019s Treble winners in 1999. Thanks to all of you who sent these additional examples: 69 games (all domestic comps) Hearts 4-0 Celtic, Scottish Premiership, 2017-18 51 games (all comps) Atalanta 3-0 Bayer Leverkusen, Europa League final, 2023-24 45 games (all comps) Bayern Munich 5-0 Dinamo Zagreb, Champions League, 2015-16 44 games (league only) Watford 3-0 Liverpool, Premier League, 2019-20 21 (all comps) Borussia Dortmund 7-1 Celtic, Champions League, 2024-25 Knowledge archive \u201cI\u2019m sure I remember a Panini (or such-like) sticker, back in the early 70s, with a Division One player crouched down over the ball with a cigarette clearly in his hand. Any Panini obsessives out there, ready to pan through their archives?\u201d asked Graeme Westwood in 2017. Kudos to John Chubb and David Poza, who both provided pictorial evidence that the player in question was the Crystal Palace centre-back Phil Hoadley. \u201cIt was in 1971-72, and the collection was from FKS Wonderful World of Soccer,\u201d wrote David. \u201cHoadley, who was on Palace\u2019s books from 1967 to 1972, appeared with cigarette in hand in the previous edition too.\u201d Hoadley, who went on to be a pub landlord, began his career at Palace before spells at Leyton Orient and Norwich City, where he helped launch a good-health plan in 2010. He played in one of Orient\u2019s most famous victories, scoring a long-range screamer in their FA Cup fifth-round win over Chelsea in February 1972. It came second in the BBC\u2019s goal of the month competition \u2026 to Ronnie Radford. Can you help? \u201cThe Scottish Championship fixtures for 16 November were 2nd v 1st; 3rd v 4th; 5th v 6th; 7th v 8th; and 9th v 10th,\u201d mails Phil Bowen. \u201cAre there other examples of this happenstance?\u201d \u201cGermany beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 7-0 in Freiburg on Saturday. Their last five games in Freiburg have finished 7-0, 7-0, 7-0, 7-0 and 8-2. A cumulative score of 36-2 across five matches on one ground has to be some kind of record, right?\u201d writes Christoph. \u201cThe five League One games played last weekend produced a total of three goals,\u201d begins Jonathan Tasker. \u201cIs the average 0.6 goals per game a record low for an English league matchday of at least that scale?\u201d \u201cCurtis Jones is the ninth Jones to play for the England men\u2019s team, after Alf, William, Harry, Herbert, Bill, Mick, Rob and Phil. Do any countries have a more capped surname?\u201d asks Jack Hayward. \u201cLet\u2019s say, hypothetically, that Trent Alexander-Arnold moves to Madrid in the summer and then Real meet Liverpool in the Champions League final,\u201d hypothesises Gavin O\u2019Sullivan. \u201cHe would be cup-tied but would be up for a winner\u2019s medal if his old club won the competition. Has this scenario ever happened before?\u201d Mail us your questions. Social media platform news to come",

      "body": "<p>One of Angela Hartnett\u2019s mantras for successful Christmas entertaining is \u201cless is more\u201d. Don\u2019t serve a dozen different vegetables that nobody wants, or attempt some wildly ambitious culinary experiment on the most pressured cooking day of the year.</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t apply the same restraint to her own guest list. \u201cGenerally, I\u2019m of the philosophy that if you\u2019re cooking for five, you can cook for 15,\u201d she says, though she and her partner Neil Borthwick, also a chef, often end up inviting even greater numbers to Christmas lunch. Sometimes, when there are 20-plus guests, they decamp to one of Hartnett\u2019s London restaurants \u2013 Murano in Mayfair&nbsp;or Caf\u00e9 Murano in Bermondsey \u2013 and take over the whole establishment.</p> <p>During Covid, however, they stayed at home with immediate family. \u201cIt felt really nice,\u201d Hartnett admits. \u201cWe thought, maybe we should do it like this every year.\u201d</p> <p>Both chefs declare themselves fans of the season. \u201cIt\u2019s always enjoyable, the restaurants are closed, you have all the family around you,\u201d says Borthwick, who runs the French House restaurant in Soho. But with so many mouths to feed and not quite enough space at home \u2013 their East End townhouse has a smallish basement kitchen and a modest-sized oven \u2013 how do they keep everything under control?</p>    <p>It\u2019s all down to preparation, says Hartnett. The night before, she preps the turkey, blanches the sprouts, peels the potatoes and makes the red cabbage side.</p> <p>\u201cOn Christmas morning, it\u2019ll be me and Neil doing the prep. I tend to organise it all and then nag Neil to do certain things. He makes really good sauces, and I\u2019m rubbish at butchery so he does the carving. I know it feels a bit sexist if the man is passed the turkey,\u201d she adds, \u201cbut he <em>is</em> very good at it.\u201d</p> <p>Borthwick also reminds her to slow down. \u201cI can sometimes be, \u2018Rush, rush, let\u2019s get it out, feed them,\u2019\u201d says Hartnett. \u201cAnd he\u2019s like, \u2018Let\u2019s take our time,\u2019 and he get the plates hot and serves it all really beautifully.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe do work pretty well together,\u201d nods Borthwick.</p> <p>Hartnett defers to Delia Smith when it comes to roast potatoes. \u201cI&nbsp;take a good roasting potato, peel and dice them into similar sizes and par-cook them. Drain&nbsp;them well, shake them in the pan so they fluff up, then put them into hot duck fat. Towards the end, I\u2019ll add in some rosemary and garlic, and finish them with salt.\u201d Hard to argue&nbsp;with that.</p> <p>Lunch is served early, around&nbsp;one, but they linger at the table till five or six, breaking off to open presents after the main course before returning for&nbsp;pudding.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re quite self-disciplined with presents,\u201d says Hartnett. \u201cWe don\u2019t have lots of young kids in the family and, to be honest, food&nbsp;is the bigger deal for us.\u201d</p> <p>Back at the table, she lays out desserts and cheese so guests can help themselves. \u201cMy aunt Viviana makes really great zabaglione,\u201d says Hartnett, \u201cso if we\u2019re lucky, we have that at the end.\u201d Often there are several Christmas puddings to choose from. \u201cI\u2019ve got a friend, Nicola, who makes them,\u201d says Hartnett, \u201cand then we\u2019ve had the St John Christmas pudding, and the Rick Stein one. When there\u2019s a few, we get my mum to judge. We do a blind tasting where Mum will go, \u2018That\u2019s the best.\u2019\u201d Hartnett chuckles. \u201cI\u2019m not going to dish on who won last year.\u201d</p> <p>Of her Christmas dinner menu&nbsp;for OFM, Hartnett says: \u201cThere are all the ingredients here for a wonderful holiday meal, but you don\u2019t need to go nuts because it\u2019s fairly fuss free. You\u2019ve got wonderful turkey, great accompaniments, nice gravy \u2013 and a dessert that doesn\u2019t need to be made weeks in advance. There\u2019s plenty for vegetarians too, and enough leftovers for the days after. This is a delicious, satisfying Christmas meal, but with just a little bit of preparation you won\u2019t feel overstretched on the day.\u201d</p> <h2>Starter</h2> <h2><em>Parsnip tarte&nbsp;tatin</em></h2>    <p>I did a similar recipe on the Dish podcast a few months back, with carrots; this is another version. It\u2019s a great vegetarian option and it looks really impressive when you turn it out with the parsnips beautifully caramelised and lovely spices on top. You could put carrots in there instead, or you could do it with onions and fennel \u2013 just make sure you\u2019re roasting off the vegetable to get the colour, then pack it in really tightly.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 6</strong></em><br><strong>ready-made puff pastry</strong> 1 x 500g block<br><strong>parsnips</strong> 700g, peeled<br><strong>olive oil </strong>1 tbsp <br><strong>cumin seeds</strong> \u00bd tsp <br><strong>ginger</strong> 1 thumb, grated<br><strong>maple syrup</strong> 2 tbsp <br><strong>unsalted butter</strong> 40g <br><strong>chicory</strong> to serve</p> <p><em><strong>For the salad dressing</strong></em><br><strong>olive oil</strong> 100ml <br><strong>red wine vinegar </strong>20ml <br><strong>Dijon mustard</strong> \u00bd tsp <br><strong>hazelnuts</strong> 1 tbsp, toasted and crushed</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the puff pastry to the thickness of a \u00a31 coin and trim to a 28cm circle. Place on to a floured board and leave to chill until needed.</p> <p>Cut the parsnips in half lengthways (or quarter them if thick). Put in a large roasting tin, season and add the olive oil, cumin seeds and grated ginger and toss to combine. Arrange in a single layer, cover with foil and roast for 25-30 minutes, or until the parsnips are cooked.</p> <p>Put a 25cm heavy-based ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat and add the maple syrup and&nbsp;butter. Heat until the maple syrup and butter have combined,&nbsp;then add the parsnips and toss together.</p> <p>Arrange the parsnips so they sit nice and tight in the pan, then allow to cool down.</p> <p>Take the puff pastry sheet and crimp it by gently twisting the edge so it folds over slightly to form a ridge.</p> <p>Turn the pastry over and place on to the cooled parsnips, then tuck the crimped edge around the parsnips so they fit tightly.</p> <p>With a sharp knife, make a couple of slashes into the pastry \u2013 this allows the steam to escape and ensures the pastry is cooked properly.</p> <p>Place in the oven and cook for&nbsp;25-30 minutes until golden and crisp.</p> <p>To serve, allow it to rest for a few minutes, then turn out on to a&nbsp;serving dish.</p> <p>Make the dressing by combining all the ingredients. Serve with the chicory leaves.</p>  <!-- Recipe element -->  <h2>Main</h2> <h2><em>Roast</em><em> turkey with rosemary, thyme and lemon butter</em></h2>    <p>There are so many ways of doing&nbsp;a&nbsp;roast turkey \u2013 brining it in&nbsp;this, covering it in that \u2013 but there\u2019s nothing wrong the classic approach: rubbing it with loads of butter mixed with hard herbs and lemon. I like to put bacon on top to keep it moist. I&nbsp;think those flavours really work well. Afterwards I like squeezing the roasted lemon over it. The pocket of air in the tin-foil case steams the turkey, which helps keep it moist.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 8, with leftovers</strong></em><br><strong>unwaxed lemons</strong> 2 <br><strong>salted butter</strong> 200g, softened<br><strong>thyme</strong> a handful, leaves picked and finely chopped, stalks reserved<br><strong>rosemary</strong> a handful, leaves picked and finely chopped, stalks reserved<br><strong>whole </strong><strong>free-range bronze turkey</strong> 4-6kg <br><strong>onions</strong> 2, peeled and cut into&nbsp;quarters<br><strong>thick streaky unsmoked bacon</strong> 10&nbsp;rashers <br><strong>carrots</strong> 2, peeled and cut into 5cm&nbsp;chunks<br><strong>celery</strong> 2 sticks, cut into 5cm&nbsp;chunks<br><strong>garlic</strong> 1 bulb, halved</p> <p>Zest the lemons, then cut them into quarters. In a bowl, mix together the butter, herbs and lemon zest; set aside while you prepare the turkey.</p> <p>Cut off the turkey wings, parson\u2019s nose and drumstick tips and set aside for the gravy. Stuff the turkey cavity with the quartered lemons, herb stalks and 1 of the onions. Truss the turkey legs together, if you like, with string. Pat the turkey skin dry with kitchen paper, then spread the herb butter evenly over the skin. Season the turkey. Arrange the bacon over the breasts and legs.</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200C fan/gas mark 7. Cut out two large pieces of tin foil, large enough to encompass the turkey with a bit extra, and place in a large roasting tin in a cross shape with the excess foil overhanging. Tip the carrots, celery and garlic into the foil-lined tray and rest the turkey on top, then wrap the foil around to encase the turkey, leaving a large air gap.</p> <p>Roast the turkey for 40 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 140C fan/gas mark 3. Continue to roast for 2\u00bd hours, unwrapping the foil and basting with the juices from time to time, then increase the oven temperature to 200C fan/gas mark 7 again.</p> <p>Take the turkey out of the oven, remove the foil and carefully drain off any surplus juices, keeping them for the gravy (see below for recipe). Baste the bird, then remove the bacon and return the turkey to the hot oven for about 30 minutes for the skin to brown and become crisp.</p> <p>To check it is cooked, put a meat&nbsp;thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh \u2013 it should be 70C. If not using a thermometer, pierce the thickest part of the thigh with a small sharp knife. If the juices run clear and there\u2019s no pink meat remaining, then the turkey is cooked; if not, then roast for a little longer, covering with foil if the turkey is already brown enough.</p> <p>Once cooked, remove from the oven, cover the turkey and leave to stand for at least 60 minutes before carving.</p>  <!-- Recipe element -->  <h2><em>Angela\u2019s turkey gravy</em></h2> <p><em><strong>Makes enough for 8 servings</strong></em><br><strong>onions</strong> 2, unpeeled and sliced into thin wedges<br><strong>garlic</strong> 4 cloves, crushed<br><strong>dried chilli flakes</strong> \u00bc tsp <br><strong>thyme</strong> 2 sprigs <br><strong>rosemary</strong> 2 sprigs <br><strong>celery</strong> 1 stick, sliced<br><strong>tomato pur</strong><strong>ee</strong> 2 tsp <br><strong>white wine</strong> 250ml <br><strong>chicken stock</strong> 700ml</p> <p>Remove the roasted veg from the tin used to roast the turkey and set aside. Pour the reserved turkey cooking juices into a jug and allow the fat to separate. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the fat and carefully skim the rest of it off into a separate jug (cool, chill, then use for future roasts).</p> <p>Set the turkey roasting tin on the hob and heat the reserved cooking fat, then add the onion wedges, crushed garlic, chilli, herbs and celery; cook for 5 minutes over a medium-high heat. Add the tomato puree and the reserved roasted vegetables and cook for 2 minutes.</p> <p>If using, add the reserved turkey trimmings to the tin and fry for a further 5 minutes until turning deep golden. Add the white wine, then cook, stirring, until reduced by half. Crush the vegetables and turkey trimmings (if using) with a masher or whisk to maximise the flavour.</p> <p>Add the reserved cooking juices and the chicken stock to the tin and simmer for a further 20 minutes. Strain the gravy through a sieve into a saucepan, season and keep warm until ready to use.</p> <h2>Vegetarian main</h2> <h2><em>Crespelle</em></h2>    <p>This is a recipe from my Auntie Maria. It\u2019s like a lasagne or cannelloni, really, but you make it with pancakes. Really thin pancakes, a lovely pumpkin and mushroom filling, fold them over. You can make the crespelle the day before and have them all ready in the tray, make the bechamel sauce separately, and then on Christmas Day reheat the bechamel so it\u2019s nice and loose, pour that over, then bake it in the oven while you\u2019re having your starter. It\u2019s a really lovely alternative for vegetarians.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 6</strong></em><br><em><strong>For the pancakes</strong></em><br><strong>plain flour</strong> 40g <br><strong>milk</strong> 8 tbsp <br><strong>egg</strong> 1 large <br><strong>salt</strong> a pinch <br><strong>butter</strong> 2 tbsp, for frying, plus a few knobs for the oven dish<br><strong>parmesan</strong> a sprinkle, for the oven dish</p> <p><em><strong>For the filling</strong></em><br><strong>olive oil </strong>for frying<br><strong>shallot</strong> 1, finely sliced<br><strong>garlic</strong> 1 clove, grated<br><strong>chestnut button mushrooms</strong> 100g <br><strong>salt and pepper</strong><br><strong>cooked pumpkin</strong> 300g, crushed lightly<br><strong>sage leaves</strong> a handful, torn</p> <p><em><strong>For the bechamel sauce</strong></em><br><strong>butter</strong> 50g <br><strong>milk</strong> 470ml <br><strong>plain flour</strong> 50g <br><strong>bay leaf</strong> 1 <br><strong>salt</strong> a pinch </p> <p>To make the pancake batter, sieve the flour into a bowl. With a whisk, beat in the milk, the egg and lastly the pinch of salt.</p> <p>Heat a 20cm crepe or frying pan over medium heat.</p> <p>Add a small amount of the 2&nbsp;tablespoons of butter to the pan and gently melt, rotating the pan so it is evenly coated. Add 2&nbsp;tablespoons of the batter.</p> <p>Remove from the heat and rotate the pan back and forth so the batter mix covers the bottom of the pan.</p> <p>Place back on to the heat and cook the crepes on the underside until light brown. Flip over and cook the other side.</p> <p>Remove from the pan and place on parchment paper.</p> <p>Continue to follow the same procedure until all the mixture is used (about 8 pancakes).</p> <p>To make the filling, in a pan, add&nbsp;a glug of olive oil, the shallots and the garlic, and lightly cook until soft.</p> <p>Add the mushrooms and saut\u00e9 with the shallots, then season to taste. To finish, add the crushed pumpkin and the torn sage leaves.</p> <p>Remove from the heat and allow to cool.</p> <p>To make the bechamel sauce, add the butter to a pan. Allow to melt and bubble without colouring. Add the flour and cook as a roux for 1 minute.</p> <p>Keep on a very low heat and gradually add the milk a couple of spoonfuls at a time, whisking quickly to avoid any lumps.</p> <p>When all the milk has been incorporated, add the bay leaf and salt, increase the heat and cook until it turns into a nice thick&nbsp;sauce.</p> <p>Remove from the heat, remove the bay leaf, and cover with parchment paper until ready to use \u2013 make sure it lies directly on the sauce to avoid lumps.</p> <p>To make the crepes, preheat the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6.</p> <p>Butter a rectangular ovenproof dish about 23cm wide and 8cm deep. Add a couple of spoonfuls of&nbsp;the bechamel to cover the base of the dish.</p> <p>Take the cooled filling mix and divide between the cooked pancakes. Fill each pancake and lightly roll them up like cigars, then place them carefully next to each other in the dish.</p> <p>Finish with the bechamel on top&nbsp;and a sprinkle of grated&nbsp;parmesan.</p> <p>Bake in the oven for 15 minutes&nbsp;until it turns golden brown and starts to bubble.

      "bodyText": "One of Angela Hartnett\u2019s mantras for successful Christmas entertaining is \u201cless is more\u201d. Don\u2019t serve a dozen different vegetables that nobody wants, or attempt some wildly ambitious culinary experiment on the most pressured cooking day of the year. She doesn\u2019t apply the same restraint to her own guest list. \u201cGenerally, I\u2019m of the philosophy that if you\u2019re cooking for five, you can cook for 15,\u201d she says, though she and her partner Neil Borthwick, also a chef, often end up inviting even greater numbers to Christmas lunch. Sometimes, when there are 20-plus guests, they decamp to one of Hartnett\u2019s London restaurants \u2013 Murano in Mayfair or Caf\u00e9 Murano in Bermondsey \u2013 and take over the whole establishment. During Covid, however, they stayed at home with immediate family. \u201cIt felt really nice,\u201d Hartnett admits. \u201cWe thought, maybe we should do it like this every year.\u201d Both chefs declare themselves fans of the season. \u201cIt\u2019s always enjoyable, the restaurants are closed, you have all the family around you,\u201d says Borthwick, who runs the French House restaurant in Soho. But with so many mouths to feed and not quite enough space at home \u2013 their East End townhouse has a smallish basement kitchen and a modest-sized oven \u2013 how do they keep everything under control? It\u2019s all down to preparation, says Hartnett. The night before, she preps the turkey, blanches the sprouts, peels the potatoes and makes the red cabbage side. \u201cOn Christmas morning, it\u2019ll be me and Neil doing the prep. I tend to organise it all and then nag Neil to do certain things. He makes really good sauces, and I\u2019m rubbish at butchery so he does the carving. I know it feels a bit sexist if the man is passed the turkey,\u201d she adds, \u201cbut he is very good at it.\u201d Borthwick also reminds her to slow down. \u201cI can sometimes be, \u2018Rush, rush, let\u2019s get it out, feed them,\u2019\u201d says Hartnett. \u201cAnd he\u2019s like, \u2018Let\u2019s take our time,\u2019 and he get the plates hot and serves it all really beautifully.\u201d \u201cWe do work pretty well together,\u201d nods Borthwick. Hartnett defers to Delia Smith when it comes to roast potatoes. \u201cI take a good roasting potato, peel and dice them into similar sizes and par-cook them. Drain them well, shake them in the pan so they fluff up, then put them into hot duck fat. Towards the end, I\u2019ll add in some rosemary and garlic, and finish them with salt.\u201d Hard to argue with that. Lunch is served early, around one, but they linger at the table till five or six, breaking off to open presents after the main course before returning for pudding. \u201cWe\u2019re quite self-disciplined with presents,\u201d says Hartnett. \u201cWe don\u2019t have lots of young kids in the family and, to be honest, food is the bigger deal for us.\u201d Back at the table, she lays out desserts and cheese so guests can help themselves. \u201cMy aunt Viviana makes really great zabaglione,\u201d says Hartnett, \u201cso if we\u2019re lucky, we have that at the end.\u201d Often there are several Christmas puddings to choose from. \u201cI\u2019ve got a friend, Nicola, who makes them,\u201d says Hartnett, \u201cand then we\u2019ve had the St John Christmas pudding, and the Rick Stein one. When there\u2019s a few, we get my mum to judge. We do a blind tasting where Mum will go, \u2018That\u2019s the best.\u2019\u201d Hartnett chuckles. \u201cI\u2019m not going to dish on who won last year.\u201d Of her Christmas dinner menu for OFM, Hartnett says: \u201cThere are all the ingredients here for a wonderful holiday meal, but you don\u2019t need to go nuts because it\u2019s fairly fuss free. You\u2019ve got wonderful turkey, great accompaniments, nice gravy \u2013 and a dessert that doesn\u2019t need to be made weeks in advance. There\u2019s plenty for vegetarians too, and enough leftovers for the days after. This is a delicious, satisfying Christmas meal, but with just a little bit of preparation you won\u2019t feel overstretched on the day.\u201d Starter Parsnip tarte tatin I did a similar recipe on the Dish podcast a few months back, with carrots; this is another version. It\u2019s a great vegetarian option and it looks really impressive when you turn it out with the parsnips beautifully caramelised and lovely spices on top. You could put carrots in there instead, or you could do it with onions and fennel \u2013 just make sure you\u2019re roasting off the vegetable to get the colour, then pack it in really tightly. Serves 6 ready-made puff pastry 1 x 500g block parsnips 700g, peeled olive oil 1 tbsp cumin seeds \u00bd tsp ginger 1 thumb, grated maple syrup 2 tbsp unsalted butter 40g chicory to serve For the salad dressing olive oil 100ml red wine vinegar 20ml Dijon mustard \u00bd tsp hazelnuts 1 tbsp, toasted and crushed Preheat the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the puff pastry to the thickness of a \u00a31 coin and trim to a 28cm circle. Place on to a floured board and leave to chill until needed. Cut the parsnips in half lengthways (or quarter them if thick). Put in a large roasting tin, season and add the olive oil, cumin seeds and grated ginger and toss to combine. Arrange in a single layer, cover with foil and roast for 25-30 minutes, or until the parsnips are cooked. Put a 25cm heavy-based ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat and add the maple syrup and butter. Heat until the maple syrup and butter have combined, then add the parsnips and toss together. Arrange the parsnips so they sit nice and tight in the pan, then allow to cool down. Take the puff pastry sheet and crimp it by gently twisting the edge so it folds over slightly to form a ridge. Turn the pastry over and place on to the cooled parsnips, then tuck the crimped edge around the parsnips so they fit tightly. With a sharp knife, make a couple of slashes into the pastry \u2013 this allows the steam to escape and ensures the pastry is cooked properly. Place in the oven and cook for 25-30 minutes until golden and crisp. To serve, allow it to rest for a few minutes, then turn out on to a serving dish. Make the dressing by combining all the ingredients. Serve with the chicory leaves. Main Roast turkey with rosemary, thyme and lemon butter There are so many ways of doing a roast turkey \u2013 brining it in this, covering it in that \u2013 but there\u2019s nothing wrong the classic approach: rubbing it with loads of butter mixed with hard herbs and lemon. I like to put bacon on top to keep it moist. I think those flavours really work well. Afterwards I like squeezing the roasted lemon over it. The pocket of air in the tin-foil case steams the turkey, which helps keep it moist. Serves 8, with leftovers unwaxed lemons 2 salted butter 200g, softened thyme a handful, leaves picked and finely chopped, stalks reserved rosemary a handful, leaves picked and finely chopped, stalks reserved whole free-range bronze turkey 4-6kg onions 2, peeled and cut into quarters thick streaky unsmoked bacon 10 rashers carrots 2, peeled and cut into 5cm chunks celery 2 sticks, cut into 5cm chunks garlic 1 bulb, halved Zest the lemons, then cut them into quarters. In a bowl, mix together the butter, herbs and lemon zest; set aside while you prepare the turkey. Cut off the turkey wings, parson\u2019s nose and drumstick tips and set aside for the gravy. Stuff the turkey cavity with the quartered lemons, herb stalks and 1 of the onions. Truss the turkey legs together, if you like, with string. Pat the turkey skin dry with kitchen paper, then spread the herb butter evenly over the skin. Season the turkey. Arrange the bacon over the breasts and legs. Preheat the oven to 200C fan/gas mark 7. Cut out two large pieces of tin foil, large enough to encompass the turkey with a bit extra, and place in a large roasting tin in a cross shape with the excess foil overhanging. Tip the carrots, celery and garlic into the foil-lined tray and rest the turkey on top, then wrap the foil around to encase the turkey, leaving a large air gap. Roast the turkey for 40 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 140C fan/gas mark 3. Continue to roast for 2\u00bd hours, unwrapping the foil and basting with the juices from time to time, then increase the oven temperature to 200C fan/gas mark 7 again. Take the turkey out of the oven, remove the foil and carefully drain off any surplus juices, keeping them for the gravy (see below for recipe). Baste the bird, then remove the bacon and return the turkey to the hot oven for about 30 minutes for the skin to brown and become crisp. To check it is cooked, put a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh \u2013 it should be 70C. If not using a thermometer, pierce the thickest part of the thigh with a small sharp knife. If the juices run clear and there\u2019s no pink meat remaining, then the turkey is cooked; if not, then roast for a little longer, covering with foil if the turkey is already brown enough. Once cooked, remove from the oven, cover the turkey and leave to stand for at least 60 minutes before carving. Angela\u2019s turkey gravy Makes enough for 8 servings onions 2, unpeeled and sliced into thin wedges garlic 4 cloves, crushed dried chilli flakes \u00bc tsp thyme 2 sprigs rosemary 2 sprigs celery 1 stick, sliced tomato puree 2 tsp white wine 250ml chicken stock 700ml Remove the roasted veg from the tin used to roast the turkey and set aside. Pour the reserved turkey cooking juices into a jug and allow the fat to separate. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the fat and carefully skim the rest of it off into a separate jug (cool, chill, then use for future roasts). Set the turkey roasting tin on the hob and heat the reserved cooking fat, then add the onion wedges, crushed garlic, chilli, herbs and celery; cook for 5 minutes over a medium-high heat. Add the tomato puree and the reserved roasted vegetables and cook for 2 minutes. If using, add the reserved turkey trimmings to the tin and fry for a further 5 minutes until turning deep golden. Add the white wine, then cook, stirring, until reduced by half. Crush the vegetables and turkey trimmings (if using) with a masher or whisk to maximise the flavour. Add the reserved cooking juices and the chicken stock to the tin and simmer for a further 20 minutes. Strain the gravy through a sieve into a saucepan, season and keep warm until ready to use. Vegetarian main Crespelle This is a recipe from my Auntie Maria. It\u2019s like a lasagne or cannelloni, really, but you make it with pancakes. Really thin pancakes, a lovely pumpkin and mushroom filling, fold them over. You can make the crespelle the day before and have them all ready in the tray, make the bechamel sauce separately, and then on Christmas Day reheat the bechamel so it\u2019s nice and loose, pour that over, then bake it in the oven while you\u2019re having your starter. It\u2019s a really lovely alternative for vegetarians. Serves 6 For the pancakes plain flour 40g milk 8 tbsp egg 1 large salt a pinch butter 2 tbsp, for frying, plus a few knobs for the oven dish parmesan a sprinkle, for the oven dish For the filling olive oil for frying shallot 1, finely sliced garlic 1 clove, grated chestnut button mushrooms 100g salt and pepper cooked pumpkin 300g, crushed lightly sage leaves a handful, torn For the bechamel sauce butter 50g milk 470ml plain flour 50g bay leaf 1 salt a pinch To make the pancake batter, sieve the flour into a bowl. With a whisk, beat in the milk, the egg and lastly the pinch of salt. Heat a 20cm crepe or frying pan over medium heat. Add a small amount of the 2 tablespoons of butter to the pan and gently melt, rotating the pan so it is evenly coated. Add 2 tablespoons of the batter. Remove from the heat and rotate the pan back and forth so the batter mix covers the bottom of the pan. Place back on to the heat and cook the crepes on the underside until light brown. Flip over and cook the other side. Remove from the pan and place on parchment paper. Continue to follow the same procedure until all the mixture is used (about 8 pancakes). To make the filling, in a pan, add a glug of olive oil, the shallots and the garlic, and lightly cook until soft. Add the mushrooms and saut\u00e9 with the shallots, then season to taste. To finish, add the crushed pumpkin and the torn sage leaves. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. To make the bechamel sauce, add the butter to a pan. Allow to melt and bubble without colouring. Add the flour and cook as a roux for 1 minute. Keep on a very low heat and gradually add the milk a couple of spoonfuls at a time, whisking quickly to avoid any lumps. When all the milk has been incorporated, add the bay leaf and salt, increase the heat and cook until it turns into a nice thick sauce. Remove from the heat, remove the bay leaf, and cover with parchment paper until ready to use \u2013 make sure it lies directly on the sauce to avoid lumps. To make the crepes, preheat the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6. Butter a rectangular ovenproof dish about 23cm wide and 8cm deep. Add a couple of spoonfuls of the bechamel to cover the base of the dish. Take the cooled filling mix and divide between the cooked pancakes. Fill each pancake and lightly roll them up like cigars, then place them carefully next to each other in the dish. Finish with the bechamel on top and a sprinkle of grated parmesan. Bake in the oven for 15 minutes until it turns golden brown and starts to bubble. Serve immediately. Sides Fennel and orange salad I know it sounds a bit bizarre having something cold on Christmas Day, but I think it\u2019s lovely. Oranges are in season, so this is a way of getting something fresh and citrussy on the table. It works well with cold meats the next day too. Serves 6 fennel 1 large head, sliced oranges 2, peeled, pith removed and segmented rocket 2 handfuls parsley a handful, roughly chopped olive oil 100ml orange juice 20ml dijon mustard 1 tsp garlic 1 small clove, crushed salted toasted almonds 1 tbsp, loosely chopped Place the prepared fennel, oranges, rocket and parsley in a large mixing bowl. Whisk the olive oil, orange juice, dijon mustard and garlic to make a vinaigrette. Just before serving, mix the salad and the dressing. Transfer to a serving platter and finish with the nuts. Serve immediately. Red cabbage This is Neil\u2019s recipe and it\u2019s really delicious. You can make it up to four days before and it will sit happily in the fridge and marinate. Along with roast potatoes (see introduction) and the fennel salad, you don\u2019t really need to do much else on the veg side. Serves 6 red cabbage 500g, cored and shredded juniper berries 20, bruised cardamom pods 2 cloves 10 cinnamon stick 10cm, broken into pieces star anise 3 red wine 300ml red wine vinegar 50ml goose fat 50g, or butter or olive oil if you prefer onion 1, sliced apple 1 redcurrant jelly 2 tbsp Put the cabbage in a bowl. Tie the spices up in muslin, nestle in the cabbage and pour over the wine and vinegar. Cover and marinate overnight in the fridge. The next day, drain the cabbage, reserving the marinade and spice bag. Melt the goose fat in a deep frying pan over a medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes, stirring, until soft. Add the cabbage and cook for 5 minutes. Add the reserved spice bag and marinade, then season. Place a circle of baking paper on the cabbage. Reduce the heat and cook gently for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Peel, core and grate the apple. Remove the baking paper from the pan, stir in the apple and cook over a medium heat for 10 minutes, until the apple is tender. Stir in the redcurrant jelly, check the seasoning and set aside, covered. Serve warm with the main. Pudding Zabaglione This is my aunt\u2019s recipe. If you\u2019re not into the traditional Christmas pudding or cakes, it\u2019s a really lovely, glamorous alternative. Make it the night before, put it in the fridge and it\u2019s all ready to go. Just take it out and serve it straight to your guests. You\u2019ll need 6 serving glasses, such as wine glasses or small glass bowls, with a couple of amaretti biscuits for each serving. Serves 6 egg yolks 6 caster sugar 150g marsala 120ml brandy 25ml sherry 25ml amaretti biscuits a handful, the crunchy kind, to serve Bring a saucepan of water to the boil, then turn it down to a simmer. Choose a mixing bowl that fits easily on the saucepan without touching the water. Add the egg yolks and sugar to the mixing bowl and whisk well. Whisk in the marsala and the other alcohol. Place the mixing bowl over the simmering water. Whisk in a figure of eight continuously until the mixture starts to foam and swell into a light soft mass; it should be very thick and hold any trails from the whisk. Remove from the heat and pour into the serving dishes. Place in the fridge to set and serve well chilled, or serve immediately to eat while still warm. Either way, just before serving, crumble over some amaretti biscuits.

This summer heartache is somewhat soothed, however, by comforting dishes from back home, such as today\u2019s <em>g\u00fcve\u00e7 </em>(stew) and fried cod, both of which are hearty and bracing, but also have at least a small hint of warmer times in the lemon, chilli and olives. Both work equally well as a dinner with friends as a meal to eat while wrapped up in a blanket on the couch.</p> <h2>Semolina-crusted fried cod with coriander and chilli ezme (pictured above)</h2> <p><em>Ezme</em> means \u201cto crush\u201d in Turkish. It\u2019s a salsa-like accompaniment to many a meal, including meats from the <em>mangal</em> (Turkish barbecue) and fish but, sometimes, it\u2019s so good it\u2019s the star of the show.</p> <p>Prep <strong>15-20 min<br></strong>Cook <strong>20 min<br></strong>Serves <strong>4</strong></p> <p>For the ezme<br><strong>1 green bell pepper</strong><strong><br>1-2 green finger chillies</strong>, to taste<br><strong>75g coriander </strong>(including stems), finely chopped<br><strong>2 spring onions</strong>, trimmed and finely sliced<br><strong>70ml extra-virgin olive oil<br>Juice of \u00bd</strong><strong> lemon</strong><strong><br>Flaky sea salt</strong>, to taste</p> <p>For the cod<br><strong>50g fine semolina<br>50g plain flour<br>Fine salt</strong>, to taste<br><strong>4 </strong><strong>skinless cod fillets</strong>, about 120g each<br><strong>Sunflower oil</strong>, for frying<strong><br>1 tbsp sumac<br>1 tbsp dried oregano</strong><br><br>To serve<br><strong>1 lemon</strong>, cut into wedges<br><strong>Buttered rice or potato wedges</strong></p> <p>First, make the ezme.

Once the peppers are cool enough to handle, scrape off most of the blackened skin \u2013 don\u2019t worry about getting it every last bit off, because it adds another layer of flavour. Cut open the peeled pepper and chillies, and remove the pith and seeds (if you like lots of heat, leave the chilli seeds in).

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m an island baby \u2013 my parents were born on the north side of Cyprus and I\u2019ve got sunshine running through my veins \u2013 so I spend all of the autumn and winter looking forward to sunnier days. This summer heartache is somewhat soothed, however, by comforting dishes from back home, such as today\u2019s g\u00fcve\u00e7 (stew) and fried cod, both of which are hearty and bracing, but also have at least a small hint of warmer times in the lemon, chilli and olives. Both work equally well as a dinner with friends as a meal to eat while wrapped up in a blanket on the couch. Semolina-crusted fried cod with coriander and chilli ezme (pictured above) Ezme means \u201cto crush\u201d in Turkish. It\u2019s a salsa-like accompaniment to many a meal, including meats from the mangal (Turkish barbecue) and fish but, sometimes, it\u2019s so good it\u2019s the star of the show. Prep 15-20 min Cook 20 min Serves 4 For the ezme 1 green bell pepper 1-2 green finger chillies, to taste 75g coriander (including stems), finely chopped 2 spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced 70ml extra-virgin olive oil Juice of \u00bd lemon Flaky sea salt, to taste For the cod 50g fine semolina 50g plain flour Fine salt, to taste 4 skinless cod fillets, about 120g each Sunflower oil, for frying 1 tbsp sumac 1 tbsp dried oregano To serve 1 lemon, cut into wedges Buttered rice or potato wedges First, make the ezme. Grill the green pepper and chillies under a hot grill, turning often, until blistered all over, then put in a bowl and cover. Once the peppers are cool enough to handle, scrape off most of the blackened skin \u2013 don\u2019t worry about getting it every last bit off, because it adds another layer of flavour. Cut open the peeled pepper and chillies, and remove the pith and seeds (if you like lots of heat, leave the chilli seeds in). Finely chop the pepper and chilli flesh, put it in a medium bowl, then add all the other ezme ingredients and stir to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning accordingly. Mix the semolina and flour in a wide, shallow bowl. Season each piece of fish lightly with salt, then dredge in the semolina mix until very well coated all over. Put the fish aside for five minutes, then give it another good coating of the semolina mix. Half-fill a large frying pan with sunflower oil and put it on a medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully lay in each piece of fish, leave to cook for two to three minutes, until golden and crisp underneath, then flip over and repeat on the other side. Use a slotted spoon or spatula to lift the fish on to a large plate lined with kitchen paper to drain, then season with fine salt, sumac and oregano. Serve each portion of fish with a big dollop of ezme, some lemon wedges on the side and buttered rice or potato wedges. Roots and brassicas g\u00fcve\u00e7 G\u00fcve\u00e7 is named after the clay pot it\u2019s cooked in, and you\u2019ll find iterations of this stew all across the eastern Mediterranean and Balkans.

Lai has been charged with one count of conspiracy to publish seditious publications and two counts of conspiracy to foreign collusion, under the city\u2019s punitive national security law (NSL), introduced in 2020. On Wednesday, Lai stridently defended himself against the charges and spoke proudly of the media company he founded, which has been a thorn in the side of Beijing and the Hong Kong government for decades.

      "body": "<p>In the autumn of 2018, I moved to Lisbon for a month-long course at the Universidade de Lisboa. I struggled to find any short-term sublets in the city, so the university stepped in to offer me a shared room in an all-male dormitory in an upmarket neighbourhood. I was surrounded by young, highly educated Portuguese students who all agreed upon one thing: after graduating, they would be leaving the country.</p> <p>Now the coalition government, the centre-right <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/29/portugal-election-who-are-the-key-players-and-what-is-at-stake\">Alian\u00e7a Democr\u00e1tica</a>, is using this year\u2019s budget to try to stem this brain drain and keep young graduates in Portugal. The proposed policy is a progressive, multi-year tax holiday for those aged 18 to 35 on annual salaries of up to \u20ac28,000 (\u00a323,360). But is this the right approach?</p> <p>Emigration is a huge issue that must be addressed by the country: roughly<a href=\"https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2024-01-12/30-of-young-portuguese-leave-the-country/85048\"> 30%</a> of young people born in Portugal now live and work abroad, representing the highest emigration rate in Europe.</p> <p>My own family history is captured in this statistic: my mum and my four grandparents emigrated to Canada from Portugal in an era when there were severely limited educational opportunities for them (a third of the population was illiterate in 1960, the year of my mother\u2019s birth). The current wave of migration is something else entirely, however: a generation armed with degrees in medicine, nursing and engineering without any prospect of obtaining well paid work in their home country.</p> <p>The impact of this loss is felt acutely in Portuguese society today. One stark example is the regular closure of obstetrics clinics, due to <a href=\"https://www.publico.pt/2022/06/13/sociedade/noticia/fecham-urgencias-obstetricia-2009846\">low staffing numbers</a>, which recently caused a woman in labour to <a href=\"https://cnnportugal.iol.pt/maternidades/urgencias/gravida-em-trabalho-de-parto-teve-de-fazer-quase-200-km-para-dar-a-luz/20240717/6698354fd34e049892234f71\">travel 200km</a> (125 miles) to find somewhere to give birth. </p> <p>In my Lisbon dorm, one of the first people I met was Paulo, a cheeky Brazilian-born student who had immigrated to Portugal as a child. He would spend hours in his room studying German alongside his maths and physics course books, trying to improve his grasp of what he called \u201ca language of opportunity\u201d.</p> <p>After graduating with a master\u2019s degree in civil engineering, he was offered an internship in Portugal. The annual salary was a barely believable \u20ac15,000 (\u00a312,500). He knew he had no choice but to cast his net wider. Eventually, Paulo received a job offer from a rail construction company based in Edmonton, Canada. I asked him what he thought about the proposed change to the tax regime for young people. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very interesting policy, but it really doesn\u2019t change our lives.\u201d</p> <p>Ever the engineer, he broke down the maths for me and said that the tax holiday still wouldn\u2019t leave enough money for him to stay. Wages needed to be higher in the first instance, and to earn significantly more than what he was initially offered in Portugal represented a near-impossibility: \u201cYou would have to be a unicorn.\u201d The data bolsters his argument: only 2% of workers in Portugal aged 18 to 35 <a href=\"https://expresso.pt/politica/eleicoes/legislativas-2024/grandes-temas/2024-02-25-75-dos-jovens-ganham-ate-mil-euros.-Como-e-que-os-partidos-pretendem-mudar-isso--ae3c09be\">earn more than \u20ac41,000 annually</a> (\u00a334,200).</p> <p>Melissa Sobral is part of this generation of emigrants. She moved to Switzerland in 2014, now the <a href=\"https://www.essential-business.pt/2024/02/02/switzerland-overtakes-uk-as-main-destination-for-60000-as-portugal-brain-drain-continues/\">second-most popular destination</a> for Portuguese emigrants with a population of about 260,000. She works as an accountant and lives with her husband and newborn son in the city of Martigny.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/09/in-an-increasingly-uncertain-world-we-europeans-must-be-bold-and-build-hope\">In an increasingly uncertain world, we Europeans must be bold and build hope | Stella Creasey and Sandro Gozi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis won\u2019t be why people return or not,\u201d she responded when I asked if the proposed policy enticed her. \u201cThe situation for us in Portugal is not good.

      "bodyText": "In the autumn of 2018, I moved to Lisbon for a month-long course at the Universidade de Lisboa. I struggled to find any short-term sublets in the city, so the university stepped in to offer me a shared room in an all-male dormitory in an upmarket neighbourhood. I was surrounded by young, highly educated Portuguese students who all agreed upon one thing: after graduating, they would be leaving the country. Now the coalition government, the centre-right Alian\u00e7a Democr\u00e1tica, is using this year\u2019s budget to try to stem this brain drain and keep young graduates in Portugal. The proposed policy is a progressive, multi-year tax holiday for those aged 18 to 35 on annual salaries of up to \u20ac28,000 (\u00a323,360). But is this the right approach? Emigration is a huge issue that must be addressed by the country: roughly 30% of young people born in Portugal now live and work abroad, representing the highest emigration rate in Europe. My own family history is captured in this statistic: my mum and my four grandparents emigrated to Canada from Portugal in an era when there were severely limited educational opportunities for them (a third of the population was illiterate in 1960, the year of my mother\u2019s birth). The current wave of migration is something else entirely, however: a generation armed with degrees in medicine, nursing and engineering without any prospect of obtaining well paid work in their home country. The impact of this loss is felt acutely in Portuguese society today. One stark example is the regular closure of obstetrics clinics, due to low staffing numbers, which recently caused a woman in labour to travel 200km (125 miles) to find somewhere to give birth. In my Lisbon dorm, one of the first people I met was Paulo, a cheeky Brazilian-born student who had immigrated to Portugal as a child. He would spend hours in his room studying German alongside his maths and physics course books, trying to improve his grasp of what he called \u201ca language of opportunity\u201d. After graduating with a master\u2019s degree in civil engineering, he was offered an internship in Portugal. The annual salary was a barely believable \u20ac15,000 (\u00a312,500). He knew he had no choice but to cast his net wider. Eventually, Paulo received a job offer from a rail construction company based in Edmonton, Canada. I asked him what he thought about the proposed change to the tax regime for young people. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very interesting policy, but it really doesn\u2019t change our lives.\u201d Ever the engineer, he broke down the maths for me and said that the tax holiday still wouldn\u2019t leave enough money for him to stay. Wages needed to be higher in the first instance, and to earn significantly more than what he was initially offered in Portugal represented a near-impossibility: \u201cYou would have to be a unicorn.\u201d The data bolsters his argument: only 2% of workers in Portugal aged 18 to 35 earn more than \u20ac41,000 annually (\u00a334,200). Melissa Sobral is part of this generation of emigrants. She moved to Switzerland in 2014, now the second-most popular destination for Portuguese emigrants with a population of about 260,000. She works as an accountant and lives with her husband and newborn son in the city of Martigny. \u201cThis won\u2019t be why people return or not,\u201d she responded when I asked if the proposed policy enticed her. \u201cThe situation for us in Portugal is not good. They pay poorly, there are no jobs, and we don\u2019t get the recognition we deserve.\u201d She says the only reason she is considering moving back is to be closer to family, especially since the birth of her son. I was also struck by a very strange paradox currently taking place in Portugal: my former classmates were desperate to find jobs in Canada, the UK and the US, while simultaneously young people from these countries are flocking to Portugal as digital nomads. \u201cIt\u2019s a little frustrating,\u201d says Paulo. \u201cThey are the unicorns we can only dream of being, but never will be in Portugal.\u201d Depriving the public purse of much needed revenue and critical capacity won\u2019t solve Portugal\u2019s problems; it will only worsen them. The country\u2019s ability to improve its healthcare system and keep medical professionals depends greatly on public investment through tax collection. The International Monetary Fund has also highlighted a major concern: there is no proof this radical and costly measure \u2013 currently estimated at \u20ac525m (\u00a3438m) \u2013 will even be successful. This money would be better spent on increasing the wages of civil servants, teachers and transport workers, with unions representing these workers going on strike in the past month alone. If these well deserved pay rises are too costly, perhaps the wealthy retirees and digital nomads on generous tax regimes wouldn\u2019t mind chipping in a bit more for the price of paradise.

Mediha Ibrahim Alhamad is a teenage girl from Kurdish northern Iraq and a member of the Yazidi religious group, subject to much bigotry from extreme Islamism. Oswald appears <a href=\"https://moveablefest.com/hasan-oswald-mediha-interview/\">to have come across her extraordinary story quite by chance</a>, when he was told about it by his Yazidi translator while working in the region on a quite different project.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/mar/12/mediha-film-yazidi-islamic-state-survivor-story-premieres-uk\">\u2018Nobody would listen to me, so I told the camera\u2019: film of Islamic State survivor\u2019s story premieres in UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2014, Mediha\u2019s family was shattered by the Islamic State massacre of their village in Sinjar. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/03/iraqs-yazidis-gather-to-remember-the-dead-and-missing-10-years-on-from-islamic-state-genocide\">Thousands of Yazidi were kidnapped; the women were sold into sexual slavery</a>, and the boys often forced to be child soldiers. Mediha and two of her three brothers were finally brought back; her father is presumed dead but her third brother and mother are thought to be still alive. For a lot of the time, Oswald simply hands the camera over to Mediha (and sometimes her brothers) and lets her show us, with honesty and unaffected charm, her life with her kindly, careworn uncle, pursuing a legal action against her captor, having therapy for PTSD and trying not to lose hope as various aid workers bring news of possible sightings of missing family members.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8bvCpQNL_g\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/G8bvCpQNL_g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>It is heartbreaking when Mediha, old beyond her years, tells us: \u201cI never told my brothers what happened to me \u2026\u201d and then the camera shows the boys quite happily fooling around and playing football. The most agonising thing concerning their missing mother \u2013 whose resemblance to Mediha is eerie \u2013 is that she may well have had more children with her IS jailor-husband or husbands, and faces what someone here calls a \u201cSophie\u2019s Choice\u201d if she is rescued; she can\u2019t bring her new children with her. It\u2019s a remarkable story of real-life courage \u2013 that is, the courage to face both the past and a complicated, fractured future yet to come.</p> <p>\u2022 Mediha is in UK and Irish cinemas from 22 November.</p> <p>\u2022 In the UK, the <a href=\"https://www.nspcc.org.uk/\">NSPCC</a> offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

      "bodyText": "This is impressive work from film-maker Hasan Oswald that allows its subject, as far as possible, to tell her own story. Mediha Ibrahim Alhamad is a teenage girl from Kurdish northern Iraq and a member of the Yazidi religious group, subject to much bigotry from extreme Islamism. Oswald appears to have come across her extraordinary story quite by chance, when he was told about it by his Yazidi translator while working in the region on a quite different project. In 2014, Mediha\u2019s family was shattered by the Islamic State massacre of their village in Sinjar. Thousands of Yazidi were kidnapped; the women were sold into sexual slavery, and the boys often forced to be child soldiers. Mediha and two of her three brothers were finally brought back; her father is presumed dead but her third brother and mother are thought to be still alive. For a lot of the time, Oswald simply hands the camera over to Mediha (and sometimes her brothers) and lets her show us, with honesty and unaffected charm, her life with her kindly, careworn uncle, pursuing a legal action against her captor, having therapy for PTSD and trying not to lose hope as various aid workers bring news of possible sightings of missing family members. It is heartbreaking when Mediha, old beyond her years, tells us: \u201cI never told my brothers what happened to me \u2026\u201d and then the camera shows the boys quite happily fooling around and playing football. The most agonising thing concerning their missing mother \u2013 whose resemblance to Mediha is eerie \u2013 is that she may well have had more children with her IS jailor-husband or husbands, and faces what someone here calls a \u201cSophie\u2019s Choice\u201d if she is rescued; she can\u2019t bring her new children with her. It\u2019s a remarkable story of real-life courage \u2013 that is, the courage to face both the past and a complicated, fractured future yet to come. \u2022 Mediha is in UK and Irish cinemas from 22 November. \u2022 In the UK, the NSPCC offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000. The National Association for People Abused in Childhood (Napac) offers support for adult survivors on 0808 801 0331. In the US, call or text the Childhelp abuse hotline on 800-422-4453. In Australia, children, young adults, parents and teachers can contact the Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800; adult survivors can seek help at Blue Knot Foundation on 1300 657 380.

      "body": "<p>Good morning.</p> <p>More than 10,000 of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/19/farmer-protest-london-inheritance-tax-uk-politics-live-news-updates\">farmers descended on Westminster</a> yesterday to protest against the Labour government\u2019s changes to inheritance tax, which they describe as a \u201cbetrayal\u201d that represents an existential threat to British family farming.</p> <p>From April 2026, agricultural assets exceeding \u00a31m in value will become subject to inheritance tax, at a reduced rate of 20% rather than the standard 40%. Currently, farmers qualify for 100% relief on inheritance tax for agricultural and business property \u2013 a mechanism that, while occasionally exploited by wealthy land purchasers, has been crucial in enabling farms to be passed down from generation to generation.</p> <p>The government has steadfastly maintained that the new proposal is \u201cbalanced\u201d and \u201cproportionate\u201d \u2013 but that characterisation is vehemently rejected by farming communities, who see the policy as potentially decimating small and medium-sized agricultural enterprises.</p> <p>To untangle the policy, and the protests, for today\u2019s newsletter I spoke with the Guardian\u2019s environment reporter <em><strong>Helena Horton</strong></em> and Europe environment correspondent <em><strong>Ajit Niranjan</strong></em> about what the UK\u2019s agricultural discontent reveals about broader international farming tensions. That\u2019s right after the headlines. </p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Ukraine</strong></em> | Ukraine\u2019s power network is at \u201cheightened risk of catastrophic failure\u201d after Russia\u2019s missile and drone attack on Sunday, Greenpeace has warned, raising fears about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/20/latest-russian-airstrikes-on-ukraine-threaten-catastrophic-power-failure\">safety of the country\u2019s three operational nuclear power stations.</a> The strikes by Russia were aimed at electricity substations \u201ccritical to the operation of Ukraine\u2019s nuclear plants\u201d and there is a possibility that the reactors could lose power and become unsafe, according to a briefing note prepared for the Guardian.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Social media </strong></em>| British MPs are to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/nov/20/mps-summon-elon-musk-x-role-uk-summer-riots\">summon Elon Musk to testify about X\u2019s role </a>in spreading disinformation, in a parliamentary inquiry into the UK riots and the rise of false and harmful AI content, the Guardian has learned. </p></li> <li><p><em><strong>France</strong></em> | Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, who was drugged by her husband and allegedly raped by dozens of men he invited into her bedroom for more than a decade, has told a court that \u201cmacho\u201d society <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/gisele-pelicot-says-macho-society-must-change-attitude-on\">must change its attitude to rape</a>.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Music </strong></em>| The value of the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/20/value-of-uk-music-industry-hits-record-elton-john-beyonce\"> UK music industry has hit a record \u00a37.6bn </a>after superstar acts including Elton John, Beyonc\u00e9, Coldplay and Ed Sheeran embarked on Covid-delayed tours to cash in on pent-up fan demand for live shows.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Environment</strong></em> | England\u2019s national parks face a 12% real-terms cut to their budget, which would lead to mass redundancies of wardens and the closure of visitor centres and other facilities, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/19/england-national-parks-facing-financial-peril-due-to-budget-cuts\">park leaders have warned</a>. </p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: \u2018An almost unsalvageable tension\u2019</h2>    <p>The government claims that only 500 estates a year will pay more under the new scheme, but the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) and the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) estimate that up to 70,000 farms could be affected. Tom Bradshaw, the NFU president, said the government\u2019s figures were \u201cmisleading\u201d because they failed to acknowledge that the new rule rolls together agricultural property relief and business property relief, which used to give separate allowances to farmers. Many farmers will pass the \u00a31m asset threshold because a single combine harvester, say, can be worth up to \u00a3500,000. However, the government says each parent can pass on half a million tax-free to their children, on top of farm assets. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/19/the-guardian-view-on-taxing-farmers-big-landowners-must-pay-their-share\">Add it all up and families could hand over \u00a32m to \u00a33m without paying inheritance tax</a>.</p> <p>Even though Labour has said that this will only affect the wealthiest, in reality aristocratic estates will be able to exploit a loophole \u2013 the heritage cultural asset \u2013 which means they will not have to pay any inheritance tax at all. \u201cThat includes 350 members of the landed gentry,\u201d Helena says.</p> <p>Many farmers face a financial bind: while their land is worth a lot on paper, their actual farming profits are minimal, which, they say, leaves them unable to pay inheritance tax bills that could run to hundreds of thousands of pounds. The new policy gives farmers 10 years to pay off the tax, but for many people the vast majority, if not all, of the income from their farm will go towards their tax bill. That means the only way to pay is to sell off parts of their land.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, farms require a certain amount of land to be viable, because they need the land to grow crops or graze animals, so they may have to sell the whole thing, or as a country we could end up having farms that are less productive,\u201d Helena adds. This tax, many say, will probably further disincentivise people from going into land farming.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>How Labour has responded</strong></p> <p>The government\u2019s stance on the issue remains steadfast in the face of mounting scrutiny. In a revealing pre-protest briefing, BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme cited a government communication that dismissively characterised farmers as a \u201cwell-organised, self-serving, noisy\u201d collective requiring governmental intervention.</p> <p>Helena says the government\u2019s refusal to backdown is largely a political calculation rather than a policy one. \u201cThey have maintained their position on the winter fuel allowance, which caused huge amounts of anger, and the two-child benefit cap, which led to MPs having the whip revoked.\u201d The government sees a political vulnerability in capitulating here: \u201cA reversal on this could bring a resurgence on those issues,\u201d Helena says.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>A European conundrum</strong></p>    <p>The turmoil over farming is not unique to the UK. But British farmers have historically been far more docile than their European counterparts, who have been fiercely clashing with their governments and the EU about the future of the agricultural industry. Farmers in Europe notoriously wield enormous political power \u2013 indeed, one-third of the EU\u2019s overall budget goes directly to farmers.</p> <p>Most countries in Europe have been unable to draft legislation that both supports farmers and their livelihoods and sticks to climate targets. When Germany <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/15/thousands-tractors-block-berlin-farmers-protest-fuel-subsidy-cuts\">tried to cut fuel subsidies</a> to farmers, 30,000 protesters descended on Berlin and brought the city to a standstill. \u201cIt was a national source of huge, huge conflict,\u201d Ajit says.</p> <p>In the Netherlands, a country that produces large volumes of dairy products, the government crackdown on harmful nitrogen pollution was met with furious and recurring protests that garnered global attention. Farmers dumped manure on highways and set hay bales alight.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a lot of valid criticism of the way the Dutch government handled it, but the fundamental idea that farmers should produce less nitrogen in this tiny country where the rivers and soil are filled with the stuff was itself a source of anger,\u201d Ajit said. \u201cThe Netherlands has seemingly gotten itself into a situation with an almost unsalvageable tension on this issue\u201d. In Spain, Portugal, Poland and Belgium, farmers have railed against regulation, climate action, high costs and dwindling margins.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Is any country not at war with its farmers?</strong></p> <p>Denmark is the only country in the world that has pursued a relatively ambitious environmental policy while achieving some level of political consensus. This week, it implemented the world\u2019s first tax on agricultural emissions (including, yes, livestock flatulence).

The agricultural tensions have transcended European borders, becoming \u201crallying cries\u201d in the US and Canada, with far-right commentators weaponising European agricultural policy as a cautionary tale of governmental overreach.</p> <p>Alarmed by the electoral momentum of these fringe movements, centrist and centre-right political entities have responded not by addressing the systemic issues \u2013 which has in part caused the income gap between small and big farms to dramatically widen and led to thousands of small farms to shut down each year \u2013 but by strategically abandoning green policy initiatives.</p> <p>\u201cThere still needs to be a societal conversation about how we reimagine what farming will be like in the future,\u201d Ajit says.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. More than 10,000 of farmers descended on Westminster yesterday to protest against the Labour government\u2019s changes to inheritance tax, which they describe as a \u201cbetrayal\u201d that represents an existential threat to British family farming. From April 2026, agricultural assets exceeding \u00a31m in value will become subject to inheritance tax, at a reduced rate of 20% rather than the standard 40%. Currently, farmers qualify for 100% relief on inheritance tax for agricultural and business property \u2013 a mechanism that, while occasionally exploited by wealthy land purchasers, has been crucial in enabling farms to be passed down from generation to generation. The government has steadfastly maintained that the new proposal is \u201cbalanced\u201d and \u201cproportionate\u201d \u2013 but that characterisation is vehemently rejected by farming communities, who see the policy as potentially decimating small and medium-sized agricultural enterprises. To untangle the policy, and the protests, for today\u2019s newsletter I spoke with the Guardian\u2019s environment reporter Helena Horton and Europe environment correspondent Ajit Niranjan about what the UK\u2019s agricultural discontent reveals about broader international farming tensions. That\u2019s right after the headlines. Five big stories Ukraine | Ukraine\u2019s power network is at \u201cheightened risk of catastrophic failure\u201d after Russia\u2019s missile and drone attack on Sunday, Greenpeace has warned, raising fears about the safety of the country\u2019s three operational nuclear power stations. The strikes by Russia were aimed at electricity substations \u201ccritical to the operation of Ukraine\u2019s nuclear plants\u201d and there is a possibility that the reactors could lose power and become unsafe, according to a briefing note prepared for the Guardian. Social media | British MPs are to summon Elon Musk to testify about X\u2019s role in spreading disinformation, in a parliamentary inquiry into the UK riots and the rise of false and harmful AI content, the Guardian has learned. France | Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, who was drugged by her husband and allegedly raped by dozens of men he invited into her bedroom for more than a decade, has told a court that \u201cmacho\u201d society must change its attitude to rape. Music | The value of the UK music industry has hit a record \u00a37.6bn after superstar acts including Elton John, Beyonc\u00e9, Coldplay and Ed Sheeran embarked on Covid-delayed tours to cash in on pent-up fan demand for live shows. Environment | England\u2019s national parks face a 12% real-terms cut to their budget, which would lead to mass redundancies of wardens and the closure of visitor centres and other facilities, park leaders have warned. In depth: \u2018An almost unsalvageable tension\u2019 The government claims that only 500 estates a year will pay more under the new scheme, but the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) and the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) estimate that up to 70,000 farms could be affected. Tom Bradshaw, the NFU president, said the government\u2019s figures were \u201cmisleading\u201d because they failed to acknowledge that the new rule rolls together agricultural property relief and business property relief, which used to give separate allowances to farmers. Many farmers will pass the \u00a31m asset threshold because a single combine harvester, say, can be worth up to \u00a3500,000. However, the government says each parent can pass on half a million tax-free to their children, on top of farm assets. Add it all up and families could hand over \u00a32m to \u00a33m without paying inheritance tax. Even though Labour has said that this will only affect the wealthiest, in reality aristocratic estates will be able to exploit a loophole \u2013 the heritage cultural asset \u2013 which means they will not have to pay any inheritance tax at all. \u201cThat includes 350 members of the landed gentry,\u201d Helena says. Many farmers face a financial bind: while their land is worth a lot on paper, their actual farming profits are minimal, which, they say, leaves them unable to pay inheritance tax bills that could run to hundreds of thousands of pounds. The new policy gives farmers 10 years to pay off the tax, but for many people the vast majority, if not all, of the income from their farm will go towards their tax bill. That means the only way to pay is to sell off parts of their land. \u201cHowever, farms require a certain amount of land to be viable, because they need the land to grow crops or graze animals, so they may have to sell the whole thing, or as a country we could end up having farms that are less productive,\u201d Helena adds. This tax, many say, will probably further disincentivise people from going into land farming. *** How Labour has responded The government\u2019s stance on the issue remains steadfast in the face of mounting scrutiny. In a revealing pre-protest briefing, BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme cited a government communication that dismissively characterised farmers as a \u201cwell-organised, self-serving, noisy\u201d collective requiring governmental intervention. Helena says the government\u2019s refusal to backdown is largely a political calculation rather than a policy one. \u201cThey have maintained their position on the winter fuel allowance, which caused huge amounts of anger, and the two-child benefit cap, which led to MPs having the whip revoked.\u201d The government sees a political vulnerability in capitulating here: \u201cA reversal on this could bring a resurgence on those issues,\u201d Helena says. *** A European conundrum The turmoil over farming is not unique to the UK. But British farmers have historically been far more docile than their European counterparts, who have been fiercely clashing with their governments and the EU about the future of the agricultural industry. Farmers in Europe notoriously wield enormous political power \u2013 indeed, one-third of the EU\u2019s overall budget goes directly to farmers. Most countries in Europe have been unable to draft legislation that both supports farmers and their livelihoods and sticks to climate targets. When Germany tried to cut fuel subsidies to farmers, 30,000 protesters descended on Berlin and brought the city to a standstill. \u201cIt was a national source of huge, huge conflict,\u201d Ajit says. In the Netherlands, a country that produces large volumes of dairy products, the government crackdown on harmful nitrogen pollution was met with furious and recurring protests that garnered global attention. Farmers dumped manure on highways and set hay bales alight. \u201cThere has been a lot of valid criticism of the way the Dutch government handled it, but the fundamental idea that farmers should produce less nitrogen in this tiny country where the rivers and soil are filled with the stuff was itself a source of anger,\u201d Ajit said. \u201cThe Netherlands has seemingly gotten itself into a situation with an almost unsalvageable tension on this issue\u201d. In Spain, Portugal, Poland and Belgium, farmers have railed against regulation, climate action, high costs and dwindling margins. *** Is any country not at war with its farmers? Denmark is the only country in the world that has pursued a relatively ambitious environmental policy while achieving some level of political consensus. This week, it implemented the world\u2019s first tax on agricultural emissions (including, yes, livestock flatulence). From 2030, farmers will have to pay a levy of 300 kroner (\u00a334) per tonne of methane \u2013 by 2035 this will rise to 750 kroner. \u201cYou can just imagine the \u2018They\u2019re taxing your burger\u2019 headlines if this were introduced in the US, the UK or Germany,\u201d Ajit says. *** The far right As with almost any other divisive issue these days, far-right agitators have of course appropriated the farming crisis as a wedge issue, constructing narratives deeply rooted in social grievance. \u201cPopulist and far-right parties find it very easy to exploit this tension \u2013 sometimes along really extreme Nazi era \u2018blood and soil\u2019 type rhetoric, sometimes in much more muted terms,\u201d Ajit says. The agricultural tensions have transcended European borders, becoming \u201crallying cries\u201d in the US and Canada, with far-right commentators weaponising European agricultural policy as a cautionary tale of governmental overreach. Alarmed by the electoral momentum of these fringe movements, centrist and centre-right political entities have responded not by addressing the systemic issues \u2013 which has in part caused the income gap between small and big farms to dramatically widen and led to thousands of small farms to shut down each year \u2013 but by strategically abandoning green policy initiatives. \u201cThere still needs to be a societal conversation about how we reimagine what farming will be like in the future,\u201d Ajit says.

Jacinta Allan announced the new project in Horsham, in Victoria\u2019s west, which is the second investment made by the government-owned State Electricity Commission. The project \u2013 dubbed the SEC Renewable Energy Park \u2013 will include a 119-megawatt (MW) solar facility and a 100MW two-hour battery, which will be built near the Horsham substation and existing transmission line. The project, initially known as the Horsham Solar Farm, had been \u201cwon\u201d at a Victorian government renewable energy auction in 2022, but was yet to be built when the SEC took it over the contract. The government has added the battery component to the scope of the project, which it said would enable the farm to store power until it\u2019s ready to be fed into the grid during periods of high demand. On Wednesday, Allan said the project was expected to generate 242,000MW hours of renewable energy a year once complete in 2027.

She said $42,000 a year would be spent in the local area during the project\u2019s construction, and a further $70,000 every year once the project is operational. Labor had pledged to revitalise the SEC, which had been the sole agency for electricity generation, transmission, distribution and supply, before it was privatised in the 1990s.

Here\u2019s a wrap of the main stories: Australia\u2019s ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, says Australia is \u201cready\u201d for a second Trump presidency and he will work closely with the incoming administration; Opposition leader Peter Dutton\u2019s position on international student caps is \u201cutterly reckless\u201d, the skills and training minister, Andrew Giles, says; The Victorian government announces it will spend $370m to build a massive solar farm and battery in Horsham, which will be able to power more than 50,000 homes and be wholly state-owned; Sydney trains will run on Thursday after a small concession from the rail union to delay strike action until Friday; Crossbench senators are attempting to suspend standing orders in the upper house to force the Albanese government to better resource the procedure office, which helps parliamentarians with drafting legislation and amendments; Australia\u2019s $50m Cop29 pledge is \u201cnowhere near our fair share\u201d, Greens senator says; and The share market has snapped its four-day winning streak, retreating from the previous day\u2019s all-time high amid geopolitical jitters after Ukraine fired American-made ballistic missiles into Russia for the first time. We will be back here with more news tomorrow. Visa applications plunge in first quarter of 2024-2025 Visa applications have dropped by 28% for the first quarter of 2024-2025 compared with the same period in 2018-2019, the Department of Home Affairs has revealed, indicating current measures to reduce international student intake is working. An update on the federal government\u2019s evidence level requirements released on Wednesday suggested there were \u201cencouraging signs\u201d in some offshore markets that the \u201cquality\u201d of foreign student visa applications had been improving, while refusal rates had also increased due to integrity measures to weed out non-genuine students. From today, student and provider risk ratings have been re-revalued under Ministerial Direction 107 to reward higher education institutions that showed improved performance in recruitment. As part of the rating, students from India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Columbia, Mongolia and Thailand are considered the highest risk (level 3), while Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Fiji are at a level 2. Universities have bemoaned the continuation of Ministerial Direction 107, introduced in December last year as a de facto cap to reduce visa approvals among high-risk universities. The vice-chancellor of La Trobe University, Prof Theo Farrell, released a statement earlier today expressing his \u201cdeep disappointment\u201d by the failure of the Senate to pass legislation for international student caps, which was to replace the directive. Ministerial Direction 107 is a blunt and opaque instrument that has caused financial havoc \u2026 it has led to a handful of very large metropolitan universities becoming even larger \u2026 At the same time, many smaller universities, mostly in outer metro and regional areas, have suffered catastrophic losses in student numbers. Aussie shares dip from peak as Ukraine strikes Russia The share market has snapped its four-day winning streak, retreating from the previous day\u2019s all-time high amid geopolitical jitters after Ukraine fired American-made ballistic missiles into Russia for the first time, AAP report. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index on Wednesday finished down 47.7 points, or 0.57%, to 8,326.3, while the broader All Ordinaries dropped 50.1 points, or 0.58%, to 8,579.1. In currency, the Australian dollar was at an eight-day high against its US counterpart, buying US65.26c, from US65.08c at Tuesday\u2019s ASX close. Family of Melbourne teenager fighting for life after feared methanol poisoning hopes for answers The family of one of two teenagers fighting for life in hospital after a suspected methanol poisoning incident in Laos hope authorities work out exactly what happened \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Melbourne friends Bianca Jones and Holly Bowles, both aged 19, had been staying at a hostel in Vang Vieng, north of the Laos capital, Vientiane, when they fell critically ill last week. They have since been hospitalised in Thailand, where their families have flown to be at their bedsides. You can read more on that story here: Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, I\u2019ll hand over to Nino Bucci to take you through the rest of our coverage this evening. Take care, and I\u2019ll see you bright and early tomorrow. David Coleman says Coalition wants social media ban passed by end of year The shadow communications minister, David Coleman, has also been up on the ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing this afternoon, asked about the social media ban for under-16s \u2013 likely to be put before parliament tomorrow. Coleman said the Coalition would \u201cwork structurally with the government\u201d and that he wants the bill to be passed by the end of the year. We will work constructively with the government and we will await the legislation when it is published tomorrow, but we want to get this done. Rio to take full control of uranium mine near Kakadu Mining giant Rio Tinto will shut down and rehabilitate a controversial uranium mine surrounded by the World Heritage Kakadu national park, AAP reports. Rio has announced it would compulsorily acquire the remaining shares it does not own in Energy Resources of Australia (ERA). The purchase will give it full control of the Ranger uranium mine, where rehabilitation activities have already started, and the nearby Jabiluka deposit in the Northern Territory, about 300km east of Darwin. The Rio Tinto chief executive of Australia, Kellie Parker, said the company would rehabilitate the Ranger Project Area to a standard that would establish an environment similar to Kakadu. She told the Australian Stock Exchange today: Our utmost priority and commitment is to complete this important rehabilitation project in a way that is consistent with the wishes of the Mirarr People. Proceeding with compulsory acquisition after participating for our full entitlement in the ERA capital raising underlines our commitment to Ranger\u2019s rehabilitation. Rio said it did not intend to mine or develop the Jabiluka uranium deposit if its compulsory acquisition was completed. The skills and training minister, Andrew Giles, is speaking with the ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing program about the legislation the government is attempting to pass during these last two sitting weeks. On the international student caps, he is asked what the next move is for the government, after the Coalition said it wouldn\u2019t support the legislation? He responded: Peter Dutton has got to really offer a better and more convincing explanation of his position. It is utterly reckless and inconsistent with everything he has said. The best solution is that which is on the table. The best solution is the legislation that we have proposed and I am yet to hear a persuasive argument against it. Asked if he thinks there is a link between international student numbers and housing prices, Giles responded there was a \u201crelatively small one\u201d. Man dies after falling from electric skateboard in NSW A man has died after falling from an electric skateboard on the New South Wales Central Coast. The man reportedly fell about 6pm on Sunday near Umina Beach. Police said the 45-year-old was treated at the scene by paramedics before being airlifted to Royal North Shore hospital in a critical condition, where he later died. A report will be prepared for the coroner, police said, and anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. South Australia\u2019s DV crisis line received record number of calls the day royal commission began work South Australia\u2019s domestic violence crisis line received a record number of calls on 1 July \u2013 the same day the royal commission into domestic, family and sexual violence began its work. As AAP reports, the Women\u2019s Safety Services SA chief executive, Maria Hagias, told the commission\u2019s first day of public hearings the system is in crisis because it doesn\u2019t have the resources to handle the significant increase in demand. The state domestic violence hotline received a record number of calls on the day the commission started its work, and expected to receive 35,000 calls for 2024. Hagias said: We can only answer 70% of those calls \u2026 this is an extreme challenge and it takes a lot of courage for people to call in. When you can\u2019t pick up that phone to support that person at that time, there are extreme frustrations, not only from people who are trying to call in, but also external stakeholders because they can\u2019t get through. That puts significant stress also on our frontline staff \u2026 and when you can\u2019t reach every person that calls, it is extremely distressing. Of the 70% of answered calls, another 55,000 calls are then made to support families. The demand is significant, and the system isn\u2019t coping, and it\u2019s at crisis point. Lifeline: 13 11 14 And with that, question time has wrapped up. The Liberal National party MP Garth Hamilton has got up and asked another question on \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 nuclear energy. The acting PM, Richard Marles, said he was happy to stay on this topic \u201call day and every day between now and the next election\u201d. The Australian people understand that, as the leader of the opposition pursues this ridiculous policy, that the only people who will end up paying for it is them. Every step that we take is going to be about putting downward pressure on the costs that they experience, which is so very, very different to what this leader of the opposition represents \u2026 what this leader of the opposition represents is a material and present risk to the household budget of every single Australian. Rowland says social media ban will contain \u2018robust\u2019 privacy provisions Rebekha Sharkie from the Centre Alliance party has asked about the government\u2019s plan to ban social media for under 16s \u2013 specifically, how age verification will be obtained. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, acknowledged that the policy is \u201ccontentious\u201d and \u201cone that has not actually been implemented at scale anywhere in the world\u201d. The legislation that we will bring to this parliament will contain robust provisions as they pertain to privacy \u2026 this is precisely why we are undertaking the age assurance trial, which we funded in the budget. We will use this time during the age assurance trial, and I would point out that the legislation will contain a one-year implementation timeframe to ensure that these matters are of concern are ones that are properly examined and properly accounted for. I do want to make this message clear to the Australian people: this is not about government mandating any form of technology or demanding any personal information be handed over to social media companies. Coalition persists with questions on nuclear The deputy opposition leader, Sussan Ley, has asked the acting PM about a report from the US claiming a renewables-plus-nuclear electricity grid is cheaper than a renewables-only grid \u2013 because clearly, we were due for another question on nuclear. Responding to this, Richard Marles said the report would be \u201cassessing an economy which already has a civil nuclear industry in place [and] where costs have already been put in place literally decades ago\u201d. This seems to be the fact that has completely escaped those opposite, that in order for us to get to a point of having a civil nuclear industry, we would need to go through the process of establishing it \u2013 which is deeply costly. [It won\u2019t be] the same as the calculation which exists in the United States or the United Kingdom or France, where they \u2026 have a civil nuclear industry already established, and those costs have already been sunk and are not priced into the future. But the reality of what we face is you can\u2019t go out there and just magic the reactors, you\u2019ve actually got to go and build them [and] that costs money, and the people who will pay for it are the Australian public. Infrastructure minister answers question on Middle Arm industrial project in Darwin Greens MP Elizabeth Watson-Brown has asked whether the government would redirect costs for the Middle Arm hub to support clean energy projects instead. The infrastructure minister, Catherine King, said the government remains committed to Middle Arm and said: Let me just remind the House that this is an equity injection. It is not money that then can be transferred to other projects \u2026 The Australian government remains committed to Middle Arm, there are a number of processes that have to be gone through, through the environmental processes, through planning processes, as well, through Infrastructure Australia, and all of those are under way at the moment. But again, I say to the Greens, stop using politics constantly in these sorts of debates, stop using politics, because we know that Middle Arm actually does support renewable energy \u2026 and it also makes sure that we have a strong economic future for the Northern Territory. Nationals MP asks where is the housing for new immigrants Nationals MP Anne Webster has asked about housing and immigration. She claims that a new person is arriving to live in Australia every 44 seconds \u2013 where are these people meant to live? The housing minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, responded that migration is \u201ccoming down because of changes that have been made by our government\u201d and \u201cif there is a single person in this parliament who is responsible for [the] broken [housing] system, he sits over there in the opposition leader\u2019s chair\u201d. She said the government arrived to office and found housing \u201cin an absolute mess\u201d, and said when the opposition was in government \u201cthey didn\u2019t even have a commonwealth housing minister.\u201d O\u2019Neil took aim at the Liberals and Greens for not support its housing policies, and said: Now if only, Speaker, we had a parliament that actually wanted to work with us on this issue that affects millions of people \u2026 What we have is an opposition that knows only one word \u2013 no, no, no \u2013 to every single proposition that\u2019s put forward. [The] Greens \u2026 talk a big game about housing, but when it comes time to make real change for real people, they say no too. So who would have thought the far left and the far right had so much in common in this country. Despite that opposition, we will work hard to make sure that we meet the housing needs of people in this country Marles says supporting a civil nuclear industry \u2018makes no financial sense whatsoever\u2019 The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, has asked another question about \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 nuclear energy. He asked whether the government\u2019s opposition to nuclear \u201chas nothing to do with cost or time, but because of their political battle with the Greens in inner-city seats\u201d? Richard Marles replied that \u201cwe do have a battle with the Greens political party, and we join that battle with relish\u201d. Which really does stand in stark contrast to what we see from those opposite who, when it comes to housing, the environment or now immigration, are in the greatest love affair of all time with the Greens political party. I mean, I think Romeo and Juliet teaches us that love conquers all. But I definitely do not think that Shakespeare [could] imagine what was going on here. What we are seeing here is the most unholy alliance between the Greens and the Liberals. Marles echoed earlier comments, and said \u201cthe simple reason why we are not supporting a civil nuclear industry, it\u2019s because it makes no financial sense whatsoever\u201d. Marles on \u2018crystal-clear articulation\u2019 of Coalition philosophy While taking a dixer, Richard Marles pointed to some comments from the deputy opposition leader Sussan Ley yesterday in parliament, that \u201cif you don\u2019t pay for something, you don\u2019t value it\u201d \u2013 in reference to fee-free Tafe. You can read more on this in yesterday\u2019s blog here. He said it gave \u201ca crystal clear articulation of the philosophies of those opposite\u201d, and said: This was exactly demonstrated when the leader of the opposition was the minister for health, when he tried to introduce a GP tax, when he tried to put a cost on the attendance at emergency departments right around the country, when he sought to increase the prices of basic medicines. And what he did as the minister for health, if given the chance, he would do as the prime minister across the board. Well, Mr Speaker, on this side of the house, we have a very different philosophy \u2026 Marles is asked again about civil nuclear industry Nationals MP Kevin Hogan has asked the acting prime minister whether the government signed an agreement under the Indo-Pacific economic framework that includes a cooperative work program to support the uptake of small modular nuclear reactors? Richard Marles said the opposition \u201ccrawl[s] to this topic through every different alleyway\u201d, and repeated: But let me be really clear, what I can absolutely confirm is that this government is not going to be pursuing a civil nuclear industry \u2026 Kylea Tink asks about use of public money to pay interest on political party loans Independent MP Kylea Tink has asked the treasurer how the government can justify allowing public money to be used to pay the interest on political party loans, while ordinary Australians are struggling? The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said minister Don Farrell \u201chas been working for some time in a consultative way to do what we can to make sure that our donations regime is as transparent as possible, and that we take responsible and necessary steps to lessen the impact of big money on politics.\u201d He urged the parliament to support the government\u2019s measures \u2013 meaning the electoral reform legislation. In a question time where the opposition seemed set to put more focus on to nuclear energy, shadow energy minister Ted O\u2019Brien has gotten himself kicked out quite quickly, after a strange interjection. Asking acting PM Richard Marles about \u201cglobal momentum for nuclear energy\u201d, and his claim that the government \u201cremain stubbornly in opposition of this proven energy resource\u201d, O\u2019Brien took his seat. \u201cThe answer is \u2013 it\u2019s all about cost and it\u2019s all about economics. We don\u2019t have a civil nuclear industry in Australia today. It is a significant fact, an inconvenient truth,\u201d Marles started to respond \u2013 before O\u2019Brien made a noisy shouted interjection. Marles called it a \u201cridiculous display\u201d. O\u2019Brien was ejected by speaker Milton Dick under standing order 94a. Richard Marles criticises \u2018ridiculous\u2019 Coalition nuclear policy After Labor\u2019s Catherine King took a dixer on policies to address the gender pay gap, shadow climate and energy minister Ted O\u2019Brien asked why the government remains opposed to exploring nuclear as an option. The acting prime minister, Richard Marles, said it comes down to cost. He began giving an answer but had to stop twice due to interjections, and O\u2019Brien was sent out under 94a. Marles got up for a third time, and answered: It is a ridiculous policy that has been put forward by those opposite, and it simply fails to ignore the convenient truth for those opposite \u2013 that we don\u2019t have a civil nuclear industry in Australia today and to establish one from scratch, costs money, and takes time. It\u2019s not that simple, although the leader of the opposition may think it\u2019s that simple, because he thinks that the way it works is that you go up and burn uranium, that we go out the back, set up a bonfire, throw some uranium on it, and bingo, there\u2019s renewable energy. But unfortunately, that\u2019s not how it actually works. He said the government\u2019s renewables policy \u201cstands in stark contrast to the ridiculous antics that we see from those opposite.\u201d The opposition leader Peter Dutton has opened question time with a question to Richard Marles, again asking why Australia didn\u2019t sign up to a civil nuclear deal signed by the US and UK. Marles answered questions about this yesterday, and the UK government admitted Australia was mistakenly included on a list of countries expected to sign up to the deal: Marles responded that \u201cthere\u2019s a very similar simple answer to that question \u2013 because we don\u2019t have a civil nuclear energy country, and nor do we seek to establish one.\u201d We don\u2019t seek to go down that path, so we are not a part of that agreement. And if we did go down that path, as the leader of the opposition is suggesting, there would be no prospect of any piece of electricity entering into the grid for two decades. Just minutes into Question Time, before Marles even gave his answer, Spence MP Matt Burnell was sent out under 94a for interjecting. Question Time will begin in about five minutes\u2019 time. Grab a coffee and stay tuned, we\u2019ll bring you the latest here in a moment. Shadow treasurer replies to Chalmers\u2019 statement on the economy Earlier, the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, delivered a reply to treasurer Jim Chalmers\u2019 statement on the economy (which you can read about earlier in the blog, here and here). He argued the government, in its nearly three years in office, has \u201cmade bad decisions and had the wrong priorities\u201d \u2013 pointing to the money spent on the voice referendum and \u201cthree expansionary budgets that have kept inflation higher for longer\u201d. He outlined the economic approach the Coalition would take if elected to government, and said: We will get our economy back to basics \u2013 fighting high prices and interest rates first, winding back regulatory roadblocks, boosting productivity and delivering lower, simpler and fairer taxes. We will also stand up for consumers, small businesses and farmers by delivering stronger penalties for anti-competitive behaviour in the supermarket and hardware sectors. We will support Australians to build businesses, not bureaucracies. We will ensure that Australians have more affordable and reliable energy by rejecting the government\u2019s reckless renewables-only approach. We will restore the dream of home ownership and unlock up to 500,000 homes by investing in shovel-ready infrastructure that will enable homes to be delivered faster. We will reduce migration and place a two-year ban on foreign investors buying existing homes. We will tackle union corruption that is continuing to drive up building costs. And, we will take action to make our communities safer, including online. Aemo confident power strains can be managed next week as heatwave sweeps east As noted in earlier posts, we\u2019ve got the combination of warm weather lapping across most of Australia\u2019s population centres over the next few days. The Australian Energy Market Operator has issued updated lack of reserve level 3 alerts for Tuesday evening in New South Wales, seeking extra generation (latest alert has the potential \u201cinterrupted\u201d supply at 142 megawatts). To stress: the alerts are intended to prompt a market response and aren\u2019t a prediction of blackouts. Aemo also indicates that one issue was a transmission one \u2013 and the resolution of that should ease the grid strain. In the meantime, AGL Energy has provided an update on what\u2019s happening to its Bayswater coal-fired power plant in the NSW Hunter Valley. It\u2019s a big one, with about 2715MW capacity when all four units are online. However, unit 2 is offline until early December (circa the 6th) for planned maintenance. Its unit 1 is working fine and its unit 4 is expected to return to full operation this evening. Unit 3, though, is the one that lately dropped out of service for unscheduled \u201ctube leak repair\u201d work, an AGL spokesperson tells us. It\u2019s expected to be back within 14 days if not sooner. Nick Bryant: \u2018It almost seems like Australia has lost the ability to do big things\u2019 Wrapping up his appearance at the NPC, Nick Bryant argued that it \u201chasn\u2019t been a great century for Australia\u201d when asked about an increasing focus on leaders, rather than policy issues, in the country. Bryant said the century started great for Australia with the Sydney Olympics, but \u201cit hasn\u2019t been a brilliant 23 years since.\u201d You have had this churn of prime ministers, a politics that is incredibly destructive and personalised and it almost seems like Australia has lost the ability to do big things any more. The reform era was always based on big things. The reform era has sadly been replaced by a revenge era and a retribution era. It\u2019s trying to get back to the reform era, big ideas rather than small-target politics. An optimism, which strikes me as the greatest natural characteristic that Australia has \u2013 there is a reason why the cameramen of the BBC are Australians \u2013 because they are optimistic and they always think they can do stuff. I don\u2019t see that as much in modern Australia as when I first came here. Former BBC foreign correspondent Nick Bryant on right approach to Trump: \u2018Don\u2019t be bullied\u2019 At the National Press Club today, former BBC foreign correspondent Nick Bryant has been speaking and taking questions from the crowd. He was asked to weigh in on Kevin Rudd\u2019s role as ambassador to the US, and said Australia should stand by him: You cannot let America have a veto over your diplomatic appointments. The other point is, you cannot show weakness at the start of a new Trump era, right? I watch many international leaders deal with Donald Trump and they adopted a swathe of different approaches. Shinzo Abe tried to befriend him on the golf course \u2026 but Trump was still hostile against Japan. [Emmanuel] Macron did a faux friendship thing \u2026 Malcolm Turnbull had the right approach. Don\u2019t be bullied \u2026 That is the approach to adopt with Trump, don\u2019t concede ground. Watch: Kevin Rudd says he\u2019s ready to work with incoming Trump administration Earlier, we brought you comments from ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, saying he is ready to work closely with the incoming Trump administration. Here is a video of the full comments he made via video link this morning, to the Sydney International Strategy Forum: Just following on from our last post: Brain Tumour Alliance Australia says it uses shoes to get its message across, because shoes \u201cclearly visualise that brain tumours affect everybody regardless of age, gender or background and provide a powerful and impactful message to parliamentarians and to society.\u201d A Parliament House courtyard has been filled with the shoes of people affected by brain tumours, as part of an annual \u201chead to the hill\u201d event. Brain Tumour Alliance Australia hosts the awareness event each year to advocate to government, saying that brain tumour research remains significantly underfunded compared with other cancers. Mike Bowers snapped these photos from the event earlier: Victorian renewable energy park to be completed by 2027, Jacinta Allan says Dubbed the SEC Renewable Energy Park, premier Jacinta Allan said the project will be capable of generating around 242,000 megawatt hours of renewable energy a year, or enough to power 51,000 homes. It will consist of 119-megawatt solar farm and 100-megawatt two-hour batteries, which will be developed by Swedish company OX2. Allan said the local community will also directly benefit from the profits from the projects, via a fund to be set up by the SEC. She said $42,000 a year will be spent in the local area during the project\u2019s construction and a further $70,000 every year once the project is operational. It is expected to be complete by 2027 and will provide electricity to Victorian government schools, hospitals and offices. The Victorian government has announced it will spend $370m to build a massive solar farm and battery in Horsham, which will be able to power more than 50,000 homes and be wholly state-owned. The premier, Jacinta Allan, visited the city in Victoria\u2019s west to announce the solar farm today as the second investment of the state\u2019s State Electricity Commission. At the 2022 state election, the Labor government committed to reviving the SEC, which for decades was the sole agency in the state for electricity generation, transmission, distribution and supply before it was privatised in the 1990s. Allan said the solar farm would be the first 100% government-owned energy generation project since the commission was privatised in the 1990s. International student cap would lead to rents falling by just $5 a week in metro areas, report says International students are being scapegoated by both major parties as responsible for the housing crisis without evidence, the Student Accommodation Council has warned. A report released by the council last week found international students made up just 6% of the rental market and had a minimal presence in areas popular with families. It suggested capping international students at 270,000 per year, as Labor has lobbied for, would reduce their rental share by less than 1% \u2013 leading to lowered rents of just $5 a week for metropolitan areas. This week, the Coalition announced it would not support Labor\u2019s cap on foreign students, with Peter Dutton maintaining yesterday \u201cthere is accommodation being taken up at the moment by international students that I believe very strongly should be occupied by Australian citizens\u201d. The minister for home affairs, Tony Burke, pushed Dutton on his stance during Question Time, stating: If anybody is thinking because of the rate of immigration, they are having trouble getting into a home, just know the leader of the opposition has decided to make that worse. Student Accommodation Council executive director, Torie Brown, said while politicians were quick to blame international students for the housing crisis, it didn\u2019t \u201creflect reality\u201d. We need to address decades of structural failures across our housing markets and not unfairly pin the blame on a single group. International students only make up six per cent of the rental market \u2013 heavily weighted towards CBDs \u2013 with 73% of local government areas having an international student concentration of less than 1%.\u201d Sydney train strike: all you need to know For all the Sydneysiders following along with today\u2019s blog: here is everything you need to know about the train shutdown this weekend, with this explainer from Luca Ittimani: More on Jim Chalmers\u2019 second ministerial statement on the economy Continued from the previous post: The Reserve Bank, though, has headline CPI rising by the middle of next year because they have to assume energy and other rebates expire \u2013 until the actual policy changes. As we have said often, it\u2019s hard to believe pre-election campaign promises from both major parties won\u2019t promise sizable \u201ccost of living relief\u201d. As for growth, Chalmers says: Treasury is expecting a gradual recovery in the economy driven by rising real incomes thanks to our cost-of-living relief, jobs growth and progress bringing inflation down. What we won\u2019t see is a third consecutive budget surplus. That\u2019s because government spending is rising but also because Australia\u2019s exports of dirt (often red, as in iron ore, or black rock, with coal) won\u2019t be delivering the budget upgrades of yore. In fact, iron ore prices are down 30% or more so far in 2024. But at about US$100 a tonne (as it was this morning), the commodity is still well above the conservative US$60/t average used by Treasury in its budget forecasts. So it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll get some revenue upgrades \u2013 unless China\u2019s economy hits the proverbial wall \u2013 in the current budget. Just not as large as in previous budgets. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is giving his second ministerial statement on the economy from noon, and it offers a \u201cstocktake\u201d on global and domestic conditions \u2013 and a bit of sneak peek at next month\u2019s Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (Myefo). As you might expect, it\u2019s a generally upbeat speech, listing \u201csignificant progress\u201d in fighting inflation, repairing the budget (and a few reforms) while Chalmers remains \u201coptimistic\u201d about the future. There\u2019s not a lot of hard new numbers, though, it may be the first outing I\u2019ve seen of a \u201c1,000 jobs a day\u201d created since the Albanese government took power 30 months ago. (We\u2019ve known about the million jobs \u2026 though they may downplay that bit because we might yet get a few months of job cuts before they go to the polls.) Anyway, the inflation outlook will be largely in line with the May budget forecasts (with headline CPI falling to 2.75% by next June, and remaining there until the following June, before ebbing further in subsequent years to 2.5%). Canavan says Dutton did not ask for abortion bill to be removed Matt Canavan continued, from the previous post: I have this very simple, shared with Senator [Alex] Antic, very simple position on these issues, that any human being, no matter what their age, no matter what their state of health in this country, deserves to have care. That is all my bill does. Doesn\u2019t change abortion procedure. Doesn\u2019t restrict abortion procedures. It simply says that everybody, every Australian, deserves to have medical care appropriate to their circumstances. I will always defend that. Asked if Peter Dutton had asked them to remove the bill, Canavan said: \u201cNo one has done that.\u201d We\u2019ve got a great tradition in our party of respecting each other\u2019s views. I do respect other views on this, but I would never seek to remove a Greens bill that took an opposite position than me on these issues. I have no problem debating my position but obviously the Greens are scared of a discussion. The Nationals senator Matt Canavan says he won\u2019t back down after the Greens sought to remove his abortion-related bill from the Senate notice paper, accusing the minor party of seeking to \u201csilence debate\u201d. Canavan, the maverick Queenslander, said the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has also not asked him or fellow co-sponsor, Alex Antic, to remove their \u201cchildren born alive\u201d bill from the Senate. Guardian Australia\u2019s Karen Middleton reported overnight that the Greens senator Larissa Waters was seeking to have the Human Rights (Children Born Alive Protection) Bill discharged from the notice paper, where it has sat \u2013 without debate \u2013 for some time. Dutton told Coalition MPs in a party room address two weeks ago that they should avoid public debate about abortion, with concern the issue may have cost them seats at the Queensland state election. Asked about Waters\u2019 push and the status of his bill, Canavan said: \u201cThe status of it is it\u2019s on the notice paper.\u201d This is an attempt to censor and silence debate \u2026 but obviously I do actually welcome the opportunity that Senator Waters has given me to state again that there are around two babies a week in this country born alive following a termination procedure. Canavan was at a press conference with Antic and the American free speech campaigner Michael Shellenberger, discussing the government\u2019s misinformation bill \u2013 which is in danger of going down in flames, with little support on the Senate crossbench thus far. Coalition bill on McPhillamys goldmine rejected by Senate The Coalition is livid that its bill on the McPhillamys goldmine was rejected by the Senate this morning, with Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price accusing the Labor government of seeking \u201cto keep Indigenous Australians disadvantaged in order to better control them\u201d. Now to recap, this is the proposed goldmine at Blayney, in central west NSW, which was put in jeopardy after a decision by the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, to prevent a tailings or run-off dam being built in one part of the project. It came after a Wiradjuri elder lodged an application to protect Aboriginal heritage from being destroyed. The Coalition has been continually outraged over the decision, citing a combination of local economic benefits and criticism of how the environmental consultation process was carried out, including concerns raised by other local local Aboriginal land council groups. The Coalition had put up a Senate bill which sought to prevent \u201cthe minister from making a declaration that would affect the construction or operation of a goldmine in the Blayney goldmine area.\u201d But it was quashed at the second reading stage of debate, negatived 24-27 in a Senate vote today. Shadow ministers Jonno Duniam, Susan McDonald and Price gave a press conference shortly afterward, again criticising the original decision and how Plibersek came to it. McDonald claimed the government wasn\u2019t doing enough to support mining, but Price \u2013 the shadow Indigenous Australians minister \u2013 raised concerns about the loss of income for local Aboriginal people. She said: They\u2019re not doing anything to benefit Indigenous people in this country, and so in this situation, it\u2019s whole communities that are missing out. This government is completely against ensuring that Indigenous Australians can benefit in any economic way going forward. But that\u2019s not surprising to Labor, because Labor like to keep Indigenous Australians disadvantaged in order to better control them, in order to gain power and keep the little people down. I mean, why would they? Why would they allow for a development like this to take place, which would mean opportunity, which would mean jobs for the Indigenous community in the area, and more broadly, the wider community. Government\u2019s spending and donation cap bill receives second reading The government\u2019s controversial spending and donation cap bill has just received a second reading in the House of Representatives. The independent MP Kate Chaney is moving amendments that remove provisions on spending caps and increased public and administrative funding. Chaney says these are the \u201cmost offensive parts\u201d of the bill. She says: The way this legislation is drafted, any ads that are not for the individual but for a party are not counted within the [$800K] divisional cap, so a party incumbent could outspend a challenger many times over \u2026 This is not a level playing field. Chaney argues that in a \u201ccost-of-living crisis\u201d the government should not be increasing public funding of elections by $40m: Parties are able to make a profit in unwinnable seats and shift that money to where they are being challenged \u2026 It gives them a war chest to fight any new challengers. It\u2019s fine for me \u2013 I\u2019m an incumbent. But it\u2019s not fine for anyone new, who thinks we need new ideas and new ways of being represented in our politics. This reduces competition, and it\u2019s not on. The independent MP Kylea Tink is now speaking in support of the amendments. \u2018Wave of heat\u2019 to elevate fire risks and electricity demand, meteorologists say We\u2019re not officially in summer for another week and a half but for many in Australia\u2019s south-east, it will certainly feel like it in the coming days. Dean Narramore, a senior forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology, says day- and night-time temperatures will be as much as 8-14C warmer than usual for this time of year: We\u2019re going to see the heat really start increasing across South Australia tomorrow, and then continue building there and into Tasmania, Victoria and southern New South Wales Friday and through the weekend. Some areas will endure a low-intensity heatwave although pockets can also expect severe conditions. As mentioned in our earlier post, the tail end of the warmth \u2013 what the Weatherzone senior meteorologist Ben Domensino dubbed a \u201cwave of heat\u201d \u2013 will also push up electricity demand. Domensino said: It\u2019s probably the warmest burst of heat that we\u2019ve had [so far this warming season], because the dew-point temperatures will be increasing as well. There\u2019s a bit of moisture in the atmosphere, which will make it feel quite muggy with this hot weather. It\u2019ll feel quite warm. Air-conditioning demand will likely be high. Relatively light winds will also mean there probably won\u2019t be a lot of windfarm electricity generation, Domensino said. The lack of wind, though, will also mean fire danger levels \u2013 apart from the Eyre Peninsula and some other parts of South Australia \u2013 won\u2019t be quite as elevated as they might otherwise have been. Chalmers outlines plan to encourage more women to study economics Last night the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, addressed the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia, revealing a plan to encourage more women to study economics and take up economic leadership roles. Chalmers said he has put on the agenda for the next meeting of state and territory treasurers next week: Exploring ways we can work together to lift barriers to the study of economics. The role treasuries can play, as stewards of the discipline, in making the profession more inclusive. How we can bring a broader range of views and perspectives into future public policy and advice. How we increase the number of women in economic leadership positions at all levels of government, including by exploring more robust and regular reporting. Chalmers also discussed some of the causes of alienation in politics: But underpinning, if not undermining, all of our efforts across all of these policy areas is the sense laid bare in the final report of the Covid review that there has been an erosion of trust in institutions, like governments. As Mark Butler said when we released that Covid report, it is going to be a long, hard road to get trust to the level it was before the pandemic. It\u2019s easily lost and hard to build it back up \u2026 The loss of trust is not just from Covid, though, that\u2019s just one of three shocks in 15 years \u2013 The GFC before it and an inflation spike exacerbated by two wars \u2013 Which have created economic and social undercurrents that revealed themselves around the world over this longer period, and not just recent weeks in US politics. These undercurrents have created a sense of alienation. Earlier this morning, some parliamentarians in Canberra attended the lighting of the giving tree in the marble foyer of Parliament House. Each year, Parliament House raises money for two charities through the giving tree. The president of the Senate, Sue Lines, and the speaker, Milton Dick, switched on the lights and announced the 2024 charities just earlier. And Mike Bowers was there to capture all the action: Leading economic indicator reports strongest result since July 2022 We\u2019ve noted in a couple of places (such as here) that the worst of the economic slowdown is probably behind us (unless there is some nasty surprise looming). The solid labour market, tax cuts that are flowing and easing inflation suggest things are starting to look up. (Corporate failures, a lagging indicator, might have a way to rise further, though.) The Leading Index published by Westpac and the Melbourne Institute adds to the signs of a possible upturn gaining momentum. The index moved firmly into positive territory last month (going from -0.2% in September to +0.26%), and is now at its highest level since July 2022\u2019s 0.63% reading. Back in mid-2022, the burst of economic activity after Covid-19 was fully under way, Ryan Wells, a Westpac economist, said. The index\u2019s return to positive territory was \u201cbroadly consistent with Westpac\u2019s view that the pace of [annual] economic growth, having hit a nadir of 1.0% in the middle of the year, is set to pick up pace, reaching 1.5% by year-end and 2.4% by the end of 2025\u201d, Wells said. Not quite economic nirvana, mind, but something of a soft landing particularly if the Reserve Bank starts to cut interest rates from early 2025 (as Westpac predicts for February). Of course, if the leading index keeps rising, the RBA might think it\u2019s too early to cut. Anyway, it all keeps a few pundits in business. 90% of industrial gas use can be electrified or regassed with green hydrogen: report Earlier today, the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union and Lock the Gate launched a report commissioned from Springmount Advisory called Turning Down the Gas, which found that at least 90% of industrial gas use can already be electrified or regassed with green hydrogen, and technology solutions are rapidly being developed for the remaining 10%. It found gas demand could decrease 216 petajoules by 2035, including by: Replacing gas use in manufacturing with electricity using technology that is commercially available today would reduce demand by 112PJ. Doing the same in commercial buildings would reduce gas demand by 25PJ. \u201cRegassing\u201d and substituting metals smelting and refining, iron and steel manufacturing, and chemical manufacturing with green hydrogen would cut gas use by 62PJ. If gas use were reduced by this much, wholesale gas expenses would be reduced by at least $2.5bn, and cutting greenhouse gas emissions by more than 11m tonnes each year. The national secretary of the AMWU, Steve Murphy, said: Australia must prioritise our finite and precious gas resources to support the industries that employ hundreds of thousands of highly skilled workers and that underpin every aspect of Australian life, from food production and health, to infrastructure and household goods. There is a clear national interest in ensuring that local manufacturing industries are supported and thrive as the world decarbonises. We commissioned this report because it is clear to us that the interests of gas companies are cutting across the interests of Australian workers, Australian industry, our rightful place as the leader in our region for a fair and just industrial transition. I\u2019m a firm believer that we can meet our commitments to climate action and create secure jobs in manufacturing if we make those two goals a national priority. Government senator says motion in Senate was about creating conflict Back in the Senate, the emergency management minister, Jenny McAllister, said she was disappointed crossbenchers chose to create conflict over discussion after being caught off-guard by a surprise suspension to the standing orders this morning. Those on the crossbench are frustrated with the amount of legislation the Labor government is attempting to push through the Senate this sitting fortnight. In particular, they\u2019re concerned the drafting office \u2013 which supports them with amendments \u2013 is overloaded and under-resourced. McAllister stood up to say the government would not support the motion, saying it was not the appropriate place to raise it. She said: The appropriate place to raise this is either through discussions, informally, or through referral to the appropriations committee, which is the entity which oversees the budget for the Senate. And it is disappointing that the matter is instead being raised in this way, without notice, without discussion, and suggests that the people who are seeking to resolve it are not, in fact, seeking to truly resolve it, but actually to escalate a conflict, where a better and effective way of doing it would be through conversation. As McAllister delivered her response, Jacqui Lambie can be heard on the parliamentary broadcast interjecting off-microphone. Ultimately, the motion passed but unless the government actually allocates extra resourcing, that\u2019s where it ends for now. But not before Lambie gets the last word: So for the last two years, we\u2019ve been telling you this is a problem. So to come in here and act like everything\u2019s all kosher and it\u2019s fine and that we haven\u2019t been doing anything for two years \u2013 now, I intend to come back in here tomorrow and do this again tomorrow morning, unless something is done today. Australia\u2019s ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, says Australia is \u201cready\u201d for a second Trump presidency. Rudd gave a speech to the Sydney International Strategy Forum this morning via video link, and said the embassy had been working over the course of the last year to \u201censure that we were well prepared for this moment\u201d \u2013 meaning the US election outcome. And the bottom line is, we\u2019re ready. The team here at the embassy and the government of Australia are ready to work closely with the new Trump administration to continue to realise the benefits of what is a very strong economic and security partnership. Rudd said that Australia\u2019s bilateral relationship with the US \u201chas never been more relevant, or more important\u201d, in this \u201cage of strategic competition\u201d. We live in a world of many challenges and we are clear that the region we want, the interests we have and the values we share require and call for our two nations to work together. And that is what we will continue to do with President Trump and his incoming administration. We here at the embassy in Washington look forward to contributing to that in the future. Rudd made headlines this month after deleting tweets he previously made about Trump, saying it did not reflect the views of the Australian government. Shortly afterwards, a senior Trump adviser reposted Rudd\u2019s congratulatory statement to Trump on social media with a gif of an hourglass. Back in the Senate, and Greens senator Larissa Waters has accused the Albanese government of trying to curb the power of the crossbench in the Senate by \u201cdiminishing\u201d their resourcing. Some of the independents banded together to suspend the standing orders to raise the resource issue within the drafting office, with senators warning the office couldn\u2019t cope with the workload. For non-government senators, the office helps draft its amendments to bills. Waters said: When the drafters say to us, \u2018look, we\u2019re really sorry, but we\u2019re slammed. There\u2019s not enough of us to do the work that you need us to do, because the government haven\u2019t [sic] given us the staff to do that work\u2019. It\u2019s not their fault. It\u2019s the fault of the government not hiring enough people to do the work to help the Greens and the crossbench fix the government\u2019s weak legislation. The ACT senator David Pocock added: When you cannot get amendments that are based on what you\u2019re hearing from experts \u2013 when they have concerns about a government bill, when you\u2019re hearing from people that you represent and you want to move amendments that reflect that, and you\u2019ve got a government that seems intent to drop hundreds of pages of legislation, forgo all parliamentary scrutiny and ram it through, and you cannot move amendments \u2013 this is not good for our democracy. The Liberals supported the suspension, so Lambie was able to move the motion. More than 100 Sydney train services cancelled or delayed yesterday amid industrial action Back at the press conference on Sydney Trains, a spokesperson said more than 100 train services were cancelled or delayed across Sydney yesterday. I know that created and continues to create inconvenience for passengers as they move around the network. Please be assured that our teams are doing their very best to keep the system running reliably. He said there were cancellations on the intercity line, particularly services coming in from Gosford and Newcastle, and buses were replacing the Blue Mountain services for three hours today as a result of industrial action. Our teams are doing their best and we ask passengers to please be respectful of our staff, they are doing everything they can to help passengers navigate the challenging period. Crossbench senators are attempting to suspend the standing orders in the upper house in order to force the Albanese government to better resource the procedure office, which helps parliamentarians with drafting legislation and amendments. The motion, moved by Jacqui Lambie and co-signed by David Pocock, Lidia Thorpe, Fatima Payman and Larissa Waters, calls on the government to urgently hire more legislative drafters in the Department of the Senate before any \u201cfurther controversial bills\u201d are brought forward. First up to speak is Lambie, who describes the under-resourcing as \u201cabsolutely disgraceful\u201d. We can\u2019t get our stuff drafted, and you\u2019re trying to throw through 20 bills in a fortnight? What is wrong with you? \u2026 The lack of resourcing is an absolute choke on democracy. The legislation that the government is trying to jam through is massive and has serious consequences. Other independent senators are getting up to speak. NSW transport minister addresses media amid strike affecting Sydney trains The NSW transport minister, Jo Haylen, has been speaking to reporters in Sydney after the announcement that Sydney trains will run tomorrow, after a small concession from the rail union to delay strike action until Friday. You can read more on this earlier in the blog, here. Speaking just now, Haylen said: The actions are still in place for Friday and Saturday, causing potential massive disruption to our network and meaning that people cannot get where they need to go. The only way to keep our network running and to make sure people can get where they need to go is for the union to withdraw their industrial actions that are currently in place for Friday and Saturday. That remains our ask of the unions. She said the government would continue to meet with union leadership, but her responsibility is to \u201cmake sure that we can keep the travelling public up-to-date\u201d. \u2026 to give them as much notice as possible and to do everything I can to minimise disruptions and keep our network running, while also continuing our negotiations and conversations with the unions to reach agreement. Instagram users will be able to refresh algorithm, Meta says Two days after a parliamentary committee recommended that users be able to have more control over their algorithm, Instagram has announced it will roll out a way for users to reset their algorithm that recommends content to them. In a blog post today, Instagram\u2019s parent company Meta said the new feature will be rolled out in the coming weeks, and allow people, with a few taps, to reset what Instagram shows them in explore, reels and their feed: Your recommendations will start to personalise again over time, showing new content based on the content and accounts you interact with. When resetting, you\u2019ll also have the option to review the accounts you\u2019re following and unfollow any that share content you no longer want to see. Resetting the algorithm was one of the key recommendations of the parliamentary committee examining social media\u2019s report, released on Monday. However, the recommendation went further including allowing users to opt out of the algorithm altogether. It\u2019s one of a number of moves Meta has made in recent months to respond to increased political scrutiny on the impact platforms are having on society, including recently the introduction of Instagram accounts for teens with more restrictions over who they can follow, who can message them and what they can see. The committee, notably, did not recommend banning under-16s from social media, which the government is planning to legislate, instead calling for a report on the outcome of a trial of age assurance technology to be provided to the parliament when it is completed in mid-2025. The law academic Anne Twomey has written a piece for Guardian Australia, arguing that aspects of Labor\u2019s electoral reforms are vulnerable to constitutional challenge. You can read her full piece below: Earlier this morning, we reported that Australia has pledged $50m towards a global loss and damage fund to help the world\u2019s most vulnerable people to repair the damage from climate breakdown, at the Cop29 summit. The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi says this funding is a start, but \u201cnowhere near the fair share for a country which is one of the largest exporters of coal and gas\u201d. This pledge risks becoming a token gesture if the Albanese government continues to approve new coal and gas mines that will keep exacerbating climate driven disasters which results in the loss and damage suffered by the Global South. The climate crisis is having a severe impact on Pacific nations who did nothing to create this disaster, yet bear the burden of the damage caused. Pacific nations need real and strong action from countries like Australia \u2013 that means ending new coal and gas, not pouring fuel on fire by opening the floodgates for fossil fuel projects. Anthony Albanese has met with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Brazil. During the leaders\u2019 opening remarks for their 10th meeting since May 2022, Anthony Albanese said India and Australia could build a \u201cstronger, safer and more prosperous future for citizens in both of our countries\u201d. The two discussed \u201cincreasing two-way trade, business engagements and market access for goods and services\u201d as well as security in the Indo-Pacific region. Albanese said the countries would renew their defence and security pact next year after it was first signed in 2009. While no specific threats or countries were mentioned by name in the official statement, both leaders touched on their mutual interest in maintaining regional security and stability. Modi said: Friends, we have been working together to promote peace, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific, and we will continue to do so. We have stressed on dialogue and diplomacy to solve global conflicts and tensions. Albanese said: Prime minister Modi and I have also committed to developing a joint maritime security collaboration roadmap, including to deepen maritime domain awareness. Australia\u2019s relationship with India is stronger, deeper and more consequential than ever before. Independent Tasmanian MP disappointed state government walking back plans for mandatory pre-commitment card The independent Tasmanian MP Meg Webb was on ABC RN earlier this morning, discussing the state government\u2019s decision to walk back plans for a mandatory pre-commitment card. Yesterday, Tasmanian parliament moved to debate a motion of no-confidence in the premier, Jeremy Rockliff, after the government failed to vote it down. Webb said she had suspected the government would walk away from the card, and \u201cunfortunately, yesterday, what came out was a firm indication that they are entirely abandoning \u2026 that card.\u201d They\u2019re not using that language. They\u2019re saying it\u2019s deferred indefinitely. But the reality is, if you\u2019re deferring something and then you\u2019re not continuing to work on it, you\u2019re actually abandoning it. Before working in parliament, Webb worked for Anglicare. She said it is \u201cinsidious\u201d the way poker machines are placed into local suburbs in Tasmania: We see that placed into our poorest suburbs where people are most vulnerable, because they\u2019re already under financial stress. They\u2019re most vulnerable to becoming addicted to these machines. They take millions and millions of dollars out of our poorest communities. And of course, it\u2019s not just the person who has developed a problem with their poker machine use losing all their money, it\u2019s actually having catastrophic losses, losing their housing. It also breaks up families. The impact flows out from that person. Albanese says Australian jobs were focus at G20 summit The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has shared some images from G20 to X and said the summit was \u201call about creating jobs in Australia.\u201d Inflation is a global problem, and it requires a global response. And Australia\u2019s relationships around the world matter. Here at this summit in Brazil, I\u2019ve been able to meet with leaders to work on solutions to our shared challenges. Addressing supply chain issues that have pushed up prices, global action on climate change, and the opportunities that clean energy provides to our economies were key points of discussion. Summits like the G20 are all about how we can make sure that everyone benefits from economic growth. By making Australia\u2019s voice heard, we can shape solutions that benefit Australians. Coalition nuclear costings to be released \u2018very soon\u2019, Littleproud says David Littleproud was pushed for when the Coalition will release the costings for its nuclear energy plan, and he responded: \u201cVery soon.\u201d We made it clear you will see it well before Christmas and well before the election. Nationals introduce bill to implement national standard for organic products The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, was also on ABC News Breakfast earlier this morning, when he spoke about the party\u2019s decision to introduce legislation ensuring organic products in the supermarket are actually organic. He claimed that imported products can have as little as 2% organic material, so \u201cAustralian consumers are being misled about the standards they are consuming\u201d. We\u2019ve taken the unprecedented step of introducing a bill ourselves to bring in a national standard for organics \u2026 We think farmers should be protected in knowing what is being imported. You can have confidence in Australian produce, but it will also give us the export advantage where it is costing our farmers hundreds of thousands of dollars individually each time they go to crack a new international market. Littleproud said he would have no issue with the government changing a couple of words and reintroducing it in their name if that\u2019s what is required to pass the changes, because \u201cthis is beyond politics\u201d. If the Albanese government won\u2019t do this, then we\u2019ve made it as a significant commitment that it will be one of the bills to be reintroduced under a Coalition government. The bill was introduced to parliament yesterday. The Australian Energy Market Operator has issued an alert about a possible blackout for some customers in NSW next Tuesday evening \u2013 a fairly rare warning. To be clear, an Aemo alert is NOT a forecast of what\u2019s to come but a call to the market to respond. As of this morning, the supply gap is a bit under 400 megawatts from 4.30pm to 8pm. (Aemo uses AEST time, hence the adjustment to the note in X post below.) The so-called lack of reserve level 3 is a bit of a rare thing. According to Dylan McConnell, an energy expert at UNSW, there has only been one other such alert issued for NSW since 2019 (excluding the market chaos that triggered a suspension in 2022). Across the national electricity market, there have only been 14 LOR3s across the five eastern states (only Western Australia and the Northern Territory are not in the Nem), McConnell says. Part of the issue is an expected spike in power demand as an early season heatwave sweeps across the east. Western Sydney will have had five days with maximums in the 30s by Tuesday, with the CBD forecast to reach 31 on that day too. There\u2019s also a prediction of relatively little wind. However, the coal-fired power plants aren\u2019t looking in good shape. AGL\u2019s Bayswater unit 2 is offline for major maintenance until 8 December. Its unit 3 was also shut for unplanned work, according to WattClarity, an energy website. Other units offline include Vales Point 6, Eraring 3, and Tallawarra 1 (a gas-fired plant), so there\u2019s 2,630MW unavailable. There are also other Aemo alerts at a lesser LOR2 level for both next Monday and Tuesday for NSW. It will be interesting to watch if the market does respond to the Aemo alerts \u2013 or whether other action might need to be take (ie turning off big power users). Littleproud says Coalition\u2019s alternative plan on international student numbers will be detailed before election The leader of the Nationals, David Littleproud, spoke with ABC RN earlier this morning about the Coalition\u2019s decision to oppose government legislation capping international student numbers. He was asked what the Coalition\u2019s alternative plan is, if they\u2019re not backing the legislation? Littleproud said \u201cyou\u2019ll see our detailed caps before the election\u201d. We made it very clear we don\u2019t intend to hide anything \u2026 We intend to reduce our migration and determine who comes to this country, the skills they have and where they should live \u2026 He said that state and local governments need time to build housing supply and \u201cthey need the human capital\u201d to do so: So let\u2019s get our migration working for Australia and making sure we get the settings right, and give the state local government some time to build some homes and give some hope to young people that they might own a home in Australia one day. Independent MP urges federal battery rebate scheme The teal MP Kylea Tink has called on the Albanese government to back a federal battery rebate scheme to support households and small businesses invest in battery storage technology. In a joint statement with Solar Citizens, she says a well-funded rebate scheme, supported by a target of 1m batteries nationally by 2030, would \u201calso create new, well-paid green jobs in our suburbs and towns\u201d. With over 8,000 people calling for a federal battery program, it\u2019s clear voters want the government to support the rollout of small-scale battery storage solutions and it makes absolutely no sense that energy and climate change minister Chris Bowen has to date ignored the petition from Solar Citizens. More than 8,000 people have signed a Solar Citizens petition calling for a federal subsidy to drive the rapid rollout of small-scale battery storage. The statement notes modelling by the Australian Energy Market Operator, showing the equivalent to 1m household batteries are needed nationally by 2030 to harness the rooftop solar uptake and stabilise the energy grid. But household batteries remain the only technology in Aemo\u2019s roadmap without a federal government policy to drive delivery, the statement says. Solar Citizens\u2019 national campaigns director, Joel Pringle, says solar batteries typically cost more than $10,000, with payback periods ranging between five and 10 years. With the current cost-of-living crisis, batteries are often not an affordable option and that\u2019s why government financial support for batteries is needed. Sydney trains will run on Thursday after a small concession from the rail union to delay strike action until Friday, AAP reports, amid an ongoing wage dispute with the government. A months-long dispute between the NSW government and the state branch of the Rail, Tram and Bus Union escalated yesterday when the transport minister, Jo Haylen, announced no train services would run for four days: But early this morning Transport for NSW said it had agreed with the union to run services on Thursday, a relief for Pearl Jam concertgoers who would have had to find alternative transport to Sydney Olympic Park in the evening. A spokesperson said: At this stage the RTBU has not agreed to lift their industrial action they have planned for Friday through to Sunday. The notified bans in place by the union will bring the heavy rail network to a shutdown on Friday, Saturday, and through until Sunday morning this weekend. Haylen is hoping the concession will give the union and the government more time to come to an agreement before the weekend. She told 2GB: It gives us another day to continue our negotiations and hopefully get people where they need to go. But the union industrial action is still planned for Friday and Saturday and we know that\u2019s going to have a massive impact on millions of people who rely on these train services. One-third of young Australians say they are willing to lie, commit violence, send threatening messages to MPs or vandalise government offices in support of a cause they care about. As AAP reports, a new survey by the Susan McKinnon Foundation quizzed 3,000 voters across Australia on their attitudes to political polarisation and social cohesion. The majority, 55%, said Australia has become more divided compared to five years ago, with 27% saying they feel the country is extremely or very divided. Generational differences about how to deal with views on social justice were stark, with between 2% and 4% of people over the age of 55 backing similar responses to their young counterparts. One in three generation Z voters and a quarter of millennial voters said they were prepared to support actions including encouraging or using violence, sending threatening or intimidating messages to members of parliament, damaging property, vandalising government offices and lying to advance a cause they cared about. The program lead at the Susan McKinnon Foundation\u2019s McKinnon poll, Matt Crocker, said the survey reflected \u201csome emerging areas of concern\u201d. While young people have always been passionate for social change, younger people appear more willing to support some practices that can undermine safety and circumvent our democracy. The high level of support for some of these practices is surprising and concerning. A bare majority of Australians believe both extreme left views (51%) and extreme right views (53%) are a serious threat to the country. However, the research also found that those with stronger political views were more likely to blame the other side. It found that 76% of those on the left were much more likely to think extreme right views were a problem, while those on the right (71%) were much more likely to think extreme left views were a problem. Marles says the cost of online scams is rising On ABC RN, the acting PM was asked about the latest Australian Signals Directorate findings that cybercriminals are using fake QR codes or sophisticated AI scams to trick Australians into giving up their private details or downloading dangerous files. Richard Marles said the ASD is seeing reports every six minutes, and the cost of each of those attacks is going up: We are worryingly seeing an increased focus by both cybercriminals and state actors on our critical infrastructure, and that\u2019s something which has become much more prevalent in the course of the last year \u2026 One of the actions that we take is attribution. We have raised attribution in respect of China, in respect of Russia, in respect of Iran. We do so very carefully in circumstances where we can, but attribution is an important tool that we have applied more in the last year than we have ever done. Marles says government will raise Gordon Ng sentence with Chinese government Richard Marles was also asked about news that 45 pro-democracy activists were arrested in Hong Kong, including the Australian-Hong Kong dual national Gordon Ng, after the city\u2019s largest national security trial. He said the government is \u201cvery concerned\u201d, specifically about the sentence applied to Ng, and \u201cwe will continue to make representations in respect of the sentence\u201d. But beyond that, as you say, we are very concerned about the application of the national security law in Hong Kong, and obviously in terms of how it\u2019s been applied to Gordon Ng, and that\u2019s a point that we made when the original conviction occurred \u2026 [This is] a matter that we will continue to raise with the Chinese government in all of our advocacy, and this is a consular matter which is front and centre in terms of the way in which we are engaging with China. Will the government seek to reopen the embassy in Ukraine? Richard Marles said it was \u201csomething we want to do\u201d. We\u2019ve been wanting to do it for some time. We do have our ambassador in the region, who operates out of Warsaw. This is a matter of making sure, obviously, in the context of a war zone, that we can open this in a manner which is safe for all of those who would be in the embassy. And so this continues to be a work in progress around how that can be done, but we are engaging closely with Ukraine. Marles weighs in on latest developments on war on Ukraine Richard Marles also spoke with ABC RN just now, asked about the latest developments out of the war in Ukraine. Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, has formally lowered the threshold for Russia\u2019s use of its nuclear weapons after the Biden administration\u2019s decision to allow Ukraine to strike targets inside Russian territory with US-supplied longer-range weapons. Asked for his reaction, Marles told the program: It\u2019s completely reprehensible on the part of Russia. I mean, there\u2019s only one country which is talking about using nuclear weapons, and that\u2019s Russia \u2026 Russia\u2019s cooperation with North Korea, such that we now have North Korean troops massing on the Ukrainian border, is an appalling escalation in what is already an appalling conflict \u2026 What\u2019s at issue here is the global rules-based order, which is very much in Australia\u2019s national interest, and that\u2019s why we will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes for this conflict to be resolved on its terms. So you don\u2019t see it as a dangerous escalation from the US to allow Ukraine to use these missiles to strike on Russian territory? Marles said this was Ukraine defending itself: Ukraine is the country that was attacked. It was Russia which crossed the border into Ukraine and began this war, and Ukraine has a right to defend itself. It\u2019s not Ukraine who\u2019s talking about an escalation to a nuclear level \u2026 at every point it is Russia which is escalating this. The acting prime minister, Richard Marles, was on ABC News Breakfast earlier and was asked about the Coalition\u2019s attack on the government for not joining a US-UK civil nuclear deal (as we flagged earlier). Marles said the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, is \u201cintentionally seeking to conflate two ideas here and, frankly, spread a form of misinformation really\u201d. We don\u2019t have a civil nuclear industry. This is an agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States to cooperate in respect of their civil nuclear industries. It is simply not an agreement which would apply [and] sits completely separately to what we are doing with the UK and the US in relation to Aukus, which is an agreement that is proceeding very well. Marles said what is \u201cembarrassing\u201d is Dutton\u2019s proposition that \u201cAustralia should walk down from where we are now in having no civil nuclear industry, to trying to acquire one\u201d. That is embarrassing because it would be pursuing for Australia the single most expensive form of electricity on the planet, like $1,200 on each and every household\u2019s budget power bills, that would be the increase by walking down that path. We wouldn\u2019t see it for a couple of decades and even when it came into place, it would contribute at most about 4% to the power grid. Putting that proposition in front of the Australian people, that is what\u2019s embarrassing. Clean Energy Council data shows surge in renewables since 2015 has reduced relative emissions by 30% Kane Thornton, the chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, was up on ABC RN earlier this morning to discuss its new report \u2013 showing a surge in renewables since 2015 has reduced emissions by 30%, relative to if Australia had remained reliant on the 2015 fleet of power stations. This morning, he told the program this was a good news story for the sector: About five years ago, we were at around 15 or 16% of the grid coming from renewables. Today, we\u2019re over 40% and by the end of next year, we\u2019ll be pretty close to 50%. So a pretty dramatic increase in the amount of renewables in the grid, which is obviously great for emissions, it\u2019s also great because coal-fired power stations are starting to close down, they\u2019re starting to get less reliable, and that renewable electricity is also [helping keep] power prices down and keep the lights on. Thornton said the data shows the importance of having confidence about the future and \u201call political parties having a clear vision and \u2026 being aligned on targets\u201d. Where they\u2019ve got that sort of certainty, then investors will put significant money on the table, and that rate of renewables accelerates. Where there\u2019s uncertainty about the future, then the rate of new investment tends to slow down. Cost of living, cybersecurity and AI top ethical considerations for Australians: report The Governance Institute of Australia\u2019s 2024 ethics index shows that cost-of-living pressures and concerns about cybersecurity and AI are the top ethical considerations for Australians. Based on a survey conducted with Ipsos, Australians perceived supermarket pricing as the most unethical behaviour (-50) while perceptions of GPs who don\u2019t offer bulk billing have also fallen further (-33). In terms of government promises ahead of the next federal election, Australians ranked affordable housing, renewable energy and grocery prices as their top three campaign topics. But the Governance Institute CEO, Megan Motto, said clear differences emerge when examining election promises by party preference: Liberal voters favour nuclear power, while Labor voters focus on affordable housing, renewable energy and union actions. There is also a significant difference in perceptions of US relations based on the election result. Fire services (76), nurses (75) and ambulance services (74) were seen as the most ethical jobs, while real estate agents (-18), federal politicians (-15) and state politicians (-6) were seen to be the least ethical. The report also found that the ethical obligation for organisations to tackle climate change, even if it results in reduced profits or job losses, has increased significantly over the past year. The ANU\u2019s National Dictionary Centre has selected the portmanteau \u2013 or blended word \u2013 \u201cColesworth\u201d as its word of the year, highlighting the perceived duopoly of Australia\u2019s largest supermarket retailers Coles and Woolworths. A senior researcher at the centre, Mark Gwynn, says the phrase has been around for a number of years but usage has spiked recently as ordinary Australians vent their frustration at the increasing prices of food staples and questionable pricing practices. Aussies walk out of the supermarket with less after paying more, but then hear news of massive profits in the supermarket sector. And with official investigations into some of the pricing practices at Australia\u2019s two largest supermarkets, it\u2019s no wonder that ordinary shoppers have become cynical. The blend of the supermarket names Coles and Woolworths into Colesworth provides a succinct way of referring to both supermarkets while at the same time hinting at the negative aspects of what is perceived as an unfair duopoly. Some other words on the shortlist were breaking (in reference to Raygun\u2019s Olympic appearance), climate trigger, ute tax (a derogatory term for the new fuel efficiency standard) and YIMBY (yes in my back yard). Oxfam reacts to Australia\u2019s Cop29 pledge Oxfam Australia has welcomed the government\u2019s Cop29 pledge of $50m towards a global loss and damage fund to help the world\u2019s most vulnerable people to repair the damage from climate breakdown. Oxfam said its new research shows a 700% increase in the number of people impacted by climate disasters in the Pacific region this decade, compared to the previous decade. Its climate policy and advocacy lead, Julie-Anne Richards, welcomed the pledge, but said the funding must also be included in the new global climate finance goal for developing countries, which is a key demand of the Pacific and one Australia is yet to support: If climate change losses and damages are not included in the new global climate finance goal, the new fund for responding to loss and damage risks becoming an empty vessel. The danger is that developed country governments will prioritise meeting the new and ambitious climate finance goal, and will not prioritise a fund that doesn\u2019t count towards it. If Australia is to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Pacific, we must ensure the region gets the funding needed to recover from and build back better after climate change impacts, and Australia must be an important contributor alongside the global fund designed for this purpose. Coalition continues attack on government over nuclear deal decision The Nationals senator Matt Canavan was up on the Today show earlier this morning, continuing to criticise the government for not signing up to a civil nuclear deal signed between the US and UK. As Adam Morton reports, the UK government has conceded Australia was mistakenly included on a list of countries expected to sign up to the deal. Yesterday in parliament the acting prime minister, Richard Marles, said the deal goes to nuclear reactors which provide energy to electricity grids, and \u201cwe do not have that in this country, and so as a result \u2026 this agreement is not relevant to Australia\u201d. But today, Canavan is insisting Australia should have joined, telling the program: I don\u2019t want to concern you, Karl [Stefanovic], but you\u2019re sitting only 30km from a nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights in Sydney. We have some of the best nuclear scientists in the world. And sure, it doesn\u2019t produce nuclear energy, but it produces some of the world\u2019s best nuclear medicines. And because of that expertise, we have always been involved in these international developments to look at new nuclear technologies which might help us make better nuclear medicines in the future. And of course, the current government is buying eight nuclear submarines. And so why shouldn\u2019t we be involved in an international discussion about nuclear technologies? What the hell is going on? Canavan argued that the prime minister should \u201crecall Chris Bowen here and override this for our national security\u201d. It seems like it\u2019s been a decision made by just the energy minister. Has this been considered by the cabinet? Has this been considered by the whole of government? Because there are a whole lot of other questions that arise here about why the government is making this decision. The only explanation is they\u2019re doing so for pure domestic political purposes. Gender pay gap data reveals Australia\u2019s female CEOs paid $170,000 less than men on average Circling back to Jim Chalmers\u2019 economic statement to parliament today, one of the claims he\u2019ll make is that the gender pay gap is at a record low. According to government figures today, the pay gap is 21.1%, an improvement on last year\u2019s figure (21.7%). However, when the pay of chief executives and heads of business is included, the figure is higher at 21.8%. Our story today leads on the gap in top pay with women CEOs earning $170,000 less than male counterparts. Here\u2019s the full story: The number of vacant rentals nationally has jumped to its highest level since July 2023, according to the latest PropTrack Market Insight Report. The report found that the national rental vacancy rate increased by 0.19% points (ppt) in October to 1.36%, as capital city vacancies rose 0.33ppt year-on-year, while regional areas saw a 0.13ppt decline over the same period. A healthy vacancy rate is widely regarded to be 3%. REA Group senior economist Anne Flaherty said: Rental conditions improved in all capital cities and regional markets over October, with the national vacancy rate now 0.21ppt higher than at the same time last year. Despite the improvement, rental supply remains well below pre-pandemic levels, with 35% fewer properties available for rent. While rental supply improved across both capital city and regional markets in October, there has been greater relief for renters in cities. Over the past year, vacancy rates in capital cities rose by 0.33ppt, while the combined regional areas remain 0.13ppt lower than a year ago. Compared to March 2020, there were 45% fewer properties available for rent in Australia\u2019s regional areas compared to a 32% drop in the capital cities. Emily Wind here, signing on for blogging duties as we reach the halfway point of the second-last sitting week of this year. You\u2019ll have the whole Canberra team bringing you the latest today \u2013 Karen Middleton, Paul Karp, Josh Butler and Sarah Basford Canales. Let\u2019s get started. The politics of Australian electoral reform \u2013 Full Story podcast Big money and politics seem to go hand in hand, but the government wants to pass new electoral reform laws that they say will keep cashed-up donors out of federal politics. The detail has independents and minor parties crying foul. In today\u2019s Full Story podcast, Guardian Australia chief political correspondent Paul Karp speaks to Reged Ahmed about why Labor and the Coalition have been accused of cooking up a \u201csecret deal\u201d on new electoral rules. Another area where the two main parties agree in theory is international student caps. But they\u2019ve managed to fall out a bit. Our explainer today looks at what\u2019s behind the stoush. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will today deliver an economic statement to parliament setting out the progress the government has made on key indicators and causes for optimism about the economy and the budget. In advance excerpts released by his office, Chalmers will claim that inflation has more than halved, real wages are growing again and the economy is expanding. He will say that one million new jobs have been created and that two huge deficits have been turned into two substantial surpluses. At every stage we have been upfront about the nature and magnitude of our economic challenges. Even with very substantial progress in the aggregate numbers, we know that doesn\u2019t always translate to how people are faring and feeling day-to-day. We\u2019re not pretending its mission accomplished \u2013 it isn\u2019t. We are realistic about this, but optimistic too. Today as I provide a stocktake of the global and domestic economy preview the mid-year update which we will hand down in December. And outline our policies and plans. I will explain why that very cautious confidence and emerging optimism is welcome and warranted. Of course the bit they\u2019ve given us doesn\u2019t tell us what\u2019s in the mid-year economic update. You\u2019ll just have to tune in at midday, and then again in mid-December for that. It\u2019s forward sizzle. It\u2019s the advent calendar approach, you can\u2019t have all your chocolates at once. More on the record number of GPs in training The RACGP president, Dr Nicole Higgins, said the increased number of GPs in training is a reflection of how the government has provided the college with the flexibility and the funding to accommodate prospective trainees. Higgins praised the government\u2019s rapid support for requests including funding for accommodation, travel and childcare that allowed the college to place 177 general GPs in training in rural communities that had not had a registrar in years. However, she warned the government must make lasting investments to tackle Australia\u2019s GP shortage and ensure Australians can see a GP regularly: This 20% growth in GPs in training is a sign the GP workforce is recovering. But it can\u2019t be taken as a sign the job is done. The story we\u2019ve been told, and that we\u2019ve often told each other as GPs, is one of general practice in decline. These training results show us we can turn that around with the right investments, because funding general practice gets results. The college is calling on the government to link the allocation of government-subsidised medical places to a target of 50% of graduates training as GPs, fund 500 more training program places for the RACGP over the next five years and ensure GPs in training have equal pay and work entitlements to other medical specialists in training. A record number of GPs will be trained in 2025, the first time in years the specialty has filled all its training positions, which will go some way towards addressing Australia\u2019s GP shortage. A government report in August, which found that a shortfall of more than 5,000 GPs was expected in the next decade, was the latest in a number of warnings that as more Australians live with chronic conditions, not enough medical graduates are choosing general practice as a career. However, the Royal Australian College of GPs (RACGP) has today confirmed the trend is turning around, with 1,504 junior doctors having accepted specialist training through the college\u2019s program. It represents an increase of 20% \u2013 or 249 trainees \u2013 on 2024. The signs are also positive for the regional and remote areas the government report found were most at risk from the shortage, with 844 trainees accepting a general training pathway, 583 a rural pathway, and 77 composite rural placements. Good morning and welcome to our live politics blog. I\u2019m Martin Farrer with the best of the overnight stories before Emily Wind takes the reins. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has declared the landmark Paris agreement \u201cis working\u201d as it had brought the world back from \u201cthe brink of catastrophic 4C warming\u201d, but argued countries must set the most ambitious emissions targets possible for 2035 to limit worsening global heating. Speaking at the Cop29 summit in Baku, Bowen also pledged $50m towards a global loss and damage fund to help the world\u2019s most vulnerable people to repair the damage from climate breakdown. Reaction coming up. KiiS FM, the radio station that is home to the graphic and at times derisive Kyle and Jackie O show, this year attracted the biggest share of listeners aged 10 to 17, Guardian Australia can reveal. That is more than 200,000 children and teenagers listening to the station in Sydney alone. But despite children being exposed to inappropriate material on the station\u2019s top-rating show, the Australian Communications and Media Authority has failed to launch its own investigation into the program. A record number of GPs will be trained in 2025, the first time in years the specialty has filled all its training positions, which will go some way towards addressing Australia\u2019s GP shortage. More details coming up. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will spruik the government\u2019s economic achievements in parliament today. He will claim that inflation has more than halved, real wages are growing again and the economy is expanding. He will also claim that the gender pay gap is at a record low although there is a little bit more to those figures than meets the eye as our story on the subject reveals. More coming up.",

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Dr Sara Whitburn, the deputy medical director at Sexual Health Victoria, said while greater access to testing is crucial for reducing transmission of sexually transmitted infections, and new initiatives to encourage testing are welcome, there are important caveats around the home test. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the test is validated only for vaginal samples, meaning it cannot be used to screen for oral or anal chlamydia and gonorrhoea,\u201d she said. The test developer, Touch Biotechnology, states that when the test was compared against urine PCR testing, it correctly identified more than 99% of positive cases for both chlamydia and gonorrhoea, and did not produce any false positives. However, these results are based on the company\u2019s own testing of 312 people, and the findings have not been published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. \u201cAs a screening test, it is recommended that individuals consult a healthcare professional for a repeat PCR test to confirm a positive diagnosis,\u201d Whitburn said. \u201cThis reliance on follow-up testing may inadvertently delay diagnosis and treatment, especially if individuals do not seek a health professional assessment.\u201d She said people who seek testing for sexually transmitted disease at a sexual health or GP clinic are more likely to be offered comprehensive asymptomatic screening, which would typically include tests for HIV and syphilis. The Royal College of Pathologists (RCPA) issued a warning in July of a concerning rise in cases of gonorrhoea, syphilis and HIV nationally. As part of the conditions of approval, the TGA has stated Touch Biotechnology must maintain a post-market surveillance report, including information on any adverse events, including numbers of any reported false positive or false negative results. Whitburn said people with genital or pelvic symptoms may feel a sense of false reassurance with a negative result from a home chlamydia and gonorrhoea test, which \u201cdoes not allow for a complete history and examination\u201d. Symptoms could be related to another infection, or a condition such as candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, a dermatological condition, or a urinary tract infection, she said, all of which require medical professionals to diagnose and treat.

The Guardian understands that Aviva Investors will put three incinerators into administration this week after pouring millions of pounds into what has been described as the country\u2019s \u201cdirtiest form of power generation\u201d. Aviva\u2019s own accounts show that the three incinerator plants \u2013 in Hull in East Yorkshire, Boston in Lincolnshire and Barry in south Wales \u2013 accumulated loans totalling \u00a3480m from its investors between 2015 and 2023. Aviva has written off \u00a3368m for the plants, which were originally intended to run on biomass waste wood and later converted to burn household waste, but which struggled to reach their targets. A source said Aviva had originally hoped to play a role in supporting renewable energy alternatives but it had become apparent that the technology posed significant challenges that would require more investment to solve. There were 60 fully operational energy-from-waste (EfW) plants in the UK at the end of last year, which generated about 3.1% of the country\u2019s total net power generation and kept 16m tonnes of residual waste from heading to landfill. But critics of incinerators argue that generating energy from burning waste contributes to greenhouse gas emissions compared with renewable power and may deter efforts to cut single-use plastics and improve recycling.

      "body": "<p>The creators of a play telling the shameful story of how the black boxer Cuthbert Taylor was prevented from competing for a British title because of his colour hoped it would give audiences pause for thought.</p> <p>But they have been overwhelmed by the passionate reaction of young theatregoers who have launched a campaign demanding a formal apology from the sport\u2019s governing body.</p> <p>Hundreds of children from south Wales, where Taylor lived, have written letters to the British Boxing Board of Control calling on it to formally apologise for one of the sport\u2019s enduring wrongs.</p> <p>More than 300 children from 13 schools have so far sent letters and emails to the board after watching the play, <a href=\"https://theatr-nanog.co.uk/the-fight\">The Fight</a>, and they have been backed by Welsh politicians including the country\u2019s culture minister, <a href=\"https://www.gov.wales/jack-sargeant-ms\">Jack Sargeant</a>.</p> <p>Although Taylor competed as a flyweight for Great Britain at the 1928 Olympics, his potential was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/30/family-of-black-boxer-barred-from-british-title-fights-call-for-apology\">never completely fulfilled</a> because of the colour bar.</p> <p>The bar, which ran <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/3190661/British_Boxing_s_Colour_Bar_1911_48\">from 1911 to 1948</a>, said fighters had to have \u201ctwo white parents\u201d to compete for British titles. Born in 1909 in Merthyr Tydfil to a father of Caribbean descent and white Welsh mother, Taylor was not allowed to fight for a title.</p> <p>Young people from schools in south Wales decided to call for an apology after watching the Neath-based <a href=\"https://www.theatr-nanog.co.uk/\">Theatr na n\u00d3g\u2019s</a> retelling of Taylor\u2019s story.</p> <p>One of the letters to the board reads: \u201cWe think that it is unfair that Cuthbert Taylor and other boxers without white, British parents were not allowed to fight for the British title. The colour bar was horrendous, horrific and disgraceful. It was not right then and it is not right now.\u201d </p> <p>It adds: \u201cIt was probably his dream to be the British boxing champion, but your colour bar stopped his dream from coming true.\u201d</p> <p>Schools that have written to the board include Cwmnedd primary in the Neath Valley, St Joseph\u2019s Catholic junior, Port Talbot; Ysgol Gymraeg Santes Tudful in Merthyr Tydfil and Llanfaes community primary in Brecon. The number of schools involved continues to grow.</p> <p>Aisling Brady Saunders, the deputy headteacher at St Joseph\u2019s, said: \u201cIt was entirely the children\u2019s idea to pen letters \u2013 they feel very strongly that Cuthbert Taylor, his surviving family and all boxers affected by the colour bar rule should have an apology.\u201d</p> <p>Geinor Styles, the writer of The Fight, said she had suspected the story would be compelling to young people. She said: \u201cWe have seen the power that true stories can play in overturning injustices, like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/post-office-horizon-scandal\">Post Office story</a>. The Fight has been a humbling experience for us all, observing schoolchildren not only engage in a live theatrical performance but inspired to take positive action.</p> <p>\u201cI am surprised how the children have taken the initiative here but I have always believed that theatre has the power to change lives and this is a fine example. I would hope this will be a tipping point for an apology. After all, an apology costs nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor\u2019s grandson Alun Taylor said: \u201cOur grandfather was denied his basic human rights because of the colour of his skin.

      "bodyText": "The creators of a play telling the shameful story of how the black boxer Cuthbert Taylor was prevented from competing for a British title because of his colour hoped it would give audiences pause for thought. But they have been overwhelmed by the passionate reaction of young theatregoers who have launched a campaign demanding a formal apology from the sport\u2019s governing body. Hundreds of children from south Wales, where Taylor lived, have written letters to the British Boxing Board of Control calling on it to formally apologise for one of the sport\u2019s enduring wrongs. More than 300 children from 13 schools have so far sent letters and emails to the board after watching the play, The Fight, and they have been backed by Welsh politicians including the country\u2019s culture minister, Jack Sargeant. Although Taylor competed as a flyweight for Great Britain at the 1928 Olympics, his potential was never completely fulfilled because of the colour bar. The bar, which ran from 1911 to 1948, said fighters had to have \u201ctwo white parents\u201d to compete for British titles. Born in 1909 in Merthyr Tydfil to a father of Caribbean descent and white Welsh mother, Taylor was not allowed to fight for a title. Young people from schools in south Wales decided to call for an apology after watching the Neath-based Theatr na n\u00d3g\u2019s retelling of Taylor\u2019s story. One of the letters to the board reads: \u201cWe think that it is unfair that Cuthbert Taylor and other boxers without white, British parents were not allowed to fight for the British title. The colour bar was horrendous, horrific and disgraceful. It was not right then and it is not right now.\u201d It adds: \u201cIt was probably his dream to be the British boxing champion, but your colour bar stopped his dream from coming true.\u201d Schools that have written to the board include Cwmnedd primary in the Neath Valley, St Joseph\u2019s Catholic junior, Port Talbot; Ysgol Gymraeg Santes Tudful in Merthyr Tydfil and Llanfaes community primary in Brecon. The number of schools involved continues to grow. Aisling Brady Saunders, the deputy headteacher at St Joseph\u2019s, said: \u201cIt was entirely the children\u2019s idea to pen letters \u2013 they feel very strongly that Cuthbert Taylor, his surviving family and all boxers affected by the colour bar rule should have an apology.\u201d Geinor Styles, the writer of The Fight, said she had suspected the story would be compelling to young people. She said: \u201cWe have seen the power that true stories can play in overturning injustices, like the Post Office story. The Fight has been a humbling experience for us all, observing schoolchildren not only engage in a live theatrical performance but inspired to take positive action. \u201cI am surprised how the children have taken the initiative here but I have always believed that theatre has the power to change lives and this is a fine example. I would hope this will be a tipping point for an apology. After all, an apology costs nothing.\u201d Taylor\u2019s grandson Alun Taylor said: \u201cOur grandfather was denied his basic human rights because of the colour of his skin. Theatr na n\u00d3g is giving him a voice, and in doing so they are giving our family a voice as well.\u201d Sargent said: \u201cI am in full support of the pupils. I have requested a formal apology from the BBBC.\u201d A letter from the board to another of the schools, Ysgol Gymraeg y Cwm, acknowledges receipt of the letters and says: \u201cWe will be in contact again. Please pass on our thanks to the children.\u201d In response, the board said boxing was one of the \u201cmost diverse and inclusive sports\u201d in the UK and acknowledged that the colour ban was wrong, but it declined to apologise. It said: \u201cOf course, the board acknowledges that the implementation of the \u2018colour bar\u2019 was discriminatory, and the board accepts this was wrong. Indeed, the British Boxing Board of Control condemn in the strongest terms the colour bar that existed in professional boxing between 1911 and 1948.\u201d But it said: \u201cThe suggestion of holding the current British Boxing Board of Control responsible for the decisions of past board members is deeply unsatisfactory. It is our view that any apology to the Taylor family regarding Cuthbert Taylor should be government-led as the \u2018colour bar\u2019 was imposed at the request of the [UK] government.\u201d The Fight has been performed to more than 4,600 children at the Dylan Thomas theatre in Swansea and this week is being staged at Theatr Brycheiniog, Brecon.",

UK Music, the umbrella organisation representing the commercial music industry from artists and record labels to the live music sector, said that the economic value of the industry to the UK economy surged by almost \u00a31bn in 2023. UK tours by top acts including Elton John\u2019s last live shows, Ed Sheeran, Blur, Harry Styles and Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 who was credited by one economist for Sweden reporting higher than expected inflation as fans flocked to her Stockholm gig \u2013 helped drive music\u2019s contribution to the UK economy up by 13% to a record \u00a37.6bn. \u201cA decade which began with the pandemic, causing much devastation to the sector, has seen a resilient music industry emerge,\u201d said Tom Kiehl, the chief executive of UK Music. It also proved to be a bumper year for British music \u201cexports\u201d, with acts touring internationally including Coldplay, Styles, Arctic Monkeys and Adele, who has had a residency at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. The revenue from UK music exports hit a new high of \u00a34.6bn last year, up 15% on the \u00a34bn recorded in 2022. The live music boom also meant that industry employment hit a record high of 216,000 full-time equivalent posts last year, up 3% from 210,000 in 2022. However, while the big-name acts proved to be cash cows for the industry, the report highlighted figures from the Music Venue Trust charity which showed that about 125 grassroots music venues across the UK closed last year, and more than 350 are at risk of shutting down. Since the live music shutdown during the Covid pandemic, the festival sector has also struggled to rebound, with many smaller-scale events disappearing or struggling to continue. The Association of Independent Festivals has said that 60 festivals announced postponement, cancellation or closure this year, while 192 have disappeared since 2019, just before the Covid pandemic. Kiehl said that, despite the record figures, the music sector faced major threats from issues such as the remuneration artists receive from streaming, and the increasing impact of a loss of earnings from unlicensed artificial intelligence programmes using their work without permission. \u201cThis is not a time to be complacent,\u201d said Kiehl. \u201cThe UK music industry has vulnerabilities, too. \u201cIncreasing global competition, tough financial conditions for artists and the grassroots, as well as the wild west that is generative AI, are all conspiring to be significant challenges for the sector. \u201cWe are now at a tipping point, and if the problems we face are not addressed then future growth cannot be guaranteed.\u201d The industry body\u2019s annual This is Music report gauges the financial health of the industry and its contribution to the wider UK economy, spanning music sales and licensing to all UK tours and international touring by British artists as well as merchandise, which it measures as gross value added (GVA).",

Camerimage has said that the screening is solely intended to honour Hutchins, who had attended Camerimage and spoken privately of her wishes to have her work shown there.</p> \n<p>Allred said Solovey would not attend because Baldwin had \u201cdisrespected\u201d Hutchins\u2019 family.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven though Mr Baldwin discharged the gun that killed Halyna, he has never called them to apologise,\u201d she said. \u201cEven worse, he argued, through his attorneys, that Halyna was emotionally distant from her family in Ukraine. That is false, hurtful and insulting.</p> \n<p>\u201cFurther, the decision not to even call the family to say he is sorry is cruel and dishonours Halyna and her memory. Now, a decision has been made to promote Rust to buyers in order to make a profit for Alec Baldwin and others that had a role in Halyna\u2019s death.\u201d</p> \n<p>Solovey filed a civil negligence lawsuit against Baldwin in June. On Tuesday, Allred confirmed to the Press Association that Baldwin has filed a motion to pause the civil lawsuit against him and others.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will be opposing their motion to stay our case,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>In her own statement, Solovey said: \u201cIt was always my hope to meet my daughter in Poland to watch her work come alive on screen. Unfortunately, that was ripped away from me when Alec Baldwin discharged his gun and killed my daughter.</p> \n<p>Solovey alleged Baldwin has not apologised to her, saying: \u201cAlec Baldwin continues to increase my pain with his refusal to apologise to me and his refusal to take responsibility for her death.</p> \n<p>\u201cInstead, he seeks to unjustly profit from his killing of my daughter.

The decision to complete Rust was made with the full support of Halyna\u2019s family.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Camerimage festival celebrates the artistry of cinematographers; it is not a festival for buyers.

      "bodyText": "The mother of Halyna Hutchins, the cinematographer who was fatally shot on the set of the film Rust by actor Alec Baldwin, has refused to attend the film\u2019s world premiere on Wednesday, alleging the star has still not apologised to her over her daughter\u2019s death. Rust will premiere at the Camerimage festival in Poland, an event focusing on achievements in cinematography, three years after the prop gun Baldwin was holding went off and fatally injured Hutchins, the film\u2019s cinematographer, on the set of the western in New Mexico. Tickets to the premiere sold out quickly on Tuesday. It comes months after a New Mexico judge threw out the involuntary manslaughter case against Baldwin, finding that the state had improperly withheld evidence. Baldwin, who stars in and produced the film, has long maintained he did not pull the trigger. Hutchins\u2019 mother, Olga Solovey, and her lawyer, Gloria Allred, both issued statements on Tuesday to announce Solovey would not be attending the premiere. Camerimage has said that the screening is solely intended to honour Hutchins, who had attended Camerimage and spoken privately of her wishes to have her work shown there. Allred said Solovey would not attend because Baldwin had \u201cdisrespected\u201d Hutchins\u2019 family. \u201cEven though Mr Baldwin discharged the gun that killed Halyna, he has never called them to apologise,\u201d she said. \u201cEven worse, he argued, through his attorneys, that Halyna was emotionally distant from her family in Ukraine. That is false, hurtful and insulting. \u201cFurther, the decision not to even call the family to say he is sorry is cruel and dishonours Halyna and her memory. Now, a decision has been made to promote Rust to buyers in order to make a profit for Alec Baldwin and others that had a role in Halyna\u2019s death.\u201d Solovey filed a civil negligence lawsuit against Baldwin in June. On Tuesday, Allred confirmed to the Press Association that Baldwin has filed a motion to pause the civil lawsuit against him and others. \u201cWe will be opposing their motion to stay our case,\u201d she said. In her own statement, Solovey said: \u201cIt was always my hope to meet my daughter in Poland to watch her work come alive on screen. Unfortunately, that was ripped away from me when Alec Baldwin discharged his gun and killed my daughter. Solovey alleged Baldwin has not apologised to her, saying: \u201cAlec Baldwin continues to increase my pain with his refusal to apologise to me and his refusal to take responsibility for her death. \u201cInstead, he seeks to unjustly profit from his killing of my daughter. That is the reason why I refuse to attend the festival for the promotion of Rust, especially now when there is still no justice for my daughter.\u201d Rust director Joel Souza, who was wounded in the shooting, is expected to introduce the premiere on Wednesday, along with Bianca Cline, the cinematographer who completed the film. Camerimage festival director Kazimierz Suwala told the Hollywood Reporter earlier this week: \u201cWe didn\u2019t invite Alec Baldwin, and we never considered doing so. That would be too distracting. What this is about is honouring Halyna\u2019s dreams for her work.\u201d Melina Spadone, representative for Rust Movie Productions, told the Guardian: \u201cGloria Allred\u2019s misrepresentation of both the Camerimage festival and any profit motivation is disappointing. The decision to complete Rust was made with the full support of Halyna\u2019s family. \u201cThe Camerimage festival celebrates the artistry of cinematographers; it is not a festival for buyers. None of the producers of Rust stand to benefit financially from the film. The suggestion that those involved in completing Halyna Hutchins\u2019 film were motivated by profit is disrespectful to those who worked tirelessly to honour her legacy.\u201d The film\u2019s armourer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, is serving an 18-month prison sentence after she was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter after the shooting of Hutchins in October 2021, at a ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe. Rust tells the story of a 13-year-old boy who, left to fend for himself and his younger brother after their parents\u2019 deaths in 1880s Wyoming, goes on the run with his long-estranged grandfather after being sentenced to hang for the accidental killing of a local rancher. Last month, the judge in Baldwin\u2019s involuntary manslaughter trial declined an appeal by the prosecution to reconsider her decision to dismiss the case against the actor.

      "body": "<p>Memories of our favourite open-fronted barn in Bedfordshire are forever tarnished by our final visit before moving. Prior to that, we always made a point of pausing in the doorway and checking no one was home before entering. On its concrete floor, there was a regular smattering of pellets \u2013 solid evidence that owls had been roosting in the rafters, though I never saw one there. On that last day, we walked in chattering and forgot to stop. We had barely crossed the threshold when a reproachful spirit flew at us and over our heads. Our daytime thoughtlessness had stolen a part of a barn owl\u2019s night. And I confess that I gained a guilty thrill from the intimate encounter that this careless transgression had given us.</p> <p>I felt an echo of that experience after I sneezed in a Somerset churchyard. Ninety minutes after sunrise, we had walked around an established mown path to the back of a squat church tower, talking in low, muted voices. Just beneath the sloping, slate-tiled roof was a narrow window \u2013 like a castle arrow slit. We had both glanced up and noticed a tangle of sticks poking out from the base. Somebody had nested there \u2013 maybe a pair of jackdaws? It was then that I couldn\u2019t help giving an explosive sneeze.</p> <p>A light arrow spilled out of the slot, opened its wings and took flight over the graves.

      "bodyText": "Memories of our favourite open-fronted barn in Bedfordshire are forever tarnished by our final visit before moving. Prior to that, we always made a point of pausing in the doorway and checking no one was home before entering. On its concrete floor, there was a regular smattering of pellets \u2013 solid evidence that owls had been roosting in the rafters, though I never saw one there. On that last day, we walked in chattering and forgot to stop. We had barely crossed the threshold when a reproachful spirit flew at us and over our heads. Our daytime thoughtlessness had stolen a part of a barn owl\u2019s night. And I confess that I gained a guilty thrill from the intimate encounter that this careless transgression had given us. I felt an echo of that experience after I sneezed in a Somerset churchyard. Ninety minutes after sunrise, we had walked around an established mown path to the back of a squat church tower, talking in low, muted voices. Just beneath the sloping, slate-tiled roof was a narrow window \u2013 like a castle arrow slit. We had both glanced up and noticed a tangle of sticks poking out from the base. Somebody had nested there \u2013 maybe a pair of jackdaws? It was then that I couldn\u2019t help giving an explosive sneeze. A light arrow spilled out of the slot, opened its wings and took flight over the graves. Barn owls don\u2019t make nests with sticks; this bird must have taken over the crow\u2019s nest as a winter roost, and I believe my involuntary exclamation had shaken it out. Very light-coloured birds \u2013 swans, egrets, barn owls \u2013 may give an illusion of deliberate, leisurely wingbeats, but this owl was in a fast flap. It was quickly apparent, however, that it was not so much escaping from but flying to a particular spot. Once in the open, it knew exactly where it was going, taking a direct route over the graveyard wall and up into a high hedge at the far side of the next field. It wrapped itself in invisibility, this light sleeper, clearly ready to put snoozing plan B into operation. \u2022 Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian\u2019s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order at guardianbookshop.com and get a 15% discount",

      "bodyText": "A woman has revealed how an undercover police officer formed a long-term intimate relationship with her without disclosing his real identity, vanished from her life \u2013 and then reappeared seven years later. When the officer came back, she says, he persuaded her to break up with her then boyfriend of five years, saying he wanted to resume their relationship and have children together. He then slept with her for a single night, disappearing from her life again before dawn the next morning without explanation. She feared he had made her pregnant as he had not wanted to use a condom, and so she had to get the morning-after pill. The woman, known as Maya, has described how the officer, who used the fake name Rob Harrison, tormented her during their relationship with what she felt was controlling and coercive behaviour, such as regularly accusing her \u2013 falsely \u2013 of infidelity via text messages and then not speaking to her. She said his abusive behaviour drove her to self-harm and to use heroin. \u201cSometimes I hope that he really loved me. Other times I think, \u2018oh, you sick bastard\u2019,\u201d she said. Maya had started the one-year relationship with \u201cHarrison\u201d in 2006, while he was infiltrating pro-Palestinian campaigners. His conduct is to be examined by a judge-led public inquiry, which is looking at how about 139 undercover officers spied on more than 1,000 predominantly leftwing groups between 1968 and at least 2010. One of the key issues for the inquiry is how the police spies frequently formed intimate relationships with women, often lasting years, without telling them they were undercover officers infiltrating political groups. Some fathered children during their deployments. Harrison declined to comment. His lawyer said the officer had \u201cprovided a detailed statement to the inquiry and is co-operating with the inquiry\u201d and believed that was \u201cthe correct venue\u201d to deal with the matter. Maya found out only in 2019 that Harrison was a police officer, which caused her to experience periods of suicidal feelings and further self-harm. In a three-year covert deployment that started in 2004, Harrison infiltrated the International Solidarity Movement, a group supporting Palestinians, and anti-war campaigns. As part of his fake persona, he said he had a job as a sound engineer in south London and was a DJ called Boogie Knight. What Maya calls her \u201cshittiest relationship\u201d started in May 2006. She was not politically active \u2013 but lived next door to campaigners in south London and socialised with them. At a fundraising concert, Harrison made a sudden move on her, she said, asking out of the blue \u2013 \u201c\u2018So you want to kiss me now?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, what?. I was shocked and flattered at the same time.\u201d She was in her 20s, younger than Harrison, and inexperienced in relationships. During their relationship, she said, he saw her only when he visited her home at night, and they would rarely go out as a couple. \u201cI pretty much isolated myself from people who were very good friends,\u201d she said. She said she wondered \u201chow much was he really using me to spy on people, versus how much was he using me just for sex, because, when he would come round, it would be 11 at night, one in the morning, these kind of crazy hours. \u201cI was always getting text messages \u2026 accusing me of running off with somebody else \u2026 he just wouldn\u2019t reply to any of my calls. And so that would make me more frantic.\u201d She added: \u201cI indulged in a lot of self-harm. And then I would tell him afterwards. And then he [would say] \u2018I don\u2019t want you to hurt yourself\u2019. And then we\u2019re back together. Then he comes up with more accusations. And it was just like this cycle. \u201cI would have my phone constantly on, because he\u2019d be sending a text message at one in the morning, saying, \u2018look out the window\u2019. And I look out the window, and there he is outside the window, and then he comes into the house.\u201d She added that she feared that if she did not answer, he would accuse her of sleeping with another man. \u201cIt just made me constantly on anxiety mode for many months because I was even too afraid to go to sleep in case he had texted,\u201d she said. She added: \u201cHe led me to believe that his outbursts of unreasonable behaviour were due to past trauma\u201d.

But Rold\u00e1n\u2019s miniature sculpture of the holy family is more likely to elicit pangs of tenderness and recognition.</p> <p>\u201cI think La Roldana was a great sculptor who was able to transmit emotion through small objects,\u201d said Arias. \u201cWhile she made sculptures of different sizes, these small pieces really reflect her importance as the transmitter of a very concrete message. It\u2019s more intimate. This is closeup stuff and it shows her importance.\u201d</p> <p>That importance will be celebrated further later this month when the <a href=\"https://www.cultura.gob.es/mnescultura/inicio.html\">National Sculpture Museum</a> in Valladolid opens an exhibition celebrating the artist, who died in 1706. The show, <em>Luisa Rold\u00e1n: Escultora Real</em>, will be the first the museum has dedicated to a female sculptor.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a play on words in the title,\u201d says the show\u2019s curator, Miguel \u00c1ngel Marcos. \u201cReal in Spanish has two meanings \u2013 royal and real. So it\u2019s playing on her being a sculptor to the king \u2013 which was the highest honour to which an artist during the Spanish baroque could aspire \u2013 and that fact that she was a real sculptor whose importance was hobbled because she was a woman.\u201d</p>    <p>For Marcos \u2013 as for his colleagues at the Prado \u2013 the remarkable thing about La Roldana was her blend of technical ability and humanity, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/01/madrid-museum-of-royal-collections-art-spain\">a blend that transcends the straightforwardly devotional</a>.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the singular things about her style is the fact that many of her figures are smiling and sometimes openly laughing,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the time, smiling wasn\u2019t really seen as a good thing, so that shows how singular and independent her style was. There\u2019s a very human touch.\u201d</p>",

The exhibition, Hand in Hand: Sculpture and Colour in the Spanish Golden Age, seeks to show that the western artistic canon has not only discriminated against certain artists on the grounds of geography and gender, but also because of the materials they used. \u201cFor a long time, people thought only marble and bronze sculptures were great art, and that wooden or polychrome wooden sculptures belonged to a lesser category,\u201d said the Prado\u2019s director, Miguel Falomir. \u201cThat\u2019s a very biased view of ancient art, based on the idea that classical artists only used marble and bronze and that they did not use colour.\u201d To that end, the show begins with a first century AD sculpture of Venus, found in a house in Pompeii in 1873, that still bears traces of its original paint. According to the show\u2019s curator, Manuel Arias, the polychrome statues were intended as a kind of visual theatre, just as their classical forerunners had been. \u201cThese sculptures were meant to persuade people \u2013 but we didn\u2019t invent them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about seeing that all this forms part of a sequence that was interrupted during the Renaissance, when they started to make archaeological discoveries of sculptures that had lost their polychrome and which gave rise to the idea that the sculptures of antiquity were white.\u201d Arias, who is the head of the sculpture department at the Prado, said the devotional statues were designed to startle and beguile those who beheld them. In the case of Gregorio Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s recumbent, tortured Christ, the viewer\u2019s feelings would have been pity, horror and awe. But Rold\u00e1n\u2019s miniature sculpture of the holy family is more likely to elicit pangs of tenderness and recognition. \u201cI think La Roldana was a great sculptor who was able to transmit emotion through small objects,\u201d said Arias. \u201cWhile she made sculptures of different sizes, these small pieces really reflect her importance as the transmitter of a very concrete message. It\u2019s more intimate. This is closeup stuff and it shows her importance.\u201d That importance will be celebrated further later this month when the National Sculpture Museum in Valladolid opens an exhibition celebrating the artist, who died in 1706. The show, Luisa Rold\u00e1n: Escultora Real, will be the first the museum has dedicated to a female sculptor. \u201cThere\u2019s a play on words in the title,\u201d says the show\u2019s curator, Miguel \u00c1ngel Marcos. \u201cReal in Spanish has two meanings \u2013 royal and real. So it\u2019s playing on her being a sculptor to the king \u2013 which was the highest honour to which an artist during the Spanish baroque could aspire \u2013 and that fact that she was a real sculptor whose importance was hobbled because she was a woman.\u201d For Marcos \u2013 as for his colleagues at the Prado \u2013 the remarkable thing about La Roldana was her blend of technical ability and humanity, a blend that transcends the straightforwardly devotional. \u201cOne of the singular things about her style is the fact that many of her figures are smiling and sometimes openly laughing,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the time, smiling wasn\u2019t really seen as a good thing, so that shows how singular and independent her style was. There\u2019s a very human touch.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A magistrate and HR executive in her late 50s, settled, single, not dating or sexually active, Jo felt that her risk of becoming a victim of rape had passed, or was certainly low \u2013 and that drug-facilitated rape in particular was something that happened to young people, in clubs, at parties, \u201con the apps\u201d. When it happened to her two years ago, it was her adult son who had to make sense of it, and explain why she\u2019d woken up naked beside a man she had no feelings for, blood on the bed, pain between her legs, her memory of that night a blank space.</p> <p>Her rapist was someone she had known since secondary school, a former classmate who, until that week in November 2022, she hadn\u2019t seen since their final A-level. At some point, he had emigrated and then connected with Jo (not her real name) through Friends Reunited. They messaged once a year around their birthdays, which were close together. That was the only contact they had until he got in touch to say he was back visiting family, and how about a coffee?</p> <p>It was strange from the start. Jo expected nothing more than a friendly catch-up. He was married with teenage children. Jo was long divorced. They realised that one of their favourite bands was playing locally in a week\u2019s time, so they booked tickets together. Then, that first day, quite out of the blue, he told Jo that he loved her, had always loved her and wanted to find a way to be together.</p> <p>\u201cI was taken aback,\u201d says Jo, \u201cmaybe a bit flattered, bowled over. I\u2019d never once thought of him that way. I went home and as the days passed, he kept messaging me, getting so full-on and a bit stalkerish, as if he was desperate to see me. I was trying to be polite and I agreed to meet him again to put him straight. I made it clear that I didn\u2019t feel the same. The truth was that I wasn\u2019t attracted to him \u2013 and he was married. I had been single and content for years, and I\u2019d never consider getting involved with a married man.\u201d</p> <p>They still had the concert, though, so Jo went along, hoping they could part without any hard feelings. \u201cAfter the gig, we walked into a pub, he bought us drinks and I have no recollection beyond that.\u201d Her next memory is coming briefly to consciousness in her own bed; he was there too with his fingers inside her. \u201cThen I woke the next morning, my head was banging so hard it was unbelievable and my body felt battered. He was lying next to me with no clothes on. I just couldn\u2019t work out how we ended up there.\u201d</p> <p>It is hard to build a solid picture of drug-facilitated rape \u2013 who does it, how, where, why, how often? There are too many gaps and so much guesswork. The body of research is still small and reliable data virtually impossible to collect. A national survey by Stamp Out Spiking suggests that <a href=\"https://stampoutspiking.org/stoptopps-national-survey-feedback/\">97% of spiking victims don\u2019t report it</a>, because they didn\u2019t realise until too late, felt there wasn\u2019t enough evidence and didn\u2019t expect to be believed. Then there are women who won\u2019t know that they are victims \u2013 there are examples, especially in marriages, of women being unaware it is happening over a period of years. On certain forums \u2013 such as Women\u2019s Aid and Reddit \u2013 women can be found airing their suspicions that they\u2019ve been drugged and raped by their husbands, and listing the warning signs they missed: \u201cforgetfulness\u201d, \u201cclumsiness\u201d, \u201cintermittent, unexplained pain and discomfort\u201d, \u201cfeeling like you have done a marathon in your sleep\u201d. The most recently available data on this from the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/natureofsexualassaultbyrapeorpenetrationenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2020\">2020 Crime Survey for England and Wales</a> found that 5% of rape victims suspected they had been drugged by the perpetrator, and this rose to 14% in cases where the attacker was a stranger.</p>    <p>From time to time, cases emerge that bring the issue into focus. More than 60 women have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/01/bill-cosby-lawsuit-sexual-assault\">alleged that Bill Cosby drugged and raped or sexually assaulted them</a>, a pattern of abuse said to have spanned most of his career as one of the US\u2019s best-loved comics. (He has always denied the allegations.) In Manchester, police believe, from video footage on his phone, that the PhD student Reynhard Sinaga drugged, raped or sexually assaulted more than 190 men between 2015 and 2017. Most of his victims were untraceable but Sinaga is now serving a minimum of 40 years for 159 counts of sexual offences against 48 men.</p> <p>In France, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, now a feminist hero, recently waived her anonymity in order to put drug-facilitated rape back in the spotlight. For more than a decade, the husband she loved and trusted was spiking her food and drink with anti-anxiety medication to render her unconscious, first raping her and allowing strangers to watch online, then inviting them to participate. Dozens of men, most within a 60km radius of their small town in south-eastern France, are said to have<strong> </strong>accepted Dominique Pelicot\u2019s offer while he filmed them, later filing the 20,000 photographs and videos he took neatly away in a folder on his computer called \u201cabuse\u201d.</p> <p>Has the case generated a deeper understanding of how and why? In court, it was heard that psychologists found \u201cno salient personality traits\u201d in Dominique Pelicot; he does not suffer any \u201cmental pathology or abnormality\u201d and has a \u201ccorrect relationship with reality\u201d. His use of pornography and search terms such as \u201casleep porn\u201d were highlighted, marking his tendency towards <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphilia#:~:text=A%20paraphilia%20is%20an%20experience,a%20legally%20consenting%20human%20partner.\">paraphilia</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnophilia\">somnophilia</a> (sexual interest in someone who is unconscious). Psychologists have linked somnophilia and the steep rise in pornography categories such as \u201cunconscious\u201d as the most logical extension of the internet porn explosion. Somnophilia, like online porn, is a one-way activity with no need to perform or please a partner who becomes an object, a receptacle with no reality or subjectivity to navigate.</p> <p>Whatever the role of online porn in the Pelicot case, drug-facilitated rape predates the internet by centuries. The medieval legal historian Gwen Seabourne highlights a case from 1292 in the south-west of England where a woman suffering from leg pain consulted her doctor, who administered a drink that incapacitated her, then raped her. In her sweeping history, America\u2019s Women: 400 Years of Dolls, Drudges, Helpmates, and Heroines, Gail Collins links women\u2019s growing independence in the late 1800s with the increasing use of drugs to control their sexuality. One doctor\u2019s records show that he visited a household two or three times a week in order to put a woman under anaesthetic so her husband could \u201chave sex\u201d with her. \u201cThroughout history, we see the use of drugs to facilitate unwanted sexual attacks,\u201d says Joanna Bourke, a British historian and the author of Rape: A History from 1860 to the Present. \u201cIn 19th-century Britain, drug-facilitated rape was a major concern, in the context of two drugs in particular \u2013 alcohol, much of which was adulterated so it was not clear how strong a drink was, and chloroform, which was a new drug, unregulated and widely available.\u201d<br><br>Bourke believes that drug-facilitated rape can only be understood through the deeply embedded \u201crape myths\u201d and male entitlement that have existed through history. \u201cOne of these is that \u2018some kinds of sexual violence are not really damaging\u2019,\u201d she says, \u201cthe belief that, \u2018She\u2019s unconscious, she won\u2019t feel it, she won\u2019t remember it, so it\u2019s not that bad and not really going to harm her.\u2019 Linked to this is the idea that if she\u2019s not fighting back, it\u2019s not really rape \u2013 and screaming and hitting isn\u2019t enough. There have to be wounds.\u201d</p>    <p>This is a clear feature of the Pelicot case, with many of the defendants insisting that they are not rapists. (One expressed his belief that rape was something that \u201chappens in the street\u201d in the style of, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want it, I\u2019ll hit you.\u201d) A psychologist told how Dominique Pelicot had trouble accepting the harm he had done, instead complaining that the trial had \u201cdestroyed his life\u201d, and that if he hadn\u2019t been arrested, \u201cI would still be happy, and she too \u2013 everything would have continued the same way.\u201d</p> <p>In another case, in Indianapolis in 2014, a man called David Wise who had drugged and sexually assaulted his wife for three years was sentenced to eight years of GPS-monitored home confinement, with the ability to leave for work and no required therapy. The judge told his former wife that she needed to forgive her ex-husband.</p> <p>Prosecuting drug-facilitated rape is rare and difficult. In many cases, including that of Sinaga and the Pelicot trial, it is only uncovered due to chance discoveries of video footage. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot knew something was very wrong; she suffered weight loss, hair loss, problems with her memory, unexplained gynaecological problems and difficulty moving her arm, but who would have imagined why? (Her husband dutifully drove her to medical appointments to get to the bottom of it.) Last year, Steven Evans from Greater Manchester was convicted of 37 offences, mostly sexual assault, against four women, after rendering them unconscious with a substance he called \u201cmagic\u201d. Again, this only came to light when one of his victims found videos on his old phone. (In the past, when she had complained of waking up with pain in her intimate body parts, he\u2019d laughed at her.)</p> <p>In Australia, in a case in 2001, a woman only discovered that her husband of 30 years was drugging and raping her when she found the videos taken with a hidden camera in their bedroom. She later told the court that she had feared she had cancer because of a host of mysterious gynaecological problems that required multiple surgeries.</p> <p>Without video evidence of the acts themselves, or perhaps CCTV footage of the victim completely incapacitated beforehand and unable to consent, or a witness to the substance being administered, these cases can be almost impossible to prosecute, says Nogah Ofer, a solicitor at the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice. \u201cToxicology is the main type of evidence if you give a sample quickly enough,\u201d she says, \u201cbut some of these drugs can leave your system very quickly.\u201d (Some can be picked up seven days later; others can be gone in less than 12 hours.) \u201cBy the time you\u2019ve come round, left wherever you are when you wake, maybe told a friend, worked out what has happened, it can be too late.\u201d Even when the drug is identified, depending on what it is, how do you prove you didn\u2019t take it recreationally?</p> <p>What is left is less than \u201cyour word against his\u201d, because victims have no clear memories, often no memory at all, no account to offer a jury. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime that people can get away with all the time,\u201d says Ofer, \u201cand I\u2019m sure they do.\u201d</p> <p>For Jo, the chances of any kind of justice look slim. \u201cWhen I woke and realised he was next to me, I had no idea what had happened,\u201d she says. \u201cHe tried to cuddle me. I can\u2019t remember what I said; I just needed to get him out of there. When he left, he said he\u2019d ring me later and asked: \u2018Can I not even have a kiss?\u2019 I felt ashamed, I felt cheap and so confused.\u201d</p> <p>A few days passed before she confided in her son, who urged her to report the rape. Five days after it had happened, Jo gave a statement to the police and had a forensic examination. (She isn\u2019t sure if her bloods were tested for drugs but assumes they would have left her system anyway.) The man was arrested and interviewed, and insisted that the sex had been consensual.</p> <p>\u201cSince then, every step has felt like a battle,\u201d Jo says. Police didn\u2019t confiscate the suspect\u2019s phone or laptop \u2013 but Jo had to hand in her own phone, apparently so that police could download the man\u2019s messages for evidence. (\u201cI\u2019m the victim. I\u2019ve barely told anyone, but I had to somehow explain to everyone why I didn\u2019t have a phone.\u201d) Earlier this year, she learned that the CPS would not be taking her case forward, a decision she is planning to challenge.</p> <p>\u201cIt has affected me in so many ways,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a weight on my shoulders all the time. I haven\u2019t told many people and putting up a front is exhausting. My job is very detailed, very pressured, so I\u2019ve decided to go part-time next year and that\u2019s a direct result of what happened. I\u2019m just so tired. I have always been a firm believer in the system, in justice, and this makes me question and doubt everything.\u201d</p> <p>The blank space from that evening is never far from her mind. \u201cI used to be confident and outgoing. I live in a really nice, safe, quiet neighbourhood, but I don\u2019t feel safe any more. When I go out, my senses are heightened, I\u2019m looking out for shadows. If I\u2019m anywhere social, I\u2019m on edge, holding on to my drink, but I\u2019m nervous at home, too.</p> <p>\u201cI wake in the night in my room, in the bed where it happened, and I have this feeling that I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on and what is coming next. Flashes of his face, of him being here pop into my head. Some people might think not knowing what happened to you is easier. For me, it isn\u2019t \u2013 and it\u2019s meant the odds are completely stacked in his favour.\u201d</p>",

One doctor\u2019s records show that he visited a household two or three times a week in order to put a woman under anaesthetic so her husband could \u201chave sex\u201d with her. \u201cThroughout history, we see the use of drugs to facilitate unwanted sexual attacks,\u201d says Joanna Bourke, a British historian and the author of Rape: A History from 1860 to the Present. \u201cIn 19th-century Britain, drug-facilitated rape was a major concern, in the context of two drugs in particular \u2013 alcohol, much of which was adulterated so it was not clear how strong a drink was, and chloroform, which was a new drug, unregulated and widely available.\u201d Bourke believes that drug-facilitated rape can only be understood through the deeply embedded \u201crape myths\u201d and male entitlement that have existed through history. \u201cOne of these is that \u2018some kinds of sexual violence are not really damaging\u2019,\u201d she says, \u201cthe belief that, \u2018She\u2019s unconscious, she won\u2019t feel it, she won\u2019t remember it, so it\u2019s not that bad and not really going to harm her.\u2019 Linked to this is the idea that if she\u2019s not fighting back, it\u2019s not really rape \u2013 and screaming and hitting isn\u2019t enough. There have to be wounds.\u201d This is a clear feature of the Pelicot case, with many of the defendants insisting that they are not rapists. (One expressed his belief that rape was something that \u201chappens in the street\u201d in the style of, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want it, I\u2019ll hit you.\u201d) A psychologist told how Dominique Pelicot had trouble accepting the harm he had done, instead complaining that the trial had \u201cdestroyed his life\u201d, and that if he hadn\u2019t been arrested, \u201cI would still be happy, and she too \u2013 everything would have continued the same way.\u201d In another case, in Indianapolis in 2014, a man called David Wise who had drugged and sexually assaulted his wife for three years was sentenced to eight years of GPS-monitored home confinement, with the ability to leave for work and no required therapy. The judge told his former wife that she needed to forgive her ex-husband. Prosecuting drug-facilitated rape is rare and difficult. In many cases, including that of Sinaga and the Pelicot trial, it is only uncovered due to chance discoveries of video footage. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot knew something was very wrong; she suffered weight loss, hair loss, problems with her memory, unexplained gynaecological problems and difficulty moving her arm, but who would have imagined why? (Her husband dutifully drove her to medical appointments to get to the bottom of it.) Last year, Steven Evans from Greater Manchester was convicted of 37 offences, mostly sexual assault, against four women, after rendering them unconscious with a substance he called \u201cmagic\u201d. Again, this only came to light when one of his victims found videos on his old phone. (In the past, when she had complained of waking up with pain in her intimate body parts, he\u2019d laughed at her.) In Australia, in a case in 2001, a woman only discovered that her husband of 30 years was drugging and raping her when she found the videos taken with a hidden camera in their bedroom. She later told the court that she had feared she had cancer because of a host of mysterious gynaecological problems that required multiple surgeries. Without video evidence of the acts themselves, or perhaps CCTV footage of the victim completely incapacitated beforehand and unable to consent, or a witness to the substance being administered, these cases can be almost impossible to prosecute, says Nogah Ofer, a solicitor at the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice. \u201cToxicology is the main type of evidence if you give a sample quickly enough,\u201d she says, \u201cbut some of these drugs can leave your system very quickly.\u201d (Some can be picked up seven days later; others can be gone in less than 12 hours.) \u201cBy the time you\u2019ve come round, left wherever you are when you wake, maybe told a friend, worked out what has happened, it can be too late.\u201d Even when the drug is identified, depending on what it is, how do you prove you didn\u2019t take it recreationally? What is left is less than \u201cyour word against his\u201d, because victims have no clear memories, often no memory at all, no account to offer a jury. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime that people can get away with all the time,\u201d says Ofer, \u201cand I\u2019m sure they do.\u201d For Jo, the chances of any kind of justice look slim. \u201cWhen I woke and realised he was next to me, I had no idea what had happened,\u201d she says. \u201cHe tried to cuddle me. I can\u2019t remember what I said; I just needed to get him out of there. When he left, he said he\u2019d ring me later and asked: \u2018Can I not even have a kiss?\u2019 I felt ashamed, I felt cheap and so confused.\u201d A few days passed before she confided in her son, who urged her to report the rape. Five days after it had happened, Jo gave a statement to the police and had a forensic examination. (She isn\u2019t sure if her bloods were tested for drugs but assumes they would have left her system anyway.) The man was arrested and interviewed, and insisted that the sex had been consensual. \u201cSince then, every step has felt like a battle,\u201d Jo says. Police didn\u2019t confiscate the suspect\u2019s phone or laptop \u2013 but Jo had to hand in her own phone, apparently so that police could download the man\u2019s messages for evidence. (\u201cI\u2019m the victim. I\u2019ve barely told anyone, but I had to somehow explain to everyone why I didn\u2019t have a phone.\u201d) Earlier this year, she learned that the CPS would not be taking her case forward, a decision she is planning to challenge. \u201cIt has affected me in so many ways,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a weight on my shoulders all the time. I haven\u2019t told many people and putting up a front is exhausting. My job is very detailed, very pressured, so I\u2019ve decided to go part-time next year and that\u2019s a direct result of what happened. I\u2019m just so tired. I have always been a firm believer in the system, in justice, and this makes me question and doubt everything.\u201d The blank space from that evening is never far from her mind. \u201cI used to be confident and outgoing. I live in a really nice, safe, quiet neighbourhood, but I don\u2019t feel safe any more. When I go out, my senses are heightened, I\u2019m looking out for shadows. If I\u2019m anywhere social, I\u2019m on edge, holding on to my drink, but I\u2019m nervous at home, too. \u201cI wake in the night in my room, in the bed where it happened, and I have this feeling that I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on and what is coming next. Flashes of his face, of him being here pop into my head. Some people might think not knowing what happened to you is easier. For me, it isn\u2019t \u2013 and it\u2019s meant the odds are completely stacked in his favour.\u201d",

The recovery has been accelerated by record tourism, which accounts for more than 20% of GDP and one in five jobs.</p> <p>Evidence of the remarkable turnaround was highlighted on Monday when Mitsotakis announced that in 2025 Greece will make an early repayment of \u20ac5bn of bailout-era loans given by the EU and IMF to keep the nation afloat.</p> <p>Describing the repayment as a sign of the country\u2019s fiscal recovery, he told a business conference in Athens that the move \u201cunderscores our confidence in public finances and reflects our commitment to fiscal discipline\u201d.</p> <p>Although Greece remains saddled with one of the highest debt-to-GDP rates on the continent, the finance ministry says that proceeds gained through successfully combatting tax evasion will also help reduce the burden.</p> <p>But the economic rebound remains a world away from the reality of Greeks left reeling from the austerity-driven budget cuts and tax hikes the nation was forced to endure to escape bankruptcy during the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a success story that cannot be translated into real-life gains for ordinary people on the street,\u201d said Yannis Koutsomitsis, a political analyst. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anxiety out there precisely because so many are finding it hard to make ends meet. Again and again you see it reflected in polls along with the general feeling that this is a government that has failed to grasp the severity of the situation.\u201d</p>",

Union leaders have accused the centre-right administration of failing to address escalating inflation and argue that the rising cost of living has corroded living standards to the point where many are finding it hard to survive. \u201cThe cost of living is sky high and our salaries rock-bottom, while high housing costs have left young people in a tragic position,\u201d said Yannis Panagopoulos, who heads the main private sector union, GSEE. Like other labour groups, GSEE accused the government of \u201crefusing to take any meaningful measures that would secure workers dignified living conditions\u201d. Low-income Greeks are forced to get by on a minimum wage of less than \u20ac900 (\u00a3750) a month in a country where retail, telecommunications and energy prices are some of the highest in Europe. The leftwing opposition has frequently claimed the less privileged are compelled to pay \u201cBritish prices on Bulgarian salaries\u201d. Mitsotakis recently pledged to increase the minimum wage to \u20ac950, but with housing costs also on the rise he has faced criticism that it is simply not enough in a society where the gap between rich and poor has grown in recent years. The general strike comes in stark contrast to the economic progress Greece has made since exiting a debt crisis that almost saw it fall out of the eurozone a decade ago. In praise that would have seemed unimaginable at the height of the crisis, credit ratings agencies have applauded the Mitsotakis government for fiscal reforms that have not only seen targets met and the country return to investment-grade status, but resulted in Greece outpacing other EU member states in terms of economic growth. The nation has posted one of the highest growth rates in Europe, with the EU predicting the Greek economy to grow by 2.1% in 2024, slightly below the 2.3% forecast by the IMF but many times higher than the weak overall 0.8% growth predicted by the Washington-based organisation for the eurozone as a whole. Unemployment has similarly fallen from a high of nearly 30% to 8.3%, the lowest in 20 years. The recovery has been accelerated by record tourism, which accounts for more than 20% of GDP and one in five jobs. Evidence of the remarkable turnaround was highlighted on Monday when Mitsotakis announced that in 2025 Greece will make an early repayment of \u20ac5bn of bailout-era loans given by the EU and IMF to keep the nation afloat. Describing the repayment as a sign of the country\u2019s fiscal recovery, he told a business conference in Athens that the move \u201cunderscores our confidence in public finances and reflects our commitment to fiscal discipline\u201d. Although Greece remains saddled with one of the highest debt-to-GDP rates on the continent, the finance ministry says that proceeds gained through successfully combatting tax evasion will also help reduce the burden. But the economic rebound remains a world away from the reality of Greeks left reeling from the austerity-driven budget cuts and tax hikes the nation was forced to endure to escape bankruptcy during the crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s a success story that cannot be translated into real-life gains for ordinary people on the street,\u201d said Yannis Koutsomitsis, a political analyst. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anxiety out there precisely because so many are finding it hard to make ends meet. Again and again you see it reflected in polls along with the general feeling that this is a government that has failed to grasp the severity of the situation.\u201d",

In 2024, he has continued to be proven right; a report by the EU\u2019s space programme has found it is \u201cvirtually certain\u201d that 2024 will be the hottest year on record. The scientists found global temperatures for the past 12 months were 1.62C greater than the 1850-1900 average, when humanity started to burn vast volumes of coal, oil and gas. The chart below shows just how quickly global surface temperatures have climbed, and this year is on track to be the first to hit 1.5C above preindustrial temperatures. \u2026 which we experienced as extreme heat And for some, it felt even hotter. Southern Europe is facing more and more heat stress days, defined as days that feel hotter than 32C, as the chart below shows. This data is from a report by Copernicus, which found that large parts of the area had two full months with \u201cstrong heat stress\u201d, reaching 60 days in total over the season. A few areas in Greece and western Turkey experienced \u201cstrong heat stress\u201d on every day of the summer, and about two months of \u201cvery strong heat stress\u201d. Though some have the luxury of air conditioning to escape the rocketing temperatures, our reporting this year found groups including migrant workers and prisoners faced stifling, dangerous heat with no respite. The oceans are heating, too Last year\u2019s marine heatwaves shocked scientists, as waters warmed to previously unthinkable levels. And it appears this was not an anomaly: in the first half of 2024, ocean surface heat levels soared above the heights they reached the previous year. \u2026 which we experienced as extreme rainfall Warmer waters have a higher rate of evaporation, which supercharges rain clouds and intensifies rainfall. It makes the devastating hurricanes such as those seen in the US this year far more likely. The chart below, based on Lancet data, shows that 61% of all global land during the period of 1994-2023 had an increase in extreme rainfall compared with the period between 1961 and 1990. \u2026 and drought While some parts of the world faced extremely heavy rain, others that rely on thriving rivers had their waterways dry up.

While the word \u201cColesworth\u201d is rarely used in official communication, it is regularly used by commentators and on social media to allege the big two supermarkets are more or less the same. The major supermarkets have been subject to multiple parliamentary and regulatory inquiries this year over their pricing practices and perceived lack of competition in the sector. This week, Woolworths executives were asked at an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission hearing whether they compete with their rival, or just price their products the same, given their own documentation refers to a strategy of \u201cneutralising Coles\u201d.

Research released by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines warned of extensive use of landmines across Myanmar following conflict that erupted after the 2021 military coup, with casualties recorded in every state and region except for Naypyidaw, the country\u2019s heavily fortified capital and centre of military power. Myanmar suffered more casualties last year than Syria, which had ranked worst in the world for the past three years. Ukraine and Afghanistan accounted for the third and fourth highest number of casualties globally. Landmine use has significantly increased in Myanmar as conflict has spread across the country after the military\u2019s seizure of power in February 2021. After the coup, many civilians took up arms and formed people\u2019s defence forces to fight for the return of democracy and an end to military violence. Older, ethnic armed groups that have long sought greater autonomy have also fought against the junta, sometimes in coordination with newer groups. The report, Landmine Monitor 2024, said landmines were used by both the military junta and armed groups that are fighting against it. It cited several incidents where military landmines reportedly caused civilian casualties, including among children, and said there is evidence the military continues to use civilians as \u201cguides\u201d to walk ahead of its soldiers in mine-affected areas, effectively using them as human shields. The research also referenced reports the military has threatened farmers that they must pay for antipersonnel mines detonated by their livestock. In one case, soldiers demanded the owner of a cow injured by antipersonnel mines pay 1.5 million kyats ($714.97). The report also reviewed cases where people\u2019s defence forces and ethnic armed groups have allegedly used landmines, injuring and killing civilians. Increasingly, explosive devices were being left in military-controlled urban areas, often disguised in black plastic bags, said Dr Yeshua Moser-Puangsuwan, a researcher for the report. \u201cThey are picked up by either garbage collectors or people salvaging through trash to try and find something to resell,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "The governor of the Northern Mariana Islands says an $800m US military upgrade plan which includes a new airfield in the Pacific territory \u201chas to happen\u201d amid concern over China\u2019s recent missile tests in the region. Tinian, home to about 3,500 people, is one of the three main islands of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, an unincorporated US territory. During the second world war, the US launched a nuclear bomb against Japan from Tinian, and now a major rehabilitation of a deserted airfield and other military upgrades are under way on the island. The development is part of a broader strategy by Washington to beef up its Indo-Pacific security presence amid growing tensions in the region. \u201cThe world is changing in the Indo-Pacific and we need to acknowledge that. We need to face reality,\u201d said Arnold Palacios, governor of the Northern Mariana Islands, who added the defence base development on Tinian \u201chas to happen\u201d. \u201cThat needs to happen with the way the situation is,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cDo I wish that we don\u2019t have to have military bases? I think everybody in this world would like to see peace, but the best deterrent is to have a good defense and to be prepared.\u201d Palacios pointed to concerns over China\u2019s recent missile test over the Pacific Ocean and deployment of forces around the waters of Taiwan. \u201cThat\u2019s the first chain of violence. We\u2019re the second chain of violence. If something happens, we will be impacted,\u201d he said. It is not yet clear how the incoming Trump administration will adjust Biden\u2019s Indo-Pacific strategy, but recent appointments have suggested a hawkish policy towards China. The Indo-Pacific plan, released in 2022, seeks to strengthen the position of the US in the region amid a \u201cchanging strategic landscape\u201d, specifically the \u201cmounting challenge\u201d posed by China. Located about 2,414km (1,500 miles) south of Tokyo, Tinian has an area of 101 sq km (39 sq miles). During the second world war, it served as a base for B-29 Superfortress bombers that took part in the bombing of Tokyo in March 1945 and the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Tinian is known in the region for its pristine beaches, cattle ranches and hot peppers, which grow abundantly throughout the island. It is dotted with historical sites that attract tourists interested in the second world war. Over the next few years, the US Department of Defense plans to invest close to $800m in Tinian to build up defense operations. Work began in 2022 and the first phase of the project, which includes the updated runway, is due to be completed in 2025. The US air force is restoring over 1.85m sq metres (20m sq feet) of degraded pavement to create \u201ca rejuvenated runway\u201d, said Lt Cmdr Michelle Tucker, spokesperson for the Joint Task Force-Micronesia. The taskforce is a newly formed command overseeing military operations in the Pacific. Tucker said air force engineers are conducting \u201crehabilitation work\u201d on Tinian to allow the US to \u201crapidly deploy and sustain forces in diverse environments\u201d. Neighbouring island Guam is at the core of the US military\u2019s Indo-Pacific strategy and home to air force, naval and marine bases. Tucker said the Northern Marianas Islands are part of the US and \u201ccritical to US defense and power projection across the region\u201d. Given Tinian\u2019s strategic location, Tucker said the island is considered a backup site to \u201cmeet mission requirements\u201d for the US military to support bases in Guam or other Pacific locations. \u201cThe construction work on Tinian is part of a broader initiative to expand facilities and general port and airport options throughout the Indo-Pacific region,\u201d Tucker said. The US is leasing two-thirds of the land on Tinian for defense and military development. In addition to the $384m airport rehabilitation project, the defense department has also contracted $409m for operations and training developments including equipment, facilities and other related projects to support the military on the island. The defense department also plans to build a training site for combat skills on Tinian. Tucker said a proposed military training complex will include multiple ranges, landing zones and base camps to provide service members realistic joint combat training in a tropical environment. The US is also exploring possibilities for waterfront and wharf improvements at Tinian harbour berths \u201cto accommodate various navy vessels\u201d, Tucker said. Michael Walsh, visiting researcher at the Lasky Center for Transatlantic Studies at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, said it made sense for the US military to build up its capability on Tinian as part of a \u201cnetwork\u201d across the region. \u201cWhat is planned has the potential of being very valuable in terms of strategic signalling and deterrence effect,\u201d he said, while also noting it \u201ccould also be easily neutralised by China in the event of the outbreak of a major confrontation\u201d. Palacios said defense development on Tinian is needed in the current environment. \u201cWe hope that things will get dialled down and everybody finally figures out that we need to all get along in the region. We cannot afford to be afraid.\u201d",

The Los Angeles city council on Tuesday unanimously passed a \u201csanctuary city\u201d ordinance to protect immigrants living in the city, a policy that would prohibit the use of city resources and personnel to carry out federal immigration enforcement, Reuters reports. The move by the Southern California city, the second most populated city in the US after New York City, follows President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s vow to carry out mass deportations of immigrants. The ordinance codifies the protection of migrants in municipal law. Council member Paul Krekorian said the measure addresses \u201cthe need to ensure that our immigrant community here in Los Angeles understands that we understand their fear.\u201d Linda McMahon has been a constant presence in Donald Trump\u2019s tumultuous orbit, serving in his first administration and supporting his presidential campaigns. Now he\u2019s chosen her to serve as Education secretary. McMahon chaired America First Action, a super PAC that backed Trump\u2019s reelection campaign in 2020. He lost to Democrat Joe Biden, and McMahon helped start the America First Policy Institute to continue advocating for Trump\u2019s agenda and prepare for a potential return to the White House. McMahon is married to Vince McMahon, whose father was a prominent professional wrestling promoter. They followed him into the business, founding their own company that\u2019s now known as World Wrestling Entertainment, or WWE. It became a juggernaut in the industry and American culture. When Trump was the star of the reality show \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d he made an appearance at Wrestlemania in 2007. The billionaire entertainment mogul participated in an elaborately scripted feud that ended with Trump shaving off Vince McMahon\u2019s hair in the middle of the ring. Linda McMahon stepped down from her position as WWE\u2019s chief executive to enter politics. She ran twice for a US Senate seat in Connecticut, but lost in 2010 to Richard Blumenthal and in 2012 to Chris Murphy. McMahon provided $6m to help Trump\u2019s candidacy after he secured the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. McMahon served on the Connecticut Board of Education for a year starting in 2009. She told lawmakers at the time that she had a lifelong interest in education and once planned to become a teacher, a goal that fell aside after her marriage. She also spent years on the board of trustees for Sacred Heart University in Connecticut. McMahon is seen as a relative unknown in education circles, though she has expressed support for charter schools and school choice. In October, McMahon was named in a new lawsuit involving the WWE. The suit alleges that she and other leaders of the company allowed the sexual abuse of young boys at the hands of a ringside announcer, former WWE ring crew chief Melvin Phillips Jr. The complaint specifically alleges that the McMahons knew about the abuse and failed to stop it. Bloomberg reports that Trump plans to interview former federal reserve governor Kevin Warsh and billionaire Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan for the role of treasury secretary on Wednesday. CNN reported earlier that Trump could name his pick for secretary on Wednesday. Since 2021, McMahon has served as Washington DC-based thinktank America First Policy Institute\u2019s board chairperson and chair of its Center for the American Worker. A former Senate candidate in Connecticut, McMahon is also the chair and chief executive of Cantor Fitzgerald and a former executive of the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which she co-founded with her husband, Vince McMahon. In October, McMahon was named in a new lawsuit involving the WWE. The suit alleges that she and other leaders of the company allowed the sexual abuse of young boys at the hands of a ringside announcer, former WWE ring crew chief Melvin Phillips Jr. The complaint specifically alleges that the McMahons knew about the abuse and failed to stop it. An attorney for the McMahons told USA TODAY Sports that the allegations are \u201cfalse claims\u201d stemming from reporting that the couple deems \u201cabsurd, defamatory and utterly meritless\u201d. Trump has just confirmed that his nomination for education secretary is Linda McMahon. McMahon, who had been in the running for commerce secretary, headed up the Small Business Administration in Trump\u2019s first administration and was a major donor and early supporter of the Republican president-elect when he first ran for the White House almost a decade ago. The co-founder and former CEO of the WWE professional wrestling franchise, she resigned from the SBA in 2019 to lead the pro-Trump spending group America First Action. She also chairs the America First Policy Institute, a Trump-friendly think tank. In his statement, Trump said: It is my great honor to announce that Linda McMahon, former Administrator of the Small Business Administration, will be the United States Secretary of Education. For the past four years, as the Chair of the Board at the America First Policy Institute (AFPI), Linda has been a fierce advocate for Parents\u2019 Rights, working hard at both AFPI and America First Works (AFW) to achieve Universal School Choice in 12 States, giving children the opportunity to receive an excellent Education, regardless of zip code or income. As Secretary of Education, Linda will fight tirelessly to expand \u201cChoice\u201d to every State in America, and empower parents to make the best Education decisions for their families. Mexico\u2019s top economy officials on Tuesday downplayed concerns about trade talks with Donald Trump\u2019s administration, saying the potential impact on American companies could give the incoming US president second thoughts about levying massive tariffs. Trump campaigned on a pledge to roll out a slew of tariffs, including for firms that had moved operations to Mexico, in a bid to restore jobs in the US Economists have warned that such tariffs would amount to a serious blow to Mexico\u2019s export-dependent economy and have warned of a lesser hit to the US economy. \u201cMexico\u2019s negotiation power is relevant,\u201d Mexico\u2019s economy minister, Marcelo Ebrard, said at a press conference on Tuesday, pointing to the number of multinational firms that have set up shop in his country. \u201cAny action that you take to put at risk (the US-Mexico trade relationship) means thousands of companies\u201d will be impacted, Ebrard said. \u201cThere\u2019s hardly an important US company that doesn\u2019t have money here.\u201d Trump is expected to name Linda McMahon as education secretary, CNN reports, citing four sources familiar with the matter, putting the former pro-wrestling mogul at the helm of a department Trump has proposed abolishing. McMahon, who had been in the running for commerce secretary, headed up the Small Business Administration in Trump\u2019s first administration and was a major donor and early supporter of the Republican president-elect when he first ran for the White House almost a decade ago. The co-founder and former CEO of the WWE professional wrestling franchise, she resigned from the SBA in 2019 to lead the pro-Trump spending group America First Action. She also chairs the America First Policy Institute, a Trump-friendly think tank. Trump tapped her to co-lead a transition team formed to help vet personnel and draft policy ahead of the 5 November election. McMahon had been in the mix to head the Commerce Department, but Trump on Tuesday instead chose her transition team co-leader \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald Chief Executive Howard Lutnick \u2013 for that post. Now she will lead an agency Trump said on the campaign trail that he would abolish, although he likely lacks authority to do it without congressional approval. Businesses are bracing for the economic impact of a second Trump presidency, which, if his campaign promises are to be believed, will mean tariffs across nearly all imports to the US, especially those from China. But amid the gloom over the spectre of a renewed global trade war, some manufacturers may be looking to those who already have a playbook on dealing with aggressive US levies, such as China\u2019s solar companies. China all but owns the global solar market. Its share in every stage of the solar panel manufacturing chain exceeds 80%, according to the International Energy Agency. Last year it exported a record high of 227 gigawatts (GW) of solar panels \u2013 more than the entire installed solar capacity of the United States. The Guardian\u2019s Amy Hawkins and Helen Davidson report: California voters have rejected a ballot measure that would have raised state\u2019s minimum wage to a national high of US$18 per hour, the Associated Press reports. San Francisco Mayor London Breed lost her re-election race to Levi Strauss heir Daniel Lurie. The Associated Press called the race Tuesday. In conceding the race to Lurie, Breed, 50, pledged a smooth transition for the incoming mayor. \u201cBeing Mayor of San Francisco has been the greatest honor of my lifetime. I\u2019m beyond grateful to our residents for the opportunity to serve the City that raised me,\u201d she said in a statement last week. Breed\u2019s victory six years ago as the city\u2019s first Black female mayor \u2014 who grew up poor and in public housing \u2014 showed that no dream was impossible in the progressive, compassionate and equitable city. She won election as mayor in June 2018 to serve out the remainder of Ed Lee\u2019s term, who died suddenly while in office. The authorization would be a reversal of an Obama-era policy revived by Biden in 2022 that banned the transfer and use of US antipersonnel landmines outside the Korean Peninsula, the Washington Post reports. An official, cited in the story, said Ukraine had committed to not using the mines in densely populated areas. The Washington Post reports that US President Joe Biden, \u201chas authorized the provision of antipersonnel land mines to Ukraine\u201d. It cites two unnamed US officials. US president-elect Donald Trump will name who he has picked to be Treasury secretary as soon as Wednesday, CNN reported, citing two sources familiar with the matter. No one has been has been chosen yet for the role, CNN also reported. The narrowly trailing Republican candidate in the race for a North Carolina Supreme Court seat formally requested a recount on Tuesday, with barely 600 votes separating him from the Democratic incumbent. Jefferson Griffin, a Court of Appeals judge, sent the request before a noon deadline, marking the lone statewide race where a recount is poised to occur. Recounts for several single- or multi-county races also have been requested, including five General Assembly races. Ballots will be run again through tabulator machines. Associate Justice Allison Riggs led Tuesday by 625 votes over Griffin, as election officials in all but two small counties from the state\u2019s 100 counties have finalized their work from last Friday\u2019s count meetings. Griffin led after election night by roughly 10,000 votes, but the margin dwindled last week as county election boards reviewed tens of thousands of provisional and absentee ballots and added voting choices of those that qualified for counting to the totals. More than 5.5m ballots have been cast in the Riggs-Griffin race. The State Board of Elections said in a news release that most of the 100 counties will begin their recounts on Wednesday and should be completed by 27 November. The board is slated to meet 26 November to consider final counts and certify results, but a Supreme Court race certification could be considered at a later date, spokesperson Pat Gannon said. Trump is interviewing candidates for the role of FBI director, incoming vice-president JD Vance said Tuesday in the clearest indication yet that the new administration is looking to replace current director Christopher Wray. In a social media post that was later deleted, according to the Associated Press, Vance defended himself from criticism over his absence from a Senate vote at which a judicial nominee of President Joe Biden was confirmed by saying that at the time of the vote, \u201cI was meeting with President Trump to interview multiple positions for our government, including for FBI Director.\u201d \u201cI tend to think it\u2019s more important to get an FBI director who will dismantle the deep state than it is for Republicans to lose a vote 49-46 rather than 49-45,\u201d he added on X. \u201cBut that\u2019s just me.\u201d Vance was referring to the Senate vote Monday to confirm Embry J. Kidd, a Biden nominee to the US court of appeals for the 11th Circuit, a vote that he and several other Republican senators missed. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment. Trump announced a short while ago that he has chosen television personality and surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz to serve as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a wide-reaching agency with annual spending of $2.6tn. Trump, who endorsed Oz in his unsuccessful run in Pennsylvania for the US Senate in 2022, said he would work closely with Robert F Kennedy Jr., who was nominated to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump said the pair would take on \u201cthe illness industrial complex, and all the horrible chronic diseases left in its wake\u201d as well as cutting what he called waste and fraud. \u201cOur broken healthcare System harms everyday Americans, and crushes our Country\u2019s budget,\u201d Trump said in a statement. The agency runs Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people aged 65 or older and disabled people. The office also oversees Medicaid, the state-based health insurance program for low-income people, which is jointly funded by states and the federal government. The two programs provide health insurance for over 140 million Americans. It also handles much of the enrolment in income-based government-subsidized health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Trump and other Republicans have previously tried to repeal the law but now say they only seek to overhaul it. Oz was a regular Fox News commentator during the Covid-19 pandemic and a proponent of unproven treatments for Covid-19 including hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug whose use against the disease was also backed by Trump. Oz challenged the Biden administration\u2019s Covid-19 pandemic policies on social media, including mask policies, saying they ignored the science and were based on missing data. In 2020, he was a proponent of expanding Medicare Advantage plans in which insurers manage healthcare benefits paid for by the government to all Americans who were not enrolled in Medicaid in a column published in Forbes magazine. News of the appointment pushed shares of insurer Humana up 1.8% at $282.75. Humana is a provider of private Medicare Advantage plans. Trump promised during his campaign not to cut Medicare but is expected to let federal subsidies for Medicaid expire at the end of 2025. After RFK Jr. was named to the job last week, Oz told Fox News that he knew the HHS secretary nominee personally. The position is subject to Senate confirmation. In case you missed this news earlier: The Associated Press reports that, according to a lawyer, an unauthorized person gained access to a file containing confidential testimony from women who have made allegations about former Rep. Matt Gaetz, Donald Trump\u2019s pick to become the next attorney general: The Associated Press reports that attorneys involved in a civil case brought by a Gaetz associate were notified this week that an unauthorized person accessed a file shared between lawyers that included unredacted depositions from a woman who has said Gaetz had sex with her when she was 17, and a second woman who says she saw the encounter, according to attorney Joel Leppard. Gaetz has denied all the allegations, and the Justice Department ended its sex trafficking investigation without any criminal charges against him. A lawyer who has represented Gaetz said he would not answer any questions when reached Tuesday by The Associated Press. The apparent breach comes as Gaetz is facing intense scrutiny over the allegations threatening to complicate his path to be confirmed as the nation\u2019s top federal law enforcement officer. Several Republicans in the Senate have expressed concern about his nomination or refused to say publicly yet whether they will support him. The files the person was able to access are part of a defamation case filed by a Gaetz associate against Gaetz\u2019s onetime political ally Joel Greenberg, who pleaded guilty in 2021 to sex trafficking of a minor, and admitted that he had paid at least one underage girl to have sex with him and other men. The email notifying the lawyers about the apparent hack says a person named \u201cAltam Beezley\u201d downloaded the files, and when an attorney emailed the person to ask them to identify themselves, the email was returned because the email address was not found. The apparent breach was first reported Tuesday by The New York Times. Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he was not reconsidering the nomination of former congressman Matt Gaetz as attorney general, Reuters reports. Gaetz, 42, who was investigated by the justice department for nearly three years over sex trafficking allegations involving a 17-year-old girl, was tapped by Trump on Wednesday to run the agency when he returns to the White House in January. Trump, asked if he was reconsidering the nomination, replied: \u201cNo.\u201d Trump did not respond when asked how far he was willing to go to get Gaetz confirmed. Donald Trump has continued to choose loyalists for his upcoming administration, tapping TV personality and purveyor of health misinformation Dr Mehmet Oz to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Here\u2019s where things stand: Howard Lutnick will be Trump\u2019s pick for commerce secretary for his second administration, according to a report. Lutnick is the president-elect\u2019s transition co-chair and is the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, the New York investment bank, and a longtime friend of Trump. Sean Duffy has been nominated to be Trump\u2019s transportation secretary in his next administration. The former congressman is co-host of The Bottom Line show on Fox Business. Duffy served in Congress from 2011 until 2019. Before being elected to national public office, he was district attorney for Ashland county, Wisconsin, from 2002 to 2008 and previously had a reality TV show role. Trump is \u201ccalling senators\u201d to pressure them to confirm Matt Gaetz as his attorney general for the incoming administration, according to a report. This is occurring as the US House ethics committee is expected to discuss next steps in its investigation into Gaetz, the now former Florida congressman, tomorrow. Nearly 100 House Democrats have signed a letter urging the House ethics committee to release its report into Matt Gaetz. \u201cThe United States Senate has a constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on presidential nominees, and it is critical that senators have all the information necessary to consider Mr Gaetz\u2019s nomination,\u201d the letter reads. New York prosecutors in Trump\u2019s criminal case said they oppose dismissing the president-elect\u2019s election hush-money case as his sentencing looms \u2013 but they expressed some openness to delaying the conclusion of the case until after his impending second term. The prosecutors said in a letter today that they plan on fighting Trump\u2019s push for the dismissal of the criminal case, following his presidential election win over Kamala Harris. They said the Manhattan court should set a timeline for Trump\u2019s expected motion to dismiss, which they \u201cintend to oppose\u201d. The scheduled 26 November sentencing appears poised for adjournment. An unidentified hacker has reportedly accessed a file shared among lawyers representing clients who have provided damaging testimony regarding Matt Gaetz, the New York Times is reporting, citing a person with knowledge of the activity. Apparently, the computer file consisted of 24 exhibits, including testimony by a woman in which she says she had sex with Gaetz in 2017 when she was 17, as well as corroborating testimony by a second woman who said that she witnessed the encounter. Trump has joined his new BFF, billionaire Elon Musk, for a planned rocket launch by the entrepreneur\u2019s SpaceX company at the aerospace base in south-east Texas later today. Weather conditions permitting, this will be the sixth test flight into space for SpaceX\u2019s Starship rocket. The test launch is planned for 5pm ET, with a half-hour window for launch. Soon-to-be senate leader John Thune has led Republicans in the Senate in their effort to block confirmations of qualified judicial nominees proposed by the Biden administration. On Monday, Republicans dragged out the floor process in an effort to delay the confirmation process, after Donald Trump directed his Republican senators to \u201cshow up and hold the line\u201d against confirmations. The White House noted that this is a reversal in stance for Thune. \u201cDuring the equivalent time under the Trump Administration \u2013 after President-elect Biden had won the most votes of any candidate in American history \u2013 Senator John Thune forcefully argued that continuing to confirm President Trump\u2019s judicial nominees should be a \u2018top priority,\u2019 stressing that \u2018confirming good judges is one of our most important responsibilities as senators\u2019 and that \u2018it\u2019s a responsibility I take very seriously,\u2019\u201d said White House spokesperson Andrew Bates. \u201cSenator Thune was correct in 2020 when he said senators have every urgent reason to continue working together in good faith to staff the federal bench. There is no excuse for choosing partisanship over enforcing the rule of law.\u201d Despite launching a governors\u2019 group focused on safeguarding democracy during Donald Trump\u2019s second term, Governor Jared Polis of Colorado said the coalition wasn\u2019t about Trump, a president he\u2019s willing to work with on several key issues. In recent days, Polis, a Democrat, also praised Trump\u2019s pick of Robert F Kennedy Jr for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, an unexpected endorsement from a governor of a blue state that bucked the national trend and largely moved to the left in the election. Polis has some ideas as to why the state didn\u2019t shift to the right like most of the country. The state\u2019s Democratic-controlled government has passed policies that have improved lives, he said, and Colorado voters have a higher than average education level, tilting them toward Democrats. Polis and the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, last week announced Governors Safeguarding Democracy, seeking to defend democratic institutions. The group has been described as an effort to oppose Trump administration policies, but Polis said it was not specifically in response to a Trump presidency. Then on Thursday, Polis praised RFK\u2019s nomination. \u201cI\u2019m excited by the news that the President-Elect will appoint @RobertKennedyJr to @HHSGov,\u201d Polis wrote on X after the staffing announcement. \u201cHe helped us defeat vaccine mandates in Colorado in 2019 and will help make America healthy again by shaking up HHS and FDA. I hope he leans into personal choice on vaccines rather than bans (which I think are terrible, just like mandates) but what I\u2019m most optimistic about is taking on big pharma and the corporate ag oligopoly to improve our health.\u201d Polis\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to questions about what Polis and Kennedy had worked on together in 2019 in Colorado. The Guardian spoke with Polis before the RFK Jr tweets, about Colorado and what Democrats nationally could learn from a state that didn\u2019t move toward Trump. Read more: Donald Trump has joined Elon Musk for the sixth test of SpaceX\u2019s giant Starship rocket from Texas. Trump\u2019s attendance underscores his increasingly close friendship with Musk, whom he has tapped to co-lead a new Department of Government Efficiency with the former Republican presidential candidate, Vivek Ramaswamy. Follow the Guardian\u2019s SpaceX launch liveblog here: Dr Oz has built a long career promoting health misinformation. During his unsuccessful campaign for senator of Pennsylvania, doctors and researchers called for him to be stripped of his medical credentials over his promotion of unproven treatments, including touting the use of hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug, to treat Covid-19 without scientific evidence. Timothy Caulfield, the Canada Research Chair in Health Law and Policy at the University of Alberta, wrote in the Scientific American: Despite facing mounting criticism for his embrace of harmful pseudoscience and the provision of evidence-free health advice, Oz remains connected to Columbia University\u2019s medical school and is a licensed physician. In 2014, he was called in front of the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection over misleading statements he made on his popular television show, the Dr. Oz Show. During the hearing one senator went so far as to tell \u201cAmerica\u2019s Doctor\u201d (anointed thus by Oprah) that \u201cthe scientific community is almost monolithic against you.\u201d And while Oz has not been officially sanctioned by a regulatory body\u2014the Federal Trade Commission, for example, has gone after fraudsters who have appeared on his show, but the agency hasn\u2019t taken direct action against him\u2014that doesn\u2019t mean he shouldn\u2019t be disciplined. His affiliation with Columbia and the fact he still has a license seems especially baffling at a time when the spread of health misinformation has been recognized as one of this era\u2019s most challenging health policy issues. Given all that he has done to promote science-free medicine, how has Oz\u2019s licence not been revoked? In his announcement naming Dr Mehmet Oz as his nominee to lead the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services, Donald Trump has also suggested that these massive health programs that serve more than 140m people could see steep cuts. Oz \u201cwill also cut waste and fraud within our Country\u2019s most expensive Government Agency, which is a third of our Nation\u2019s Healthcare spend, and a quarter of our entire National Budget,\u201d Trump said in his announcement. Republicans have been pushing to further privatize Medicare, a program for elderly people and some people with disabilities, despite complaints from patients and providers that the existing privatized Medicare Advantage program costs taxpayers more, and provides worse care. President-elect Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that he has nominated Dr Mehmet Oz to serve as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator. \u201cAmerica is facing a healthcare Crisis, and there may be no Physician more qualified and capable than Dr. Oz to Make America Healthy Again\u201d Trump said in a statement. Trump added: \u201cHe is an eminent Physician, Heart Surgeon, Inventor, and World-Class Communicator, who has been at the forefront of healthy living for decades. Dr. Oz will work closely with Robert F Kennedy Jr. to take on the illness industrial complex, and all the horrible chronic diseases left in its wake.\u201d Oz ran an unsuccessful campaign for senator in Pennsylvania in 2022. President-elect Donald Trump is urging Republican senators to stop the confirmation of judges before he takes office in January. \u201cThe Democrats are trying to stack the Courts with Radical Left Judges on their way out the door\u201d Trump wrote in a social media post on Tuesday. \u201cRepublican Senators need to Show Up and Hold the Line \u2013 No more Judges confirmed before Inauguration Day!\u201d. This comes as Senate Democrats held a late-night vote on Monday to confirm Joe Biden\u2019s nominees to the federal judiciary. Meanwhile, Joe Biden is at the G20 leaders summit in Rio de Janeiro and finally appeared in the leaders\u2019 photo after missing the first one. US officials previously stated that \u201clogistical issues\u201d were to blame for why the president missed out on the first group shot on Monday. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni also missed the first group photo. But today, they had a reshoot, and this time Biden was given a spot near the middle of the front row of the assembled world leaders. Here are some of the photos: Donald Trump has confirmed that he is on his way to Texas for a SpaceX rocket launch, scheduled for later today. \u201cI\u2019m heading to the Great State of Texas to watch the launch of the largest object ever to be elevated, not only to Space, but simply by lifting off the ground\u201d Trump said in a social media post. He added: \u201cGood luck to Elon Musk and the Great Patriots involved in this incredible project!\u201d Vice president-elect JD Vance said that he and Donald Trump were interviewing candidates for the FBI director position on Monday evening. In a post on social media, Vance said that he was meeting with Trump to interview multiple positions for their government on Monday evening, including the role of FBI director. The post came in response to criticism regarding his absence from a Senate vote on Monday night to confirm nominees for the federal judiciary. \u201cWhen this 11th Circuit vote happened, I was meeting with President Trump to interview multiple positions for our government, including for FBI Director\u201d Vance said. \u201cI tend to think it\u2019s more important to get an FBI director who will dismantle the deep state than it is for Republicans to lose a vote 49-46 rather than 49-45. But that\u2019s just me.\u201d Donald Trump has officially chosen Howard Lutnick, the president-elect\u2019s transition co-chair, to serve as commerce secretary for his second administration. Lutnick, who has been a longtime friend of Trump, is the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald. In a post on Truth Social, the former president wrote that he was \u201cthrilled\u201d to announce Lutnick as his commerce secretary. He stated that Lutnick will \u201clead our Tariff and Trade agenda\u201d and will also have direct responsibility for the office of the US trade representative. In his role as co-chair of the Trump-Vance transition team, Trump said that Lutnick \u201ccreated the most sophisticated process and system to assist us in creating the greatest Administration America has ever seen\u201d. The statement also describes Lutnick as having been a \u201cdynamic force on Wall Street for more than 30 years\u201d. Vice president-elect JD Vance is said to be arranging meetings this week on Capitol Hill between some of Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees and Republican senators who will be involved with the confirmation process. According to CNN, Vance is expected attend some of the meetings too, including those with former representative Matt Gaetz, who Trump has selected as his nominee for attorney general, and former Fox News host Pete Hegseth, whom Trump has selected as the head of the Department of Defense. Louisiana Republican Senator John Kennedy also told CNN that he plans to meet with Gaetz and Vance on Wednesday. A spokesperson for the Trump-Vance Transition said in a statement to the network that Gaetz and Hegseth, as well as Representatives Doug Collins and Elise Stefanik, will \u201cbegin their meetings this week with additional Hill visits to continue after the Thanksgiving recess\u201d. Collins has been chosen by Trump to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs while Stefanik has been selected to be the US ambassador to the United Nations. The House Democrats\u2019 press conference wrapped up a little earlier with the minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, trying to instill confidence that they can provide effective resistance to Republican extremism. \u201cHouse Democrats are going to protect our institutions, our values and the norms that have made America the greatest country in the history of the world and the greatest democracy in the history of the world,\u201d he said, as he signed off at the end of the event. Moments before, congressman Ted Lieu, re-elected today as vice chair of the House Democratic caucus, warned the public not to pay attention to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign trail attempts to distance himself from Project 2025, a rightwing thinktank blueprint for the incoming administration. \u201cYou are watching Project 2025 being implemented,\u201d Lieu said, vowing that Democrats are \u201cgoing to continue telling the truth\u201d about Trump policy and plans. And congressman Joe Neguse of Colorado said it would be unconstitutional for the incoming Trump administration to set about \u201cdeleting agencies\u201d as it tries to shrink the federal government. Hello, US politics live blog readers, it\u2019s another action-packed news day and we are in the midst of it all so stick with us for all the developments as they happen. Here\u2019s where things stand: New York prosecutors in Donald Trump\u2019s criminal case said moments ago that they oppose dismissing the president-elect\u2019s election hush-money case as his sentencing looms \u2013 but they expressed some openness to delaying the conclusion of the case until after his impending second term. In the latest court filing today, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office said Trump\u2019s forthcoming presidency is not grounds for dropping a case that has already been tried, adding that \u201cconsideration must be given\u201d to potentially freezing the case until after Trump is out of office. The prosecutors said in a letter today that they plan on fighting Trump\u2019s push for the dismissal of the criminal case, following his presidential election win over Kamala Harris. They said the Manhattan court should set a timeline for Trump\u2019s expected motion to dismiss, which they \u201cintend to oppose\u201d. The scheduled 26 November sentencing appears poised for adjournment. Nearly 100 House Democrats have signed a letter urging the House ethics committee to release its report into Matt Gaetz. \u201cThe United States Senate has a constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on presidential nominees, and it is critical that senators have all the information necessary to consider Mr Gaetz\u2019s nomination,\u201d the letter reads. Howard Lutnick will be Donald Trump\u2019s pick for commerce secretary for his second administration, according to a report. Lutnick is the president-elect\u2019s transition co-chair and is the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, the New York investment bank, and a longtime friend of Trump. An unidentified hacker has reportedly accessed a file shared among lawyers representing clients who have provided damaging testimony regarding Matt Gaetz, the New York Times is reporting, citing a person with knowledge of the activity. Apparently, the computer file consisted of 24 exhibits, including testimony by a woman in which she says she had sex with Gaetz in 2017 when she was 17, as well as corroborating testimony by a second woman who said that she witnessed the encounter. Trump will join his new BFF, billionaire Elon Musk, for a planned rocket launch by the entrepreneur\u2019s SpaceX company at the aerospace base in south-east Texas later today. Weather conditions permitting, this will be the sixth test flight into space for SpaceX\u2019s Starship rocket. The test launch is planned for 5pm ET, with a half-hour window for launch. Trump is \u201ccalling senators\u201d to pressure them to confirm Matt Gaetz as his attorney general for the incoming administration, according to a report. This is occurring as the US House ethics committee is expected to discuss next steps in its investigation into Gaetz, the now former Florida congressman, tomorrow. Sean Duffy has been nominated to be Trump\u2019s transportation secretary in his next administration. The former congressman is co-host of The Bottom Line show on Fox Business. Duffy served in Congress from 2011 until 2019. Before being elected to national public office, he was district attorney for Ashland county, Wisconsin, from 2002 to 2008 and previously had a reality TV show role. New York prosecutors said moments ago that they oppose dismissing president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s hush-money case as his sentencing looms \u2013 but they expressed some openness to delaying it until after his impending second term. In the latest court filing today, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office said Trump\u2019s forthcoming presidency is not grounds for dropping a case that has already been tried, AP reports. But prosectors added: \u201cGiven the need to balance competing constitutional interests, consideration must be given\u201d to potentially freezing the case until after Trump is out of office. Trump was convicted in May of falsifying business records to cover up a scheme to influence the 2016 election by paying hush money to a porn actor who said they\u2019d had sex. Trump denies the allegations. Judge Juan Merchan had given prosecutors until today to share their thoughts on how to proceed with the case, which had been scheduled for sentencing on 26 November. Prosecutors in Donald Trump\u2019s Manhattan criminal hush-money case said in a letter on Tuesday that they plan on fighting the president-elect\u2019s push for its dismissal following his win over Kamala Harris. They said the court should set a timeline for Trump\u2019s expected motion to dismiss, which they \u201cintend to oppose\u201d. Prosecutors also believe that other proceedings should be put on hold until the dismissal issue is decided. Trump\u2019s scheduled 26 November sentencing in his Manhattan criminal hush-money case appears poised for adjournment, given prosecutors\u2019 request and a court calendar entry on Tuesday. Donald Trump is on his way to Texas, where he will be joining billionaire Elon Musk for a SpaceX launch later today. One of Trump\u2019s aides posted a video on X on Tuesday, showing Trump boarding a plane with the caption \u201cPresident @realDonaldTrump en route to @SpaceX!!!\u201d Hakeem Jeffries also said at the news conference that Democrats are prepared to push back against any effort at extremism that they see from the House Republican conference or from the incoming Trump administration. \u201cWe are prepared to work hard to find bipartisan common ground with our Republican colleagues and the incoming administration on any issue whenever and wherever possible, but at the same time, we will push back against far-right extremism whenever necessary,\u201d he said. At the news conference, the House minority leader, Democrat Hakeem Jeffries, said that the House Democratic caucus convened to \u201cbegin the process of organising in preparation for the 119th Congress\u201d. \u201cWe have made clear repeatedly, as House Democrats, we are prepared to work with the incoming administration to find bipartisan common ground on any issue whenever and wherever possible in order to make life better for hard-working American families and taxpayers and to solve problems on behalf of the American people\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cThat\u2019s our job.\u201d \u201cWe look forward to working hard on the issues that the American people have made clear coming out of this election matter to them,\u201d he added. House Democratic leaders are holding a press conference right now. Among those standing on stage are the House Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries; the Democratic whip, Katherine Clark; the Democratic caucus chair, Pete Aguilar; and others. New polling from Data for Progress found that a majority of voters disapprove of recess appointments and believe that president-elect Donald Trump should not be able to appoint his cabinet without confirmation from the Senate. The survey found that 54% of voters said that they disapprove of recess appointments while 38% say they approve of recess appointments. Notably, 60% of independents disapprove of Trump making recess appointments. According to the US constitution, the president can make recess appointments to fill vacant positions when the Senate is not in session. Want to read more about recess appointments and what they are? Read our explainer here: Nearly 100 House Democrats have signed a letter urging the House ethics committee to release its report into Matt Gaetz. \u201cThe United States Senate has a constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on presidential nominees, and it is critical that senators have all the information necessary to consider Mr Gaetz\u2019s nomination\u201d the letter reads. The letter was addressed to the Representative Michael Guest, the chair of the House ethics committee, as well as Representative Susan Wild, the top Democrat on the committee. \u201cWithholding the findings of your investigation may jeopardize the Senate\u2019s ability to provide fully informed, constitutionally required advice and consent regarding this nomination. Representative Gaetz\u2019s abrupt resignation from Congress should not circumvent the Senate\u2019s ability to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities,\u201d the letter adds. Voter turnout among people who live on tribal lands was 11 percentage points lower than others in the same state who do not live on tribal lands, according to a new study released on Tuesday by the Brennan Center for Justice. The study, which examined voter turnout from 2012 to 2022 across 21 states, sheds light on the significant barriers that Native American voters face. If the 900,000 voters on tribal lands in the study had turned out at the same rate as those who don\u2019t live on tribal lands in 2020, the study\u2019s authors concluded, 160,000 more votes would have been cast. Tribal lands with the highest concentrations of Native American adults also had lower turnout. \u201cParticipation rates between tribal lands with the smallest Native populations (less than 20 percent) and those with the largest Native populations (more than 80 percent) differed by 33 percentage points in presidential elections and 25 percentage points in midterm elections,\u201d the study found. \u201cThese findings demonstrate that Native Americans living on tribal lands are uniquely disenfranchised and demobilized from participating in federal elections.\u201d Native American voters on tribal lands often face unique obstacles to voting. Election offices and voting sites can be far away (the study noted that on the Pyramid Lake Reservation in Nevada the election office is more than 100 miles away). Several tribal lands also do not use standard addresses, making mail delivery more difficult. The post office can also be far away with limited hours. Voters on tribal lands were seven percentage points less likely to vote by mail than those not on tribal lands, the study found. Donald Trump\u2019s scheduled 26 November sentencing in his Manhattan criminal hush-money case has been adjourned, according to a court calendar entry on Tuesday. The postponement followed prosecution and defense filings requesting a delay in proceedings after Trump\u2019s victory. The prosecutors in the case are expected to submit paperwork sometime today indicating how they believe the case should proceed. Read more about it here. The House minority leader, Democrat Hakeem Jeffries, stated that he is \u201chonored\u201d to have been re-elected as House Democratic leader on Tuesday morning. \u201cWe will never give up the fight for the people\u201d Jeffries added. Though Donald Trump has announced his nominations for several cabinet roles in his second administration, some roles have yet to be announced. Some key roles that still need to be filled include: Treasury secretary Agriculture secretary Labor secretary Housing and urban development secretary Education secretary Who is Howard Lutnuick, Trump\u2019s reported choice for commerce secretary? Howard Lutnick is a longtime friend of Trump, co-chair of Trump\u2019s transition team, CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald and one of the few high-profile figures in corporate America to vocally endorse Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, my colleague Callum Jones reported over the weekend. Last month, Lutnick said in an interview that Trump \u201cpicked unfortunately\u201d when it came to hiring in his first term, describing the hires in the first administration as \u201cfreshman\u201d mistakes. Read more about Lutnick here. Punchbowl News is reporting that Donald Trump will name Howard Lutnick, the president-elect\u2019s transition co-chair, as his commerce secretary for his second administration. Lutnick is the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald and a longtime friend of Trump. An unidentified hacker has reportedly accessed a file shared among lawyers representing clients who have provided damaging testimony regarding Matt Gaetz, the New York Times is reporting, citing a person with knowledge of the activity. According to the New York Times, the computer file consisted of 24 exhibits, including testimony by a woman in which she says she had sex with Gaetz in 2017 when she was 17, as well as corroborating testimony by a second woman who said that she witnessed the encounter. The files were reportedly downloaded by a person using the name Altam Beezley at 1.23pm on Monday. But when a lawyer connected to the case sent an email to the address associated with Beezley, they received an automated reply that the recipient does not exist. South Carolina Republican representative Nancy Mace has introduced a bill to ban transgender women from facilities on Capitol Hill that correspond with their gender identity. This comes as Delaware elected Sarah McBride to the House earlier this month, who will become the first ever openly transgender member of Congress. Read more about it here. Hakeem Jeffries was re-elected as House Democratic leader this morning, according to Politico. Politico reported on Tuesday that Jeffries, who was unopposed in his bid for another term, will lead the Democrats as minority leader. Additionally, Representative Pete Aguilar of California was also reportedly re-elected to another term as Democratic caucus chair. Ken Martin, the chair of Minnesota\u2019s Democratic party, has announced his candidacy to lead the Democratic National Committee (DNC). \u201cWhen I took over Minnesota\u2019s Democratic party, we were in debt and disarray, reeling from major losses\u201d Martin said in a video posted online this morning. \u201cBut we brought people together, we built a winning coalition and delivered results.\u201d \u201cSince then, we\u2019ve won every single statewide election\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we are the last of the blue wall states still standing.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a creature of DC, that\u2019s not me\u201d Martin continued. \u201cBut I do know how the DNC works and how it isn\u2019t working \u2026 We need to reconnect our ideas \u2013 which we know are popular in red, blue and purple states across this country \u2013 back to our party and to our candidates.\u201d Martin O\u2019Malley, the former governor of Maryland, has also entered the race to lead the DNC, announcing his candidacy on Monday. President-elect Donald Trump will join billionaire Elon Musk for a SpaceX launch in Texas later today, as reported by Reuters. This will be the sixth test flight to space for SpaceX\u2019s Starship rocket. The test launch is planned for 5pm ET. Attorney general Merrick Garland made his first public remarks following president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s selection of former Representative Matt Gaetz to head the justice department. On Monday, Garland spoke with career prosecutors at the southern district of New York, reportedly telling them that they are the \u201cbackbone\u201d of the justice department and urged them to continue to \u201cuphold the rule of law\u201d according to CNN. \u201cI may be coming to the end of my tenure at the justice department, but I know that all of you will continue in the department\u2019s mission \u2013 what has always been its mission \u2013 to uphold the rule of law, keep our country safe and to protect civil rights,\u201d Garland reportedly said. He added: \u201cThe career lawyers of the justice department as a whole, you are the institutional backbone of this department. You are the historical memory of this department. You are the heart and soul of the department. You are the justice department.\u201d Russia has claimed debris from US-made missile has landed in the country\u2019s Bryansk region. Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defence told Russian state-owned media that it had shot down five of the missiles over the Bryansk region. The attack resulted in no casualties or damage, it said. The claims have not been independently verified. Ukrainian officials have also not commented on the Russian reports, and there has been no confirmation from US or other allied powers. This news comes as fears rise over major escalation, as just hours earlier Russian President Vladimir Putin approved an updated nuclear doctrine and expanded the list of criteria that require a nuclear response. Read more over at our Ukraine war live blog. Billionaire Elon Musk, a close ally of Donald Trump, defended former representative Matt Gaetz this morning. In a statement posted on X, Musk said that Gaetz has three \u201ccritical assets\u201d that he believes are needed for the role of Attorney General. \u201cA big brain, a spine of steel and an axe to grind\u201d Musk, who has been deeply involved in the Trump administration\u2019s transition plans, wrote. Gaetz \u201cis the Judge Dredd America needs to clean up a corrupt system and put powerful bad actors in prison\u201d Musk continued. \u201cGaetz will be our Hammer of Justice.\u201d In a second post, Musk addressed the allegations against Gaetz \u201cI consider them worth less than nothing\u201d Musk said. \u201cUnder our laws, a man is considered innocent until proven guilty.\u201d As we have been reporting, Matt Gaetz, Trump\u2019s controversial pick to be the new attorney general, is at the centre of a number of allegations which could prevent him from passing Senate confirmation for the high-profile role. As my colleague Anna Betts reports in this story, an attorney representing two women who he says testified before the House ethics committee has claimed that Gaetz paid both women for sex and that one of the women alleged she witnessed Gaetz having sex with a minor. The new allegations were revealed by the attorney Joel Leppard during an interview with ABC News on Monday \u2013 less than a week after Gaetz resigned from Congress following his nomination by Donald Trump to serve as attorney general in his second administration. In the interview, Leppard said his clients were paid by Gaetz using Venmo and said that one of the women testified to the committee that she saw Gaetz at a house party in 2017 having sex with a 17-year-old girl. \u201cShe testified that in July of 2017 at his house party, she was walking out to the pool area, and she looked to her right, and she saw Rep Gaetz having sex with her friend, who was 17,\u201d Leppard said. Gaetz was investigated by the justice department on suspicion of child sex trafficking, but the department decided not to bring charges. The House ethics committee then launched its own inquiry into allegations that Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and other ethical breaches. Gaetz has repeatedly denied the allegations against him. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has said he believes the report should not be made public, as Gaetz , a former Florida congressman, is no longer a House member. Lauren Gambino is political correspondent for Guardian US, based in Washington DC Donald Trump said on Monday that his administration would declare a national emergency and use the US military to carry out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. In an early morning social media post, Trump responded \u201cTRUE!!!\u201d to a post by Tom Fitton, the president of the conservative group Judicial Watch, who wrote on 8 November that the next administration \u201cwill use military assets to reverse the Biden invasion through a mass deportation program\u201d. Since his decisive victory, Trump has said he intends to make good on his campaign promise to execute mass deportations, beginning on the first day of his presidency. But many aspects of what he has described as the \u201clargest deportation program in American history\u201d remain unclear. Trump has previously suggested he would rely on wartime powers, military troops and sympathetic state and local leaders. Such a sprawling campaign \u2013 and the use of military personnel to carry it out \u2013 is almost certain to draw legal challenges and pushback from Democratic leaders, some of whom have already said they would refuse to cooperate with Trump\u2019s deportation agenda. Through personnel announcements, the president-elect has put together a team of loyalists and hardliners to implement a second-term immigration crackdown. Tom Homan, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in his first administration, was named \u201cborder czar\u201d with a wide-ranging remit. In a short social media post announcing the position, Trump said Homan would be \u201cin charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin\u201d. Also returning for a second term is Stephen Miller, a chief defender of the last administration\u2019s most controversial immigration policies, including the use of family separation as a means of deterrence. Miller was named White House deputy chief of staff for policy and a homeland security adviser, giving him far-reaching influence over immigration policy. You can read the full story here: The US House ethics committee is expected to discuss next steps in its investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s attorney general pick Matt Gaetz, the former Florida congressman, tomorrow, according to Reuters. A growing number of Republicans in the Senate, which has a constitutional duty to confirm or reject high-level presidential appointments, have called on the House panel to turn over its findings on allegations of sexual misconduct involving a teenager and drug use by Gaetz. It is uncertain whether the probe will continue because Gaetz, 42, resigned his seat in the Republican-controlled House last week, hours after Trump unveiled announced him as his choice for AG and as the probe was nearing completion. Gaetz denies any wrongdoing. Amid growing cross-party concern, Axios is now reporting that Trump is personally calling senators to press them to confirm Gaetz to be his attorney general. Here is an extract from the outlet\u2019s report: Trump is digging in on his embattled and controversial nominee and is sending an unmistakable message to Senate Republicans that he expects him to be confirmed. \u201cHe clearly wants Matt Gaetz,\u201d said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), who received a call from Trump. \u201cHe believes Matt Gaetz is the one person who will have the fearlessness and ferociousness, really, to do what needs doing at the department of justice.\u201d \u201cOne thing about Donald Trump, people should never confuse his support for one of his nominees as a tactical or strategic tool for somebody else,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cAnd at least to this point, he\u2019s putting his own political capital behind it.\u201d \u201cAnd he\u2019s a pretty persuasive guy,\u201d Cramer said. Another senator also confirmed to Axios that Trump reached out, calling on them to rally behind him. Donald Trump has nominated former congressman and co-host of \u201cThe Bottom Line\u201d on Fox Business Sean Duffy to be his transport secretary in his next administration. Duffy served in Congress from 2011 until 2019. Before being elected to public office, he was district attorney for Ashland county, Wisconsin, from 2002 to 2008 and previously had a reality TV show role. Duffy was a cast member on The Real World: Boston in 1997 where he would meet his wife, Fox news contributor Rachel Campos-Duffy (you can read more about Duffy\u2019s time in Congress here). In a post on Truth social, Trump said Duffy would use his experience in Congress \u201cto maintain and rebuild our nation\u2019s Infrastructure, and fulfil our mission of ushering in the golden age of travel, focusing on safety, efficiency and innovation\u201d. \u201cThe husband of a wonderful woman, Rachel Campos-Duffy, a STAR on Fox News, and the father of nine incredible children, Sean knows how important it is for families to be able to travel safely, and with peace of mind,\u201d the president-elect added. If confirmed, Duffy will oversee aviation, automotive, rail, transit and other transportation policies at the department with about a $110bn (\u00a386bn) budget. A spokesperson for Fox News Media wished Duffy \u201cthe best of luck in his return to Washington\u201d and said he left the company on Monday. Duffy is so far the second Fox-affiliated television host that Trump has named to his Cabinet. Trump last week announced his choice of Fox News host Pete Hegseth to serve as his defence secretary. Hegseth was a major in the Minnesota national guard who served as a prison guard at Guant\u00e1namo Bay detention camp and served in Iraq and Afghanistan before becoming an outspoken rightwing critic of the military. He has no experience in government and is untested on the global stage. Here is some background, courtesy of my colleague, Victoria Bekiempis, on why the judge in Donald Trump\u2019s Manhattan criminal hush-money case has postponed deciding on whether to throw out the president-elect\u2019s conviction on presidential immunity grounds: Judge Juan Merchan\u2019s office told Trump\u2019s lawyers and prosecutors that he would delay the ruling until 19 November after defense and prosecutors submitted letters asking for a postponement. Merchan\u2019s decision was not made public until Tuesday \u2013 the day he was set to issue his ruling on the immunity issue\u2026 Trump was originally scheduled to be sentenced on 10 July. Then came the 1 July US supreme court ruling that granted sitting presidents broad immunity for official acts taken during their time in office. Trump urged Merchan to delay his sentencing in light of this ruling. His legal team pushed to challenge Trump\u2019s conviction, citing the supreme court decision. Merchan agreed to mull over the legalities and pushed back the proceeding until 18 September \u201cif such is still necessary\u201d given the supreme court decision. Trump\u2019s attorneys in August asked for still more time, saying that they would need it to possibly appeal Merchan\u2019s decision. Merchan on 6 September delayed Trump\u2019s sentencing yet again until 26 November \u2013 after the election \u2013 saying the situation was \u201cfraught with complexities\u201d. He said this decision was meant \u201cto avoid any appearance \u2013 however unwarranted \u2013 that the proceeding has been affected by or seeks to affect the approaching presidential election in which the defendant is a candidate\u201d. Prosecutors on 10 November sent an email to Merchan indicating that Trump\u2019s team had asked them to agree to a stay so there would be time to review \u201ca number of arguments based on the impact on this proceeding from the results of the presidential election; defendant\u2019s forthcoming certification as president-elect on January 6, 2025; and his inauguration on January 20, 2025\u201d\u2026 They asked Merchan for time to \u201cassess recent developments\u201d and to give them until 19 November to advise him what they believe are \u201cappropriate steps going forward\u201d. Prosecutors indicated that they had spoken to Trump\u2019s team about this and that they agreed to this request. Good morning, and welcome to our US politics blog. Donald Trump, 78, was convicted in May of falsifying business records to cover up a $130,000 (\u00a3102,809) hush money payment his former lawyer Michael Cohen made to porn star Stormy Daniels for her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump, who denies it. The president-elect had been scheduled to be sentenced on 26 November, but justice Juan Merchan last week put all proceedings in the case on pause at the request of Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office. The prosecutors had asked for more time to consider next steps in the case, citing the need to balance the \u201ccompeting interests\u201d between having the criminal case go forward as normal and protecting the office of the president. They are due to propose their next steps later today. Trump\u2019s win in the 2024 presidential election has thwarted his other criminal cases, including the federal election interference and classified documents cases. The state-level election case in Georgia is on pause pending appeal in the wake of news that the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, had hired a man with whom she had an affair as prosecutor.

In a statement, Trump extolled the \u201cincredible\u201d job McMahon, the billionaire co-founder of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), has been doing as transition team co-chair and said: \u201cAs Secretary of Education, Linda will fight tirelessly to expand \u2018Choice\u2019 to every State in America, and empower parents to make the best Education decisions for their families. \u2026 We will send Education BACK TO THE STATES, and Linda will spearhead that effort.\u201d McMahon was made transition team chair in August, after having donated $814,600 to Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign as of July. She served in Trump\u2019s cabinet in his first administration as the administrator of the Small Business Administration from 2017 to 2019. McMahon chaired America First Action, a super PAC that backed Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, where she raised $83m in 2020. She provided $6 million to help Trump\u2019s candidacy after he secured the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, according to the Associated Press. McMahon is the former chief executive of WWE, which she co-founded with her husband, Vince McMahon. In October, McMahon was named in a new lawsuit involving WWE. The suit alleges that she and other leaders of the company allowed the sexual abuse of young boys at the hands of a ringside announcer, former WWE ring crew chief Melvin Phillips Jr. The complaint specifically alleges that the McMahons knew about the abuse and failed to stop it. An attorney for the McMahons told USA Today Sports that the allegations are \u201cfalse claims\u201d stemming from reporting that the couple deems \u201cabsurd, defamatory and utterly meritless\u201d. McMahon stepped down from her position as WWE\u2019s chief executive to enter politics. She ran twice for a US Senate seat in Connecticut, but lost in 2010 to Richard Blumenthal and in 2012 to Chris Murphy.

The US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d by comments from the Kremlin over the new revised nuclear doctrine.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The UK\u2019s prime minister, Keir Starmer, said: </strong>\u201cThere\u2019s irresponsible rhetoric coming from Russia, and that is not going to deter our support for Ukraine.\u201d Issuing a direct message to the Russian president from the G20 summit in Brazil, Starmer added: \u201cOn day 1,000 of Russia\u2019s illegal war in Ukraine, I say again: \u2018End the war.

Its share in every stage of the solar panel manufacturing chain exceeds 80%, <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/solar-pv-global-supply-chains/executive-summary\">according to</a> the International Energy Agency. Last year it <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/news/opinion/chinas-solar--storage-exports-achieve-record-growth-with-more-than-40-surge/\">exported</a> a record high of 227 gigawatts (GW) of solar panels \u2013 more than the entire installed solar capacity of the United States.</p> <p>But virtually none of those panels were destined for the US. Less than 1% of the 54 GW of solar panels the US imported last year came from China.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/08/tariffs-tech-and-taiwan-how-china-hopes-to-trump-proof-its-economy\">Tariffs, tech and Taiwan: how China hopes to Trump-proof its economy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More than a decade of US duties on Chinese solar cells and panels \u2013 which are expected to be ramped up further by Trump \u2013 have all but eliminated Chinese solar equipment from the US.</p> <p>This has spurred some Chinese companies to rapidly shift and expand their supply chains overseas in what US government agencies allege is<em><strong> </strong></em>an attempt to dodge US levies \u2013 an alleged approach that may be setting an example for other manufacturers.</p> <p>Because although less than 1% of the US\u2019s solar imports come from China, more than 80% of them come from four countries in south-east Asia: Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. Last year, the US Commerce Department <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2023/08/department-commerce-issues-final-determination-circumvention-inquiries\">concluded</a> that certain Chinese photovoltaic (PV) companies had been re-routing their supply chains through those countries in order to avoid US tariffs. </p> <p>China\u2019s major PV technology companies have been opening factories in south-east Asia since at least 2016. That year, the world\u2019s third-largest solar manufacturer, Longi, expanded to Malaysia with its first overseas production base, and the launch of a Thai subsidiary. It also has a facility in Vietnam, and this year began construction of another Malaysian project and a joint-venture factory in the US. \u201cThe company\u2019s shipment capabilities in the US market are expected to be enhanced,\u201d it said in its 2023 annual report.</p> <p>In 2022, Longi <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/chinas-longi-denies-circumventing-us-tariffs-solar-panels-2022-12-05/\">denied findings</a> by the US Department of Commerce that a Vietnam subsidiary, Vina Solar, was among a number of Chinese companies <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2023/08/department-commerce-issues-final-determination-circumvention-inquiries\">circumventing tariffs</a> by finishing products in south-east Asia, and said it was obeying US law.</p> <p>But decision-makers in Washington see the expansions into south-east Asia very specifically as \u201can attempt to circumvent antidumping and countervailing duties\u201d, said Cory Combs, associate director at Trivium China, a research company.</p> <p>Longi denied the commerce department\u2019s findings in 2022, and in its interim annual report this year said the \u201ctrade barriers\u201d imposed on PV producers had \u201cincreased uncertainty\u201d for companies, appearing to suggest that the global expansions were aimed at diversifying supply chains.</p> <p>Last month, the commerce department announced new preliminary duties on <a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/commerce-preliminary-countervailing-duty-investigation-crystalline-photovoltaic-cells-cambodia\">several</a> Chinese solar manufacturers that were exporting from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. The decision follows a complaint from US solar panel companies that alleged Chinese companies were using their factories in those four countries to flood the US market with panels priced below their cost of production.</p> <p>Longi was not among the solar manufacturers on the list, and it is not clear if the list includes one of its subsidiaries. Longi did not respond to repeated requests for clarification or comment.</p> <p>Various US tariffs and antidumping duties have since been levied on the industry in the region at either country or company level, or in some cases both, and eyes are on the movements of Chinese industries.</p> <p>Speaking generally, tariffs \u201care a bit like whack-a-mole\u201d, said Marius Mordal Bakke, a senior analyst at Rystad Energy, a business intelligence company. As soon as import duties are targeted at one country, companies will up sticks and move to another. Rerouting supply chains costs money, \u201cbut as long as you can sell your product for three to four times as much in the US market, then it\u2019s probably likely worth it.\u201d</p> <h2>Next stop: the Middle East</h2> <p>The game of whack-a-mole now seems to be spreading to other parts of south-east Asia, such as Laos and Indonesia. In the first eight months of this year, US imports of solar goods from Indonesia reportedly nearly doubled to $246m, while shipments from Laos have also been surging.</p> <p>The industry is also moving to the Middle East, said Combs.</p> <p>\u201cAs south-east Asia gets hit harder and harder by these tariffs a lot of Chinese investors are moving into the [Gulf Cooperation Council, or GCC], particularly Saudi Arabia and the UAE and Oman. Does this happen quickly enough that the GCC becomes the next south-east Asia and then also gets hit with anti dumping and all that stuff? That\u2019s already where the conversation is in DC.\u201d</p> <p>Chinese companies are well aware of the need to tariff-proof their businesses, and there are signs of plans being made to get ahead of Trump\u2019s promised tariffs, on China and elsewhere. </p> <p>Tongwei, China\u2019s biggest solar company, said in its annual report that many Chinese photovoltaic companies have \u201cstarted exploring new avenues for growth, including establishing manufacturing facilities overseas\u201d, citing the US, the Middle East and Vietnam as examples, without elaborating on the company\u2019s own plans.</p> <p>The US solar market is relatively small. In 2023, it accounted for less than 10% of the solar panel global market, according to analysis by Lauri Myllyvirta, the lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Given over 93% of global production capacity for polysillicon \u2013 the raw material to make solar panels \u2013 is in China, it will be nearly impossible for the US solar industry to fully extricate itself from Chinese companies.</p> <p>Indeed, the biggest risk to the Chinese solar industry from the incoming Trump administration may not be tariffs, but politics. \u201cThe solar industry in China has positioned itself to supply the solar equipment needed for a rapid global energy transition,\u201d Myllyvirta said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s quite clear that the Trump administration is going to try and slow down that transition\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Businesses are bracing for the economic impact of a second Trump presidency, which, if his campaign promises are to be believed, will mean tariffs across nearly all imports to the US, especially those from China. But amid the gloom over the spectre of a renewed global trade war, some manufacturers may be looking to those who already have a playbook on dealing with aggressive US levies, such as China\u2019s solar companies. China all but owns the global solar market. Its share in every stage of the solar panel manufacturing chain exceeds 80%, according to the International Energy Agency. Last year it exported a record high of 227 gigawatts (GW) of solar panels \u2013 more than the entire installed solar capacity of the United States. But virtually none of those panels were destined for the US. Less than 1% of the 54 GW of solar panels the US imported last year came from China. More than a decade of US duties on Chinese solar cells and panels \u2013 which are expected to be ramped up further by Trump \u2013 have all but eliminated Chinese solar equipment from the US. This has spurred some Chinese companies to rapidly shift and expand their supply chains overseas in what US government agencies allege is an attempt to dodge US levies \u2013 an alleged approach that may be setting an example for other manufacturers. Because although less than 1% of the US\u2019s solar imports come from China, more than 80% of them come from four countries in south-east Asia: Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. Last year, the US Commerce Department concluded that certain Chinese photovoltaic (PV) companies had been re-routing their supply chains through those countries in order to avoid US tariffs. China\u2019s major PV technology companies have been opening factories in south-east Asia since at least 2016. That year, the world\u2019s third-largest solar manufacturer, Longi, expanded to Malaysia with its first overseas production base, and the launch of a Thai subsidiary. It also has a facility in Vietnam, and this year began construction of another Malaysian project and a joint-venture factory in the US. \u201cThe company\u2019s shipment capabilities in the US market are expected to be enhanced,\u201d it said in its 2023 annual report. In 2022, Longi denied findings by the US Department of Commerce that a Vietnam subsidiary, Vina Solar, was among a number of Chinese companies circumventing tariffs by finishing products in south-east Asia, and said it was obeying US law. But decision-makers in Washington see the expansions into south-east Asia very specifically as \u201can attempt to circumvent antidumping and countervailing duties\u201d, said Cory Combs, associate director at Trivium China, a research company. Longi denied the commerce department\u2019s findings in 2022, and in its interim annual report this year said the \u201ctrade barriers\u201d imposed on PV producers had \u201cincreased uncertainty\u201d for companies, appearing to suggest that the global expansions were aimed at diversifying supply chains. Last month, the commerce department announced new preliminary duties on several Chinese solar manufacturers that were exporting from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. The decision follows a complaint from US solar panel companies that alleged Chinese companies were using their factories in those four countries to flood the US market with panels priced below their cost of production. Longi was not among the solar manufacturers on the list, and it is not clear if the list includes one of its subsidiaries. Longi did not respond to repeated requests for clarification or comment. Various US tariffs and antidumping duties have since been levied on the industry in the region at either country or company level, or in some cases both, and eyes are on the movements of Chinese industries. Speaking generally, tariffs \u201care a bit like whack-a-mole\u201d, said Marius Mordal Bakke, a senior analyst at Rystad Energy, a business intelligence company. As soon as import duties are targeted at one country, companies will up sticks and move to another. Rerouting supply chains costs money, \u201cbut as long as you can sell your product for three to four times as much in the US market, then it\u2019s probably likely worth it.\u201d Next stop: the Middle East The game of whack-a-mole now seems to be spreading to other parts of south-east Asia, such as Laos and Indonesia. In the first eight months of this year, US imports of solar goods from Indonesia reportedly nearly doubled to $246m, while shipments from Laos have also been surging. The industry is also moving to the Middle East, said Combs. \u201cAs south-east Asia gets hit harder and harder by these tariffs a lot of Chinese investors are moving into the [Gulf Cooperation Council, or GCC], particularly Saudi Arabia and the UAE and Oman. Does this happen quickly enough that the GCC becomes the next south-east Asia and then also gets hit with anti dumping and all that stuff? That\u2019s already where the conversation is in DC.\u201d Chinese companies are well aware of the need to tariff-proof their businesses, and there are signs of plans being made to get ahead of Trump\u2019s promised tariffs, on China and elsewhere. Tongwei, China\u2019s biggest solar company, said in its annual report that many Chinese photovoltaic companies have \u201cstarted exploring new avenues for growth, including establishing manufacturing facilities overseas\u201d, citing the US, the Middle East and Vietnam as examples, without elaborating on the company\u2019s own plans. The US solar market is relatively small. In 2023, it accounted for less than 10% of the solar panel global market, according to analysis by Lauri Myllyvirta, the lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Given over 93% of global production capacity for polysillicon \u2013 the raw material to make solar panels \u2013 is in China, it will be nearly impossible for the US solar industry to fully extricate itself from Chinese companies. Indeed, the biggest risk to the Chinese solar industry from the incoming Trump administration may not be tariffs, but politics. \u201cThe solar industry in China has positioned itself to supply the solar equipment needed for a rapid global energy transition,\u201d Myllyvirta said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s quite clear that the Trump administration is going to try and slow down that transition\u201d.",

In 2024, almost 95% of people in high-income countries are connected to the internet, compared with about 25% in low-income countries. \u201cChildren are experiencing a myriad of crises, from climate shocks to online dangers, and these are set to intensify in the years to come,\u201d said Catherine Russell, Unicef\u2019s executive director. \u201cThe decisions world leaders make today \u2013 or fail to make \u2013 define the world children will inherit \u2026 Decades of progress, particularly for girls, are under threat.\u201d Much of the emphasis of the report is on the impact of the climate crisis on children, nearly half of whom (approximately 1 billion) live in countries that face a high risk of environmental disasters. Even before they take their first breath, children\u2019s brains, lungs and immune systems are susceptible to pollution, disease and extreme weather. As they grow, their education, nutrition, safety, security and mental health are shaped by the climate and environment. The climate crisis makes more children vulnerable to disease. Rising average temperatures have led to an increase in mosquito populations and greater risks of the diseases they transmit, such as malaria, dengue, Zika and West Nile virus. Extreme weather can stop children from eating a healthy diet, while tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, heatwaves and earthquakes have been linked to a range of mental health issues, including post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Air pollution is already a leading cause of death in children under five and was linked to 709,000 deaths in children under five years old in 2021, according to the 2024 State of Global Air report. The World Bank recently called the educational impacts of the climate crisis an \u201ceconomic timebomb\u201d, as climate shocks can have profound effects on children\u2019s education, leading to absence from school and widening learning gaps worldwide. Since 2022, more than 400 million students around the world have experienced school closures due to extreme weather. \u201cThe world already knows what it needs to do to limit the worst impacts of climate change,\u201d said Russell. \u201cYouth leaders have been forceful \u2013 and rightly so \u2013 in urging national leaders to stick to their climate commitments. To ignore those calls is to betray the futures of children and young people. We cannot allow that to happen.\u201d",
