Ani Dasgupta, chief executive of the US-based World Resources Institute thinktank, said: \u201cDespite major headwinds, negotiators in Baku eked out a deal that at least triples climate finance flowing to developing countries [from a previous longstanding goal of $100bn a year]. The $300bn goal is not enough, but is an important down payment toward a safer, more equitable future. The agreement recognises how critical it is for vulnerable countries to have better access to finance that does not burden them with unsustainable debt.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Arne Slot has said he is having to raise his game because the standard running through the Premier League from top to bottom is so high. The Dutchman has led Liverpool to the summit after 11 games and quickly realised the step up in quality from the Eredivisie. On Sunday Liverpool travel to bottom-of-the-table Southampton, where Slot is not expecting a walkover, as he believes any team in the division can defeat any other. Despite Southampton winning once this season, Slot praised Russell Martin for sticking to his principles of possession-based football. \u201cThe biggest difference is that all the 17 other managers [in the Eredivisie], they have gameplans and style of play and all kind of great ideas, but the quality difference between the two clubs [AZ and Feyenoord] I worked for and the teams we faced was so big that you can come up with every brilliant gameplan but it doesn\u2019t work because there is so much quality difference,\u201d Slot said. \u201cSouthampton and all these teams have players that can play for big clubs. If you have a good gameplan and a good playing style, it can really work against us or against Manchester City or against Arsenal. That\u2019s what makes it more testing, the quality of the players especially. As a result of that, gameplans work better for these managers than for the 16, 17, 18 of the Eredivisie.\u201d Martin\u2019s methods have been criticised but the former Scotland defender is unwilling to compromise despite the poor results.

      "bodyText": "The way the cricket calendar is carved up sounds a bit absurd; a kind of speed-dating event for the chief executives and chairs of the full-member nations that is hosted every four years by the International Cricket Council. Not that the ICC \u2013 more events company than governing body \u2013 gets involved. Its officials apparently have to leave the room before the bigwigs start schmoozing at the tables and operations types plumb the fixtures into their spreadsheets. The men\u2019s future tours programme emerged from one of these opaque lock-ins in 2022 and even at the time England\u2019s winter of 2024-25 stuck out as slightly unimaginative. Test tours of Pakistan and New Zealand were scheduled for the second winter in two years, the latter for the third time in five. This despite England\u2019s entire four-year block featuring no Tests in Sri Lanka or the West Indies and the gap between Tests in South Africa \u2013 a third favourite of their travelling supporters \u2013 set to be seven years when they return in late 2026. Given the number of moving parts \u2013 the alliances and the schisms, a free-for-all process and the World Test Championship (WTC) \u2013 hoping for a sensible, even spread was probably optimistic. In fairness, even with the repetition, and England being out of the running for next year\u2019s WTC final at Lord\u2019s, this winter is still an intriguing one. The 2-1 loss in Pakistan in October, where they won 3-0 two years ago, rocked the good ship Bazball, such that the three-Test series that starts in Christchurch on Thursday feels pretty important. Under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum, captain and head coach, England have enjoyed an upturn of fortunes compared with the bleak 18 months that came before. Twenty wins and 11 defeats from 32 Tests is the second-best ratio behind Australia in this time and their pedal-to-the-metal cricket \u2013 the fortunes of which have lurched wildly \u2013 has been compelling to watch. Equally, they have won seven, lost seven in the past 12 months and have not won an away series since Pakistan in late 2022. That drawn home Ashes in 2023 was an opportunity missed, while New Zealand\u2019s recent 3-0 triumph in India has made England\u2019s 4-1 defeat there look a touch worse. Grumbles about their style grew stronger in Pakistan; a sense they are wedded to all-out aggression and are inflexible when the pitch is not flat. Even with McCullum\u2019s contract now extended to 2027 and soon to incorporate the white-ball teams, next year \u2013 India at home and an away Ashes series \u2013 will probably define how the project is viewed overall. To that end, England could do with a strong showing against the team they know better than most (and who could make that WTC final with a clean sweep). This will be the seventh time they have met for Test cricket in the past 10 years.

      "body": "<p>Still, at least Manchester City can now concentrate on the Ballon d\u2019Or. There was a lavish celebration for the world\u2019s best player before this game: the word RODRI illuminated in giant letters on the pitch like a Vegas cabaret show, City\u2019s injured midfield linchpin holding his trophy aloft as fireworks lit the night sky. The tailoring was immaculate; the audiovisuals impressive; the crowd rapt.</p> <p>And then came a game of football, in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">the champions were beaten 4-0</a> by a team with Radu Dragusin and Ben Davies at centre-half. It was City\u2019s biggest home defeat in more than two decades: the sort of result that draws small involuntary gasps, that causes spectators to get their phones out and zoom in on the scoreboard, capturing for posterity this curious rip in the space\u2011time fabric.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/we-are-fragile-defensively-pep-guardiola-admits-title-hopes-are-fading\">\u2018We are fragile defensively\u2019: Pep Guardiola admits title hopes are fading</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What it was not, however, was a shock. At least, not for anyone more than vaguely acquainted with City\u2019s football over recent weeks. A fifth consecutive loss \u2013 six if you count the Premier League vote on associated party transactions on Friday \u2013 is of less significance than the recurring manner of those losses: City being undone not by fluke or happenstance but by teams who were simply braver than them, stronger, more imaginative, more united.</p> <p>And yes, City keep getting done on the counterattack. But just as relevant as the counterattack is what comes before and after: the limp and uncoordinated efforts to win the ball back, the reluctant and rote shuffling back into position, second and third runners not being picked up, the 50-50s not being won. These are issues not of tactics or shape but of conditioning, physical and mental.</p> <p>Nor is this simply a Rodri problem, as brilliant a player as he is, as yawning the gaps were in midfield here as Tottenham poured forward with numbers. The malaise here is collective: witness the first goal, as a puffing Ilkay G\u00fcndogan simply lets James Maddison go, delegating what should have been his job with an urgent outstretched arm that nobody sees. But Josko Gvardiol also lets Dejan Kulusevski cut inside, the centre-halves fail to space correctly, and there was insufficient pressure on the ball to begin with.</p>    <p>The common theme here: everyone is relying on someone else to bail them out. There is a sense of shirked responsibility here, of leaving the extra yard to others. Again with the second goal in the 20th minute, Gvardiol with the slack pass to G\u00fcndogan, nobody covering Maddison\u2019s reverse run. Again with the third, Kulusevski simply shrugging off Phil Foden, City players bumping into each other like Minions, Spurs tearing up the field and scoring again.</p> <p>No champion team should ever be this fatally reliant on a single man. Pep Guardiola has found solutions in the past and will doubtless find them again. But right now he needs his players to step up. Since his sparkling start to the season Erling Haaland has scored two goals in his last seven league games, from an xG of 7.8. In short, he is basically finishing about as well as you would with his chances at the moment.</p> <p>What this means, on the other hand, is anyone\u2019s guess. Is this an implosion? The end of an era? Or basically the characteristic autumn blip from a team who are still second in the league and will probably still romp to the title by five points? In short, are <em>we</em> the ones overthinking this?</p> <p>Maybe.

      "bodyText": "Still, at least Manchester City can now concentrate on the Ballon d\u2019Or. There was a lavish celebration for the world\u2019s best player before this game: the word RODRI illuminated in giant letters on the pitch like a Vegas cabaret show, City\u2019s injured midfield linchpin holding his trophy aloft as fireworks lit the night sky. The tailoring was immaculate; the audiovisuals impressive; the crowd rapt. And then came a game of football, in which the champions were beaten 4-0 by a team with Radu Dragusin and Ben Davies at centre-half. It was City\u2019s biggest home defeat in more than two decades: the sort of result that draws small involuntary gasps, that causes spectators to get their phones out and zoom in on the scoreboard, capturing for posterity this curious rip in the space\u2011time fabric. What it was not, however, was a shock. At least, not for anyone more than vaguely acquainted with City\u2019s football over recent weeks. A fifth consecutive loss \u2013 six if you count the Premier League vote on associated party transactions on Friday \u2013 is of less significance than the recurring manner of those losses: City being undone not by fluke or happenstance but by teams who were simply braver than them, stronger, more imaginative, more united. And yes, City keep getting done on the counterattack. But just as relevant as the counterattack is what comes before and after: the limp and uncoordinated efforts to win the ball back, the reluctant and rote shuffling back into position, second and third runners not being picked up, the 50-50s not being won. These are issues not of tactics or shape but of conditioning, physical and mental. Nor is this simply a Rodri problem, as brilliant a player as he is, as yawning the gaps were in midfield here as Tottenham poured forward with numbers. The malaise here is collective: witness the first goal, as a puffing Ilkay G\u00fcndogan simply lets James Maddison go, delegating what should have been his job with an urgent outstretched arm that nobody sees. But Josko Gvardiol also lets Dejan Kulusevski cut inside, the centre-halves fail to space correctly, and there was insufficient pressure on the ball to begin with. The common theme here: everyone is relying on someone else to bail them out. There is a sense of shirked responsibility here, of leaving the extra yard to others. Again with the second goal in the 20th minute, Gvardiol with the slack pass to G\u00fcndogan, nobody covering Maddison\u2019s reverse run. Again with the third, Kulusevski simply shrugging off Phil Foden, City players bumping into each other like Minions, Spurs tearing up the field and scoring again. No champion team should ever be this fatally reliant on a single man. Pep Guardiola has found solutions in the past and will doubtless find them again. But right now he needs his players to step up. Since his sparkling start to the season Erling Haaland has scored two goals in his last seven league games, from an xG of 7.8. In short, he is basically finishing about as well as you would with his chances at the moment. What this means, on the other hand, is anyone\u2019s guess. Is this an implosion? The end of an era? Or basically the characteristic autumn blip from a team who are still second in the league and will probably still romp to the title by five points? In short, are we the ones overthinking this? Maybe. Certainly Guardiola was in bullish mood after this game, assuring us this group of players were still champion footballers, that he still had everything he needed to turn this around. But even if this run of results is unprecedented, there have been enough portents \u2013 Wolves, Fulham, Inter, Arsenal \u2013 to suggest this is a trend rather than an anomaly. Guardiola talks a lot about his trophies these days. He rarely misses an opportunity to blazon what this team have achieved, to celebrate and revel in their dominance. And, you know, fair enough. But perhaps it is also the hallmark of a regime increasingly preoccupied with projection, with how things look and are portrayed. The timing of his new contract announcement, which frankly could have happened any time between now and May. The legal battle with the Premier League, the furious briefings, the litany of documentaries and content, a Ballon d\u2019Or celebration immediately before a key league game.

His team suffered their 12th straight defeat, when they were beaten 45-12 by South Africa. Gatland said he wanted to talk to his family and his bosses at the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) before he makes a decision. For its part, the WRU has committed to bringing in two independent experts to help with an end\u2011of\u2011season review, which will decide whether Gatland stays in post if he doesn\u2019t quit first. Gatland did not deny rumours that he could move into a different role at the WRU, which would involve him stepping away from the day-to-day running of the team but give him more influence over the overall strategy for the sport in Wales.

single facet of their game. So much so that it\u2019s easy to forget that Manchester City threatened to play them off the park during the opening exchanges. But Spurs held firm, then uncoiled themselves as an attacking force, and City simply couldn\u2019t cope. James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski were outrageously good; Son Heung-min not far behind them in that respect either. City hadn\u2019t lost at the Etihad for 52 matches. But now look! The four-in-a-row champions have lost five on the bounce in all competitions. This is an unprecedented slump for City in their modern guise; Pep has never suffered such a humiliating run in his entire managerial career. But take nothing away from how good Tottenham were. What a way to get their season back on track.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-23T19:32:10.642Z\">at 7.32pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-67422c298f086501868e84a5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-23T19:26:32.860Z\">7.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FULL TIME: Manchester City 0-4 Tottenham Hotspur</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Spurs humiliate a Manchester giant on their own field again!

an international break, and yet it feels like these two never went away.</strong> They\u2019ve hardly been out of the news all week: Pep Guardiola with his new two-year extension to his Manchester City contract, Spurs dealing with the Bentancur Imbroglio. In that sense there\u2019s more of a feel-good vibe around City right now \u2026 but then Spurs have only lost their last two matches, while City have lost their last <em>four</em>. Six and two threes.</p> <p><strong>Thing is, lads, look, listen mate, it\u2019s Dr Tottenham, they\u2019ve found themselves in this sort of state before; City, in their modern guise, not so often.</strong> Pep not at all. So it\u2019s going to be interesting to watch the gilded champions attempt to bounce back. They don\u2019t particularly enjoy playing Spurs, either, and that\u2019s not even 1981 FA Cup final-infused DNA: Spurs beat City\u2019s reserve team last month in the League Cup, while dealing them last-minute blows on two of their last three visits to the Etihad, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/feb/19/manchester-city-v-tottenham-premier-league-live-score-updates\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/dec/03/manchester-city-v-tottenham-premier-league-live\">here</a>. Those two matches were sandwiched by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/jan/19/manchester-city-v-tottenham-premier-league-live-score-updates\">this one</a>, to be fair, and that\u2019ll be the peg on which City today hang their hat. All of which is a long-winded way of saying, this could be great fun, because recent history \u2013 and indeed both matches of that epic 1981 clash - suggests pretty much <em>anything</em> could happen. <strong>Kick-off is at 5.30pm GMT.</strong> It\u2019s on!</p> </div>   </div>",

Ange Postecoglou speaks to Sky. \u201cIt\u2019s significant in terms of who you\u2019re playing against \u2026 I\u2019m proud of the lads \u2026 resilience and discipline \u2026 City test every aspect of your game and we handled it really well \u2026 we knew they\u2019d come out pretty hot \u2026 they\u2019re a pretty proud club \u2026 I thought we\u2019re going to weather a storm \u2026 we grew into the game \u2026 played some good football \u2026 scored some great goals \u2026 defended as we needed to \u2026 James Maddison was outstanding \u2026 great \u2026 he\u2019s gone through a bit of a lean spell but I\u2019ve never doubted his ability \u2026 when Kulusevski plays wide against City he always causes them problems \u2026 I thought it\u2019d work well \u2026 I take it personally if players aren\u2019t playing to their levels and Madders hasn\u2019t reached his levels and that\u2019s on me to get him back up there \u2026 we\u2019ve done a lot of work \u2026 I felt he was ready to go \u2026 it was an important game for us \u2026 the way the boys reacted \u2026 we stuck together and it reflected in a great performance today \u2026 I think we\u2019re on the right track \u2026 we have to make sure our levels don\u2019t drop \u2026 enjoy it, it doesn\u2019t come along too often.\u201d Pep Guardiola speaks to Sky Sports. \u201cWe started really well \u2026 chances \u2026 the first time they arrived we conceded \u2026 then it was a little bit more difficult \u2026 chances were there \u2026 we cannot handle the duels like we normally are able to \u2026 it cannot happen \u2026 when you play teams in the Premier League you can concede chances \u2026 when you are in the situation we are in, it is tougher \u2026 always in life it can happen \u2026 we have to congratulate Tottenham then look at ourselves \u2026 there a few reasons why we are not able to be consistent \u2026 the balance is not in the right moment \u2026 of course Rodri is important \u2026 there are a lot of little things \u2026 when it is going bad you have to come back with the process \u2026 we have to refresh our minds \u2026 the season is so long \u2026 many things will happen \u2026 the situation is new for us \u2026 you have to accept it and move forward.\u201d For the record, Spurs won that match on the xG as well. But not quite so convincingly. Final score: City 2.15, Spurs 2.51. Birthday boy and player of the match James Maddison, 28 today, talks to Sky. \u201cThese are rare days \u2026 to come to the champions \u2026 especially City \u2026 to come and win 4-0 is special \u2026 these are the days you remember \u2026 it\u2019s important we enjoy it \u2026 28 sounds quite old to me now! \u2026 when you make the sacrifice of missing a birthday, they\u2019re the moments that make it all worth it.\u201d He\u2019s then asked by Jamie Redknapp whether his first goal was a bit of a shinner. \u201cOn my birthday, Jamie, really?!\u201d Full bellows of laughter in the Sky studio for that comeback. This is the first time the champions of England have lost five games in a row, in all competitions, since 1956. The defending champs that season were Chelsea, and that run included a 4-0 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur. Manchester City will desperately hope that\u2019ll be the only coincidence between the two fiascos, because Chelsea \u201856 went on to extend their miserable sequence with two draws and another two defeats. Next up for City: Feyenoord (h), Liverpool (a), Nottingham Forest (h), Crystal Palace (a). Post-match postbag. \u201cWhen you get the fixture list at the beginning of the season, fans of all teams have to be thinking Ipswich at home is your most likely win; City away your most likely defeat. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tottenham Hotspur\u201d \u2013 Tom Atkins \u201cBernardo Silva\u2019s reaction to getting a fully justified yellow card also scored a 10 on the Toddler\u2019s Logic Simulator. Full-on turned-back mode. If I don\u2019t see the ref waving the shiny yellow at me, it didn\u2019t happen. Waaaaah!\u201d \u2013 Paul McGrory \u201cSe\u00f1or Porro refusing to celebrate against a team he never played a game for is a bit of a reach, no?\u201d \u2013 Matthew Lysaght \u201cLadies and gentlemen, the irony is the Spurs manager is still more likely to be sacked at the end of the season. Funny old game, innit?\u201d \u2013 Philip Ritson That result has huge significance for both teams. Tottenham, who were in the bottom half at start of play, are now sixth in the table, right back in the mix. Manchester City meanwhile remain five points behind the leaders Liverpool, who travel to Southampton tomorrow. Should Arne Slot\u2019s team win at St Mary\u2019s, they\u2019ll be eight points clear, and the pressure will be on Pep Guardiola\u2019s side to get something from Anfield next weekend. That is a performance for the ages by Tottenham Hotspur. They\u2019ve been utterly majestic in every single facet of their game. So much so that it\u2019s easy to forget that Manchester City threatened to play them off the park during the opening exchanges. But Spurs held firm, then uncoiled themselves as an attacking force, and City simply couldn\u2019t cope. James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski were outrageously good; Son Heung-min not far behind them in that respect either. City hadn\u2019t lost at the Etihad for 52 matches. But now look! The four-in-a-row champions have lost five on the bounce in all competitions. This is an unprecedented slump for City in their modern guise; Pep has never suffered such a humiliating run in his entire managerial career. But take nothing away from how good Tottenham were. What a way to get their season back on track. Spurs humiliate a Manchester giant on their own field again! Pep with the thousand-yard stare as he congratulates Big Ange. Akanji opts not to intercept a crossfield ball 40 yards from goal. Werner tears off down the left past Walker and rolls into the centre for Johnson, who extends a leg and pokes home from a couple of yards. The Tottenham end en f\u00eate. 90 min +2: Akanji is booked for a cynical tug on Bergvall. 90 min +1: De Bruyne crosses from the right. Haaland prepares to force home, but Dragusin gets in the road, and nothing comes of the resulting corner. Dragusin celebrated that intervention as he would a goal. City might not have been at their best, but Spurs have defended heroically this evening. 90 min: There will be four additional minutes. 89 min: Happy 28th birthday to James Maddison, who already has two goals to his name, and is now announced as player of the match by Gary Neville on Sky. His work done, he leaves the pitch, along with Sarr and Udogie. They\u2019re all replaced by Bergvall, Werner and Spence. 88 min: Kulusevski spins Foden and makes off down the left. He feeds Johnson on the overlap. Johnson rounds Ederson and, from a tight angle, smacks a shot off the bottom of the left-hand post. The offside flag pops up, Kulusevski having taken far too long to make the pass. 87 min: Foden wins a corner down the right. He wants to take it quickly, but can\u2019t do it, because Udogie, having been flicked, takes the opportunity to go down in the box. The City fans are not impressed, but can\u2019t be bothered to keep up the booing for long. They know this is over. 85 min: De Bruyne has made a difference since coming on, as we always knew he would. He pings a ball down the inside-left channel for Gvardiol, who spins into the box and shoots. It\u2019s no good, and the flag goes up for offside anyway. 84 min: Akanji has a dig that is deflected out for a corner. From the set piece, De Bruyne has a whack. Blocked. City come again, Grealish crossing from the left, Silva blazing a volley well over the bar. Despite it all, the hosts haven\u2019t given up hope here. 82 min: Vicario has made some fine stops tonight. Those two in quick succession, from Gundogan and De Bruyne, have really frustrated City as they look for a goal that would jangle a few Spurs nerves. 80 min: De Bruyne slips Haaland into the box down the right. Haaland opens his body and shoots hard. Vicario parries again. De Bruyne tries to meet the rebound, but succeeds in only kicking Sarr. All of which leads to a rare old brouhaha, and both De Bruyne and Sarr are booked for squaring up to each other. City now getting ragged in mind as well as play. 78 min: Silva is booked for a pretty agricultural swipe at Maddison from behind. His subsequent complaint to the referee registers a full 10 on our Chutzpah-o-meter\u2122. 77 min: De Bruyne slips a clever pass down the right channel to release Gundogan, who shoots hard from a tight angle. Vicario stands tall to block with his chest, and nothing comes of the resulting corner. 75 min: A cute shimmy by Silva down the right. He looks for Haaland in the middle, but Porro is on hand to clear. Silva\u2019s skill at least gets the home crowd excited again \u2026 but then Walker blooters a dismal cross out for a goal kick, and the feelgood moment, such as it was, disappears into the ether. 74 min: Here come the cavalry? De Bruyne and Grealish replace Savinho and Lewis. 73 min: Foden wriggles down the inside-left channel and gets a shot away. A pea-roller. It\u2019s easy for Vicario, but it does go down as City\u2019s first strike on target in this second half. 72 min: Walker earns a corner down the right. Foden loops it in. Vicario claims without fuss. 71 min: City pass and probe, probe and pass. Spurs hold their shape. The clock ticks on. 69 min: Gvardiol, who has been decent in attack if nothing else, wedges a cross into the Spurs box from the left. Haaland heads over. 67 min: To be fair to both Kulusevski and Ederson, the keeper still had work to do there, clawing the shot away with a strong hand. 66 min: Solanke barges his way down the middle and suddenly Spurs are three on two. Solanke has options either side, but instead of looking for Maddison to his left, goes for Kulusevski to his right. Kulusevski enters the box but takes too long over the shot, which is eventually slapped straight at Ederson. That \u2013 and this is quite the thing to be saying about a team playing Manchester City away \u2013 should have been four. 64 min: Savinho floats a diagonal cross towards Gvardiol, just inside the Spurs box on the left. Gvardiol slashes an effort of zero threat over the bar. That\u2019s City\u2019s 14th shot so far this evening; they\u2019ve only managed two on target so far. 63 min: Spurs make their first change, replacing Son with Johnson, who will be used to piling forward in the unfettered style after his international sojourn with Craig Bellamy\u2019s freewheeling Wales. 61 min: Silva worms his way down the right and crosses for Gvardiol, who drives towards the bottom left. Porro blocks and clears, and celebrates as though he\u2019s just scored. Which, in fairness, he also has. 60 min: City go back to what they know best - patient probing \u2013 and Ake wins a corner down the left. Spurs deal with it easily enough, Davies heading clear. But suddenly City spring awake, returning the ball into the mixer. Haaland nicks it off Davies on the right-hand edge of the six-yard box, spins, and lashes a shot across Vicario and off the top of the crossbar. So unlucky! 59 min: The rain is coming down in stair-rods now. Even by Mancunian standards, this is quite the downpour. To the great credit of City\u2019s fans, they respond to this miserable state of affairs with an extremely loud rendition of Blue Moon. \u201cTrump heading back to the White House, doomsday fish washing up on the beaches, and City heading to a fifth straight loss? Is this the end of days?\u201d wonders Liz (not the actress) White. 57 min: On Sky, co-commentator Gary Neville suggests that City are being outplayed in every single department. Pep is copping it in the stadium, too. \u201cYou\u2019re getting sacked in the morning,\u201d trill the satirists in the Spurs end. 55 min: Lewis skittles Maddison in the frustrated fashion, and goes into the book. The Spurs fans are making one heck of a racket. Can you blame them? 54 min: Spurs are enjoying playing in Manchester this season, aren\u2019t they? Pep will be rubbing his head even harder now. Kulusevski picks the ball up deep in his own half, beating three men before one-twoing with Son and tearing off down the left. His long cross finds Solanke on the other flank. Solanke enters the box and cuts back for Porro, who lashes an unstoppable shot across Ederson and into the top left! 51 min: Pep Guardiola sits on the bench looking downcast, rubbing his head pensively. 49 min: According to Sky, because I\u2019ve certainly not had the time to do the counting, City are currently 52 matches unbeaten at the Etihad. A lot resting on this second half. 47 min: A strangulated chorus of \u201cWe\u2019re not really here\u201d. It\u2019s a City song, but you wouldn\u2019t blame Spurs fans for co-opting it right now. \u201cCould you ask the non-golfer David Howell if he is the chess grandmaster David Howell?\u201d asks David (not Howell) Gardner. Manchester City get the second half started. They\u2019ve replaced John Stones, whose return from injury has lasted just one half of football, with Nathan Ak\u00e9. Half-time letters (all, in a very strange coincidence, from readers with famous namesakes). \u201cHow in the world is James Maddison 28? He\u2019s had the \u2018promising youngster\u2019 tag for absolutely ages. Is he still promising or has he reached his peak?\u201d \u2013 Andy (not the cricketer) Flintoff \u201cCity is not balanced on the wing, that is why they are being over run. Doku needs to be in to peg back their wing backs. Gundogan needs to be switched out and Nunes in, he has more dynamic power going forward, he is closer to Rodri than Gundo at the moment. Also I would give Haaland a rest. He misses too many easy chances. Let him marinate and come back hungry\u201d \u2013 Kirk (not the actor) Douglas \u201cThis title race really does look like 2019-20 all over again, Which is a terrifying thought, not because I\u2019m not a Liverpool fan, but because parallels to five years ago makes articles like this one even scarier\u201d \u2013 David (not the golfer) Howell \u201cI know what\u2019s really going on here. City\u2019s highly-paid advisors have out-thought the leaden-footed conventional-bound Premier League. If City are convicted of those 115 charges, a punishment of relegation would be moot if they are already demoted, so they will fail to win another game this season, as a kind of situationist jazz happening. City are playing 3-D Chess yet again. Everything connects, Scott. Everything. Connects\u201d \u2013 Paul (not the guy who played piano on Bob Dylan\u2019s classic mid-60s trilogy Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde) Griffin Some much-needed succour for the champions here. Since the start of last season, according to a graphic flashed up by Sky Sports, no team has recovered more points from losing positions than Manchester City. That probably doesn\u2019t come as a huge surprise, but there it is nonetheless. 37: Manchester City 34: Tottenham Hotspur 32: Liverpool 29: Aston Villa City started fast \u2026 then came off the rails. Or more accurately, were barged off them by some sensational Spurs attacking. City are staring down the barrel of a fifth straight defeat in all competitions, though both teams will doubtlessly be thinking about this \u2026 \u2026 so don\u2019t go anywhere. Huge second half coming up! 45 min +2: City are getting frustrated. Walker upends Maddison down the left and then, a free kick conceded, considers slamming the ball into the ground. He thinks twice, just in time. 45 min: \u2026 Akanji harmlessly heads behind. There will be three additional first-half minutes. 44 min: Gvardiol nearly beats Dragusin in a footrace down the left. Not quite, but his presence is enough to win a corner. From which \u2026 43 min: Son has the chance to shoot from just inside the box, but over-thinks things and another chance is gone. City go up the other end, Silva advancing down the left and crossing, Foden scissoring a fine effort over the bar from 12 yards. 42 min: Silva gives the ball away. City have been so careless in possession \u2026 which is a very strange thing to be able to type. Kulusevski tees up Bissouma, who lashes a wild effort high over the bar. 41 min: Vicario is back up and ready to go. 39 min: Vicario goes down again, holding his ankle. On comes the physio. 37 min: Porro deals with a long ball down the middle by heading backwards towards his keeper. Not quite enough power. Savinho nearly nips in, but Vicario claims on the edge of the box, before being clattered by the City attacker. A free kick, nothing more. Savinho was entitled to challenge for that loose ball. 36 min: Savinho sends a drive towards the bottom left from distance. Easy enough for Vicario. 35 min: City probe patiently again. But to no avail. Kulusevski attempts a counter down the left before running the ball out of play. He doesn\u2019t give it back immediately to Silva, who rather petulantly nibbles at his ankles. A fussier referee might have booked both players, but this one merely waves play on dismissively. \u201cIt looks like Pep is playing midfield wannabes in midfield as well,\u201d quips Yash Gupta. 33 min: The harum-scarum pace and shape of this game is suiting Spurs. City decide to take things down a notch or two with some sterile domination. The patient probing leads to a free kick out on the right, near the corner flag. Foden sails the set piece over everyone\u2019s head in the middle. Goal kick. But that\u2019s better from City, who it\u2019s now easy to forget, looked totally on it during the first ten minutes or so. Now, not so much. 31 min: Gvardiol crosses from the left. Savinho connects with a flying header, the ball heading towards the top-left corner. Vicario turns it around the post, then the flag goes up correctly for offside. Savinho \u2013 and Haaland \u2013 were both miles off. Neither had reason to be. 29 min: Spurs flood forward again. This time Son slips a ball down the inside-left channel for Solanke, who takes a touch infield before sending a shot towards the top-right corner. It\u2019s deflected out for a corner, from which nothing comes. Now it\u2019s City who can\u2019t keep on like this. Now it\u2019s Spurs for whom a goal looks simply a matter of time. Funny old game, as Tottenham\u2019s greatest-ever striker once opined. 28 min: It\u2019s not often you can say this without sounding totally preposterous, but City\u2019s midfield is being over-run. Spurs tear through it en masse again, Kulusevski advancing down the right and cutting back, intending to find Son. The Spurs captain is back on his heels, so Akanji is on point to clear. 27 min: Gvardiol looks much better going forward, and he fizzes a low diagonal pass into the Spurs box from the left. Foden picks it up and lashes a first-time shot across Vicario, the keeper\u2019s feet planted, but the ball sails wide right. 25 min: Maddison\u2019s deep corner is punched clear confidently by Ederson. \u201cLooks like Pep didn\u2019t get a chance to read the Ange interview you quoted at 12.16 EST,\u201d writes Jonathan Dugdale. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously spotted that Pep doesn\u2019t bother with real left-backs, just dumping centrebacks or midfield wannabes there.\u201d 24 min: Another Spurs attack. Son sashays past Walker down the left with ease. His low cross hacked out at the near stick by Akanji. Maddison to take. 22 min: This is quite something. City looked in the mood to steamroller Spurs in the opening ten minutes. But Spurs got away with their cold start, and have sprung into life in sensational style! City try to respond, Silva advancing down the left and cutting back for Haaland, who slams a shot over the bar from 12 yards. There could be many more goals in this absurd, wonderfully entertaining game. It\u2019s James Maddison\u2019s 28th birthday today, and he\u2019s having a party. City give the ball away again, Gvardiol playing a poor blind pass in from the right touchline. Maddison snaffles, then rolls across to Son, who holds up the ball on the edge of the area. Maddison has continued running diagonally, and Son finds him with a return down the inside left. Maddison squares up to Ederson and dinks over the keeper and in. Wow! 19 min: Nothing comes of the resulting corner. In the interests of balance, the current scoreline in the aforementioned parallel universe is now 3-3. 18 min: Tottenham suddenly look a different team, and the concern from the City fans is palpable. Some mutterings as they ship possession to Son, 30 yards out. Son opens his body and sends a glorious curler towards the top right. It\u2019s heading in, but Ederson fingertips around the post. 17 min: Son curls a low cross into the box from the left. City are fortunate Kulusevski is on his heels, because had he committed to his run down the middle, he\u2019d be slamming home from six yards. A two-goal lead for Spurs at this point would have been simply wild. 16 min: City clearly aren\u2019t going to let this lie, and Foden reaches for a loose ball to the left of the Spurs D before toe-poking an improvised effort over the bar. A bit lower and either side of the keeper, and Vicario would have had no chance. 15 min: That was a fine goal. Not the greatest defending by Gvardiol, mind you. Perhaps his head\u2019s still spinning after the runaround Ben Doak gave him at Hampden last week. Well this scoreline is absolutely absurd! City could easily be two or three up, but they\u2019re trailing! Kulusevski brushes off Gvardiol down the right. He cuts back before curling a sensational cross over the stranded Stones and towards Maddison, who sidefoots the dropping ball into the bottom left. What a goal! What a weird game football can be sometimes! 11 min: Savinho turns gracefully into space down the left, leaving an over-committed Dragusin flummoxed, and finds Haaland on the penalty spot. Haaland takes a first-time swipe towards the bottom right. Vicario kicks clear. Another huge chance for Haaland, though he was denied by some excellent goalkeeping this time. 10 min: Spurs launch their first attack, Son advancing down the left and whistling a dangerous pass across the face of the six-yard box. But there\u2019s nobody else in white up with play, and Akanji calmly lets the ball through. 9 min: Gundogan shovels a pass down the middle and nearly finds Foden in the middle. Spurs swarm and hack clear, but they can\u2019t keep on like this. Already it feels like a City goal is merely a matter of time. 8 min: Silva nearly finds Walker in the box down the right with a diagonal wedged pass, but there\u2019s too much juice on the ball. Goal kick, though Walker looked offside anyway. Had he managed to extend a leg and divert the pass into the goal, VAR would surely have chalked it off. 6 min: Another corner for City, this time swung in by Gundogan from the left. Maddison manages to get it clear, and the ball is soon back at the feet of Ederson, which qualifies as a minor victory for Spurs, the way both teams have started. 5 min: Nothing comes of the corner. In a parallel universe, Haaland already has two goals to his name this evening. 4 min: City should be leading, and again Haaland is at fault for not putting his side ahead. Gvardiol slips a pass down the inside-right channel and Haaland is free! Simple as that! But his first touch is poor and the time he needs to dig the ball back out from under his feet allows Davies to come across and block the eventual shot out for a corner. 3 min: Gvardiol crosses from the left for Haaland, who strangely doesn\u2019t go for goal from his position on the right-hand corner of the six-yard box. His header back across the face is cleared. But this is a fast start by City. Spurs have barely had a touch since that kick-off fiasco. 2 min: Gundogan sends the resulting free kick towards the far stick. Akanji is unable to turn it goalwards. Goal kick. Spurs get the ball rolling \u2026 and lose it within seconds. Foden advances down the right and Bissouma cynically clips him from behind. The tackle on 12 seconds, the booking on 16. Enjoy the rest of your evening, Yves! Rodri may be missing from the Manchester City line-up, but he\u2019s in the house tonight. The main Etihad lights are dimmed and the influential midfielder comes onto the pitch, kissing his Ballon d\u2019Or before raising it to the sky in front of tall lights that spell out RODRI in Elvis \u201868 Comeback Special style. And then the teams come out, City in blue, Spurs in white. We\u2019ll be off in a minute. Ange Postecoglou talks to Sky. \u201cA lot of internationals are coming back \u2026 Madders has been training with us and is probably one of the fresher ones \u2026 we\u2019re mindful of the fact we\u2019re going to have to have a little of the ball today \u2026 start well that way \u2026 Brennan will play a huge part when he comes on \u2026 when you play City, if you give them too much of the ball they\u2019ll cause you problems \u2026 we\u2019ll probably move Kulusevski wide \u2026 he\u2019s done well against City in that area.\u201d Pep Guardiola is asked by Sky Sports whether his new contract will give his team a positive boost. \u201cPositivity depends on the way we play \u2026 it is how you have to perform \u2026 winning games \u2026 we have had many injuries \u2026 many are now coming back which is good news for us \u2026 it is nice to see players available to play.\u201d He\u2019s also asked who will take up the Rodri role in the Ballon\u2019 d\u2019Or winner\u2019s absence now Mateo Kova\u010di\u0107 is out for a month. Rico Lewis? Pep smiles enigmatically. \u201cYou will see it.\u201d The 3pm kick-offs have finished, and it\u2019s getting tight at the top. Arsenal have beaten Nottingham Forest 3-0 while Brighton won 2-1 at Bournemouth. Throw in Chelsea\u2019s earlier 2-1 victory at Leicester, and the chasing pack are closing in on second-placed City. Meanwhile ten-man Brentford\u2019s staunch goalless draw at Everton pushes Spurs into the bottom half of the table, for a couple of hours at least. Manchester City make three changes in the wake of their 2-1 defeat at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. John Stones, Bernardo Silva and Manuel Akanji are back in; Matheus Nunes and Jahmai Simpson-Pusey drop to the bench, while Mateo Kova\u010di\u0107 is absent through injury. Tottenham also make three changes after their 2-1 loss against Ipswich Town. James Maddison, Yves Bissouma and Ben Davies return to the starting XI, with Brennan Johnson dropping to the bench, Cristian Romero injured, and Rodrigo Bentancur suspended. Manchester City: Ederson, Walker, Stones, Akanji, Gvardiol, Lewis, Gundogan, Silva, Savinho, Foden, Haaland. Subs: Ortega, Ake, Grealish, De Bruyne, Nunes, Wright, Simpson-Pusey, O\u2019Reilly, McAtee. Tottenham Hotspur: Vicario, Porro, Dragusin, Davies, Udogie, Sarr, Bissouma, Maddison, Kulusevski, Son, Solanke. Subs: Forster, Spence, Hardy, Gray, Bergvall, Olusesi, Johnson, Werner, Lankshear. Referee: John Brooks VAR: Michael Salisbury We\u2019ve just had an international break, and yet it feels like these two never went away. They\u2019ve hardly been out of the news all week: Pep Guardiola with his new two-year extension to his Manchester City contract, Spurs dealing with the Bentancur Imbroglio. In that sense there\u2019s more of a feel-good vibe around City right now \u2026 but then Spurs have only lost their last two matches, while City have lost their last four. Six and two threes. Thing is, lads, look, listen mate, it\u2019s Dr Tottenham, they\u2019ve found themselves in this sort of state before; City, in their modern guise, not so often. Pep not at all. So it\u2019s going to be interesting to watch the gilded champions attempt to bounce back. They don\u2019t particularly enjoy playing Spurs, either, and that\u2019s not even 1981 FA Cup final-infused DNA: Spurs beat City\u2019s reserve team last month in the League Cup, while dealing them last-minute blows on two of their last three visits to the Etihad, here and here. Those two matches were sandwiched by this one, to be fair, and that\u2019ll be the peg on which City today hang their hat. All of which is a long-winded way of saying, this could be great fun, because recent history \u2013 and indeed both matches of that epic 1981 clash - suggests pretty much anything could happen. Kick-off is at 5.30pm GMT. It\u2019s on!",

      "body": "<p>It is Friday night on a forested military base in western Finland. A group of women dressed in camouflage with matching purple beanie hats are sat in a dark tent discussing how their perspectives have changed since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was a real threat that Russia would attack us,\u201d says Sari, 42, who works in sales and lives in a nearby town. But then, she adds: \u201cThey attacked Ukraine. I saw that it is possible that we are next.\u201d</p> <p>The mother of two, who describes herself as a \u201crealist\u201d, was moved to join this weekend-long \u201csurviving without electricity\u201d course by her patriotic values, but she also wants to be more prepared with practical skills for day-to-day life. She is one of about 75 women taking part.</p> <p>While a power cut is a situation that could be brought on by a storm \u2013 as happened <a href=\"https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/25788-up-to-100-000-finnish-households-could-be-without-power-as-dawn-breaks-meteorologist-tells-hs.html\">for tens of thousands across Finland</a> last week \u2013 they are also skills that could prove crucial in a potential Russian invasion or hybrid attack.</p> <p>The training course, known as Nasta, is one of 40 put on by the Women\u2019s National Emergency Preparedness Association around Finland. Others include cybersecurity, mental resilience, wilderness skills, snowmobile driving and information influencing. After the invasion of Ukraine, applications for the courses soared. Not only does Finland have a history of war with its neighbour, but they also share a 830-mile land border.</p>    <p>Tytti, 36, has felt so anxious about relations with Finland\u2019s hostile neighbour that she has been avoiding the news. Attending the course, she says, \u201cis my way to confront my fears\u201d.</p> <p>Both women have been on one-day shooting courses in the last year or so, but do not like handling guns.</p> <p>In the short term, Hannele, 67, is more afraid of the kind of hybrid warfare Finland is already experiencing, such as cyberwarfare and disinformation, than the prospect of imminent military combat. She is surprised by how many young women have been taking up arms. Still, she is curious to know: \u201cHow does it feel to shoot something?\u201d</p> <p>Until a few hours ago, most of the women, the youngest of whom is 18 and the oldest 70, did not know each other. But on this sub-zero snowy night in Lohtaja, near the town of Kokkola, they have already set up camp under a tall canopy of pines by torchlight, made a wood fire in a burner at the centre of the big military tent and made a plan for where everybody is going to sleep.</p> <p>Throughout the weekend, the group will learn how to survive in a crisis \u2013 including how to build and put out fires, cook outside, deliver first aid, stay warm and build a toilet.</p> <p>There is a rota for keeping the fire stoked overnight. Some of the group are using a big piece of tarpaulin to fix a leak in the tent.</p>    <p>While there is no official military interaction between the two neighbours, Finnish intelligence services describe Russia as Finland\u2019s greatest national security threat and is in little doubt there is a hybrid war under way.</p> <p>Last week, the Finnish foreign minister, Elina Valtonen, released a joint statement with her German counterpart expressing her \u201cdeep concern\u201d about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/baltic-sea-cables-damage-sabotage-german-minister\">suspected sabotage</a> \u2013 one of two in the Baltic \u2013 of an undersea cable between Finland and Germany.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that such an incident immediately raises suspicions of intentional damage speaks volumes about the volatility of our times,\u201d it said. Finland has since launched a joint investigation with Sweden, which, like Finland, has become a Nato member since the invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>Helsinki also accuses Russia of using proxies, including asylum seekers, to aggravate its neighbour; there have been suspicious break-ins at water treatment facilities and issues with GPS jamming.</p> <p>Nasta has been running since 1997. Although its training is non-military, it is part-funded by the Finnish Ministry of Defence and receives substantial support from Finland\u2019s National Defence Training Association<strong>. </strong>It has a membership of approximately 100,000. In the aftermath of Russia\u2019s invasion on 24 February 2022, interest surged to unprecedented levels.</p> <p>There were so many people queueing for a place on the courses that the system collapsed, says Suvi Aksela,<strong> </strong>Nasta\u2019s communications and organisation manager, who compares getting a place on one of the subsidised courses to getting in-demand concert tickets. \u201cSometimes the courses are full within one minute.\u201d</p> <p>In the days after the invasion, the phone calls \u201cjust kept coming and coming and coming\u201d, she says. The first question was often \u201cwhat can I do?\u201d And the second was \u201cwhere can I learn how to shoot?\u201d The third, she adds, was \u201chow I can I find out about my bunker?\u201d A recent inventory by the interior ministry found that Finland has 50,500 bunkers for its population of 5.6 million \u2013 part of the legacy of a Soviet Union attempt to invade the country during the second world war.</p> <p>\u201cThe shooting bit kind of surprised me,\u201d says Aksela. \u201cBecause we have our military personnel \u2013 the soldiers, the professionals \u2013 then we have a huge amount of reservists. If I am the one that has to pick up the gun, then we\u2019re in deep trouble.\u201d</p> <p>The popularity of shooting in Finland has soared in the last two years. Earlier this year, the government announced a plan to open more than 300 new shooting ranges to encourage people to take it up as a hobby to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/19/finland-to-open-more-shooting-ranges-amid-russia-threat#:~:text=Finland%20plans%20to%20open%20more,the%20interest%20of%20national%20defence.\">bolster national defence</a>. The number of Finns applying for gun licences has also risen significantly.</p> <p>Aksela advises callers to start with their at-home contingencies. Finnish households are encouraged to have enough supplies to survive unaided for at least 72 hours \u2013 food, water, medicine and access to a battery-powered radio \u2013 in case of an emergency.</p> <p>The courses are most popular among university educated middle-aged women from the Helsinki area, says Aksela. As well as Russia\u2019s close proximity to Finland, the collective memory of fighting the Soviet Union during the second world war also plays a significant role in informing the seriousness with which the perceived threat from Russia is taken by the Finnish public.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of our history. It\u2019s because of, obviously, our location. The neighbour isn\u2019t very friendly, hasn\u2019t been \u2013 even before [2022]. So we\u2019re just very aware of the risks. A lot of countries let go of their conscription, Finland never did. So for us it\u2019s common sense,\u201d says Aksela.</p> <p>The obligation to contribute to national defence is part of the Finnish constitution and all men are required to undertake military service (women can apply but on a voluntary basis).</p> <p>The Finnish intelligence and security service, Supo, has warned that Russia treats Finland as an unfriendly state and as a target for espionage and \u201cmalign influence activities\u201d.</p> <p>The Supo deputy director, Teemu Turunen, said hybrid war is coming in multiple forms, including via proxies, cyberattacks, threat to critical infrastructure, disinformation and espionage. Russia, he said, is using asylum seekers as \u201ctools for their own purposes\u201d by inadequately guarding the Russian-Finnish border, which is why the eastern border remains closed and has been for most of the last year.</p> <p>\u201cThe modus operandi of Russian intelligence services is more aggressive, it\u2019s a more serious threat and they are using other means,\u201d he said, including a threat to critical infrastructure and sabotage.</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that this is the number one threat to Finnish national security: Russian state actors. And even blurring the lines between using proxy criminal organisations or other types of proxies.\u201d</p> <p>But, he said, it is important not to assume Russia is behind every potential incident. \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that Russia is not omnipotent. They are trying to exaggerate their capabilities.\u201d Russia has more urgent priorities than Finland, he added, such as its own stability and the war in Ukraine. \u201cSo it is not that Russia could do anything, anywhere, anytime. They try to make us fear that, but it\u2019s not the case.\u201d</p> <p>Asked how the election of Donald Trump affects Finland\u2019s security and preparedness, he warned \u201cthe threat from the Russian side is not going away\u201d and that as the US increasingly turns its focus to China, Europe must \u201cstep up and improve preparedness\u201d.</p> <p>Finns, he said, are \u201cquite cool-headed about the threat\u201d, but preparedness is at the heart of that. \u201cIntelligent preparedness as well as societal resilience. It\u2019s all part of the whole-of-society approach that Finland has and we have had for a long time already.\u201d</p> <p>But at the Nasta course, many have been activated by more recent events.</p> <p>Walking back to camp from breakfast, the ground white with fresh snow, Aija Kuukkanen tells me she first tried to sign up for a course in spring 2022. \u201cI had seen these kinds of courses previously, I knew they existed, but the final decision was because of this war,\u201d the 58-year-old, who works in a tractor factory, says. \u201cI wanted to get more information and get prepared somehow.\u201d</p> <p>Merja Majanen, 67, a retired bank manager from Rovaniemi, who has run disinformation courses in her home town, says the fact that hundreds of women have travelled from around Finland to do these courses is proof of the level of anxiety.</p> <p>She takes comfort from not living close to the Russian border. \u201cIf I lived in the eastern parts of Lapland, I would be even more concerned.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cAnother week, another record defeat.\u201d These are the sobering opening words from Andy Bull\u2019s report that has just landed. And with those words, I\u2019ll sign off. Thank you to everyone who wrote in. I hope you enjoyed that. Even the Welsh supporters among us. \u201cWales never gave up,\u201d declares KR Lauf. \u201cBig respect to Wales who did not give up....Dyer and Botham\u2019s tries came at the end of each half, after physical batterings..still they endured.\u201d No doubt. Huw Rees has some choice words for the man in charge: \u201cI\u2019ve been a fan of Gatland, and the loss of 5 line outs is down to the players. However the one up runners are there to be turned over, that\u2019s down to coaching, how you attack. Archie Griffin, his arse was higher than his shoulders on all his scrums, that\u2019s poor technique, and Jonathan Humphreys is not a good coach. Time for the coaching team to go.\u201d You know what\u2026 I agree. Now Warren Gatland: Our boys tried really hard out there. They gave it everything and that\u2019s all I can ask. They\u2019ll learn from that. They are clinical and that\u2019s why they are world champions. They\u2019ll learn a massive amount. Hopefully there is a step-up when they play next time. It\u2019s about seeing what the union will say [about his future]. It\u2019s always tough doing a press conference straight after a game. Let\u2019s see what happens over the next few days. I needed to see a shift today from the players and I can\u2019t ask any more from how much they tried. That score could have completely blown out but they kept trying for 80 minutes. We need to be better conditioned and that\u2019s a big work on for some of them as we build towards the Six Nations. It\u2019s been challenging over the last couple of weeks. I\u2019m only human. It\u2019s tough. But the amount of people that have contacted me \u2013 coaches, fans, players, people from the media \u2013 who have wished me well, that has made a huge difference. We\u2019ve punched massively above our weight for a number of years. The dam has burst. We have to make sure that we work together with the regions. We have to be in better shape in terms of conditioning. So that when the players turn up for the Six nations they\u2019re ready to go. Here\u2019s Siya Kolisi: It hasn\u2019t been perfect. We were happy we won the first two matches but it could have been better. Obviously the results are important. But it\u2019s how you do things. [Tony Brown \u2013 the new attack coach] has been big for us. We keep learning new stuff. It\u2019s not the same game plan. There are younger guys pushing. We have so much respect for Wales. I have no doubt they\u2019ll pick it up. Jamie Roberts has emphasised what a \u201cprivilege\u201d it is to play at the Principality. Sam Warburton has stressed the fan experience at the stadium and promised that \u201cWelsh rugby will be back\u201d. These are bleak days. Here\u2019s Dewi Lake: Physically it was the toughest Test (of the year). We showed a lot of heart and character. They\u2019re world champions for a reason. We\u2019re not there yet. Errors cost us again. They\u2019re tough to stop when they\u2019re rolling on the ball. I can\u2019t question the effort. We have to keep the faith. The second we lose that faith it\u2019s pointless stepping onto the field. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Sometimes the journey is more important than the destination. We\u2019ll never get tired of putting on the jersey. Simon Williams has mixed emotions after that: \u201cNot nice to watch from someone whose father was born in Cardiff, myself in Cape Town. Wales is always my 2nd team and it\u2019s sad to see them in disarray, but remember Wales are a proud and champion rugby nation and it wasn\u2019t that long ago that the Springboks were 7th in the world. Wales will endure.\u201d Here\u2019s the player of the match, Franco Mostert: Credit to Wales. We knew it was going to be a tough game. [Was it though?] Coach Rassie said we are here to get better. Last week our performance was a little individual. This weekend we focussed on playing as a team. As players we back our coaches and management. The way they bring in new guys. That\u2019s that. Wales close out the year winless. What a disaster 2024 has been for them. South Africa weren\u2019t anywhere near their best and yet scored seven tries and to confirm their status as the world\u2019s best team. Botham gets his reward! If there\u2019s one player who has stood up, it\u2019s Botham. From the line-out, Wales ground their way within striking distance before Botham wrestled his way over. The extras are added, but that doesn\u2019t add any gloss. 79th min: Mostert c elebrates his recognition by committing a penalty inside his own 22. So Wales will get the final say with a line-out five metres out. Franco Mostern wins player of the match. Too right. He\u2019s been brilliant. Seventh heaven! Beautiful off-load from Reinach who finds his fly-half on the support line in the left tram. Pollard got things going with a busting charge through midfield. Reinach then picked up off the back of the ruck, straightened, freed his hands and found Hendrikse. The number 10 dusted himself off and slotted the extra two points from close to the touchline. 74th min: A quick exchange of penalties. First Snyman then Thomas. So it\u2019s a quick ding-dong of territory that settles with a South African line-out, following a punt to touch, inside Wales\u2019 half, about 10 metres in from the half-way line on the right. 72nd min: Wales get the ball back. A more clinical South Africa would have reached the half-century mark by now. But a nothing kick from James finds Arendse in space and he finds Fassi who charges through the encroaching defence. He kicks ahead but it\u2019s too long. Line-out to Wales who choose to clear their their 22 so we settle with a Boks throw around half-way. The game is meandering towards a conclusion. 69th min: Oh dear. Wales make a mess of another line-out and they give away possession inside their own half with a knock-on. Nothing has gone right, has it? Scrum to the Boks on half-way towards the left touch. 68th min: The ball somehow bobbles out on the Welsh side of the scrum following a South African feed, but there was a penalty awarded against the Welsh. That\u2019s their sixth they\u2019ve conceded at the set-piece and Dickson has given Morgan a final team warning. 65th min: Wales get the chance to kick to touch from a penalty and will get the line-out inside the Boks\u2019 22. There was a heart in mouth moment for Watkin who seemed to have tip tackled Kolbe, but he actually set him down safely. South Africa win possession back but inexplicably choose to run the ball from inside their own in-goal area. Kolisi is smashed by Hathaway and dumped out of touch. But the Boks had the scrum advantage after a Welsh spill and Reinach will put in five out from his own own try line. Inevitable. Just relentless. The scrum under the poles was unplayable and Hanekom tapped and went. he almost knocked on but kept control of the ball. Then they came. Big units running hard at the line. Wales just couldn\u2019t keep them out and eventually, from close range, Steenkamp rumbled over. Hendrikse, still kicking while Pollard is on the field, slots the conversion from the right touchline. 61st min: South Africa win the scrum penalty five metres out. They choose to pack down again. Jaden Hendrikse makes way for Reinach. Van Staden on for Wiese who made 109 metres from 19 carries. Immense. 60th min: The line-out provides front-foot ball for the Boks. They keep hammering the line. Wales hold them out but illegally. So it\u2019s another South African penalty right under the poles. Lake makes way with Elias coming on. They choose the scrum. 57th min: A couple of knock-ons in the space of a few minutes, first from Kolbe then from Thomas, means we have a South African scrum around half-way. They get a penalty and so have a free hit. Nothin\u2019 doin\u2019 so we come back for the pen. I doubt they\u2019ll go for poles. Yup, into the corner from Hendrikse. 10 metres out for a line-out. Deadly from the Boks back three. Arendse the provider this time as he counters, welcomes the contact, off-loads to Fassi on the support line to his left and the fullback is away, sliding over in the corner. The conversion fails, but that\u2019s a wonder score with a wonder assist. 52nd min: OH NO! Lake over-throws from the line-out five out from the Boks\u2019 line and Hendrikse gathers and takes it away. The clearing kick finds the half-way line and that is a major let-off for South Africa. About sums up the Welsh year to be honest. Lake then attempts a chip and chase and it gives away possession. That\u2019s a torrid minute for the skipper. Now South Africa have a line-out on Wales\u2019 22. 51st min: Another penalty agains the Boks. They\u2019re getting a bit messy. This one\u2019s inside their 22, not far from their line. Wales will have another line-out. Their catch and drive from the set-piece has worked well. Pollard comes on for de Allende to bring some composure. 49th min: Arendse claims a good grab in the air. Murray does likewise but is clattered. Still, Wales have the ball back inside their own half. Fassie gathers under pressure from Dyer following a deep box kick but gets the off-load away. Now Fassie kicks. It\u2019s a little loose by the Boks and a stray elbow from a South African on Thomas gives Wales the penalty. So they\u2019ll kick to the corner and take a shot from a line-out. 48th min: A slick off-load from Snyman sparks a move and then Arendse wriggles through a half-gap and is motoring up field at pace. Kolbe has it and then to goes down the line. Fassie now into the 22 on the left touchline. But a massive hit from Morgan on Hanekom gives Botham the chance to steal in and make the pinch on the ground. Not for the first time, this is fantastic defence and jackaling from the Welsh. Thomas comes on to make his debut. Plumtree the man to make way. 45th min: Nevermind. South Africa get the scrum penalty. Asseratti the guilty man there. Hendrikse hoofs to touch and here comes the Bomb Squad. Marx, Steenkamp and Koch for du Toit, Grobelaar and Louw. 43rd min: South Africa get within touching distance near the left corner with strong carries from de Allende and then Snyman, but the big lock had his pocket picked after a dominant double shot from Smith and Plumtree. A little while later Wales get a scrum inside South Africa\u2019s half after a de Allende knock-on. So a handy few minutes for the home side. Decent striking distance in the middle of the pitch just outside the 22. 42nd min: South Africa hit their straps. Fassie heavily involved, first distributing from second receiver, then running a superb support line off Hendrikse\u2019s shoulder, then almost stitching a pass back in-field as he combines with Arendse. That was delightful. They stepped out so Wale have the throw on their 22. Hanekom comes on to win his debut. They\u2019re back out on the park. Can Wales pull off a comeback? No. Probably not. But that try late in the first half should give them a lift. Can they explode out the blocks for the second? Let\u2019s see\u2026 \u201cHope Etzebet is OK.\u201d Says Harold [no surname]. \u201dBoks must be careful not to get too complacent.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t worry about that. \u201cI was expecting SA to win but ....didn\u2019t think they\u2019d be leading 179-0 at this stage. Thanks Giles B, and David Manby. This is reference to a typo of mine after Arendse\u2019 try. In my defence, the spirit of this game reflects that score. And let\u2019s not discount the Boks stacking on another 153 points in the second half. That\u2019ll be that. One-sided doesn\u2019t quite cut it. Sure, Wales had the final say, but two South Africans were held up over the line and four more dotted down. Even this gulf on the scoreboard doesn\u2019t convey the gulf on the pitch. Dyer scores a stunner! Once again with penalty advantage following a strong maul off the line-out, and several big carries, Dyer finds the right corner on the opposite side of the field. Kriel made a great defensive read and looked to have stifled the attack Wales went down the backline, but Dyer got the ball in space, pinned his ears back and found the corner. The conversion is wide but at least Wales have a score before half-time. 39th min: Much, much better from Wales. After the line-out they maintained their phase play and shape. They went right from the set-piece but couldn\u2019t break through with strong carries. South Africa keep them out but illegally so another penalty goes the way of the Welsh. Another line-out. Another maul. Another penalty advantage. Mostert collapsed the maul. Will they got for another line-out? Indeed they will. 37th min: South Africa commit a penalty after the restart so Wales kick to the corner and get a chance to land a blow of their own. They win the line-out and their maul is strong and secure. Can they get this over the line? There\u2019s the fourth! South Africa\u2019s scrum consumed the Welsh pack, won a penalty and the try was inevitable from there. Wiese picked up and carried a metre short. But Elrigh Louw finished it with a muscular statement under the poles. The conversion just adds more woe for the home side. 33rd min: Kolisi has dotted over the line but they\u2019re going to check if there wasn\u2019t an infringement in the build up. Indeed there is! Jaden Hendrikse spilled it at the base of a ruck. That\u2019s a shame. Just about every Bok was involved in a move rich with quick hands and off-loads. They\u2019re playing a different sport than their hosts. Wales have another scrum to survive near their own line. 32nd min: A third Welsh player makes a tackle on a man in the air. Hathaway this time as he took Fassie out. Having won a turnover on South Africa\u2019s ball moments earlier, it\u2019s just poor. Gatland can\u2019t do anything about that. That\u2019s just not good enough at Test level. 31st min: Wales get the ball out without any danger. Plumtree carries well under pressure. A clearing kick takes it out between halfway and their 22 so the Boks will come again from the line-out. 30th min: The brothers almost combine for a worldie! Jaden\u2019s little dink kick from the back of the ruck is perfectly timed to meet Jordan\u2019s blind run through the Welsh line. But it bobbles awkwardly and he knocks on around his knees. Eztebeth must have taken a nasty knock as he is leaving the field looking a little groggy. The equally large RG Snyman enters the scene. Wales have the scrum five metres from their own line. 29th min: Off the line-out, the Boks work a nifty move down the left with de Allende involved in the build-up. They keep possession and snake left and then back right with short carries from the big units. 15 phases before a cross-field kick finds Kolbe on the left wing. The little man leaps and knocks it back for Fassie who collects and dives over the line, but heroic holds him up and prevents the ball from being dotted down. 26th min: Thomas du Toit wins the scrum penalty. They\u2019re just so dominant in so many areas. Hendrikse then hoofs a big kick to touch and we\u2019re back in Welsh territory for a South African throw. 23rd min: Wales will get a rare touch of the ball after a knock-on by the Boks around half-way. They take it on with a stiff carry from their captain, Lake. Costelow then kicks highand Fassie knocks on. So it\u2019ll be another scrum for Wales about 10 metres into enemy territory. 21st min: There\u2019s just no respite for Wales. A second tackle in the air in 20 minutes concedes a penalty straight from the restart. So frustrating. Hendrikse goes for distance but doesn\u2019t find touch. Costelow (back on the field after a head check) kicks it out around half-way. And another! And it was so simple. Mostert takes the line-out and Hendrkise then fizzes it down the line. Nothing special. Just fast and accurate. Arendse, on the left wing catches a looping pass from Fassie and then steps off his left foot and rounds the two covering defenders. Hendrikse converts as It\u2019s falling apart for Wales. 19th min: Another penalty inside Wales\u2019 22. Llewellyn with a tackle off the ball. he got sucked into buying the decoy run of Fassi. South Africa have already made 267 metres to Wales\u2019 33. They\u2019ll have another line-out five out. It\u2019s one-way traffic so far. 17th min: Wales hold firm|! Brilliant defence. First their scrum held their own and forc ed messy ball for Hendrikse at the base. Wiese picked up and went himself but couldn\u2019t bust through. Etzebeth was then crunched by Smith. Kolisi then had a dart but Morgan did brilliantly to hold him up over the line. 14th min: Wales do well to lift a jumper and disrupt the line-out. But they spill the ball. So South Africa will get a five metre scrum. Out of the frying pan and into the fire for the home side. 13th min: The Boks get a rumble on from their maul, but there\u2019s a penalty as the Welsh disrupt it illegally. That might be the final straw before a yellow is shown. Another line-out chance for SA. This time about five metres out. 13th min: Slick line-out work and Arendse, off his wing, takes it on a wraparound move from de Allende and busts over the 22 line on the right. Plumtree gets in a tangle at a breakdown and is penalised. Hendrikse punts it closer to the line. SA with the throw about seven out. 11th min: Wales are off-side so they get a penalty inside their own half. They\u2019re chucking it about, even under pressure Jordan Hendrikse chucked a tough pass to Kriel who took the contact. But the penalty allows Hendrikse to kick towards Wales\u2019 22 for a line-out. Both locks have scored! They\u2019re running riot! It started with stiff counter ruck that robbed Wales of the ball. Then it was all too easy as quick hands found Arendse on the left wing and in a flash he was cantering up the field. A simple pass back inside found the big unit in support and he charged over the try line. The conversion is missed, but this already looks like it could get messy. South Africa are on the board! A brilliant line from Mostert is totally missed by wales near the right wing and Jaden Hendrikse hits the big man at pace and he\u2019s through a gap. It started with a run from Arendse that sparked a move down the line before Kolbe barged into the 22. South Africa then dominated the breakdown and kept their momentum moving forward. Wales\u2019 line splintered and Mostert picked his moment to perfection. The conversion is good and the Boks are away. 5th min: Elrigh Louw claims the line-out at the back of the line-out and Hendrikse then Wiese take it close to the line. They\u2019re five out as they go from right to left. But Botham gets low and wins a crucial penalty on his own line. That is a fantastic steal. Wilco Louw guilty of holding on there after he charged over the gainline. 4th min: Costelow has started well. He takes a high ball under pressure. Hendrikse then gets clattered as he catches a high kick but soon Kriel is over the gainline courtesy of a cross-field kick to to the left wing. But we come back for the penalty as Dyer took Hendrikse out in the air. The Boks hoof it ling and they\u2019ll get the line-out inside Wales\u2019 22. 2nd min: Costelow\u2019s kick-off is deep and Jordan Hendrikse boots it out around half-way. Morgan charges to the line. Costelow carries well. Lake too. Early continuity from the Welsh until Costelow launched a high kick that is claimed by Jordan Hendrkise. They\u2019re playing their own game right now. Wales in white with green shorts by the way. Maybe that\u2019s the change they needed. Tell you what, that was a moving rendention of Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau. No matter the context, the Welsh know how to back their boys. Tears in the eyes of Lake and Dyer. If they can bring that to the pitch we might have a game. The players are stood in their rows, two of rugby\u2019s best anthems are about to get going. Not long now\u2026 Here\u2019s what the coaches had to say before kick-off: Warren Gatland: Last week\u2019s result hurts, and we are just as disappointed by it as the fans. There were good elements that we can definitely build on going into Saturday, but we have to improve our accuracy. We know what a quality side South Africa are and the physicality they bring. This week we need to show real courage and front-up against the world champions. Rassie Erasmus: This is our last match of the season, and we are determined to finish the year on a positive note. Wales are a proud nation with a world-renowned coach in Warren and they\u2019ll do everything to finish their campaign on a high note. We\u2019d love to finish the tour unbeaten, but we are well aware of the fact that we\u2019ve have a few close results against them over the years at the Principality Stadium. Wales have won the coin toss. So far so good for the underdogs. \u201cI do care passionately about Welsh rugby and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve said that if people feel that the best decision is for me to go, then that\u2019s OK, I\u2019ll move on and look for something else,\u201d Gatland said this week. \u201cI honestly believe that if you make that decision now, what are you going to achieve? Is someone else going to come in there and start again, how long is that process going to take? What players are available to us at the moment that are potentially going to affect results?\u201d Fighting words from one of the game\u2019s greatest scrappers. But surely the end is nigh? When Cameron Hanekom takes the field to win his Test debut, he\u2019ll become the 51st player used by Rassie Erasmus this year. Ordinarily such chopping and changing is a sing that things aren\u2019t going so well (Wayne Pivac used 50 Welsh players in 2020 and Dave Rennie used 51 Australians in 2022). But the Boks are on course to win their 11th Test from 13 in a season that includes a Rugby Championship title. South Africa\u2019s dominance over the oval ball is often inflated by their passionate supporters. France, New Zealand and Ireland, one their day, can certainly challenge them. But there\u2019s no question we\u2019re in the midst of one of the great dynasties in the sport\u2019s history. \u201cGatland has seemed like a sacked man working, if not a dead man walking, ever since he said he was willing to resign if it was in \u201cthe best interests of the Welsh game\u201d after they were beaten 52-20 by Australia last Sunday\u201d This was punchy stuff from Andy Bull who also argues that Gats is \u201ca good man, and was a great coach\u201d but that it\u2019s \u201cbeginning to feel like his last act of service to the Welsh game will be to take the blame for its failings, and, by doing so, force it to finally confront the state it is in.\u201d I\u2019m not sure where I stand. All I know is that if the coach of my national team had publicly announced his intention/willingness to step away from the job twice in the same year, I\u2019d be demanding he leave as swiftly as possible. Two brothers \u2013 Jordan and Jaden Hendrikse \u2013 start together in the half-backs for the first time. Outside of them is a ton of experience as the in the backline. In front of them it\u2019s a slightly rejigged pack. Eben Etzebeth was supposed to start off the bench but a late injury to Jean Kleyn means the 130-cap veteran wears the 4 jersey. Keep an eye out for debutant Cameron Hanekom off the bench. Many back home have predicted a bright future for the rampaging loose forward. South Africa: Aphelele Fassie; Cheslin Kolbe, Jesse Kriel, Damian de Allende, Kurt-Lee Arendse; Jordan Hendrikse, Jaden Hendrikse; Thomas du Toit, Johan Grobellar, Wilco Louw, Eben Eztebeth; Franco Mostert, Siya Kolisi (c), Elrigh Louw, Jasper Wiese. Replacements: Malcolm Marx, Gerhard Steenkamp, Vincent Koch, Marco van Staden, RG Snyman, Cameron Hanekom, Cobus Reinach, Handre Pollard. There have been four late changes to the side that was originally selected. Not sure if that\u2019s a sign of chaos in the ranks but it is a rare late shuffle for sure. Winger Josh Hathaway and prop Nicky Smith start in place of Tom Rogers and Gareth Thomas. Kemlsey Mathias and Owen Watkin take their place on a handy looking bench. But I fear none of this will make much of a difference. Still, what an opportunity to do your country proud. Wales: Blair Murray; Josh Hathaway, Max Llewellyn, Ben Thomas, Rio Dyer; Sam Costelow, Ellis Bevan; Nicky Smith, Dewi Lake (c), Archie Griffin, Will Rowlands, Christ Tchiunza, Jac Morgan, Taine Plumtree. Replacements: Ryan Elias, Kemsley Mathias, Kieron Assiratti, Freddie Thomas, Tommy Reffell, Rhodri Williams, Eddie James, Owen Watkin. If you like your Test rugby tight and hotly contested, you\u2019ve probably come to the wrong place. Of course anything can happen, but this would go down as one of the greatest shocks in the sport\u2019s history if Wales \u2013 winless this year \u2013 manage to topple the Springboks. Warren Gatland, Wales\u2019 beleaguered coach, used to work miracles and achieve success despite the struggles of the domestic set-up. But he\u2019s either lost his mojo or run out of players who can make up for those shortcomings because he heads into the most difficult challenge in rugby right now on the back of 11 straight defeats. For those wondering, that makes this the worst Welsh side in the country\u2019s history. Anything other than a crushing 12th loss would constitute an upset. Rassie Erasmus, South Africa\u2019s coach, has no space for sentiment or sympathy. He\u2019s selected a formidable side (more on that later) and will expect to close 2024 with an 11th win from 13 Tests. This would also make it a clean sweep from their European tour, their first since 2013. But if Wales are to go down let them at least go down with pride. Even a disappointing result can have a silver lining after all and there are thousands of loyal Welsh supporters who deserve to put this torrid year behind them with an inkling of goodwill in their hearts. Kick off at 5:40pm. Teams and further updates to come.",

But Southampton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/02/southampton-everton-premier-league-match-report\">victory over Everton</a> was followed immediately by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/09/wolves-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">defeat by Wolves</a> and so they spent the international break bottom of the table. They have taken four points from 11 games. In only two games this season have Southampton had the better xG \u2013 on the opening day, when they lost 1-0 at 10-man Newcastle, and in the 1-1 draw at Ipswich. They are, barring something miraculous, doomed.</p> <p>The routine has become familiar. Southampton play their goal-kicks short. They pass the ball neatly. They have a lot of possession; 56.6% \u2013 only three teams in the Premier League are averaging more. They don\u2019t take their chances \u2013 no side have hit a lower percentage of shots on target this season. Somebody makes a mistake \u2013 perhaps one of their players, perhaps the referee \u2013 they concede and the game is lost.</p> <p>Their manager, Russell Martin, looking ruggedly masculine but in touch with his feelings, then speaks sadly and patiently about his belief in playing football the right way. Then everybody else weighs in. Some are supportive because they genuinely believe the journey is more important than the destination. Some are supportive because it was playing that style of football that got Southampton promoted and they think that\u2019s their best hope of staying up. Some accuse Martin of naivety, perhaps even arrogance or self-absorption. Does he have to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/16/russell-martin-southampton-premier-league\">change his approach</a>?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/20/career-we-go-footballers-who-played-here-there-and-everywhere\">Career we go: a look at footballers who played here, there and everywhere</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To which there is no right answer. In football there very rarely is. Should a promoted manager adapt? Perhaps; it worked for Thomas Frank at Brentford. But there is a danger in sudden switches. Why should players assembled to play in a particular way be able to adjust to playing another? While it possibly is true that a simpler, more risk-averse style might benefit a team low on confidence, it\u2019s very unlikely to help a struggling side if they stop playing to their strengths.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the more nebulous point that a lot of management is essentially a confidence trick, persuading players to have faith in the process or the messianic charisma of the leader so they achieve transcendence by sacrificing themselves for the greater good. Start ripping up the doctrine and it can be no great surprise if doubt sets in.</p> <p>The way in which the relationship between players and coach maps on to religious language is itself significant, a means by which the discourse subtly shapes expectation. Modern managers are expected to have philosophies, and to evangelise them in their dealings with the media. Pep Guardiola, say, has spoken of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/07/pep-guardiola-exclusive-interview-johan-cruyff-unique#:~:text=Pep%20Guardiola%3A%20'I%20would%20not,'%20%7C%20Pep%20Guardiola%20%7C%20The%20Guardian\">how Johan Cruyff \u201cbuilt the cathedral\u201d</a> at Barcelona and it being the job of subsequent coaches to maintain it.</p> <p>The result is that football can be made to seem a battle of competing ideologies, while a manager deviating from his pre-stated ideals is regarded almost as an apostate. Even the most self-assertive managers can seem uneasy about stepping away from the one true path.

      "bodyText": "There has, at least, been a win to break the pattern. But Southampton\u2019s victory over Everton was followed immediately by defeat by Wolves and so they spent the international break bottom of the table. They have taken four points from 11 games. In only two games this season have Southampton had the better xG \u2013 on the opening day, when they lost 1-0 at 10-man Newcastle, and in the 1-1 draw at Ipswich. They are, barring something miraculous, doomed. The routine has become familiar. Southampton play their goal-kicks short. They pass the ball neatly. They have a lot of possession; 56.6% \u2013 only three teams in the Premier League are averaging more. They don\u2019t take their chances \u2013 no side have hit a lower percentage of shots on target this season. Somebody makes a mistake \u2013 perhaps one of their players, perhaps the referee \u2013 they concede and the game is lost. Their manager, Russell Martin, looking ruggedly masculine but in touch with his feelings, then speaks sadly and patiently about his belief in playing football the right way. Then everybody else weighs in. Some are supportive because they genuinely believe the journey is more important than the destination. Some are supportive because it was playing that style of football that got Southampton promoted and they think that\u2019s their best hope of staying up. Some accuse Martin of naivety, perhaps even arrogance or self-absorption. Does he have to change his approach? To which there is no right answer. In football there very rarely is. Should a promoted manager adapt? Perhaps; it worked for Thomas Frank at Brentford. But there is a danger in sudden switches. Why should players assembled to play in a particular way be able to adjust to playing another? While it possibly is true that a simpler, more risk-averse style might benefit a team low on confidence, it\u2019s very unlikely to help a struggling side if they stop playing to their strengths. Then there\u2019s the more nebulous point that a lot of management is essentially a confidence trick, persuading players to have faith in the process or the messianic charisma of the leader so they achieve transcendence by sacrificing themselves for the greater good. Start ripping up the doctrine and it can be no great surprise if doubt sets in. The way in which the relationship between players and coach maps on to religious language is itself significant, a means by which the discourse subtly shapes expectation. Modern managers are expected to have philosophies, and to evangelise them in their dealings with the media. Pep Guardiola, say, has spoken of how Johan Cruyff \u201cbuilt the cathedral\u201d at Barcelona and it being the job of subsequent coaches to maintain it. The result is that football can be made to seem a battle of competing ideologies, while a manager deviating from his pre-stated ideals is regarded almost as an apostate. Even the most self-assertive managers can seem uneasy about stepping away from the one true path. The bullishly self-assured Netherlands manager Louis van Gaal, when he unexpectedly adopted a back three for the 2014 World Cup, was notably determined to insist that the evolution to a back three was inherent in the post-Cruyffian football he had practised at Ajax and Barcelona. But the truth is that very few managers are idealists. They may have complicated personal moral codes \u2013 Wolves\u2019 Stan Cullis, for instance. In his final match as a player, the centre-half refused to pull down Albert Stubbins on the last day of the season, allowing him to score the goal that gave Liverpool the 1946-47 title at the expense of his side. Yet seven years later, as manager, he was happy enough to water an already soaked pitch so that Honved\u2019s passing game foundered in the mud; doctoring the pitch was fine, but a deliberate foul was beyond the line. There aren\u2019t many, though, who would eschew a particular style that they thought might be successful. In football \u201cpragmatic\u201d tends to be a synonym for defensive or direct, but the truth is the vast majority of managers are pragmatists; they play how they play because they believe that is what offers them the best chance of success. Guardiola is constantly refining what that means; 15 years on from the tiki\u2011taka of his first Champions League win, he is playing with a classic No 9 and has experimented with a back four comprising only central defenders. Martin may or may not be correct about the best way for Southampton to play but the notion he is pursuing some self-defeating higher goal rather than simply trying to win games is fanciful, and the idea he is trying to parlay his season in the sun into a glamorous job abroad having seen Vincent Kompany land the Bayern Munich job after relegation with Burnley absurd.

Netanyahu will have to do better than that. This case is not remotely about antisemitism. It\u2019s not about Israel\u2019s right to defend itself, which nobody disputes.

Freedom of information (FoI) documents show the Advisory Committee on Medicines (ACM) met in April to consider changing the prescribing requirements for the drug, sodium valproate, after the UK introduced tougher regulations in January. Of babies exposed to valproate during pregnancy, about 10% were born with birth defects and up to 40% were at risk of permanent developmental disorders, UK and Australian therapeutic guidelines state. Sophie Gardner, who runs an online support group for Australian families affected by foetal valproate syndrome, says many were not aware of the risks from the medication until after their children were born. The mother of two feels \u201cAustralia\u2019s just so far behind\u201d countries such as the UK. \u201cThere are court cases happening around the world, compensation schemes have been proposed \u2026 Australia just seems to have its head in the sand when it comes to this drug.\u201d Gardner, who lives in Victoria, took valproate to treat her epilepsy during both her pregnancies and says she was not sufficiently informed about the possibility her medication could cause birth defects. \u201cThe concern was more about my actual epilepsy,\u201d a brain disorder that causes recurring, unprovoked seizures.

But when she discovered mothers in the UK raising awareness of foetal valproate syndrome, it cemented her fears the drug may have affected her children. A doctor advised her that sodium valproate might be one factor affecting both boys\u2019 development. Gardner says a board of paediatricians, including neurologists, who then assessed clinical information about her sons confirmed both had been exposed to and affected by the drug. To reduce risks for pregnant women, the UK now requires review and signoff from two medical specialists before prescribing valproate to anyone aged under 55, along with other safety measures. Australia\u2019s drugs regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), asked the ACM for advice on whether similar changes should be made, FoI documents showed, noting the high quality of the UK\u2019s evidence and guidance. The documents noted that the TGA had reported 109 cases of pregnant Australian women exposed to sodium valproate since 2004. Sixty of those cases occurred since 2018, when the TGA requested more stringent pregnancy warning pictures and alerts for health professionals on sodium valproate products. It caveated that there was the possibility of duplicates in some of the total case numbers. After considering the evidence, the ACM determined that current Australian prescribing measures, which include counselling for women of childbearing age and warning labels, were sufficient. The ACM cited several reasons for its stance, including concerns about the \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on doctors if they were required to get a second specialist to sign off. The ACM noted uncertainty about how additional restrictions would affect prescribing practices in Australia, and that gender-based prescribing restrictions had been previously ruled out because of concerns about administrative complexity and equality of access, the documents showed. But one pharmacy expert and advocates for prescribing changes questioned the ACM\u2019s recommendation, concerned that existing measures do little to address gaps in the safeguarding of women and their pregnancy. Prof Barbara Mintzes, a specialist in pharmaceutical policy at the University of Sydney, does not believe gender equity concerns about access to medication should trump \u201can overriding desire not to have exposures in pregnancy for a drug that\u2019s risky for use\u201d. \u201cSometimes you need to take stronger action, because you already have evidence that what has been done before has not completely prevented exposure,\u201d she says. One measure she wants considered in Australia is \u201cwritten informed consent\u201d from patients, similar to the risk acknowledgment form required in the UK.

Sanofi\u2019s valproate guidelines emphasise that people should not stop taking the medication without consulting their doctor; NHS guidelines stress the same advice. Carol Ireland, the CEO of Epilepsy Action Australia, is also concerned that if similar restrictions to those imposed in the UK are introduced in Australia, many people with epilepsy would find it harder to access highly effective medication. \u201cClinical practices have evolved, with a marked reduction in the average daily dose of valproate prescribed to pregnant women, contributing to a decline in the rate of foetal malformations,\u201d Ireland says. But Mintzes is concerned the data in the FoI documents doesn\u2019t show the extent of the exposure during pregnancy in Australia. \u201cThere is an overall general problem globally of adverse event reports from exposures to drugs being subject to under reporting,\u201d she says. A spokesperson for the TGA says it has robust processes for ongoing monitoring of the safety of all medicines on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). They noted that \u201cevery brand of sodium valproate in Australia now contains a pictogram and written warning regarding the known risks of use in pregnancy on the outer packaging\u201d, but also acknowledged \u201cthe importance of the informed consent process\u201d during prescribing. \u201cIn recent years, the issue of the use of sodium valproate in pregnancy and people of child-bearing potential has been reviewed by the TGA in 2014, 2018 and 2024,\u201d the spokesperson says. \u201cThe advice provided by the ACM has been used to guide the TGA\u2019s investigation, which is ongoing.\u201d Do you know more?

      "bodyText": "As more than a hundred climate activists waded into the Port of Newcastle on Thursday afternoon with kayaks and rafts, with police boats drifting in the distance, it was unclear what would happen next. In a supreme court room, about two and half hours\u2019 drive south in Sydney, sat 21-year-old Alexa Stuart who was challenging a maritime exclusion zone the New South Wales government had imposed around the port. The zone restricted anyone entering the water over a four-day period in a bid to stop the protest, which was attempting to stop coal ships from leaving the port. A few hours later, the court would accept the argument of the protest organisers, Rising Tide, that the government had improperly used the Marine Safety Act and deemed the move invalid. When news of the win spread to the protesters floating on the water, the crowd erupted in a rousing cheer, waving paddles in the air. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cWe\u2019ve had to overcome so many twists and turns,\u201d Stuart says. \u201cThe fact we are here is a win in itself.\u201d Legal experts say moves by the government and police to stop the Rising Tide protest \u2013 which organisers hoped to be among the biggest climate protests in Australia\u2019s history \u2013 comes amid an escalating crackdown on protesting across the country. \u2018Draconian anti-protest laws weaken our democracy\u2019 Over the past two decades there have been 49 laws introduced by federal and state governments that have eroded rights to protest, according to a report released by the Human Rights Law Centre in June. The report author, senior lawyer David Mejia-Canales, says that since the report\u2019s release, protests have been \u201crestricted in significant ways\u201d across both pro-Palestine and climate movements. \u201cIt\u2019s being done by police and politicians,\u201d Mejia-Canales says. \u201cThe reasons are being wrapped up in often dubious safety concerns,\u201d Mejia-Canales adds, referring to the NSW police\u2019s supreme court challenge against a pro-Palestine protest which cited new planter boxes installed at town hall as one of a number of safety hazards. Mejia-Canales\u2019s report found NSW had introduced the most anti-protest laws. On Thursday, the Minns government added another, introducing a maximum $22,000 offence for obstructing a railway. It adds to the same laws for protesters caught blocking major roads and facilities like ports \u2013 parts of which the supreme court found last year were unconstitutional. \u201cRecent protests have centred on railway lines, putting everyone\u2019s safety at risk,\u201d Minns said at the time of the announcement. \u201cIntroducing this fine for blocking a railway line sends a strong message: this conduct is not acceptable.\u201d Five unions, including the NSW Nurses and Midwives Association, signed a letter opposing the bill. In a statement to Guardian Australia, the Australian Services Union says the government \u201chad decided to double down on bad legislation even after the supreme court ruled part of the laws unconstitutional\u201d. \u201cDraconian anti-protest laws, together with the lack of a basic Human Rights Act in NSW, weakens our democracy,\u201d the union\u2019s secretary, Angus McFarland, says. Mejia-Canales says these laws are also causing protests to become more restricted by police via the form 1 permit system for protests. If organisers\u2019 applications are accepted by the police, it protects them from certain criminal charges, such as obstructing traffic. But Mejia-Canales says the threat of charges under the anti-protest laws has transformed the form 1 system, from what used to be a notification to police, to making police the \u201cauthoriser\u201d of protests. This permit system does not exist in Victoria, where the premier, Jacinta Allan, rejected a proposal to introduce one. For this reason, Mejia-Canales says \u201cVictoria is above other places\u201d in how the right to protest is protected. In the space of a month, the NSW police declined and legally challenged two applications to hold a protest. This included a rally which went ahead after negotiations between organisers and police. The second legal challenge, which it ultimately won, was against the Rising Tide organisers, who had made an application to block coal exports from leaving the port for 30 hours. A similar protest had gone ahead last year. But this time around, the police minister, Yasmin Catley, said police deemed it \u201ctoo big and dangerous to proceed\u201d. \u201cWe strongly urge the public not to attend or participate in this assembly. Do not put yourself or our police, maritime, and emergency service workers at risk,\u201d Catley said. The Rising Tide protest went ahead, with organisers expecting 5,500 demonstrators over a week-long action. On Saturday, three were arrested after they tried to paddle through a police water checkpoint. \u2018We are really up against it\u2019 This increasingly stringent approach is happening as Australia pitched itself to the world as the right location for the 2026 UN climate summit \u2013 COP31. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely worried about how these trends may escalate in the lead up to COP,\u201d says Isabelle Reinecke, the founder of Grata Fund, a public interest organisation that helps individuals access the courts. \u201cCOP will be a really important opportunity for Australians to express their concerns, and people from other communities in the region, like Pacific Island leaders and their communities, to express their concerns with the Australian government\u2019s approach.\u201d Australia is the third largest exporter of fossil fuels in the world. Since the Albanese government was elected, the Greens say it has approved 26 new coal and gas projects. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has said the country is aiming to become a \u201crenewable energy superpower\u201d, but that it was a big task that would take time. Rising Tide is demanding the government immediately cancel all new fossil fuel projects and end all coal exports from Newcastle by 2030. It is also calling for the government to tax current fossil fuel export profits at 78%, and to put that money towards community and industrial transition away from fossil fuels. At the protest this week \u2013 it began on Tuesday and will run until Monday \u2013 it felt more party than protest at times. It attracted people from across the country, and included a land-based \u201cprotestival\u201d with a number of musical performances, including one by Midnight Oil frontman, Peter Garrett. \u201cThe overreach from the authorities including the NSW government in respect of peaceful protest is unnecessary,\u201d Garrett told the crowd after his performance. The water-based aspect of the protest, the purpose of which was to block coal ships, did not work however. The coal and other cargo ships continued to lumber through the port. Police set up an area in the water, marked by yellow bouys, and reportedly told organisers it had been set up for people\u2019s safety and moving past them would result in a response by the police, but not an immediate arrest. \u201cIt was like they had set up a kiddie pool for us, while they [let] the coal ships through,\u201d says Stuart, who led the legal actions against the government\u2019s exclusion zone. On Saturday, the third day of the protest, activists decided to test this, paddling outside the boundary set by police, resulting in three arrests Stuart says the reason protesters felt compelled to engage in civil disobedience was to \u201csend a message\u201d.

NT police spent 882,000 hours on domestic violence in 2022-23. Based on those figures, Dwyer said, the projected costs of police response to domestic violence by 2026 would be a minimum of $156m a year.</p> <p>Murphy said NT police faced challenges in recruitment and retention, there were concerns about racism within the force and there was a significant number of officers on long-term sick leave.</p> <p>Under questioning by Phillip Boulten SC representing one of the women\u2019s families, Murphy revealed that an NT police sergeant shared a photo of a topless Aboriginal woman with a WhatsApp group of other officers in Alice Springs.

These four women\u2019s shortened lives and brutal deaths are part of a landmark coronial inquest which began in July 2023 and concludes on Monday, when the Northern Territory coroner, Elisabeth Armitage, is due to hand down her findings. Armitage combined the deaths of Kumanjayi Haywood, Ngeygo Ragurrk, Miss Yunupingu and Kumarn Rubuntja to examine systemic failings across the domestic, sexual and family violence sector. All four women had reported to authorities or loved ones their fears for their safety in the weeks, months and even years before they were killed. All four perpetrators had histories of family violence and were known to police. The inquest has heard shocking testimony about an \u201cepidemic\u201d of violence against Aboriginal women, which the coroner has called a \u201cterrible, terrible carnage\u201d. \u201cThis is not somebody else\u2019s horror. This is our horror,\u201d Armitage said in court in October 2023. Armitage\u2019s investigations have found 81 women have died as a result of domestic violence in the NT since 2000. 93% of them were Aboriginal. The NT has the worst domestic and family violence rates in the nation. Its domestic homicide rate is seven times the national rate. Aboriginal women in the NT are 40 times more likely to be hospitalised for domestic violence. And these statistics are growing worse. The NT police commissioner, Michael Murphy, told the inquest in May there has been a 117% increase in domestic and family violence over the past 10 years, and police expected it to rise by a further 73% over the next decade. Counsel assisting the coroner, Peggy Dwyer SC, told the court that 50% to 80% of NT police\u2019s entire workload was spent on domestic and family violence matters. NT police spent 882,000 hours on domestic violence in 2022-23. Based on those figures, Dwyer said, the projected costs of police response to domestic violence by 2026 would be a minimum of $156m a year. Murphy said NT police faced challenges in recruitment and retention, there were concerns about racism within the force and there was a significant number of officers on long-term sick leave. Under questioning by Phillip Boulten SC representing one of the women\u2019s families, Murphy revealed that an NT police sergeant shared a photo of a topless Aboriginal woman with a WhatsApp group of other officers in Alice Springs. The woman had been unconscious in a public place when the photo was taken, the court heard. A member of the group reported it to the professional standards command, and an internal inquiry recommended the officer be demoted from sergeant and transferred. But Murphy told the court he rescinded that decision after the officer admitted to the act and had shown contrition. Instead, Murphy said, the officer was transferred to Darwin and given a 12-month good behaviour bond, but not demoted. The inquest heard evidence of \u201cchronic and shocking\u201d underfunding, and services struggling to meet demand. In August 2023, the court was told the NT government had rejected calls for $180m to be spent over five years for women\u2019s shelters, behaviour change programs and policy reform. It had provided the sector with $20m over two years. The NT government director of strategic policy in the domestic, family and sexual violence reduction division, Anna Davis, told the court in May this year the territory needed \u201csustainable needs-based funding\u201d from the commonwealth. Due to its small population, the inquest heard, the NT receives just 4.6% of federal funding under the national partnership agreement on family and domestic violence. In August, Dwyer put 30 recommendations to the coroner that she said should be addressed, including increased and indexed funding for family violence services, an overhaul of prison and men\u2019s behaviour-change programs, culturally appropriate supports including interpreters and the establishment of an NT peak body for domestic and family violence. On Friday, the NT\u2019s peak Aboriginal health body, Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance Northern Territory (Amsant), called on the NT government to fulfil its $180m election commitment to tackling the crisis. Amsant\u2019 \u2018s CEO, Dr John Paterson, said the new CLP government needed to move \u201cbeyond lip service\u201d. \u201cBefore the election, both major parties recognised the desperate need and committed to $180m over five years to support specialist services. Yet, since taking office, the CLP government has provided no details on how this critical funding will be delivered,\u201d Paterson said. This month, the eighth alleged domestic violence-related homicide since June was recorded in Katherine, Paterson said. \u201cThis is a crisis that has already cost far too many lives, particularly the lives of our Aboriginal women \u2013 and the reality is that these deaths, these traumas, are preventable,\u201d he said. \u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14 and the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123 and the domestic abuse helpline is 0808 2000 247. In the US, the suicide prevention lifeline is 988 and the domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233). Other international helplines can be found via www.befrienders.org",

      "bodyText": "Twelve months on from Canada\u2019s worst-ever wildfire season unfolding during a news blackout on Facebook, the nation has warned Australia about Meta\u2019s \u201creckless\u201d behaviour during \u201cneed-to-know situations\u201d. An early start to Australia\u2019s bushfire season is looming for swaths of the country, with large parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory, the south-west of Victoria and south-east corner of South Australia facing higher risk, according to an official assessment in September. In August 2023, negotiations between the tech giant and Canada\u2019s government broke down as Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals doggedly pursued news bargaining deal C-18, known as the Online News Act \u2013 similar to the one struck in Australia in 2021 following a seven-day news blackout. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The breakdown in negotiations resulted in Meta blocking all news sources on Facebook in Canada \u201crecklessly and dangerously\u201d as all 10 provinces and three territories in the country burned, Canada\u2019s heritage minister, Pascale St-Onge, told Guardian Australia. \u201cFacebook is leaving disinformation and misinformation to spread on their platform, while choosing to block access to reliable, high-quality, independent journalism,\u201d St-Onge said. \u201cFacebook is just leaving more room for misinformation during need-to-know situations like wildfires, emergencies, local elections and other critical times for people to make decisions on matters that affect them.\u201d Misleading clickbait became prevalent as an area of 15m hectares \u2013 larger than England and 2.5 times the second-most destructive wildfire season in 1989 \u2013 burned across Canada, killing eight people and displacing hundreds of thousands. A spokesperson for St-Onge said Facebook had \u201ccontinued to block news recklessly and dangerously\u201d as the nation entered into another wildfire season in June of this year. \u201cCanadians now can\u2019t access or share vital information on social media at times when affected Canadians are checking in on loved ones and others are possibly evacuating,\u201d the spokesperson said. The Australian government is negotiating with Meta after it declined to renew deals made under the news media bargaining code to compensate news publishers for news carried on Facebook and Instagram. The government may choose to designate Meta (force it into negotiations over compensation or face fines) which could prompt Meta to ban news altogether. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said the government was considering advice about the code and would \u201chave more to say in due course\u201d. \u201cFrom local news and current affairs to vital emergency information, a significant and growing number of Australians use social media platforms to access news,\u201d she said. \u201cAustralians should have access to quality sources of information online, including trusted news brands. This is especially important during natural emergencies.\u201d In June this year, Meta told a parliamentary inquiry into social media \u201call options are on the table\u201d when asked if it would pull all news from Facebook if it it was designated. The parliamentary committee recommended in its second interim report the government should consider imposing a \u201cdigital platform levy\u201d \u2013 a kind of big tech tax - on companies such as Meta and Google. News content on Facebook in Australia has already become far less prominent, and Facebook removed its unsuccessful news tab. Anthony Albanese has also raised the possibility of a levy, with the prime minister saying the social media companies shouldn\u2019t get a \u201cfree ride\u201d. In early October, in response to questions on notice from the social media inquiry, Meta said only 3% of Facebook views were of news links, arguing that showed \u201caccess to news content is not the core reason people use Facebook\u201d and that people could access news elsewhere. It also argued it combated misinformation with factcheckers, safeguards and measures to reduce its spread and availability, and removed disinformation and harmful misinformation. A spokesperson for Meta said there was \u201cno change\u201d to publishers\u2019 ability to use Facebook, and no change to its Safety Check product, which allows users to let others know they are safe in a time of crisis. Other features include \u201caccess to authoritative information, including content from official government agencies, emergency services and non-governmental organisations\u201d, the spokesperson said. Meta has also agreed to \u201chelp amplify official information for people in emergency situations like wildfires\u201d and coordinate with the government to spread reputable information. Prof Dan Angus, director of Queensland University of Technology\u2019s Digital Media Research Centre, said Meta slowly deprioritising news might be undetectable to the average user. \u201cWe\u2019re creatures of habit \u2026 if all of a sudden tomorrow those platforms upend their algorithms and what content is featured, people might not necessarily know they need to change something because they\u2019re not getting news in their feed any more,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>It was January 2003 and I was about to start my studies at the University of Johannesburg \u2013 and had officially sworn off relationships. I\u2019d had two serious relationships in high school, both with older boys, where I felt I needed to change who I was in order to be with them. I was done trying to please others and saw university as my fresh start to be truly me.</p> <p>The university had a start-of-the-year tradition \u2013 the campus residences would create and parade their floats for charity. My group was tasked with folding blommetjies vou (polystyrene-filled cellophane flowers) for our float, which was based on the Lord of the Rings movie.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His friend turned to me and angrily hissed: \u2018You know he\u2019s dating someone else, right?\u2019 My heart fell through the floor</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was drawn to Rico, who was in my group, and his friendly, sparkly blue eyes. We were worlds apart \u2013 I was from an English background in a female residence; he was Afrikaans and in a male day house. But we had so much in common: a love of cartoon movies; being head students and studying Stem subjects (engineering for him, mathematics for me); and the pressures that came with the latter two. Over those next few days, as we talked and folded flowers, I felt Rico was someone who was not only on my level intellectually and emotionally, but also valued my feelings and strengths.</p> <p>I remember feeling disappointed one night when he asked every one of my friends to dance. But by the end of the evening he came over and said he\u2019d saved the best for last, and we spent the last few songs in each other\u2019s arms.</p> <p>One day, I was folding flowers with Rico and one of his \u201cfriends\u201d. I could feel tension but didn\u2019t think too much about it. When Rico stood up to fetch more staples, his friend turned to me and angrily hissed: \u201cYou know he\u2019s dating someone else, right?\u201d My heart fell through the floor.</p> <p>When he came back, I was too devastated to say anything. He kept asking what was wrong but every time I looked up, his friend would glare at me, so I said nothing. He asked to speak to his friend outside and they walked off. I suddenly started sobbing because it hit me \u2013 I\u2019d fallen for him, hard.</p>    <p>Over the next few days, I refused to speak to him. I was too scared of my feelings, I didn\u2019t want a relationship, and I thought if I avoided him, my feelings would disappear. But thankfully he was more stubborn than me.</p> <p>I left to work on a different area of the float and he convinced the seniors to allow him to carry a huge wire Gollum across campus just so he could talk to me. He explained how his previous relationship had finished before we met, and that friend was upset and wanting to cause trouble. I made him swear that no matter what happened, he would never lie to me. We spoke for hours after that and had our first kiss.</p> <p>On float day, where first years parade alongside the floats, we walked together, holding hands. As we rounded a corner some senior students started throwing water balloons at us first years. There was nowhere to hide, and as a huge balloon came hurtling straight towards me, Rico jumped in front of it \u2013 and was drenched. The balloons kept coming, but he kept taking them.

      "bodyText": "It was January 2003 and I was about to start my studies at the University of Johannesburg \u2013 and had officially sworn off relationships. I\u2019d had two serious relationships in high school, both with older boys, where I felt I needed to change who I was in order to be with them. I was done trying to please others and saw university as my fresh start to be truly me. The university had a start-of-the-year tradition \u2013 the campus residences would create and parade their floats for charity. My group was tasked with folding blommetjies vou (polystyrene-filled cellophane flowers) for our float, which was based on the Lord of the Rings movie. I was drawn to Rico, who was in my group, and his friendly, sparkly blue eyes. We were worlds apart \u2013 I was from an English background in a female residence; he was Afrikaans and in a male day house. But we had so much in common: a love of cartoon movies; being head students and studying Stem subjects (engineering for him, mathematics for me); and the pressures that came with the latter two. Over those next few days, as we talked and folded flowers, I felt Rico was someone who was not only on my level intellectually and emotionally, but also valued my feelings and strengths. I remember feeling disappointed one night when he asked every one of my friends to dance. But by the end of the evening he came over and said he\u2019d saved the best for last, and we spent the last few songs in each other\u2019s arms. One day, I was folding flowers with Rico and one of his \u201cfriends\u201d. I could feel tension but didn\u2019t think too much about it. When Rico stood up to fetch more staples, his friend turned to me and angrily hissed: \u201cYou know he\u2019s dating someone else, right?\u201d My heart fell through the floor. When he came back, I was too devastated to say anything. He kept asking what was wrong but every time I looked up, his friend would glare at me, so I said nothing. He asked to speak to his friend outside and they walked off. I suddenly started sobbing because it hit me \u2013 I\u2019d fallen for him, hard. Over the next few days, I refused to speak to him. I was too scared of my feelings, I didn\u2019t want a relationship, and I thought if I avoided him, my feelings would disappear. But thankfully he was more stubborn than me. I left to work on a different area of the float and he convinced the seniors to allow him to carry a huge wire Gollum across campus just so he could talk to me. He explained how his previous relationship had finished before we met, and that friend was upset and wanting to cause trouble. I made him swear that no matter what happened, he would never lie to me. We spoke for hours after that and had our first kiss. On float day, where first years parade alongside the floats, we walked together, holding hands. As we rounded a corner some senior students started throwing water balloons at us first years. There was nowhere to hide, and as a huge balloon came hurtling straight towards me, Rico jumped in front of it \u2013 and was drenched. The balloons kept coming, but he kept taking them. For the first time in my life, someone was willing to stand up for me. He proposed four years later, after a day of waterfall abseiling, in the middle of the Drakensberg mountains \u2013 he\u2019d chartered a helicopter to fly us there. We had a small wedding later that year; our first dance was to I\u2019m a Believer by Smash Mouth. We now have five amazing kids and homeschool them together on our just-built four-hectare property in the south of New Zealand.

He\u2019s shown me how to open my heart to others \u2013 while saving me from water balloons along the way.",

      "body": "<p>In my day, the Wiggles were a tame bunch. Four blokes in loose skivvies whose concerts more closely resembled a school nativity play<em> </em>than a sold-out Eras show.</p> <p>When I saw them in Toowoomba in 1997, was I thrust into an early puberty by their moves? Hardly. In fact, when all four signed my Dorothy the Dinosaur T-shirt, even at the age of four I thought, clingy much?</p> <p>They were firmly G-rated, lo-fi and family friendly. And, crucially, daggy. Shamelessly daggy \u2013 the metric that turns kids into consumers.</p> <p>And consume they did. The Wiggles<em> </em>accrued serious capital. But it\u2019s easy to imagine a Don Draper-style marketing consultant whispering in their ears: \u201cWe\u2019ve got the kids. Now how do we get the adults?\u201d</p> <p>Twenty-five years later, and with my signed T-shirt lost to the Lifeline bin, the Wiggles have cracked the code. Long gone are concerts and shows leaning exclusively on nursery rhymes and the cutesy theatrics of Dorothy the Dinosaur, Wags the Dog and Henry the Octopus. Instead, the Wiggles are harnessing raw emotion. Vibe, even.</p> <p>Enter the Tree of Wisdom. The man. The $2 wig. The leaves hardly held on with a single stitch. The Tarocash chinos. And those moves.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb2aAtapOQk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fb2aAtapOQk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>He works it better than Missy Elliott. Puts his thing down, flips it and reverses it. Drops it like it\u2019s hot. He seems to have found what the French would call his raison d\u2019etre by thrusting what my toddler would call \u201chis bum bum\u201d. Move over \u201chot Purple Wiggle\u201d John Pearce (but don\u2019t go far).</p> <p>As a mother of a toddler and newborn, the Instagram algorithm makes sure my feed is tightly maintained \u2013 sleep consultants, baby-led weaning recipes, and Brian Jordan Alvarez\u2019s shirtless dance videos. But this week fan videos of the Tree of Wisdom <strong> </strong>seeped into my timeline. I couldn\u2019t pry my bloodshot eyes away. I fell in love with him. He made this bone-tired mum grin ear to ear. \u201cI\u2019ve got some dance moves for you,\u201d the tree sings, and I know he\u2019s speaking just to me.</p> <p>Don\u2019t ask how I know, but in 2015 Dominic Field (the Tree\u2019s human name) posted on Instagram that his childhood hero was Captain Feathersword. In a trajectory positively Sophoclean, Field would end up playing Feathersword while touring with the Wiggles. He\u2019d also fill in for sick Wiggles, including his uncle who just happens to sport the blue skivvy. Not only is the nepo-tree a delight to watch; he has wholesome roots.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Daniel field instagram\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

      "bodyText": "In my day, the Wiggles were a tame bunch. Four blokes in loose skivvies whose concerts more closely resembled a school nativity play than a sold-out Eras show. When I saw them in Toowoomba in 1997, was I thrust into an early puberty by their moves? Hardly. In fact, when all four signed my Dorothy the Dinosaur T-shirt, even at the age of four I thought, clingy much? They were firmly G-rated, lo-fi and family friendly. And, crucially, daggy. Shamelessly daggy \u2013 the metric that turns kids into consumers. And consume they did. The Wiggles accrued serious capital. But it\u2019s easy to imagine a Don Draper-style marketing consultant whispering in their ears: \u201cWe\u2019ve got the kids. Now how do we get the adults?\u201d Twenty-five years later, and with my signed T-shirt lost to the Lifeline bin, the Wiggles have cracked the code. Long gone are concerts and shows leaning exclusively on nursery rhymes and the cutesy theatrics of Dorothy the Dinosaur, Wags the Dog and Henry the Octopus. Instead, the Wiggles are harnessing raw emotion. Vibe, even. Enter the Tree of Wisdom. The man. The $2 wig. The leaves hardly held on with a single stitch. The Tarocash chinos. And those moves. He works it better than Missy Elliott. Puts his thing down, flips it and reverses it. Drops it like it\u2019s hot. He seems to have found what the French would call his raison d\u2019etre by thrusting what my toddler would call \u201chis bum bum\u201d. Move over \u201chot Purple Wiggle\u201d John Pearce (but don\u2019t go far). As a mother of a toddler and newborn, the Instagram algorithm makes sure my feed is tightly maintained \u2013 sleep consultants, baby-led weaning recipes, and Brian Jordan Alvarez\u2019s shirtless dance videos. But this week fan videos of the Tree of Wisdom seeped into my timeline. I couldn\u2019t pry my bloodshot eyes away. I fell in love with him. He made this bone-tired mum grin ear to ear. \u201cI\u2019ve got some dance moves for you,\u201d the tree sings, and I know he\u2019s speaking just to me. Don\u2019t ask how I know, but in 2015 Dominic Field (the Tree\u2019s human name) posted on Instagram that his childhood hero was Captain Feathersword. In a trajectory positively Sophoclean, Field would end up playing Feathersword while touring with the Wiggles. He\u2019d also fill in for sick Wiggles, including his uncle who just happens to sport the blue skivvy. Not only is the nepo-tree a delight to watch; he has wholesome roots. And now he\u2019s a viral sensation. One video of Field\u2019s performance has attracted 5.2m views on Instagram and 9.4m on TikTok. Now, I don\u2019t have access to the analytics, but I think I know the demographic bringing in those views. These numbers, this cultural phenomenon, shouldn\u2019t be dismissed. Dancers have gone to the Olympics with less. There is likely an Aria in Dominic\u2019s future, maybe even a talkshow. Give this sapling a permanent spot on the crew and let him grow! It would be cynical to wholly attribute the Tree of Wisdom\u2019s inclusion in the Wiggles as part of the \u201cnew deal\u201d of kids\u2019 entertainment \u2013 something for you, something for them \u2013 perhaps best embodied by Bluey; my daughter likes that they are talking dogs, I like that Chilli is regularly at breaking point.

But even if we\u2019ve never met them, sportspeople can still move us, repel us, shock us, teach us. And when they die too young, we can mourn them.</p> <p>Hughes\u2019s death certainly stirred the public in ways we\u2019d never before seen. There was a restraint, a dignity, a decency that was at odds with the social media that instigated it. It was a reminder that sport is ultimately a shared experience, and that not all such actions are conjured up by sponsors, administrators or broadcasters.</p>    <p>And it was a reminder of something else \u2013 something that cricket, with its quirks and its village traditions and its rough democracy \u2013 does better than most sports. It\u2019s the understanding that everyone, from the most inept suburban trundler to the solar fame and talent of Virat Kohli, is playing the same game, respecting the same history, subject to the same laws and facing the same dangers. Cricketers, whether at Christmas lunch or at Lord\u2019s, take guard and assess their options. Cricketers raise their bat, curse their luck and shadow stroke the shot they should have played. And cricketers always go home.</p> <p>The fondness of memory and the depth of loss no doubt speaks to the kind of cricketer Hughes was. For so long in Australia, cricket was about paying your dues, waiting in line and seizing your chance. Hughes\u2019s career was almost the inverse of that. He burst into Test cricket in a blaze of light. We\u2019d grown up watching stubby openers scratch around. But Hughes was unlike any of them. He was so loose, so unorthodox, so utterly undaunted by the crack South African bowling line-up. Wearing a black armband to honour Victoria\u2019s bushfire victims, he brought up his maiden ton with consecutive sixes.</p> <p>We all have our memories of him, but I vividly recall the first ball he faced against Pakistan in the Sydney Test a year later. Mohammad Sami shuffled in and Hughes tried to hit him into Kippax Lake. He faced 10 balls and didn\u2019t make a run, but I loved him all the more for it.</p> <p>Anyone who has lost a loved one far too young is tortured by the same thoughts. What would they be like now? What would they look like? What sort of adult would they have grown to be? They hit you in moments of joy and in the mundanity of everyday life. You welcome a newborn but there is an absence, an aching loss. You see a woman on the train who would be the same age, the same hair colour. You do the arithmetic, and stare a little longer than you should.</p>    <p>With sportspeople, particularly on days like today, those questions nag away too. How would Hughes have adapted and improved his game? Would he have been a calming, sensible voice in the sandpaper Test? How would he have handled Jasprit Bumrah on the weekend? In his eulogy, Michael Clarke said he kept looking for him, kept expecting him to pop up, to saunter in, to lighten the mood. Occasionally, though increasingly rarely, I see a cricketer who reminds me of Hughes. They\u2019re usually young, invariably from the country, usually before the rough edges have been knocked off their game. Sometimes, I listen to an AFL draftee from the country and I hear Hughes\u2019s voice \u2013 that dry, bony, completely unaffected accent we heard at his funeral.</p> <p>At the funeral there was a single bat, a Kookaburra, leaning against a coffin. The pews were filled with prime ministers, Indian superstars and local cattle farmers. For loved ones and for those who didn\u2019t know him, the communion, the eulogies, the tributes, the conga lines of bats around the world \u2013 it was all a comfort.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/22/phillip-hughes-death-anniversary-cricket-australia\">Cricket ready to honour Phillip Hughes on 10-year anniversary of tragic death</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Time heals, they tell you. And they are right to a point. But grief, Joan Didion wrote, \u201ccomes in waves, paroxysms, sudden apprehensions that weaken the knees and blind the eyes and obliterate the dailiness of life\u201d. Sport helps. Sport is sometimes a way of connecting and deflecting and finding meaning when the real things are too hard to talk about, too hard to countenance. I once saw it referred to as \u201cthe great avoidance\u201d. In sports like cricket, there can be solace in numbers, in dates, in averages. But while Hughes\u2019s numbers bring some sort of clarity, they offer no comfort. He was 63 not out. It has been 10 years. He would have been 36 this Saturday.</p> <p>I once saw an interview with a footballer whose daughter had died of a brain tumour. \u201cDid he feel cheated?\u201d the journalist asked. The footballer, the father, was flattened by that question. Of course, he eventually said. But <em>she</em> was the one who\u2019d been cheated.</p> <p>Those who loved Phillip Hughes spoke of the things he would now never get to do \u2013 regaining his Test spot, realising his talent, becoming a parent, retiring to breed Angus cattle. He was robbed of all that. It was a life celebrated and a life that will never be forgotten. But it was a life robbed nonetheless. I\u2019ll say it again \u2013 he would have been 36 this Saturday. Nothing we do as fans and nothing we write as journalists can properly meet the crushing desolation of that.</p>",

A child is struck by a car crashing into a playground. A family is blown to bits by a missile. A young girl is murdered and dumped in a tip. A cricketer is killed at the crease. The people who sneer at sport \u2013 and sometimes it deserves to be sneered at \u2013 say our response to these tragedies is excessive, provincial, almost embarrassing. But even if we\u2019ve never met them, sportspeople can still move us, repel us, shock us, teach us. And when they die too young, we can mourn them. Hughes\u2019s death certainly stirred the public in ways we\u2019d never before seen. There was a restraint, a dignity, a decency that was at odds with the social media that instigated it. It was a reminder that sport is ultimately a shared experience, and that not all such actions are conjured up by sponsors, administrators or broadcasters. And it was a reminder of something else \u2013 something that cricket, with its quirks and its village traditions and its rough democracy \u2013 does better than most sports. It\u2019s the understanding that everyone, from the most inept suburban trundler to the solar fame and talent of Virat Kohli, is playing the same game, respecting the same history, subject to the same laws and facing the same dangers. Cricketers, whether at Christmas lunch or at Lord\u2019s, take guard and assess their options. Cricketers raise their bat, curse their luck and shadow stroke the shot they should have played. And cricketers always go home. The fondness of memory and the depth of loss no doubt speaks to the kind of cricketer Hughes was. For so long in Australia, cricket was about paying your dues, waiting in line and seizing your chance. Hughes\u2019s career was almost the inverse of that. He burst into Test cricket in a blaze of light. We\u2019d grown up watching stubby openers scratch around. But Hughes was unlike any of them. He was so loose, so unorthodox, so utterly undaunted by the crack South African bowling line-up. Wearing a black armband to honour Victoria\u2019s bushfire victims, he brought up his maiden ton with consecutive sixes. We all have our memories of him, but I vividly recall the first ball he faced against Pakistan in the Sydney Test a year later. Mohammad Sami shuffled in and Hughes tried to hit him into Kippax Lake. He faced 10 balls and didn\u2019t make a run, but I loved him all the more for it. Anyone who has lost a loved one far too young is tortured by the same thoughts. What would they be like now? What would they look like? What sort of adult would they have grown to be? They hit you in moments of joy and in the mundanity of everyday life. You welcome a newborn but there is an absence, an aching loss. You see a woman on the train who would be the same age, the same hair colour. You do the arithmetic, and stare a little longer than you should. With sportspeople, particularly on days like today, those questions nag away too. How would Hughes have adapted and improved his game? Would he have been a calming, sensible voice in the sandpaper Test? How would he have handled Jasprit Bumrah on the weekend? In his eulogy, Michael Clarke said he kept looking for him, kept expecting him to pop up, to saunter in, to lighten the mood. Occasionally, though increasingly rarely, I see a cricketer who reminds me of Hughes. They\u2019re usually young, invariably from the country, usually before the rough edges have been knocked off their game. Sometimes, I listen to an AFL draftee from the country and I hear Hughes\u2019s voice \u2013 that dry, bony, completely unaffected accent we heard at his funeral. At the funeral there was a single bat, a Kookaburra, leaning against a coffin. The pews were filled with prime ministers, Indian superstars and local cattle farmers. For loved ones and for those who didn\u2019t know him, the communion, the eulogies, the tributes, the conga lines of bats around the world \u2013 it was all a comfort. Time heals, they tell you. And they are right to a point. But grief, Joan Didion wrote, \u201ccomes in waves, paroxysms, sudden apprehensions that weaken the knees and blind the eyes and obliterate the dailiness of life\u201d. Sport helps. Sport is sometimes a way of connecting and deflecting and finding meaning when the real things are too hard to talk about, too hard to countenance. I once saw it referred to as \u201cthe great avoidance\u201d. In sports like cricket, there can be solace in numbers, in dates, in averages. But while Hughes\u2019s numbers bring some sort of clarity, they offer no comfort. He was 63 not out. It has been 10 years. He would have been 36 this Saturday. I once saw an interview with a footballer whose daughter had died of a brain tumour. \u201cDid he feel cheated?\u201d the journalist asked. The footballer, the father, was flattened by that question. Of course, he eventually said. But she was the one who\u2019d been cheated. Those who loved Phillip Hughes spoke of the things he would now never get to do \u2013 regaining his Test spot, realising his talent, becoming a parent, retiring to breed Angus cattle. He was robbed of all that. It was a life celebrated and a life that will never be forgotten. But it was a life robbed nonetheless. I\u2019ll say it again \u2013 he would have been 36 this Saturday. Nothing we do as fans and nothing we write as journalists can properly meet the crushing desolation of that.",

Then a child, Boyle held the Guinness World Record for lowest limbo in roller skates, managing to get under a pole raised just 5.25 inches (13.35cm) off the ground.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty obscure, strange thing to do,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut that\u2019s what it was.\u201d</p> <p> Rollerskating was all the rage in the 1980s. One day at the roller rink she would frequent during school holidays, Boyle made a friend who invited her to join her roller-skating team. She did \u2013 and before long that team was tackling the Guinness record.</p> <p>She and her teammates each took turns making the attempt in an empty Sydney shopping mall after hours \u201cbecause the floor there was really smooth\u201d. On one of her last attempts, Boyle \u2013 a \u201cvery small\u201d human at this point in time \u2013 successfully limboed at the record height, a feat a few of her teammates equalled that day. A Guinness adjudicator was there to verify her attempt and Boyle remembers the nod they gave her after she successfully went under without knocking the pole.</p>    <p>\u201cIt was definitely the coolest thing to ever happen to a 10-year-old,\u201d Boyle says. Her parents took her to McDonald\u2019s on the way home to celebrate and the mayor of her local council presented Boyle with her Guinness certificate at school.</p> <p>Being a world record holder, however, has not had a particularly lasting impact on her life.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to say that I went on some kind of motivational speaking circuit or something like that. But, no, I didn\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cIt really put me up there in terms of coolness at primary school for the next couple of years. Then I got to high school and I aged out of limbo roller-skating, because it\u2019s not something you can really do once you hit puberty.\u201d</p> <p>Boyle didn\u2019t really skate again until Covid lockdowns, when she bought a pair of inline skates for a cheap thrill. Now it\u2019s just a fabulous party tale, perfect for rolling out after a few drinks.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a feel good 80s story, really, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018I could hardly imagine a better adventure\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Chris Turnbull \u2013 fastest run from Perth to Sydney</strong></p> <p>It takes 41 hours to drive from Perth to Sydney. To run it,<strong> </strong>it took Chris Turnbull 39 days, eight hours and one minute to run between the two cities.</p> <p>As the 40-year-old ultramarathon runner tells it, he didn\u2019t explicitly set out to smash the Guinness World Record in 2023. Turnbull really just wanted to tick off the 3,856km run because it seemed like a cool challenge.</p> <p>\u201cIt was really more about an interesting way of experiencing Australia, seeing the sites, meeting the people \u2013 as well as seeing how fast I could do it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Turnbull spent about four months in endurance training and logistical preparation to get ready for his run across Australia\u2019s most remote stretches. When he set off, he was joined on his journey by crew cars, who carried food, water, camping supplies and satellite phones. He ran for an average of 13 hours a day, with no rest days, his alarm going off at 4.30am each morning. He had dodge passing trucks on the way, as the sealed highway was the only manageable terrain on which to run.</p>    <p>Turnbull remembers the mix of fulfilment, relief and satisfaction that came over him when he saw the ocean at Manly Beach finally come into view. Overwhelmed with emotion, he \u201csat down on the stairs of an apartment block and burst out in tears\u201d. Turnbull stayed there and cried for about a minute, took another five to compose himself, then got up and ran the final few hundred metres to the finish line where friends, family and news crews were waiting to greet him. He was sprayed with some celebratory champagne then promptly \u201cjust laid down on the ground\u201d, before heading off to the pub.</p> <p>But it was a long road back for his body. Turnbull couldn\u2019t sleep when he first got home \u2013 his limbs in too much pain to allow it \u2013 yet battled a waking fatigue so intense it was also difficult to get out of bed. He dealt with both nerve damage and muscle atrophy in his first months after finishing. Between training and the run he\u2019d lost 8kg. And he had significant sun damage on the left side of his body, where the sun hit every day (the only way to describe it, he says, is \u201clizard skin\u201d).</p> <p>All told, it took about six months for his body to get back to normal functioning \u2013 though Turnbull has now returned to running a comparatively easy 24km a day, to and from his job as an engineer. But it sure was an interesting experience.</p> <p>\u201cI could hardly imagine there being a better adventure,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was incredible. I have the most intense and vivid memories of things so different from normal life. I went there for a lifesize adventure, and absolutely got it.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Changed my whole world\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Anthony Kelly \u2013 most arrows caught by hand in one minute (and about 60 more)</strong></p> <p>Anthony Kelly was watching the 1985 movie The Last Dragon when he had the idea that changed his life.</p> <p>In that film, a karate student is tasked with catching an arrow with his bare hands. Kelly, a martial artist who often did demonstrations like \u201cboard-breaking or smashing concrete with my head\u201d, felt inspired to try and catch an arrow himself. So he decided to attempt the feat at the Chinese restaurant in his home town of Armidale in 1991.</p> <p>\u201cIt blew out a lot bigger than I anticipated \u2013 the local news, the TV, everyone came down,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI ended up catching a few arrows and sent the footage over to Guinness \u2026 I thought they may be interested in it as a world record.\u201d</p>    <p>They were \u2013 he was flown out to Madrid six weeks later to catch arrows again at a Guinness event. Becoming a record holder \u201cchanged my whole world\u201d, Kelly says.</p> <p>He went from never having been overseas to regularly travelling the globe to tackle other agility-based records. The profile Guinness gave him has led to martial arts demonstrations on the TV show Mythbusters and work as a forensic martial arts specialist in a murder case for the New South Wales police force. Along the way, he\u2019s become friends with other world record holders, including the most pierced lady in the world (\u201cwho I speak to on a weekly basis,\u201d he says). Kelly now teaches martial arts for a living.</p> <p>Since that day in 1991, Kelly has attained over 60 further Guinness World Records, including most paintball bullets caught in two minutes (11) and most spears caught underwater in one minute (10). (He\u2019s also bettered his own original record for most arrows caught by hand in one minute, taking it up to 17.)</p> <p>\u201cIt just kept going and going and going,\u201d the now 60-year-old says. \u201cIt\u2019s not about catching something, but it\u2019s about setting a goal to achieve a specific thing in life.\u201d</p> <p>But there have been some failures along the way as well. One time, while he had a Guinness adjudicator around to oversee another record attempt (the largest human wheelbarrow race, with 1,554 participants), he decided to tackle the title of most Ferrero Rocher chocolates eaten in one minute. Kelly didn\u2019t bother practising ahead of time because he figured it would be easy to smash the current record of three. He was wrong.</p> <p>\u201cAfter you eat one, you have to clear your mouth, open your mouth, show the adjudicator, and then start the second one,\u201d he says. The chunky almonds in the chocolate, he remembers, slowed him right down.</p> <p>With TV news there to capture his big moment, he managed only three \u2013 failing to better the record. Kelly gave the large boxes of leftover chocolates he had bought, expecting to eat, to some schoolchildren who\u2019d come to watch.</p> <p>The chocolates came with a word of hard-won advice: \u201cIf you\u2019re ever going to go for a world record, make sure that you practise first.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018It\u2019s pitch black down there, and you\u2019re just sinking alone\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Ant Williams \u2013 deepest dive under ice</strong></p> <p>Ant Williams was working as a psychologist for athletes involved in high-risk sports such as speed skiing, base jumping and moto GP when he had an epiphany: \u201cI was a total fraud.</p> <p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t done any sport \u2026 yet here I was teaching the world\u2019s best how to tear down a racing track faster, or ride big waves, but it was all from a textbook.</p> <p>\u201cI decided that I needed to gain some lived experience.\u201d</p>    <p>So Williams did what any dedicated professional would do: took up free diving so he could understand what it\u2019s like to put your body on the line.</p> <p>That was in 2001. By 2019, Williams had become so successful as a competitive free diver that decided to go for the Guinness World Record \u2013 not just for deepest free dive, but deepest free dive under ice.</p> <p>He travelled to Kirkenes in far north-eastern Norway to go for the record, joined by a support crew. \u201cIt was one of the warmer days when we arrived, -36C,\u201d Williams remembers. It took nine hours to cut a hole in the ice on a frozen lake. Once the hole was ready, he had to get out of his snowmobile and into the water within one minute, otherwise he risked hypothermia. Williams then had to retrieve a flag that had been dropped 70 metres beneath the water by the crew to secure the record.</p>    <p>The total dive time was only about two minutes and 40 seconds \u2013 but it was a terrifying couple of minutes.</p> <p>\u201cOnce you go into the ice water it\u2019s pitch black down there, and you\u2019re just sinking alone, freefalling by yourself,\u201d Williams says. So the feeling of successfully snatching the flag and getting back to the surface was more one of relief than anything else.</p> <p>He has since launched a career as a keynote speaker. The glory of the record, he says, has \u201copened a few really nice doors for me\u201d. But the biggest perk of the title was closer to home.</p> <p>\u201cAt the time, my daughter was 10. She comes home from school one day and she goes, \u2018Oh my God, Dad, I was at the library today with all my friends and you were on the inside cover of the Guinness World Record book. All my friends just freaked out!\u2019 So that was a really lovely moment.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m going to be the record holder as long as I am on this Earth\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Omkar Palav \u2013 fastest time to type the alphabet with nose</strong></p> <p>Omkar Palav isn\u2019t an extreme athlete or a brazen daredevil. He\u2019s an IT worker who, by his own description, \u201cis very good at typing\u201d.</p> <p>For years, Palav had dreamed of claiming a Guinness World Record. He found appeal in the idea of having secured a clear, tangible achievement. So he started looking for a record he could claim without risking life or limb, and eventually set his sights on becoming the fastest person to type the alphabet using their nose.</p>    <p>After a lot of practice \u2013 the trick is memorising where each of the keys are located, he says \u2013 Palav did just that. On 20 July 2024, he managed the feat in 20 seconds and 51 milliseconds at a community centre in Adelaide.</p> <p>He hasn\u2019t had long to bask in the glory \u2013 there are other nose typists already plotting their own attempt, so Palav is planning to try and beat his own record soon so that he can retain the title.</p>    <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to try to be the record holder as long as I am on this Earth,\u201d he says. Because the effort is worth it: \u201cIt\u2019s not very easy to achieve. [But] achieving that gives inner happiness.\u201d</p>",

I went there for a lifesize adventure, and absolutely got it.\u201d \u2018Changed my whole world\u2019 Anthony Kelly \u2013 most arrows caught by hand in one minute (and about 60 more) Anthony Kelly was watching the 1985 movie The Last Dragon when he had the idea that changed his life. In that film, a karate student is tasked with catching an arrow with his bare hands. Kelly, a martial artist who often did demonstrations like \u201cboard-breaking or smashing concrete with my head\u201d, felt inspired to try and catch an arrow himself. So he decided to attempt the feat at the Chinese restaurant in his home town of Armidale in 1991. \u201cIt blew out a lot bigger than I anticipated \u2013 the local news, the TV, everyone came down,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI ended up catching a few arrows and sent the footage over to Guinness \u2026 I thought they may be interested in it as a world record.\u201d They were \u2013 he was flown out to Madrid six weeks later to catch arrows again at a Guinness event. Becoming a record holder \u201cchanged my whole world\u201d, Kelly says. He went from never having been overseas to regularly travelling the globe to tackle other agility-based records. The profile Guinness gave him has led to martial arts demonstrations on the TV show Mythbusters and work as a forensic martial arts specialist in a murder case for the New South Wales police force. Along the way, he\u2019s become friends with other world record holders, including the most pierced lady in the world (\u201cwho I speak to on a weekly basis,\u201d he says). Kelly now teaches martial arts for a living. Since that day in 1991, Kelly has attained over 60 further Guinness World Records, including most paintball bullets caught in two minutes (11) and most spears caught underwater in one minute (10). (He\u2019s also bettered his own original record for most arrows caught by hand in one minute, taking it up to 17.) \u201cIt just kept going and going and going,\u201d the now 60-year-old says. \u201cIt\u2019s not about catching something, but it\u2019s about setting a goal to achieve a specific thing in life.\u201d But there have been some failures along the way as well. One time, while he had a Guinness adjudicator around to oversee another record attempt (the largest human wheelbarrow race, with 1,554 participants), he decided to tackle the title of most Ferrero Rocher chocolates eaten in one minute. Kelly didn\u2019t bother practising ahead of time because he figured it would be easy to smash the current record of three. He was wrong. \u201cAfter you eat one, you have to clear your mouth, open your mouth, show the adjudicator, and then start the second one,\u201d he says. The chunky almonds in the chocolate, he remembers, slowed him right down. With TV news there to capture his big moment, he managed only three \u2013 failing to better the record. Kelly gave the large boxes of leftover chocolates he had bought, expecting to eat, to some schoolchildren who\u2019d come to watch. The chocolates came with a word of hard-won advice: \u201cIf you\u2019re ever going to go for a world record, make sure that you practise first.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s pitch black down there, and you\u2019re just sinking alone\u2019 Ant Williams \u2013 deepest dive under ice Ant Williams was working as a psychologist for athletes involved in high-risk sports such as speed skiing, base jumping and moto GP when he had an epiphany: \u201cI was a total fraud. \u201cI hadn\u2019t done any sport \u2026 yet here I was teaching the world\u2019s best how to tear down a racing track faster, or ride big waves, but it was all from a textbook. \u201cI decided that I needed to gain some lived experience.\u201d So Williams did what any dedicated professional would do: took up free diving so he could understand what it\u2019s like to put your body on the line. That was in 2001. By 2019, Williams had become so successful as a competitive free diver that decided to go for the Guinness World Record \u2013 not just for deepest free dive, but deepest free dive under ice. He travelled to Kirkenes in far north-eastern Norway to go for the record, joined by a support crew. \u201cIt was one of the warmer days when we arrived, -36C,\u201d Williams remembers. It took nine hours to cut a hole in the ice on a frozen lake. Once the hole was ready, he had to get out of his snowmobile and into the water within one minute, otherwise he risked hypothermia. Williams then had to retrieve a flag that had been dropped 70 metres beneath the water by the crew to secure the record. The total dive time was only about two minutes and 40 seconds \u2013 but it was a terrifying couple of minutes. \u201cOnce you go into the ice water it\u2019s pitch black down there, and you\u2019re just sinking alone, freefalling by yourself,\u201d Williams says. So the feeling of successfully snatching the flag and getting back to the surface was more one of relief than anything else. He has since launched a career as a keynote speaker. The glory of the record, he says, has \u201copened a few really nice doors for me\u201d. But the biggest perk of the title was closer to home. \u201cAt the time, my daughter was 10. She comes home from school one day and she goes, \u2018Oh my God, Dad, I was at the library today with all my friends and you were on the inside cover of the Guinness World Record book. All my friends just freaked out!\u2019 So that was a really lovely moment.\u201d \u2018I\u2019m going to be the record holder as long as I am on this Earth\u2019 Omkar Palav \u2013 fastest time to type the alphabet with nose Omkar Palav isn\u2019t an extreme athlete or a brazen daredevil. He\u2019s an IT worker who, by his own description, \u201cis very good at typing\u201d. For years, Palav had dreamed of claiming a Guinness World Record. He found appeal in the idea of having secured a clear, tangible achievement. So he started looking for a record he could claim without risking life or limb, and eventually set his sights on becoming the fastest person to type the alphabet using their nose. After a lot of practice \u2013 the trick is memorising where each of the keys are located, he says \u2013 Palav did just that. On 20 July 2024, he managed the feat in 20 seconds and 51 milliseconds at a community centre in Adelaide. He hasn\u2019t had long to bask in the glory \u2013 there are other nose typists already plotting their own attempt, so Palav is planning to try and beat his own record soon so that he can retain the title. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to be the record holder as long as I am on this Earth,\u201d he says. Because the effort is worth it: \u201cIt\u2019s not very easy to achieve. [But] achieving that gives inner happiness.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>During a Labour away day ahead of the last election, the party\u2019s candidates were put through their paces as parliamentary debaters. The topic chosen, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/assisted-suicide\">assisted dying</a>, was a deliberately intractable issue designed to test their analytical skills. Yet just months later, scores of new MPs find themselves having to make a very real decision over changing the law.</p>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m genuinely the most back and forth on this that I\u2019ve been on anything,\u201d said one new MP who has found themselves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/17/the-assisted-dying-debate-charles-falconer-and-the-observers-sonia-sodha-tackle-the-issues\">on either side of the debate</a> over recent months. Like so many, with the issues so finely balanced in their mind, a single conversation can sway their thinking.</p> <p>\u201cI had a conversation during the election campaign with a woman whose husband was on a [syringe] driver for 12 days,\u201d the MP said. \u201cI can honestly say that conversation really changed my mind and put me in the pro camp. But the challenge for the people who are pro is whether they can convince everybody that this bill is narrow enough. I don\u2019t know what they could do prior to Friday to get that over.\u201d</p> <p>All MPs are now grappling over how they will vote in Friday\u2019s once-in-a-generation decision on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/22/what-are-the-key-issues-in-the-assisted-dying-bill-debate\">assisted dying bill</a> brought forward by Labour backbencher Kim Leadbeater. They talk of being bombarded with campaign material from the pro and anti campaigns, as well as being swayed by personal stories of friends, family and constituents.</p> <p>However, Labour MPs involved in that pre-election debate practice say it could never have prepared them for the real thing, as discussing the principle of assisted dying has given way to assessing the merits of the specific bill now before them. \u201cThe general public get to say whether they\u2019re pro or against it as a principle,\u201d said a Labour MP. \u201cThe MPs in the grey area now are the ones asking: \u2018How would this work?\u2019 We\u2019re trying to think of it pragmatically.\u201d</p> <p>MPs across the political divide said that there had been a large amount of lobbying in their inboxes, but they are taking very different approaches to reaching their final decisions. Some said they were talking at length to their colleagues to thrash out the issues. Others said they were keeping their thoughts to themselves.</p>    <p>While new MPs find themselves thrown into a major ethical debate only months into their career, Friday\u2019s free vote on the issue has been no easier for some veteran MPs. John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor who entered parliament in 1997, said he had thought about the issue for decades \u2013 but had only very recently switched in favour of backing the bill.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in parliament 27 years now,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has become a recurring debate every few years. It\u2019s a hardy perennial that comes back.</p> <p>\u201cUp until now, I was unsure and opposed previous attempts at assisted dying.

      "bodyText": "During a Labour away day ahead of the last election, the party\u2019s candidates were put through their paces as parliamentary debaters. The topic chosen, assisted dying, was a deliberately intractable issue designed to test their analytical skills. Yet just months later, scores of new MPs find themselves having to make a very real decision over changing the law. \u201cI\u2019m genuinely the most back and forth on this that I\u2019ve been on anything,\u201d said one new MP who has found themselves on either side of the debate over recent months. Like so many, with the issues so finely balanced in their mind, a single conversation can sway their thinking. \u201cI had a conversation during the election campaign with a woman whose husband was on a [syringe] driver for 12 days,\u201d the MP said. \u201cI can honestly say that conversation really changed my mind and put me in the pro camp. But the challenge for the people who are pro is whether they can convince everybody that this bill is narrow enough. I don\u2019t know what they could do prior to Friday to get that over.\u201d All MPs are now grappling over how they will vote in Friday\u2019s once-in-a-generation decision on the assisted dying bill brought forward by Labour backbencher Kim Leadbeater. They talk of being bombarded with campaign material from the pro and anti campaigns, as well as being swayed by personal stories of friends, family and constituents. However, Labour MPs involved in that pre-election debate practice say it could never have prepared them for the real thing, as discussing the principle of assisted dying has given way to assessing the merits of the specific bill now before them. \u201cThe general public get to say whether they\u2019re pro or against it as a principle,\u201d said a Labour MP. \u201cThe MPs in the grey area now are the ones asking: \u2018How would this work?\u2019 We\u2019re trying to think of it pragmatically.\u201d MPs across the political divide said that there had been a large amount of lobbying in their inboxes, but they are taking very different approaches to reaching their final decisions. Some said they were talking at length to their colleagues to thrash out the issues. Others said they were keeping their thoughts to themselves. While new MPs find themselves thrown into a major ethical debate only months into their career, Friday\u2019s free vote on the issue has been no easier for some veteran MPs. John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor who entered parliament in 1997, said he had thought about the issue for decades \u2013 but had only very recently switched in favour of backing the bill. \u201cI\u2019ve been in parliament 27 years now,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has become a recurring debate every few years. It\u2019s a hardy perennial that comes back. \u201cUp until now, I was unsure and opposed previous attempts at assisted dying. I was concerned, as everyone is, to make sure that we get it right and that there\u2019s safeguards in place. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to talk to as many organisations as possible. I\u2019ve read everything that\u2019s come into my inbox. I\u2019ve tried to interrogate the proposals as much as possible that Kim and others put forward. And so now, for the first time, I\u2019ve come to the view that, yes, I\u2019ll support an assisted dying bill. I think the safeguards that Kim has put forward are pretty strong. But again, if there are other improvements that could be made, I\u2019m open minded to looking at those. But as a matter of principle, I now think we need to move forward on it.\u201d As it is a free vote, there are figures from the political left and right on both sides. Former Tory cabinet ministers Kit Malthouse and David Davis are among the leading advocates for a change in the law. It is also an issue that has divided politicians who have almost always agreed. McDonnell will be voting in the opposite division lobby to some of his oldest political fellow travellers on the left, including Diane Abbott. Jeremy Corbyn has also previously indicated he will oppose assisted dying. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to either Jeremy or Diane,\u201d he said. \u201cI will do, but it\u2019s not left or right.

      "bodyText": "A listeria outbreak linked to ready-to-eat meat and poultry products from a South Carolina food processor has caused 11 illnesses in four states, with nine hospitalizations, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A woman who was pregnant with twins was also sickened. Both of the fetuses died, but listeria was found in a sample from only one. The outbreak was traced to Yu Shang Food Inc, a Spartanburg-based company. Its products were shipped to retailers nationwide and were available online. A recall of 72,000lbs of meat and poultry products was issued because possible listeria contamination is in effect, the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) said in an advisory. Listeria monocytogenes bacteria causes listeriosis, the third most common form of food poisoning, which can cause invasive intestinal illness and is considered dangerous to pregnant women, children and people over 65. The CDC said seven listeria cases had been reported in California, two in Illinois, and one each in New York and New Jersey. Seven people said they shopped in person or online at markets where Yu Shang products were sold and two people said they ate Yu Shang ready-to-eat chicken. \u201cIn California, one pregnant person and their twins were sick and both [fetuses] died,\u201d the agency said. \u201cListeria was found in a sample from the mother and from one of the twin [fetuses], but it could not be found in a sample from the other [fetus]. Because of this, only the mother and one twin are included as confirmed cases in this outbreak. One other listeria illness was reported in a fetus who was sick and recovered.\u201d The company told CNN that although the woman reported eating the company\u2019s products before she became ill, there was no proof that they were the cause. But the FSIS determined that there was a link between the ready-to-eat meat and poultry products from Yu Shang Food Inc and the illness clusters. The agency said it was concerned that some product may be in consumers\u2019 refrigerators and freezers. \u201cConsumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase,\u201d it said. The listeria outbreak comes days after organic carrots were recalled after being found to be contaminated with E coli. The products, from Grimmway Farms and sold at Trader Joe\u2019s, Wegmans and Target, were connected to 39 E coli infections, including 15 hospitalizations and one death. On Wednesday, F&amp;S Fresh Foods recalled two Whole Foods Market products \u2013 organic carrot sticks and a combo pack of organic carrot sticks and celery \u2013 produced by the same supplier.",

She cited the projected costs of the planned inquiry \u2013 about \u00a326m \u2013 as a reason for downgrading it to a much cheaper inquiry focusing on a review of documents, with an estimated cost of \u00a32.6m. In a legal challenge against this decision that opened in the high court last week, new information was disclosed for the first time by the government, revealing the scale of what went wrong at Manston in the period from 1 June to 22 November 2022. The documents also show that Home Office staff had no reliable data about Manston between September and November 2022 \u201cas we completely lost our grip on it\u201d. Lawyers for the asylum seekers bringing the high court challenge said in their written submissions: \u201cIt appears to be uncontroversial that there was large-scale law-breaking by the defendants\u2019 department [the Home Office]\u201d, adding that multiple members of staff are involved in \u201callegations of systemic failure\u201d and that there is a need to examine \u201cquestions of management and institutional culture\u201d. One of the main questions the lawyers hope the inquiry will try to answer is whether either Patel or Braverman gave an order to stop transferring newly arrived asylum seekers from Manston to hotels because of criticism over the use of expensive accommodation to house them \u2013 a decision that led to the overcrowding crisis at the processing centre. According to documents submitted to the court: \u201cIn June 2022 operational commanders at Manston were told that \u2018the hotel pipeline has been switched off\u2019.\u201d Lewis Kett, a solicitor at Duncan Lewis, who is representing some of the asylum seekers in the case, said: \u201cThe numbers likely detained unlawfully at Manston are entirely unprecedented and the conditions they were held in were deplorable. \u201cAn independent inquiry will need the powers and resources to properly understand how this happened to learn lessons and prevent an incident like this occurring again.\u201d Home Office sources said they do not comment on continuing legal proceedings. Patel and Braverman were approached for comment.",

Here he is at his best and most sympathetic. As Cromwell, we watch him safeguard the victimised adolescent Mary Tudor, coaching her to negotiate her way out of looming execution at the hands of her axe-happy father, Henry. (Cromwell made a promise to Mary\u2019s dying mother, you see, and he\u2019s a sweetie like that.)</p> <p>We follow him as he tracks down another obstreperous girl, the illegitimate daughter of his late mentor Cardinal Wolsey, promising her the world and his own hand in marriage (sex optional) if she\u2019ll only see sense and escape her Catholic monastery before conflict comes to its doors.

It was key to her judicial murder on manufactured charges of adultery, for it put her on a collision course with Cromwell\u2019s plan to reassign the estates to personal allies and crown loyalists.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Cromwell was a self-taught Renaissance man. He also rewrote the constitution and bullied parliament into submission in the service of a dictator</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But Rylance\u2019s Cromwell explains that even this campaign of corruption has a saintly agenda. \u201cOnce these lands are given away to King Henry and to his gentlemen, they\u2019ll never return to the church. Prayers can be rewritten, but not leases.\u201d In this version of history, Cromwell\u2019s forgeries and seizures are all necessary to defend good Englishmen against a regressive counter-Reformation. \u201cThen we\u2019ll have change, Gregory,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe poor will have good-living clergy who counsel the ignorant and help the unfortunate.\u201d The largest Tudor enrichment programme for the Protestant aristocracy turns out to have been for the benefit of the poor.</p> <p>This is not the real Thomas Cromwell. It is true that the Tudor politician was a strategic, careful and self-taught Renaissance man. He was also a killer who rewrote a nation\u2019s constitution and bullied its parliament into submission in the service of an impulsive dictator. Now, as Donald Trump returns to the White House, we need to be clear-eyed about the men who enable tyrants. When we whitewash Cromwell\u2019s legacy, we blind ourselves to the warning he offers us.</p> <p>Cromwell did help reconcile Mary Tudor with her father, but largely for reasons of self-preservation. Even Cromwell\u2019s sympathetic biographer, Diarmaid MacCulloch, acknowledges that \u201che realised what a catastrophe the execution of the king\u2019s daughter would be for the monarchy\u201d. In the armed revolt that would almost certainly have followed (Mary was a beloved Catholic figurehead), Cromwell would have been first up against the wall. There is no evidence that Cromwell made any kind of sentimental promise to Mary\u2019s mother, or ever visited Wolsey\u2019s daughter.</p> <p>This is no disparagement to Mantel\u2019s book <em>The Mirror and The Light</em>: her late novels are once-in-a-century acts of imagination. They are powered by her lifelong curiosity about how humans maintain a sense of self in any society in which the fundamentals are in flux. Her 1992 novel about the French Revolution, <em>A Place of Greater Safety</em><em>, </em>seemed to predict the rage and fury of the Brexit era, 25 years before we lived it. Her first book in the <em>Wolf Hall </em>series was right to deconstruct the myth of Thomas More, a man sainted by the Catholic church but who doled out little mercy to the Protestant prisoners of conscience whom he caged, racked and burned.</p> <p>Mantel always understood that Henry VIII was a tyrant; TV writer Peter Straughan makes him a psychopath, played by a cold-eyed Damian Lewis. This is a psychological reading of Henry that is gaining currency: the recent movie <em>Firebrand</em><em>, </em>which shows a desperate Katherine Parr scheming to survive his brutality, takes a similar approach.</p> <p>For my own PhD thesis, I examined Parr\u2019s role in the education of the young Elizabeth&nbsp;I, a significant plot strand of <em>Firebrand</em>. The film captures Parr\u2019s yearning for independence and self-realisation through her own theological scholarship, but dives off the deep end into levels of ahistorical melodrama that Mantel would never have countenanced.</p> <p>With more nuance, the historian Suzannah Lipscomb has argued that the pivot of Henry\u2019s VIII\u2019s development into a monster came in 1536 \u2013 perhaps less due to psychological psychopathy than the permanent pain he lived with after that year thanks to a jousting accident that left him with an ulcerous leg.</p> <p>Whether or not Henry was a psychopath, Cromwell was a familiar figure, the legal officer who facilitated the human rights abuses of a despot in the highest office. Tudor monarchs aimed to bend the law to their will, but they were always constrained by its basic principles. Cromwell made a career of finding legal excuses for Henry\u2019s diktats.</p> <p>This makes him a poor role model for our times. Last week, Trump unveiled his own list of Thomas Cromwells: the yes men and enablers who will frame US law to fulfil his wishes. First on the agenda is Trump\u2019s promise to deport the full undocumented population, thought to include 11 million migrants.</p> <p>In an essay for the <em>New York Times, </em>the immigration expert Dara Lind explained that such a policy will rely on lawyers and logistics experts willing to lend their skills to help Trump build \u201ca deportation machine\u201d \u2013 constructing vast new holding centres, and browbeating third-party countries into letting planes land. These are pragmatic skills in which Cromwell excelled. They are not heroic.</p> <p>Mantel\u2019s original novels are more morally complicated. <em>The Mirror and the Light</em><em>, </em>as a text, was never an exoneration of&nbsp;Cromwell but a Faustian narrative in which our unreliable narrator slowly comes to realise his own moral decay. In the most revelatory chapter, he is confronted by his betrayal of the Protestant William Tyndale. The TV series, so far, has missed this point. In an era which demands that we each examine our political conscience, that is an unforgivable mistake.</p> <p>\u2022 Kate Maltby writes about theatre, politics and culture</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Prayers can be rewritten, but not leases.\u201d In this version of history, Cromwell\u2019s forgeries and seizures are all necessary to defend good Englishmen against a regressive counter-Reformation. \u201cThen we\u2019ll have change, Gregory,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe poor will have good-living clergy who counsel the ignorant and help the unfortunate.\u201d The largest Tudor enrichment programme for the Protestant aristocracy turns out to have been for the benefit of the poor. This is not the real Thomas Cromwell. It is true that the Tudor politician was a strategic, careful and self-taught Renaissance man. He was also a killer who rewrote a nation\u2019s constitution and bullied its parliament into submission in the service of an impulsive dictator. Now, as Donald Trump returns to the White House, we need to be clear-eyed about the men who enable tyrants. When we whitewash Cromwell\u2019s legacy, we blind ourselves to the warning he offers us. Cromwell did help reconcile Mary Tudor with her father, but largely for reasons of self-preservation. Even Cromwell\u2019s sympathetic biographer, Diarmaid MacCulloch, acknowledges that \u201che realised what a catastrophe the execution of the king\u2019s daughter would be for the monarchy\u201d. In the armed revolt that would almost certainly have followed (Mary was a beloved Catholic figurehead), Cromwell would have been first up against the wall. There is no evidence that Cromwell made any kind of sentimental promise to Mary\u2019s mother, or ever visited Wolsey\u2019s daughter. This is no disparagement to Mantel\u2019s book The Mirror and The Light: her late novels are once-in-a-century acts of imagination. They are powered by her lifelong curiosity about how humans maintain a sense of self in any society in which the fundamentals are in flux. Her 1992 novel about the French Revolution, A Place of Greater Safety, seemed to predict the rage and fury of the Brexit era, 25 years before we lived it. Her first book in the Wolf Hall series was right to deconstruct the myth of Thomas More, a man sainted by the Catholic church but who doled out little mercy to the Protestant prisoners of conscience whom he caged, racked and burned. Mantel always understood that Henry VIII was a tyrant; TV writer Peter Straughan makes him a psychopath, played by a cold-eyed Damian Lewis. This is a psychological reading of Henry that is gaining currency: the recent movie Firebrand, which shows a desperate Katherine Parr scheming to survive his brutality, takes a similar approach. For my own PhD thesis, I examined Parr\u2019s role in the education of the young Elizabeth I, a significant plot strand of Firebrand. The film captures Parr\u2019s yearning for independence and self-realisation through her own theological scholarship, but dives off the deep end into levels of ahistorical melodrama that Mantel would never have countenanced. With more nuance, the historian Suzannah Lipscomb has argued that the pivot of Henry\u2019s VIII\u2019s development into a monster came in 1536 \u2013 perhaps less due to psychological psychopathy than the permanent pain he lived with after that year thanks to a jousting accident that left him with an ulcerous leg. Whether or not Henry was a psychopath, Cromwell was a familiar figure, the legal officer who facilitated the human rights abuses of a despot in the highest office. Tudor monarchs aimed to bend the law to their will, but they were always constrained by its basic principles. Cromwell made a career of finding legal excuses for Henry\u2019s diktats. This makes him a poor role model for our times. Last week, Trump unveiled his own list of Thomas Cromwells: the yes men and enablers who will frame US law to fulfil his wishes. First on the agenda is Trump\u2019s promise to deport the full undocumented population, thought to include 11 million migrants. In an essay for the New York Times, the immigration expert Dara Lind explained that such a policy will rely on lawyers and logistics experts willing to lend their skills to help Trump build \u201ca deportation machine\u201d \u2013 constructing vast new holding centres, and browbeating third-party countries into letting planes land. These are pragmatic skills in which Cromwell excelled. They are not heroic. Mantel\u2019s original novels are more morally complicated. The Mirror and the Light, as a text, was never an exoneration of Cromwell but a Faustian narrative in which our unreliable narrator slowly comes to realise his own moral decay. In the most revelatory chapter, he is confronted by his betrayal of the Protestant William Tyndale. The TV series, so far, has missed this point. In an era which demands that we each examine our political conscience, that is an unforgivable mistake. \u2022 Kate Maltby writes about theatre, politics and culture Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I was aware of how much I missed the countryside, even though I\u2019m a Londoner who\u2019s never really lived in the countryside. I was aware how difficult it was for friends living alone, and I was aware how difficult communication was becoming. After lockdown, I found myself tongue-tied and awkward.

At the same time I\u2019m aware of how a moment on the tube \u2013 a look, a remark \u2013 can flare up into something that can change the course of a life.

I\u2019ve tried to write six comic novels now and this is the first time I\u2019ve been nominated. There\u2019s no contradiction between writing a comedy and writing something that\u2019s about melancholy or depression or alcoholism.

I\u2019d always love to do another draft post-publication. I don\u2019t open the document that will be the novel until quite late; for a year I just scribble jokes and observations and character sketches and ideas for scenes in a big sketchbook. The first draft is always straining too much to be funny, a bit like someone trying too hard at a party.</p> <p><strong>What about the business of plotting?</strong><br>I did struggle with getting to an ending. The original ending never worked because [one character] had to forgive so much in such a short period of time \u2013 it felt degrading. My books are often about fundamentally decent people making mistakes for perfectly understandable reasons. Dealing with the question of how you forgive people when they hurt you became a question of what I needed to do to not leave the reader feeling a character had done something so implausible that they\u2019re going to throw the book across the room.<br><strong><br>Which character came first?</strong><br>Marnie [the copy editor]. It was initially a novel about cinema-going: two people who meet at matinees then start going together, rather than independently; a love story told in films. Parallel to this, I had another idea \u2013 a family on a walking holiday \u2013so I just transposed the movie-going characters into that landscape because it seemed an interesting mismatch to do a classic urban romcom in a field in the rain. I\u2019d love to go back and try to write about film, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/jun/22/jeremy-cooper-novel-brian-my-agent-strongly-advised-me-against-writing-fiction\">Jeremy Cooper</a>\u2019s wonderful novel <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/brian-9781804270363/\">Brian</a></em> made me doubt my ability to write so well about cinema. It\u2019s a book about films as a partial antidote to loneliness; he\u2019s done it so beautifully, I don\u2019t think I can do it now.<br><br><strong>You\u2019ve spoken previously about the influence of Thomas Hardy, whose </strong><em><strong>Tess of the D\u2019Urbervilles</strong></em><strong> you <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b00dnhxw/tess-of-the-durbervilles\">adapted for TV</a>. Do you still read him?</strong><br>Not for years. The terrible truth is that when you adapt a book, it kind of kills that book as soon as you finish working on it. If I were to come to Hardy now, having never read any, I\u2019m not sure how much I\u2019d like him. At 16, I probably was a lot more forgiving of Angel Clare.<br><br><strong>Which other writers inspired you growing up?</strong><br>Sue Townsend was massive: I remember reading <em>Adrian Mole</em> and thinking, I wonder if I can do this? I was one of those kids who lived for TV comedy. <em>Monty Python</em>, <em>Not the Nine O\u2019Clock News</em>, <em>The Young Ones</em> \u2013 all that was thrilling. Victoria Wood was someone I just revered. The first attempts I made at what you might call writing \u2013 I didn\u2019t think of it as that \u2013 were dabbling in comedy at university, but I thought of it more as being an actor. I did try hard to be funny, and I\u2019m not! I\u2019m genuinely deathly at a dinner party: I can\u2019t tell a joke, I can\u2019t tell stories particularly well. So I guess I welcome the fact that [as a writer] you can just sit by yourself and make everything just so.<br><br><strong>What are you reading right now?</strong><br>I\u2019m really enjoying the Sally Rooney [<em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/intermezzo-9780571365463/\">Intermezzo</a></em>]. She\u2019s very humane, very smart and honest about love \u2013 a fantastic analyst of emotions. That close attention to characters in their lives, that\u2019s what I admire.<br><br><strong>What book did you last give as a gift?</strong><br>Alan Hollinghurst\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/our-evenings-9781447208235/\">Our Evenings</a></em>, which I also admired very much. The feeling of having a book pressed in your hands is wonderful, but I\u2019m starting to worry I\u2019ll never get to the bottom of the pile I want to read. It\u2019s a source of some guilt and anxiety for me. <br><br>\u2022 <em>You Are Here</em> by David Nicholls is published by Sceptre (\u00a320)<em>. </em>To support the <em>Guardian</em> and <em>Observer</em> order your copy at <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/you-are-here-9781444715446/\">guardianbookshop.com</a>.

Parallel to this, I had another idea \u2013 a family on a walking holiday \u2013so I just transposed the movie-going characters into that landscape because it seemed an interesting mismatch to do a classic urban romcom in a field in the rain. I\u2019d love to go back and try to write about film, but Jeremy Cooper\u2019s wonderful novel Brian made me doubt my ability to write so well about cinema. It\u2019s a book about films as a partial antidote to loneliness; he\u2019s done it so beautifully, I don\u2019t think I can do it now. You\u2019ve spoken previously about the influence of Thomas Hardy, whose Tess of the D\u2019Urbervilles you adapted for TV. Do you still read him? Not for years. The terrible truth is that when you adapt a book, it kind of kills that book as soon as you finish working on it. If I were to come to Hardy now, having never read any, I\u2019m not sure how much I\u2019d like him. At 16, I probably was a lot more forgiving of Angel Clare. Which other writers inspired you growing up? Sue Townsend was massive: I remember reading Adrian Mole and thinking, I wonder if I can do this? I was one of those kids who lived for TV comedy. Monty Python, Not the Nine O\u2019Clock News, The Young Ones \u2013 all that was thrilling. Victoria Wood was someone I just revered. The first attempts I made at what you might call writing \u2013 I didn\u2019t think of it as that \u2013 were dabbling in comedy at university, but I thought of it more as being an actor. I did try hard to be funny, and I\u2019m not! I\u2019m genuinely deathly at a dinner party: I can\u2019t tell a joke, I can\u2019t tell stories particularly well. So I guess I welcome the fact that [as a writer] you can just sit by yourself and make everything just so. What are you reading right now? I\u2019m really enjoying the Sally Rooney [Intermezzo]. She\u2019s very humane, very smart and honest about love \u2013 a fantastic analyst of emotions. That close attention to characters in their lives, that\u2019s what I admire. What book did you last give as a gift? Alan Hollinghurst\u2019s Our Evenings, which I also admired very much. The feeling of having a book pressed in your hands is wonderful, but I\u2019m starting to worry I\u2019ll never get to the bottom of the pile I want to read. It\u2019s a source of some guilt and anxiety for me. \u2022 You Are Here by David Nicholls is published by Sceptre (\u00a320).

In the end, a point against Stoke was something to embrace, particularly after an agonising first-half miss from the hosts\u2019 struggling centre-forward Zan Celar.</p> \n<p>Signed in the summer from the Swiss side Lugano, Celar stepped up for a penalty in the 27th minute, this the perfect opportunity to finally score for his new club and equalise after a thunderous Tom Cannon opener just minutes earlier.</p> \n<p>Fifteen previous league appearances had brought zilch, but his own fans waited behind the goal ready to partake in this moment of exultation. Instead Celar shot wide, despite the goal music briefly blaring out. The visiting support cackled from the other end.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/championship-roundup-burnley-beat-bristol-city-as-blades-held-to-a-draw\">Championship roundup: Burnley beat Bristol City as Blades held to a draw</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cTo have the courage to take the penalty, he has all my confidence,\u201d said Mart\u00ed Cifuentes, QPR\u2019s head coach. \u201cIf you are not a good player, you are not top-scorer in the Swiss league or you don\u2019t play for the national team. He\u2019s in a difficult moment.\u201d</p> \n<p>QPR did not let it get in the way, a Ben Gibson own goal later reviving them, before defeat was avoided when a late strike from Bae Jun-ho was disallowed, with an apparent handball in the buildup.</p> \n<p>A draw would have to suffice for a club that have grown accustomed to constant frustration in the decade since their last Premier League stay. Managers and players come and go at QPR but the season\u2019s end remains roughly the same: fifty-something points and no significant cup runs.</p> \n<p>Brief moments of hope occasionally poke through. In the summer there was optimism from Cifuentes\u2019s work since joining last October when QPR were second-bottom. He kept the ball on the carpet and solidified things at the back. Style brought safety and whispers of hope, at the very least the sense this season would not bring trouble. But volatility is part of the equation here, it has to be for a club that once counted Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore as owners. Cue the return to reality: they walked into this fixture with one league win this season.</p> \n<p>A reliable goalscorer has been lacking since Charlie Austin\u2019s first spell at QPR and Celar is the latest proposal. The Slovenian had an early shot blocked in a game that began with little fluency. Instead it was his counterpart, an in-form Cannon, who opened the scoring midway through the first half, his confidence obvious as he cut in from the left and curled in from just inside the area, his entire team congregating by the dugout to celebrate.</p> \n<p>QPR did not pity themselves. Paul Smyth rampaged into the box from the right and was tripped up by Eric Bocat just minutes later. A leveller awaited but Celar could not provide it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you\u2019re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The hosts created more chances but there remained little threat and QPR\u2019s tragicomic energy carried on after the break when the left-back Harrison Ashby caught the ball by the touchline while still in play.</p> \n<p>Some spirit remained. Smyth and Koki Saito, QPR\u2019s wide men, caused trouble with their direct running. Ashby hit the post with a deflected effort and then came the deserved fortune just after the hour mark. Saito dinked in a corner and Gibson diverted it into his own net.</p> \n<p>In the race for a winner, Cannon threatened again, a stinging shot from the right prompting an excellent low save from the impressive Paul Nardi. Saito was QPR\u2019s chief weapon, quick feet inside the box to go with a desire to pepper the net: the ground was roaring when he had a deflected shot sent wide in the final quarter. That was as loud as it would get.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A win was what Queens Park Rangers, bottom of the Championship, required. In the end, a point against Stoke was something to embrace, particularly after an agonising first-half miss from the hosts\u2019 struggling centre-forward Zan Celar. Signed in the summer from the Swiss side Lugano, Celar stepped up for a penalty in the 27th minute, this the perfect opportunity to finally score for his new club and equalise after a thunderous Tom Cannon opener just minutes earlier. Fifteen previous league appearances had brought zilch, but his own fans waited behind the goal ready to partake in this moment of exultation. Instead Celar shot wide, despite the goal music briefly blaring out. The visiting support cackled from the other end. \u201cTo have the courage to take the penalty, he has all my confidence,\u201d said Mart\u00ed Cifuentes, QPR\u2019s head coach. \u201cIf you are not a good player, you are not top-scorer in the Swiss league or you don\u2019t play for the national team. He\u2019s in a difficult moment.\u201d QPR did not let it get in the way, a Ben Gibson own goal later reviving them, before defeat was avoided when a late strike from Bae Jun-ho was disallowed, with an apparent handball in the buildup. A draw would have to suffice for a club that have grown accustomed to constant frustration in the decade since their last Premier League stay. Managers and players come and go at QPR but the season\u2019s end remains roughly the same: fifty-something points and no significant cup runs. Brief moments of hope occasionally poke through. In the summer there was optimism from Cifuentes\u2019s work since joining last October when QPR were second-bottom. He kept the ball on the carpet and solidified things at the back. Style brought safety and whispers of hope, at the very least the sense this season would not bring trouble. But volatility is part of the equation here, it has to be for a club that once counted Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore as owners. Cue the return to reality: they walked into this fixture with one league win this season. A reliable goalscorer has been lacking since Charlie Austin\u2019s first spell at QPR and Celar is the latest proposal. The Slovenian had an early shot blocked in a game that began with little fluency. Instead it was his counterpart, an in-form Cannon, who opened the scoring midway through the first half, his confidence obvious as he cut in from the left and curled in from just inside the area, his entire team congregating by the dugout to celebrate. QPR did not pity themselves. Paul Smyth rampaged into the box from the right and was tripped up by Eric Bocat just minutes later. A leveller awaited but Celar could not provide it. The hosts created more chances but there remained little threat and QPR\u2019s tragicomic energy carried on after the break when the left-back Harrison Ashby caught the ball by the touchline while still in play. Some spirit remained. Smyth and Koki Saito, QPR\u2019s wide men, caused trouble with their direct running. Ashby hit the post with a deflected effort and then came the deserved fortune just after the hour mark. Saito dinked in a corner and Gibson diverted it into his own net. In the race for a winner, Cannon threatened again, a stinging shot from the right prompting an excellent low save from the impressive Paul Nardi. Saito was QPR\u2019s chief weapon, quick feet inside the box to go with a desire to pepper the net: the ground was roaring when he had a deflected shot sent wide in the final quarter. That was as loud as it would get.",

      "bodyText": "And with that, my time at the coalface is done. Here\u2019s the Manchester City v Tottenham liveblog. Enjoy! And here\u2019s a cheeky Championship match report from Taha Hashim at Loftus Road: And Joao Pedro pulled the strings as Brighton beat Bournemouth in what seems to have been something of a heist. Just look at those stats! Fulham were comprehensively undone at home by Wolves, with John Brewin in attendance: When so many have doubted him, Gary O\u2019Neil fights on. And on. While Wolves have Matheus Cunha to hand and in such form there will be hope of redemption. The Brazilian, with two fine finishes and an adept assist, made it two wins in succession, catching Fulham cold before killing them off with a spectacular strike as they pushed for a late equaliser. After breaking their winless duck by beating Southampton, and surviving the international break that can be so deadly for managers, O\u2019Neil\u2019s employment prospects, bleak for much of the season, take a turn for the positive. Victory at Fulham was a coup. Wolves had soundly beaten a club in a position their owners aspire to. Much more here: Will Unwin got to see Aston Villa end their losing run by snatching a home point against Crystal Palace: Dean Smith was the last Aston Villa manager to lose five matches in a row and he was sacked for the failure. The situation was not as severe for Unai Emery but he needed to end a run of four straight defeats, although will be left wondering how his side did not beat Crystal Palace. Ollie Watkins and Ross Barkley twice equalised for Aston Villa, who also saw a Youri Tielemans penalty saved, after being hit on the break by Palace, resulting in Ismaila Sarr and Justin Devenny giving them the lead. Villa were dominant from the start but lacked the cutting edge expected of a Champions League side. Much more here: Jonathan Wilson was at the Emirates Stadium to see Arsenal outclass Nottingham Forest: It was the first day of the rest of their season. After a patchy start to the campaign, littered with red cards and brain fades, double saves and points needlessly dropped, what Arsenal needed more than anything else was a straightforward win. It\u2019s in the routine Saturday 3pm kick-offs just as much as in the live televised clashes, and in wins ticked off, almost without incident, far more than in the great expenditures of energy, that championships are decided. Arsenal may or may not be challenging for the title in May but this at last was a performance and result that allowed them to believe they may yet be able to recover from a run of two points from their previous four games. Much more here: The match reports are landing! Here\u2019s Andy Hunter at Goodison Park: Trouble is brewing for Sean Dyche as The Friedkin Group await approval on their proposed takeover of Everton. The Everton manager was left in no doubt as to the growing discontent inside Goodison Park after Brentford held out for 53 minutes with 10 men to take their first Premier League away point of the season. They did so with relatively little trouble, which said everything about Everton\u2019s second half display. The Brentford captain, Christian N\u00f8rgaard, was shown a straight red card for imprinting his studs into Jordan Pickford\u2019s knee four minutes before the interval. Everton had started brightly against the 11 men of Brentford but became increasingly clueless as the contest wore on. It is now five draws in eight league games for Dyche\u2019s team and no goals in three outings. An ominous December \u2013 which includes games against all of the top four, Ruben Amorim\u2019s first home league game as Manchester United manager, a revitalised Wolves and Nottingham Forest \u2013 now awaits. Much more here: Scott Murray is poised to take you through tonight\u2019s late kick-off: And here are the rest of the final scores. In the Championship only one goal was scored in the second half of all the games but one combined, while at Oxford there were four. Premier League Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest Aston Villa 2-2 Crystal Palace Bournemouth 1-2 Brighton Everton 0-0 Brentford Fulham 1-4 Wolverhampton Leicester City 1-2 Chelsea Manchester City v Tottenham (5pm) Championship Blackburn v Portsmouth (Postponed because of bad weather) Bristol City 0-1 Burnley Coventry 2-2 Sheff Utd Luton 1-0 Hull Millwall 0-1 Sunderland (still going because of a pause for a medical emergency in the crowd) Oxford Utd 2-6 Middlesbrough Preston North End 1-1 Derby QPR 1-1 Stoke Sheff Wed 1-1 Cardiff West Brom 2-2 Norwich League One Barnsley 0-1 Wigan Bolton 2-1 Blackpool Burton Albion 0-3 Stockport County Crawley Town 1-0 Rotherham Huddersfield 2-1 Charlton Lincoln City 2-3 Wycombe Mansfield 0-1 Bristol Rovers Northampton 0-0 Cambridge Utd Peterborough 1-2 Reading Shrewsbury 3-2 Birmingham Stevenage 0-0 Leyton Orient Wrexham 3-0 Exeter League Two AFC Wimbledon 0-1 Walsall Bradford v Accrington Stanley (postponed because of bad weather) Carlisle 0-0 Doncaster Chesterfield 1-0 Barrow Fleetwood Town v Milton Keynes (postponed because of bad weather) Gillingham 1-2 Harrogate Town Grimsby 0-1 Colchester Notts County 0-0 Newport County Salford City v Bromley (postponed because of a waterlogged pitch) Swindon 2-3 Morecambe Scottish Premiership Dundee v Hibernian (5.45) Hearts v Celtic (7.45) Rangers 0-1 Dundee Utd (kick-off delayed by 55 minutes, so still early in the second half there) Ross County 2-1 Motherwell (in stoppage time as I type) St Johnstone 1-0 Kilmarnock (also in stoppage time) St Mirren 1 Aberdeen (4pm kick-off) And it\u2019s all over! All five 3pm top-flight games are over, and the final scores are as follows: Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest Aston Villa 2-2 Crystal Palace Bournemouth 1-2 Brighton Everton 0-0 Brentford Fulham 1-4 Wolverhampton Plus let\u2019s not forget: Leicester City 1-2 Chelsea (at lunchtime) Manchester City v Tottenham (5pm) Bournemouth hit the bar with the last kick of the game! The ball drops to Semenyo, maybe 22 yards out, and his left-foot volley dips beyond Bert Verbruggen\u2019s flailing hand and into the meat of the crossbar! And that\u2019s it, Brighton win 2-1! Fulham push forward, trying to find a route back into this game, but it all ends with Wolves breaking, Guedes being played in on the right, and his low cross-shot beating Bernd Leno! Full time at Goodison Park, where Everton had 27 shots, five on target, and 10 corners, and no goals. Brentford escape with a point after being a player down for most of the match. Bournemouth pull one back, with a couple of stoppagetimely minutes to go. They work the ball snappily from left to right where Brooks takes a touch before toe-poking into the roof of the net. There\u2019s not much you can do about this kind of nonsense. It\u2019s just a brilliant first-time shot from Matheus Cunha, right on the edge of the area, which dips and curls into the far corner. Delicious stuff. That wraps it up for Arsenal! Two substitutes combine, Raheem Sterling running down the right and pulling back to Ethan Nwaneri, whose first-time shot beats Matt Sels at the near post. I have failed to bring you the starting line-ups for the evening game. But here they are now! Man City: Ederson, Walker, Stones, Akanji, Gvardiol, Lewis, Gundogan, Savio, Silva, Foden, Haaland. Subs: Ortega, Ake, Grealish, De Bruyne, Matheus Luiz, Wright, Simpson-Pusey, O\u2019Reilly, McAtee. Tottenham Hotspur: Vicario, Porro, Dragusin, Davies, Udogie, Bissouma, Sarr, Kulusevski, Maddison, Son, Solanke. Subs: Forster, Gray, Bergvall, Werner, Johnson, Spence, Lankshear, Olusesi, Hardy. Referee: John Brooks. Middlesbrough, you can stop scoring now. In their last three games they have scored four, and then five, and now six at Oxford United. They play Blackburn at home on Wednesday. Palace hit the post at Villa Park! That\u2019s a brilliant fingertip save from Emi Martinez. Not sure who the shot-taker might have been. Twenty-one shots for Everton so far today, which is already a season high. But only four on target, which is pretty ropey, and no goals. They have 12 minutes remaining against 10-man Brentford to make their numerical advantage count. A corner from the left, and Barkley rises highest at the near post to flick a header that goes in at the far! \u201cRegarding goals in the rain,\u201d writes Pip Minnithorpe, \u201cthis is the stuff.\u201d It is, indeed, the stuff. A message from our unofficial voluntary Scotland correspondent Simon McMahon! \u201cApparently the Dundee United team only arrived at Ibrox at 3 o\u2019clock and were expected to be ready to kick off at 3.45pm, before the match eventually got going 10 minutes later. Unsurprisingly United have hardly made it out of their own half in the opening stages. United manager Jim Goodwin was clear that there will be plenty of no excuses should United\u2019s dire recent record (no league win since 2011) at Ibrox continue.\u201d Dundee United have just taken the lead, though! Sam Dalby with the goal, in the 36th minute. On Soccer Saturday Mike Dean is raging about a decision not to send someone off for what he believes was a \u201c100% red card\u201d. If only I\u2019d been listening when he started talking I might be able to tell you who should have been sent off. Some people would consider this part of my job, but I just don\u2019t have infinite ears. A second yellow card for Carlos Baleba. I haven\u2019t seen the incident but universal reaction is that it was a very harsh decision. An email about modern drainage techniques! But bear with it. \u201cWatching the rain absolutely tip down at the Emirates I can\u2019t help but be impressed by modern drainage techniques,\u201d writes K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cHowever, I can\u2019t help but think something\u2019s been lost now that pitches are barely affected by weather conditions. Football used to be a bit like tennis, in that players had to adjust to different surfaces. I mean, sure, a team of superstars will play beautifully on a surface as smooth as a billiard table, but how about if a herd of cattle has stampeded through the stadium? That just isn\u2019t a factor anymore.\u201d I absolutely agree. I mean, what we have now is better, but also something has been lost. And also, watching footballers splash through standing puddles and the ball occasionally randomly and unexpectedly stop for no obvious reason is extremely entertaining. That is a nicely-worked goal, a couple of sharp passes outside the penalty area ending with Matheus Cunha picking out Joao Gomes, who shoots low and hard across goal and in! Well! Saka gets the assist this time, teasing for Forest defence down the right before pulling back to Partey, 20-something yards out. He takes a touch and then sends a dipping shot inside the far post! And a couple of minutes later Evanilson misses a great chance to get Bournemouth back in the game. The pull-back came to him quickly, and he scuffed it wide. A lovely pass from Joao Pedro finds Mitoma running in from the left, entirely unmarked, and he shoots first-time past Kepa and in at the far post. A quick VAR check, and the goal is approved. And we\u2019re back. Most games are about to kick off, or have just done so. Arsenal are bringing on Thomas Partey, but who\u2019s coming off? The fourth official fiddles extensively with his flashy number board thing, and it\u2019s Jorginho\u2019s No20. Forest do a halftimely substitution too, bringing Jota on for Elanga. Here are all the latest scores in the top four divisions of England\u2019s league pyramid and the top one of Scotland\u2019s (there\u2019s not much going on beyond that for weathery reasons) Premier League Arsenal 1-0 Nottingham Forest Aston Villa 1-2 Crystal Palace Bournemouth 0-1 Brighton Everton 0-0 Brentford Fulham 1-1 Wolverhampton Leicester City 1-2 Chelsea (final score) Manchester City v Tottenham (5pm) Championship Blackburn v Portsmouth (Postponed because of bad weather) Bristol City 0-1 Burnley (final score) Coventry 2-2 Sheff Utd (final score) Luton 1-0 Hull Millwall 0-1 Sunderland Oxford Utd 1-3 Middlesbrough Preston North End 1-1 Derby QPR 0-1 Stoke Sheff Wed 1-1 Cardiff (final score) West Brom 2-2 Norwich League One Barnsley 0-1 Wigan Bolton 2-1 Blackpool (final score) Burton Albion 0-2 Stockport County Crawley Town 1-0 Rotherham Huddersfield 1-1 Charlton Lincoln City 1-2 Wycombe Mansfield 0-0 Bristol Rovers Northampton 0-0 Cambridge Utd Peterborough 0-2 Reading Shrewsbury 3-2 Birmingham (final score) Stevenage 0-0 Leyton Orient (final score) Wrexham 2-0 Exeter League Two AFC Wimbledon 0-0 Walsall Bradford v Accrington Stanley (postponed because of bad weather) Carlisle 0-0 Doncaster Chesterfield 0-0 Barrow Fleetwood Town v Milton Keynes (postponed because of bad weather) Gillingham 0-0 Harrogate Town Grimsby 0-1 Colchester (final score) Notts County 0-0 Newport County (final score) Port Vale v Crewe Salford City v Bromley (postponed because of a waterlogged pitch) Swindon 1-2 Morecambe Scottish Premiership Dundee v Hibernian (5.45) Hearts v Celtic (7.45) Rangers 0-0 Dundee Utd (kick-off delayed by 55 minutes) Ross County 0-0 Motherwell St Johnstone 0-0 Kilmarnock St Mirren v Aberdeen (4pm) It is more or less half-time more or less everywhere. Score update incoming. At Millwall, Sunderland lead 1-0 but the players have been taken off the pitch because of a medical emergency in the crowd. They can you know! It\u2019s a lightning break, Sarr winning the header in his own penalty area and sprinting forward to collect a pass, speed down the right and pull back. It\u2019s just behind Mateta but it runs to Devenny, who doesn\u2019t miss! That\u2019s a very fine stop from Tielemans\u2019 penalty by Dean Henderson! Can Palace capitalise on that break? No goal for Bournemouth, Evanilson was indeed offside. But Aston Villa do have a penalty! A harsh decision, Will Hughes the culprit. In further VAR news, Aston Villa could be about to get a penalty and Bournemouth might have a disallowed goal reallowed. At Goodison Park, the referee is checking the VAR after Christian Norgaard catches Jordan Pickford in the knee, and he sees enough to wave red! Hasan emails with a complaint. \u201cFor the better part of a year I\u2019ve been waiting to make a pithy comment about Arsenal\u2019s Timber facing Forest\u2019s Wood, only for Nuno to pick today to start with Awoniyi instead,\u201d he sniffs. \u201cI\u2019m not impressed, but if we can heist a point from the Emirates today, all will be forgiven...\u201d Sadly flying to New Zealand every international break does make Wood less likely to play once he gets back again. You do not give Ollie Watkins that much space. His defender leaves him to close down McGinn, McGinn passes to Watkins before he gets there, and the striker ghosts past the keeper and passes into the net. That\u2019s a really great goal, a long-raking diagonal pass from inside the Wolves half and it lands on Cunha\u2019s toe as he runs into the penalty area. He brings it down beautifully and tucks it into the net, direct but perfect. At the Emirates Jesus doesn\u2019t notice Nicolas Dominguez creeping up on him as he dwells on the ball in midfield, and when he eventually tries to kick it he finds that it\u2019s already gone and he\u2019s kicked Dominguez instead. Yellow card. The linesman seems to be the busiest person in the Emirates Stadium this afternoon \u2013 I believe Arsenal have been caught offside five times already. Meanwhile another chance for Bournemouth, but this time the ball whistles wide. A decent chance for Evanilson to equalise for Bournemouth against Brighton, but his shot is saved. I\u2019d love to tell you something about this goal but I cannot. Fulham\u2019s official X suggests that \u201cour number 17 takes a touch and curls one into the far corner with his left foot!\u201d A great chance for Crystal Palace, who have a three-on-two break with Will Hughes on the ball and runners right and left. He probably picks the wrong one, rolling a pass to Sarr to his right, and his low shot from an unpromising angle is easily saved. Pick that one out of the net! Saka runs the ball along the edge of the area from right to left before lashing a shot back across the keeper and past his despairing flap! Everton are already 6-1 up on shots against Brentford, which suggests they aren\u2019t being at all boring. Still 0-0 on goals, though. It does not stand! Arsenal and Nottingham Forest remain tied at 0-0. A long hold-up at Arsenal while the VAR checks the offside. Califiori\u2019s goal could yet stand \u2026 Joao Pedro scores the first Premier League goal of the afternoon, burying the rebound after a decent low save. Then Ismael Sarr turns on the afterburner to outpace the defender before putting Palace ahead at Villa Park! And at the other end a pull-back runs to Hudson-Odoi, but he completely misses his kick. An early chance for Arsenal as Saka\u2019s shot falls to Trossard about six yards out, but his shot is saved. And then the whole thing ends with a defensive free-kick, Trossard having been given offside. BONG! The clock strikes three, and referees\u2019 whistles sound. Games on! Five minutes to kick-off, and players are in tunnels. \u201cFrom a strictly entertaiment perspective Bielsa ball is preferable to the Dyche siege mentality football,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cBut he has kept us up with his ultra conservative football. The diet is bland, but it helps us avoid a relegation heart attack.\u201d Well we\u2019ll see about that. Here, for absolutely no reason, is a picture of a dog who, perhaps unsurprisingly, wants to see Wolves. It\u2019s all over in Leicester, and Chelsea have bagged three points that take them from third in the table up to \u2026 er \u2026 still third in the table, but now closer to second. Leicester drop a place to 16th. Leicester have pulled a goal back against Chelsea, from the penalty spot. Jordan Ayew converted with four seconds of the five minutes\u2019 pre-advertised stoppage time remaining. \u201cA home defeat to Brentford is exactly the kind of result that appears on the record of a relegated club come May,\u201d notes Gary Naylor. \u201cSo does Sean Dyche adopt his signature caution to avoid that, or does he see the match as an opportunity to lift the team and the fans before the Christmas fixtures, and go expansive? Frankly, sneaking a 1-0 with a deflected Michael Keane header from an 88th-minute corner would do me right now. Though I suspect I\u2019m in a minority amongst Bluenoses.\u201d This is the only photograph I\u2019ve had through from Goodison Park today. I reckon that\u2019s an expansive smile. Actual snow! Storm Bert has dumped a bit of the white stuff on Glasgow, but the Ibrox pitch looks just dandy. Chelsea have doubled their lead at Leicester, with 12 minutes plus a bit of stoppage time to play.

This just in from PA Media: Storm Bert has wreaked havoc on the domestic football calendar, with Blackburn\u2019s Championship clash against Portsmouth one of a number of games called off. Bradford\u2019s League Two game against Accrington and Fleetwood\u2019s match with MK Dons have also become victims of the weather. In the National League, the derby between Rochdale and Oldham and Halifax\u2019s meeting with Sutton have also gone. Storm Bert has brought heavy rain and strong winds across the UK, with amber warnings for snow and ice in place for parts of Scotland and northern England. Blackburn called an 11am pitch inspection and a statement on their X feed said: \u201cDue to an unplayable pitch caused by torrential rain, today\u2019s match against Pompey at Ewood Park has been postponed by the match official.\u201d North of the border, Rangers\u2019 Ladbrokes Premiership clash with Dundee United was pushed back 45 minutes to allow the visitors extra time to travel to Ibrox with delays on the roads expected. The lower leagues in Scotland have been decimated by the weather, with only the Championship fixture between Ayr and Dunfermline, the League One clash between Montrose and Annan and East Fife\u2019s League Two trip to Edinburgh City surviving. Today\u2019s fixtures are an absolute triumph for first-half-of-the-alphabet top-flight home teams. Just look at that array of A to M action! Sure, this year\u2019s Premier League is 70% first-half-of-the-alphabet anyway, but today fully 85.7% of the 14 teams in action, and 100% of the sides playing at home, lounge triumphantly in the upper half of the alphabet table. Good old Guardian, you can rely on us to bring you all the key stats, can you not? And better still you can also rely on us to bring you all of the day\u2019s key goal updates, and between now and approximately 5pm GMT this will be the place to find them. Those fixtures, then, and hold on to your hats for some imminent team news: Ye Olde English Premier League Arsenal v Nottingham Forest Aston Villa v Crystal Palace Bournemouth v Brighton Everton v Brentford Fulham v Wolverhampton Leicester City v Chelsea (12.30) Manchester City v Tottenham (5pm) Championship Blackburn v Portsmouth (Postponed because of bad weather) Bristol City v Burnley (12.30) Coventry v Sheff Utd (12.30) Luton v Hull Millwall v Sunderland Oxford Utd v Middlesbrough Preston North End v Derby QPR v Stoke Sheff Wed v Cardiff (12.30pm) West Brom v Norwich League One Barnsley v Wigan Bolton v Blackpool (12.30) Burton Albion v Stockport County Crawley Town v Rotherham Huddersfield v Charlton Lincoln City v Wycombe Mansfield v Bristol Rovers Northampton v Cambridge Utd Peterborough v Reading Shrewsbury v Birmingham (12.30) Stevenage v Leyton Orient (12.30) Wrexham v Exeter League Two AFC Wimbledon v Walsall Bradford v Accrington Stanley (postponed because of bad weather) Carlisle v Doncaster Cheltenham v Tranmere Chesterfield v Barrow Fleetwood Town v Milton Keynes (postponed because of bad weather) Gillingham v Harrogate Town Grimsby v Colchester (12.30) Notts County v Newport County (12.30) Port Vale v Crewe Salford City v Bromley Swindon v Morecambe Scottish Premiership Dundee v Hibernian (5.45) Hearts v Celtic (7.45) Rangers v Dundee Utd (3.30pm) Ross County v Motherwell St Johnstone v Kilmarnock St Mirren v Aberdeen",

Jean-Philippe Mateta often looked like a man playing against boys with his strength, speed and ability to hold on to the ball as claret and blue shirts bounced off him. He created the first goal within four minutes, slicing open Villa with a pass for the lightning quick Sarr to chase, while holding off Ian&nbsp;Maatsen, before calmly slotting beyond Emiliano Mart\u00ednez to silence all but a corner of Villa Park.</p> \n<p>The pattern of the game was already set as Villa lacked the speed of thought and confidence that helped them qualify for the Champions League last season. It was a real moment of quality, though, that brought them back into the match. John McGinn spotted a trademark Watkins run, weighting the pass perfectly to tease Dean Henderson out of his goal, thinking he could get there first only to be beaten to it by the striker, who rounded the goalkeeper to score his&nbsp;first in six matches for Villa.</p> \n<p>The equaliser energised Villa and Leon Bailey soon rattled the crossbar as they looked to complete the turnaround.

      "bodyText": "When Aston Villa last lost five matches in a row, Dean Smith paid with his job. The situation was not as severe for Unai Emery but he needed to end a dismal run of four defeats and was deeply frustrated that his side failed to turn domination into three points. Ollie Watkins and Ross Barkley twice equalised for Aston Villa, who also had a Youri Tielemans penalty saved. They were twice hit on the break, resulting in Isma\u00efla Sarr and Justin Devenny giving Palace the lead. Villa were dominant from the start but lacked the cutting edge expected of a Champions League side. \u201cWe are making mistakes and teams are scoring so we are not getting the points we deserve,\u201d Emery said. \u201cThere is still work to do. We are really convinced this is the way to play but we are not getting three points \u2013 we deserve, more or less, to win each match at home.\u201d Oliver Glasner set up his side to play on the break and it was highly effective. Jean-Philippe Mateta often looked like a man playing against boys with his strength, speed and ability to hold on to the ball as claret and blue shirts bounced off him. He created the first goal within four minutes, slicing open Villa with a pass for the lightning quick Sarr to chase, while holding off Ian Maatsen, before calmly slotting beyond Emiliano Mart\u00ednez to silence all but a corner of Villa Park. The pattern of the game was already set as Villa lacked the speed of thought and confidence that helped them qualify for the Champions League last season. It was a real moment of quality, though, that brought them back into the match. John McGinn spotted a trademark Watkins run, weighting the pass perfectly to tease Dean Henderson out of his goal, thinking he could get there first only to be beaten to it by the striker, who rounded the goalkeeper to score his first in six matches for Villa. The equaliser energised Villa and Leon Bailey soon rattled the crossbar as they looked to complete the turnaround. Bailey was the protagonist for the penalty as Will Hughes stepped on his ankle inside the box. The referee Tim Robinson gave nothing but was sent over to the screen by his colleagues. It seemed harsh to overturn the original decision and Hughes looked at the replay on the big screen with a confused smile. There was a wider grin when Henderson dived superbly to his left to palm away Tielemans\u2019 spot-kick. Henderson was celebrating in front of the away end almost immediately when Palace broke from the resulting corner and the 21-year-old Devenny swept home his first goal for the club on his second appearance after a flowing move from back to front. Villa had 70% of possession but managed to get only five of their 17 shots on target against a battling Palace. The hosts were often quite ponderous, struggling to find the right pass to open up a disciplined Eagles defence and needed a set piece to secure a draw. The visitors had their backs against the wall through the second half with 11 men consistently behind the ball as they aimed to hold on for victory. It seemed inevitable Palace would fail to leave with the points and it was Barkley who made the most of being unmarked to flick in from a Tielemans corner.

      "body": "<p>Trouble is at Sean Dyche\u2019s door just as the Friedkin Group waits to walk in as Everton\u2019s new owner. The manager was left in no doubt as to the growing discontent inside Goodison Park after Brentford claimed their first away point of the season despite playing with 10 men for 53 minutes. They did so in relative comfort, which says everything about the paucity of Everton\u2019s attacking game.</p> \n<p>Brentford\u2019s captain, Christian N\u00f8rgaard, was shown a red card in the 41st minute for catching Jordan Pickford\u2019s knee with his studs. Thomas Frank confirmed his club will likely appeal against the decision. The Brentford manager was incensed at the time but a first Premier League clean sheet of the season, and in these circumstances, lifted his mood.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/nov/23/arsenal-v-nottingham-forest-premier-league-updates-and-more-football-live\">Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest, Premier League updates and more: football \u2013 live</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Goodison\u2019s darkened in step with an increasingly clueless display from an Everton team that performed better against 11 men. It is now five draws in eight league games for them and no goals in three outings. An ominous December \u2013 which includes games against all of the top four, Ruben Amorim\u2019s first home league game as Manchester United manager, a revitalised Wolves and Nottingham Forest \u2013 awaits.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey can direct it at whoever they want,\u201d said Dyche of the boos that greeted the small mercy of the final whistle. \u201cThey expect us to win. I expect us to win. It\u2019s our responsibility and my responsibility to make sure we do better than we did today. We have to find killer moments more often and we didn\u2019t. It\u2019s been a longstanding thing here. Most managers can change it by chequebook. We can\u2019t do that, so the development continues.\u201d</p> \n<p>Brentford had 16 points before kick-off \u2013 all won at the Gtech Stadium. Their impressive home form was in stark contrast to results on the road and Frank\u2019s team were immediately on the back foot. Everton had enough pressure and openings to have capitalised before the break. Not for the first time in Dyche\u2019s reign, a lack of ruthlessness and quality in the final third prevented them from doing so. Mark Flekken in the Brentford goal proved another obstacle.</p> \n<p>Flekken produced a superb reflex save to prevent Dominic Calvert-Lewin giving Everton an early lead when flicking on Idrissa Gueye\u2019s low volley. Iliman Ndiaye and Dwight McNeil also had decent opportunities, three times in the case of the latter, before Flekken denied Calvert-Lewin again when the striker was played in behind the defence.</p> \n<p>Everton\u2019s continuing search for a killer touch left Goodison with a familiar sense of foreboding. Brentford looked to take advantage and Pickford made an important block to prevent Yoane Wissa scoring from Mikkel Damsgaard\u2019s fine through-ball.</p> \n<p>The visitors\u2019 performance was improving when an intervention by the video assistant referee left them down to 10 men. It appeared a harsh red for N\u00f8rgaard at first glance. He and Wissa attempted to play the ball when Ethan Pinnock\u2019s header sailed across the Everton area towards the unmarked pair. Neither connected, when they might have scored, but N\u00f8rgaard\u2019s raised studs embedded themselves into Pickford\u2019s right knee when the Everton keeper spread himself to save. The midfielder went in high and made no attempt to avoid Pickford\u2019s knee.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you\u2019re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Chris Kavanagh, sent to the pitch-side screen, showed a red card for serious foul play. The incident was shown on the giant TV screens, causing uproar among the Brentford support. Frank also joined the \u00adprotests and received a yellow card for his mounting troubles.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was not a red card,\u201d the Brentford manager insisted. \u201cChristian\u2019s eyes are clearly on the ball.

      "bodyText": "Trouble is at Sean Dyche\u2019s door just as the Friedkin Group waits to walk in as Everton\u2019s new owner. The manager was left in no doubt as to the growing discontent inside Goodison Park after Brentford claimed their first away point of the season despite playing with 10 men for 53 minutes. They did so in relative comfort, which says everything about the paucity of Everton\u2019s attacking game. Brentford\u2019s captain, Christian N\u00f8rgaard, was shown a red card in the 41st minute for catching Jordan Pickford\u2019s knee with his studs. Thomas Frank confirmed his club will likely appeal against the decision. The Brentford manager was incensed at the time but a first Premier League clean sheet of the season, and in these circumstances, lifted his mood. Goodison\u2019s darkened in step with an increasingly clueless display from an Everton team that performed better against 11 men. It is now five draws in eight league games for them and no goals in three outings. An ominous December \u2013 which includes games against all of the top four, Ruben Amorim\u2019s first home league game as Manchester United manager, a revitalised Wolves and Nottingham Forest \u2013 awaits. \u201cThey can direct it at whoever they want,\u201d said Dyche of the boos that greeted the small mercy of the final whistle. \u201cThey expect us to win. I expect us to win. It\u2019s our responsibility and my responsibility to make sure we do better than we did today. We have to find killer moments more often and we didn\u2019t. It\u2019s been a longstanding thing here. Most managers can change it by chequebook. We can\u2019t do that, so the development continues.\u201d Brentford had 16 points before kick-off \u2013 all won at the Gtech Stadium. Their impressive home form was in stark contrast to results on the road and Frank\u2019s team were immediately on the back foot. Everton had enough pressure and openings to have capitalised before the break. Not for the first time in Dyche\u2019s reign, a lack of ruthlessness and quality in the final third prevented them from doing so. Mark Flekken in the Brentford goal proved another obstacle. Flekken produced a superb reflex save to prevent Dominic Calvert-Lewin giving Everton an early lead when flicking on Idrissa Gueye\u2019s low volley. Iliman Ndiaye and Dwight McNeil also had decent opportunities, three times in the case of the latter, before Flekken denied Calvert-Lewin again when the striker was played in behind the defence. Everton\u2019s continuing search for a killer touch left Goodison with a familiar sense of foreboding. Brentford looked to take advantage and Pickford made an important block to prevent Yoane Wissa scoring from Mikkel Damsgaard\u2019s fine through-ball. The visitors\u2019 performance was improving when an intervention by the video assistant referee left them down to 10 men. It appeared a harsh red for N\u00f8rgaard at first glance. He and Wissa attempted to play the ball when Ethan Pinnock\u2019s header sailed across the Everton area towards the unmarked pair. Neither connected, when they might have scored, but N\u00f8rgaard\u2019s raised studs embedded themselves into Pickford\u2019s right knee when the Everton keeper spread himself to save. The midfielder went in high and made no attempt to avoid Pickford\u2019s knee. Chris Kavanagh, sent to the pitch-side screen, showed a red card for serious foul play. The incident was shown on the giant TV screens, causing uproar among the Brentford support. Frank also joined the protests and received a yellow card for his mounting troubles. \u201cIt was not a red card,\u201d the Brentford manager insisted. \u201cChristian\u2019s eyes are clearly on the ball. There is no force, no intention to hurt Pickford. If the law says that is a red then the law has changed. I will have to tell my players they can\u2019t jump in and try to score in the six-yard box.\u201d Everton toiled against the 10 men and were almost punished on the counterattack by Keane Lewis-Potter. Pickford saved his low shot and Mathias Jensen was unable to convert the loose ball from 18 yards out. Vitalii Mykolenko should have broken the deadlock but skied over from Ndiaye\u2019s pass. Beto, on as a late rescue act substitute again, might have won it in stoppage time but for a vital block by Pinnock. Brentford were soon celebrating a deserved point in front of their jubilant fans.

Magritte\u2019s most deadpan tease, which depicts a pipe above a caption advising that \u201cThis is not a pipe\u201d, was painted in 1929 but didn\u2019t sell until 1954. Meanwhile he kept busy as a commercial artist, designing wallpaper or ads for cigarettes; during the Nazi occupation of Belgium, he amateurishly <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/magritte-master-forger-2431391\">forged Titians and Renoirs</a>.</p> <p>Conformity was his mode of subversion. By contrast with the exhibitionism of Dal\u00ec or the roguery of Picasso, he camouflaged himself as a bourgeois provincial, wore a tie when painting, and used his kitchen or a corner of his living room as a studio.

It is the \u201ccamera obscura\u201d of Magritte\u2019s imagination, and the beaming blue sky that coexists with nocturnal gloom suggests the way that ideas generate a strange radiance inside a shuttered head and mysteriously glow behind the sealed windows.</p> <p>More precisely, it\u2019s a homage to cinema. Magritte was an ardent film fan, whose enthusiasm is commemorated in the name given to the prizes for cinematic achievement awarded by the Acad\u00e9mie Andr\u00e9 Delvaux: America has its Oscars, France its C\u00e9sars, but Belgium gives out Magrittes \u2013 witty glass facsimiles of the carved balustrades that drift into his deceptively bland, flat canvases, detached from any useful architectural purpose.</p> <p><em>Empire of Light</em> reflects the chiaroscuro of cinema, where phantasms of light are projected through the darkness and people dream with their eyes wide open; maybe it also alludes to what French film-makers call <em>la nuit am\u00e9ricaine</em>, the practice of using special lenses and filters to shoot night scenes in broad daylight.

A few small adjustments can make <em>Empire of Light</em> betray its secret, and in 1973 the painting was rearranged on the poster for <em>The Exorcist</em>, William Friedkin\u2019s movie about the devil\u2019s obscene ravaging of an adolescent girl in Washington. The design retains Magritte\u2019s street lamp and lighted windows, but makes them glare more acidly; reducing the trees to shrubs, it introduces a figure - the priest arriving for a house call that ends in his death - who rightly hesitates at the entrance.

Many in Britain, Labour and Tories, share American concerns. A House of Commons Library <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10029/\">briefing in July</a> traced a \u201csharp deterioration\u201d in China ties in recent years, pointing in particular to Beijing\u2019s \u201cexpansive\u201d foreign policy and cyber-attacks and espionage in the UK. It noted Britain formally deems China a \u201csystemic competitor\u201d and \u201cthe greatest state-based threat to the UK\u2019s economic security\u201d.</p> <p>Speaking in Rio, Xi was adamant that his stance on Taiwan, democracy and other core issues would not change. But he also offered reassurance with a smiley face, stressing that he sought \u201cstable, healthy and sustainable\u201d relations with the west \u2013 words that, like Starmer\u2019s, may have been partly aimed at Trump.</p> <p>Very deep differences remain. But Chinese and UK geostrategic interests may actually be converging in the face of Trump\u2019s prospectively disruptive, costly, dangerous return. Climate change and post-pandemic health are two key areas of cooperation. Ongoing confrontation between the world\u2019s top two economic and military powers would not be to Britain\u2019s advantage. If Trump, the disquieting American, cannot be befriended and influenced, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/us/politics/trump-world-leaders-china-xi-stability.html\">perhaps Xi can</a>? </p> <p>Other countries are making similar calculations. Germany, with its huge Chinese exports, wants to keep things friendly. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/12/china-must-face-higher-cost-for-backing-russia-says-next-eu-foreign-policy-chief\">EU prefers</a> \u201cde-risking\u201d to open, Trump-like ruptures, though it is divided and inconsistent. Hungary and Greece hold <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/12/china-must-face-higher-cost-for-backing-russia-says-next-eu-foreign-policy-chief\">China close</a>, Lithuania feuds. Europe as a whole would suffer greatly in any US-initiated global tariff war.</p> <p>Emmanuel Macron was another leader making nice with Xi in Rio. France\u2019s president raised China\u2019s support for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, then claimed, mysteriously, to have achieved a \u201cconvergence of views\u201d. Distancing himself from Trump, Macron said <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20241119-macron-tells-xi-he-shares-desire-for-durable-peace-in-ukraine\">France would continue</a> to promote European strategic autonomy, \u201cprecisely to be able to talk with China in complete independence\u201d.</p> <p>Not to be left out, Anthony Albanese, Australia\u2019s prime minister, set aside thorny bilateral disputes and, like Starmer, shook hands with Xi on a new start. Australia, too, valued steady \u201ccalibrated\u201d ties. Trade was flourishing again, Albanese said. \u201cDialogue is critical, and we\u2019ve made encouraging progress.\u201d Jolly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2024/nov/19/xi-jinping-pleased-with-positive-momentum-of-china-australia-relations-video\">Xi hugged him</a> right back (figuratively speaking). </p> <p>All this must be music to Xi\u2019s ears. He has long dreamed of China supplanting the US as the 21st century\u2019s foremost superpower. Beset by economic problems and a \u201c<a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2023/09/the-rise-and-fall-of-chinas-wolf-warrior-diplomacy/\">wolf warrior diplomacy</a>\u201d backlash, he has launched a foreign charm offensive. Last month, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckg0gwy0nlyo\">he patched up</a> a festering Himalayan border dispute with India, an old rival wooed by the US.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s victory was initially assessed as bad news for China. It may be the exact opposite. He\u2019s unpredictable. His views change. But if \u201cAmerica first\u201d means putting everyone else last, if Trump\u2019s isolationism, aggressive nationalism and trade war threats end up screwing America\u2019s allies, then those allies, including Starmer, may ultimately swallow their misgivings and look elsewhere for reliable friends \u2013 if only to achieve some balance. If Xi\u2019s dream of dominance comes true, he will know who to thank. Donald Trump: Making China Great Again.</p> <p>\u2022 Simon Tisdall is the Observer\u2019s Foreign Affairs Commentator</p>",

These men constitute what the New York Times calls \u201ca new class of cold warrior, guns pointed at China\u201d. And, like Trump, they will be unimpressed by Starmer\u2019s cosying up to Xi. Starmer surely knows that, which makes his repositioning all the more interesting. Many in Britain, Labour and Tories, share American concerns. A House of Commons Library briefing in July traced a \u201csharp deterioration\u201d in China ties in recent years, pointing in particular to Beijing\u2019s \u201cexpansive\u201d foreign policy and cyber-attacks and espionage in the UK. It noted Britain formally deems China a \u201csystemic competitor\u201d and \u201cthe greatest state-based threat to the UK\u2019s economic security\u201d. Speaking in Rio, Xi was adamant that his stance on Taiwan, democracy and other core issues would not change. But he also offered reassurance with a smiley face, stressing that he sought \u201cstable, healthy and sustainable\u201d relations with the west \u2013 words that, like Starmer\u2019s, may have been partly aimed at Trump. Very deep differences remain. But Chinese and UK geostrategic interests may actually be converging in the face of Trump\u2019s prospectively disruptive, costly, dangerous return. Climate change and post-pandemic health are two key areas of cooperation. Ongoing confrontation between the world\u2019s top two economic and military powers would not be to Britain\u2019s advantage. If Trump, the disquieting American, cannot be befriended and influenced, perhaps Xi can? Other countries are making similar calculations. Germany, with its huge Chinese exports, wants to keep things friendly. The EU prefers \u201cde-risking\u201d to open, Trump-like ruptures, though it is divided and inconsistent. Hungary and Greece hold China close, Lithuania feuds. Europe as a whole would suffer greatly in any US-initiated global tariff war. Emmanuel Macron was another leader making nice with Xi in Rio. France\u2019s president raised China\u2019s support for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, then claimed, mysteriously, to have achieved a \u201cconvergence of views\u201d. Distancing himself from Trump, Macron said France would continue to promote European strategic autonomy, \u201cprecisely to be able to talk with China in complete independence\u201d. Not to be left out, Anthony Albanese, Australia\u2019s prime minister, set aside thorny bilateral disputes and, like Starmer, shook hands with Xi on a new start. Australia, too, valued steady \u201ccalibrated\u201d ties. Trade was flourishing again, Albanese said. \u201cDialogue is critical, and we\u2019ve made encouraging progress.\u201d Jolly Xi hugged him right back (figuratively speaking). All this must be music to Xi\u2019s ears. He has long dreamed of China supplanting the US as the 21st century\u2019s foremost superpower. Beset by economic problems and a \u201cwolf warrior diplomacy\u201d backlash, he has launched a foreign charm offensive. Last month, he patched up a festering Himalayan border dispute with India, an old rival wooed by the US. Trump\u2019s victory was initially assessed as bad news for China. It may be the exact opposite. He\u2019s unpredictable. His views change. But if \u201cAmerica first\u201d means putting everyone else last, if Trump\u2019s isolationism, aggressive nationalism and trade war threats end up screwing America\u2019s allies, then those allies, including Starmer, may ultimately swallow their misgivings and look elsewhere for reliable friends \u2013 if only to achieve some balance. If Xi\u2019s dream of dominance comes true, he will know who to thank. Donald Trump: Making China Great Again. \u2022 Simon Tisdall is the Observer\u2019s Foreign Affairs Commentator",

But episode two of <em>Stakeknife</em> is an exceptional piece of audio documentary \u2013 riveting and sad \u2013 and it should be acknowledged.</p> <p>Here, we join journalist Mark Horgan and Belfast man S\u00e9amus Kearney, who are visiting Kearney\u2019s childhood home. Kearney is an ex-IRA volunteer,recruited in his teens. Gradually we hear of his younger brother, Michael, who, unlike S\u00e9amus, wasn\u2019t bothered about politics: \u201cHe was more interested in going to the dances and he loved old cars,\u201d says S\u00e9amus. S\u00e9amus was hugely surprised when Michael joined the IRA; Michael signed up because, in 1977, S\u00e9amus was sentenced to 14 years for conspiracy to murder and was part of the H block blanket protests. \u201cIt was the H block thing,\u201d says Seamus, about Michael\u2019s involvement. \u201cI felt guilty, I\u2019ll always feel guilty.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>S\u00e9amus had actually met his brother\u2019s killer: a gunman who had no idea who he was murdering, who was just \u2018doing his job\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 1979, Michael is picked up and interrogated by the RUC. He\u2019s physically abused for three days and gives them a tiny detail about where a small stash of waterlogged explosives are situated. When he\u2019s freed he goes to his IRA commander and tells him everything. The information Michael\u2019s handed over is useless, yet he\u2019s taken by the IRA to a place near the Irish border and kept there for 17 days. His body is found on 12 July 1979. Deemed an informer, he\u2019s been shot twice in the back of the head.</p> <p>S\u00e9amus and Horgan visit the spot where Michael\u2019s body was found, which S\u00e9amus has not previously visited. He prays at the site of his brother\u2019s death. He cries. Earlier, he told Horgan that he\u2019d actually met his brother\u2019s killer: a gunman who had no idea who he was murdering, who was just \u201cdoing his job\u201d. How did S\u00e9amus feel about this, wonders Horgan. There\u2019s a pause.</p> <p>\u201cI worked within a context, so did he,\u201d says S\u00e9amus. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to explain that. If you step out of the military context you may as well just hang yourself\u2026 You can\u2019t live with it, there\u2019s no point living.\u201d His small speech is chilling, moving and incredibly upsetting, all at the same time.</p> <p>Context, context. Within the so-called Troubles there\u2019s always context. The person who ordered Michael\u2019s death was Freddie Scappaticci, who at the time was the head of the IRA\u2019s internal security unit, which was dedicated to rooting out \u201ctouts\u201d (informers).

      "bodyText": "The international criminal court\u2019s decision to issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders over the war in Gaza has been welcomed by Palestinians as a landmark moment in their decade-long fight to challenge the Israeli occupation through international institutions. Thursday\u2019s announcement from the international criminal court\u2019s pretrial chamber of arrest warrants for Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has sent shockwaves through the international legal system. As the first time that officials from a democratic, western-allied state have been charged with war crimes, it is widely seen as the most significant action taken by the court since it was set up at the turn of the century. \u201cWe had no illusions about how tough this road was going to be. Every step leading to this moment was difficult, but Palestine stayed the course,\u201d said Ammar Hijazi, who leads the Palestinian Authority\u2019s delegation to The Hague, the seat of the ICC. \u201cWe told the world justice for Palestine will be the litmus test of the international system; we were not being hyperbolic.\u201d Diana Buttu, a human rights lawyer and former Palestinian peace negotiator, said: \u201cThe days ahead for Palestine are not good \u2026 At the same time, Israel will struggle to remove the stain of these warrants. When countries like Canada and the Netherlands say they will implement the court\u2019s decision, it calls weapons sales and the level of political support for Israel into question.\u201d The ICC\u2019s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, announced in May his office would seek arrest warrants for the two Israelis, as well as Hamas leaders Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif, for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Haniyeh and Sinwar have since been killed. The ICC also issued an arrest warrant for Deif, who is believed to have died in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza in July, although Hamas has not officially confirmed his death. In an extraordinary rebuke of Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians and its conduct in the war in Gaza, the chamber ruled there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Gallant bore criminal responsibility as co-perpetrators for \u201cthe war crime of starvation as a method of warfare and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts\u201d. The warrants severely curtail the Israeli officials\u2019 ability to travel abroad, since the ICC\u2019s 124 member states would be obliged to arrest them, further deepening the country\u2019s growing international isolation. The move presents fresh challenges for Israel\u2019s western allies, which are struggling to reconcile support for the Jewish state with evidence of war crimes in the conflict and respect for the rules-based order. Member states of the ICC now have a choice between \u201cinternational law and accountability for all or none at all\u201d, Hijazi said. \u201cThey can\u2019t pretend that the system has relevance and works if they give Israel a free pass. If states that have declared their compliance with and respect for the court match their words with actions, Israel will feel the impact on many fronts.\u201d Israel is not a member of the ICC and denies committing war crimes in the war in Gaza sparked by Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel in October 2023. Many in Israel have long maintained that the UN and associated bodies such as the ICC are biased against it. Palestine was recognised as a member of the court in 2015. The Guardian revealed in May how Israel ran a nine-year-long secret \u201cwar\u201d against the court, deploying its intelligence agencies to surveil, hack, smear and allegedly threaten senior ICC staff in an effort to derail the court\u2019s inquiries. Earlier this year, after the court\u2019s chief prosecutor applied for arrest warrants, Palestinian civil society hoped the growing threat of prosecution might have had a deterrent effect on Israel\u2019s actions. Instead, the country reacted by announcing new settlements in the occupied West Bank, which were described as a punitive measure for Palestinian cooperation with the court. Israel also stepped up its military campaign on Rafah, the southernmost town in the Gaza Strip, which at that point was the last place of relative safety for civilians in the Palestinian territory. \u201cPalestinian civil society has been working towards this moment since 2009; the fact that it has taken this long is an indictment of the international system. Eight thousand people have died in Gaza since [warrants were sought]. Maybe those lives could have been saved,\u201d Buttu said.

UK power officials have warned that the worst of Storm Bert is still to come. While our liveblog on Storm Bert will be closing shortly, you can get our latest news stories on the UK weather here. These are the key events and alerts covered in the blog today: Tens of thousands of homes have been without power, with 4,000 homes affected in the Midlands, south-west England and south Wales and 27,000 customers affected in the north-east, Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire. While in Ireland, the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) said that high winds had caused power outages for 60,000 customers, with the worst affected counties including Donegal, Sligo, Mayo, Galway, Cavan, Monaghan, Kerry and Cork. Flights were disrupted at Newcastle airport as heavy snow hit the north-east overnight and into Saturday morning. Some arrivals were diverted to Belfast and Edinburgh while the airport\u2019s snow team tried to minimise disruption. Scots are being urged not to travel \u201cunless absolutely necessary\u201d. Forecasters have predicted as much as 40cm of snow on high grounds in Scotland. Emergency services closed junctions 13 and 14 of the M74 following a crash at around 7am. Traffic Scotland has warned of \u201cextremely poor driving conditions\u201d in the area. The Met Office issued an amber warning for snow and ice for parts of Scotland and northern England, with a \u201cgood chance some rural communities could be cut off\u201d. Amber warnings mean there is the potential for risk to life and property. The strongest gust so far during Storm Bert was 82mph recorded in Capel Curig, north Wales, according to the Met Office. The next highest on Saturday was 76mph in The Needles, off of the Isle of Wight, followed by 69mph in Berry Head, Devon. National Highways issued a \u201csevere weather alert\u201d on Saturday for snow affecting Yorkshire and north-east England with \u201cblizzard conditions\u201d expected and up to five hours of heavy snow set to \u201caccumulate quickly at all levels\u201d. According to the Met Office, 13cm of snow fell in some parts of the UK on Saturday morning. More than 100 flood alerts are in place across the UK. The Environment Agency (EA) has issued more than a dozen red warnings meaning flooding is expected in the north-west of England, including for the M61 between Manchester and Preston. The Met Office forecasts heavy rain developing overnight and into Sunday for south-west and southern England, stretching from Oxford to Truro. The yellow warning is in place from 6am on Saturday until 11.45pm on Sunday and up to 70mm of rain could fall during this time. There is a chance that some places over Dartmoor could see 100-150mm of rainfall, the national weather service said. Strong winds are set to cause \u201cdangerous coastal conditions\u201d, the Met Office said, and a yellow wind warning is in place until 9pm on Sunday for southern England and parts of Wales. A man in his 60s has died after a tree fell on a car on the A34 near Winchester, Hampshire police said. It is unclear if the incident was related to Storm Bert but the cause is under investigation. The force was called at 7.47am to the southbound carriageway between Kings Worthy and Winnall and found the driver of a black Mercedes E350 dead at the scene. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) has issued a series of flood warnings and alerts across the country, as bridges are shut and roads closed. Over the weekend, Wales is expected to face up to 75mm of rain widely, with 150 mm possible in some areas. Gusts of 70mph are expected to hit coastal areas. A yellow alert for wind and rain warnings was in place for most counties in Ireland until midday on Saturday, but another status yellow warning will kick in from 5pm until 2am on Sunday for six counties: Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford and Wicklow. Bridge Street in Killybegs, County Donegal, has been badly flooded after the storm and flooding incidents have also been reported in Galway, Limerick and Cork. In Northern Ireland, a yellow alert for rain and snow was in place across the region from midnight until 11am on Saturday, while a wind warning is in place until Saturday evening. Police urged motorists to take extra care on a number of roads in the Newtownards area because of the impact of poor weather conditions on Saturday. It said that a fallen tree on the Belfast Road and on the Springvale Road, between Ballyhalbert and Ballywalter, had blocked both lanes. Queensferry Crossing across the Firth of Forth in Scotland has been closed as a safety precaution due to Storm Bert. The decision to close the crossing at 10.20am on Saturday was made after ice was observed falling from the bridge\u2019s stay cables above the carriageway. Lothian Buses, one of Scotland\u2019s biggest bus firms paused its services due to the impact of the storm, while numerous train services were cancelled or delayed. Ferry operator DFDS cancelled services on some routes until Monday with sailings from Newhaven to Dieppe and Dover to Calais being severely affected. The M48 Severn Bridge in Gloucestershire is closed in both directions between J1 and J2 due to strong winds and National Highways has advised motorists to use the M4 Prince of Wales Bridge. Avanti West Coast, which runs the west coast mainline services, has cancelled its services north of Preston all day. UK Power Networks, the operator for the east and south-east of England, has warned people to stay away from overhead power lines amid the gusts. Storm Bert wreaked havoc on the domestic football calendar with Blackburn\u2019s Championship clash against Portsmouth one of a number of games called off. Tens of thousands of homes have been without power, with 4,000 homes affected in the Midlands, south-west England and south Wales and 27,000 customers affected in the north-east, Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire, reports the PA news agency. Ross Easton, of Energy Networks Association (ENA) \u2013 which represents the UK\u2019s power network operators, said: There are a few localised weather-related power cuts in parts of Britain this morning. However, for most parts of the country the severe weather hasn\u2019t yet had a significant impact. Forecasters are describing this as a \u2018multi-hazard event\u2019 with the worst of the weather yet to arrive, and so our members have extra engineers and contact centre teams available, and control rooms are monitoring the storm closely as it develops.\u201d More than 100 flood alerts are in place across the UK. The Environment Agency (EA) has issued more than a dozen red warnings meaning flooding is expected in the north-west of England, including for the M61 between Manchester and Preston. The Met Office forecasts heavy rain developing overnight and into Sunday for south-west and southern England, stretching from Oxford to Truro. The yellow warning is in place from 6am on Saturday until 11.45pm on Sunday and up to 70mm of rain could fall during this time. There is a chance that some places over Dartmoor could see 100-150mm of rainfall, the national weather service said. Strong winds are set to cause \u201cdangerous coastal conditions\u201d, the Met Office said, and a yellow wind warning is in place until 9pm on Sunday for southern England and parts of Wales. Homeowners are facing flooding as Storm Bert continues to batter Wales, bringing rain, winds and rising waters, reports the PA news agency. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) has issued a series of flood warnings and alerts across the country, as bridges are shut and roads closed. Over the weekend, Wales is expected to face up to 75mm of rain widely, with 150 mm possible in some areas. Gusts of 70mph are expected to hit coastal areas. The Met Office has warned heavy rain is likely to cause travel disruption and flooding, particularly across south Wales. NRW has issued flood warnings \u2013 where flooding is expected, and immediate action is required \u2013 on five stretches of river. It has also issued alerts \u2013 where flooding is possible \u2013 for more than 30 areas across Wales. Warnings are in place around: River Loughor at Ammanford and Llandybie affecting low-lying property in Ammanford, Llandybie and Aberlash, including Carmarthenshire college. River Severn, affecting the village of Aberbechan. River Severn, affecting parts of the village of Abermule. River Cothi in low lying areas between Pontargothi and Pontynyswen, including the Cothi Bridge hotel. River Towy, affecting isolated properties, as well as farms and roads, between Llandeilo and Abbergwili. The roads have also seen massive disruption, with the M48 Severn Bridge between Monmouthshire and Gloucestershire closed in both directions between J1 and J2 due to strong winds. National Highways has advised motorists to use the M4 Prince of Wales Bridge, leading to around four miles of congestion on the M4 west of J20-22. The PA news agency reports that rail lines have also been affected, with the Conwy Valley line, which runs from Llandudno to Blaenau Ffestiniog, and the Heart of Wales lines \u2013 Swansea to Shropshire \u2013 set to be closed all Saturday and Sunday. Irish Ferries\u2019 crossings between Pembroke Dock and Rosslare and Stena Line\u2019s services between Fishguard and Rosslare have been cancelled. Wind gusts of 82mph have been recordered in Capel Curig, Wales, says the Met Office. In a post on X, the Met Office shared an update of the strongest Storm Bert wind gusts so far. After the 82mph recorded in Capel Curig, the next highest was 76mph in The Needles, off of the Isle of Wight, followed by 69mph in Berry Head, Devon. St Bees Head in Cumbria recorded 68mph wind gusts, while Tiree in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland and Brizlee Wood near Alnwick had gusts of 67mph, according to the Met Office. A man in his 60s has died after a tree fell on a car on the A34 near Winchester, Hampshire police said. It is unclear if the incident was related to Storm Bert but the cause is under investigation, reports the PA news agency. The force was called at 7.47am to the southbound carriageway between Kings Worthy and Winnall and found the driver of a black Mercedes E350 dead at the scene. A silver Skoda Kodiaq was also damaged but no other injuries were reported. Hampshire police said the man\u2019s family has been informed. Lengthy lane closures have been put in place and the force is appealing for anyone with information to come forward, particularly anyone with relevant dashcam footage. Storm Bert has wreaked havoc on the domestic football calendar with Blackburn\u2019s Championship clash against Portsmouth one of a number of games called off. Bradford\u2019s League Two game against Accrington and Fleetwood\u2019s match with MK Dons have also been called off, reports the PA news agency. In the National League, the derby between Rochdale and Oldham and Halifax\u2019s meeting with Sutton have also gone. Blackburn called an 11am pitch inspection and a statement on their X feed said: Due to an unplayable pitch caused by torrential rain, today\u2019s match against Pompey at Ewood Park has been postponed by the match official.\u201d In Scotland, Rangers\u2019 William Hill Premiership clash with Dundee United was pushed back by 45 minutes to allow the visitors extra time to travel to Ibrox with delays on the roads expected. Morton\u2019s Championship game with Partick Thistle failed a morning pitch inspection and Airdrie\u2019s clash with Livingston was also called off. In League One, the games between Kelty Hearts and Arbroath, Cove Rangers and Stenhousemuir, Alloa and Dumbarton, and Queen of the South and Inverness were all called off with only the Montrose and Annan Athletic fixture surviving. The League Two match between Bonnyrigg Rose and Stirling Albion plus Stranraer\u2019s trip to Spartans were also postponed, according to the PA news agency. A yellow alert for wind and rain warnings was in place for most counties in Ireland until midday on Saturday, but another status yellow warning will kick in from 5pm until 2am on Sunday for six counties: Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford and Wicklow, reports the PA news agency. Bridge Street in Killybegs, County Donegal, has been badly flooded after the storm and flooding incidents have also been reported in Galway, Limerick and Cork. Rebecca Mullen of The Flour House bakery in Riverstick, Cork, told the PA news agency that Storm Babet flooded the bakery last October, and the bakery had flooded again after Storm Bert. They had received grants from the Red Cross to help them through the last flood where a lot of damage was done. \u201cWithout those grants we really wouldn\u2019t have a business today, it\u2019s just really important that small businesses survive weather systems,\u201d she told the PA news agency. Mullen added: Saturday is one of our busiest days, we\u2019ve already had to cancel a market because of the weather system, so now we\u2019ve obviously had to shut the shop today, so we\u2019ll be losing money there. I\u2019ve done deliveries of cakes today where I can to the people who have ordered, but now it\u2019s the clean up, its the cost of getting the staff back in, extra hours, working out what is salvageable and what isn\u2019t.\u201d She said small businesses are already struggling because of rising costs such as the 13.5% VAT rate and staff pay. She said: Every day counts. You can\u2019t miss a day\u2019s trade. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s going to really hurt us. Every single piece of coinage is required to get us through.\u201d In Northern Ireland, a yellow alert for rain and snow was in place across the region from midnight until 11am on Saturday, while a wind warning is in place until Saturday evening. Thousands of homes are without power, roads are flooded and flights have been cancelled \u2013 but the worst of Storm Bert is still to come, according to UK power officals. Winds of up to 70mph are forecast to batter coastal areas and, as temperatures rise on Saturday, melting snow and heavy rain are causing flooding, reports the PA news agency. The National Grid said about 4,000 homes in its region of the Midlands, south-west England and south Wales, are without power. Ross Easton, of Energy Networks Association (ENA) \u2013 which represents the UK\u2019s power network operators, said: There are a few localised weather-related power cuts in parts of Britain this morning. However, for most parts of the country the severe weather hasn\u2019t yet had a significant impact. Forecasters are describing this as a \u2018multi-hazard event\u2019 with the worst of the weather yet to arrive, and so our members have extra engineers and contact centre teams available, and control rooms are monitoring the storm closely as it develops.\u201d The M48 Severn Bridge in Gloucestershire was closed because of strong winds, and the A66 in County Durham was closed both ways between the A67 and A645 due to snow. Traffic has been at a standstill on the M80 near Castlecary, North Lanarkshire, Scotland. Meanwhile, flights were disrupted at Newcastle airport as heavy snow hit the north-east overnight and into Saturday morning. Some arrivals were diverted to Belfast and Edinburgh while the airport\u2019s snow team tried to minimise disruption. Six weather warnings remain in place and Scots are being urged not to travel \u201cunless absolutely necessary\u201d as Storm Bert continues to cause travel disruption across the country. Forecasters have predicted as much as 40cm of snow on high grounds in Scotland as central areas remain in an amber alert for snow and ice until 5pm today. Avanti West Coast has cancelled its service between Edinburgh and Carlisle all day on Saturday with the next direct service from Carlisle not scheduled to run until Sunday afternoon, reports the PA news agency. Farther south, heavy showers are hitting England. The Met Office forecasts heavy rain developing overnight and into Sunday for south-west and southern England, stretching from Oxford to Truro. The yellow warning is in place from 6am Saturday until 11.45pm on Sunday and up to 70mm of rain could fall during this time. There is a chance that some places over Dartmoor could see 100-150mm of rainfall, the national weather service said. A wind warning covers coastal areas of southern England and Wales from 9am on Saturday until 9pm on Sunday. UK Power Networks, the operator for the east and south-east of England, has warned people to stay away from overhead power lines amid the gusts. One of Scotland\u2019s biggest bus firms has paused its services due to the impact of Storm Bert. Lothian Buses, which operates the majority of routes in Edinburgh, as well as services in East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian, said buses had been halted due to safety concerns. In a post on X, the firm said: Due to adverse weather across the network, buses are unable to continue due to safety concerns. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused, and thank you for your patience while our teams work to assess routes.\u201d Ealier we reported on the flood alerts and warning issued across England and provided a link to a live Gov.uk map for updates. Natural Resources Wales has an interactive map showing 31 flood alerts and one flood warning (River Loughor at Ammanford and Llandybie) currently. Across Scotland, there are now six flood alerts and one flood warning (Churchill Barriers), according to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa). You can check live updates here. The Irish meteorological service, Met \u00c9ireann, has a yellow wind warning for Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford and Wicklow. It also has issued a yellow gale warning for all coasts of Ireland and on the Irish Sea. All warnings are updated here. A yellow wind warning has also been issued by the Met Office for Northern Ireland. The Belfast Live is reporting \u201csevere flooding\u201d across Northern Ireland, citing the West Belfast MLA, Danny Baker: Twinbrook, close to Aspen is completely blocked &amp; Mckinstry/ 4 Laner/ Stewartstown Road now very dangerous. Colin Connect is badly flooded and road just about passable, Michael Ferguson Roundabout/ Dunmurry Lane and bottom of Suffolk also flooded. Everywhere is being reported but the impact is so severe this may take sometime and weather warnings are still in place. Please be careful.\u201d Here are some of the latest images from around the country: Scots are being urged not to travel \u201cunless absolutely necessary\u201d. As we\u2019ve reported, major roads have been closed following multiple crashes, while trains and ferries have been cancelled amid strong winds, heavy rain, snow and ice. Emergency services closed junctions 13 and 14 of the M74 following a crash at around 7am. Traffic Scotland has warned of \u201cextremely poor driving conditions\u201d in the area. The Met Office says: Heavy snow will spread north-eastwards on Saturday morning, giving significant accumulations in many areas. Accumulations of 10-20cm are likely on ground typically above 200m, with potentially as much as 20-40 cm on hills above 400m. Snow will eventually revert to rain during Saturday afternoon but may be preceded by a short spell of freezing rain in places adding to the ice risk. Strengthening winds will lead to drifting of lying snow, with difficult travelling conditions likely on higher level routes, and the risk of interruptions to power supplies. A fairly rapid thaw of lying snow is then likely on Saturday night as milder air moves in. The Queensferry Crossing across the Firth of Forth in Scotland has been closed as a safety precaution due to Storm Bert. According to The Herald, the decision to close the crossing at 10.20am was made after ice was observed falling from the bridge\u2019s stay cables above the carriageway. It cited the road maintenance and management firm, BEAR Scotland, as diverting drivers via the Forth Bridge. Dave Bishop, BEAR Scotland\u2019s south-east unit bridges manager, told the publication: A diversion via the Forth Road Bridge is currently being opened and we expect traffic to be on the move again within the hour. Drivers are advised to adhere to Red X signs for safety or there could be longer wait times for the diversion to be activated.\u201d In a post on X at 10.35am, Traffic Scotland wrote: The M90 is CLOSED in both directions for the safety reasons. Traffic will instead divert on to the Forth Road Bridge. Traffic is slow on approach with traffic temporarily held to set-up the diversion.\u201d It also posted an update at 11.35am saying that the M80 northbound at juntion seven was blocked \u201cdue to two HGV\u2019s which have lost traction\u201d. It added that traffic was being held while gritters and ploughs treated the area. Our pictures team have shared these images coming in this morning on the newswires: A Championship football match in Lancashire has been postponed due to torrential rain, reports the PA news agency. Blackburn Rovers were to face Portsmouth at Ewood Park at 3pm on Saturday but the match will now be played at a later date. In a post on X, Blackburn Rovers said: Due to an unplayable pitch caused by torrential rain, today\u2019s match against Portsmouth at Ewood Park has been postponed by the match official. We will announce details of the rearranged fixture in due course.\u201d Manchester airport and Edinburgh airport have told the PA news agency that they do not anticipate disruption due to Storm Bert. A spokesperson for Manchester airport said: If there are strong gusts when planes come in to land they might do a go around but we are not anticipating any disruption.\u201d According to the Gov.uk website, there are now 49 flood alerts across the England and one flood warning. Flood alerts mean that flooding is possible, whereas a flood warning shows that flooding is expected. The flood warning in place is for rivers in Accrington and Oswaldtwistle in Lancashire, with Gov.uk saying that heavy rain from Storm Bert is expected to cause flooding in those areas from 11am on Saturday morning. The areas most at risk include the River Hyndburn, Woodnook and Broad Oak Water, Antley Syke, Pleck, Hynburn, Tinker, Lottice and Whiteash Brooks in Accrington and Oswaldtwistle. It adds that this is comprising Dunnyshop, Baxenden, Lower Fold, Peel Bank, Barnfield and Little Moor End. Weather conditions are expected to improve this afternoon and no further flooding is expected, it states. A live flood map is available on the Gov.uk website. Here are some of the Storm Bert related images from the last 24 hours on the newswires: Dublin airport has said that while \u201cit\u2019s wet and windy \u2026 flights are moving well\u201d. In an update at 10am on Saturday, via a social media post, Dublin airport said a \u201cvery small number\u201d of departing flights had experienced delays due to wind conditions, but no flights have been cancelled so far. It advised passengers to ontact their airline directly for updates regarding specific flights. The PA news agency has some additional detail on reports that Newcastle International airport flights have been disrupted. It reports that the airport\u2019s online departure board shows many flights scheduled to depart this morning have been delayed, while the 9.30am British Airways service to Heathrow was cancelled. The live arrival board shows flights diverted to Belfast and Edinburgh, it adds. Passengers have reported travel disruption at Newcastle International airport and at Leeds Bradford airport on social media this morning, the Mirror reports. It noted that Newcastle International had not yet confirmed whether flights have been suspended. In its latest update on X, Newcastle International airport wrote: Due to Storm Bert, the airport has had continuous, heavy snow this morning. Our snow team is operational and are working hard to keep any disruption to a minimum and we will provide a further update later this morning. Passengers are advised to visit our website for the latest flight information and to contact their airline directly if they have any queries.\u201d Leeds Bradford airport has said that its runway is expected to reopen at 10am after teams worked to clear overnight and ongoing snowfall. It added that its terminal is continuing to operate as normal. Further to the news that high winds have caused power outages for 60,000 homes, businesses and farms in Ireland (see 9.48am GMT), the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) has released a statement saying that its crews are mobilised in affected areas and responding to faults where it is safe to do so. The ESB add that further power outages, as a result of Storm Bert, cand be expected. It advises checking estimated restoration times via PowerCheck.ie and ESBNetworks.ie. It also warns the public not to touch or approach fallen wires or damaged electricty networks as they are live and extremely dangerous. Several areas have been hit by flooding and power cuts after Storm Bert swept across the Ireland overnight on Friday, reports the PA news agency. The Electricity Supply Board (ESB) said that high winds had caused power outages for 60,000 customers, with the worst affected counties including Donegal, Sligo, Mayo, Galway, Cavan, Monaghan, Kerry and Cork. Status red rain warnings were issued by forecasters for Cork and Galway until 10am on Saturday, while an orange alert for rain was in place for 10 hours for counties Waterford, Kerry, Clare, Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim. A yellow alert for wind and rain warnings remains in place for most counties until midday on Saturday, with a snow-ice warning in place for County Donegal. According to the PA news agency, Cork airport said it was operating normally despite the weather conditions, while images posted online appeared to show that the River Feale in west Limerick had burst its banks. There has also been major flooding on Bridge Street in Killybegs, County Donegal, while flooding has also been reported in Galway. Flooding and gusty winds are expected across Ireland on Saturday, according to forecasters Met Eireann, but will ease off in the mid-afternoon before more heavy rain moves in from the west. In Northern Ireland, a yellow alert for rain and snow is in place across the region from midnight until 11am on Saturday, while a wind warning is in place until Saturday evening. Police urged motorists to take extra care on a number of roads in the Newtownards area because of the impact of poor weather conditions on Saturday. It said that a fallen tree on the Belfast Road and on the Springvale Road, between Ballyhalbert and Ballywalter, has blocked both lanes. The PSNI said a shed roof has been blown on to the Ballyquinn Road, Dungiven and is causing an obstruction, and there is a heavy buildup of traffic in the Dunhill Road area of Coleraine because of snow. Ferry operator DFDS has cancelled services on some routes until Monday with sailings from Newhaven to Dieppe and Dover to Calais being severely affected. Storm Bert is battering the UK with strong winds, heavy rain and snow and ice with amber warnings coming into force bringing a \u201cpotential risk to life and property\u201d. Travel is widely disrupted with roads closed and some train routes cancelled throughout Saturday with rail companies urging passengers to avoid travelling to certain areas. Winds of up to 68mph have been recorded and 13cm of snow has fallen in some parts of the country on Saturday morning, a Met Office spokesperson said, reports the PA news agency. National Highways has issued a \u201csevere weather alert\u201d for snow affecting Yorkshire and north-east England with \u201cblizzard conditions\u201d expected and up to five hours of heavy snow set to \u201caccumulate quickly at all levels\u201d. The Met Office has issued an amber warning for snow and ice for parts of Scotland and northern England, with a \u201cgood chance some rural communities could be cut off\u201d. Amber warnings mean there is the potential for risk to life and property. \u201cTravel delays on roads are likely, stranding some vehicles and passengers\u201d the national weather service said. Met Office meteorologist Craig Snell said the effects of the storm would continue throughout the weekend. \u201cWe expect the worst of the snow to pass by 12pm in Yorkshire but there will be some heavy rain and travelling conditions throughout the day will be pretty poor,\u201d he said. He told the PA news agency there was 13cm of snow measured in Leek in Staffordshire on Saturday morning and 68mph winds in Brixham, Devon. \u201cAs milder weather comes in snow will melt, leading to pretty hazardous conditions,\u201d Snell said. The PA news agency has some more travel disruption updates: The M48 Severn Bridge in Gloucestershire is closed in both directions between J1 and J2 due to strong winds and National Highways has advised motorists to use the M4 Prince of Wales Bridge. Avanti West Coast, which runs the west coast mainline services, has cancelled its services north of Preston all day. Weather warnings and 16 flood alerts have come into effect across the UK. Here are all the details we have so far on them, via the PA news agency: Yorkshire and northern England National Highways issued a \u201csevere weather alert\u201d for snow affecting Yorkshire and north-east England between 5am and 3pm on Saturday. A second amber warning will be in place between 7am and midday on Saturday covering parts of Yorkshire and the north-east of England. Rain and snow warnings cover northern England from 4am to 9am on Saturday. Scotland An amber alert for heavy snow and ice is in force between 7am and 5pm on Saturday in areas across Scotland, where 10-20cm is likely on ground above 200 metres and as much as 20-40cm on hills above 400 metres. The weather warning covers parts of Angus, Perth and Kinross, Stirlingshire, Aberdeenshire and some of the Highlands, Argyll and Bute, the Borders, Dumfries and Galloway, East Ayrshire and South Lanarkshire. Perth and Kinross council cancelled its annual Perth Christmas lights switch-on event over safety and travel concerns. Wind warnings cover Scotland from 5am until 7pm on Saturday. Wales and the south-west of England Over the weekend, Wales and the south-west of England are at risk of seeing 75mm of rain widely, and more than 100mm over the higher parts of south Wales and Dartmoor. Strong winds are expected to strike the southern coast with gusts of more than 70mph in places. A wind warning covers coastal areas of southern England from 3pm until 9pm on Saturday. Rain warnings cover much of Wales from 6am on Saturday until 6am on Sunday, and south-west England from 6am on Saturday until 11.45pm. Northern Ireland Rain and snow warnings cover Northern Ireland from midnight on Friday until 11am on Saturday. Elsewhere Yellow wind, rain and snow warnings cover much of the rest of the UK on Saturday and into Sunday. Met Office meteorologist, Aidan McGivern, said Storm Bert\u2019s arrival was after a \u201crelatively quiet\u201d night on Friday with temperatures at around -4C across parts of Scotland and -1C in eastern England. Storm Bert has begun to make an impact in the UK with snow closing roads and strong rains and winds expected to cause further travel disruption and potential flooding. Here are some of the travel disruptions reported so far by the PA news agency: In Scotland, there will be speed restrictions on the West Highland Line, Highland Mainline, Stranraer line, Glasgow South western Line, Far North Line, and west coast mainline between Carstairs and the border. ScotRail has withdrawn services from Inverness to Elgin, Aberdeen to Inverurie, and Glasgow Queen Street to Oban while trains from Glasgow Central to Carlisle will terminate at Dumfries. CalMac \u2013 a ferry operator which serves the west coast of Scotland \u2013 has cancelled several sailings on Saturday with disruption expected on many other services. P&amp;O Ferries said it had cancelled the 4am sailing between Larne in Northern Ireland and Cairnryan in Scotland\u2019s south west on Saturday. South Western Rail (SWR) asked passengers to only travel west of Basingstoke if their journeys are essential. SWR announced services between Exeter and London Waterloo will start and finish at Basingstoke, that journey times will be longer between Salisbury and Exeter and between Bournemouth and Weymouth due to speed restrictions, and services across its network will start later than usual on Sunday and Monday because of safety inspections. TransPennine Express \u201cstrongly\u201d urged customers not to travel north of Carlisle on Saturday while Avanti West Coast advised passengers not to travel north of Preston \u2013 including Lancaster, Oxenholme, Penrith, Carlisle, Glasgow and Edinburgh. National Highways issued a \u201csevere weather alert\u201d for snow affecting Yorkshire and north-east England between 5am and 3pm on Saturday. In Yorkshire, the A628 remained closed overnight in both directions between the A616 Hollingworth and the A57 Flouch due to snow, National Highways announced. The A66 Trans-Pennine route was closed between the A6 and the M6 (J40). UK airports are not anticipating disruption. A spokesperson for Birmingham airport said: \u201cWhilst we are not anticipating disruption at this time \u2026 we will continue to keep a close eye on the situation, as Storm Bert moves in.\u201d Manchester airport said \u201cwe\u2019re expecting bad weather but aren\u2019t anticipating any disruption\u201d while Newcastle airport said it will be operating as normal overnight with teams \u201cfully prepared to respond should conditions deteriorate\u201d. New national severe weather warnings have been issued for the weekend by the Met Office as Storm Bert has begun to make an impact with snow closing roads and strong rains and winds expected to cause further travel disruption and potential flooding. Weather warnings and 16 flood alerts have come into effect across the UK, as the Met Office described the forecasted weather as a \u201cmultiple hazard event\u201d due to Storm Bert binging with it snow, ice, heavy rain and gale force winds. Met Office meteorologist, Aidan McGivern, said: We\u2019ll see two to four hours of heavy snow across parts of northern England and Scotland during Saturday morning. This snow will accumulate thick and fast, with five to 10cm at lower levels and as much as 20 to 40cm over hills accompanied by strong winds. You can expect blizzards over hills across northern England and Scotland, atrocious conditions for travelling and going over the hills and also the risk of power interruptions because of snow build up on power lines. So all in all, a multiple hazard event as we go into Saturday morning.\u201d The PA news agency reports that rail companies urged passengers to avoid travelling to certain areas and some warned of reduced services while National Highways issued a \u201csevere weather alert\u201d for snow affecting Yorkshire and north-east England between 5am and 3pm on Saturday. In Yorkshire, the A628 remained closed overnight in both directions, while ferry operator CalMac \u2013 which serves the west coast of Scotland \u2013 has cancelled several sailings on Saturday with disruption expected on many other services. McGivern also stressed that temperatures will rise quickly as the storm brings with it milder air from the Atlantic, resulting in a \u201crapid thaw\u201d by the afternoon. The meteorologist said: The melting snow and the heavy rain could lead to localised flooding in places but the wettest spots would be Wales, in the south-west, particularly over south-facing hills, that\u2019s where we\u2019re likely to see gales and certainly the risk of impacts from wind as well as from rain.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Parents have accused an academy school in east London of causing serious harm to children\u2019s mental health, with teachers humiliating and \u201cscreaming\u201d at pupils, and have urged the local authority to exercise extraordinary powers to intervene. A group of nearly 30 parents and former teachers has spoken out about treatment of children at Mossbourne Victoria Park academy (MVPA) in Hackney. The secondary school, rated outstanding by Ofsted and known for its high examination grades and tough discipline, is in the same federation as the acclaimed Mossbourne Community academy, also in Hackney and originally run by Sir Michael Wilshaw, the former chief inspector of schools for England who led Ofsted from 2012 to 2016. A dossier of allegations about children\u2019s experiences at the academy, shared with the Observer, includes first years being \u201cscreamed at\u201d by senior leaders and five accounts of secondary-age pupils with no prior incontinence issues soiling themselves, or menstruating through their uniforms, because they were not allowed to go to the toilet or were too scared to ask. A number of parents said their children had suffered anxiety and depression as a result of the school\u2019s treatment. All the children\u2019s experiences took place within the last four years. Seven of the children have been removed from the school by their parents. Local authorities have little power over academies but the campaign group, which includes two local councillors, are demanding Hackney council launches a safeguarding practice review \u2013 more commonly used for serious individual cases of child abuse. As well as calling on the local authority to investigate MVPA, the group wants it to review all Hackney academies and is asking other parents with concerns to come forward. Earlier this month, the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, told a conference of educational trusts that children feeling a sense of \u201cbelonging\u201d at school was just as important as attaining good grades. Andy Leary-May, the parent leading the campaign, acknowledged that MVPA gets \u201cgreat results\u201d and \u201cworks well\u201d for many pupils. He has one child at the school himself, but took his other child out after they had negative experiences. He said: \u201cI believe it should do this without throwing a significant number of pupils under the bus \u2013 children who struggle to fit in through no fault of their own.\u201d A former teacher who left the academy recently and asked to remain anonymous said other colleagues \u201cthreatened and humiliated children\u201d and \u201cregularly screamed at them\u201d. They said: \u201cI watched new year 7 pupils lined up on the field while senior leaders were shouting at them and threatening them about what would happen if they broke the rules. It was scary.\u201d When the first Mossbourne academy opened in 2004, with Wilshaw as its superhead, it was celebrated for transforming attainment in one of London\u2019s most deprived boroughs through rigid discipline. Its rules \u2013 including no special handshakes, no hugging and no gathering in large groups \u2013 became well known and influential, and the academy was lauded in 2011 by then education secretary Michael Gove for its \u201cexceptional\u201d results and for managing to send children to top universities such as Oxbridge. MVPA opened in 2014 and the former teacher who spoke anonymously said they were initially impressed by how well behaved and engaged its pupils were, but added: \u201cI soon realised the price for that was too high.\u201d Many of the complaints put forward by the parent group relate to children with special educational needs.

They don\u2019t care if it destroys your child.\u201d Another father said his son became \u201cobsessively fearful\u201d of getting detention for having the wrong pens. He often got up in the night to check his school bag and stopped sleeping. His anxiety became so bad that he was unable to go to school for a year. When he attempted to reintegrate, his parents said a teacher publicly reprimanded him and sent him home to have his fringe cut. \u201cThey knew he was under a psychiatrist, on medication, had only just made it back in and was scared, but they still pulled him out,\u201d his father said. The group alleges that the school tries to deter special educational needs children from attending. A mother said that she and her autistic daughter attended the MVPA open evening but the school \u201crefused to offer any flexibility or reassurance\u201d, saying her daughter should expect shouting and would not be given somewhere to go if she was feeling overwhelmed. \u201cThey just kept repeating this mantra: \u2018There will be no exceptions\u2019,\u201d the mother said. Dan Rosenberg, partner at law firm Simpson Millar, who is representing the parents, said: \u201cFailure to make reasonable adjustments is discriminatory, and given the state of Camhs waiting lists, schools cannot hide behind the lack of a formal diagnosis.\u201d A spokesperson for the Mossbourne Federation said: \u201cWe were saddened to read these accounts as we do not recognise the characterisation of the school. While we have high expectations of behaviour and attitudes to learning, we are very proud of being a diverse and inclusive trust, in which children and young people thrive and go on to secure outstanding results. \u201cWe take any issues raised by parents seriously and investigate them fully. We have also had external reviews by Ofsted and the local authority \u2013 in none of these were any concerns raised.\u201d",

Forever.\u201d Smith, the Liberal Gun Club spokesperson, said many new members said the post motivated them to join. \u201cIf there\u2019s men out there that really think like that, I want at least a fighting chance if I ever encounter one,\u201d said Kylee Ortega, a 24-year-old Texan who bought a pink stun gun featuring a cartoon Grim Reaper and a strawberry keychain that can be used to stab people. Trans gun enthusiasts and content creators are also hearing from their previously gun-shy friends who want to learn defensive shooting. Jessie McGrath, 63, a lifelong Republican who is trans, grew up around guns on farms in Colorado and Nebraska. She decided to vote for Harris when Republicans started attacking gender-affirming care and \u201cwanting to basically outlaw my ability to exist\u201d. She ended up being a delegate at the Democratic national convention. \u201cGovernment getting involved in making healthcare decisions is something that I never thought I would see the Republican party doing,\u201d she said. McGrath, a veteran and prosecutor, now splits her time between Los Angeles and Omaha, and said she plans on taking a group of friends shooting when she\u2019s back in Nebraska next month. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a huge uptick in women who don\u2019t like guns who are thinking about at least getting trained on it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a real, valid feeling that these people have, because the attacks have gotten larger. They\u2019ve gotten more vitriolic.\u201d While many women and LGBTQ+ folks cite protection as a reason for owning a gun, and may feel comforted having one, Harvard University research shows that it\u2019s relatively rare to use a gun in self-defense. A meta-analysis by the University of California, San Francisco found that women with access to firearms are three times more likely to be killed than women who don\u2019t have access. Tacticool Girlfriend, a trans woman and gun YouTuber with more than 62,000 subscribers, said she was concerned that people were panic-buying guns because of Trump\u2019s win. \u201cGuns are not going to answer most of people\u2019s problems, even in the realm of self-defense. Training to use and carry pepper spray and studying martial arts will always be far more practical and useful in everyday self-defense scenarios,\u201d she said, noting that gun ownership is costly in both time and money. \u201cIf you can\u2019t dry-fire at least once a week and go out to the range once a month on average, you\u2019re likely to become more of a liability to yourself and everyone around you in the event that you ever needed a gun.\u201d",

Beaumaris football club, the Australian rules team for which the two women played, said in a statement: \u201cTwo beautiful lives lost, both with so much potential, love and spirit, leaves us both numb and without words. \u201cIn somewhat poignant circumstances, news of Holly\u2019s passing came to light as our senior playing group came together in solidarity last night. As a club, we continue to be heartened by the countless messages of support we have received,\u201d it said. Teammates tied blue and yellow ribbons, the club\u2019s colours, around the community in memory of the girls, and in support of their parents. Thai authorities confirmed Jones had died of \u201cbrain swelling due to high levels of methanol found in her system\u201d. The friends were taken to hospital after they were found unwell in their room at the Nana Backpacker Hostel. British tourist Simone White, 28, from Orpington, south-east London, was also confirmed to have died on Friday. Her parents said they were \u201cdevastated by the loss of our beautiful, kind and loving daughter\u201d. The Foreign Office in the UK said White had died of suspected of methanol poisoning. Details about the deaths of the American and two Danish tourists have not been released. Vang Vieng, which is in central Laos and surrounded by limestone mountains, was once known as a raucous and hedonistic party spot, famous for \u201ctubing\u201d, where travellers ride tractor-tyre inner tubes down the Nam Song River, and stopping off at bars along the way. A series of tourist deaths prompted a crackdown on riverside bars and a temporary ban on tubing in 2012, and the town has since rebranded and attracted a wider range of visitors, including tourists from China and South Korea. It remains popular among western backpackers, however, and has plenty of hostels and bars offering cheap or free alcohol. The town was bustling with visitors on Saturday, according to reports. Several governments have issued warnings to travellers visiting Laos over the past week. The UK said tourists should only consume alcoholic drinks from licensed liquor stores, and \u201ctake care if [drinks are] offered, particularly for free, or when buying spirit-based drinks\u201d. The manager and owner of the Nana Backpacker Hostel, where the tourists were staying, have been detained for questioning by police. The gates to the hostel were shut on Saturday, according to the Associated Press. Methanol, which is tasteless and odourless, is sometimes added to liquor by unscrupulous producers as a cheaper alternative to ethanol. It can also be present in homemade spirit that has not been brewed correctly. It can quickly lead to serious illness. In a statement on its website, Laos\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs expressed \u201csincere sympathy and deepest condolences to the families of the deceased\u201d. Methanol poisoning affects thousands of people every year, according to data cited by Doctors Without Borders, and is most common in Asia, including south-east Asian countries such as Indonesian, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines, where it is caused by illegally or informally produced liquors such as rice wine brews or counterfeit spirits.

De-Lisser has only vague memories of the shoot. \u201cI simply recall those shellsuits and trainers, which had, surprisingly, been bought for us a few days before by the school [so we could] perform in a music competition at the Hackney Empire,\u201d he says. De-Lisser had already formed a pop and R&amp;B group, Special FX, with him and Copeland on keyboards while Rudder sang. They did gigs in south London, including the Fridge bar in Brixton, before eventually breaking up. Their youthful promise has been borne out. All three, despite being at what Copeland calls a \u201cvery tough and maniacal school\u201d, have forged successful careers, even though they left at 15 with just a few qualifications. De-Lisser, like Rudder, initially worked in junior roles at NatWest bank. \u201cI wanted to go into the music world but my parents, who had come from the West Indies, didn\u2019t think it a financially sustainable career.\u201d He eventually got to college, then university and finally to the Central School of Speech and Drama by his late 20s. De-Lisser is now one of Britain\u2019s leading voice coaches, working on TV shows including The Masked Singer, The Voice UK and Our Dementia Choir with Vicky McClure, as well as lecturing. He also runs his own successful choir group, Singology. \u201cMy church bans electronic music, so the voice is very important. In fact, the voice itself is really a beautiful instrument.\u201d Copeland moved from investment banking into property, while Rudder has worked as head of operations at visitor attractions including the View from the Shard and the London Transport Museum. All three are married and live in south London. Their reunion with Pollard on Tuesday night was, understandably, emotional. \u201cThat photo represents what Tulse Hill School was all about,\u201d says Copeland. \u201cA lot of differences but everyone pulling together. We were lucky too to have some really good teachers.\u201d These included Caroline Griffin, who has since worked in the theatre and as a poet. Pollard, whose work has been in exhibitions at the Hayward Gallery and the V&amp;A, now plans \u201ca bigger and better\u201d get-together in January. \u201cI will give them each a copy of the 1989 photo \u2013 the boys in their shellsuits.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from the Ukraine live blog for today. Thanks for following along. To carry on reading all the latest news from Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, see our coverage here. Russian drone and missile attacks damaged 321 Ukrainian port infrastructure facilities from July 2023 up to now, president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Saturday. He said that 20 civilian ships of other countries were also damaged by Russian strikes. In case you missed it, Russia has sent air defence missiles and other military technology to North Korea in return for the deployment of troops from the North to support the Kremlin\u2019s war in Ukraine, intelligence officials in South Korea have said. The shipments were the latest expression of a deepening alliance that allies and enemies fear could fuel the escalation of the war in Ukraine, geopolitical tensions in Asia, and potentially even global nuclear arms proliferation. North Korea\u2019s dispatch of troops to fight against Ukraine and weapons from its vast stockpiles has been repaid with Russian oil and advanced military technology, experts believe, although neither side has commented publicly on the practical details of their alliance. As a sign of how important the relationship is to Pyongyang, one of the country\u2019s top generals has been deployed to supervise more than 10,000 men now fortifying Russian lines in the Kursk region, the Wall Street Journal reported. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said that its forces had captured the settlement of Novodmytrivka in eastern Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region, their latest gain in what defence minister Andrei Belousov described as an accelerated advance. Ukraine\u2019s military made no mention of the village, north of the key town of Kurakhove, Reuters reported. But in a late night report, the general staff noted it was among eight villages where Russian forces were engaged in fighting and trying to advance. Reuters could not independently verify battlefield accounts from either side. Vladimir Putin has vowed to launch more strikes using an experimental intermediate-range ballistic missile as Ukraine decried the testing of the nuclear-capable weapon on its territory as an \u201cinternational crime\u201d. Speaking at a defence conference on Friday, Putin contested US claims that Russia possessed only a \u201chandful\u201d of the high-speed ballistic missiles, saying that the military had enough to continue to test them in \u201ccombat conditions\u201d and would put them into serial production. \u201cThe tests [of the missile system] have passed successfully, and I congratulate you all on that,\u201d Putin said, according to the Interfax news agency. Ukraine has lost over 40% of the territory in Russia\u2019s Kursk region that it rapidly seized in a surprise incursion in August as Russian forces have mounted waves of counter-assaults, a senior Ukrainian military source told Reuters. The source, who is on Ukraine\u2019s general staff, said Russia had deployed about 59,000 troops to the Kursk region since Kyiv\u2019s forces swept in and advanced swiftly, catching Moscow unprepared two-and-a-half years into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \u201cAt most, we controlled about 1,376 square kilometres (531 square miles), now of course this territory is smaller. The enemy is increasing its counterattacks,\u201d the source said. US president-elect Donald Trump is considering tapping Richard Grenell, his former intelligence chief, to be a special envoy for the Russia-Ukraine conflict, according to four sources familiar with the transition plans. Grenell, who served as Trump\u2019s ambassador to Germany and was acting director of national intelligence during Trump\u2019s 2017-2021 term, would play a key role in Trump\u2019s efforts to halt the war if he is ultimately selected for the post. While there is currently no special envoy dedicated solely to resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Trump is considering creating the role, according to the four sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Russia has included the territories it occupies in Ukraine in its recent greenhouse gas inventory report to the United Nations, drawing protests from Ukrainian officials and activists at the Cop29 climate summit this week. The move by Moscow comes as Russian president Vladimir Putin eyes potential peace deal negotiations with incoming US president Donald Trump that could decide the fate of vast swathes of territory, Reuters reported. \u201cWe see that Russia is using international platforms to legalise their actions, to legalise their occupation of our territory,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s deputy environment minister Olga Yukhymchuk told Reuters. The US expects thousands of North Korean troops massing in Russia will \u201csoon\u201d enter combat against Ukraine, the secretary of defence said on Saturday. About 10,000 North Korean soldiers were believed to be based in the Russian border region of Kursk, Lloyd Austin said, where they were being \u201cintegrated into the Russian formations\u201d. \u201cBased upon what they\u2019ve been trained on, the way they\u2019ve been integrated into the Russian formations, I fully expect to see them engaged in combat soon,\u201d the Pentagon chief said. He had \u201cnot seen significant reporting\u201d of North Korean troops being \u201cactively engaged in combat\u201d to date, he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged world leaders to \u201crespond firmly and decisively\u201d after the Russian missile strike on Thursday. The Ukrainian president said his country was working on developing new types of air defence to counter \u201cnew risks\u201d following Russia\u2019s deployment of a new ballistic missile. Ukraine\u2019s parliament cancelled Friday\u2019s session, legislators said, citing the risk of a Russian missile attack on the district of Kyiv where government buildings are located. \u201cThe hour of questions to the government has been cancelled,\u201d said Yevgenia Kravchuk, an MP from the ruling party. \u201cThere are signals of an increased risk of attacks on the government district in the coming days.\u201d Russia sent air defence missiles and other military technology to North Korea in return for the deployment of troops from the North to support its war in Ukraine, intelligence officials in South Korea said.

Ukrainian air defences destroyed 64 out of 114 drones launched by Russia during its latest mass airstrike, Kyiv\u2019s military said on Friday. It added that another 41 drones had been \u201clocationally lost\u201d, most likely as a result of Ukrainian signal jamming. Ukraine accused Russian forces of executing five Ukrainian prisoners of war during a single incident in eastern Ukraine last month. The prosecutor general\u2019s office claimed Russian troops shot and killed the five unarmed Ukrainian soldiers after capturing them during an assault on their position on 2 October on the outskirts of Vuhledar town in the country\u2019s east. Ukraine has lost over 40% of the territory in Russia\u2019s Kursk region that it rapidly seized in a surprise incursion in August as Russian forces have mounted waves of counter-assaults, a senior Ukrainian military source told Reuters.

The enemy is increasing its counterattacks,\u201d the source said. \u201cNow we control approximately 800 square kilometres (309 square miles). We will hold this territory for as long as is militarily appropriate.\u201d The Kursk offensive was the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since the second world war and caught Moscow unprepared, Reuters reported. With the thrust into Kursk, Kyiv aimed to stem Russian attacks in eastern and northeastern Ukraine, force Russia to pull back forces gradually advancing in the east and give Kyiv extra leverage in any future peace negotiations. In Kyiv, as autumn turns fast turns to winter, Ukrainians in the government describe a vacuum before the arrival of Donald Trump in the White House on 20 January that will be filled by more war as both sides jockey for advantage. \u201cTrump has said he wants to end the war within 24 hours. Nobody is more interested in this topic than Ukraine,\u201d a senior official told the Guardian. \u201cBut the problem is, for the moment, everything is just speculation. Will it be the first peace plan, the second plan, the first variant, the 10th variant?\u201d they said. Ukraine is in \u201ca difficult but not catastrophic position\u201d and has little choice but to fight on and perhaps show Trump that backing Kyiv is not a losing bet. What helped this week was an 11th hour change of heart by the current US president, Joe Biden, whose White House briefed on Sunday that the US would allow its Atacms missiles, with a range of 190 miles (306km), to be used on targets inside Russia. Ukraine had been asking for permission for years, arguing that it has been unable to hit barracks, airfields and logistics sites in the Russian rear. Vladimir Putin has vowed to launch more strikes using an experimental intermediate-range ballistic missile as Ukraine decried the testing of the nuclear-capable weapon on its territory as an \u201cinternational crime\u201d. Speaking at a defence conference on Friday, Putin contested US claims that Russia possessed only a \u201chandful\u201d of the high-speed ballistic missiles, saying that the military had enough to continue to test them in \u201ccombat conditions\u201d and would put them into serial production. \u201cThe tests [of the missile system] have passed successfully, and I congratulate you all on that,\u201d Putin said, according to the Interfax news agency. \u201cAs has been said already, we\u2019ll be continuing these tests, including in combat conditions, depending on the situation and nature of threats being posed to Russia\u2019s security, especially considering that we have enough of such items, such systems ready for use in stock.\u201d At the same conference, the Russian strategic missile forces commander Sergei Karakayev said that the missiles could strike targets throughout Europe. \u201cDepending on the objectives and the range of this weapon, it can strike targets on the entire territory of Europe, which sets it apart from other types of long-range precision-guided weapons,\u201d Karakayev said. Russia launched the experimental missile, which US officials described as a modified design based on Russia\u2019s longer-range RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile, against a rocket factory in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Both Vladimir Putin and US officials have said the missile is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. US president-elect Donald Trump is considering tapping Richard Grenell, his former intelligence chief, to be a special envoy for the Russia-Ukraine conflict, according to four sources familiar with the transition plans. Grenell, who served as Trump\u2019s ambassador to Germany and was acting director of national intelligence during Trump\u2019s 2017-2021 term, would play a key role in Trump\u2019s efforts to halt the war if he is ultimately selected for the post. While there is currently no special envoy dedicated solely to resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Trump is considering creating the role, according to the four sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Trump could ultimately decide not to create a special envoy for the conflict in Ukraine, although he is strongly considering doing so, the sources said. If he does, he could ultimately select someone else for the role, and there is no guarantee Grenell would accept. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to swiftly end the conflict, although he has not said how he will do it. Russia has included the territories it occupies in Ukraine in its recent greenhouse gas inventory report to the United Nations, drawing protests from Ukrainian officials and activists at the Cop29 climate summit this week. The move by Moscow comes as Russian president Vladimir Putin eyes potential peace deal negotiations with incoming US president Donald Trump that could decide the fate of vast swathes of territory, Reuters reported. \u201cWe see that Russia is using international platforms to legalise their actions, to legalise their occupation of our territory,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s deputy environment minister Olga Yukhymchuk told Reuters. She said Ukraine is in touch with officials from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the U.N.\u2019s main climate body, to ask it to resolve the dispute. Officials representing the Russian foreign ministry and the UNFCCC did not respond to requests for comment sent on Thursday. At issue is Russia\u2019s National Inventory Report of greenhouse gas emissions for 2022, which Moscow submitted to the UNFCCC on 8 November. In the submission, reviewed by Reuters, Russia said it could only provide data for 85 out of 89 of its territories \u201cdue to the absence of baseline data on land use for the territories of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, Luhansk People\u2019s Republic, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, annexed in September 2022.\u201d Russia had already included emissions from Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region, annexed in 2014, in its last few reporting submissions to the UNFCCC. It also included Crimea\u2019s land development plans in a report to the UN Global Biodiverity Framework in 2020. Ukrainian environment minister Svitlana Grynchuk raised the issue in a speech to delegates at the Cop29 summit earlier this week, saying Russia\u2019s reporting on Ukraine territories undermines the integrity of global climate efforts. Yukhymchuk told Reuters this concern is based on the risk of double-counting of emissions over territories that together exceed the size of Portugal and Azerbaijan. \u201cIt will bring us to a point that we do not achieve any of our goals if we don\u2019t have proper reporting under the Paris Agreement,\u201d she said. Hello and welcome to the Ukraine live blog. My name is Tom Ambrose and I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest news throughout today. We start with news that Russia\u2019s defence ministry said that its forces had captured the settlement of Novodmytrivka in eastern Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region, their latest gain in what defence minister Andrei Belousov described as an accelerated advance.

Reuters could not independently verify battlefield accounts from either side. Russian defence minister Belousov was shown in a video posted online visiting a command post in Ukraine manned by the Russian army grouping \u201cNorth\u201d, where he handed out medals for bravery. \u201cThis work we have done here now has crushed the best [Ukrainian] units. Now the advance has accelerated. We have thwarted their entire 2025 campaign,\u201d he said. Ukraine\u2019s general dtaff said the Kurakhove sector of the 1,000km (600 mile) front was gripped by heavy fighting. Ten of 35 armed clashes in the sector were still raging, it said. In other developments: The US expects thousands of North Korean troops massing in Russia will \u201csoon\u201d enter combat against Ukraine, the secretary of defence said on Saturday. About 10,000 North Korean soldiers were believed to be based in the Russian border region of Kursk, Lloyd Austin said, where they were being \u201cintegrated into the Russian formations\u201d. \u201cBased upon what they\u2019ve been trained on, the way they\u2019ve been integrated into the Russian formations, I fully expect to see them engaged in combat soon,\u201d the Pentagon chief said.

The UK home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said Britain would continue to see \u201caggressive language\u201d from Vladimir Putin after he threatened to strike the UK. Cooper told Sky News there had been an \u201caggressive, blustering tone\u201d from the Russian president throughout the conflict and is was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. Meanwhile, the UK\u2019s foreign secretary, David Lammy, vowed to continue to \u201cdo everything that is necessary\u201d to help Ukraine combat Russia. Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said supporting Ukraine\u2019s self-defence was the \u201cbest protection\u201d for peace in Europe. Germany\u2019s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who held an hour-long call with Putin last week, has resisted calls to support Ukraine\u2019s longer-range strike capabilities against Russia, after the UK and the US approved Ukraine\u2019s use of Storm Shadow missiles and similar American Atacms weapons inside Russia. A British man has pleaded guilty to an arson attack on a Ukraine-linked business and accepting pay from a foreign intelligence agency. Jake Reeves, 23, admitted aggravated arson in relation to a fire in March at an east London warehouse belonging to a man only referred to in court as Mr X. He pleaded guilty to an offence under the National Security Act 2023 of obtaining a material benefit from a foreign intelligence service.",

In a significant escalation in response to the missile launches, Vladimir Putin confirmed that, for the first time in the war, Russia had fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile, targeting the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Putin also said Russia now believed it had the \u201cright\u201d to attack \u201cmilitary facilities\u201d in countries that supply Kyiv with long-range weapons. Though he did not say so specifically, he clearly meant attacks on the UK and US. Yet in truth, Britain and its allies have been under constant Russian attack since the war began. Using sabotage, arson, deniable cyber-attacks and aggressive and passive forms of covert \u201chybrid\u201d and \u201ccognitive\u201d warfare, Putin has tried to impose a high cost for western support of Ukraine. This largely silent struggle does not yet amount to a conventional military conflict between Nato and its former Soviet adversary. But in an echo of Cuba in 1962, the \u201cUkraine missile crisis\u201d \u2013 fought on land, air and in the dark-web alleyways and byways of a digitised world \u2013 points ominously in that direction. Concern that Russia\u2019s illegal, full-scale 2022 invasion of Ukraine would trigger a wider war has preoccupied western politicians and military planners from the start.

Last week\u2019s severing of Baltic Sea fibre-optic cables linking Finland to Germany and Sweden to Lithuania \u2013 all Nato members \u2013 is widely regarded as the latest manifestation of Russian hybrid warfare, and a sign of more to come. Some suggest the damage was accidental. \u201cNobody believes that,\u201d snarled Boris Pistorius, Germany\u2019s defence minister. Such scepticism is based on hard experience.

Putin\u2019s very public loosening of Russia\u2019s nuclear doctrine, which now hypothetically allows Moscow to nuke a non-nuclear-armed state such as Ukraine, was a tired propaganda ploy designed to intimidate the west. Putin is evil but he\u2019s not wholly mad. Mutual assured destruction remains a powerful counter-argument to such recklessness.

This kind of blackmail worked recently when various Russian spies and thugs were released from jail in the west in return for the freeing of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and others. Putin also has another nuclear card up his sleeve. Greenpeace warned last week that Ukraine\u2019s power network is at \u201cheightened risk of catastrophic failure\u201d. Russian airstrikes aimed at electricity sub-stations were imperilling the safety of the country\u2019s three operational nuclear power plants, the group said. If the reactors lost power, they could quickly become unstable. And then there is the possibility, floated by analysts, that Russia, by way of retaliation for Biden\u2019s missile green light, could increase support for anti-western, non-state actors, such as the Houthis in Yemen. In a way, this would merely be an extension of Putin\u2019s current policy of befriending \u201coutlaw\u201d states such as Iran and North Korea, both of which are actively assisting his Ukraine war effort. All of which, taken together, begs a huge question, so far unanswered by Britain and its allies \u2013 possibly because it has never arisen before. What is to be done when a major world power, a nuclear-armed state, a permanent member of the UN security council, a country sworn to uphold the UN charter, international human rights treaties and the laws of war, goes rogue? Putin\u2019s violently confrontational, lawless and dangerous behaviour \u2013 not only towards Ukraine but to the west and the international order in general \u2013 is unprecedented in modern times. How very ironic, how very chastening, therefore, is the thought that only another rogue \u2013 Trump \u2013 may have a chance of bringing him to heel. Biden can do nothing now to halt the war. He had his chance in 2021-2022 and blew it. His missiles, landmines and extra cash have probably come too late. And in two months\u2019 time, he will be gone. On the other hand, Trump\u2019s warped idea of peace \u2013 surrendering one quarter of Ukraine\u2019s territory and barring it from Nato and the EU \u2013 may look increasingly attractive to European leaders with little idea how to curb both overt and covert Russian aggression or how to win an unwinnable war on their own. Putin calculates that Europe, prospectively abandoned by the US, fears a no-longer-hybrid, only too real, all-out war with Russia more than it does the consequences of betraying Ukraine. Cynical brute that he is, he will keep on clandestinely pushing, probing, provoking and punishing until someone or something breaks \u2013 or Trump bails him out.",

Meanwhile, the back-and-forth between Mary and Joe continues. If you\u2019ve just joined us you may have to scroll down for context\u2026 \u201cGood Morning Joe. You are 100% correct that I want everyone in the relegation zone to lose because Everton needs help to stay up. But i don\u2019t want to spend 2 hours watching anything that resembles a France v San Marino fixture, life is too short.\u201d Gary has not pulled any punches with his assessment of Leicester\u2026 \u201cAre there really 3 teams in the Premier League worse than Leicester City?\u201d Colwill is back on his feet but walking gingerly. Enzo Maresca will be hoping it\u2019s nothing serious. Despite the win, there is some concern for the visitors with Colwill down injured on the pitch. He is currently receiving treatment from physios. After some late drama, Chelsea walk away with all three points. 90+8 min: We\u2019re into the eighth minute of added time. I don\u2019t think anyone knows how long is left at this point\u2026 90+6 min: Amid the penalty chaos, Lavia was booked for his challenge on De Cordova-Reid. Ayew converts the spot-kick! S\u00e1nchez gets a hand to it but it\u2019s not enough to keep the ball out. It\u2019s given after a VAR check! 90+4 min: Leicester appeal for another penalty \u2013 and this one SHOULD be given. De Cordova-Reid is brought down in the box by Lavia while running through on goal, but the linesman has his flag up. It will be checked\u2026 90+1min: Former Leicester midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall receives a standing ovation as he makes his way onto the King Power turf after replacing goalscorer Jackson. Five minutes have been added on\u2026 88 min: Chelsea are pretty much playing keep-ball to see out the match. Leicester\u2019s energy has significantly dropped. The hosts look like they have given up. That penalty shout certainly hasn\u2019t helped. Samuel has been in touch with his view on that penalty incident\u2026 \u201cOutside the box that challenge is given as a foul 100% of the time. Absolutely no point in having VAR if it can\u2019t correct decisions like that.\u201d 85 min: Another substitution for Chelsea as Jadon Sancho replaces Madueke on the wing. 84 min: After a brief check, no penalty is given. To say the Leicester fans are furious would be an understatement. 83 min: Huge penalty shout for Leicester! Mavididi goes to ground in the box following a challenge from Fofana. The referee dismisses it, but VAR will have a look\u2026 80 min: Chelsea are next to make some changes, with Christopher Nkunku replacing Felix and Caicedo making way for Rom\u00e9o Lavia. 79 min: Another double substitution for Leicester as Patson Daka replaces Vardy and El Khannouss makes way for Bobby De Cordova-Reid. 78 min: Faes is booked for a clumsy challenge on Jackson. 76 min: The ball is sent over to Jackson in the box, who is barely challenged by Okoli as he goes for goal with a header. Hermansen manages to keep it out initially but Fernandez is there to follow up with another header from two yards out. Poor defending from Leicester, but the visitors will be thrilled! And just like that, Fernandez may have just secured all three points for Chelsea! 73 min: Enzo Maresca is looking on nervously from the sidelines. Around 17 minutes left to play now and this match could still go either way. 70 min: Leicester make two changes as McAteer, who earned his first Premier League start this afternoon, is replaced by Stephy Mavididi. Ndidi also makes way for Jordan Ayew as the hosts look for an equaliser. 67 min: Leicester manager Steve Cooper is also shown a yellow card for his complaints after Cucurella wins a free-kick on the left following a challenge from McAteer. 65 min: S\u00e1nchez is the next man in the book. He is shown a yellow card for time wasting. 62 min: The hosts look to break forward as the ball is played through to Skipp on the right. The midfielder leaves it for Ndidi as he is in an offside position but both players are deemed off by the linesman. 59 min: Leicester have upped the energy and intensity this half. A significant improvement on the first 45 minutes. However, Chelsea still look the better team. 56 min: Palmer and Madueke appeared to take that mishap very well. Both laughed it off with no arguments. Chelsea will just be hoping that missed chance doesn\u2019t come back to bite them. 54 min: OH. MY. WORD. Madueke has just BLOCKED his own team-mate from scoring! Caicedo goes for goal with a low-driven strike which is parried to the feet of Palmer by Hermansen. The midfielder looks to pass it into the bottom-right corner from around three yards out, but Madueke cuts in front at just the wrong moment and the shot deflects off his leg before rolling behind for a goal kick! Incredibly unlucky for both Chelsea players. Very fortunate for Leicester. You don\u2019t see that every day! 52 min: Madueke plays a no-look pass through to Fernandez inside the box. The midfielder goes for the cross but it is cut out by Okoli. Chelsea have a corner and Palmer steps up to take it, but Leicester can clear the danger. 50 min: Chelsea look to play forward as Palmer sends the ball through to Madueke in the box. The winger looks to cut inside but instead runs out of play and behind for a goal kick. 48 min: Boos ring around the King Power as ex-Leicester defender Fofana prepares to take a throw-in. No love lost there. 46 min: No substitutions for either team at half-time. However, we got a rare change of officials. One of the linesmen picked up an injury during the first half and has now been replaced by the fourth official. The duo have swapped roles for the remainder of the match. We\u2019re back under way! Chelsea have certainly dominated the majority of the game so far. Leicester barely broke out of their own half in the opening 30 minutes, leaving Robert S\u00e1nchez with very little to do. However, the Blues goalkeeper was called into action when the hosts suddenly applied some pressure with just a few minutes left to play. Perhaps it was a bit of complacency from Enzo Maresca\u2019s side that invited Leicester back into the game. They will be hoping to start the second half just as they did the first. Joe from Indianapolis has been in touch with a message for Mary\u2026 \u201cWouldn\u2019t Mary be better served if Leicester continued to park the bus and invite Chelsea pressure? After all, the Foxes are in the same relegation scrap as her beloved Everton.\u201d Jackson\u2019s early strike separates the two sides at the break. 45+3 min: Chelsea have a corner in the final stages of the half. Fernandez swings it in but Leicester have a free kick following a tussle in the six-yard box. 45+1 min: Four minutes have been added on\u2026 44 min: El Khannouss completely wastes a free kick on the right and Chelsea go on the counter attack. The ball is eventually crossed to Madueke in the box, who goes for the volley but just misses the target. 42 min: Another chance for the hosts! Kristiansen receives the ball from Vardy on the overlap and plays it back to Ndidi on the edge of the box. The midfielder goes for goal with his first touch but fires his shot wide. Much better from Leicester. 40 min: Now Leicester are applying the pressure! Soumar\u00e9 challenges Caicedo in the box following a poor pass from S\u00e1nchez and wins a corner. Caicedo is shown a yellow card for his reaction \u2013 it looked like he wanted a free kick. 38 min: Chance for Leicester! McAteer cuts inside from the right before drilling a shot towards the far post. His effort flies inches from the target! What a moment that would\u2019ve been on his first Premier League start! 35 min: S\u00e1nchez touches the ball for the first time this match \u2013 10 minutes before half-time. A free kick is floated in from the left but Leicester fail to make the most of it. 33 min: No goal. Cucurella was in an offside position in the build-up. 32 min: Chelsea have the ball in the net once again thanks to Madueke, but the linesman has his flag up. It\u2019s being checked by VAR\u2026 31 min: And that\u2019s three for three. All of Leicester\u2019s central midfielders have now been booked. Skipp is the latest to receive a yellow. 29 min: Soumar\u00e9 is booked for a wild challenge on Felix. The midfielder flew into the forward with a reckless slide tackle. He\u2019s arguably lucky to walk away with just a yellow. 28 min: Leicester are starting to pick up the possession, but they are yet to challenge the Chelsea defence. Mary has messaged in urging Leicester to stop parking the bus following Chelsea\u2019s opening goal\u2026 \u201cWill that goal force Leicester to move the bus out of its parking space? The crowd is getting angry with their boys.\u201d 24 min: Caicedo goes for goal from the edge of the box but fires his first-time shot well wide, so much so that it was probably closer to the corner flag than the post. 22 min: Ndidi is shown a yellow card for a reckless challenge on Palmer. Chelsea players want him sent off. The midfielder was nowhere near the ball as he caught Palmer right on the achilles. It\u2019s been checked by VAR but the decision remains. 21 min: Leicester have crossed the halfway line! But they lose possession again within a few seconds\u2026 The home fans are becoming impatient already. 19 min: We\u2019re almost 20 minutes into this match and I still don\u2019t think S\u00e1nchez has touched the ball\u2026 16 min: Jackson spins Faes, who makes a calamitous attempt to clear the ball before Fernandez wins possession and lays it off to Jackson. The striker then skips past Okoli before firing his shot into the top-right corner with the outside of his right boot. It was coming! Jackson breaks the deadlock with a great strike! 14 min: Palmer sends the corner into the box. The ball is headed away but falls straight to the feet of Felix, who goes for goal with the outside of his right boot. His effort is way off target and flies well wide of the post. 13 min: Caicedo sends the ball wide to Madueke on the right, who plays it into Fernandez in the box. The midfielder goes for the cross but Skipp makes a crucial block. 11 min: Leicester are forced into an early change inside 11 minutes. Winks makes way for Oliver Skipp after picking up an injury. 9 min: There\u2019s some concern for Leicester now as Winks goes to ground with an injury after challenging Fernandez. Skipp is warming up. Steve Cooper could be forced into an early change here. 6 min: I don\u2019t think Leicester have managed any possession inside the Chelsea half yet. They have been quite happy to sit deep and absorb the pressure so far, but if they keep doing that they could be at risk of cracking\u2026 5 min: Chelsea have a free kick outside the Leicester penalty area. Palmer floats it in towards the back post but the hosts can clear. 3 min: Chance for Chelsea as Felix skips past Faes before sending a low-driven cross into the six-yard box. However, Hermansen is able to collect. 1 min: Chelsea have their first glimpse at goal inside the opening minute as Jackson tries to play Felix through on the left side of the box, but his pass is cut out. We\u2019re under way at the King Power Stadium! Writing all the way from California, Mary may have just summed up Jamie Vardy\u2019s game perfectly\u2026 \u201cHe doesn\u2019t inspire writers to wax poetic with his play, it isn\u2019t beautiful, it is working class glorious. This is what I imagine is going through his mind when he takes the pitch. \u2018I have a job. Score. I am working, don\u2019t bother me.\u2019\u201d The stage is set. We\u2019re just a few minutes away from kick-off! Enzo Maresca has opened up about the bond he formed with his Leicester players last season, recalling the night they gatecrashed his house to throw a 2am party after winning the Championship title. The Italian explained: \u201cIt was probably the best present I got last season when we were promoted and at around two o\u2019clock in the morning all the team arrived at my house. I was watching the [QPR vs] Leeds game and when it finished all the staff arrived. And then later, very late, the players arrived. They could be in different places to celebrate but they decided to come to my home. When I was a player I was lucky to win things but I never thought to go to the manager\u2019s house.\u201d Looking ahead to this afternoon\u2019s game, he said: \u201cI will be thankful to the club, the players and the fans. Because it was a fantastic season. I cannot control how they are going to receive me. But I can control how I receive them.\u201d Jamie Vardy is back in the Leicester starting line-up today after recovering from a back issue. Enzo Maresca heaped praise on his former No9 ahead of this afternoon\u2019s match, claiming he is the best striker of his generation. Maresca said: \u201cVardy is fantastic and people don\u2019t realise how good he is. I know that England has been quite lucky with strikers, like Kane, Rooney and many others, but if you ask me he has been the best one. \u201cHe can do many things, like run in behind and finish, but the best thing for me is his open mind. Last year he changed the way he was playing by dropping in, linking the play and he still wants to learn. But of course he still has the one thing that is most difficult to find, which is to score goals. He can be out for one week, without training, and play on the Saturday or Sunday and he\u2019s the one who scores.\u201d One Chelsea fan has been in touch to say how thrilled they are with the club\u2019s progress this season. However, they are not counting Leicester out today\u2026 \u201c#3 on the table is something that we, the Chelsea fans (yes, we are not yet extinct) have not been used to since a while. To be counted as a favourite for the top 4 and get back to UCL should be our target by May 25. \u201cLeicester is not a serious threat but then who saw the miracle of Forest when the season began. Anything is possible. We can win this 1- 4 or lose it by 5-0. We are Chelsea!\u201d Also in the Premier League today\u2026 Fulham vs Wolves Everton vs Brentford Arsenal vs Nottingham Forest Bournemouth vs Brighton Aston Villa vs Crystal Palace Manchester City vs Tottenham Leicester also suffered a serious injury blow this week, with promising winger Abdul Fatawu ruled out for the rest of the season. The 20-year-old ruptured his ACL while playing for Ghana during the international break. Manager Steve Cooper said: \u201cHe\u2019s a young player and having an ACL injury can be quite common, it\u2019s part of football, but it\u2019s still a serious injury. For it to happen at a young age is a blow for him and a blow for us. We\u2019ve very much now got to support him in every way we can to make sure his rehab is as smooth and as productive as possible. We hope he can come back a stronger player and person.\u201d James\u2019 injury nightmare Chelsea full-back Reece James took to Instagram on Thursday after it was revealed that he suffered another injury setback. He wrote: \u201cThis message is to the people that understand &amp; have respect for what I\u2019m going through... I appreciate you so much, your support and kind words go further than you could ever imagine. And just to touch on me... I\u2019m doing okay, been better and also been worse. Another challenge ahead accepted. Eventually I\u2019ll come out on top. Against all odds.\u201d James has endured a torrid time with injuries over the last five years. He spent seven months on the sidelines after suffering a hamstring issue last season. The Chelsea captain has also endured knocks to his knee, ankle and thigh over the years. His latest injury is his eighth hamstring issue in four years. Reece James is not in the Chelsea squad today. The full-back suffered another hamstring injury this week, but Enzo Maresca has played down concerns regarding a long-term spell on the sidelines. The Chelsea manager said on Thursday: \u201cWe have just one injured player and that\u2019s Reece who unfortunately felt something small in training two days ago and we don\u2019t want to take a risk for the weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s a hamstring, muscular problem. We will see, we don\u2019t know for how long, for sure [we want him fit for longer]. At the moment it is not happening but we hope it will happen soon. He is out this weekend but hopefully he can be back soon. It\u2019s probably difficult that he can be available for the Conference League [next Thursday], but hopefully soon.\u201d I want to hear from you this afternoon! Feel free to message me with any score predictions, opinions, thoughts, feelings and all that jazz. Will Enzo Maresca be outfoxed by his former team? (sorry not sorry for the pun) Or will he get another win under his belt at the King Power? Also, let me know if you\u2019re braving Storm Bert to go and watch the football today\u2026 Weather warnings have been put in place across England today amid the arrival of Storm Bert. Some EFL fixtures scheduled for this afternoon have already been postponed, including the Championship clash between Blackburn and Portsmouth as well as Accrington Stanley\u2019s trip to Bradford in League Two. Leicester starting XI: Mads Hermansen; James Justin, Wout Faes, Caleb Okoli, Victor Kristiansen; Harry Winks, Boubakary Soumar\u00e9, Wilfred Ndidi; Kasey McAteer, Bilal El Khannouss, Jamie Vardy (C). Substitutes: Danny Ward, Conor Coady, Luke Thomas, Hamza Choudhury, Oliver Skipp, Bobby De Cordova-Reid, Stephy Mavididi, Jordan Ayew, Patson Daka. Chelsea starting XI: Robert S\u00e1nchez; Wesley Fofana, Beno\u00eet Badiashile, Levi Colwill, Marc Cucurella; Moises Caicedo, Enzo Fernandez (C), Cole Palmer; Noni Madueke, Joao Felix, Nicolas Jackson. Substitutes: Filip J\u00f6rgensen, Marcus Bettinelli, Tosin Adarabioyo, Renato Veiga, Rom\u00e9o Lavia, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Jadon Sancho, Mykhailo Mudryk, Christopher Nkunku. The international break is over, the Premier League is finally back and normal business is resuming. Hello and welcome to coverage of today\u2019s Premier League clash between Leicester City and Chelsea. Enzo Maresca travels to his former home to face his former club for the first time since swapping Leicestershire for London in July. Maresca led the Foxes back to England\u2019s top flight at the first time of asking last season. Now, he is seeking glory with Chelsea. A win today will put the Blues just one point behind Manchester City. Anything less could see them leapfrogged by Arsenal, Nottingham Forest or Brighton later today. As for Leicester, a much-needed win could give them a nice cushion above the relegation zone. Kick-off is at 12:30pm GMT - join me!",

Vought has also personally advocated for recess appointments, in an 18 November interview with Tucker Carlson.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to do things not based on how it has been done recently, like this whole notion of recess appointments,\u201d Vought told Carlson. \u201cHe has to stand up an administration quickly, and he\u2019s dealing with an administration that won\u2019t move quickly to install his people.\u201d</p> <p>Vought dismissed the argument that such a move would violate the spirit of the constitution and singled out Ed Whelan, a fellow at the conservative Public Policy Center who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/11/14/trump-gaetz-cabinet-appointment-johnson/\">called</a> the proposition \u201ccockamamie\u201d and urged congressional leaders to reject it.</p> <p>\u201cConservative thinktanks, with some exceptions, are not conservative \u2013 they\u2019re tools of the left,\u201d said Vought.</p> <p>Later in the interview, Vought described his vision for wiping out swaths of federal administrators, an idea that Trump campaigned on.</p> <p>\u201cThe president has to move as fast and as aggressively as possible with a radical constitutional perspective to be able to dismantle that bureaucracy in their power centers,\u201d said Vought. \u201cNumber one is going after the whole notion of independence.

In videos <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/video-donald-trump-russ-vought-center-renewing-america-maga\">obtained</a> by ProPublica, Vought describes invoking the Insurrection Act to compel the military to crack down on protests and intentionally demoralizing career federal employees to push them out of their positions. Vought has openly promoted elevating Christianity in government, complaining in speeches about \u201csecularism\u201d and \u201cMarxism\u201d in America.</p> <p>Vought also played a role in drafting Project 2025, a sprawling policy agenda to reshape the federal government and dramatically consolidate the power of the president. In Vought\u2019s chapter of the more than 900-page document, he prescribes \u201caggressive use of the vast powers of the executive branch\u201d and describes the OMB as playing a key role in this effort.

Vought has also personally advocated for recess appointments, in an 18 November interview with Tucker Carlson. \u201cWe have to do things not based on how it has been done recently, like this whole notion of recess appointments,\u201d Vought told Carlson. \u201cHe has to stand up an administration quickly, and he\u2019s dealing with an administration that won\u2019t move quickly to install his people.\u201d Vought dismissed the argument that such a move would violate the spirit of the constitution and singled out Ed Whelan, a fellow at the conservative Public Policy Center who called the proposition \u201ccockamamie\u201d and urged congressional leaders to reject it. \u201cConservative thinktanks, with some exceptions, are not conservative \u2013 they\u2019re tools of the left,\u201d said Vought. Later in the interview, Vought described his vision for wiping out swaths of federal administrators, an idea that Trump campaigned on. \u201cThe president has to move as fast and as aggressively as possible with a radical constitutional perspective to be able to dismantle that bureaucracy in their power centers,\u201d said Vought. \u201cNumber one is going after the whole notion of independence. There are no independent agencies.\u201d During Trump\u2019s first term, when Vought served as head of the OMB, he pressed on culture war issues and sought to block agencies from conducting diversity and inclusion trainings, claiming in a memo they constituted \u201canti-American propaganda\u201d. With four years to strategize the ways that Trump could accrue executive power to quickly enact his agenda if re-elected, Vought founded a thinktank and preached his vision to Trump allies who could play a role in a second term. At events hosted in the last two years by the Center for Renewing America, Vought has espoused authoritarian ideas and plans for Trump\u2019s administration. In videos obtained by ProPublica, Vought describes invoking the Insurrection Act to compel the military to crack down on protests and intentionally demoralizing career federal employees to push them out of their positions. Vought has openly promoted elevating Christianity in government, complaining in speeches about \u201csecularism\u201d and \u201cMarxism\u201d in America. Vought also played a role in drafting Project 2025, a sprawling policy agenda to reshape the federal government and dramatically consolidate the power of the president. In Vought\u2019s chapter of the more than 900-page document, he prescribes \u201caggressive use of the vast powers of the executive branch\u201d and describes the OMB as playing a key role in this effort. According to Vought, the office he will head if confirmed must be \u201cintimately involved in all aspects of the White House policy process\u201d.",

The new study helps connect the dots among previous papers that have found concerning levels of PFAS in personal care products, umbilical cord blood, breast milk and shown health risks for developing children. The analysis of data from 2,000 women is the largest to compare personal care product usage with PFAS levels, and the findings are \u201calarming\u201d said Amber Hall, a Brown University researcher and study co-author. \u201cIt\u2019s not only getting in blood and breast milk, but it\u2019s getting in there at high enough levels that we\u2019re able to connect it with greater frequency of use,\u201d Hall said. PFAS are a class of about 15,000 compounds typically used to make products that resist water, stains and heat. They are called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not naturally break down and accumulate, and are linked to cancer, kidney disease, liver problems, immune disorders, birth defects and other serious health problems. The chemicals are widely used across the economy, and have been added to personal care products from dental floss to cosmetics, often to help spread active ingredients, or aid the skin in absorbing them. They also leach into the products from packaging or other points in the supply chain. The authors found those with the highest blood or milk levels were linked to nail care products, fragrances, makeup, hair dyes and hair sprays. Women who wore makeup daily in the first and third trimesters had 14% and 17% higher plasma and breast milk PFAS concentrations, respectively. Women who dyed their hair at least twice during pregnancy showed levels of PFOS, one of the most common and dangerous PFAS compounds, that were 36% higher than those who did not. Meanwhile, women who used nail products after giving birth were found to have PFOS levels about 27% higher. Previous research found PFAS in each of 30,000 umbilical cord blood samples taken across a five-year period in locations around the globe. Breast milk in 50 US samples were found to contain alarming levels of the chemicals. Exposure is especially dangerous for developing children because they are more vulnerable and it can trigger lifelong health problems. Among other issues related to pregnancy and development, PFAS are linked to decreased birth weight, preterm birth, shorter lactation periods, a reduction in milk\u2019s nutritional value, neuro-developmental disorders and diminished vaccine response in children. Women can take some steps to protect themselves, like reducing non-essential personal care products while pregnant or nursing. They can also find products free from toxic chemicals, though it is difficult to identify PFAS on product labels, and sometimes their inclusion is not disclosed. Some states have begun to ban or limit the use of PFAS in personal care products as an active ingredient. That may pressure companies to remove PFAS from their products across the nation so they do not have to produce different formulas for different states. \u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 24 November 2024. An earlier version included reference to dental floss; while this is a product that may contain PFAS, as the article itself said, it was not among those covered in the study.",

In New York City, Mayor Eric Adams has said the city has always welcomed immigrants and that law-abiding immigrants and families will be protected, but said that the current immigrant crisis had cost the city billions of dollars, and the federal government had not assisted it in dealing with the influx, estimated at more than 200,000 people. \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to let them work [legally],\u201d Adams said. \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to get them to participate in our tax system.\u201d But Denver\u2019s Johnston walked back comments that he had made earlier this week to Denverite about sending police officers to the county line to stop federal agencies from entering the city. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Tiananmen Square moment with the rose and the gun, right? You\u2019d have every one of those Highland moms who came out for the migrants. And you do not want to mess with them,\u201d he said. In the subsequent interview, he said he regretted using the Tiananmen Square image, from 1989, of a man blocking a tank during pro-democracy protests. \u201cWould I have taken it back if I could? Yes, I probably wouldn\u2019t have used that image,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cThat\u2019s the image I hope we can avoid. What I was trying to say is this is an outcome I hope we can avoid in this country. I think none of us want that.\u201d Johnston added that his willingness to go to jail over the issue was real. \u201cI would if I believed that our residents are having their rights violated,\u201d he said. \u201cI think things are happening that are illegal or immoral or un-American in our city, I would certainly protest it, and I would expect other residents would do the same.\u201d The mayor also said he would encourage people to protest and that he is not opposed to all deportations \u2013 a line that other sanctuary city mayors have also sought to draw \u2013 including deportations for violent criminals. \u201cWe think if you are a violent criminal that is committing serious crimes like murder or rape in Denver, you should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law and you should be deported,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>British Olympic athletes who train at an internationally renowned sailing academy on the south coast are threatening to quit the site over plans to build a \u00a3150m waste incinerator next to their base.</p> <p>Ellie Aldridge, an Olympic gold medallist, is among the competitors at the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy opposing the construction of the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm29zv82jypo\">new incinerator</a> for burning household rubbish on the Isle of Portland, on the Jurassic coast.</p> <p>The new energy plant on the isle, overlooking Weymouth Bay, will emit up to 200,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. The Tories pledged in their manifesto at the general election to stop the construction of new incinerators, but the Labour government approved the scheme in September.</p> <p>The <em>Observer</em> can reveal that Aldridge is among a number of Olympic athletes who wrote to the government last Thursday warning that the construction of the incineration plant may force some athletes to quit the site.</p> <p>The British sailing team is the most successful national Olympic sailing team of all time, and the south coast base was the sailing venue for the 2012 games. The base has been called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jul/08/team-gb-olympic-medal-factory-sailing\">an Olympic \u201cmedals factory\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Athletes are concerned at the risk of pollutants in what they describe as currently the \u201cfreshest air\u201d in Britain, sweeping across the bay and Portland harbour on the Jurassic coast, classed as a Unesco world heritage site. The developer, Powerfuel Portland, insists there will be a \u201cnet benefit\u201d for air quality across most of the area.</p> <p>\u201cThere should be another way of getting rid of waste rather than incinerating it,\u201d said Aldridge, 27, who became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/08/team-gbs-ellie-aldridge-wins-first-ever-olympic-kitesurfing-gold-medal\">first Olympic gold medallist in kitefoiling</a> at the Paris Olympics this year. \u201cThis is one of the most beautiful coastlines in the UK and I don\u2019t understand how they even got the idea to put it here.\u201d Aldridge says she is not willing to train under the plume of the new plant.</p> <p>A letter from members of the British sailing team to Steve Reed, the environment secretary, and Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, states: \u201cIf these proposals go ahead, a waste incinerator will be built next door to the academy \u2013 which has been home to the British sailing team for over a decade.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no doubt that training in Portland has contributed to Team GB\u2019s sailing success. For many of us, Portland is not just a training base but also our home.</p>    <p>\u201cThe plans to build an incinerator raise significant environmental and health concerns, which we believe would harm the quality of Portland\u2019s sailing facilities. As elite athletes, our daily training relies on clean air and water. We fear that the damage posed by an incinerator could force us to consider leaving Portland altogether.\u201d</p> <p>Other signatories include the Olympic athletes Emma Wilson, Anna Burnet, John Gimson, Hannah Snellgrove, Saskia Tidey and Freya Black.

      "bodyText": "British Olympic athletes who train at an internationally renowned sailing academy on the south coast are threatening to quit the site over plans to build a \u00a3150m waste incinerator next to their base. Ellie Aldridge, an Olympic gold medallist, is among the competitors at the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy opposing the construction of the new incinerator for burning household rubbish on the Isle of Portland, on the Jurassic coast. The new energy plant on the isle, overlooking Weymouth Bay, will emit up to 200,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. The Tories pledged in their manifesto at the general election to stop the construction of new incinerators, but the Labour government approved the scheme in September. The Observer can reveal that Aldridge is among a number of Olympic athletes who wrote to the government last Thursday warning that the construction of the incineration plant may force some athletes to quit the site. The British sailing team is the most successful national Olympic sailing team of all time, and the south coast base was the sailing venue for the 2012 games. The base has been called an Olympic \u201cmedals factory\u201d. Athletes are concerned at the risk of pollutants in what they describe as currently the \u201cfreshest air\u201d in Britain, sweeping across the bay and Portland harbour on the Jurassic coast, classed as a Unesco world heritage site. The developer, Powerfuel Portland, insists there will be a \u201cnet benefit\u201d for air quality across most of the area. \u201cThere should be another way of getting rid of waste rather than incinerating it,\u201d said Aldridge, 27, who became the first Olympic gold medallist in kitefoiling at the Paris Olympics this year. \u201cThis is one of the most beautiful coastlines in the UK and I don\u2019t understand how they even got the idea to put it here.\u201d Aldridge says she is not willing to train under the plume of the new plant. A letter from members of the British sailing team to Steve Reed, the environment secretary, and Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, states: \u201cIf these proposals go ahead, a waste incinerator will be built next door to the academy \u2013 which has been home to the British sailing team for over a decade. \u201cThere is no doubt that training in Portland has contributed to Team GB\u2019s sailing success. For many of us, Portland is not just a training base but also our home. \u201cThe plans to build an incinerator raise significant environmental and health concerns, which we believe would harm the quality of Portland\u2019s sailing facilities. As elite athletes, our daily training relies on clean air and water. We fear that the damage posed by an incinerator could force us to consider leaving Portland altogether.\u201d Other signatories include the Olympic athletes Emma Wilson, Anna Burnet, John Gimson, Hannah Snellgrove, Saskia Tidey and Freya Black. The signatories also include athletes aiming to compete at the 2028 summer Olympics in Los Angeles. \u201cWe invite people from around the world to train here,\u201d said Burnet, 32, who won silver with Gimson, 41, at the Tokyo Olympics and lives in Portland. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful and amazing venue. It will be embarrassing to have an eyesore and environmental hazard right on our training ground.\u201d The plant will have a 262ft chimney stack, operating 24 hours a day. Black, 23, who competed in Paris, said she moved to Portland to train and it was hard to \u201cthink about leaving this beautiful place\u201d. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s stunning here and I don\u2019t understand how it has become a dumping ground.\u201d Charlie Leigh, 21, who hopes to compete in the 2028 summer Olympics, said: \u201cThis is a slap in the face to Dorset council and all their initiatives to get to net zero.\u201d The Labour government approved the scheme despite a recent BBC investigation alleging that incinerators were the \u201cdirtiest way\u201d the UK generates power. Dorset council, which had rejected the scheme, warned the government decision had \u201cknee-capped our net zero ambitions\u201d. Environment Agency officials are considering an application for an environmental permit to operate the facility. Campaigners have begun legal efforts to try to overturn the decision. About 40 lorries a day of waste will be delivered to the plant overlooking the base. Incinerators across Britain have been found to have breached environmental permits for emissions of toxins and other pollutants. Public Health England says \u201cmodern, well-run and regulated municipal waste incinerators are not a significant risk to public health\u201d but it is not possible to rule out any adverse health effects.

      "body": "<p>It was a daunting task, with little likelihood of success. An adventurous but anxious graduate researcher without any experience of looking after birds was dispatched to the wilds of upstate New York to become a human eagle mother: feeding, teaching \u2013 and keeping alive \u2013 three helpless eagle chicks.</p> <p>Tina Morris was to camp alone beside their artificial nest, find them food, track them when they began to fly, keep them away from danger and rescue them if they got into trouble. If they survived to adulthood, northeast America would begin to be repopulated with its national bird, the bald eagle, a majestic, much-loved raptor that had been driven to the brink of extinction by the 1960s.</p> <p>Each morning, Morris, who was 26 at the time and the only female conservation biologist in her team, had to feed the eagles by climbing 35ft of scaffolding to an aerial hide beside the artificial nest platform where the young eagles had been placed. There was one problem: she was terrified of heights. On the very first climb, she was almost paralysed by panic. But she steeled herself, knowing that she had to do it.</p>    <p>\u201cI said, \u2018Yes, I would love to study eagles\u2019 having no idea what I was getting myself into,\u201d says Morris today, almost 50 years later, happily retired and on holiday \u2013 visiting poet Laurie Lee\u2019s former local, a gorgeous old pub in the Cotswolds. With self-effacing modesty, Morris is reflecting on her small role in a stupendous conservation success story. \u201cIt was like I was on a train and I wasn\u2019t quite sure where it was going or what I was doing, but I had to keep going. I couldn\u2019t look back. Or look down. I had a lot of fears. I\u2019d never been around big birds before and my fear of heights was very real. But I knew I could not admit I was afraid. That was part of being a woman in the male world. You can never blink. Don\u2019t ever say, \u2018I can\u2019t possibly do that,\u2019 because there\u2019ll be a man behind me who\u2019ll say, \u2018Well I can do it.\u2019 I was well aware of that.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t look down and finally made it to the aerial hide. Here, she had to keep herself concealed from the eagles, so they wouldn\u2019t become imprinted and learn to associate people with being fed. Then she fixed fresh food \u2013 scavenged roadkill or carp that she\u2019d caught \u2013 to a barbecue fork taped to a long stick, and lifted it into the nest. The eagles tore into her meals. And day by day, they grew.</p> <p>Morris was charged with making a success of a bold experiment. She was working for the <a href=\"https://peregrinefund.org/\">Peregrine Fund</a>, a pioneering conservation programme run by Professor Tom Cade from Cornell University. Cade, a 20th- century legend in conservation circles, had removed extra chicks from peregrine nests and used the falconry technique of \u201chacking\u201d to raise the young in new locations in the wild. Slowly, peregrine numbers were starting to recover in the United States. These brilliant predators, and other birds of prey, had been decimated, first by persecution and then by the agricultural use of DDT and other pesticides, which caused their egg shells to become so thin that fledging success rates plummeted. The bald eagle was another victim: 400,000 eagles soaring in the skies above the continental states in the 1800s had become just 417 nesting pairs by 1963.</p> <p>By the mid-1970s, Cade decided to try the same techniques with the bald eagle. But this new trial was an almighty rush because conservation authorities decided they must reintroduce the emblem of the nation to northeast America for the bicentennial celebrations of 1976. The trial had to be done quickly \u2013 and in secret. There was a lot of pressure. These weren\u2019t just any old bird of prey, they had been on the national seal since 1782.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a lot of pressure,\u201d says Morris. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen if I can\u2019t find that bird that just flew over the hill? It wasn\u2019t just <em>a</em> bird \u2013 I would\u2019ve lost one of the nation\u2019s birds.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout the long summer of 1976 and again in 1977, Morris camped out in Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge below the huge nest of sticks she had built for the chicks. She\u2019d had a circuitous route in conservation biology. Her passion for saving animals began in early childhood. Her family dogs ravaged rabbits, chipmunks and birds; she would admit survivors to her animal hospital of cardboard boxes in the bath. \u201cUsing eye droppers and moistened hardboiled egg yolk or chopped up earthworms, I nursed them until they died,\u201d she writes in her memoir, <em>Return to the Sky</em>. Very occasionally they lived and she released them.</p>    <p>After graduating in anthropology, a year\u2019s work in a zoo convinced her that animals belonged in the wild. \u201cI thought, whatever I do after this, I\u2019ve got to be working to get them out of these cages, not just propagating the species within the bars of the cage. That\u2019s why I loved the Peregrine Fund, because that\u2019s what they were doing,\u201d she says. She read about Cade\u2019s work restoring animals to the wild and talked her way into studying at Cornell.</p> <p>Morris\u2019s time as eagle mother was perpetually challenging. Despite her abhorrence of animal cruelty, she had to quickly learn to bludgeon carp to death with a heavy axe handle to supply the chicks with fresh food. Her first two eagles were known as W1 and W2, because they came from a nest in Wisconsin. Soon they were joined by a third, M3, who had been found by the climbing team with a broken leg, hours from death, in a nest in Michigan. His leg had healed in captivity. While W1 and W2 were older, wary and wild, M3 was easier company. \u201cHe was such a wonderful bird, because he\u2019d been handled by people, but he wasn\u2019t imprinted, and so I really loved this bird and I wanted him to succeed,\u201d she remembers.</p> <p>Morris camped with her two pet dogs, but was surprised to find loneliness was a big challenge in those early weeks. She filled her day with tasks: finding food and watching the young eagles, meticulously analysing their behaviour to learn if her strange, arm\u2019s-length surrogacy could be an effective substitute for a real eagle mother. Watching them from 3ft away, but concealed in her hide, was \u201ca lesson in monotony, occasionally peppered with wonder,\u201d she writes.</p> <p>One challenge was how to subdue the growing birds without being lacerated by their sharp talons or lethal beaks, so they could be fitted with identification bands. M3 was given a silver band labelled 03142. Radio tags were also fixed to the young birds. Morris\u2019s innovation was to cut up her blue jeans: a young eagle fitted perfectly inside the leg that acted like a straitjacket.</p> <p>The biggest test came when the eagles learned to fly. We imagine a mighty eagle simply soars into the sky, but the fledglings often flew short distances before crash-landing, unable to get themselves airborne again. Morris had to track them via the radio tags, shadowing them like an over-anxious parent, making sure they came to no harm. This was easier said than done.</p> <p>On W2\u2019s first flight, he headed straight down into a vast, inaccessible marsh. Morris had to wade through the swamp to find the grounded young eagle. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t find him, I was pretty sure he wouldn\u2019t survive the night,\u201d she says. Foxes, coyotes, a racoon or even a snapping turtle could kill or injure an unaccompanied grounded eagle. \u201cThey are totally dependent on their parents to protect them on the ground. If I had been an eagle, I would perch nearby and drop fish in front of them until they\u2019re able to get themselves out of that predicament. It might\u2019ve taken three or four days.\u201d</p>    <p>Eventually, the tracker led her to W2, \u201csitting in the middle of a pool looking totally bewildered, if an eagle can look bewildered,\u201d she remembers. She approached him slowly-slowly and quickly threw a blanket over him. \u201cThen it was matter of grabbing the right places, making sure the beak and the talons were as far away from me as possible. I held him like a football all the way back to the road where my Jeep was.\u201d Back below the nesting platform, she tucked him under her arm again and climbed up one-handed. \u201cBy then I was pretty good at that climb, I\u2019d been really practising,\u201d she laughs now.</p> <p>And so she followed the eagles around the wilderness reserve, watching their first kills and keeping them safe. One day in late September, all three birds simply flew away, as young birds do. The radio tags had a limited range and bald eagles can traverse hundreds of miles. It was not known where the birds had gone. But the \u201chacking\u201d had been a success. All three had headed off into northeast America as fully fledged independent, wild birds.</p> <p>The return of the bald eagles could now be publicised as a good news story and the media desperately wanted the tale of the young woman who had secretly tended to the chicks alone in the wilderness. Morris was besieged by interview requests, but drew back when she realised magazines wanted to put her and not the eagles on their covers. \u201cI felt very strongly that the birds should be the story. They just didn\u2019t get that.\u201d She rejected an invitation to appear on a TV show called <em>To Tell the Truth</em>; only now, years later, does she regret not taking part; her 15 minutes of fame would have amused her grandchildren.</p>    <p><em><strong>Morris reared another four eagles</strong></em> in the summer of 1977, this time assisted by a larger team from the state Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). The trial judged a success, the DEC took over the following year. Given she\u2019d overseen such a success, a high-profile PhD seemed inevitable, but Morris had met her husband, Larry, by now and wanted a project she could do in the local area. Further bald-eagle studies would have to be elsewhere, but Cade encouraged her to pitch testing the same hacking techniques with the endangered loggerhead shrike instead. Surprisingly, no funding agencies would support this and Morris had to settle for shrike survey work. Was this discrimination? \u201cThe discrimination wasn\u2019t against me as a woman, it was what I chose to do. Nobody wanted to pay for shrike research. All the funding agencies said if you just stayed with eagles, we\u2019d be happy to fund you.\u201d</p> <p>Morris became a full-time mother of four children and she and Larry rewilded a farm before the term became fashionable. Later, she taught biology at high school, always passionately seeking to get students out into nature, for education and inspiration.</p> <p>As the years passed, she often wondered about \u201cher\u201d eagles, but accepted she would probably never know their fate. Truly wild creatures don\u2019t keep in touch. Still, she could be comforted that her work helped spark a remarkable comeback. Thanks to reintroduction programmes like hers, today there are 70,000 bald eagle pairs flying free across the continental United States plus another 30,000 in Alaska.</p> <p>And then, one June day in 2015, a remarkable thing happened. Morris was clearing her desk after a day teaching when a press release dropped into her inbox headlined \u201cOldest Bald Eagle ever in US, 38, found dead in NY\u201d. Spotting a roadside rabbit, this eagle had dived and seized the creature, but not seen an approaching vehicle, which struck it dead. Someone noted its aluminium band: 03142. It was M3, the chick with a broken leg that Morris had reared and followed back in 1976.</p>    <p>She felt a whoosh of emotion. \u201cIt was really, really amazing,\u201d she says now. From his tag, it was established that M3 had been part of a settled breeding pair for three decades. He alone had fathered around 70 chicks. \u201cHe lost one female and then got a second one, and stayed loyal to that nest, which was incredible.\u201d</p> <p>And so M3 became \u201cthe inspiration\u201d for Morris to tell her story. \u201cImagine a bird with everything going against him. He wasn\u2019t even supposed to survive; coming out of his nest in Michigan with a broken leg. If the climbers hadn\u2019t been up there at that time, he would\u2019ve been dead,\u201d she says. The eagle reintroduction was \u201ca success story that had proof of success in this one bird. He embodied it all\u201d.</p> <p>Today, Morris wants to celebrate that success \u2013 and unsung heroes such as Professor Cade\u2019s right-hand man Jim Weaver, who was so supportive of her efforts \u2013 but also warn everyone that the hard-won restoration of wildlife is not guaranteed to endure.

      "bodyText": "It was a daunting task, with little likelihood of success. An adventurous but anxious graduate researcher without any experience of looking after birds was dispatched to the wilds of upstate New York to become a human eagle mother: feeding, teaching \u2013 and keeping alive \u2013 three helpless eagle chicks. Tina Morris was to camp alone beside their artificial nest, find them food, track them when they began to fly, keep them away from danger and rescue them if they got into trouble. If they survived to adulthood, northeast America would begin to be repopulated with its national bird, the bald eagle, a majestic, much-loved raptor that had been driven to the brink of extinction by the 1960s. Each morning, Morris, who was 26 at the time and the only female conservation biologist in her team, had to feed the eagles by climbing 35ft of scaffolding to an aerial hide beside the artificial nest platform where the young eagles had been placed. There was one problem: she was terrified of heights. On the very first climb, she was almost paralysed by panic. But she steeled herself, knowing that she had to do it. \u201cI said, \u2018Yes, I would love to study eagles\u2019 having no idea what I was getting myself into,\u201d says Morris today, almost 50 years later, happily retired and on holiday \u2013 visiting poet Laurie Lee\u2019s former local, a gorgeous old pub in the Cotswolds. With self-effacing modesty, Morris is reflecting on her small role in a stupendous conservation success story. \u201cIt was like I was on a train and I wasn\u2019t quite sure where it was going or what I was doing, but I had to keep going. I couldn\u2019t look back. Or look down. I had a lot of fears. I\u2019d never been around big birds before and my fear of heights was very real. But I knew I could not admit I was afraid. That was part of being a woman in the male world. You can never blink. Don\u2019t ever say, \u2018I can\u2019t possibly do that,\u2019 because there\u2019ll be a man behind me who\u2019ll say, \u2018Well I can do it.\u2019 I was well aware of that.\u201d She didn\u2019t look down and finally made it to the aerial hide. Here, she had to keep herself concealed from the eagles, so they wouldn\u2019t become imprinted and learn to associate people with being fed. Then she fixed fresh food \u2013 scavenged roadkill or carp that she\u2019d caught \u2013 to a barbecue fork taped to a long stick, and lifted it into the nest. The eagles tore into her meals. And day by day, they grew. Morris was charged with making a success of a bold experiment. She was working for the Peregrine Fund, a pioneering conservation programme run by Professor Tom Cade from Cornell University. Cade, a 20th- century legend in conservation circles, had removed extra chicks from peregrine nests and used the falconry technique of \u201chacking\u201d to raise the young in new locations in the wild. Slowly, peregrine numbers were starting to recover in the United States. These brilliant predators, and other birds of prey, had been decimated, first by persecution and then by the agricultural use of DDT and other pesticides, which caused their egg shells to become so thin that fledging success rates plummeted. The bald eagle was another victim: 400,000 eagles soaring in the skies above the continental states in the 1800s had become just 417 nesting pairs by 1963. By the mid-1970s, Cade decided to try the same techniques with the bald eagle. But this new trial was an almighty rush because conservation authorities decided they must reintroduce the emblem of the nation to northeast America for the bicentennial celebrations of 1976. The trial had to be done quickly \u2013 and in secret. There was a lot of pressure. These weren\u2019t just any old bird of prey, they had been on the national seal since 1782. \u201cThere was a lot of pressure,\u201d says Morris. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen if I can\u2019t find that bird that just flew over the hill? It wasn\u2019t just a bird \u2013 I would\u2019ve lost one of the nation\u2019s birds.\u201d Throughout the long summer of 1976 and again in 1977, Morris camped out in Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge below the huge nest of sticks she had built for the chicks. She\u2019d had a circuitous route in conservation biology. Her passion for saving animals began in early childhood. Her family dogs ravaged rabbits, chipmunks and birds; she would admit survivors to her animal hospital of cardboard boxes in the bath. \u201cUsing eye droppers and moistened hardboiled egg yolk or chopped up earthworms, I nursed them until they died,\u201d she writes in her memoir, Return to the Sky. Very occasionally they lived and she released them. After graduating in anthropology, a year\u2019s work in a zoo convinced her that animals belonged in the wild. \u201cI thought, whatever I do after this, I\u2019ve got to be working to get them out of these cages, not just propagating the species within the bars of the cage. That\u2019s why I loved the Peregrine Fund, because that\u2019s what they were doing,\u201d she says. She read about Cade\u2019s work restoring animals to the wild and talked her way into studying at Cornell. Morris\u2019s time as eagle mother was perpetually challenging. Despite her abhorrence of animal cruelty, she had to quickly learn to bludgeon carp to death with a heavy axe handle to supply the chicks with fresh food. Her first two eagles were known as W1 and W2, because they came from a nest in Wisconsin. Soon they were joined by a third, M3, who had been found by the climbing team with a broken leg, hours from death, in a nest in Michigan. His leg had healed in captivity. While W1 and W2 were older, wary and wild, M3 was easier company. \u201cHe was such a wonderful bird, because he\u2019d been handled by people, but he wasn\u2019t imprinted, and so I really loved this bird and I wanted him to succeed,\u201d she remembers. Morris camped with her two pet dogs, but was surprised to find loneliness was a big challenge in those early weeks. She filled her day with tasks: finding food and watching the young eagles, meticulously analysing their behaviour to learn if her strange, arm\u2019s-length surrogacy could be an effective substitute for a real eagle mother. Watching them from 3ft away, but concealed in her hide, was \u201ca lesson in monotony, occasionally peppered with wonder,\u201d she writes. One challenge was how to subdue the growing birds without being lacerated by their sharp talons or lethal beaks, so they could be fitted with identification bands. M3 was given a silver band labelled 03142. Radio tags were also fixed to the young birds. Morris\u2019s innovation was to cut up her blue jeans: a young eagle fitted perfectly inside the leg that acted like a straitjacket. The biggest test came when the eagles learned to fly. We imagine a mighty eagle simply soars into the sky, but the fledglings often flew short distances before crash-landing, unable to get themselves airborne again. Morris had to track them via the radio tags, shadowing them like an over-anxious parent, making sure they came to no harm. This was easier said than done. On W2\u2019s first flight, he headed straight down into a vast, inaccessible marsh. Morris had to wade through the swamp to find the grounded young eagle. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t find him, I was pretty sure he wouldn\u2019t survive the night,\u201d she says. Foxes, coyotes, a racoon or even a snapping turtle could kill or injure an unaccompanied grounded eagle. \u201cThey are totally dependent on their parents to protect them on the ground. If I had been an eagle, I would perch nearby and drop fish in front of them until they\u2019re able to get themselves out of that predicament. It might\u2019ve taken three or four days.\u201d Eventually, the tracker led her to W2, \u201csitting in the middle of a pool looking totally bewildered, if an eagle can look bewildered,\u201d she remembers. She approached him slowly-slowly and quickly threw a blanket over him. \u201cThen it was matter of grabbing the right places, making sure the beak and the talons were as far away from me as possible. I held him like a football all the way back to the road where my Jeep was.\u201d Back below the nesting platform, she tucked him under her arm again and climbed up one-handed. \u201cBy then I was pretty good at that climb, I\u2019d been really practising,\u201d she laughs now. And so she followed the eagles around the wilderness reserve, watching their first kills and keeping them safe. One day in late September, all three birds simply flew away, as young birds do. The radio tags had a limited range and bald eagles can traverse hundreds of miles. It was not known where the birds had gone. But the \u201chacking\u201d had been a success. All three had headed off into northeast America as fully fledged independent, wild birds. The return of the bald eagles could now be publicised as a good news story and the media desperately wanted the tale of the young woman who had secretly tended to the chicks alone in the wilderness. Morris was besieged by interview requests, but drew back when she realised magazines wanted to put her and not the eagles on their covers. \u201cI felt very strongly that the birds should be the story. They just didn\u2019t get that.\u201d She rejected an invitation to appear on a TV show called To Tell the Truth; only now, years later, does she regret not taking part; her 15 minutes of fame would have amused her grandchildren. Morris reared another four eagles in the summer of 1977, this time assisted by a larger team from the state Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). The trial judged a success, the DEC took over the following year. Given she\u2019d overseen such a success, a high-profile PhD seemed inevitable, but Morris had met her husband, Larry, by now and wanted a project she could do in the local area. Further bald-eagle studies would have to be elsewhere, but Cade encouraged her to pitch testing the same hacking techniques with the endangered loggerhead shrike instead. Surprisingly, no funding agencies would support this and Morris had to settle for shrike survey work. Was this discrimination? \u201cThe discrimination wasn\u2019t against me as a woman, it was what I chose to do. Nobody wanted to pay for shrike research. All the funding agencies said if you just stayed with eagles, we\u2019d be happy to fund you.\u201d Morris became a full-time mother of four children and she and Larry rewilded a farm before the term became fashionable. Later, she taught biology at high school, always passionately seeking to get students out into nature, for education and inspiration. As the years passed, she often wondered about \u201cher\u201d eagles, but accepted she would probably never know their fate. Truly wild creatures don\u2019t keep in touch. Still, she could be comforted that her work helped spark a remarkable comeback. Thanks to reintroduction programmes like hers, today there are 70,000 bald eagle pairs flying free across the continental United States plus another 30,000 in Alaska. And then, one June day in 2015, a remarkable thing happened. Morris was clearing her desk after a day teaching when a press release dropped into her inbox headlined \u201cOldest Bald Eagle ever in US, 38, found dead in NY\u201d. Spotting a roadside rabbit, this eagle had dived and seized the creature, but not seen an approaching vehicle, which struck it dead. Someone noted its aluminium band: 03142. It was M3, the chick with a broken leg that Morris had reared and followed back in 1976. She felt a whoosh of emotion. \u201cIt was really, really amazing,\u201d she says now. From his tag, it was established that M3 had been part of a settled breeding pair for three decades. He alone had fathered around 70 chicks. \u201cHe lost one female and then got a second one, and stayed loyal to that nest, which was incredible.\u201d And so M3 became \u201cthe inspiration\u201d for Morris to tell her story. \u201cImagine a bird with everything going against him. He wasn\u2019t even supposed to survive; coming out of his nest in Michigan with a broken leg. If the climbers hadn\u2019t been up there at that time, he would\u2019ve been dead,\u201d she says. The eagle reintroduction was \u201ca success story that had proof of success in this one bird. He embodied it all\u201d. Today, Morris wants to celebrate that success \u2013 and unsung heroes such as Professor Cade\u2019s right-hand man Jim Weaver, who was so supportive of her efforts \u2013 but also warn everyone that the hard-won restoration of wildlife is not guaranteed to endure. She is worried about the wildlife-killing potential of new chemicals and other pollutants, as well as the bigger issues of habitat loss, population growth and overconsumption. \u201cI want people to know we went through a really bad time with DDT and it can happen again, it will just be a different substance and a different threat,\u201d she says. \u201cThe eagle isn\u2019t out of the woods yet. There are a lot of threats. And if those threats aren\u2019t taken care of, their numbers will soon go back down again.\u201d Return to the Sky by Tina Morris is published by Chelsea Green for \u00a322 \u2022 This article was amended on 24 November 2024.

      "body": "<h2>Fresh robotic hell</h2> <p>On a scale of one to 10, just how desperate do you think Kim Kardashian is for attention? Judging by the billionaire\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kimkardashian/p/DCk9PKUpQpV/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1\">weirdly sexual photoshoot</a> with a robot, the answer may be an 11. The entrepreneur and influencer, who is a big Tesla fan, <a href=\"https://futurism.com/kim-kardashian-tesla-robot\">recently posed</a> with the company\u2019s Optimus bot in a Tesla Cybercab (a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/11/elon-musk-unveils-tesla-cybercab-self-driving-robotaxi\">self-driving taxi</a>) for a series of photos which might be described as avant-garde if you\u2019re being polite, and dystopian thirst traps if you\u2019re not. She also posted some rather less sultry <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/19/business/video/kim-kardashian-tesla-bot-digvid\">videos of her interacting</a> with the humanoid robot.</p> <p>The photoshoot has ignited something of a debate online about whether Kardashian is deliberately aligning herself with Elon Musk, who runs Tesla, and outing herself as a Trump supporter. Which is a bit of a stretch really as I\u2019m not sure that \u2013 with the exception of an admirable stint working on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/21/kim-kardashian-west-prison-reform-employment\">criminal justice reform</a> \u2013 Kardashian has ever pretended to be a leftist. Kardashian is a billionaire who has been sued for <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/kim-kardashian-being-sued-employment-practices-are-sadly-common-ncna1268626\">unfair labor practices</a> and who announced, back in 2018, that she has \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/31/entertainment/kim-kardashian-jimmy-kimmel/index.html\">nothing bad to say</a>\u201d about Trump. Her Tesla-themed photoshoot was hardly a radical new direction for her.</p> <p>It is, however, a sign of the \u201cautonomous everything\u201d direction in which we\u2019re headed. The world\u2019s most famous influencer cozying up to a robot in a self-driving taxi is yet another example of how AI-powered autonomous technology is slowly marching into our lives.</p> <p>When it comes to Tesla\u2019s Optimus robot, of course, the operative word here is <em>slowly.</em> The robot, which isn\u2019t available for sale to the general public yet, may look flashy but it isn\u2019t clear just how sophisticated it actually is yet. The Optimus robots were a major part of Tesla\u2019s Cybercab reveal in October, serving drinks to the crowd and even chatting with them \u2013 as it turns out, however, these \u201ccutting-edge\u201d robots were actually being <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/13/24269131/tesla-optimus-robots-human-controlled-cybercab-we-robot-event\">remotely controlled by humans</a>. Which is a step up, I suppose, from when Musk unveiled plans for a \u201cTesla Bot\u201d in 2021 by bringing out a human in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2021/aug/20/elon-musk-plan-tesla-bot-man-dancing-bodysuit-video\">a robot suit</a> who proceeded to breakdance to electronic music.</p> <p>Musk has been talking a big game about human-replacement robots <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/sep/30/tesla-optimus-humanoid-robot-elon-musk-ai-day\">for a long time</a>, saying they\u2019re being designed to do \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/20/humanoid-tesla-bot-likely-to-launch-next-year-says-elon-musk?ref=upstract.com&amp;curator=upstract.com&amp;utm_source=upstract.com\">boring, repetitious and dangerous</a>\u201d work. The tech billionaire, who has a habit of wildly overpromising what he is capable of, also keeps telling us they\u2019re going to be released any day now. In 2021, for example, he suggested the \u201cTesla bot\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/20/humanoid-tesla-bot-likely-to-launch-next-year-says-elon-musk?ref=upstract.com&amp;curator=upstract.com&amp;utm_source=upstract.com\">would launch in 2022</a>. Earlier this year he claimed Tesla will produce \u201cgenuinely useful\u201d humanoid robots to start <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/23/elon-musk-tesla-humanoid-robots-optimus\">working in its factories</a> next year and plans to roll them out to other companies in 2026. I wouldn\u2019t hold your breath that this will actually happen.</p> <p>Which is not to say, however, that development of <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/4913721-los-angeles-police-department-crimefighting-robot-dog/\">these sorts of robots</a> is a long way away. Robotic dogs, made by Boston Dynamics, are already being deployed by police departments and one has been <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30p16gn3pvo\">guarding Trump at Mar-a-Lago</a>. Deadlier versions of these dogs are also in the works: the US army has <a href=\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/10/01/army-has-sent-armed-robot-dog-middle-east-testing.html\">reportedly sent</a> at least one \u201crobot dog\u201d armed with an artificial intelligence-enabled gun turret to Saudi Arabia for testing.</p> <p>More generally, military use of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/14/ais-oppenheimer-moment-autonomous-weapons-enter-the-battlefield\">AI-enabled weaponry is booming</a>, fundamentally changing the nature of warfare. Gaza is currently a real-life testing field for some of this tech: earlier this year, one Israeli intelligence officer told the Guardian that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/03/israel-gaza-ai-database-hamas-airstrikes\">powerful AI systems</a> \u201cmade it easier\u201d to kill people and destroy homes. And while robot dogs may not be in Gaza yet, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/19/nx-s1-5195171/witnesses-say-israel-is-using-sniper-drones-in-gaza-and-theyre-shooting-civilians\">numerous eyewitnesses have said</a> that the Israeli military is using sniper drones \u2013 quadcopters with rifles attached to them \u2013 and they\u2019re shooting civilians and children.</p> <p>Are the people developing autonomous weapons kept up at night with worry about how their technology might be abused? <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/07/09/nx-s1-4985981/oculus-ai-weapons-ukraine-palmer-luckey\">Palmer Luckey</a>, the billionaire founder of <a href=\"https://www.anduril.com/\">Anduril</a>, the artificial intelligence weapons company, certainly doesn\u2019t seem to be. In a recent conversation with Pepperdine University\u2019s president, Jim Gash, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/01/palmer-luckey-every-country-needs-a-warrior-class-excited-to-enact-violence-on-others-in-pursuit-of-good-aims/\">Luckey enthused</a> about how society needs a \u201cwarrior class that is enthused and excited about enacting violence on others in pursuit of good aims\u201d. </p> <p>So this is what you should think about when you see cutesy photoshoots with robots like the one Kardashian just did. You should think about how these robots are going to be used by the self-proclaimed \u201cwarrior class\u201d. I have a feeling that we\u2019re going to see versions of Optimus being deployed to crack down on <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/riot-control-robot-can-zap-protesters-10259747\">protesters</a> well before the Tesla robots are cooking us all dinner and doing our drudge work.</p> <h2>Georgia disbands maternal mortality committee after reports of abortion ban-induced deaths</h2> <p>Georgia officials have dismissed <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/georgia-dismisses-maternal-mortality-committee-amber-thurman-candi-miller\">all members of a state committee</a> charged with investigating deaths of pregnant women.

      "bodyText": "Fresh robotic hell On a scale of one to 10, just how desperate do you think Kim Kardashian is for attention? Judging by the billionaire\u2019s weirdly sexual photoshoot with a robot, the answer may be an 11. The entrepreneur and influencer, who is a big Tesla fan, recently posed with the company\u2019s Optimus bot in a Tesla Cybercab (a self-driving taxi) for a series of photos which might be described as avant-garde if you\u2019re being polite, and dystopian thirst traps if you\u2019re not. She also posted some rather less sultry videos of her interacting with the humanoid robot. The photoshoot has ignited something of a debate online about whether Kardashian is deliberately aligning herself with Elon Musk, who runs Tesla, and outing herself as a Trump supporter. Which is a bit of a stretch really as I\u2019m not sure that \u2013 with the exception of an admirable stint working on criminal justice reform \u2013 Kardashian has ever pretended to be a leftist. Kardashian is a billionaire who has been sued for unfair labor practices and who announced, back in 2018, that she has \u201cnothing bad to say\u201d about Trump. Her Tesla-themed photoshoot was hardly a radical new direction for her. It is, however, a sign of the \u201cautonomous everything\u201d direction in which we\u2019re headed. The world\u2019s most famous influencer cozying up to a robot in a self-driving taxi is yet another example of how AI-powered autonomous technology is slowly marching into our lives. When it comes to Tesla\u2019s Optimus robot, of course, the operative word here is slowly. The robot, which isn\u2019t available for sale to the general public yet, may look flashy but it isn\u2019t clear just how sophisticated it actually is yet. The Optimus robots were a major part of Tesla\u2019s Cybercab reveal in October, serving drinks to the crowd and even chatting with them \u2013 as it turns out, however, these \u201ccutting-edge\u201d robots were actually being remotely controlled by humans. Which is a step up, I suppose, from when Musk unveiled plans for a \u201cTesla Bot\u201d in 2021 by bringing out a human in a robot suit who proceeded to breakdance to electronic music. Musk has been talking a big game about human-replacement robots for a long time, saying they\u2019re being designed to do \u201cboring, repetitious and dangerous\u201d work. The tech billionaire, who has a habit of wildly overpromising what he is capable of, also keeps telling us they\u2019re going to be released any day now. In 2021, for example, he suggested the \u201cTesla bot\u201d would launch in 2022. Earlier this year he claimed Tesla will produce \u201cgenuinely useful\u201d humanoid robots to start working in its factories next year and plans to roll them out to other companies in 2026. I wouldn\u2019t hold your breath that this will actually happen. Which is not to say, however, that development of these sorts of robots is a long way away. Robotic dogs, made by Boston Dynamics, are already being deployed by police departments and one has been guarding Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Deadlier versions of these dogs are also in the works: the US army has reportedly sent at least one \u201crobot dog\u201d armed with an artificial intelligence-enabled gun turret to Saudi Arabia for testing. More generally, military use of AI-enabled weaponry is booming, fundamentally changing the nature of warfare. Gaza is currently a real-life testing field for some of this tech: earlier this year, one Israeli intelligence officer told the Guardian that powerful AI systems \u201cmade it easier\u201d to kill people and destroy homes. And while robot dogs may not be in Gaza yet, numerous eyewitnesses have said that the Israeli military is using sniper drones \u2013 quadcopters with rifles attached to them \u2013 and they\u2019re shooting civilians and children. Are the people developing autonomous weapons kept up at night with worry about how their technology might be abused? Palmer Luckey, the billionaire founder of Anduril, the artificial intelligence weapons company, certainly doesn\u2019t seem to be. In a recent conversation with Pepperdine University\u2019s president, Jim Gash, Luckey enthused about how society needs a \u201cwarrior class that is enthused and excited about enacting violence on others in pursuit of good aims\u201d. So this is what you should think about when you see cutesy photoshoots with robots like the one Kardashian just did. You should think about how these robots are going to be used by the self-proclaimed \u201cwarrior class\u201d. I have a feeling that we\u2019re going to see versions of Optimus being deployed to crack down on protesters well before the Tesla robots are cooking us all dinner and doing our drudge work. Georgia disbands maternal mortality committee after reports of abortion ban-induced deaths Georgia officials have dismissed all members of a state committee charged with investigating deaths of pregnant women. Why? Because ProPublica did a little investigating itself and, back in September, got hold of internal documents which found Amber Thurman and Candi Miller died preventable deaths as a result of a state abortion ban. Nancy Mace is obsessed with where Sarah McBride goes to the bathroom McBride recently became the first openly transgender person to be elected to the US House of Representatives. Cue vicious bullying from her future colleagues. This week the South Carolina representative Nancy Mace filed a motion to ban McBride and other trans women from women\u2019s bathrooms in the Capitol. \u201cIf you think this bill is about protecting women and not simply a ploy to get on Fox News, you\u2019ve been fooled,\u201d wrote Natalie Johnson, Mace\u2019s former communications director.

      "bodyText": "One of the bad things that comes with being a middle-aged interviewer, as opposed to a younger one, is the tendency to complain loudly that people in public life used to be so much less controlled, so much more wild and free and apt to say the wrong (the interesting) thing. No one likes a nostalgist, after all. But in the case of politicians, I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s no getting away from it. In 2024, unbridled they aren\u2019t. Every word is rehearsed. Even their sandwich fillings have been focus-grouped. When I heard the sad news that John Prescott had died, I was filled with nostalgia, and not only for my youth. In the pantheon of my former interviewees, he began somewhere around the middle: not as juicy as Gore Vidal, but more fascinating (honestly!) than Tom Jones. As the years went by, however, something happened. He began to rise ever upwards, to a point where I now think of him as in the top 10. If Peter Mandelson divulged his character to me in the gentle nibbling of a Pret a Manger tiffin bar \u2013 with what ruthless delicacy he munched! \u2013 I located Prescott\u2019s sweet, sad soul in the simple words: \u201cBlimmin\u2019 Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s trifles.\u201d The year was 2008, and the former deputy prime minister had just published his memoirs, a book whose central revelation was that he\u2019d suffered from bulimia, which brought him to binge on supermarket trifles (he and his wife, Pauline, liked the best things in life, and so they were M&amp;S). We talked about this a lot \u2013 the subject fascinated him \u2013 and what he said was unexpected as well as comical. Once we\u2019d got past his fury at the ignorance of journalists \u2013 \u201cthey said I\u2019d failed because I was still fat!\u201d \u2013 we arrived at the kind of male vanity that always touches me, fool that I am. It was, he said, great to no longer be bulimic: his face had stopped blowing up \u201clike Les Dawson\u2019s\u201d. Who had aged better? I asked. Him or Tony Blair? \u201cOh, I think I have,\u201d he replied, quick as a flash. Later, he pulled a plastic comb from his pocket, and attended to his hair. This, I understood, was his way of consoling himself for myriad snubs and slights, among them the fact that Blair had invited him to Chequers only twice. Some of this may not sound to your ears especially uninhibited, for all that it\u2019s revealing \u2013 though you\u2019ve probably never tried to get Yvette Cooper to talk like a human being. But in truth, the moment of zero restraint had occurred right at the start of our meeting. In Prescott\u2019s gloomy House of Commons office were two armchairs arranged around a table, on which there was a model of a hand grenade with a sign that read: \u201cComplaints department.

      "bodyText": "A gang of masked men broke into the home of a woman who had taken a civil case against the mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor that accused him of raping her, it can now be revealed. The incident was referred to at the start of the court case in Dublin but could not be reported until now as it emerged during legal discussion while the jury were not present. On Friday, a jury in the high court of Ireland found that McGregor had in December 2018 assaulted Nikita Hand, who had accused him of raping her, and awarded damages of nearly \u20ac250,000 (\u00a3208,000) in her favour. The court heard that unknown masked men had broken into her home, smashed the windows and stabbed her boyfriend on 14 June. Hand\u2019s counsel, John Gordon, told Judge Owens that he was not suggesting the fighter was behind the attack but that it went some way to explain her anxiety and why she relocated from her home. \u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s home was invaded by a group of men wearing balaclavas,\u201d he said. \u201cThe broke into the plaintiff\u2019s bedroom, and were driven out by the plaintiff\u2019s partner, who suffered a stab wound in the process.

The judge ruled that he considered it to be \u201ccompletely irrelevant and shouldn\u2019t be referred to\u201d. A Garda spokesperson confirmed it had received a report of an incident of aggravated burglary and that investigations were ongoing. They added that a man had received hospital treatment for \u201cnon life-threatening injuries\u201d. On Friday, McGregor, who denied Hand\u2019s claims as lies and fabrication designed to cover up cheating on her boyfriend, said he was appealing against the high court decision, noting that the damages award was \u201cmodest\u201d. He said: \u201cThe judge\u2019s instruction and the modest award given was for assault, not for aggravated or exemplary damages. I am disappointed that the jury did not hear all the evidence that the DPP [Ireland\u2019s director of public prosecutions] reviewed. I am with my family now, focused on my future. Thank you to all my support worldwide,\u201d he said on X. The DPP decided not to pursue the case in 2020 on the grounds that there was not a reasonable prospect of securing a conviction. McGregor had faced an accusation that he \u201cbrutally raped and battered\u201d Hand at a hotel in south Dublin in December 2018. The Irish sports star previously told the court he had consensual sex with Hand in a penthouse at the Beacon hotel. The Dublin Rape Crisis Centre said the case was an important moment in establishing what \u201cconsent\u201d meant after the judge made it clear in his closing comments to the jury that \u201csubmission\u201d was not consent, nor was risky behaviour. Drinking or taking drugs \u201cdoes not mean they are up for sex\u201d, Owens said. Ireland\u2019s justice minister, Helen McEntee, commended Hand for her \u201cbravery and determination\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Much has happened since England and Eddie Jones last crossed samurai swords in a sweltering Tokyo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/22/japan-england-rugby-union-international-match-report\">at the end of June</a>. England have not had another Test match victory in the intervening 155 days and red rose morale has taken a series of hits. Five consecutive losses is in danger of prompting confidence and momentum to drift away among players and fans alike.</p> <p>Japan, coincidentally, have also endured a lean spell since conceding 52 points to England. Italy and Fiji topped 40 points against them, a reshuffled France side rattled up 52 and New Zealand scored 64 in Yokohama. Last week\u2019s 36-20 win over Uruguay delivered some respite, but Jones\u2019s second coming as Japanese head coach is proving a slow burn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/20/england-adjusting-tom-currys-technique-to-ensure-safety-after-latest-concussion\">England adjusting Tom Curry\u2019s technique to ensure safety after latest concussion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maybe it just proves what Steve Borthwick keeps saying: that international rugby is about incremental progress and fine margins rather than vertical graphs and instant giant strides. Or is that just the set text coaches recite when they\u2019re losing? Look at how Joe Schmidt is transforming the basket case of a Wallaby team he inherited from Jones less than 12 months ago.</p> <p>It makes the final international of England\u2019s hitherto blank November an intriguing one psychologically. If they win by plenty it will not greatly change public perceptions. If the margin is relatively close it will be seen as further evidence of English fragility rather than Japanese improvement. In other words, the lasting autumn damage has already been done.</p> <p>That does not mean, however, that England have nothing left to play for. Quite the opposite. By not rotating his side \u2013 how instructive it would have been to see whether players such as Ted Hill, Cadan Murley, Alex Lozowski, Luke Northmore or Trevor Davidson could have made an impact \u2013 Borthwick has invited some familiar faces to right a few wrongs in the name of continuity. If the home team show more consistent zest, not least in the final quarter, this might yet be a fixture that reboots a few careers and, potentially, the whole Borthwick&nbsp;regime.</p> <p>In particular, it would be lovely to hear the TV commentators \u2013 and TNT, for those who have been watching, has been doing a good job \u2013 mention one specific word more often. While Borthwick would settle for a three-letter word beginning with a W, there has been a frequent omission under his tutelage and, with apologies to Tammy Wynette, it is spelt O-F-F-L-O-A-D.</p> <p>In their past five defeats against New Zealand (three times), Australia and South Africa, the opposition have offloaded the ball 50 times. England\u2019s tally is a measly 20. Other areas need improvement, from defence to set-piece dominance, but the ability to work a defence slightly harder and shift the point of attack at the last moment is an increasingly vital skill for leading sides.</p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/09/england-australia-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union-match-report\">Australia\u2019s last-gasp winning try</a> a fortnight ago was a classic example and even the glee with which Len Ikitau threw his final backdoor offload to Max Jorgensen was instructive. Test rugby cannot always be a fun factory but players, particularly backs, who are enjoying and expressing themselves tend to play better. A free-spirited Marcus Smith being the perfect case study.</p> <p>There also seems to be truth in the argument that England\u2019s rush defence works better against average teams than against better opponents with the dexterity, pace, awareness and skill to get around it more often. The game, as Borthwick noted on Friday, is getting faster and is also rewarding a more balanced kicking strategy. Statistically England are averaging just four passes for every kick, the lowest ratio in the Autumn Nations Series. They are also averaging the most kicks per game with 29. In terms of results, none of this has borne a huge amount of fruit.</p> <p>The figures are not great on line breaks, either, with England\u2019s opponents averaging more than nine per game. Worse, missed tackles are costing them a higher ratio of tries than other teams, which suggests their scramble defence also needs improving. In many ways, England\u2019s primary challenge against Japan is not how many points they score but how few they concede.</p> <p>It is more complicated than just falling off a couple of tackles. In their five defeats England have held the lead in the final quarter and let it slip every time. In four of those games, the exception being the helter-skelter defeat by Australia, England failed to score a point in the last 20 minutes. Is that a mental thing or more fitness related? The evidence is not entirely conclusive. While Borthwick has been suggesting his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/17/steve-borthwick-claims-players-not-fit-enough-for-test-rugby-after-south-africa-loss\">squad were not fit enough</a> at the start of the autumn, Ellis Genge said less than a month ago he was achieving new levels in the gym.</p> <p>Japan, meanwhile, will miss their suspended lock Warner Dearns and have only seven survivors from the side that last faced England. There will also be a markedly different feel to the contest played in the 30C heat of Tokyo just over five months ago. Their \u201cgo faster\u201d style of rugby, known as <em>Chosoku</em>, remains an ambition and they can certainly offload when the mood takes them. The wing Jone Naikabula, scorer of an excellent early try against the All Blacks in Yokohama, is one to watch but the golden generation who saw off South Africa in the 2015 World Cup pool stages have moved on.</p>    <p>So what will Borthwick and Jones be thinking when they shake hands?

      "bodyText": "Much has happened since England and Eddie Jones last crossed samurai swords in a sweltering Tokyo at the end of June. England have not had another Test match victory in the intervening 155 days and red rose morale has taken a series of hits. Five consecutive losses is in danger of prompting confidence and momentum to drift away among players and fans alike. Japan, coincidentally, have also endured a lean spell since conceding 52 points to England. Italy and Fiji topped 40 points against them, a reshuffled France side rattled up 52 and New Zealand scored 64 in Yokohama. Last week\u2019s 36-20 win over Uruguay delivered some respite, but Jones\u2019s second coming as Japanese head coach is proving a slow burn. Maybe it just proves what Steve Borthwick keeps saying: that international rugby is about incremental progress and fine margins rather than vertical graphs and instant giant strides. Or is that just the set text coaches recite when they\u2019re losing? Look at how Joe Schmidt is transforming the basket case of a Wallaby team he inherited from Jones less than 12 months ago. It makes the final international of England\u2019s hitherto blank November an intriguing one psychologically. If they win by plenty it will not greatly change public perceptions. If the margin is relatively close it will be seen as further evidence of English fragility rather than Japanese improvement. In other words, the lasting autumn damage has already been done. That does not mean, however, that England have nothing left to play for. Quite the opposite. By not rotating his side \u2013 how instructive it would have been to see whether players such as Ted Hill, Cadan Murley, Alex Lozowski, Luke Northmore or Trevor Davidson could have made an impact \u2013 Borthwick has invited some familiar faces to right a few wrongs in the name of continuity. If the home team show more consistent zest, not least in the final quarter, this might yet be a fixture that reboots a few careers and, potentially, the whole Borthwick regime. In particular, it would be lovely to hear the TV commentators \u2013 and TNT, for those who have been watching, has been doing a good job \u2013 mention one specific word more often. While Borthwick would settle for a three-letter word beginning with a W, there has been a frequent omission under his tutelage and, with apologies to Tammy Wynette, it is spelt O-F-F-L-O-A-D. In their past five defeats against New Zealand (three times), Australia and South Africa, the opposition have offloaded the ball 50 times. England\u2019s tally is a measly 20. Other areas need improvement, from defence to set-piece dominance, but the ability to work a defence slightly harder and shift the point of attack at the last moment is an increasingly vital skill for leading sides. Australia\u2019s last-gasp winning try a fortnight ago was a classic example and even the glee with which Len Ikitau threw his final backdoor offload to Max Jorgensen was instructive. Test rugby cannot always be a fun factory but players, particularly backs, who are enjoying and expressing themselves tend to play better. A free-spirited Marcus Smith being the perfect case study. There also seems to be truth in the argument that England\u2019s rush defence works better against average teams than against better opponents with the dexterity, pace, awareness and skill to get around it more often. The game, as Borthwick noted on Friday, is getting faster and is also rewarding a more balanced kicking strategy. Statistically England are averaging just four passes for every kick, the lowest ratio in the Autumn Nations Series. They are also averaging the most kicks per game with 29. In terms of results, none of this has borne a huge amount of fruit. The figures are not great on line breaks, either, with England\u2019s opponents averaging more than nine per game. Worse, missed tackles are costing them a higher ratio of tries than other teams, which suggests their scramble defence also needs improving. In many ways, England\u2019s primary challenge against Japan is not how many points they score but how few they concede. It is more complicated than just falling off a couple of tackles. In their five defeats England have held the lead in the final quarter and let it slip every time. In four of those games, the exception being the helter-skelter defeat by Australia, England failed to score a point in the last 20 minutes. Is that a mental thing or more fitness related? The evidence is not entirely conclusive. While Borthwick has been suggesting his squad were not fit enough at the start of the autumn, Ellis Genge said less than a month ago he was achieving new levels in the gym. Japan, meanwhile, will miss their suspended lock Warner Dearns and have only seven survivors from the side that last faced England. There will also be a markedly different feel to the contest played in the 30C heat of Tokyo just over five months ago. Their \u201cgo faster\u201d style of rugby, known as Chosoku, remains an ambition and they can certainly offload when the mood takes them. The wing Jone Naikabula, scorer of an excellent early try against the All Blacks in Yokohama, is one to watch but the golden generation who saw off South Africa in the 2015 World Cup pool stages have moved on. So what will Borthwick and Jones be thinking when they shake hands? The old master-and-apprentice scenario has been superseded by more basic instincts. Borthwick wants a win; Jones, who has been unwell this past week, will not want his face on the big screen unless Japan are causing their hosts some problems. While the Aussie ninja warrior would love to make his former employers\u2019 autumn even more uncomfortable it can only be hoped England fans show him suitable courtesy and respect. A competitive spectacle would also remind the Rugby Football Union\u2019s executives that sacking one conductor does not necessarily transform an entire orchestra. Are England in better shape than they were before Jones\u2019s removal? Or, in terms of on-field improvement, has there been no real discernible change? For those at the sharp end this fixture will feel anything but an afterthought.",

As famously \u201cboobalicious\u201d as Didion was famously thin, Babitz was at the center of the wild 60s LA scene that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2021/dec/23/literary-legend-joan-didion-a-stylish-life-in-pictures\">Didion</a> captured in her 1979 book The White Album. She dated multiple men who championed Didion\u2019s work, while Didion helped Babitz publish her first Rolling Stone article and edit her first book. Didion profiled Jim Morrison, calling him one of the \u201cmissionaries of apocalyptic sex\u201d. Babitz actually had sex with him.</p>    <p>The women\u2019s relationship was a fraught one, and when Babitz died, she left behind boxes full of unsent letters, including one to Didion \u2013 a letter that is simultaneously furious and enamored, attacking how Didion performed her role as an acclaimed female journalist, and the dynamics of her marriage to John Gregory Dunne, a less successful writer.</p> <p>\u201cCould you write what you do if you weren\u2019t so tiny, Joan?\u201d Babitz asked in the unsent 1972 letter. \u201cWould you be allowed to if you weren\u2019t physically so unthreatening? Would the balance of power between you and John have collapsed long ago if it weren\u2019t that he regards you a lot of the time as a child so it\u2019s all right that you are famous. And you yourself keep making it more all right because you are always referring to your size.\u201d</p> <p>Didion, who had recently published a takedown of the women\u2019s movement, had told Babitz that she did not like Virginia Woolf\u2019s diaries. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely about you that you can\u2019t stand her diaries. It goes with Sacramento,\u201d Babitz wrote. \u201cYou prefer to be with the boys snickering at the silly women and writing accurate prose.\u201d</p> <p>Lili Anolik, the journalist and Babitz biographer who discovered the unsent letter, has turned it into the heart of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/13/didion-babitz-by-lili-anolik-review-friendship-and-rivalry-in-la\">new dual biography</a>, Didion and Babitz. The book is a meditation on what it takes for a woman to become a famous writer \u2013 and an examination of just how ugly and messy a literary career like Didion\u2019s, or a party girl life like Babitz\u2019s, can look behind the scenes.</p> <p>It\u2019s also a takedown of Didion, portraying her as calculating and brutally careerist, and examining just how much of Didion\u2019s fame as a chronicler of 60s counter-culture relied on her <a href=\"https://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/103/didion-per-harrison.html\">upper-middle-class social position</a>, and the series of well-connected men who championed and protected her.</p>    <p>Anolik interviews the right-leaning political journalist Noel Parmentel, Didion\u2019s charismatic lover in New York, who helped get Didion\u2019s first novel published but would not marry her. Parmentel describes essentially arranging the famous literary marriage between her and Dunne, who was, he said, \u201cnot brilliant, but bright\u201d, and, unlike him, willing to \u201cbe at the breakfast table every morning\u201d and \u201cedit her line by line\u201d.</p> <p>Anolik was drawn to the contrast between Didion, the \u201ccontrolled, eyes-on-the-prize\u201d former sorority girl, and Babitz, a \u201cwalk-on-the-wild-side type\u201d who was \u201cemotionally sloppy but morally courageous\u201d, as she told me in a recent interview.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/13/didion-babitz-by-lili-anolik-review-friendship-and-rivalry-in-la\">Didion &amp; Babitz by Lili Anolik review \u2013 friendship and rivalry in LA</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhat I like about Joan is how extremely she wanted to be a great writer, more than she wanted anything else,\u201d Anolik said. \u201cIf I expose anything, or reveal anything, it\u2019s to understand the price she paid to be Joan Didion.\u201d</p> <p>Babitz was much less strategic in how she operated. \u201cShe made everything impossible for herself. She made it so hard,\u201d Anolik said. Often, Babitz did things that made Anolik think: \u201cEve, that\u2019s so fucking stupid \u2013 dont\u2019 call yourself a groupie\u201d and give people \u201cammunition to dismiss you\u201d. (Didion\u2019s husband called Babitz \u201cthe dowager groupie\u201d.)</p> <p>When Babitz\u2019s books were originally published in the 70s, they didn\u2019t get much attention. By the early 80s, when Didion had cemented her fame with The White Album, Babitz was dealing with a cocaine addiction and eventually had to move back in with her mother. In her later decades, she struggled with Huntington\u2019s disease and a terrible accident that left most of her body covered with painful burns.</p> <p>Anolik is unapologetically on Babitz\u2019s side, the champion of a once-forgotten writer she helped restore to the canon with a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2014/03/eve-babitz-los-angeles-party-scene?srsltid=AfmBOopC9y-YMggk2zznB0FUj00-gi0QYv1hT_qaNbJW3wUpp69GvxQ9\">2014 Vanity Fair profile</a>, portraying Babitz as an \u201cirresistible hybrid of boho intellectual and LA party girl\u201d.</p>    <p>Though she lived in LA for <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-05-09-vw-1725-story.html\">24 years</a>, Didion took the stereotypical serious person\u2019s view of the city, as \u201ca spiritually starved place full of glamorous and empty people\u201d, Anolik told me. But Babitz, who thought she would never be treated as \u201ca major important serious author\u201d, refused to do that: \u201cI\u2019m a gossip storyteller who likes LA rather than hates it,\u201d Babitz wrote in one of her letters. Unlike Didion, Babitz was actually from Los Angeles, and had gone to Hollywood high school, the inspiration for her first book.</p> <p>After Anolik\u2019s profile, Babitz\u2019s literary career belatedly took off. Her books were reissued by NYRB Classics, with introductions from a series of young journalists who claimed Babitz as one of their own, falling in love with her blunt, confident, over-sharing prose, which can feel much more current than Didion\u2019s postured mid-century malaise.</p> <p>When I moved to Los Angeles at the height of the pandemic, Babitz was one of the first LA writers people urged me to pick up. Reading Eve\u2019s Hollywood during those months of isolation made me feel like I was cruising through the streets with a brilliant, fast-talking, gloriously petty local. More than one California art girl I know has decorated her bathroom with the iconic Julian Wasser photograph of a nude Babitz, at age 20, playing chess with Marcel Duchamp. (Anolik notes that Babitz engineered the photograph as revenge against her lover at the time, an art curator who did not invite her to an important opening.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/17/didion-babitz-by-lili-anolik-review-the-seductress-and-the-sphinx-joan-didion-eve-babitz\">Didion &amp; Babitz by Lili Anolik review \u2013the seductress and the sphinx</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Neither Didion nor Babitz\u2019s books offer much today in terms of revealing political analysis, though Didion, who was always something of a political reactionary, is certainly a better writer than the journalists satirizing woke-ism today.</p> <p>Other famous local authors \u2013 like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/30/mike-davis-california-writer-interview-activism\">leftist historian Mike Davis</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/23/nikki-high-octavias-bookshelf-pasadena-california\">speculative fiction writer Octavia Butler</a> \u2013 understood California more deeply, and produced books that still feel \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2024/01/13/octavia-butler-2024-parable-sower/\">eerily accurate</a>\u201d, even \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/30/mike-davis-california-writer-interview-activism\">prophetic</a>\u201d of the conflicts Los Angeles is facing now.</p> <p>But Didion and Babitz\u2019s stylish self-mythologizing remains relevant, the precursor to the social media streams of gen Z women invoking not a full \u201cmental breakdown\u201d, but a diminutive \u201cmenty b\u201d.</p>    <p>Some of the details about the two writers\u2019 fast times in LA are delightfully absurd: before he made it in the movies, Harrison Ford was a pot dealer, and then Didion\u2019s carpenter at her house in Malibu. Ford was, reportedly, not a very diligent craftsman, but according to Babitz, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2014/03/eve-babitz-los-angeles-party-scene?srsltid=AfmBOopC9y-YMggk2zznB0FUj00-gi0QYv1hT_qaNbJW3wUpp69GvxQ9\">who knew</a>: \u201cThe thing about Harrison was Harrison could fuck.\u201d</p> <p>Others are sadder, like Babitz\u2019s constant anxiety about her weight, including her belief that Mick Jagger did not like her because he thought she was fat, and Didion\u2019s intense, meticulously controlled thinness. Despite cooking elaborate meals for other people and touting her culinary skills, Didion \u201callowed herself no flesh\u201d, Anolik writes.</p> <p>Didion and Babitz died six days apart in December 2021: \u201cI want to believe that Joan Didion lived an extra week out of spite so she could officially outlive Eve Babitz,\u201d one journalist wrote in a viral tweet at the time.</p> <p>Critics <a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/fitful-glimpses-and-spurts/\">have had</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/13/didion-babitz-by-lili-anolik-review-friendship-and-rivalry-in-la\">mixed</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/17/didion-babitz-by-lili-anolik-review-the-seductress-and-the-sphinx-joan-didion-eve-babitz\">responses</a> to Didion and Babitz. Not all readers will be compelled by a 1960s story about two white women fighting for literary recognition while Watts burns somewhere in the background. Several reviewers have said they were particularly unconvinced by Anolik\u2019s argument that the two writers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/13/didion-babitz-by-lili-anolik-review-friendship-and-rivalry-in-la\">represent</a> the \u201ctwo halves of American womanhood\u201d.</p> <p>But the Hollywood buzz around the book has been undeniable. The actor Emma Roberts chose Didion and Babitz for her book club, and she hosted a launch party for the book early this month at Chateau Marmont, the setting of so many of Eve\u2019s stories. There were bouquets of cigarettes and lighters printed with Didion and Babitz\u2019s names. Celebrities from Oscar-winner Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph to Elizabeth Olsen to Nicole Richie took turns reading some of Babitz\u2019s letters aloud.</p> <p>It was a very particular kind of seance. Three years after her death, Babitz\u2019s one-liners were once again echoing through the old Hollywood hotel, now in the voices of a series of young actresses. Didion might have won most of the laurels. But it\u2019s possible that, on their friendship, Babitz was getting the last word.</p>",

Parmentel describes essentially arranging the famous literary marriage between her and Dunne, who was, he said, \u201cnot brilliant, but bright\u201d, and, unlike him, willing to \u201cbe at the breakfast table every morning\u201d and \u201cedit her line by line\u201d. Anolik was drawn to the contrast between Didion, the \u201ccontrolled, eyes-on-the-prize\u201d former sorority girl, and Babitz, a \u201cwalk-on-the-wild-side type\u201d who was \u201cemotionally sloppy but morally courageous\u201d, as she told me in a recent interview. \u201cWhat I like about Joan is how extremely she wanted to be a great writer, more than she wanted anything else,\u201d Anolik said. \u201cIf I expose anything, or reveal anything, it\u2019s to understand the price she paid to be Joan Didion.\u201d Babitz was much less strategic in how she operated. \u201cShe made everything impossible for herself. She made it so hard,\u201d Anolik said. Often, Babitz did things that made Anolik think: \u201cEve, that\u2019s so fucking stupid \u2013 dont\u2019 call yourself a groupie\u201d and give people \u201cammunition to dismiss you\u201d. (Didion\u2019s husband called Babitz \u201cthe dowager groupie\u201d.) When Babitz\u2019s books were originally published in the 70s, they didn\u2019t get much attention. By the early 80s, when Didion had cemented her fame with The White Album, Babitz was dealing with a cocaine addiction and eventually had to move back in with her mother. In her later decades, she struggled with Huntington\u2019s disease and a terrible accident that left most of her body covered with painful burns. Anolik is unapologetically on Babitz\u2019s side, the champion of a once-forgotten writer she helped restore to the canon with a 2014 Vanity Fair profile, portraying Babitz as an \u201cirresistible hybrid of boho intellectual and LA party girl\u201d. Though she lived in LA for 24 years, Didion took the stereotypical serious person\u2019s view of the city, as \u201ca spiritually starved place full of glamorous and empty people\u201d, Anolik told me. But Babitz, who thought she would never be treated as \u201ca major important serious author\u201d, refused to do that: \u201cI\u2019m a gossip storyteller who likes LA rather than hates it,\u201d Babitz wrote in one of her letters. Unlike Didion, Babitz was actually from Los Angeles, and had gone to Hollywood high school, the inspiration for her first book. After Anolik\u2019s profile, Babitz\u2019s literary career belatedly took off. Her books were reissued by NYRB Classics, with introductions from a series of young journalists who claimed Babitz as one of their own, falling in love with her blunt, confident, over-sharing prose, which can feel much more current than Didion\u2019s postured mid-century malaise. When I moved to Los Angeles at the height of the pandemic, Babitz was one of the first LA writers people urged me to pick up. Reading Eve\u2019s Hollywood during those months of isolation made me feel like I was cruising through the streets with a brilliant, fast-talking, gloriously petty local. More than one California art girl I know has decorated her bathroom with the iconic Julian Wasser photograph of a nude Babitz, at age 20, playing chess with Marcel Duchamp. (Anolik notes that Babitz engineered the photograph as revenge against her lover at the time, an art curator who did not invite her to an important opening.) Neither Didion nor Babitz\u2019s books offer much today in terms of revealing political analysis, though Didion, who was always something of a political reactionary, is certainly a better writer than the journalists satirizing woke-ism today. Other famous local authors \u2013 like the leftist historian Mike Davis or the speculative fiction writer Octavia Butler \u2013 understood California more deeply, and produced books that still feel \u201ceerily accurate\u201d, even \u201cprophetic\u201d of the conflicts Los Angeles is facing now. But Didion and Babitz\u2019s stylish self-mythologizing remains relevant, the precursor to the social media streams of gen Z women invoking not a full \u201cmental breakdown\u201d, but a diminutive \u201cmenty b\u201d. Some of the details about the two writers\u2019 fast times in LA are delightfully absurd: before he made it in the movies, Harrison Ford was a pot dealer, and then Didion\u2019s carpenter at her house in Malibu. Ford was, reportedly, not a very diligent craftsman, but according to Babitz, who knew: \u201cThe thing about Harrison was Harrison could fuck.\u201d Others are sadder, like Babitz\u2019s constant anxiety about her weight, including her belief that Mick Jagger did not like her because he thought she was fat, and Didion\u2019s intense, meticulously controlled thinness. Despite cooking elaborate meals for other people and touting her culinary skills, Didion \u201callowed herself no flesh\u201d, Anolik writes. Didion and Babitz died six days apart in December 2021: \u201cI want to believe that Joan Didion lived an extra week out of spite so she could officially outlive Eve Babitz,\u201d one journalist wrote in a viral tweet at the time. Critics have had mixed responses to Didion and Babitz. Not all readers will be compelled by a 1960s story about two white women fighting for literary recognition while Watts burns somewhere in the background. Several reviewers have said they were particularly unconvinced by Anolik\u2019s argument that the two writers represent the \u201ctwo halves of American womanhood\u201d. But the Hollywood buzz around the book has been undeniable. The actor Emma Roberts chose Didion and Babitz for her book club, and she hosted a launch party for the book early this month at Chateau Marmont, the setting of so many of Eve\u2019s stories. There were bouquets of cigarettes and lighters printed with Didion and Babitz\u2019s names. Celebrities from Oscar-winner Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph to Elizabeth Olsen to Nicole Richie took turns reading some of Babitz\u2019s letters aloud. It was a very particular kind of seance. Three years after her death, Babitz\u2019s one-liners were once again echoing through the old Hollywood hotel, now in the voices of a series of young actresses. Didion might have won most of the laurels. But it\u2019s possible that, on their friendship, Babitz was getting the last word.",

It\u2019s important to say that I\u2019m not defending the corporations or current proprietors of the internet, but I do think that moral panic over the net will lead to regulation that will affect freedoms for all.

What separates this media moral panic from others is the conflict of interest involved: in the media\u2019s view, this new technology competes with them for both audience and advertising dollars \u2013 and that is rarely revealed. In my book, I chronicle the failures of Rupert Murdoch on the internet and the billions of dollars that he wasted. He decided to turn on it because he couldn\u2019t succeed at it.

When we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/13/smartphones-are-bad-for-kids-we-dont-need-to-call-on-scientific-data-to-know-it\">blame the phone for young people\u2019s problems</a>, we once again pass over the much more serious issues. In the US, children are afraid to go to school for [fear of] getting shot. Young women evermore have no control over their bodies. They are inheriting a climate that we fucked up. They are in the midst of a fascist takeover of the country. Oh yeah, let\u2019s blame the phones.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your take on AI?<br></strong>I\u2019m more frightened of the AI boys than I am of their AI. The problem is they have corrupted the language around it, so the word \u201csafety\u201d is now meaningless because the doomsters treat safety as them not destroying humankind, when there are very real safety issues that need to be dealt with around bias and fraud and the environment and so on. So it\u2019s difficult to have the conversation now because we don\u2019t have common terms.</p> <p><strong>What impact will the Trump administration have on regulation \u2013 and more broadly on your vision for reclaiming the internet?<br></strong>I think you\u2019re going to find the companies themselves not regulated, unless Donald Trump doesn\u2019t like them.

No one wants to make judgments because it\u2019s expensive and risky to do so. On the one hand, we\u2019ll find companies and investors run wild. On the other, we will see some vindictive action from the Trumpists against certain companies because they have this belief that they\u2019ve been discriminated against.</p> <p><strong>Are you surprised by how far to the right certain Silicon Valley billionaires have leaned?<br></strong>I think one shouldn\u2019t be surprised about the corrupting venality of billions of dollars and I think that\u2019s what we saw at work in some of those cases. The argument that I heard during the election was: \u201cWell, maybe the moguls have gone to the right, but the workers have not.\u201d I don\u2019t know. It wasn\u2019t that long ago when employees at Google revolted over machine learning and defence.

So I don\u2019t know where the pulse of Silicon Valley will be, and I fear that it could go farther right all around or farther into a safety cave.</p>    <p><strong>Do you think Trump\u2019s relationship with Elon Musk will go the distance?<br></strong>[laughs] God knows. It\u2019s often said that they both want centre stage, so this won\u2019t work, but Trump loves billionaires and crazy, outlandish talk. And Musk, obviously, loves being at the centre of power. His investment in Twitter seemed insane, and it certainly was damaging, but it gave him this power, and this power led to Tesla stock going up. So it probably turned out to be a good investment \u2013 in ruining America.

He will have a much more lenient and malleable landscape, as Republicans control both the House and the Senate, and there is a conservative majority in the supreme court. Tom Homan, whom Trump has selected as his \u201cborder czar\u201d, has said that the public can expect \u201c<a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/shock-awe-trump-border-czar-tom-homan-plans/story?id=115972346\">shock and awe</a>\u201d on Trump\u2019s first day in office. Under the second Trump administration, the number of refugees entering the country could dwindle.</p> <p>As such, organizations are working to ensure that they will be able to protect and assist the individuals and families that their groups serve come January. Emily Laney, executive director of the Welcome Co-op, a non-profit in Atlanta, said that the organization came into existence during \u201cthe last time resettlement was facing uncertainty\u201d during Trump\u2019s first term in office.

Nearly <a href=\"https://map.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/locations/georgia/\">11% of Georgia\u2019s population</a> are immigrants and, under the Biden administration, the state settled the third-largest number of refugees. Still, both Biden\u2019s and Trump\u2019s administrations also deported large numbers of immigrants.</p> <p>Refugee Women\u2019s Network (RWN), the only organization in Georgia that specifically serves refugee women, is preparing to aid as many women as possible, while retaining staff, no matter the change in administration, according to Sushma Barakoti, the group\u2019s executive director. Currently, RWN is raising funds to sustain it through four years of the Trump administration.</p> <p>During Trump\u2019s first administration, some refugee agencies were forced to undergo significant job cuts and, in some cases, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/20/politics/refugee-resettlement/index.html\">totally shutter</a> due to a lack of funding. Barakoti said that RWN was hoping that small grants and donations can make up enough funding so that the organization does not have to lay off staff in the event of dwindling numbers of refugees entering the country.</p> <p>She said that the organization had had an opportunity to frankly discuss the situation with supporters after the election.</p> <p>\u201cWe had over 200 people there,\u201d she said. \u201cWe did talk about the uncertainty that the next administration brings to the refugee and immigrant programs.

      "body": "<p>A shiny new tractor is pulling a huge orange trailer, while a commentator explains how best to manoeuvre it to tip grain, watched by a group of farmers wrapped up warmly in wellies, coats and bobble hats, some holding spaniels on leads.</p> <p>Others are checking out the latest models of combine harvesters and crop sprayers, parked on snowy ground at the Midlands Machinery Show, but few seem to be buying, and the changes to inheritance tax for agricultural properties <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/01/farmers-shocked-budget-inheritance-tax-estates\">announced in Rachel Reeves\u2019s October budget</a> are never far from anyone\u2019s lips.</p> <p>On a crisp and sunny November day, the mood at one of the UK\u2019s largest agricultural machinery shows was anything but bright.</p> <p>A frosty chill has also descended on the network of companies dependent on farm businesses purveying their wares in Newark. Machinery manufacturers and dealers, as well as building companies and suppliers, have a similar refrain: customers stopped calling straight after the chancellor set out the budget measures affecting the agricultural sector.</p>    <p>\u201cThe phone got a lot quieter from the second she [Reeves] announced it,\u201d says Jonathan Richardson, sales manager at Browns of Wem, a Shropshire-based company which designs, makes and constructs steel-framed and timber-sectioned buildings. \u201cIt\u2019s had the quickest impact we have ever seen.\u201d</p> <p>Previously, farming businesses qualified for 100% relief on inheritance tax on agricultural and business property. However, budget changes will see the tax imposed on farms worth over \u00a31m, with an effective rate of 20% on assets above that threshold, rather than the normal 40% rate for inheritance tax. Labour has said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/19/what-are-inheritance-tax-changes-affecting-uk-farmers\">farms worth \u00a33m could end up being exempt</a>, as married couples can each claim \u00a31m tax-free, in addition to a family home worth up to \u00a31m. </p> <p>\u201cPeople tend to ring us in the first instance when they start thinking about [a new building]: those calls have stopped,\u201d Richardson says, on the company\u2019s stand at the Newark show, flanked by photos of farm buildings erected by the firm.</p> <p>Any belt-tightening and deferral of purchases by farmers would have a big effect on Browns of Wem, which depends on agricultural businesses for at least 90% of its trade. It would also send shockwaves through the network of companies \u2013 selling every\u00adthing from tractors to tyres and farm gates to fertiliser \u2013 which make up the rural economy.</p> <p>\u201cWe are OK, we have a decent order book, but it is a lot quieter than it was,\u201d says Richardson. \u201cWe are hoping this is just a blip and confidence will recover.\u201d</p> <p>Taking place a day after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/19/farmers-betrayed-by-ministers-says-union-head-before-london-protest\">thousands of farmers and landowners protested against the budget measures on the streets of London,</a> signs propped on one display tractor warn \u201cDon\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you\u201d and \u201cSave a farmer, remove Starmer\u201d, underlining the strength of feeling in the farming community.</p>    <p>The Treasury is understood to be assessing the impact of inheritance tax changes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/nov/21/farmers-aged-80-could-get-exemption-inheritance-tax-rule\">including amending gifting rules for over-80s</a>, which could allow them to pass on their farm to their heirs tax-free without having to live for seven years after making the gift. Officials are also understood to be assessing the impact of budget measures on active small and medium-sized farms compared with smallholdings. </p> <p>Some of the largest machines on display, such as massive tractors and combine harvesters, are manufactured abroad and shipped to the UK to be sold by networks of dealers.</p> <p>\u201cWe are a dying breed, UK manufacturers,\u201d says Graham Cherry, sitting inside a warm show stand, looking at the agricultural material handling equipment made by his company, Cherry Products, displayed outside in the snow.</p> <p>Their machinery attachments \u2013 including pallet forks, grain lifters and snowploughs \u2013 sell for between \u00a32,000 and \u00a38,000. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are selling, and those selling \u00a3100,000 tractors are struggling,\u201d he says, pointing at a nearby stand.</p> <p>\u201cTo survive, we need profitable farmers in the UK who will invest,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has been terrible since the budget: they are all sitting with their head in their hands.\u201d</p> <p>The company is dependent on British agriculture since exports dried up after Britain left the EU. \u201cBrexit killed it: people don\u2019t want the hassle,\u201d Cherry says.</p>    <p>He adds: \u201cEveryone you speak to is down: worst harvests, wettest harvests, wettest drilling time and now this, another nail in the coffin.\u201d</p> <p>The son of a farm worker, Cherry founded his business almost 45 years ago near Chipping Norton in the Cotswolds. \u201cNext to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/nov/22/jeremy-clarkson-presenter-firebrand-farmer-politician\">Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s farm</a>, before you ask,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Amid such a difficult outlook, Cherry worries that a prolonged downturn will force him to \u201cmake difficult decisions\u201d, which could involve redundancies among his 30 staff.</p> <p>\u201cFor lots of people who make a living off farms and selling machinery to farm businesses, this [the budget] has a direct impact for us and them,\u201d says Michael Grey, a regional sales manager at Farol, a family-owned dealership selling large equipment including tractors made by the US heavy machinery maker John Deere and telehandlers from German manufacturer Kramer.</p> <p>Farol, based in Oxfordshire, has some of the biggest pieces of kit on display, with correspondingly big prices. One of the newest models of self-propelled crop sprayers would set a farmer back over \u00a3370,000, while a mid-size tractor on the stand costs about \u00a3170,000.</p> <p>\u201cPurchase-wise, farmers are trying to work it out,\u201d says Grey\u2019s colleague Tom Hinchley, an area sales manager. \u201cOne or two have talked to us about different types of ownership \u2013 that could be leasing, so it doesn\u2019t go down as an asset.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the huge cost involved, some farmers have traditionally upgraded their machinery every three to five years, to take advantage of new technology. Some in the sector feel that could be about to change.</p> <p>\u201cLess footfall and closed wallets,\u201d says Matthew Derby, describing the mood at the show while discussing the budget measures over a quick lunch with two other Lincolnshire farmers. \u201cThe effect on cash flow is obvious.\u201d</p>    <p>For the third-generation food producer, uncertainty over future tax liabilities means his family is evaluating its spending. \u201cWith ongoing replacement policy, we would change something every year, but we will now look to push that back until we have more clarity,\u201d he says, in between bites of a burger. \u201cAt the point where investment in capital items is adding value and is taxable, that is a big concern.\u201d</p> <p>One of the few companies to be deluged with requests is Brown and Co, a property and business consultancy. \u201cThe phone has not stopped ringing,\u201d says land agent and partner Charlie Bryant. \u201cNo one should underestimate the angst that the whole budget has caused in the farming community.\u201d</p> <p>The government has insisted that most farms will not be affected by the changes, although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/04/nfu-rejects-treasury-claim-that-72-of-farms-wont-pay-inheritance-tax\">this has been rejected by the National Farmers Union (NFU)</a>. Farming representatives have said the changes will force some family farms to sell up in order to pay their inheritance tax bills.

      "bodyText": "A shiny new tractor is pulling a huge orange trailer, while a commentator explains how best to manoeuvre it to tip grain, watched by a group of farmers wrapped up warmly in wellies, coats and bobble hats, some holding spaniels on leads. Others are checking out the latest models of combine harvesters and crop sprayers, parked on snowy ground at the Midlands Machinery Show, but few seem to be buying, and the changes to inheritance tax for agricultural properties announced in Rachel Reeves\u2019s October budget are never far from anyone\u2019s lips. On a crisp and sunny November day, the mood at one of the UK\u2019s largest agricultural machinery shows was anything but bright. A frosty chill has also descended on the network of companies dependent on farm businesses purveying their wares in Newark. Machinery manufacturers and dealers, as well as building companies and suppliers, have a similar refrain: customers stopped calling straight after the chancellor set out the budget measures affecting the agricultural sector. \u201cThe phone got a lot quieter from the second she [Reeves] announced it,\u201d says Jonathan Richardson, sales manager at Browns of Wem, a Shropshire-based company which designs, makes and constructs steel-framed and timber-sectioned buildings. \u201cIt\u2019s had the quickest impact we have ever seen.\u201d Previously, farming businesses qualified for 100% relief on inheritance tax on agricultural and business property. However, budget changes will see the tax imposed on farms worth over \u00a31m, with an effective rate of 20% on assets above that threshold, rather than the normal 40% rate for inheritance tax. Labour has said farms worth \u00a33m could end up being exempt, as married couples can each claim \u00a31m tax-free, in addition to a family home worth up to \u00a31m. \u201cPeople tend to ring us in the first instance when they start thinking about [a new building]: those calls have stopped,\u201d Richardson says, on the company\u2019s stand at the Newark show, flanked by photos of farm buildings erected by the firm. Any belt-tightening and deferral of purchases by farmers would have a big effect on Browns of Wem, which depends on agricultural businesses for at least 90% of its trade. It would also send shockwaves through the network of companies \u2013 selling everything from tractors to tyres and farm gates to fertiliser \u2013 which make up the rural economy. \u201cWe are OK, we have a decent order book, but it is a lot quieter than it was,\u201d says Richardson. \u201cWe are hoping this is just a blip and confidence will recover.\u201d Taking place a day after thousands of farmers and landowners protested against the budget measures on the streets of London, signs propped on one display tractor warn \u201cDon\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you\u201d and \u201cSave a farmer, remove Starmer\u201d, underlining the strength of feeling in the farming community. The Treasury is understood to be assessing the impact of inheritance tax changes, including amending gifting rules for over-80s, which could allow them to pass on their farm to their heirs tax-free without having to live for seven years after making the gift. Officials are also understood to be assessing the impact of budget measures on active small and medium-sized farms compared with smallholdings. Some of the largest machines on display, such as massive tractors and combine harvesters, are manufactured abroad and shipped to the UK to be sold by networks of dealers. \u201cWe are a dying breed, UK manufacturers,\u201d says Graham Cherry, sitting inside a warm show stand, looking at the agricultural material handling equipment made by his company, Cherry Products, displayed outside in the snow. Their machinery attachments \u2013 including pallet forks, grain lifters and snowploughs \u2013 sell for between \u00a32,000 and \u00a38,000. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are selling, and those selling \u00a3100,000 tractors are struggling,\u201d he says, pointing at a nearby stand. \u201cTo survive, we need profitable farmers in the UK who will invest,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has been terrible since the budget: they are all sitting with their head in their hands.\u201d The company is dependent on British agriculture since exports dried up after Britain left the EU. \u201cBrexit killed it: people don\u2019t want the hassle,\u201d Cherry says. He adds: \u201cEveryone you speak to is down: worst harvests, wettest harvests, wettest drilling time and now this, another nail in the coffin.\u201d The son of a farm worker, Cherry founded his business almost 45 years ago near Chipping Norton in the Cotswolds. \u201cNext to Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s farm, before you ask,\u201d he says. Amid such a difficult outlook, Cherry worries that a prolonged downturn will force him to \u201cmake difficult decisions\u201d, which could involve redundancies among his 30 staff. \u201cFor lots of people who make a living off farms and selling machinery to farm businesses, this [the budget] has a direct impact for us and them,\u201d says Michael Grey, a regional sales manager at Farol, a family-owned dealership selling large equipment including tractors made by the US heavy machinery maker John Deere and telehandlers from German manufacturer Kramer. Farol, based in Oxfordshire, has some of the biggest pieces of kit on display, with correspondingly big prices. One of the newest models of self-propelled crop sprayers would set a farmer back over \u00a3370,000, while a mid-size tractor on the stand costs about \u00a3170,000. \u201cPurchase-wise, farmers are trying to work it out,\u201d says Grey\u2019s colleague Tom Hinchley, an area sales manager. \u201cOne or two have talked to us about different types of ownership \u2013 that could be leasing, so it doesn\u2019t go down as an asset.\u201d Despite the huge cost involved, some farmers have traditionally upgraded their machinery every three to five years, to take advantage of new technology. Some in the sector feel that could be about to change. \u201cLess footfall and closed wallets,\u201d says Matthew Derby, describing the mood at the show while discussing the budget measures over a quick lunch with two other Lincolnshire farmers. \u201cThe effect on cash flow is obvious.\u201d For the third-generation food producer, uncertainty over future tax liabilities means his family is evaluating its spending. \u201cWith ongoing replacement policy, we would change something every year, but we will now look to push that back until we have more clarity,\u201d he says, in between bites of a burger. \u201cAt the point where investment in capital items is adding value and is taxable, that is a big concern.\u201d One of the few companies to be deluged with requests is Brown and Co, a property and business consultancy. \u201cThe phone has not stopped ringing,\u201d says land agent and partner Charlie Bryant. \u201cNo one should underestimate the angst that the whole budget has caused in the farming community.\u201d The government has insisted that most farms will not be affected by the changes, although this has been rejected by the National Farmers Union (NFU). Farming representatives have said the changes will force some family farms to sell up in order to pay their inheritance tax bills. Bryant, who is based in Lincolnshire, carries out 200 stock-taking valuations on farms of differing sizes each year, visiting them to calculate the value of land, machinery and other assets for their annual accounts. \u201cI have been through my list and I haven\u2019t found one yet who will be under \u00a31m. That is 100% of my annual stock-taking valuation, before you start adding in crops in ground, crops in store, machinery,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the government are trying to aim for a certain section of society, very wealthy people who have bought land for inheritance tax, I think they are wildly off the mark.

      "body": "<p>One aphrodisiac fits all for the land girls in English National Opera\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.eno.org/whats-on/the-elixir-of-love/\">The Elixir of Love</a></strong>. Money. Discovering that Nemorino, poor, dull and lampooned, is an heir, they throw themselves at him. Not the point of Donizetti\u2019s 1832 romantic comedy, but a sharp insight into base human nature in a work that dices with cruelty. The elixir of the title is at once a trick peddled by a quack and true love itself, wherever it falls. In a new production by Harry Fehr, conducted by Teresa Riveiro B\u00f6hm \u2013 each making ENO debuts \u2013 Italian village life has been transposed to second world war England in 1943. To complicate the timeframe, all is presented, redundantly, as a 1970s sitcom complete with opening and closing titles.</p> <p>Mostly it succeeds. The jokes should get funnier, the audience may laugh more, once performances settle. The harvesting scene of Act 1 and the near-miss wedding in Act 2 are thrust into a country house interior, faded grandeur well observed in Nicky Shaw\u2019s sets. This stately pile, now a billet for the Women\u2019s Land Army, belongs to aristocratic Adina, loved hopelessly by Nemorino and bumptiously by Belcore. Everyone is in uniform: from unflattering breeches and brogues for the land girls to dashing air force blue for their male admirers. Belcore swaggers menacingly in officer\u2019s peaked cap and ribboned decorations. Nemorino alone is in civvies: tousle-haired, in Fair Isle V-neck and bags. How he escaped conscription is not fully explained: he lacks the pluck needed for conscientious objection.</p> <p>Chorus and orchestra directed their best and most disciplined energies into Donizetti\u2019s infectious score, some inconsistencies of tempo from the conductor momentarily causing slips of coordination.

      "bodyText": "One aphrodisiac fits all for the land girls in English National Opera\u2019s The Elixir of Love. Money. Discovering that Nemorino, poor, dull and lampooned, is an heir, they throw themselves at him. Not the point of Donizetti\u2019s 1832 romantic comedy, but a sharp insight into base human nature in a work that dices with cruelty. The elixir of the title is at once a trick peddled by a quack and true love itself, wherever it falls. In a new production by Harry Fehr, conducted by Teresa Riveiro B\u00f6hm \u2013 each making ENO debuts \u2013 Italian village life has been transposed to second world war England in 1943. To complicate the timeframe, all is presented, redundantly, as a 1970s sitcom complete with opening and closing titles. Mostly it succeeds. The jokes should get funnier, the audience may laugh more, once performances settle. The harvesting scene of Act 1 and the near-miss wedding in Act 2 are thrust into a country house interior, faded grandeur well observed in Nicky Shaw\u2019s sets. This stately pile, now a billet for the Women\u2019s Land Army, belongs to aristocratic Adina, loved hopelessly by Nemorino and bumptiously by Belcore. Everyone is in uniform: from unflattering breeches and brogues for the land girls to dashing air force blue for their male admirers. Belcore swaggers menacingly in officer\u2019s peaked cap and ribboned decorations. Nemorino alone is in civvies: tousle-haired, in Fair Isle V-neck and bags. How he escaped conscription is not fully explained: he lacks the pluck needed for conscientious objection. Chorus and orchestra directed their best and most disciplined energies into Donizetti\u2019s infectious score, some inconsistencies of tempo from the conductor momentarily causing slips of coordination. On first night, soloists sounded underpowered at the start, either because too much of the action took place upstage, or because no one realised that in this large space, more projection, and better articulation of the text (in Amanda Holden\u2019s translation) were needed. Either way, as Nemorino, the New Zealand tenor Thomas Atkins showed the lyrical range of his voice only after the interval, but in good time for his turning-point aria, Una furtiva lagrima (A Furtive Tear). Here it dawns on him that Adina \u2013 the Welsh soprano Rhian Lois, bold-voiced and spirited \u2013 is in love with him, and not with the conceited Belcore (Dan D\u2019Souza) after all. The busy crowd on stage, and the absence of intimacy, has erased some of Donizetti\u2019s light and shade. Class distinctions, too, are played down. The American bass-baritone Brandon Cedel was winningly unctuous as the elixir-touting Dulcamara. Segomotso Masego Shupinyaneng managed to make the small role of Giannetta grow larger. With a few tweaks and tighter humour, this show could have a long life at the Coliseum. Or anywhere else. On Thursday, after months of uncertainty, ENO launched its plans for \u201ca transformative cultural programme with the city-region\u201d of Manchester. We wait and hope.

      "body": "<h2>Alex Ferguson, Oxford 2-0 Manchester United, 8 Nov 1986</h2> <p>Two days after leaving Aberdeen, Ferguson sent out an XI including Paul McGrath, Jesper Olsen, Peter Davenport, Graeme Hogg and Clayton Blackmore that fell to a 16th-minute John Aldridge penalty and an 89th-minute Neil Slatter strike. \u201cIt was a nightmare trying to concentrate with so much media attention and so many cameramen on top of me,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cThey [the players] were a bit uptight and they wanted to do well.\u201d None were in the 1-0 1990 FA Cup final replay triumph over Crystal Palace, Ferguson\u2019s first trophy, though Blackmore was an unused substitute. Twenty-six and a half years after the Oxford reverse Ferguson retired as the UK\u2019s greatest manager and a knight.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/22/ruben-amorim-manchester-united-vortex\">Ruben Amorim eyes golden chance as he enters Manchester United vortex</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>David Moyes, Swansea 1-4 Manchester United, 17 Aug 2013</h2> <p>The 2-0 Community Shield victory over Wigan was followed six days later by a hammering of Swansea that featured another two Robin van Persie goals, plus Danny Welbeck\u2019s double. Rio Ferdinand, who started in central defence, said: \u201cThe season\u2019s started and we are really looking forward to it. We see the things said in the media and every next person is tipping someone else to win the league and putting us in third or fourth place.\u201d The media were over-optimistic. United, the reigning champions, ended seventh with 64 points, 22 behind Manchester City, Moyes having been sacked after 34 league matches.</p> <h2>Louis van Gaal, Manchester United 1-2 Swansea, 16 Aug 2014</h2> <p>Like Ferguson the Dutchman lost but Van Gaal\u2019s sinking experience came before a hushed home crowd. Wayne Rooney\u2019s 53rd-minute goal cancelled Ki Sung-yueng\u2019s first-half opener for the Swans but Gylfi Sigurdsson struck again for the visitors as United, under Van Gaal, began with a four-game losing streak that included a 4-0 League Cup trouncing at MK Dons. Two years later, after leading United to the 2016 FA Cup \u2013 a first piece of post-Ferguson silverware \u2013 Van Gaal was sacked.</p>    <h2>Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Bournemouth 1-3 Manchester United, 14 Aug 2016</h2> <p>Juan Mata, Wayne Rooney and Zlatan Ibrahimovic fired the Special One to a fine opening-weekend victory a week after the 2-1 Community Shield win against Leicester (Ibrahimovic and Jesse Lingard United\u2019s scorers), igniting a four-match winning sequence. By the campaign\u2019s close Mourinho had added the League Cup and Europa League to the club\u2019s cabinet room and the following season United finished second. But a \u201crespect, respect, respect\u201d tirade at this writer after a 3-0 home loss to Tottenham in August 2018 signalled the beginning of the end for Mourinho, who was gone by that December.</p> <h2>Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, Manchester United 2-1 Watford, 30 Mar 2019</h2> <p>After three months as a caretaker after Mourinho\u2019s sacking, the Norwegian was made the No 1 and could thank Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial for the dream beginning (Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 scored late for the Hornets). But after losing only three games of 19 as interim manager, the Watford victory was followed that season by just one more win \u2013 2-1 over West Ham. Six defeats and two draws were Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s other results in the closing third of 2018-19 as United limped to sixth. Third- and second-place finishes followed in his two complete seasons yet on 22 November 2021 he was axed.</p> <h2>Erik ten Hag, Manchester United 1-2 Brighton, 7 Aug 2022</h2> <p>A humbling for the fifth permanent post-Ferguson manager that prompted Ten Hag to declare it a \u201chell of a job\u201d afterwards. Christian Eriksen was chosen as a false 9 and proved as poor as United\u2019s execution of the \u201cproactive\u201d football their manager had trumpeted. The display was an apt harbinger of Ten Hag\u2019s shaky reign which garnered a League Cup and third place plus last season\u2019s FA Cup but which ended on 28 October, before Ruben Amorim\u2019s hiring.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Alex Ferguson, Oxford 2-0 Manchester United, 8 Nov 1986 Two days after leaving Aberdeen, Ferguson sent out an XI including Paul McGrath, Jesper Olsen, Peter Davenport, Graeme Hogg and Clayton Blackmore that fell to a 16th-minute John Aldridge penalty and an 89th-minute Neil Slatter strike. \u201cIt was a nightmare trying to concentrate with so much media attention and so many cameramen on top of me,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cThey [the players] were a bit uptight and they wanted to do well.\u201d None were in the 1-0 1990 FA Cup final replay triumph over Crystal Palace, Ferguson\u2019s first trophy, though Blackmore was an unused substitute. Twenty-six and a half years after the Oxford reverse Ferguson retired as the UK\u2019s greatest manager and a knight. David Moyes, Swansea 1-4 Manchester United, 17 Aug 2013 The 2-0 Community Shield victory over Wigan was followed six days later by a hammering of Swansea that featured another two Robin van Persie goals, plus Danny Welbeck\u2019s double. Rio Ferdinand, who started in central defence, said: \u201cThe season\u2019s started and we are really looking forward to it. We see the things said in the media and every next person is tipping someone else to win the league and putting us in third or fourth place.\u201d The media were over-optimistic. United, the reigning champions, ended seventh with 64 points, 22 behind Manchester City, Moyes having been sacked after 34 league matches. Louis van Gaal, Manchester United 1-2 Swansea, 16 Aug 2014 Like Ferguson the Dutchman lost but Van Gaal\u2019s sinking experience came before a hushed home crowd. Wayne Rooney\u2019s 53rd-minute goal cancelled Ki Sung-yueng\u2019s first-half opener for the Swans but Gylfi Sigurdsson struck again for the visitors as United, under Van Gaal, began with a four-game losing streak that included a 4-0 League Cup trouncing at MK Dons. Two years later, after leading United to the 2016 FA Cup \u2013 a first piece of post-Ferguson silverware \u2013 Van Gaal was sacked. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Bournemouth 1-3 Manchester United, 14 Aug 2016 Juan Mata, Wayne Rooney and Zlatan Ibrahimovic fired the Special One to a fine opening-weekend victory a week after the 2-1 Community Shield win against Leicester (Ibrahimovic and Jesse Lingard United\u2019s scorers), igniting a four-match winning sequence. By the campaign\u2019s close Mourinho had added the League Cup and Europa League to the club\u2019s cabinet room and the following season United finished second. But a \u201crespect, respect, respect\u201d tirade at this writer after a 3-0 home loss to Tottenham in August 2018 signalled the beginning of the end for Mourinho, who was gone by that December. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, Manchester United 2-1 Watford, 30 Mar 2019 After three months as a caretaker after Mourinho\u2019s sacking, the Norwegian was made the No 1 and could thank Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial for the dream beginning (Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 scored late for the Hornets). But after losing only three games of 19 as interim manager, the Watford victory was followed that season by just one more win \u2013 2-1 over West Ham. Six defeats and two draws were Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s other results in the closing third of 2018-19 as United limped to sixth. Third- and second-place finishes followed in his two complete seasons yet on 22 November 2021 he was axed. Erik ten Hag, Manchester United 1-2 Brighton, 7 Aug 2022 A humbling for the fifth permanent post-Ferguson manager that prompted Ten Hag to declare it a \u201chell of a job\u201d afterwards. Christian Eriksen was chosen as a false 9 and proved as poor as United\u2019s execution of the \u201cproactive\u201d football their manager had trumpeted. The display was an apt harbinger of Ten Hag\u2019s shaky reign which garnered a League Cup and third place plus last season\u2019s FA Cup but which ended on 28 October, before Ruben Amorim\u2019s hiring.",

      "body": "<p>After watching Kamala Harris lose the White House and Republicans wrest back full control of Congress, Democrats were bracing for disaster in state legislatures. With the party defending narrow majorities in several chambers across the country, some Democrats expected that Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential race would allow a red wave to sweep through state legislatures.</p> <p>Yet, when the dust had settled after election day, the results of state legislative elections presented a much more nuanced picture than Democrats had feared.</p> <p>To their disappointment, Democrats failed to gain ground in Arizona and New Hampshire, where Republicans expanded their legislative majorities, and they lost governing trifectas in Michigan and Minnesota.</p> <p>But other states delivered reason for hope. Democrats held on to a one-seat majority in the Pennsylvania house even as Harris and congressional incumbents struggled across the state. In North Carolina, Democrats brought an end to Republicans\u2019 legislative supermajority, restoring Governor-elect Josh Stein\u2019s veto power. Perhaps most encouragingly for the party, Democrats made substantial gains in Wisconsin, where newly redrawn and much more competitive maps left the party well-poised to gain majorities in 2026.</p> <p>The mixed results could help Democrats push back against Republicans\u2019 federal policies at the state level, and they offer potential insight on the party\u2019s best electoral strategies as they prepare for the new Trump era.</p> <p>\u201cWe must pay attention to what\u2019s going on in our backyard with the same level of enthusiasm that we do to what\u2019s happening in the White House,\u201d said Heather Williams, the president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC). \u201cAnd I feel like that\u2019s never been more true.\u201d</p> <p>The implications of the state legislative elections will be sweeping, Williams said. Democratic legislators have already helped protect abortion access in their states following the overturning of Roe v Wade, and with Republicans overseeing the federal budget, state legislatures could play a pivotal role in funding critical and underresourced services for their constituents.</p> <p>Those high stakes have made Democrats increasingly aware of the importance of state legislatures, where Republicans have held a significant advantage in recent years. In 2016, when Trump first won office, Republicans held 68 legislative chambers compared with Democrats\u2019 29, according to the DLCC. Following the elections this month, Democrats <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/State_legislative_elections,_2024\">expect</a> to control 39 chambers, down from 41 before the elections but still a notable improvement since the beginning of Trump\u2019s first term.</p> <p>As Democrats have turned more of their attention to state legislative races, outside groups have joined the fight. The States Project, a Democratic-aligned organization, poured $70m into legislative elections this cycle, while the Super Pac Forward Majority devoted another $45m to the effort. The funding provided a substantial boon beyond the resources of the DLCC, the party\u2019s official state legislative campaign arm that set a spending goal of $60m this cycle.</p>    <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science that dollars, tactics and message are potent ways to communicate with voters,\u201d said Daniel Squadron, co-founder of the States Project. \u201cWe provide the dollars to candidates that let them get off the phones, separate themselves from in-state special interests and allow them to talk to voters and to treat these campaigns like the big-league contests they are.\u201d</p> <p>Historically, Democratic state legislative candidates have trailed several points behind the party\u2019s presidential nominee, but early data suggests legislative candidates actually outperformed Harris in some key districts. Squadron believes face-to-face interactions with voters, as well as the high quality of many Democratic state legislative candidates this cycle, helped stave off larger losses down ballot even as the party suffered in federal races.</p> <p>\u201cThat is the only way it was possible to hold the Pennsylvania house when the statewide results were so disappointing. It\u2019s the reason the North Carolina house supermajority was broken,\u201d Squadron said.</p> <p>Democrats\u2019 strategies appear to have proved particularly potent in Wisconsin, where the party picked up 10 seats in the state assembly and four seats in the state senate. Andrew Whitley, executive director of the Wisconsin senate Democratic caucus, credited the wins to savvy candidates who combined a message about the importance of abortion access with hyperlocal issues important in their specific districts. The strategy allowed candidates to outperform Harris and/or Senator Tammy Baldwin in four out of five targeted senate races, according to data provided by Whitley.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very rare when you have bottom-of-the-ticket state legislators over-perform Kamala and Senator Baldwin,\u201d Whitley said. \u201cThey worked their asses off.\u201d</p> <p>In senate district 14, which stretches north-west from Madison, Democrat Sarah Keyeski appears to have benefited from some of Trump\u2019s supporters failing to vote down ballot for the Republican incumbent, Joan Ballweg. But in senate district 8 in the Milwaukee suburbs and district 30 in Green Bay, a small yet decisive number of voters split their ticket between Trump and Democratic legislative candidates.</p> <p>The results suggest that Trump\u2019s playbook may not be enough to elevate Republican state legislators to victory, presenting an opening for Democrats in future election cycles. As further evidence of that trend, Democrats managed to hold four Senate seats in states that Trump carried on election day.</p> <p>\u201cThe Maga [\u2018Make America Great Again\u2019] playbook doesn\u2019t work at the state legislative level,\u201d said Leslie Martes, chief strategy officer of Forward Majority. \u201cTrump is Trump, and he\u2019s incredibly masterful at what he does, but as we see time after time, Republicans struggle to duplicate it.\u201d</p> <p>The next big test for Republicans will come next year in Virginia, where Democrats hope to flip the governor\u2019s mansion and maintain control of both legislative chambers.</p> <p>\u201cThis will be Trump\u2019s first task after this election, to see if he can push that playbook,\u201d Martes said. \u201cHe\u2019ll want that to keep his mandate going.\u201d</p> <p>Williams and her team are already gearing up for 2025 and 2026, when Democrats will have another chance to expand their power in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Although the 2026 target map is still taking shape, Williams predicted it would look quite similar to this year\u2019s map.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like we can all kind of expect to see some of those familiar faces back,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are really competitive states, and that is where we are going to be focusing our attention.\u201d</p> <p>Even though Democrats remain in the legislative minority in Wisconsin, Whitley expressed enthusiasm about the results and the road ahead. This year marked the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/25/wisconsin-new-voting-maps-gerrymandering-republicans-democrats\">first time since 2012</a> that Wisconsin Democrats had the opportunity to run on competitive maps, and they broke Republicans\u2019 iron grip on the legislature.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be truly historic,\u201d Whitley said. \u201cGone are the days where a manufactured majority can override vetoes and pass super-regressive policies.

      "bodyText": "After watching Kamala Harris lose the White House and Republicans wrest back full control of Congress, Democrats were bracing for disaster in state legislatures. With the party defending narrow majorities in several chambers across the country, some Democrats expected that Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential race would allow a red wave to sweep through state legislatures. Yet, when the dust had settled after election day, the results of state legislative elections presented a much more nuanced picture than Democrats had feared. To their disappointment, Democrats failed to gain ground in Arizona and New Hampshire, where Republicans expanded their legislative majorities, and they lost governing trifectas in Michigan and Minnesota. But other states delivered reason for hope. Democrats held on to a one-seat majority in the Pennsylvania house even as Harris and congressional incumbents struggled across the state. In North Carolina, Democrats brought an end to Republicans\u2019 legislative supermajority, restoring Governor-elect Josh Stein\u2019s veto power. Perhaps most encouragingly for the party, Democrats made substantial gains in Wisconsin, where newly redrawn and much more competitive maps left the party well-poised to gain majorities in 2026. The mixed results could help Democrats push back against Republicans\u2019 federal policies at the state level, and they offer potential insight on the party\u2019s best electoral strategies as they prepare for the new Trump era. \u201cWe must pay attention to what\u2019s going on in our backyard with the same level of enthusiasm that we do to what\u2019s happening in the White House,\u201d said Heather Williams, the president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC). \u201cAnd I feel like that\u2019s never been more true.\u201d The implications of the state legislative elections will be sweeping, Williams said. Democratic legislators have already helped protect abortion access in their states following the overturning of Roe v Wade, and with Republicans overseeing the federal budget, state legislatures could play a pivotal role in funding critical and underresourced services for their constituents. Those high stakes have made Democrats increasingly aware of the importance of state legislatures, where Republicans have held a significant advantage in recent years. In 2016, when Trump first won office, Republicans held 68 legislative chambers compared with Democrats\u2019 29, according to the DLCC. Following the elections this month, Democrats expect to control 39 chambers, down from 41 before the elections but still a notable improvement since the beginning of Trump\u2019s first term. As Democrats have turned more of their attention to state legislative races, outside groups have joined the fight. The States Project, a Democratic-aligned organization, poured $70m into legislative elections this cycle, while the Super Pac Forward Majority devoted another $45m to the effort. The funding provided a substantial boon beyond the resources of the DLCC, the party\u2019s official state legislative campaign arm that set a spending goal of $60m this cycle. \u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science that dollars, tactics and message are potent ways to communicate with voters,\u201d said Daniel Squadron, co-founder of the States Project. \u201cWe provide the dollars to candidates that let them get off the phones, separate themselves from in-state special interests and allow them to talk to voters and to treat these campaigns like the big-league contests they are.\u201d Historically, Democratic state legislative candidates have trailed several points behind the party\u2019s presidential nominee, but early data suggests legislative candidates actually outperformed Harris in some key districts. Squadron believes face-to-face interactions with voters, as well as the high quality of many Democratic state legislative candidates this cycle, helped stave off larger losses down ballot even as the party suffered in federal races. \u201cThat is the only way it was possible to hold the Pennsylvania house when the statewide results were so disappointing.

      "body": "<p>It might be a weekly free Greggs sausage roll, cinema tickets, insurance to replace your teenager\u2019s smashed iPhone screen, or annual travel insurance. All of the main high street and digital banks, including Monzo and Revolut, now offer paid-for packaged current accounts where everyday banking comes with a set of enticing perks.</p> <p>From December, one of the most popular, Nationwide\u2019s FlexPlus current account, is going up from \u00a313 to \u00a318 a month.</p> <p>With that, and many other accounts, now costing more than \u00a3200 a year, you can waste lot of money if you are not making the most of the freebies.</p> <p>\u201cWhether or not packaged bank accounts offer good value comes down to one simple question,\u201d says Sam Richardson, the deputy editor of Which? Money. \u201cWill you use the additional perks frequently? If the answer is yes, then there are some good options on the market.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you are thinking of switching to a packaged bank account, also make sure you\u2019re not doubling up on cover,\u201d he adds. \u201cMobile phone and gadget cover may already be part of your home contents insurance.\u201d</p> <p>Here is how the main packaged accounts stack up, and what to consider before you open one.</p> <h2>Nationwide FlexPlus</h2> <p><strong>Monthly cost</strong> \u00a318 from 1 December (\u00a3216 a year).</p> <p><strong>What does it include? </strong>Annual worldwide travel insurance, including the US and winter sports cover, for you and your family, which means a partner you live with, and any dependent children aged under 23.</p> <p>Mobile phone insurance for you, a partner you live with and children aged under 19, or under 22 if they are in full-time education.</p> <p>AA UK and European breakdown assistance cover for all your vehicles. Family are covered if they are driving a car you own.</p> <p><strong>Other perks </strong>No charge for using your card abroad. The fee is usually 2.99% of the transaction value.</p> <p>A switching incentive of \u00a3175 cash provided you are coming from a non-Nationwide bank account and bring at least two active direct debits, pay in at least \u00a31,000 and use your debit card within a month. This incentive is also available on free accounts.</p> <p><strong>Worth considering </strong>Of all the travel insurance attached to packaged accounts, this may work out as the best-value for older people who travel a lot, as there is no upper age limit. Standalone travel insurance can be really pricey for travellers in their 70s, 80s and beyond. The average single-trip premium is \u00a3190 for those aged 71 to 75, compared with \u00a338 for those aged 36 to 40, according to the Association of British Insurers. The consumer group Which? rates Nationwide\u2019s travel insurance as one of the best on the market as a result.</p>    <h2>Virgin Money Club M</h2> <p><strong>Monthly cost </strong>\u00a312.50 (\u00a3150 a year).</p> <p><strong>What does it include? </strong>Annual worldwide travel insurance, including US and winter sports cover, for you, your partner and up to four children, including stepchildren, up to 18 years old. The upper age limit is 75.</p> <p>Worldwide mobile and gadget insurance, covering loss, theft and accidental damage, for you and family members living with you, which covers not just mobiles but laptops, iPads, games consoles, digital cameras \u2013 most things with a&nbsp;plug - up to \u00a32,000 a device.</p> <p><strong>Other perks </strong>No charge for using your card abroad, although this is also the case with Virgin Money\u2019s free accounts.</p> <p>Interest of 1% paid on your current account balance up to \u00a31,000, and access to a linked children\u2019s bank account for 11- to 15-year-olds, plus exclusive savings rates.</p> <p><strong>Worth considering </strong>Which? scores the Virgin account particularly highly for the quality of breakdown cover. It is also one of the few accounts to provide gadget insurance. A similar family gadget policy would cost \u00a3150 to upwards of \u00a3300 a year, depending on the number of devices it protected.</p> <h2>Co-operative Bank Everyday Extra</h2> <p><strong>Monthly cost </strong>\u00a315 (\u00a3180 a year).</p> <p><strong>What does it include? </strong>Annual worldwide family travel insurance including dependent children up to age 22 in full-time education. The maximum age is 80, although winter sports cover is capped at age 65.</p> <p>Mobile phone insurance for the account holder, covering up to \u00a31,500 for a handset, and up to \u00a3350 for any accessories such as headphones if they are lost at the same time.</p> <p>RAC UK and European breakdown cover.</p> <p><strong>Other perks </strong>You can earn \u00a375 for moving your to the Co-op Bank, plus \u00a325 a month for three months on top, by actively using the account \u2013 but this offer is ending on Sunday 24 November, so you will need to be quick. (This offer also applies to the bank\u2019s free accounts.) Until 13 December, the bank will cover the first three months of subscription fees: you pay \u00a315 a month, but a total of \u00a345 will be put back into your account.</p> <p><strong>Worth considering </strong>The mobile phone insurance is less generous than on other packaged accounts, which tend to cover phones up to \u00a32,000. It does, however, have a lower policy excess of \u00a375 (most are \u00a3100). You can make up to two claims in a 12-month period. To extend the mobile insurance to a partner, you could take this out as a joint account, for no extra cost.</p>    <h2>Halifax Ultimate Reward</h2> <p><strong>Monthly cost </strong>\u00a319 (\u00a3228) a year.</p> <p><strong>What does it include? </strong>Annual worldwide travel insurance, including for a partner and children up to age 18, or 24 if they are in full-time education. The maximum age to claim is 70.</p> <p>AA breakdown cover, including family members travelling in any car.</p> <p>Mobile phone insurance for account holders only.</p> <p>Home emergency cover of up to \u00a3250 for a callout to fix an urgent issue such as the central heating not working or a burst pipe.</p> <p><strong>Other perks </strong>No charge for using your card abroad. The normal transaction fee is 2.99%.</p> <p>You get to choose one monthly reward: \u00a35 cashback, one Vue cinema ticket, or three digital magazines such as Men\u2019s Health, as long as you spend at least \u00a3500 a month on your debit card or keep&nbsp;\u00a35,000 in your account, and pay in \u00a31,500 a month and stay in credit.</p> <p><strong>Worth considering </strong>Take as a joint account and the mobile phone cover will apply to both you and a partner, for the same monthly fee.</p> <p>The breakdown policy is less comprehensive than other banks \u2013 it does not cover you for driving outside of the UK or include vehicle recovery or onward travel where you can be towed any distance, or hotel accommodation while you wait for your car to be fixed.</p> <h2>Club Lloyds Silver</h2> <p><strong>Monthly cost </strong>\u00a311.50 (\u00a3138 a year) plus a \u00a33 a month Club Lloyds fee (\u00a336 a year). The latter is waived during every month you pay in \u00a32,000 or more.</p> <p><strong>What does it include? </strong>Annual UK and European family travel insurance up to the age of 65, including children aged up to 18, or up to 24 if in full-time education.</p> <p>Mobile phone insurance covering one phone for each account holder; that means you can double up if it is a joint account for no extra cost.</p> <p>AA breakdown cover including family members travelling in any car as driver or passenger.</p> <p><strong>Other perks </strong>No charge for using your card abroad. The normal transaction fee is 2.99%.</p> <p>You choose a \u201clifestyle benefit\u201d each year: either 12 months of Disney+, six Odeon or Vue cinema tickets, an annual digital Coffee Club and Gourmet Society membership, or an annual subscription to a magazine such as Good Housekeeping. This offer applies to all Club Lloyds accounts, including that with a lower \u00a33-a-month fee.</p> <p>Until 10 December, you can receive \u00a3200 for switching to the account, provided you move across three active direct debits using the Current Account Switch Service (Cass). </p> <p><strong>Worth considering </strong>This is one of only a few accounts that offers annual European rather than worldwide insurance. Older travellers are not covered, though Lloyds does offer insurance up to age 80 with its more expensive Club Lloyds Platinum account at \u00a322.50 a month.</p> <p>As with its sister bank Halifax, the breakdown cover is less comprehensive than that offered by some other banks.</p>    <h2>NatWest Reward Silver</h2> <p><strong>Monthly cost</strong> \u00a310 (\u00a3120 a year).</p> <p><strong>What does it include? </strong>Annual European travel insurance for the account holder only, up to age 70. It&nbsp;covers winter sports, and trips up to 22 days in length.</p> <p>Mobile phone insurance covering loss, theft, accidental damage and breakdown (once the manufacturer warranty has expired), but only for the account holder.</p> <p><strong>Other perks </strong>Fee-free debit card purchases abroad. The fee is usually 2.75% of the transaction.</p> <p>Earn \u00a34 a month in rewards for setting up two or more direct debits, plus an extra \u00a31 a month for logging into the mobile app. This can go into your account as cash, or be donated to charity or exchanged for gift cards at B&amp;Q and others.</p> <p>You can get \u00a3180 paid into your account if you switch to NatWest Reward Silver using Cass, provided you deposit \u00a31,250 and log into the app. This applies to any Reward account, including a cheaper option costing \u00a32 a month.</p> <p><strong>Worth considering </strong>This is an cost-effective account if you do not have a car, as no breakdown cover is included.</p> <p>You can pay an additional \u00a375 a year to extend the age limit of the European insurance above 70; if you have a joint account and both need the extension you will need to pay \u00a3150.</p> <h2>Monzo Max</h2> <p><strong>Monthly cost</strong> \u00a317 (\u00a3204 a year).</p> <p><strong>What does it include? </strong>Annual worldwide travel insurance for the account holder only, up to maximum age of 70, including car hire excess waiver insurance of up to \u00a33,000.</p> <p>Worldwide phone insurance, including coverage for cracked screens, for phones worth up to \u00a32,000 and accessories (such as headphones) worth up to \u00a3300.</p> <p>RAC UK and Europe breakdown cover including if you are a passenger.</p> <p><strong>Other perks </strong>These include a free weekly Greggs treat, either a regular-sized hot drink, sausage roll or sweet treat, plus an annual railcard with Trainline giving a third off eligible rail journeys in England, Scotland and Wales, and a free Vue cinema ticket each month. We estimate this bundle, if you were to take advantage of all of it every week, is worth about \u00a320 a month. A Greggs flat white is \u00a32, an annual railcard typically costs \u00a330 a year, and Vue cinema ticket prices vary.</p> <p>Access to premium budgeting tools such as virtual cards and customisable pots.</p> <p>Fee-free ATM withdrawals abroad (unlimited in Europe, and \u00a3600 fee-free every 30 days elsewhere.

      "bodyText": "It might be a weekly free Greggs sausage roll, cinema tickets, insurance to replace your teenager\u2019s smashed iPhone screen, or annual travel insurance. All of the main high street and digital banks, including Monzo and Revolut, now offer paid-for packaged current accounts where everyday banking comes with a set of enticing perks. From December, one of the most popular, Nationwide\u2019s FlexPlus current account, is going up from \u00a313 to \u00a318 a month. With that, and many other accounts, now costing more than \u00a3200 a year, you can waste lot of money if you are not making the most of the freebies. \u201cWhether or not packaged bank accounts offer good value comes down to one simple question,\u201d says Sam Richardson, the deputy editor of Which? Money. \u201cWill you use the additional perks frequently? If the answer is yes, then there are some good options on the market.\u201d \u201cIf you are thinking of switching to a packaged bank account, also make sure you\u2019re not doubling up on cover,\u201d he adds. \u201cMobile phone and gadget cover may already be part of your home contents insurance.\u201d Here is how the main packaged accounts stack up, and what to consider before you open one. Nationwide FlexPlus Monthly cost \u00a318 from 1 December (\u00a3216 a year). What does it include? Annual worldwide travel insurance, including the US and winter sports cover, for you and your family, which means a partner you live with, and any dependent children aged under 23. Mobile phone insurance for you, a partner you live with and children aged under 19, or under 22 if they are in full-time education. AA UK and European breakdown assistance cover for all your vehicles. Family are covered if they are driving a car you own. Other perks No charge for using your card abroad. The fee is usually 2.99% of the transaction value. A switching incentive of \u00a3175 cash provided you are coming from a non-Nationwide bank account and bring at least two active direct debits, pay in at least \u00a31,000 and use your debit card within a month. This incentive is also available on free accounts. Worth considering Of all the travel insurance attached to packaged accounts, this may work out as the best-value for older people who travel a lot, as there is no upper age limit. Standalone travel insurance can be really pricey for travellers in their 70s, 80s and beyond. The average single-trip premium is \u00a3190 for those aged 71 to 75, compared with \u00a338 for those aged 36 to 40, according to the Association of British Insurers. The consumer group Which? rates Nationwide\u2019s travel insurance as one of the best on the market as a result. Virgin Money Club M Monthly cost \u00a312.50 (\u00a3150 a year). What does it include? Annual worldwide travel insurance, including US and winter sports cover, for you, your partner and up to four children, including stepchildren, up to 18 years old. The upper age limit is 75. Worldwide mobile and gadget insurance, covering loss, theft and accidental damage, for you and family members living with you, which covers not just mobiles but laptops, iPads, games consoles, digital cameras \u2013 most things with a plug - up to \u00a32,000 a device. Other perks No charge for using your card abroad, although this is also the case with Virgin Money\u2019s free accounts. Interest of 1% paid on your current account balance up to \u00a31,000, and access to a linked children\u2019s bank account for 11- to 15-year-olds, plus exclusive savings rates. Worth considering Which? scores the Virgin account particularly highly for the quality of breakdown cover. It is also one of the few accounts to provide gadget insurance. A similar family gadget policy would cost \u00a3150 to upwards of \u00a3300 a year, depending on the number of devices it protected. Co-operative Bank Everyday Extra Monthly cost \u00a315 (\u00a3180 a year). What does it include? Annual worldwide family travel insurance including dependent children up to age 22 in full-time education. The maximum age is 80, although winter sports cover is capped at age 65. Mobile phone insurance for the account holder, covering up to \u00a31,500 for a handset, and up to \u00a3350 for any accessories such as headphones if they are lost at the same time. RAC UK and European breakdown cover. Other perks You can earn \u00a375 for moving your to the Co-op Bank, plus \u00a325 a month for three months on top, by actively using the account \u2013 but this offer is ending on Sunday 24 November, so you will need to be quick. (This offer also applies to the bank\u2019s free accounts.) Until 13 December, the bank will cover the first three months of subscription fees: you pay \u00a315 a month, but a total of \u00a345 will be put back into your account. Worth considering The mobile phone insurance is less generous than on other packaged accounts, which tend to cover phones up to \u00a32,000. It does, however, have a lower policy excess of \u00a375 (most are \u00a3100). You can make up to two claims in a 12-month period. To extend the mobile insurance to a partner, you could take this out as a joint account, for no extra cost. Halifax Ultimate Reward Monthly cost \u00a319 (\u00a3228) a year. What does it include? Annual worldwide travel insurance, including for a partner and children up to age 18, or 24 if they are in full-time education. The maximum age to claim is 70. AA breakdown cover, including family members travelling in any car. Mobile phone insurance for account holders only. Home emergency cover of up to \u00a3250 for a callout to fix an urgent issue such as the central heating not working or a burst pipe. Other perks No charge for using your card abroad. The normal transaction fee is 2.99%. You get to choose one monthly reward: \u00a35 cashback, one Vue cinema ticket, or three digital magazines such as Men\u2019s Health, as long as you spend at least \u00a3500 a month on your debit card or keep \u00a35,000 in your account, and pay in \u00a31,500 a month and stay in credit. Worth considering Take as a joint account and the mobile phone cover will apply to both you and a partner, for the same monthly fee. The breakdown policy is less comprehensive than other banks \u2013 it does not cover you for driving outside of the UK or include vehicle recovery or onward travel where you can be towed any distance, or hotel accommodation while you wait for your car to be fixed. Club Lloyds Silver Monthly cost \u00a311.50 (\u00a3138 a year) plus a \u00a33 a month Club Lloyds fee (\u00a336 a year). The latter is waived during every month you pay in \u00a32,000 or more. What does it include? Annual UK and European family travel insurance up to the age of 65, including children aged up to 18, or up to 24 if in full-time education. Mobile phone insurance covering one phone for each account holder; that means you can double up if it is a joint account for no extra cost. AA breakdown cover including family members travelling in any car as driver or passenger. Other perks No charge for using your card abroad. The normal transaction fee is 2.99%. You choose a \u201clifestyle benefit\u201d each year: either 12 months of Disney+, six Odeon or Vue cinema tickets, an annual digital Coffee Club and Gourmet Society membership, or an annual subscription to a magazine such as Good Housekeeping. This offer applies to all Club Lloyds accounts, including that with a lower \u00a33-a-month fee. Until 10 December, you can receive \u00a3200 for switching to the account, provided you move across three active direct debits using the Current Account Switch Service (Cass). Worth considering This is one of only a few accounts that offers annual European rather than worldwide insurance. Older travellers are not covered, though Lloyds does offer insurance up to age 80 with its more expensive Club Lloyds Platinum account at \u00a322.50 a month. As with its sister bank Halifax, the breakdown cover is less comprehensive than that offered by some other banks. NatWest Reward Silver Monthly cost \u00a310 (\u00a3120 a year). What does it include? Annual European travel insurance for the account holder only, up to age 70. It covers winter sports, and trips up to 22 days in length. Mobile phone insurance covering loss, theft, accidental damage and breakdown (once the manufacturer warranty has expired), but only for the account holder. Other perks Fee-free debit card purchases abroad. The fee is usually 2.75% of the transaction. Earn \u00a34 a month in rewards for setting up two or more direct debits, plus an extra \u00a31 a month for logging into the mobile app. This can go into your account as cash, or be donated to charity or exchanged for gift cards at B&amp;Q and others. You can get \u00a3180 paid into your account if you switch to NatWest Reward Silver using Cass, provided you deposit \u00a31,250 and log into the app. This applies to any Reward account, including a cheaper option costing \u00a32 a month. Worth considering This is an cost-effective account if you do not have a car, as no breakdown cover is included. You can pay an additional \u00a375 a year to extend the age limit of the European insurance above 70; if you have a joint account and both need the extension you will need to pay \u00a3150. Monzo Max Monthly cost \u00a317 (\u00a3204 a year). What does it include? Annual worldwide travel insurance for the account holder only, up to maximum age of 70, including car hire excess waiver insurance of up to \u00a33,000. Worldwide phone insurance, including coverage for cracked screens, for phones worth up to \u00a32,000 and accessories (such as headphones) worth up to \u00a3300. RAC UK and Europe breakdown cover including if you are a passenger. Other perks These include a free weekly Greggs treat, either a regular-sized hot drink, sausage roll or sweet treat, plus an annual railcard with Trainline giving a third off eligible rail journeys in England, Scotland and Wales, and a free Vue cinema ticket each month. We estimate this bundle, if you were to take advantage of all of it every week, is worth about \u00a320 a month. A Greggs flat white is \u00a32, an annual railcard typically costs \u00a330 a year, and Vue cinema ticket prices vary. Access to premium budgeting tools such as virtual cards and customisable pots. Fee-free ATM withdrawals abroad (unlimited in Europe, and \u00a3600 fee-free every 30 days elsewhere. The free account gives you unlimited free withdrawals in Europe, and up to \u00a3200 a month elsewhere. Worth considering You can add family members onto your insurance for an additional \u00a35 a month (\u00a360 a year).The free railcard is only beneficial to those who are eligible with National Rail - for example, for a 16-25 Railcard, a Senior Railcard or a Two Together Railcard. Cost of buying insurance and breakdown cover The challenge with working out whether a packaged account is saving you money is that insurance is notoriously hard to compare in price. How much you will pay for a standalone policy for travel or mobile phone cover varies according to your age, destination and, in the case of gadget insurance, the value of your electronics or phone, as well as the quality of what the insurer offers. Whether you really need it is another thing to consider. All the packaged accounts offer travel insurance with gold-standard terms, including up to \u00a310m of emergency medical assistance, and the majority of policies are rated as best buys by Which?. But they also include add-ons such as winter sports and golf cover, which are not worth paying a premium for if you only ever go on summer cruises or walking holidays in the Lake District. As a guide, a typical average annual worldwide travel insurance policy would cost about \u00a3140 for a family, according to Moneysupermarket.com, and the annual average premium for breakdown insurance bought through the site during the past 12 months was \u00a339. A typical annual mobile phone insurance policy costs about \u00a3100 for just one top-of-the-range phone. This totals \u00a3279. Bear in mind that none of the banks\u2019 travel insurance policies cover you for pre-existing medical conditions, which may mean you end up paying a lot more on top of the monthly fee.",

      "bodyText": "Amid a presidential campaign with foreign policy discussions more focused on the wars in Ukraine, Gaza and Lebanon, the Islamic State stayed under the radar while calling on supporters and operatives to attack Americans on election day. The FBI thwarted a serious plot in Oklahoma City only weeks before the vote, prompting a similar public reaction to news involving the terror group that has become customary of late: is the Islamic State a renewed threat? But the reality is that the terror group has always been one to watch. For the last few years, since the fall of its so-called caliphate, IS was forced to reimagine itself and rallied by restructuring its cells in Europe and reinforcing strongholds in Afghanistan under the banner of the very busy Khorasan (ISKP) branch, and another in Somalia among others. Now IS is primed to be a major thorn in the side of the incoming Trump administration and wants to be active this holiday season, as it has in years past. In the depths of its chatrooms on Rocket.Chat, its chosen encrypted communications platform, IS talk of operations in the west has spiked as Christmas and Thanksgiving approach. \u201cFor the brothers interested in stealing a car and using it in the next attacks,\u201d wrote one IS operative in November, with a YouTube link explaining remote carjacking techniques. Vehicle-ramming has been a hallmark of IS operations, including the 2017 attack on London Bridge and another on a Berlin Christmas market (which involved a stolen truck) in 2016. The terror group recently posted other manuals, one which urged the use of civilian drones as weapons. A flurry of graphic propaganda images in October and November also beckoned followers to act. One image had the slogan \u201ctarget them in their temples\u201d with a knife and a Catholic church in the background, while another featured a Christmas tree and the barrel of what appears to be a Kalashnikov rifle and a hand grenade as an ornament. Lucas Webber, a senior threat intelligence analyst at Tech Against Terrorism, said there was a \u201cheightened [IS] threat to the west during the holiday season\u201d. \u201cISKP has begun setting the information space by releasing threatening propaganda images depicting one of its fighters holding a gun beside a Christmas tree, another urging supporters to follow European terrorists who had conducted recent attacks in Europe,\u201d he said. Though the amateurish IS imagery might suggest unseriousness, there is more than ample reasoning to take the threats very seriously. ISKP carried out a lethal attack on a Moscow theater in March that brutally killed 145 people. Afterwards, the terror group vowed to bring the same level of carnage to an American target. It then released a poster featuring the US Capitol building and the message: \u201cYou are next.\u201d Webber said recent plots involving Somali IS planners show the group has multiple, international vectors of attack. \u201cThe Islamic State\u2019s Somalia branch has been linked to plotters in Sweden, for instance, where the branch\u2019s leader lived for a time,\u201d he said. \u201cIS-Somalia was likewise linked to a bomb plot in Italy.\u201d But the US and its political significance is never far from the brains of IS planners. President-elect Donald Trump, who in a televised event announced the killing of the IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2019, is a common topic of online discussion among its followers and operatives. One IS supporter on RocketChat brought up the assassination attempts on Trump this past summer, which he called \u201clazy\u201d, hypothesizing about the potential for future opportunities. \u201cI believe if somebody is dedicated and smart enough he could do it,\u201d the user went on. \u201cIntelligence and security are human, they can make a lot of mistakes \u2026 It was that easy.\u201d \u201cHopefully one of them is successful,\u201d said another user. IS was a constant talking point for Trump during his first campaign, accusing then president Barack Obama and his administration as being the \u201cfounder\u201d of IS who then failed to stop it. Once Trump did take power it was, in the end, his Pentagon that led an \u201canti-IS\u201d coalition that ultimately eliminated the group\u2019s land holdings in Iraq and Syria. He also sanctioned the 2017 dropping of the \u201cmother of all bombs\u201d on IS fighters in Afghanistan. Now, years later, IS is once again on the march as Trump takes office for the second time. Colin Clarke, director of research at the Soufan Center, believes of all the terrorist organization\u2019s chapters, ISKP will be foremost in the minds of American intelligence officials. \u201c[Right] out of the gate, the threat posed by ISKP should be at the very top of the Trump administration\u2019s priorities in terms of counter-terrorism,\u201d he said. \u201cISKP remains determined to strike the west, and would love nothing more than to launch a high-profile attack in the United States.\u201d Clarke continued: \u201cFrom day one in office, Trump\u2019s counter-terrorism advisers must focus on the threat posed by ISKP external operations. This means looking at ISKP wherever the group operates, from south and central Asia to Turkey to Europe, working closely with other allied intelligence services to share information.\u201d Clarke did say that some of Trump\u2019s national security appointments could potentially antagonize intelligence workers in the US government who are at the forefront of tracking IS, which would be a \u201cpoor way to begin his second term\u201d. \u201cThe intelligence community, including the CIA but also others, are the first line of defense in protecting the US homeland from groups like al-Qaida, Isis and their various affiliates and branches worldwide,\u201d he said.",

Married. Annoyed</a>. Since its launch in 2019, they have turned it into a franchise, publishing a bestselling book and breaking the world record for the biggest live podcast at the O2 Arena. They have two sons and live in South Shields. Their children\u2019s book, There\u2019s a Poonami in My House, is out now.</p> <h2><strong>Rosie</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve got a bib made of paper towels in this photo because I\u2019d just vomited. I\u2019d always thought I\u2019d give birth naturally, so I naively didn\u2019t bother reading up on C-sections. I was in shock when I&nbsp;needed an emergency one, but also on a lot of diamorphine, hence the happy face. Chris looks terrified. Sometimes I&nbsp;think it must be scarier for the partner.</p> <p>After Robin was born, I couldn\u2019t breastfeed. He wouldn\u2019t latch on, and because he was massive, he was starving all the time. A few weeks later, in the middle of the night, Chris went and got me a bottle of formula. Robin finally got a proper meal.</p> <p>Our lifestyle before the baby was party central. There was a lot of going out and a lot of box sets. I was working on the radio, and Chris was gigging. We were only together for two years before we had Robin, so our relationship was still a proper love-fest.</p> <p>Chris and I grew up 10 minutes from each other, but it wasn\u2019t until we were at college that I&nbsp;properly took notice. He loved Arctic Monkeys and had this indie-boy haircut; he was always in white plimsolls, a T-shirt and a leather jacket. I was the sort of girl who wore combat trousers or pedal pushers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I found Chris\u2019s talent very attractive \u2013 he was driven, funny, too.

It\u2019s important to marry someone you fancy, but you\u2019ve got to laugh to get through life. I actually think Chris is quite sane for a&nbsp;comedian.

I\u2019d just finished working at Capital Radio and was doing some mum content on Instagram. I was a bit lost, really, and needed a focus. I knew podcasts were going to be big, but I&nbsp;wasn\u2019t expecting \u201c180m downloads\u201d big. I think it took off because it helps people feel less lonely, especially in the social media age. It\u2019s a relief to hear two people arguing about domestic life when everything online looks so perfect.</p> <p>Having kids is so rewarding, but it\u2019s also the most challenging thing I\u2019ve ever done. Despite all that, I\u2019d give anything to be back at the start again. I&nbsp;miss the simplicity: looking after Robin was my sole focus, I had no emails, none of the usual stresses of life. That being said, once in a while Chris and I get to go away together, just the two of us, for work. As soon as we\u2019re alone, we\u2019re like love\u2019s young dream again. It\u2019s almost a shock \u2013 oh my God, we still love each other after all these years!</p> <p>While what we\u2019ve achieved is amazing, and I love everything we have built, our family is the most important thing. The minute that our marriage feels like it\u2019s failing because of the strain of the podcast, it stops.</p> <h2><strong>Chris</strong></h2> <p>Robin was massive: 10lb. The birth was horrible.

This is where I am. It is where I was born, and where my character was formed. Let me start there. We grew up as four girls and one boy in the house. We had a lot of freedom. We roamed around the farm. We could walk as far and as wide as we wanted to.</p> \n<p>I always knew I would never be anything else than a farmer. If it\u2019s in your blood, it\u2019s there. My father was a potato seed farmer. When I was about 16 years old, the laboratories certified his seedlings wrong. The whole crop was buried. There was no single bag of potato sold. After months, we got this letter that they messed up the samples. There was no virus in this potato seed.</p> \n<p>We tried to recover, but debt swallowed us in. We lost the farm. People ask me how it felt and I said: \u201cListen, this is worse than death.\u201d If somebody dies, you mourn and you bury them. To lose a farm, it\u2019s still there. It\u2019s just not yours. No one should ever go through this.</p> \n<p>I married a farmer, Jan, and we did irrigation farming for 21 years in another area. But in 2004 we bought back this family farm. The guy that owned this farm didn\u2019t want this any more. My husband always told me that he wanted to give my history back to me.</p> \n<p><strong>A few years before this drought started, we realised something was going on.</strong> In 2012, we had a severe flood on the farm, and then no rain for the next five years. It got so dry that you can feel in the air that this is going to be devastating. We are used to seasonal droughts in the Karoo. We plan our whole farming business around this to make sure we can go through this. This one was terrible. This one did not stop.</p> \n<p>In 2017, the bees came to our house looking for food. Bees always find food in the fields. I never had the situation where bees come for help. They came in swarms to have something to eat. We made syrup for them. They are unbelievably happy the moment you put down this trace of sugar. They call more bees. For me, this was a clear sign that there is nothing left in the field, not even a little something left.</p> \n<p>This little river on the farm, which never dries up totally, went totally dry. The fish died. The fish eagles left. Tortoises died. It was stinking of death. We had to feed the tortoises as well. They are shy animals. They\u2019re very on their own. They fed on the little bit of grass left in the gardens. Then it became quiet. It was like the birds stopped singing. The sky was brighter than ever. It was white. Everything was very dry.</p> \n<p>A hydrogeologist told me: \u201cListen, you are in the first phases of a very, very, very severe drought. This is going to be a long one and it\u2019s going to be a hard one. You are going to have water difficulties on the farm,\u201d which we did. \u201cYou are going to have extreme temperatures,\u201d which we did. \u201cYou are going to lose more or less 40% of your grazing on the farm,\u201d which we did due to this drought.</p> \n<p>There are no finances left, so you have to take an extra loan on your farm. All savings go to the animal feed. Everything you can sell goes into animal feed. Most of the time it\u2019s not enough to fill a sheep or a goat\u2019s tummy. You are confronted with hungry and dependent animals. You are worried constantly.</p> \n<p><strong>A lot of animals just give up. Sometimes they are not even thin, they just don\u2019t want to live any more.</strong> They stop eating and they die. As a farmer, you have to throw them away, bury them, burn them. Then another thing is ewes that do not want to raise a lamb. They just decide it\u2019s not worth it to raise this baby.</p> \n<p>The most difficult thing for me as a woman was to stop to try to save my dearest lamb. Previous to this drought, you handfeed them. You\u2019ve got this mother instinct. When you see a baby, it doesn\u2019t matter what baby, you pick it up to try to help it. There\u2019s no money to do this any more.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2023/01/2024-cop/climate-breakdown-reporting-team\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>After that, we had to throw away a lot of dead sheep every single day. It\u2019s like a war. You see your mind switch off. It\u2019s now part of your life, you have to do this. Drought has got a very, very slow way to kill everything. Your hopes, your dreams, your self-esteem, your financial independence. A body can take only so much, a mind can only take so much. Emotionally, I think most of our farmers did have a form of depression. I always say when a farmer goes quiet, then you need to worry.</p> \n<p>This happens in the towns as well. Shops close down because there\u2019s not enough money. The numbers of children going to school dropped because people could not afford to take their children to towns any more. They had no choice but to homeschool their children.</p> \n<p>Farmers could not afford their workers any more. I tried to prevent this with everything I\u2019ve got. A farm is a community. Some of the workers are working with us for 40 years. I\u2019m fortunate we were able to keep all our people. But around me, most of the farms had let go of the labourers.</p> \n<p><strong>I started Save the Sheep, a platform for people to get an alternative income.</strong> We baked 30,000 buckets of cookies and sold them for the farm workers, farmers and wives because you actually made more money with a bucket of cookies than from a sheep. There were farmers and farm workers that did not have enough food on the tables every day, so we supplied them with humanitarian aid, assisted by Gift of the Givers. They also assisted with a project for drilling water on farms, to keep them just afloat. Some didn\u2019t even have drinking water left in the height of this drought.</p> \n<p>I was involved in most of the communities affected by the drought for the best part of three, four years. You become involved in each and every person\u2019s life you\u2019re trying to help. A lot of farmers told me there\u2019s no sense in living any more because they can\u2019t look after their families, their workers, their farms and their animals. We had suicides in some of our areas. It\u2019s not the weak people that do this. Sometimes people think: \u201cListen, if I do it now then my insurance will look after my family. It\u2019s better for me to go and make sure that they are alright.\u201d</p> \n<p>Immediately you feel responsible. I also felt bad for myself because we are in the same boat: our farm, our animals and everything. It was the same. It was not a choice. It was a disaster. It is still very, very real in some areas. I see a lot of farmers getting heart attacks. I think the amount of stress we were put under the last five, six years contributed to the fact my husband had a stroke. It is too much, being responsible for everybody and everything. This has to have a breaking point and it did.</p> \n<p>If a crisis like this one strikes, it is difficult to endure without a strong belief, not only in your own capabilities but also in God. Otherwise, you will not be able to keep going. It\u2019s too much for one person to endure. I think the fact I was involved in all these projects was part of my survival in staying stable as I am. Helping others a lot, making sure that people get necessary extra income possibilities, creating skills. You should never wait for the nation.</p> \n<p><strong>The assistance we received from our government was not enough. I can just say it like it is. We were neglected.</strong> There\u2019s a shame that charities like Gift of the Givers had to step in and do something in order to prevent further job losses and damage to the flocks. We are still creating extra income possibilities. There should be more discussions and plans on how to manage a drought. It\u2019s not an immediate disaster. It stays and it stays and it stays.</p> \n<p>Climate change is now something that we all discuss in fear. If you look back into history, every time that climate changed it had a devastating effect. I don\u2019t know if this is a cycle. Maybe this is an act of God. But the normal years are getting less and the drier years are getting more. I feel that if I knew what was coming, I would probably sell the farm 12 years ago. I don\u2019t know.</p> \n<p>What brings me hope is the kindness of people still out there. You can\u2019t imagine how kind people can be. Disaster is about caring. There\u2019s still people caring about me. It made me aware of the hardship of other people. I\u2019m not selfish any more, not looking at myself any more. It\u2019s time we realise we do not only walk on this Earth to make a living, but to make a contribution towards the future of our children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren.</p> \n<p>My joy for the future will be that we get to a point that we can teach these lessons to the generations to come. To do better than we did with disasters like this.</p> \n<p>You must know that the drought, especially in the Karoo, is the most severe in the world. It changed us. It changed me totally. It is a very thankful area and this is one of the qualities that people who grew up here take to themselves.</p> \n<p>I live in an old stone house with metre-thick walls built in the 1800s. It\u2019s not a beautiful house. But it\u2019s extremely valuable for me. My doors are open the whole day so my dogs and cats can walk and come and go. I don\u2019t even have border fences in front of my doors. It\u2019s not only dry and miserable, there\u2019s beauty here as well. We\u2019ve got stars. Every single night, the most beautiful stars in the world.</p> \n<p><em>This testimonial was produced with the help of the <a href=\"https://climatedisasterproject.com/\">Climate Disaster Project</a>; thanks to Sean Holman, Aldyn Chwelos, Darren Schuettler, Ricardo Garcia, Cristine Gerk, Tracy Sherlock and Lisa Taylor.</em></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Design and development by</em> Harry Fischer <em>and</em> Pip Lev</p></li> \n</ul>",

In 2015 a drought began that would bring the community in which she lived to its knees. The province has been locked in a drought since then. The climate crisis intensified flash droughts across southern Africa in 2015-16, increased the probability of the 2015-17 drought in the south-west of neighbouring Western Cape, and is increasing temperatures in the Northern Cape, as well as decreasing rainfall in parts of that province.

That is the stark conclusion of a new report by the National Oceanography Centre (NOC), based in Southampton, which is pressing for the launch of a targeted research programme as a matter of urgency to investigate how sudden temperature rises in coastal seawater could affect marine habitats and seafood production in the UK. Across the planet, marine heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense as rising fossil fuel emissions force up atmospheric temperatures around the globe, causing the sea to warm. These events not only disrupt shellfish colonies and fisheries, but also cause the bleaching of coral reefs, the spread of harmful algal blooms, the destruction of seagrass meadows, and mass mortality of fish, seabirds and marine mammals. \u201cMarine heatwaves have catastrophic impacts and we need to be prepared for them. At present, we are not and that position needs to be rectified as a matter of urgency,\u201d said Dr Zoe Jacobs, the lead author of the NOC report, Marine heatwaves and cold spells in the Northeast Atlantic: what should the UK be prepared for? \u201cWe need to know how these marine heatwaves are going to affect plants and animals that live in the sea and find ways to protect them, as well as the coastal communities that depend on them.\u201d In early summer 2023 Britain was engulfed in a marine heatwave in which major rises in the temperature of sea water were experienced off the north-east coast of England and off the west of Ireland. For more than two weeks, the sea in these regions was around five degrees above normal temperatures, smashing records for late spring and early summer. The Met Office reported that the North Sea and north Atlantic experienced higher temperatures at the same time, with sea temperatures reaching an all-time high, according to records that date back to 1850. As global temperature continues to soar, scientists believe it is inevitable that many more of these record-breaking heatwaves will affect water around Britain and Ireland in the near future, with the report by the NOC highlighting three main areas of concern. One is in the Irish Sea between England and Ireland, one is in the North Sea off northern England and Scotland, and the last is off the coast of south-east England. \u201cThese regions are areas where marine heatwaves can coincide with extremely low oxygen concentrations in the water, which makes them especially vulnerable. It\u2019s like a double whammy. They get the extreme heat stress and extremely low oxygen levels at the same time.

      "body": "<p>Before I speak to Tim Robbins, the publicist for the series that he\u2019s promoting, Apple TV+\u2019s dystopian drama Silo, politely requests that our conversation sticks to the show and his wider career. No politics please. It\u2019s a brave attempt at reputation management, and also a completely doomed one. Because, well \u2026 this is Tim Robbins! Has there ever been a Hollywood star more associated with the free mixing of performance and politics?</p> <p>This is the man, after all, who was banned, along with his then partner Susan Sarandon, from presenting at the Oscars after using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/25/before-oscarssowhite-five-previous-academy-awards-controversies\">their hosting stint at the 1993 ceremony</a> to draw attention to the plight of Haitians being held in Guant\u00e1namo Bay; who, again along with Sarandon, became a hate figure after forcefully opposing the war in Iraq; and who \u2013 in marionette form, at least \u2013 came to a fiery end as a liberal do-gooder taking on the Team America: World Police puppets.</p> <p>The three fiction films he has directed have all felt strikingly political, too: Dead Man Walking (1995) affectingly told the story of a death row inmate; Cradle Will Rock (1999) considered art and socialism in the roiling 1930s; and, most memorably, the 1992 satire Bob Roberts imagined the political rise of a folk-singing rightwing firebrand, and has regularly been reached for by liberals hoping to making sense of the US\u2019s former \u2013 and future \u2013 president.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLJDR-vFUdY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CLJDR-vFUdY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It\u2019s of little surprise then that throughout our interview Robbins instinctively turns to politics to explain his work, or his work to explain politics, from the prescience of Bob Roberts (\u201cThe warnings about the influence of media on political process were obvious for me back then \u2026 the film still holds its power\u201d) to the parallels between Silo and the pandemic. What\u2019s more surprising is that he doesn\u2019t see the art he makes as responding to politics, per se. \u201c[Making sense of] the political moment, that\u2019s a little boring for me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the social moment, I\u2019m always fascinated by. What the movements of cultures are, how they react to the challenges of their day.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>You go on Netflix right now and you tell me that\u2019s the future of cinema? We\u2019re in big trouble</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When we speak, Robbins first appears as a brown smear: he is running late after a long afternoon bike ride, and is trying to conduct the interview on his phone while cycling, but the camera is facing the wrong way, so all I can see is the muddy road in front of him. To add to the chaos, his phone battery is at a dangerously low level and might cut out at any minute. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of tension here,\u201d he jokes. He does eventually make it home \u2013 battery still just about clinging on \u2013 to the London residence he\u2019s staying in while filming a top-secret project (\u201cI\u2019m here till April, although I can\u2019t tell you why\u201d).</p> <p>When he finally figures out how to work the camera, I\u2019m greeted by a very different figure to the boyish star we all remember from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/nov/25/top-10-sports-movies\">Bull Durham</a> and The Shawshank Redemption. Today the 66-year-old sports a bushy white beard, which along with his tendency to chuckle mid-answer, undercuts some of his more doom-laden pronouncements about the state of the world. (\u201cI\u2019m a big student of history, and we see, unfortunately, mankind always heading towards the same mistakes.\u201d)</p>    <p>Silo definitely fits Robbins\u2019s definition of a show that chimes with the \u201csocial moment\u201d. Adapted from Hugh Howey\u2019s series of sci-fi books, and now into its second series, the show imagines a future where some sort of catastrophe has forced the remnants of humanity to retreat into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/05/silo-review-this-rich-dystopian-drama-is-absolutely-thrilling\">a vast, multilevel, self-sustaining underground silo</a>. There they have been divided by class (those at the bottom of the silo\u2019s 144 floors are at the bottom of society too) and are governed by a series of arcane regulations passed on by the community\u2019s founders. The silo\u2019s history is carefully controlled \u2013 its records were destroyed in some sort of rebellion, and the possession of \u201crelics\u201d \u2013 a hard drive or a camcorder, say \u2013 is strictly forbidden. So too is expressing a desire to leave the silo: do that and you will be made to go outside and face the surface\u2019s unforgiving post-apocalyptic elements, a fate that equals certain death.</p> <p>Or will it? What lies beyond the silo is one of the many big mysteries of a show that resembles a bleaker, more steampunk-ish Lost. \u201cWe\u2019re having a great time [on set], but you would never know it from the tone of the show,\u201d Robbins laughs. Hoping to get to the bottom of these mysteries is Juliette (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/rebecca-ferguson\">Rebecca Ferguson</a>), an engineer on the silo\u2019s generators, who is convinced that she and everyone else aren\u2019t being told the full story of the silo. Robbins plays Bernard Holland, the seemingly kindly head of IT who harbours a dark secret. For Robbins it was a juicy role to sink his teeth into, loaded with real-world parallels.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2018ve always wondered about what goes on inside of someone who has the responsibility of leadership,\u201d he says. \u201cHow they rationalise actions seemingly antithetical to their mission or belief system because of the larger picture; the big lie for the greater good. We\u2019ve gone into wars on this philosophy for years. So I\u2019ve always been fascinated by what it does to a person\u2019s soul.\u201d</p>    <p>Robbins signed on for the show in the summer of 2021, drawn in by its resonance with current events. \u201cImagine reading these scripts when we were in the middle of lockdown,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was like a gift, a blessing, as an artist, as someone who wants to do something that reflects the anxieties and fears of our own society. It seems very close to what we were dealing with on a daily basis at that time \u2013 the lack of transparency of information, the people being told by the government to limit their freedom for the good of all.\u201d</p> <p>Covid, and the institutional response to it, remains a raw topic for Robbins, even as that era disappears into the rear-view mirror for the rest of us. He rails against what he calls the \u201cextreme censorship\u201d of those times, and the effect it had on his industry. He postponed the reopening of the LA theatre that hosts his troupe the <a href=\"https://theactorsgang.com/\">Actors\u2019 Gang</a> for six months due to California state requirements that audience members show proof of vaccination. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe that there should be a litmus test at the door of the theatre,\u201d he says today. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe that that was in the spirit of what a theatre is. A theatre has to allow everyone in, of all faiths, beliefs, political persuasions.\u201d</p> <p>At times his stance has made for some unlikely bedfellows. He appeared on Russell Brand\u2019s podcast in 2022, railing against \u201cOrwellian restrictions\u201d just as Brand was beginning his evolution into the Trump-curious, born-again Christian figure he is today. As such, some have wondered if Robbins might be undergoing some sort of realignment. After he tweeted angrily about the \u201cderanged mindset\u201d of conspiracy theorists claiming that the assassination attempt on Trump had been staged, an article in the Telegraph speculated, perhaps hopefully, whether he was on a \u201cpolitical journey\u201d towards the right.</p>    <p>That seems like wishful thinking. Covid often had an unhappy habit of dividing societies along tribalist lines (\u201cSo politicised, that whole era,\u201d Robbins says), but the truth is that people are more complicated, and Robbins, for the most part, seems animated by the things he has always been animated by. Almost 30 years on from Dead Man Walking, he remains passionate about criminal justice reform: the Actors\u2019 Gang, where he is artistic director, runs a programme that <a href=\"https://theactorsgang.com/prison-project\">aims to rehabilitate prisoners</a> in California through theatre.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A quality movie, a quality television show, will last. Whether it\u2019s a hit or not is irrelevant</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Today he is particularly keen to highlight \u201cinhumane\u201d working practices in his own industry. He is proud that on Silo no one works more than 10 hours a day \u2013 an unusually sensible workload by entertainment industry standards \u2013 and expresses frustration that Hollywood labour unions didn\u2019t push for similar demands during last year\u2019s lengthy strikes. \u201cActors have it easy, they don\u2019t work every day,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen they finish their job they go to have some time off, do a different job. It is crews really that you\u2019re talking about. What winds up happening is that you have people on these crews that are overworked, exhausted, and don\u2019t have the emotional input that one needs to live a rounded life.\u201d</p> <p>He fears for a Hollywood that has been upended by the rise of streaming services, and is increasingly governed by algorithms that prioritise more of the same over anything sui generis: \u201cYou go on Netflix right now, you see what films are coming out and you tell me that that\u2019s the future of cinema? We\u2019re in big trouble.\u201d</p>    <p>Which perhaps explains why Robbins has become less of a regular fixture on our screens. He last made a movie in 2019 \u2013 the excellent, underseen environmental legal thriller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/27/dark-waters-review-todd-haynes-mark-ruffalo-west-virginia-dupont-poison-\">Dark Waters</a>. But for all his reservations, he thinks that good work will still be seen if it\u2019s put out there. His most famous role is proof of that.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re at 30 years now [on from] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/sep/23/shawshank-redemption-30th-anniversary\">Shawshank Redemption</a>,\u201d he says, his eyes widening at the thought. \u201cWhen it came out it got good reviews, it got nominated for Academy awards, but nobody saw it. It was VHS and [Ted] Turner playing it on his television channel [Turner Classic Movies] that changed that. That is a beloved movie. It remains on top of IMDb as the most favoured movie of all time. So I know that a quality movie, a quality television show, will last. Whether it\u2019s a hit or not is irrelevant compared to what people are going to think about it in 10, 15, 20 years.\u201d</p> <p>Robbins these days is thinking about the long game, picking roles that capture the social moment, and hopefully will grow with time like Shawshank has. \u201cThe main thing for me, at this stage of my life, is that I don\u2019t want to waste my time on a set doing something frivolous,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be there for the sake of being there.\u201d</p> <p><em>New episodes of Silo are available Fridays on Apple TV+.</em></p>",

The three fiction films he has directed have all felt strikingly political, too: Dead Man Walking (1995) affectingly told the story of a death row inmate; Cradle Will Rock (1999) considered art and socialism in the roiling 1930s; and, most memorably, the 1992 satire Bob Roberts imagined the political rise of a folk-singing rightwing firebrand, and has regularly been reached for by liberals hoping to making sense of the US\u2019s former \u2013 and future \u2013 president. It\u2019s of little surprise then that throughout our interview Robbins instinctively turns to politics to explain his work, or his work to explain politics, from the prescience of Bob Roberts (\u201cThe warnings about the influence of media on political process were obvious for me back then \u2026 the film still holds its power\u201d) to the parallels between Silo and the pandemic. What\u2019s more surprising is that he doesn\u2019t see the art he makes as responding to politics, per se. \u201c[Making sense of] the political moment, that\u2019s a little boring for me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the social moment, I\u2019m always fascinated by. What the movements of cultures are, how they react to the challenges of their day.\u201d When we speak, Robbins first appears as a brown smear: he is running late after a long afternoon bike ride, and is trying to conduct the interview on his phone while cycling, but the camera is facing the wrong way, so all I can see is the muddy road in front of him. To add to the chaos, his phone battery is at a dangerously low level and might cut out at any minute. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of tension here,\u201d he jokes. He does eventually make it home \u2013 battery still just about clinging on \u2013 to the London residence he\u2019s staying in while filming a top-secret project (\u201cI\u2019m here till April, although I can\u2019t tell you why\u201d). When he finally figures out how to work the camera, I\u2019m greeted by a very different figure to the boyish star we all remember from Bull Durham and The Shawshank Redemption. Today the 66-year-old sports a bushy white beard, which along with his tendency to chuckle mid-answer, undercuts some of his more doom-laden pronouncements about the state of the world. (\u201cI\u2019m a big student of history, and we see, unfortunately, mankind always heading towards the same mistakes.\u201d) Silo definitely fits Robbins\u2019s definition of a show that chimes with the \u201csocial moment\u201d. Adapted from Hugh Howey\u2019s series of sci-fi books, and now into its second series, the show imagines a future where some sort of catastrophe has forced the remnants of humanity to retreat into a vast, multilevel, self-sustaining underground silo. There they have been divided by class (those at the bottom of the silo\u2019s 144 floors are at the bottom of society too) and are governed by a series of arcane regulations passed on by the community\u2019s founders. The silo\u2019s history is carefully controlled \u2013 its records were destroyed in some sort of rebellion, and the possession of \u201crelics\u201d \u2013 a hard drive or a camcorder, say \u2013 is strictly forbidden. So too is expressing a desire to leave the silo: do that and you will be made to go outside and face the surface\u2019s unforgiving post-apocalyptic elements, a fate that equals certain death. Or will it? What lies beyond the silo is one of the many big mysteries of a show that resembles a bleaker, more steampunk-ish Lost. \u201cWe\u2019re having a great time [on set], but you would never know it from the tone of the show,\u201d Robbins laughs. Hoping to get to the bottom of these mysteries is Juliette (Rebecca Ferguson), an engineer on the silo\u2019s generators, who is convinced that she and everyone else aren\u2019t being told the full story of the silo. Robbins plays Bernard Holland, the seemingly kindly head of IT who harbours a dark secret. For Robbins it was a juicy role to sink his teeth into, loaded with real-world parallels. \u201cI\u2018ve always wondered about what goes on inside of someone who has the responsibility of leadership,\u201d he says. \u201cHow they rationalise actions seemingly antithetical to their mission or belief system because of the larger picture; the big lie for the greater good. We\u2019ve gone into wars on this philosophy for years. So I\u2019ve always been fascinated by what it does to a person\u2019s soul.\u201d Robbins signed on for the show in the summer of 2021, drawn in by its resonance with current events. \u201cImagine reading these scripts when we were in the middle of lockdown,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was like a gift, a blessing, as an artist, as someone who wants to do something that reflects the anxieties and fears of our own society. It seems very close to what we were dealing with on a daily basis at that time \u2013 the lack of transparency of information, the people being told by the government to limit their freedom for the good of all.\u201d Covid, and the institutional response to it, remains a raw topic for Robbins, even as that era disappears into the rear-view mirror for the rest of us. He rails against what he calls the \u201cextreme censorship\u201d of those times, and the effect it had on his industry. He postponed the reopening of the LA theatre that hosts his troupe the Actors\u2019 Gang for six months due to California state requirements that audience members show proof of vaccination. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe that there should be a litmus test at the door of the theatre,\u201d he says today. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe that that was in the spirit of what a theatre is. A theatre has to allow everyone in, of all faiths, beliefs, political persuasions.\u201d At times his stance has made for some unlikely bedfellows. He appeared on Russell Brand\u2019s podcast in 2022, railing against \u201cOrwellian restrictions\u201d just as Brand was beginning his evolution into the Trump-curious, born-again Christian figure he is today. As such, some have wondered if Robbins might be undergoing some sort of realignment. After he tweeted angrily about the \u201cderanged mindset\u201d of conspiracy theorists claiming that the assassination attempt on Trump had been staged, an article in the Telegraph speculated, perhaps hopefully, whether he was on a \u201cpolitical journey\u201d towards the right. That seems like wishful thinking. Covid often had an unhappy habit of dividing societies along tribalist lines (\u201cSo politicised, that whole era,\u201d Robbins says), but the truth is that people are more complicated, and Robbins, for the most part, seems animated by the things he has always been animated by. Almost 30 years on from Dead Man Walking, he remains passionate about criminal justice reform: the Actors\u2019 Gang, where he is artistic director, runs a programme that aims to rehabilitate prisoners in California through theatre. Today he is particularly keen to highlight \u201cinhumane\u201d working practices in his own industry. He is proud that on Silo no one works more than 10 hours a day \u2013 an unusually sensible workload by entertainment industry standards \u2013 and expresses frustration that Hollywood labour unions didn\u2019t push for similar demands during last year\u2019s lengthy strikes. \u201cActors have it easy, they don\u2019t work every day,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen they finish their job they go to have some time off, do a different job. It is crews really that you\u2019re talking about. What winds up happening is that you have people on these crews that are overworked, exhausted, and don\u2019t have the emotional input that one needs to live a rounded life.\u201d He fears for a Hollywood that has been upended by the rise of streaming services, and is increasingly governed by algorithms that prioritise more of the same over anything sui generis: \u201cYou go on Netflix right now, you see what films are coming out and you tell me that that\u2019s the future of cinema? We\u2019re in big trouble.\u201d Which perhaps explains why Robbins has become less of a regular fixture on our screens. He last made a movie in 2019 \u2013 the excellent, underseen environmental legal thriller Dark Waters. But for all his reservations, he thinks that good work will still be seen if it\u2019s put out there. His most famous role is proof of that. \u201cWe\u2019re at 30 years now [on from] Shawshank Redemption,\u201d he says, his eyes widening at the thought. \u201cWhen it came out it got good reviews, it got nominated for Academy awards, but nobody saw it. It was VHS and [Ted] Turner playing it on his television channel [Turner Classic Movies] that changed that. That is a beloved movie. It remains on top of IMDb as the most favoured movie of all time. So I know that a quality movie, a quality television show, will last. Whether it\u2019s a hit or not is irrelevant compared to what people are going to think about it in 10, 15, 20 years.\u201d Robbins these days is thinking about the long game, picking roles that capture the social moment, and hopefully will grow with time like Shawshank has. \u201cThe main thing for me, at this stage of my life, is that I don\u2019t want to waste my time on a set doing something frivolous,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be there for the sake of being there.\u201d New episodes of Silo are available Fridays on Apple TV+.",

James Ramsden, the executive creative director at the London design agency Coley Porter Bell, said the rebrand was a \u201cradical reinvention\u201d of a business wanting to appeal to a new generation. \u201cIt\u2019s just a shame it walked away from some of the iconic, treasured, and beautiful icons that have occupied the brand\u2019s DNA for generations,\u201d Ramsden told Adweek. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to \u2018break the mould\u2019, you\u2019d better have one hell of a range of cars full of innovations and shape language, with a new buyer experience, ready to roll \u2026 this we wait to see.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.uffizi.it/en/pitti-palace\">Palazzo Pitti</a> in Florence hangs a painting by Raphael of&nbsp;the Renaissance humanist, poet, scholar, orator and prelate Tommaso Inghirami. He\u2019s pictured at his desk, garbed almost entirely in red, in a typical pose of contemplation, gazing upwards, but look closely at his right eye and you will notice something amiss: there is too much white, as if&nbsp;his&nbsp;eyeball were a shelled egg, its&nbsp;minute pupil dabbed as an afterthought. Inghirami lived with strabismus \u2013 a misalignment of the eyes, possibly caused by his fall from a&nbsp;mule \u2013 and his right eye is almost turned to look behind him, lizard-like. Were one to trace his gaze from those&nbsp;two eyes, extending outwards to&nbsp;see where he was looking, you would draw two lines into infinity, lines that would never cross. Inghirami&nbsp;saw two things at once.</p> <p>I had not heard of Inghirami and his misaligned eyes until I fell backwards \u2013 not from a mule, but in a skiing accident several years ago, cracking the back of my skull against the compact winter ice of a Vermont resort. I had played rugby until the age&nbsp;of 16, and knew how it felt to have a&nbsp;knee or elbow to the head, but this blow possessed its own character: unsettling, strange and electric. I&nbsp;remember thinking, as I got up from that icy slope, that this fall would exact some price, though back then I&nbsp;did not know its currency.</p> <p>Concussions are so commonplace that they often cease to inspire much&nbsp;concern or sympathy, but it is&nbsp;worth recalling the origin of the word,&nbsp;the Latin <em>concussio</em>, meaning \u201ca&nbsp;shaking, or earthquake\u201d. To shake&nbsp;the brain is&nbsp;not the same as to&nbsp;shake the liver or ligament, and sufferers of&nbsp;concussions often exhibit a&nbsp;bewildering array of symptoms: severe&nbsp;headaches, light sensitivity, oculomotor dysfunction and anxiety \u2013 a range that reflects the&nbsp;complicated nature of the brain&nbsp;and its functions. At its mildest, a concussion causes a&nbsp;headache; at&nbsp;its&nbsp;most extreme it can alter&nbsp;perception&nbsp;and cause death.</p> <p>For weeks it felt as if the ground beneath me had shifted. I cowered in my Philadelphia flat, blinds down, ears plugged. Outside my flat, construction workers dug a hole in the pavement, and I wanted to beg them to stop: it seemed that every vibration and noise of the city somehow seeped into my head, unfiltered by any shield or carapace. I slept and slept, and, when I&nbsp;didn\u2019t sleep, I massaged my head obsessively, trying to fix what lay within, stroking the shell to settle the yolk. By week eight, things had settled sufficiently, though I noted with alarm that reading had become difficult, even unpleasant.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>How we read, how we use our eye muscles, matters just as much as what we choose to read</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When we read, we do not usually note the movement of our eyes across the page; it should feel effortless, as smooth as drawing a blade through water, and yet this is an illusion: we in fact shoot our eyes across the page or screen in rapid movements called saccades, before pausing and taking in what we have seen (in so-called fixations). In my case it was as if a veil had been lifted on the workings of my eye muscles, the start-stop mechanism laid bare. Instead of skimming through text, I&nbsp;strained, as if trying to push a viscous liquid through a membrane. I&nbsp;would, much later, discover that my fall had caused a misalignment in my eyes \u2013 the very condition from which Inghirami suffered (though my own misalignment was, thankfully, much less severe).</p>    <p>After my fall there followed a&nbsp;difficult two years during which I&nbsp;struggled to read without headaches, eye strain, light sensitivity and near catastrophic mood shifts. The very thought of reading, associated with pain and distress, began to repel me, and I shunned any text, from lines of poetry to the phrases on motorway billboards. You cannot simply decide not to read: as advertisers know, the impulse to read text is instinctive, and&nbsp;I&nbsp;sought to limit its irresistible allure; I eschewed books, newspaper articles and foreign films whose subtitles, rapidly changing against a&nbsp;screen, caused intense pain. I ceased visiting libraries and bookshops, and instead of talking about books, I&nbsp;talked&nbsp;about concussions, a source of&nbsp;frustration for myself and those around me.

Although I rarely say this phrase aloud, I am a writer, and this loss of ability affected not only my routine and work, but also my sense of self; a&nbsp;concussion is an earthquake, a shaking, but it also involves an unbidden shift in foundations. In the place of text, I tried substituting clay, a&nbsp;material that I&nbsp;had often valued as a&nbsp;metaphor for words: I thought of throwing clay as trying out ideas; pulling clay as actual writing; trimming clay as editing, firing clay as printing a manuscript. I started going to&nbsp;a pottery studio every day, and had earthy ideas&nbsp;that I would become a&nbsp;potter, but it is hard when the thing you use to make sense of something, clay, moves from the periphery to the centre of your gaze. Clay is not text, and my&nbsp;elevation of the material only emphasised its difference and inadequacy. There was also the small&nbsp;difficulty that I did not throw particularly good pots.</p> <p>Strabismus is a common condition (one source estimates that it may affect up to 4% of the adult population), and I&nbsp;sought consolation in the accounts of&nbsp;sufferers such as the&nbsp;comic actor Marty Feldman, and Sartre, who developed strabismus after he caught an infection when he was three. But it&nbsp;was to Inghirami\u2019s portrait that I returned again and again, layering my&nbsp;own desires and insecurities on to&nbsp;Raphael\u2019s&nbsp;oil painting and the biography of this Renaissance humanist. How had a&nbsp;man&nbsp;who was clearly so impaired managed to become the pope\u2019s librarian? In severe cases of strabismus, where the&nbsp;brain receives two images, one eye&nbsp;may become redundant, yet reading must still have been a great challenge&nbsp;for Inghirami. (Sartre would write all over the page, and suffered tremendously from&nbsp;his eye problems.)</p> <p>I studied the portrait, noting not the man, but the objects around him: his pen, inkwell, notebook and book. Inghirami read and wrote not long after the invention of the first printing press; paper was scarce and expensive, and it is not a stretch to say that his reading habits would have differed enormously from even the most disciplined and monkish writer today. If I were honest with myself, I was an overly casual reader, a skimmer, just&nbsp;like many of my generation (perhaps it\u2019s no coincidence that the word \u201cskim\u201d only migrated from dairy&nbsp;to text as late as the 1930s). In&nbsp;truth I was not quite as impaired as&nbsp;I&nbsp;thought; much of my pain and discomfort was tied to the rate at which&nbsp;I passed my eyes over my laptop\u2019s screen. How we read, how we use our eye muscles, matters just as much as what we choose to read.</p> <p>These days I read well enough. At&nbsp;the beginning of this year, an Edinburgh-based optometrist did what&nbsp;no other specialist had thought to&nbsp;try: he tested my eyes for vertical misalignment, in addition to horizontal, and ordered me a pair of prismatic lenses, which bend light to ensure my vision is aligned. I&nbsp;no longer need have such a restrictive textual diet, though I do try to read carefully, respecting my eye muscles and their silent labour. After he survived his accident, Inghirami commissioned a&nbsp;painting of his fall as&nbsp;an ex voto, an expression of gratitude to God. I\u2019m not&nbsp;sure whether Inghirami\u2019s God exists, but this piece is my own ex voto to my optometrist.</p>",

The paradox is, of course, that major climate events are happening more frequently everywhere, yet people are no longer willing to prioritize this.\u201d</p> <p>From an apogee about five years ago, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greta-thunberg\">Greta Thunberg</a>\u2019s ubiquitous activism and talk of massive new green investments, climate has slipped down the agenda for many countries after a pandemic, wars in Ukraine and Gaza, unease over inflation and a rise in populist political figures.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been the perfect storm,\u201d said Fieschi. \u201cEven the vocabulary has changed \u2013 not so much green now, but clean. There\u2019s been a shift in the political balance where climate has taken a back seat to inflation and energy prices. Rather than climate being the existential threat, it\u2019s the Green New Deal that is seen as the threat.\u201d</p> <p>Even though this year is almost certain to be the hottest ever recorded globally, with floods and heatwaves roiling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/31/why-were-the-floods-in-spain-so-bad-a-visual-guide\">Europe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-made-the-deadly-heatwaves-that-hit-millions-of-highly-vulnerable-people-across-asia-more-frequent-and-extreme/\">Asia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/25/las-vegas-extreme-heat\">the US</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/mexico-is-so-hot-monkeys-are-falling-to-their-death-from-trees/\">Mexico</a>, the climate crisis has mostly been a background electoral issue, apart from in India, where <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/climate/modi-climate-india-election.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare\">protests by farmers</a>, whose harvests have been wrecked by extreme weather and unpredictable rains, helped shape a backdrop upon which Narendra Modi won a third term as prime minister.</p> <p>In Europe, rightwing parties that declared climate action to be costly and unnecessary fared well in the EU elections, while in the US, Trump defeated Kamala Harris <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/trump-climate-change-environment-threat\">after making explicit promises to gut environmental regulations and ditch \u201cgreen new scam\u201d climate policies</a>.</p> <p>The trend isn\u2019t universal \u2013 in the UK, Labour resoundingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2024/jul/04/uk-general-election-results-2024-live-in-full\">beat</a> the Conservatives while making clean energy growth a mantra and the far right was unexpectedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/07/exit-poll-shows-surprise-win-for-left-wing-alliance-in-french-election\">defeated</a> in French parliamentary elections. Even in the EU elections, the center-ground parties largely held firm despite the advances on the right.</p> <p>But this year has suggested a sputtering in the global momentum to deal with rising temperatures, amid scientists\u2019 warnings of breached climate targets and the onward upward march of planet-heating emissions.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s misleading to say that there has been a tsunami of populism; not everyone who voted for Trump is onboard with a far-right agenda,\u201d said Jan-Werner M\u00fcller, a political scientist at Princeton University. \u201cBut there are worrying signs. If you look at the center-right actors in Europe, some of them think they should make concessions on climate to make people think they are listening and not going too far, too fast.</p> <p>\u201cThey are making pre-emptive concessions to populism and are reading climate as part of the culture war. But if you repeat the talking points and framing of the hard right you are just making them more powerful.\u201d</p> <p>A troubling year for the climate crisis has been rounded off by a troubled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop29\">Cop29 climate summit in Azerbaijan</a>, which was skipped by most world leaders. It is the third consecutive UN climate gathering to be held in an authoritarian state, and the second in a row, after Dubai last year, taking place in a petrostate.</p> <p>Even though governments agreed last year to move away from fossil fuels, there has been a defiant tone at this year\u2019s summit with Ilham Aliyev, president of the host country, Azerbaijan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/15/fossil-fuel-bosses-get-the-red-carpet-at-cop29-despite-concerns-over-influence\">calling oil and gas a \u201cgift of God\u201d</a> and Argentina, led by the populist president Javier Milei, quitting the negotiations amid speculation the country will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/15/argentina-milei-paris-climate-accord\">exit the Paris climate agreement</a>.</p> <p>The lack of progress in cutting emissions, or in agreeing to climate finance for vulnerable developing countries, has rankled activists. \u201cWe started Cop29 with alarm that the outcome of the US presidential elections would deter global climate action \u2013 apparently, the halls of Cop29 are already flooded with many Trumps,\u201d said Gerry Arances, executive director of the Center for Energy, Ecology and Development, on the paucity of funding from wealthy countries.</p> <p>\u201cWe wonder how governments of historically polluting nations still dare show their faces with claims of climate leadership and commitment.\u201d</p> <p>Even some leaders have publicly expressed similar frustration. \u201cWhat on earth are we doing in this gathering?\u201d said Edi Rama, prime minister of Albania. \u201cWhat does it mean for the future of the world if the biggest polluters continue as usual?\u201d</p> <p>Although this year has also seen progress in the growth of renewable energy and hopes that oil use will soon peak, these ongoing delays and a looming Trump presidency have dampened optimism. \u201cPeople said in 2016 when Trump won that it might not quite be as apocalyptic as anticipated,\u201d said M\u00fcller. \u201cBut now we don\u2019t have any leeway with climate change.

      "bodyText": "An unprecedented year of elections around the world has underscored a sobering trend \u2013 in many countries the commitment to act on the climate crisis has either stalled or is eroding, even as disasters and record temperatures continue to mount. So far 2024, called the \u201cbiggest election year in human history\u201d by the United Nations with around half the world\u2019s population heading to the polls, there have been major wins for Donald Trump, the US president-elect who calls the climate crisis \u201ca big hoax\u201d; the climate-skeptic right in European Union elections; and Vladimir Putin, who won another term and has endured sanctions to maintain Russia\u2019s robust oil and gas exports. \u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that in most advanced economies the big loser of the elections has been climate,\u201d said Catherine Fieschi, an expert in European politics and populism. \u201cIt\u2019s been a bad year for climate and we\u2019ve seen a gradual erosion in the public\u2019s commitment to action for a couple of years now. The paradox is, of course, that major climate events are happening more frequently everywhere, yet people are no longer willing to prioritize this.\u201d From an apogee about five years ago, with Greta Thunberg\u2019s ubiquitous activism and talk of massive new green investments, climate has slipped down the agenda for many countries after a pandemic, wars in Ukraine and Gaza, unease over inflation and a rise in populist political figures. \u201cIt\u2019s been the perfect storm,\u201d said Fieschi. \u201cEven the vocabulary has changed \u2013 not so much green now, but clean. There\u2019s been a shift in the political balance where climate has taken a back seat to inflation and energy prices. Rather than climate being the existential threat, it\u2019s the Green New Deal that is seen as the threat.\u201d Even though this year is almost certain to be the hottest ever recorded globally, with floods and heatwaves roiling Europe, Asia, the US and Mexico, the climate crisis has mostly been a background electoral issue, apart from in India, where protests by farmers, whose harvests have been wrecked by extreme weather and unpredictable rains, helped shape a backdrop upon which Narendra Modi won a third term as prime minister. In Europe, rightwing parties that declared climate action to be costly and unnecessary fared well in the EU elections, while in the US, Trump defeated Kamala Harris after making explicit promises to gut environmental regulations and ditch \u201cgreen new scam\u201d climate policies. The trend isn\u2019t universal \u2013 in the UK, Labour resoundingly beat the Conservatives while making clean energy growth a mantra and the far right was unexpectedly defeated in French parliamentary elections. Even in the EU elections, the center-ground parties largely held firm despite the advances on the right. But this year has suggested a sputtering in the global momentum to deal with rising temperatures, amid scientists\u2019 warnings of breached climate targets and the onward upward march of planet-heating emissions. \u201cI think it\u2019s misleading to say that there has been a tsunami of populism; not everyone who voted for Trump is onboard with a far-right agenda,\u201d said Jan-Werner M\u00fcller, a political scientist at Princeton University. \u201cBut there are worrying signs. If you look at the center-right actors in Europe, some of them think they should make concessions on climate to make people think they are listening and not going too far, too fast. \u201cThey are making pre-emptive concessions to populism and are reading climate as part of the culture war. But if you repeat the talking points and framing of the hard right you are just making them more powerful.\u201d A troubling year for the climate crisis has been rounded off by a troubled Cop29 climate summit in Azerbaijan, which was skipped by most world leaders. It is the third consecutive UN climate gathering to be held in an authoritarian state, and the second in a row, after Dubai last year, taking place in a petrostate. Even though governments agreed last year to move away from fossil fuels, there has been a defiant tone at this year\u2019s summit with Ilham Aliyev, president of the host country, Azerbaijan, calling oil and gas a \u201cgift of God\u201d and Argentina, led by the populist president Javier Milei, quitting the negotiations amid speculation the country will exit the Paris climate agreement. The lack of progress in cutting emissions, or in agreeing to climate finance for vulnerable developing countries, has rankled activists. \u201cWe started Cop29 with alarm that the outcome of the US presidential elections would deter global climate action \u2013 apparently, the halls of Cop29 are already flooded with many Trumps,\u201d said Gerry Arances, executive director of the Center for Energy, Ecology and Development, on the paucity of funding from wealthy countries. \u201cWe wonder how governments of historically polluting nations still dare show their faces with claims of climate leadership and commitment.\u201d Even some leaders have publicly expressed similar frustration. \u201cWhat on earth are we doing in this gathering?\u201d said Edi Rama, prime minister of Albania. \u201cWhat does it mean for the future of the world if the biggest polluters continue as usual?\u201d Although this year has also seen progress in the growth of renewable energy and hopes that oil use will soon peak, these ongoing delays and a looming Trump presidency have dampened optimism. \u201cPeople said in 2016 when Trump won that it might not quite be as apocalyptic as anticipated,\u201d said M\u00fcller. \u201cBut now we don\u2019t have any leeway with climate change. We are running out of precious time. Every day lost matters now.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/weather/video/2024/nov/07/spanish-floods-before-and-after-footage-shows-the-scale-of-destruction-in-valencia-video\">catastrophic floods </a>engulfed Valencia last month, killing more than 200 people, it might seem counterintuitive to think about water shortages. But as the torrents of filthy water swept through towns and villages, people were left without electricity, food supplies \u2013 and drinking water. \u201cIt was brutal: cars, chunks of machinery, big stones, even dead bodies were swept along in the water. It gushed into the ground floor of buildings, into little shops, bakeries, hairdressers, the English school, bars: all were destroyed. This was climate change for real, climate change in capital letters,\u201d says Josep de la Rubia of Valencia\u2019s Ecologists in Action, describing the scene in the satellite towns south of the Valencian capital.</p> <p>In the aftermath, hundreds of thousands of people were reliant on emergency tankers of water or donations of bottled water from citizen volunteers. Within a fortnight, the authorities had reconnected the tap water of 90% of the 850,000 people in affected areas, but all were advised to boil it before drinking it or to use bottled water. Across the region, <a href=\"https://elpais.com/clima-y-medio-ambiente/2024-11-07/un-centenar-de-depuradoras-sepultadas-bajo-el-lodo-las-aguas-residuales-amenazan-con-causar-un-desastre-ambiental-en-valencia.html\">100 sewage treatment plants</a> were damaged; in some areas, human waste seeped into flood waters, dead animals were swept into rivers and sodden rubbish and debris piled up. Valencia is on the brink of a sanitation crisis.</p> <p>For more than a year before the floods, Valencia had been suffering the other extreme of climate change: drought. The two phenomena are connected \u2013 the months of hot weather raised the temperature of the sea and the humidity in the air, resulting in sudden and intense downpours. A year\u2019s worth of rain fell in just 24 hours in some parts of Valencia.</p> <p>Extreme weather is being felt across Spain. \u201cI watched with horror, sadness and astonishment when the floods engulfed Valencia,\u201d says Roser Alb\u00f3 Garriga, a farmer in the mountains of Catalonia a few hundred miles north, who is suffering water scarcity. Recent heavy rains round Barcelona have not reached her area. \u201cIn the last few years, we haven\u2019t had enough water to grow our crops or even to drink,\u201d she says. Sudden torrential downpours do not resolve water shortages, she adds. Catalonia had unusually heavy rains in 2020, followed by four years of drought. \u201cThe truth is that these types of rains cause damage and misfortune,\u201d she says, \u201cbut most of the water just ends up in the sea because the parched land can\u2019t absorb it when so much falls all at once.\u201d</p>    <p>But while Garriga and other Catalans have been suffering water shortages in recent years, there\u2019s one group of people that appears to be immune, and even profits from them: the multinational companies extracting millions of litres of water from the very same land. This isn\u2019t just a Spanish issue \u2013 across the world, from Uruguay to Mexico, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/oct/04/ontario-six-nations-nestle-running-water\">Canada</a> to the UK, many have begun to question whether private corporations should be allowed to siphon off a vital public resource, then sell it back to citizens as bottled water.</p> <p>The tragedy in Spain makes the country one of the canaries in the coalmine when it comes to understanding the global threat to water security. Can the growing number of angry citizens surrounded by private water&nbsp;plants but left without safe water in their homes force a rethink of how this resource is managed? And as weather patterns change, should private companies continue to have easy access to vital reserves of underground water?</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Roser\u2019s mother, Rosita Garriga, places a metal jug of rich, dark hot chocolate on the table, so thick it\u2019s almost like custard. Aged 81, with neat blond curls, she has lived in this farmhouse in the hills of Catalonia since she got married at the age of 18, and is disturbed by the changes she has seen. \u201cThere used to be so many springs here, but now they\u2019ve almost all dried up. There\u2019s been less rain, yes, but I think the water-bottling companies are also sucking it up.\u201d</p> <p>There are six water-bottling plants within a 10-mile radius, including one run by Nestl\u00e9 and another by French multinational Danone. They pump up mineral water from the aquifer beneath the Montseny mountain range and put it in plastic bottles to sell in Spain and abroad. Catalonia has the highest concentration of water-bottling plants in Spain; across the region, <a href=\"https://salutweb.gencat.cat/web/.content/_ambits-actuacio/Per-perfils/Empreses-i-establiments/ambit-alimentari/llista-aigues-minerals-naturals-reconegudes-catalunya/Llista_AMN_reconegudes_Catalunya.pdf\">27 extraction licences</a> have been granted. \u201cThere\u2019s more water carried along the roads in lorries than is running in our streams,\u201d Rosita says.</p> <p>Today, Roser looks after their farm, which is spread over terraces down the hillside. \u201cWe used to feed ourselves all year round. We grew broccoli, beans, cabbage, lettuce, tomatoes, potatoes, plus maize and grass for our dairy cows. Now, it\u2019s so dry, we can hardly grow anything,\u201d she says, pointing to the unplanted beds, as she lets the parched, sand-coloured soil run through her fingers. \u201cI don\u2019t think water-bottling companies are the only problem, but why do they keep taking water when we are running out?\u201d</p> <p>After a short walk up through a forest of chestnut, oak and hazelnut trees, Roser points out the stream that used to be her family\u2019s only source of drinking water. There\u2019s still a trickle coming down, but not enough to keep the pool at the bottom from turning stagnant. This area is called Riells \u2013 derived from the Latin <em>rivulus </em>for<em> \u201c</em>small stream\u201d. But for the last 10 years, Roser has had to drive to a supermarket to buy bottled water to drink. \u201cIt\u2019s a cheek \u2013 the companies are extracting the water from under our feet, and selling it back to us,\u201d she says. Each month she buys 24 five\u2011litre bottles of water \u2013 brands such as Viladrau and Font Vella, produced by Nestl\u00e9 and Danone from local water. \u201cIt costs us \u20ac67 a month. It\u2019s ruining us,\u201d she says.</p>      <p>In nearby villages, it\u2019s a similar story. Nil Papiol is the mayor of Hostalric, a medieval walled fortress town high up in the hills. In an airy town hall room, decked with a red and yellow Catalan flag, he lays a map out on a table. He points out that four bottling plants are extracting water next to the source of the river that supplies the town. When drought hit the region last year, Hostalric\u2019s reservoir ran dry and water stopped flowing from the taps. Papiol, who is young, with a neat clipped beard, chooses his words carefully. \u201cI cannot say whether the extraction of water by the bottling companies contributed to the shortages, but I think it is vital that there is a comprehensive study of the region\u2019s water resources to assess the possible impacts.\u201d Here, too, many villagers had no option but to drink bottled water, effectively buying back water from their own local sources.</p> <p>In February 2024, the Catalonia authorities declared <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/01/catalonia-declares-drought-emergency-extending-water-limits-to-barcelona\">a drought emergency</a>, having suffered 40 months of below average rainfall. This meant 80% of the population of Catalonia, including people in Barcelona, faced fines if they used more than 200 litres a day for drinking, washing and cleaning. Water restrictions were also imposed on agriculture and most industries, but no limits were placed on bottling companies. </p> <p>Pep Camp lives at the end of a cobbled street by Hostalric\u2019s arched stone gateway. He is the head of the residents\u2019 association. \u201cI can\u2019t describe what a shock it was to turn on the tap and see nothing coming out. You don\u2019t know how valuable something is until you lose it,\u201d he says. \u201cSome people say that the bottling companies bring jobs, but we need to understand that water is a scarce resource, it could run out.\u201d</p> <p>This area is known for its streams cascading through damp forests. But after weeks of shortages, Hostalric\u2019s authorities had to connect the village\u2019s water supply to a desalination plant, pumping seawater into people\u2019s kitchens and toilets through pipes running up from the coast 20km away.</p> <p>In nearby Gualba, the local council had to take equally drastic action when their river and reservoir ran dry last year. They connected their taps to a disused marble mine, but found that the water was unsafe to drink. So they paid for hundreds of plastic tubs of water, which were driven up to the village in a constant stream of trucks from January to March this year. Councillor Jordi Esmandia, who was elected in 2023 just as the water was running out, says the stress was intense. \u201cOn Christmas Eve, I was phoning round, trying to find water for the town,\u201d he says. He is convinced that the bottling companies are exacerbating water scarcity. Despite stretching the finances of the village council to breaking point, the tubs of water provided only about half the amount normally consumed in the&nbsp;municipality, so many people in Gualba had to buy their own.</p>      <p>\u201cA company called Aquaservice came round door to door. They offered to install a water dispenser in my house and give me two months\u2019 water free,\u201d says Gualba resident Anita Fornons. \u201cLots of people in the village signed up. Even though the tap water is back on now, we still buy it from them because we\u2019ve signed a contract.\u201d</p> <p>Aquaservice supplies water in big plastic dispensers, like office water coolers, to homes and businesses across the country. It extracts water from four sites in Spain and is owned by American Liquid Packaging Systems, one of the holdings of the California-based venture capital firm Amidi Group, which also owns Chemtex, a company that distributes&nbsp;raw plastic resins for food packaging and plastic containers.</p> <p>Fornons, a singer, is cheery and exuberant, stopping every few minutes to chat or chuckle with a neighbour, as she walks through the village to her allotment. She used to grow lettuce, onions, artichokes, peppers and three varieties of tomatoes for her family \u2013 she has an 18-year-old son and a husband who works in an iron foundry. But for the past three years, the land\u2019s been too dry. Holding out a shrivelled brown bud from an apple tree, she says, \u201cNow we buy vegetables from a&nbsp;supermarket as well as buying water. It all adds up.\u201d</p> <p>The Spanish mineral water association categorically rejects the idea that the industry is contributing to shortages. It points out that mineral water companies use just 0.03% of total subterranean water resources in Spain, according to the Geological and Mining Institute, which is part of the science ministry. \u201cIn&nbsp;Spain, when a mineral water concession is granted, the competent authorities establish a maximum flow rate for use, which guarantees the water level of each spring and, therefore, its sustainability,\u201d it says.</p>    <p>But not all are convinced. Determined to find out how much water the bottling companies were extracting in the Montseny region, Carles Lumeras spent nine weeks this year sitting on the roadside counting the lorries coming out of the plants. A member of the environmental organisation Coordinating Group for the Protection of Montseny, he has been worried about the expansion of bottling plants since the 1990s, but says it is only in recent years, as water shortages have started to bite, that locals have begun to get organised.</p> <p>From 6am to 10pm, he and 15 other volunteers took turns to sit outside four plants around the municipality of Arb\u00facies, including Nestl\u00e9\u2019s factory. They are drab-looking warehouses with towers of blue and red crates stacked in the yard outside. Some companies drill for water directly beneath the bottling factories, others, like Nestl\u00e9, have wells \u2013 locked in little brick huts \u2013 dotted along local mountain paths. The group counted a total of 185 trucks leaving the four plants each day. Multiplying the number of crates of water each lorry carried, they calculated that these four sites were manufacturing 5.6m litres of water a day, equivalent to 1.8bn litres a year. \u201cThat is an enormous amount of water, an enormous volume of plastic,\u201d Lumeras says.</p> <p>While his figures are rough estimates, worldwide it is clear that large volumes of water are being extracted. Last year, 408bn litres of bottled water were sold, and this figure is expected to rise to 425bn litres in 2024, according to data analytics firm Euromonitor International. Despite concerns about plastic use, the volume of bottled water sold has risen by more than 50% over the last 10 years. And it\u2019s big business: last year, global sales totalled US$312bn.</p> <p>Coca-Cola is the biggest supplier of bottled water worldwide, followed by Danone, Nestl\u00e9 and PepsiCo, according to Euromonitor International. These multinationals have been gradually buying up well\u2011known local brands and their rights to extract water from aquifers across the world. In Europe, for example, Nestl\u00e9 owns Perrier and Vittel in France, San&nbsp;Pellegrino and Aqua Panna in Italy, as well as Buxton in the UK. Meanwhile, Danone owns the French brands Evian, Volvic and Badoit, as well as Harrogate Spring Water in the UK.</p> <p>In Spain, there are many local players, but foreign multinationals have an increasing presence. Nestl\u00e9\u2019s two brands, Aquarel and Viladrau, are sourced from Catalonia. Danone produces Font Vella and Lanjar\u00f3n at plants in Catalonia and Granada, while Coca-Cola extracts mineral water for its aquaBona brand from four sites in Spain. This is in addition to the large volumes of water it uses in Spain for its soft drinks. Meanwhile, PepsiCo takes water from a Spanish aquifer for its Aquafina brand.</p>      <p>Nestl\u00e9 says in a statement, \u201cWater stewardship has always been a guiding principle for Nestl\u00e9 Waters, underpinning the business model for each of our factories&nbsp;and for the local communities of stakeholders who rely on these shared water resources\u201d, while a spokesperson for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners says, \u201cWe treat water with the care it deserves and are committed to protecting local water sources. We work closely with local stakeholders to ensure we are protecting watersheds and the availability of water resources. Last year, across Europe, we returned 98.7% of the water used in the production of our drinks.\u201d</p> <p>Across the country, more than <a href=\"https://food.ec.europa.eu/document/download/ec4fbcc0-7185-4dce-820a-27f7e2653dad_en?filename=labelling-nutrition_mineral-waters_list_eu-recognised.pdf\">160 licences</a> to extract water have been granted to bottling companies, including in the hottest, southernmost regions of Spain. D\u00farcal is a village of whitewashed houses and red-tiled roofs, surrounded by slopes of olive groves and almond trees in Andaluc\u00eda. One afternoon in 2006, Rosa Mar\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez was out walking when she noticed lorries and diggers scooping up the pale yellow earth on the hillside overlooking her home. \u201cI was curious, a bit uneasy,\u201d she says. Each morning, when she hung out the washing on her terrace, she would look up and see the diggers there, wondering what was up, until one day she read in a local newspaper that a&nbsp;bottling plant was being built. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. I thought, there\u2019s not even any water here but, oh, they\u2019re digging a well 250 metres deep.\u201d</p> <p>These foothills of the Sierra Nevada look arid, but the&nbsp;Lecr\u00edn valley down below is fertile, watered by the&nbsp;melting snow that trickles down over rocks and through crevices to replenish streams, rivers and groundwater reserves. But, like the rest of the country, Andaluc\u00eda has recently suffered drought, and climate change has reduced the snowfall on the mountains. \u201cThe plant was being built next to the well that supplies the whole of D\u00farcal,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says. \u201cEveryone was worried. A meeting was called in the village and 400 people turned up.\u201d</p> <p>Fern\u00e1ndez has been employed as a rural labourer, a cleaner and a worker in the sprawling industrial greenhouses in the neighbouring province of Almer\u00eda. Now she spends her time looking after her elderly mother and aunt. \u201cI\u2019d never been an activist, but we began to organise protests. We wanted information from the town hall. It&nbsp;was the beginning of a citizens\u2019 movement,\u201d she says.</p>    <p>Despite their efforts, the plant began operations in 2019. It is owned by Aquadeus, a joint venture between the Spanish food manufacturer Grupo Fuertes and the French bottled-water company Alma, which also has several wells in Britain. Fern\u00e1ndez relights the roll-up that is ever-present in her hands. \u201cFrom my terrace, I can see the lights of the plant at night,\u201d she says. \u201cIt pumps up water 24&nbsp;hours a day.\u201d</p> <p>Many D\u00farcal residents believe it is affecting local water sources. Fern\u00e1ndez shows me a well-known local spring that has dried up and a well where the water level has fallen by eight metres.</p> <p>But for Fern\u00e1ndez, worse was to come. By scouring the internet, she and other local activists discovered that two more bottling plants were planned in the same valley. Outraged, she went to neighbouring villages, handing out leaflets warning people of the plans. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Henr\u00edquez, a former policeman, met Fern\u00e1ndez in the village of C\u00f3nchar. \u201cIt was like a doctor telling me I had an incurable disease,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought, why me? We all felt like this. We have a nice quiet little village. We live off the land, we don\u2019t have industries here. Why us?\u201d He wears a T-shirt emblazoned with the logo \u201c<em>Embotelladora, no</em>\u201d<em> </em>(No to the bottlers). I chat to him sitting on the whitewashed steps of C\u00f3nchar. Next to him is Francisco L\u00f3pez, a former postman, whose T-shirt reads \u201c<em>El agua no se vende</em>\u201d (Water is not for sale). They tell me that the residents of C\u00f3nchar and nearby Padul have launched a campaign. They have collected 30,000 signatures on a petition, and held marches with banners reading \u201cStop the theft of water\u201d and \u201cWater bottlers out of our valley\u201d. \u201cThe only good thing to come out of this,\u201d Henr\u00edquez says, \u201cis that our village is more united than ever. We\u2019ve forgotten all our petty arguments and come together.\u201d</p> <p>In total, there are 18 water-bottling concessions in Andaluc\u00eda. The oldest is Lanjar\u00f3n, about 10 miles from Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s village. Its springs were named \u201cmedicinal mineral waters\u201d in 1818 and people have flocked there ever since to drink or bathe in its waters. A commercial bottling plant opened in the 1950s, which was bought by Danone in 1992. Lanjar\u00f3n is still a spa town popular with tourists, its streets lined with shops selling wicker baskets, painted ceramics, almonds and dried figs. The plant has provided jobs there for decades, and Danone helps fund municipal projects. While there has been a&nbsp;vocal campaign in this region against the bottling industry, there have been no protests in Lanjar\u00f3n.</p>        <p>Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ramos, a former mayor of the town, says, \u201cOf&nbsp;course people are happy with the plant being here. It\u2019s the biggest employer and it offers excellent working conditions.\u201d But Danone\u2019s plan to expand the plant has caused unease even among its firmest supporters. It is drilling an exploratory well just above a valley where Ramos and others own plots of land. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned about the company expanding in principle. It would be great if there were 3,000 new jobs here,\u201d Ramos says, \u201cbut this could affect the spring we use to water our olive groves.\u201d</p> <p>Danone says, \u201cWe recognise the challenges facing local communities and the need for long-term solutions to address the impacts of climate change on global water resources. We are fully committed to sustainable water management. The request for further exploration of Lanjar\u00f3n land seeks to ensure access to mineral water in the future, as a preventive measure against the effects of climate change. We understand businesses like ours have more to do. Water is a shared resource, and every player has a role to play in protecting this resource.\u201d</p> <p>For Fern\u00e1ndez, who is now part of the campaign group Platform for the Defence of the Water of Lecr\u00edn Valley, this underlines the wider question at stake. \u201cWho does water belong to? What I am worried about is the concentration of power; the privatisation of a resource like water, which is essential for our fields, for bees, for birds, for water-snails, for all of life.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not just in Spain that people are questioning the right of private companies to exploit springs and aquifers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/uruguay-drought-water-google-data-center\">Protesters banging empty plastic bottles</a> came out on to the streets of Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, last year, when the city ran out of drinking water. After three years of drought, the authorities began to mix diluted seawater into the public supplies, making tap water salty and unsafe to drink. Uruguayans had no option but to buy bottled water, and there\u2019s one brand that dominates the supermarket shelves: Salus. For more than 100 years, a local company bottled this water sourced from a spring in a cavern \u2013 discovered by a puma, according to local legend \u2013 in south-eastern Uruguay. That company was bought by Danone in 2000. Just as in Spain, drought-stricken Uruguayans were buying bottled water from a foreign company that was extracting it from their national territory.</p> <p>The slogan of the protesters was \u201c<em>No es Sequ\u00eda, es Saqueo</em>\u201d (It\u2019s not drought, it\u2019s looting), implying private corporations\u2019 excessive use of water was the underlying reason for shortages. This slogan has been used across Latin America. It could be heard in Mexico, in 2022, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jul/28/water-is-the-real-thing-but-millions-of-mexicans-are-struggling-without-it\">people in Monterrey were complaining they had no water to drink</a> in a drought, while companies such as Coca-Cola were extracting groundwater for their drinks lines, including its Topo Chico mineral water.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/mar/08/tap-water-is-boring-so-they-invent-new-products-how-did-humble-h2o-become-such-big-business\">\u2018Tap water is boring, so they invent new products\u2019: how did humble H2O become such big business?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Britain had a very rainy summer this year, so water scarcity may feel like a distant problem. But the Environment Agency warns that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/18/england-to-run-short-of-water-within-25-years-environment-agency\">England will run short of water </a>within 25 years if steps are not taken. Wales is predicted to suffer more droughts, and Scotland faces increased water scarcity in summer. Meanwhile, multinationals are pumping billions of litres of water a year from natural sources across the country.</p> <p>The United Nations special rapporteur for water, Pedro Arrojo-Agudo, has seen water conflicts increase across the world. He says, \u201cThe commodification of drinking water is immoral\u201d and selling bottled water \u201cis privatising a vital necessity that we all need to live. It\u2019s like bottling fresh air.\u201d Advocating the immediate banning of water in plastic bottles \u201cwhich are an environmental disaster\u201d, he says, we should take a&nbsp;\u201chuman rights-based approach\u201d to water distribution. Governments must prioritise the provision of drinking water to the population, above any private interest, and plan ahead for droughts and other emergencies.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Back in Valencia, hundreds of thousands of people still have no choice but to get water from emergency tankers or use bottled water. The authorities are working hard to ensure there are no traces of toxic chemicals or faecal matter in the water supplies of the worst affected areas. Yet private companies have nine concessions to extract water for bottling from local aquifers in the Valencia region. The majority of these are foreign-owned, such as California-based Aquaservice, the company that touted water dispensers to drought-stricken villagers including Anita Fornons in Gualba. Or Coca-Cola, which pumps water for its aquaBona brand from an aquifer in Requena, a town in the west of Valencia province that suffered some of the heaviest downpours during the recent floods. These private companies have access to underground stores of crystalline high-quality drinking water, which are better protected from pollution than rivers and reservoirs<strong>.</strong></p> <p>In Valencia, as in other areas of the world, a disaster-stricken population has suddenly found itself reliant on bottled water, sourced locally but owned by private corporations. And, as Roser Alb\u00f3 Garriga in the hills of Catalonia has discovered, when global temperatures rise, even the wettest regions can see their habitats change. \u201cWe used to have springs bubbling up everywhere. I never dreamed I\u2019d have to buy water to drink. Last year, we had to ask neighbours lower down the valley to give us tubs of water just so we could wash. So to see trucks drive away from here, full of bottles of water, breaks my heart.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "After catastrophic floods engulfed Valencia last month, killing more than 200 people, it might seem counterintuitive to think about water shortages. But as the torrents of filthy water swept through towns and villages, people were left without electricity, food supplies \u2013 and drinking water. \u201cIt was brutal: cars, chunks of machinery, big stones, even dead bodies were swept along in the water. It gushed into the ground floor of buildings, into little shops, bakeries, hairdressers, the English school, bars: all were destroyed. This was climate change for real, climate change in capital letters,\u201d says Josep de la Rubia of Valencia\u2019s Ecologists in Action, describing the scene in the satellite towns south of the Valencian capital. In the aftermath, hundreds of thousands of people were reliant on emergency tankers of water or donations of bottled water from citizen volunteers. Within a fortnight, the authorities had reconnected the tap water of 90% of the 850,000 people in affected areas, but all were advised to boil it before drinking it or to use bottled water. Across the region, 100 sewage treatment plants were damaged; in some areas, human waste seeped into flood waters, dead animals were swept into rivers and sodden rubbish and debris piled up. Valencia is on the brink of a sanitation crisis. For more than a year before the floods, Valencia had been suffering the other extreme of climate change: drought. The two phenomena are connected \u2013 the months of hot weather raised the temperature of the sea and the humidity in the air, resulting in sudden and intense downpours. A year\u2019s worth of rain fell in just 24 hours in some parts of Valencia. Extreme weather is being felt across Spain. \u201cI watched with horror, sadness and astonishment when the floods engulfed Valencia,\u201d says Roser Alb\u00f3 Garriga, a farmer in the mountains of Catalonia a few hundred miles north, who is suffering water scarcity. Recent heavy rains round Barcelona have not reached her area. \u201cIn the last few years, we haven\u2019t had enough water to grow our crops or even to drink,\u201d she says. Sudden torrential downpours do not resolve water shortages, she adds. Catalonia had unusually heavy rains in 2020, followed by four years of drought. \u201cThe truth is that these types of rains cause damage and misfortune,\u201d she says, \u201cbut most of the water just ends up in the sea because the parched land can\u2019t absorb it when so much falls all at once.\u201d But while Garriga and other Catalans have been suffering water shortages in recent years, there\u2019s one group of people that appears to be immune, and even profits from them: the multinational companies extracting millions of litres of water from the very same land. This isn\u2019t just a Spanish issue \u2013 across the world, from Uruguay to Mexico, Canada to the UK, many have begun to question whether private corporations should be allowed to siphon off a vital public resource, then sell it back to citizens as bottled water. The tragedy in Spain makes the country one of the canaries in the coalmine when it comes to understanding the global threat to water security. Can the growing number of angry citizens surrounded by private water plants but left without safe water in their homes force a rethink of how this resource is managed? And as weather patterns change, should private companies continue to have easy access to vital reserves of underground water? * * * Roser\u2019s mother, Rosita Garriga, places a metal jug of rich, dark hot chocolate on the table, so thick it\u2019s almost like custard. Aged 81, with neat blond curls, she has lived in this farmhouse in the hills of Catalonia since she got married at the age of 18, and is disturbed by the changes she has seen. \u201cThere used to be so many springs here, but now they\u2019ve almost all dried up. There\u2019s been less rain, yes, but I think the water-bottling companies are also sucking it up.\u201d There are six water-bottling plants within a 10-mile radius, including one run by Nestl\u00e9 and another by French multinational Danone. They pump up mineral water from the aquifer beneath the Montseny mountain range and put it in plastic bottles to sell in Spain and abroad. Catalonia has the highest concentration of water-bottling plants in Spain; across the region, 27 extraction licences have been granted. \u201cThere\u2019s more water carried along the roads in lorries than is running in our streams,\u201d Rosita says. Today, Roser looks after their farm, which is spread over terraces down the hillside. \u201cWe used to feed ourselves all year round. We grew broccoli, beans, cabbage, lettuce, tomatoes, potatoes, plus maize and grass for our dairy cows. Now, it\u2019s so dry, we can hardly grow anything,\u201d she says, pointing to the unplanted beds, as she lets the parched, sand-coloured soil run through her fingers. \u201cI don\u2019t think water-bottling companies are the only problem, but why do they keep taking water when we are running out?\u201d After a short walk up through a forest of chestnut, oak and hazelnut trees, Roser points out the stream that used to be her family\u2019s only source of drinking water. There\u2019s still a trickle coming down, but not enough to keep the pool at the bottom from turning stagnant. This area is called Riells \u2013 derived from the Latin rivulus for \u201csmall stream\u201d. But for the last 10 years, Roser has had to drive to a supermarket to buy bottled water to drink. \u201cIt\u2019s a cheek \u2013 the companies are extracting the water from under our feet, and selling it back to us,\u201d she says. Each month she buys 24 five\u2011litre bottles of water \u2013 brands such as Viladrau and Font Vella, produced by Nestl\u00e9 and Danone from local water. \u201cIt costs us \u20ac67 a month. It\u2019s ruining us,\u201d she says. In nearby villages, it\u2019s a similar story. Nil Papiol is the mayor of Hostalric, a medieval walled fortress town high up in the hills. In an airy town hall room, decked with a red and yellow Catalan flag, he lays a map out on a table. He points out that four bottling plants are extracting water next to the source of the river that supplies the town. When drought hit the region last year, Hostalric\u2019s reservoir ran dry and water stopped flowing from the taps. Papiol, who is young, with a neat clipped beard, chooses his words carefully. \u201cI cannot say whether the extraction of water by the bottling companies contributed to the shortages, but I think it is vital that there is a comprehensive study of the region\u2019s water resources to assess the possible impacts.\u201d Here, too, many villagers had no option but to drink bottled water, effectively buying back water from their own local sources. In February 2024, the Catalonia authorities declared a drought emergency, having suffered 40 months of below average rainfall. This meant 80% of the population of Catalonia, including people in Barcelona, faced fines if they used more than 200 litres a day for drinking, washing and cleaning. Water restrictions were also imposed on agriculture and most industries, but no limits were placed on bottling companies. Pep Camp lives at the end of a cobbled street by Hostalric\u2019s arched stone gateway. He is the head of the residents\u2019 association. \u201cI can\u2019t describe what a shock it was to turn on the tap and see nothing coming out. You don\u2019t know how valuable something is until you lose it,\u201d he says. \u201cSome people say that the bottling companies bring jobs, but we need to understand that water is a scarce resource, it could run out.\u201d This area is known for its streams cascading through damp forests. But after weeks of shortages, Hostalric\u2019s authorities had to connect the village\u2019s water supply to a desalination plant, pumping seawater into people\u2019s kitchens and toilets through pipes running up from the coast 20km away. In nearby Gualba, the local council had to take equally drastic action when their river and reservoir ran dry last year. They connected their taps to a disused marble mine, but found that the water was unsafe to drink. So they paid for hundreds of plastic tubs of water, which were driven up to the village in a constant stream of trucks from January to March this year. Councillor Jordi Esmandia, who was elected in 2023 just as the water was running out, says the stress was intense. \u201cOn Christmas Eve, I was phoning round, trying to find water for the town,\u201d he says. He is convinced that the bottling companies are exacerbating water scarcity. Despite stretching the finances of the village council to breaking point, the tubs of water provided only about half the amount normally consumed in the municipality, so many people in Gualba had to buy their own. \u201cA company called Aquaservice came round door to door. They offered to install a water dispenser in my house and give me two months\u2019 water free,\u201d says Gualba resident Anita Fornons. \u201cLots of people in the village signed up. Even though the tap water is back on now, we still buy it from them because we\u2019ve signed a contract.\u201d Aquaservice supplies water in big plastic dispensers, like office water coolers, to homes and businesses across the country. It extracts water from four sites in Spain and is owned by American Liquid Packaging Systems, one of the holdings of the California-based venture capital firm Amidi Group, which also owns Chemtex, a company that distributes raw plastic resins for food packaging and plastic containers. Fornons, a singer, is cheery and exuberant, stopping every few minutes to chat or chuckle with a neighbour, as she walks through the village to her allotment. She used to grow lettuce, onions, artichokes, peppers and three varieties of tomatoes for her family \u2013 she has an 18-year-old son and a husband who works in an iron foundry. But for the past three years, the land\u2019s been too dry. Holding out a shrivelled brown bud from an apple tree, she says, \u201cNow we buy vegetables from a supermarket as well as buying water. It all adds up.\u201d The Spanish mineral water association categorically rejects the idea that the industry is contributing to shortages. It points out that mineral water companies use just 0.03% of total subterranean water resources in Spain, according to the Geological and Mining Institute, which is part of the science ministry. \u201cIn Spain, when a mineral water concession is granted, the competent authorities establish a maximum flow rate for use, which guarantees the water level of each spring and, therefore, its sustainability,\u201d it says. But not all are convinced. Determined to find out how much water the bottling companies were extracting in the Montseny region, Carles Lumeras spent nine weeks this year sitting on the roadside counting the lorries coming out of the plants. A member of the environmental organisation Coordinating Group for the Protection of Montseny, he has been worried about the expansion of bottling plants since the 1990s, but says it is only in recent years, as water shortages have started to bite, that locals have begun to get organised. From 6am to 10pm, he and 15 other volunteers took turns to sit outside four plants around the municipality of Arb\u00facies, including Nestl\u00e9\u2019s factory. They are drab-looking warehouses with towers of blue and red crates stacked in the yard outside. Some companies drill for water directly beneath the bottling factories, others, like Nestl\u00e9, have wells \u2013 locked in little brick huts \u2013 dotted along local mountain paths. The group counted a total of 185 trucks leaving the four plants each day. Multiplying the number of crates of water each lorry carried, they calculated that these four sites were manufacturing 5.6m litres of water a day, equivalent to 1.8bn litres a year. \u201cThat is an enormous amount of water, an enormous volume of plastic,\u201d Lumeras says. While his figures are rough estimates, worldwide it is clear that large volumes of water are being extracted. Last year, 408bn litres of bottled water were sold, and this figure is expected to rise to 425bn litres in 2024, according to data analytics firm Euromonitor International. Despite concerns about plastic use, the volume of bottled water sold has risen by more than 50% over the last 10 years. And it\u2019s big business: last year, global sales totalled US$312bn. Coca-Cola is the biggest supplier of bottled water worldwide, followed by Danone, Nestl\u00e9 and PepsiCo, according to Euromonitor International. These multinationals have been gradually buying up well\u2011known local brands and their rights to extract water from aquifers across the world. In Europe, for example, Nestl\u00e9 owns Perrier and Vittel in France, San Pellegrino and Aqua Panna in Italy, as well as Buxton in the UK. Meanwhile, Danone owns the French brands Evian, Volvic and Badoit, as well as Harrogate Spring Water in the UK. In Spain, there are many local players, but foreign multinationals have an increasing presence. Nestl\u00e9\u2019s two brands, Aquarel and Viladrau, are sourced from Catalonia. Danone produces Font Vella and Lanjar\u00f3n at plants in Catalonia and Granada, while Coca-Cola extracts mineral water for its aquaBona brand from four sites in Spain. This is in addition to the large volumes of water it uses in Spain for its soft drinks. Meanwhile, PepsiCo takes water from a Spanish aquifer for its Aquafina brand. Nestl\u00e9 says in a statement, \u201cWater stewardship has always been a guiding principle for Nestl\u00e9 Waters, underpinning the business model for each of our factories and for the local communities of stakeholders who rely on these shared water resources\u201d, while a spokesperson for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners says, \u201cWe treat water with the care it deserves and are committed to protecting local water sources. We work closely with local stakeholders to ensure we are protecting watersheds and the availability of water resources. Last year, across Europe, we returned 98.7% of the water used in the production of our drinks.\u201d Across the country, more than 160 licences to extract water have been granted to bottling companies, including in the hottest, southernmost regions of Spain. D\u00farcal is a village of whitewashed houses and red-tiled roofs, surrounded by slopes of olive groves and almond trees in Andaluc\u00eda. One afternoon in 2006, Rosa Mar\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez was out walking when she noticed lorries and diggers scooping up the pale yellow earth on the hillside overlooking her home. \u201cI was curious, a bit uneasy,\u201d she says. Each morning, when she hung out the washing on her terrace, she would look up and see the diggers there, wondering what was up, until one day she read in a local newspaper that a bottling plant was being built. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. I thought, there\u2019s not even any water here but, oh, they\u2019re digging a well 250 metres deep.\u201d These foothills of the Sierra Nevada look arid, but the Lecr\u00edn valley down below is fertile, watered by the melting snow that trickles down over rocks and through crevices to replenish streams, rivers and groundwater reserves. But, like the rest of the country, Andaluc\u00eda has recently suffered drought, and climate change has reduced the snowfall on the mountains. \u201cThe plant was being built next to the well that supplies the whole of D\u00farcal,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says. \u201cEveryone was worried. A meeting was called in the village and 400 people turned up.\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez has been employed as a rural labourer, a cleaner and a worker in the sprawling industrial greenhouses in the neighbouring province of Almer\u00eda. Now she spends her time looking after her elderly mother and aunt. \u201cI\u2019d never been an activist, but we began to organise protests. We wanted information from the town hall. It was the beginning of a citizens\u2019 movement,\u201d she says. Despite their efforts, the plant began operations in 2019. It is owned by Aquadeus, a joint venture between the Spanish food manufacturer Grupo Fuertes and the French bottled-water company Alma, which also has several wells in Britain. Fern\u00e1ndez relights the roll-up that is ever-present in her hands. \u201cFrom my terrace, I can see the lights of the plant at night,\u201d she says. \u201cIt pumps up water 24 hours a day.\u201d Many D\u00farcal residents believe it is affecting local water sources. Fern\u00e1ndez shows me a well-known local spring that has dried up and a well where the water level has fallen by eight metres. But for Fern\u00e1ndez, worse was to come. By scouring the internet, she and other local activists discovered that two more bottling plants were planned in the same valley. Outraged, she went to neighbouring villages, handing out leaflets warning people of the plans. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Henr\u00edquez, a former policeman, met Fern\u00e1ndez in the village of C\u00f3nchar. \u201cIt was like a doctor telling me I had an incurable disease,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought, why me? We all felt like this. We have a nice quiet little village. We live off the land, we don\u2019t have industries here. Why us?\u201d He wears a T-shirt emblazoned with the logo \u201cEmbotelladora, no\u201d (No to the bottlers). I chat to him sitting on the whitewashed steps of C\u00f3nchar. Next to him is Francisco L\u00f3pez, a former postman, whose T-shirt reads \u201cEl agua no se vende\u201d (Water is not for sale). They tell me that the residents of C\u00f3nchar and nearby Padul have launched a campaign. They have collected 30,000 signatures on a petition, and held marches with banners reading \u201cStop the theft of water\u201d and \u201cWater bottlers out of our valley\u201d. \u201cThe only good thing to come out of this,\u201d Henr\u00edquez says, \u201cis that our village is more united than ever. We\u2019ve forgotten all our petty arguments and come together.\u201d In total, there are 18 water-bottling concessions in Andaluc\u00eda. The oldest is Lanjar\u00f3n, about 10 miles from Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s village. Its springs were named \u201cmedicinal mineral waters\u201d in 1818 and people have flocked there ever since to drink or bathe in its waters. A commercial bottling plant opened in the 1950s, which was bought by Danone in 1992. Lanjar\u00f3n is still a spa town popular with tourists, its streets lined with shops selling wicker baskets, painted ceramics, almonds and dried figs. The plant has provided jobs there for decades, and Danone helps fund municipal projects. While there has been a vocal campaign in this region against the bottling industry, there have been no protests in Lanjar\u00f3n. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ramos, a former mayor of the town, says, \u201cOf course people are happy with the plant being here. It\u2019s the biggest employer and it offers excellent working conditions.\u201d But Danone\u2019s plan to expand the plant has caused unease even among its firmest supporters. It is drilling an exploratory well just above a valley where Ramos and others own plots of land. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned about the company expanding in principle. It would be great if there were 3,000 new jobs here,\u201d Ramos says, \u201cbut this could affect the spring we use to water our olive groves.\u201d Danone says, \u201cWe recognise the challenges facing local communities and the need for long-term solutions to address the impacts of climate change on global water resources. We are fully committed to sustainable water management. The request for further exploration of Lanjar\u00f3n land seeks to ensure access to mineral water in the future, as a preventive measure against the effects of climate change. We understand businesses like ours have more to do. Water is a shared resource, and every player has a role to play in protecting this resource.\u201d For Fern\u00e1ndez, who is now part of the campaign group Platform for the Defence of the Water of Lecr\u00edn Valley, this underlines the wider question at stake. \u201cWho does water belong to? What I am worried about is the concentration of power; the privatisation of a resource like water, which is essential for our fields, for bees, for birds, for water-snails, for all of life.\u201d It\u2019s not just in Spain that people are questioning the right of private companies to exploit springs and aquifers. Protesters banging empty plastic bottles came out on to the streets of Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, last year, when the city ran out of drinking water. After three years of drought, the authorities began to mix diluted seawater into the public supplies, making tap water salty and unsafe to drink. Uruguayans had no option but to buy bottled water, and there\u2019s one brand that dominates the supermarket shelves: Salus. For more than 100 years, a local company bottled this water sourced from a spring in a cavern \u2013 discovered by a puma, according to local legend \u2013 in south-eastern Uruguay. That company was bought by Danone in 2000. Just as in Spain, drought-stricken Uruguayans were buying bottled water from a foreign company that was extracting it from their national territory. The slogan of the protesters was \u201cNo es Sequ\u00eda, es Saqueo\u201d (It\u2019s not drought, it\u2019s looting), implying private corporations\u2019 excessive use of water was the underlying reason for shortages. This slogan has been used across Latin America. It could be heard in Mexico, in 2022, when people in Monterrey were complaining they had no water to drink in a drought, while companies such as Coca-Cola were extracting groundwater for their drinks lines, including its Topo Chico mineral water. Britain had a very rainy summer this year, so water scarcity may feel like a distant problem. But the Environment Agency warns that England will run short of water within 25 years if steps are not taken. Wales is predicted to suffer more droughts, and Scotland faces increased water scarcity in summer. Meanwhile, multinationals are pumping billions of litres of water a year from natural sources across the country. The United Nations special rapporteur for water, Pedro Arrojo-Agudo, has seen water conflicts increase across the world. He says, \u201cThe commodification of drinking water is immoral\u201d and selling bottled water \u201cis privatising a vital necessity that we all need to live. It\u2019s like bottling fresh air.\u201d Advocating the immediate banning of water in plastic bottles \u201cwhich are an environmental disaster\u201d, he says, we should take a \u201chuman rights-based approach\u201d to water distribution. Governments must prioritise the provision of drinking water to the population, above any private interest, and plan ahead for droughts and other emergencies. * * * Back in Valencia, hundreds of thousands of people still have no choice but to get water from emergency tankers or use bottled water. The authorities are working hard to ensure there are no traces of toxic chemicals or faecal matter in the water supplies of the worst affected areas. Yet private companies have nine concessions to extract water for bottling from local aquifers in the Valencia region. The majority of these are foreign-owned, such as California-based Aquaservice, the company that touted water dispensers to drought-stricken villagers including Anita Fornons in Gualba. Or Coca-Cola, which pumps water for its aquaBona brand from an aquifer in Requena, a town in the west of Valencia province that suffered some of the heaviest downpours during the recent floods. These private companies have access to underground stores of crystalline high-quality drinking water, which are better protected from pollution than rivers and reservoirs. In Valencia, as in other areas of the world, a disaster-stricken population has suddenly found itself reliant on bottled water, sourced locally but owned by private corporations. And, as Roser Alb\u00f3 Garriga in the hills of Catalonia has discovered, when global temperatures rise, even the wettest regions can see their habitats change. \u201cWe used to have springs bubbling up everywhere. I never dreamed I\u2019d have to buy water to drink. Last year, we had to ask neighbours lower down the valley to give us tubs of water just so we could wash. So to see trucks drive away from here, full of bottles of water, breaks my heart.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us today, thanks for your company and correspondence. Time to knock this OBO cat humanely on its rock hard head. We\u2019ll be back for day three tomorrow for what is normally known as \u2018moving day\u2019 although India have already manoeuvred themselves into a commanding position in Perth. Toodles! Here is Geoff Lemon\u2019s report of day two of the first Test: While we wait for the full report of day two in Perth, here\u2019s one Barney Ronay made earlier: That\u2019s yer lot. What a day for India, they finish day two in the ascendancy with KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal\u2019s unbeaten opening partnership making the Aussies toil. Excellent Alpha-ing from Virat Kohli at the close as he strolls out onto the pitch in his pads and beats his bat with his glove in applause of his teammates. \u201cI\u2019m still to come, cobbah!\u201d The players walk off under darkening shadows, Australia will have to lick/ice their wounds and then come again tomorrow. Oh, btw, Marnus sent down the final over and bowled shithouse medium pace but managed to surprise KL Rahul with a slippery bouncer that spat if not like a camel then certainly a shetland pony in a tizz. 57th over: India 172-0 (Jaiswal 90, Rahul 62) 56th over: India 171-0 (Jaiswal 89, Rahul 62) Lyon twiddles a maiden, one over left in the day. 55th over: India 171-0 (Jaiswal 89, Rahul 62) Jaiswal nudges nearer to three figures but loses his shape attempting a Hollywood drive to Pat Cummins. Lucky not to get a tickle. It\u2019s the little things eh Eamonn Maloney? \u201cI for one appreciate the effort to cite the Australian version of that biscuit when you have one of your own. But we haven\u2019t had a crumb here today\u2026\u201d 54th over: India 169-0 (Jaiswal 88, Rahul 59) Three singles off Lyon, not long left now in Perth, we\u2019re into the dregs of the day. But good dregs. Like a TimTam dropped in the bottom of your brew. It\u2019s been such an enjoyable day of Test cricket. Both sides have dug in and given it their all. Rahul and Jaiswal have been monumental, can the latter get to a well deserved ton before the close? 53rd over: India 166-0 (Jaiswal 88, Rahul 59) Cummins slides a full ball down the leg side to leave Carey no chance behind the stumps, four more runs to India to go with a single each to Jaiswal and Rahul. India\u2019s lead is up to 215. 52nd over: India 160-0 (Jaiswal 87, Rahul 58) Up, Up and Away! Jaiswal shimmies down to a length delivery from Lyon and swats it over long on for SIX into the stands. The tv coverage clocking it at over 100 metres and I\u2019m not totally convinced he even middled it. That\u2019s Jaiswal\u2019s 34th six this calendar year, he now holds the record on his own after sitting level with some bloke called Brendon McCullum on 33. 51st over: India 151-0 (Jaiswal 79, Rahul 57) It\u2019s not your day, Patty. Cummins finds the edge of Jaiswal\u2019s blade but the nick flies between slip and gully and away for four! 50th over: India 145-0 (Jaiswal 74, Rahul 56) Pat Cummins turns to the ursine Travis Head and his loopy leg spin. India don\u2019t take the bait, instead opting to work the newbie around to collect 8 easy runs off the over. David Warner has just said on commentary that this is one of those days that Australia just need to \u201cwrite off\u201d. That\u2019s all you need to know about how dominant India have been this afternoon. 49th over: India 137-0 (Jaiswal 72, Rahul 50) Cummins replaces Starc, who has presumably gone for a lie down in a darkened room. A wild bouncer is thudded into the pitch and it flies away over Alex Carey for four. Make that five wides. 48th over: India 131-0 (Jaiswal 71, Rahul 50) Five runs worked off Marsh\u2019s latest. This is painful for Australia, make no mistake. Shadows creeping across the outfield. Rahul gets the single he needs to make fifty, the crowd give him a decent ovation too. 47th over: India 126-0 (Jaiswal 67, Rahul 49) Starc slams one down and Jaiswal flicks it away off his legs for SIX! What a shot from the youngster. Starc glowers, looking every inch the bulldog licking you-know-what off some nettles. Starc responds with a fully fledged jaffa that seams away after pitching, leaving Jaiswal groping and grasping. The batter wisely gets off the mark next ball. Shot! KL Rahul goes to the cusp of a half century with a cover drived pinged through the covers. Starc is tiiiiiicking. Me old mucka Jon Hotten sends a message, *something about James Vince. Again. Nurse! *Just kidding Jonboy. He\u2019s referring to this of course. Have a gander why dontcha. 46th over: India 115-0 (Jaiswal 60, Rahul 45) Marsh nearly scuttles one through Rahul, I\u2019ll have you know that ball kept low! KL did well to jam his bat down in time. 45th over: India 114-0 (Jaiswal 59, Rahul 45) Starc serves up a half volley that KL Rahul pounces on, driving down the ground for three runs. Jaiswal nudges a quick single into the leg side to add to the tall left armer\u2019s chagrin. Juggernaut frown indeed. 44th over: India 110-0 (Jaiswal 58, Rahul 42) Mitch Marsh into the attack. Hello Gruesome! Jaiswal greets him with a superb late cut for four. 43rd over: India 106-0 (Jaiswal 54, Rahul 42) The players take their final drinks break of the day after Starc\u2019s latest over costs just a single worked off the hip by Jaiswal. Hard yakka for the Aussies. \u201cInteresting to read that we sent the bindii weed to Australia.\u201d Types Jonah Sack from South Africa. \u201cOver here they\u2019re called duiweltjies or duibeltjies (\u201cday-bill-key\u201d) \u2014 meaning \u201clittle devils\u201d. They absolutely will go straight through a flip-flop and into your foot.\u201d Spoken like a man who knows, Jonah. 42nd over: India 105-0 (Jaiswal 53, Rahul 42) Some shonky calling sees KL Rahul nearly run out at the non-strikers end looking for a single that Jaiswal had no interest in. That would have taken the edge off the dropped catch last over. A much more existent single is collected off the final ball with a drive down to long on. 41st over: India 104-0 (Jaiswal 52, Rahul 42) DROP! Australia did not, repeat NOT, need that. Mitch Starc replaces Josh Hazelwood and entices Jaiswal into a booming drive on the walk. The edge goes low to Usman Khawaja at first slip, it just about carries on the full but Khawaja spills it down by his toes. Tough chance but eminently catchable and has to go down as a drop. 40th over: India 102-0 (Jaiswal 51, Rahul 41) A maiden from Lyon but a leg bye scampered. \u201cHi James, lovely to see Tommy Hafey on OBO.\u201d And you too, Peter Salmon. \u201cCan\u2019t not mention that he was a one of the gentlemen of Australian sport, but also legendary for his fitness. Aged 83 he was still starting each day by getting up at 5 am then running 10km, swimming 4km and then doing 500 push-ups, 300 sit-ups and 200 leg raises. Only ever wore t-shirts, whatever the weather, which can get bitterly cold in Melbourne winter. He was, in fact, as hard as a cat\u2019s head.\u201d This is just a normal morning\u2019s work surely? Chop chop Peter, you\u2019ve still got your 200 leg raises to do. 39th over: India 101-0 (Jaiswal 51, Rahul 41) Hazelwood zips one past Jaiswal\u2019s outside edge, the batter drawn in to fencing at the final ball of another maiden over. \u201cMorning James, how goes it?\u201d Bleary eyed but content, Guy Hornsby, thanks for asking. \u201cA cold and soporific morning in South Manchester, cricket on, cup of tea. I don\u2019t mind winter, you know\u2026 \u201cLoved the Elbow reference earlier. Guy Garvey is a hugely underrated lyricist. A gruff, Mancunian bars, if you will, with a couplet for every situation. Great Expectations, from their 2005 album, Leaders Of The Free World, seems to feel like it\u2019s talking cricket to me. There\u2019s meaning in everything, if you look for it. And if it rains all day Call on you, I\u2019ll call on you Like I used to Slide down beside and wrap you in stories\u201d Here, here. Skip to 3.25 mins on this for some more soporific morning loveliness. 38th over: India 101-0 (Jaiswal 51, Rahul 41) Jaiswal nudges a single and goes to a brilliant half century. He barely pays it any heed, mind. A sure sign that he\u2019s got his sights set on bigger things. Rahul then works around the corner to bring up the hundred stand between the Indian opening pair. The lead is 147 runs. Gulp. 37th over: India 99-0 (Jaiswal 49, Rahul 40) Eeeesht! Hazlewood is this close from getting the breakthrough as he beats Jaiswal\u2019s edge with a beauty that holds its line. Alan Holinghurst would have been proud of that one. \u201cI would have thought the business end of a cat o\u2019 nine tails. Certainly hard enough to take\u201d chimes Bob Mills. No further comments your honour. \u201cGidday\u201d writes Ross McGillivray on the subject of cat heads. \u201cThis was a favoured expressing of the legendary Australian football coach Tom Hafey. He particularly liked tough players and this was one of his highest accolades, another for the brave players was \u201che\u2019s got a heart as big as himself\u201d Lovely stuff, thanks Ross. 36th over: India 97-0 (Jaiswal 48, Rahul 40) Lyon lands it on a postage stamp for five balls before offering a slight bit of width that Jaiswal punches off the back foot through cover for a single. 35th over: India 96-0 (Jaiswal 47, Rahul 40) Josh Hazlewood changes ends and completes his fourth maiden out of the eight overs he\u2019s bowled. Righto, on to matters of feline skull density\u2026 or is it? \u201cSuspect it may be cat head rather than cat\u2019s head\u201d emails Craig Lawler. \u201cThey are a notorious vicious type of bindi (*weeds to us Brits), also known as caltrop. They dry into an infernal device that sticks into feet to spread. They came from South Africa originally but now a feature in drier parts of Australia. They are very hard, their spikes will stick into hard wood and through thongs.\u201d (*flip flops to us Brits) 34th over: India 96-0 (Jaiswal 47, Rahul 40) India\u2019s openers tick towards the unbroken 100 stand. I think this is their biggest opening partnership on Aussie soil for twenty years. If that doesn\u2019t do for them then I don\u2019t know what will. 33rd over: India 93-0 (Jaiswal 46, Rahul 38) Cummins goes around the wicket to the right handed Rahul. Four dots and then a swivel pull for a single out to the deep. Jaiswal stands tall and drives down the ground for a couple. 32nd over: India 90-0 (Jaiswal 44, Rahul 37) Lyon wheels in with a slip and short leg in place. Rahul sits deep in his crease and glides away for a single. Cat\u2019s head updates incoming. 31st over: India 89-0 (Jaiswal 44, Rahul 36) Jaiswal drives Cummins through mid off for a couple. India\u2019s openers have been cautious since the tea break. Josh Hazlewood is being hoicked after just a couple of miserly overs. Nathan Lyon is coming on for a twirl. 30th over: India 87-0 (Jaiswal 42, Rahul 36) Hazlewood does his thing, a maiden cobwebbed together to a watchful KL Rahul. 29th over: India 87-0 (Jaiswal 42, Rahul 36) Cummins tests out the middle of the pitch with some short stuff. Rahul is up to the challenge, swatting away on the pull for a single. Jaiswal sways inside the line of another bouncer with apparent ease, that won\u2019t please big Pat. Toil and trouble for Australia in Perth. David Meiklejohn doesn\u2019t mind it. \u201cEnjoying watching Jaiswal batting, especially his old fashioned and eminently sensible tactic of swaying out of the way of the short ball, rather than ducking.\u201d 28th over: India 85-0 (Jaiswal 42, Rahul 35) Josh Hazlewood from t\u2019other end, Rahul works off his pads for a single. It\u2019s the only run off the over as Mr Metronome joins the dots and beats Jaiswal with one that nips away late. 27th over: India 84-0 (Jaiswal 42, Rahul 34) The players start over after tea. Pat Cummins takes the orb and sends down a thrifty maiden to KL Rahul. Just chatting with m\u2019colleague Martin Pegan about the phrase \u2018harder than a cat\u2019s head\u2019 to describe the firmness of the pitch. I have to say it is one of my favourites. I thought it was an Aussie cricketing expression but Mart thinks it might be AFL? Any OBOers out there got the skinny? It makes me think of this song and the lyric \u2018Cramming commitments like cats in a sack\u2019 which is just a fantastic line. My phone peeps, a text comes through from my beloved who is on an early flight out of Gatwick, about to embark on a weekend of pizza consumption and wistful volcano gazing in Naples and its environs. Juggernaut brow you say, a man of my calibre? Never. Jaiswal and Rahul head off the field to put their pads up, India in control in Perth. The Aussie commentators were just talking about Yashasvi Jaiswal\u2019s origin story. If you\u2019ve not heard it then it\u2019s definitely worth it, I tried to do it justice a while back with this piece: 26th over: India 84-0 (Jaiswal 42, Rahul 34) Nope. Lyon goes around and over forward and backward and over the Irish sea but can\u2019t get the wicket Australia crave. Each opener nudges a single to take the India lead to 130 runs. That\u2019s Tea Folks. 25th over: India 82-0 (Jaiswal 41, Rahul 33) Here\u2019s Maaaaaarnus. Or \u2018Rashid Marn\u2019 as he is apparently calling himself when he bowls. I do mind it and the umpires mind him following through in the red zone. He bookends the over with leg spinning bouncers that pitch in his own half. You heard. A Rahul single ticks us onwards. There will be one more over from Lyon before tea. Can Australia prise a wicket to go with their cucumber sangers? 24th over: India 81-0 (Jaiswal 41, Rahul 32) Jaiswal trots down to Lyon once more and bails out once more. Lyon gives him a glare and a bit of a teapot. How very dare you. Jaiswal pays him never mind, rocks back into his crease and slaps for two into the off side like an 80s bassist. 23rd over: India 79-0 (Jaiswal 39, Rahul 39) Starc is zeroing in on the stumps, more full stuff at Rahul who hangs back and manages to work away for a couple. India\u2019s lead is up to 125 runs as this warp speed game continues to intrigue. 22nd over: India 75-0 (Jaiswal 38, Rahul 29) Lyon wheels away, bald pate gleaming under the mid-afternoon sun. Jaiswal advances but realises he\u2019s going to get beaten in the flight and adjusts accordingly. Back to back maidens, what is this, a Test match? 21st over: India 75-0 (Jaiswal 38, Rahul 29) DotfollowsDotfollowsDotfollowsDotfollowsDotfollowsDot as Mitch Starc stitches together a lesser spotted maiden to KL Rahul. A Starc special toe crusher is well dug out by the batter and he survives the examination. 20th over: India 75-0 (Jaiswal 38, Rahul 29) Three singles collected off Lyon with no alarms and indeed, no surprises. It looks hot in Perth, in contrast, the sky is the colour of black treacle here in Derbyshire and the ground is pockmarked with snow. Wish you were here? 19th over: India 72-0 (Jaiswal 37, Rahul 27) Rahul opens the face to pick up three more behind square on the off side and then \u2013 Hello Dolly \u2013 Jaiswal plays a \u2018no look\u2019 slog sweep to a Starc ball on leg stump from deep in his crease, the ball soaring over the leg side and bouncing over the rope. It is not dull. India stretch their lead, Nathan Lyon is being summoned. 18th over: India 65-0 (Jaiswal 33, Rahul 24) Jaiswal is on the walk, heading down the wicket towards Marsh and clipping to the leg side. Marsh proving a danger with his slightly slower pace, sliding the ball past Jaiswal\u2019s outside edge as the batter trots down once more. Four runs off the over. Australia need a wicket, pronto. 17th over: India 61-0 (Jaiswal 32, Rahul 22) Starc replaces Cummins and stitches together five dots before Jaiswal blots his copybook with a delicious cover drive. That\u2019s five boundaries in the last five overs by my count. Don\u2019t trust my count, i\u2019m disgracefully sleep deprived. Messrs Jaiswal, Rahul and Douwe Egberts doing the trick though. 16th over: India 57-0 (Jaiswal 28, Rahul 22) Marsh bustles in, resembling a tool chest hurtling down a staircase. He takes Jaiswal\u2019s glove with a short of a length delivery but the contact is meaty enough that the ball dies in front of the cordon. There\u2019s the 100 lead for India, KL Rahul flashes a loose ball away to the point boundary. Thanks Geoff, and hello all. Quick question - are you very kind, kind, fairly kind or not at all kind to animals English OBOers? Cummins steams in and is driven for a brace through cover and then late upper cut over the keeper by Jaiswal for four runs. This kid, eh? The baby faced assassin then collects three to backward point with an insouciant glide. Nine off the over! India ticking. 15th over: India 52-0 (Jaiswal 27, Rahul 18) 14th over: India 43-0 (Jaiswal 18, Rahul 18) Mitch Marsh comes on for a bowl, and unlike the first innings where he struck gold early, his second ball gets pasted for four. Solid pull shot from KL. That\u2019s after a Jaiswal single, and before KL scores two more with a glance, and then Marsh bowls a no-ball. How the tides tide. Eight from an over! In this Test match! That is it for me. Next up, be nice to him, James Wallace. 13th over: India 35-0 (Jaiswal 17, Rahul 12) There\u2019s a boundary! More convincing from Rahul, who gets forward to a fuller Cummins ball and plays the on drive with style. That\u2019s after Jaiswal gave him the strike. Drinks. Ashley Baker writes in with an update. \u201cIn reply to the query about watching the match outside Australia, the ABC radio feed is accessible from here in Japan. No pictures though.\u201d 12th over: India 30-0 (Jaiswal 16, Rahul 8) Big shot from Jaiswal! Doesn\u2019t connect, but he tries to boom through cover. Travis Head is immediately pushed back to the deep square of the wicket on the off side. Jaiswal settles for a single later in the Starc over. 11th over: India 29-0 (Jaiswal 15, Rahul 8) Three maidens in a row, ended as Rahul pulls a single from Cummins to fine leg. Another single for Jaiswal flicked to leg. 10th over: India 27-0 (Jaiswal 14, Rahul 7) The lead is out to 73 now. Perhaps today and tomorrow will be easier for batting, so the teams might need to recalibrate their expectations after the two low first innings. Bigger runs could be coming, but for Australia the pitch is likely to get more variable and difficult late in the game. So they can\u2019t afford to give India all of today and a lot of tomorrow, if it plays like last year and gets erratic by day four. Hazlewood bowls another maiden, including a good bouncer at Jaiswal. 9th over: India 27-0 (Jaiswal 14, Rahul 7) Cummins with his second over, and again no alarms for India. Rahul very watchful, leaves whenever he can. 8th over: India 27-0 (Jaiswal 14, Rahul 7) Another edge from Hazlewood\u2019s bowling, again on the bounce into the cordon. Jaiswal isn\u2019t fazed, leaves and defends the rest of the over. 7th over: India 27-0 (Jaiswal 14, Rahul 7) Cummins replacing Starc for the 7th over, when in the first innings he replaced Hazlewood in the 8th. Interesting. Gives Jaiswal a ball a touch too short and the opener places it through backward point for four! Just puts the bat there, eased. Then a single into the off side. Up to 15 and looking comfortable. 6th over: India 22-0 (Jaiswal 10, Rahul 7) Hazlewood carrying on, and this is good batting from the Indian openers, three times taking sharp singles by just dropping the ball away. They\u2019re not trapped like they were in the first dig. Though Rahul did battle through that period when it was toughest, he\u2019s scored more freely today, even for a handful of runs. 5th over: India 19-0 (Jaiswal 8, Rahul 6) Starc bowling to KL Rahul, who picks off a couple of fuller ones to the leg side, two runs and then one. Jaiswal goes through the off side for a couple. This suddenly seems manageable for India, compared to the first innings. But a good ball can still do plenty. Another leg bye to end the over. \u201cGeoff, do you know if the test is free to view anywhere online? (my alternative version of asking for the TMS link!) Ten million thanks,\u201d says Andrew Benton. Not sure about Hong Kong. Games do get screened in some overseas territories in unusual configurations. Within Australia there\u2019s nothing free online \u2013 Seven have the free-to-air analogue rights but Fox own the digital rights and hence the streaming. 4th over: India 13-0 (Jaiswal 5, Rahul 3) Nicked in front of slip! Rahul manages to get the ball to die on its way to the cordon, as he did several times yesterday. Rahul off the mark with two, another cover drive that slows along the grass as also happened several times yesterday. Other grounds that might be skating for four. Plays a pull shot for one run, behind square. 3rd over: India 10-0 (Jaiswal 5, Rahul 0) Boundary for Jaiswal! Glances four, and that makes him feel better after a smearing pull shot attempt went nowhere near the ball. Eamonn Maloney is pondering. \u201cNo 11 is cricket\u2019s equivalent of that alarming stat about the number of men who reckon they could get a point (game?) off Serena Williams. You sometimes find yourself lulled into thinking, could I? And then every so often they play an innings (even one of 20 balls) that reminds you that you absolutely could not.\u201d I think the survey was about a point, not a game, but even that \u2013 no chance, except for a double fault. Yes, you look at where Test 11s bat when they play club cricket. Plenty of them are comfortably top order. 2nd over: India 6-0 (Jaiswal 1, Rahul 0) Hazlewood to Jaiswal, across the left-hander, and testing him out a couple of times. Jaiswal on a pair, as are several players in this match. But he gets off his! Drops the ball away to leg and scurries through, and Rahul is able to get just enough in the way of a ball that skims off his pad to the fine leg boundary for four leg byes. \u201cAfternoon Geoff,\u201d writes Phil Withall. \u201cFascinating match, made more so for me due to my working environment. As an English chef working in Queensland I\u2019ve the pleasure of working with an Aussie and an Indian, the last two days have been wonderfully enjoyable, as they spend most of the shift making sarcastic comments to each other. Particularly enjoyable for the neutral...\u201d The kitchen might heat up next summer, Phil\u2026 1st over: India 1-0 (Jaiswal 0, Rahul 0) Mitchell Starc has had 40 minutes to grab a shower and a feed and a tub of cold drinks, and now he\u2019s swapped bat for the new ball. Jaiswal drives with power first ball, but Starc stops it himself. Doing everything. India\u2019s score gets underway with a leg bye into the leg side. KL Rahul on strike, who batted so well in the first innings and got a bit unlucky, I reckon\u2026 can\u2019t see how the third umpire can give a caught behind when there\u2019s no footage of the exact spot where the ball passes bat. The frame wasn\u2019t there for that decision, in my interpretation. Can\u2019t be assuming or guessing when it comes to umpiring. Not the umpire\u2019s fault, but the way their procedures are written when it comes to DRS spikes. Rahul plays out the over. Here we go. The third innings of the match, starting after lunch on day two. A frustrating last hour or so for India, but still a strong position in the match, holding onto a lead despite being all out for 150. That lead is only 44 though, so the game is anyone\u2019s. India need to bat as well and as patiently as Australia\u2019s last-wicket pair did. Lunch time! See you in a bit. Finally, for India! The batting pair are expecting the extra half hour. They call the runner out with drinks. Harshit Rana comes on, pitches up, and finally Starc wants to have a go at somebody. Aims to drive over mid on, but mistimes it high towards point, and Pant has time to get under it with the gloves. A fine effort, batted for two hours this morning, and the partnership was an hour and a half. 51st over: Australia 103-9 (Starc 26, Hazlewood 6) The partnership heading up towards 17 overs. Lunch is due in a few minutes but can\u2019t the umpires take an extra half hour at nine down? Bumrah bumps Starc, bowls a fractional no-ball on the front foot too. Then pitches back up. Starc is covering the line. Last ball, an edge into the ground, then to the keeper. Bumrah tilts his head back and sighs. 50th over: Australia 102-9 (Starc 26, Hazlewood 6) Starc happy to face every Bumrah ball and leave Hazlewood to face Washington. The No11 essays one aggressive drive on the bounce to Kohli at short cover, but otherwise gets a big stride in, and gets well over the top of every ball. 49th over: Australia 102-9 (Starc 26, Hazlewood 6) Now Bumrah is back. Has to find another spell to try to finish this off. But the batters are well set, the ball is doing less, the pitch has eased. Still tough batting out there but not with that pep of the early morning. And even then, Bumrah gets one to seam and jump. Serious movement, and it goes past the edge. \u201cThat\u2019s going to beat Brian Lara, that one,\u201d says Allan Border. Great to hear him back for the trophy that bears his name. Sunil Gavaskar is here too. 48th over: Australia 102-9 (Starc 26, Hazlewood 6) Washington Sundar on! Spin. It doesn\u2019t seduce Starc into anything aggressive. Pats back five balls, scores one off the sixth. 47th over: Australia 101-9 (Starc 25, Hazlewood 6) The spinner is warming up furiously. It feels late to have left that option. Bumrah has bowled brilliantly but as captain has let things drift during this stand. Huge gaps on the leg side, Starc waits for the fourth ball, dinks it out there for his single. Too easy. Hazlewood blots the last two. 46th over: Australia 100-9 (Starc 24, Hazlewood 6) Another over, another late Starc single, another Hazlewood seeing-out. And guess what? The ton is up for Australia. The partnership more than 20. Reddy isn\u2019t threatening. \u201cStarc and Hazelwood may be experiencing charmed lives but their tenacity is very impressive. Every run materially and psychologically precious here.\u201d Brian Withington sent that 40 minutes ago. 45th over: Australia 99-9 (Starc 23, Hazlewood 6) Starc facing Siraj, the same pattern, just blocking away for a while, then aims one big pull shot but doesn\u2019t want the run. Can\u2019t understand this field back tactic, it lets him play shots like that with very little risk. Siraj finishes with a testing bouncer that follows Starc as he back away, past the grille. 44th over: Australia 98-9 (Starc 22, Hazlewood 6) Reddy aims at the stumps, and it\u2019s easy enough for Hazlewood to push a defensive drive past the bowler and belatedly call for a single. Too easy to get off strike first ball. Starc has only played a couple of big shots but they\u2019ve got four fielders out on the leg side. Nor does he play a big shot here, just waits for the last ball of the over and dashes a single to cover. Goes past Carey for top score of the innings. 43rd over: Australia 96-9 (Starc 21, Hazlewood 5) India still in the lead by 54, but they\u2019ll be grinding their teeth by now. Starc blocks out the whole over, Siraj bouncing him last ball so he doesn\u2019t have a chance to retain strike. Takes a blow on the back in that over, too, as he tries to evade one that doesn\u2019t get up. 42nd over: Australia 96-9 (Starc 21, Hazlewood 5) A bowling change, and Reddy will get his first bowl in Test cricket. Medium pacer, starts at 127 kilometres an hour. Bowls in the IPL. Hits his spot first ball, keeps finding a good length, nearly gets an edge from Starc cutting at width. Fields neatly off his own bowling, stops a straight drive. Clunks a pull shot, looking to go large but only skews it into a gap at midwicket for one. Hazlewood blocks the last though, and another over goes by. 41st over: Australia 95-9 (Starc 20, Hazlewood 5) Bumrah finally gives himself a breather, he\u2019ll be annoyed at how many times he should have had that wicket. Siraj comes on. And they\u2019re dropping the field back for Starc, that tactic that so often backfires. He still has three in the cordon, mind. But he\u2019s able to bat out a few balls then take an easy single. Surely Siraj is capable of getting Mitchell Starc out? And they have a gap at point for Hazlewood to drive into, he refuses the run, which might have been two runs had they gone immediately. 40th over: Australia 94-9 (Starc 19, Hazlewood 5) They finish the over, Starc taking a single, Hazlewood not taking one late in the over so Starc can keep strike. Sticking with Rana, no change in the first hour this morning. Starc ducks the first but doesn\u2019t duck the second, it hits his helmet. Rana comes up to check on him. Looks like a glancing one off the curved side of the helmet. They\u2019ll take the drinks break mid-over while Starc gets the mandatory concussion check\u2026 39th over: Australia 93-9 (Starc 18, Hazlewood 5) Another edge, glove in there, slower ball it looks like, so again no catch, it doesn\u2019t carry to slip. Starc scurries a single last ball of the over, pushed to mid on, another Bumrah over gone. Getting frustrating for India, even if the difference on the scoreboard isn\u2019t huge. 38th over: Australia 92-9 (Starc 17, Hazlewood 5) Time to slog! Starc realises Rana is his best hope to score, slaps a drive down the ground but there\u2019s a sweeper, so he stays put and bangs the next ball over midwicket for four. Glances a single to keep strike against Bumrah. Important runs. 37th over: Australia 87-9 (Starc 12, Hazlewood 5) Did Starc forget the plan? Maybe in the moment, instinct taking over as he plays a good pull shot and runs. They take the single, just making it too, and that leaves Hazlewood two balls to face against Bumrah. It\u2019s enough for the bowler, but not for his field, a spearing ball at middle stump that Hazlewood nicks, protecting his timber, and the edge flies between keeper and slip for four very lucky runs. 36th over: Australia 82-9 (Starc 11, Hazlewood 1) Rana carries on, still with pace. Up into the 140s. Oversteps though in his striving. Starc does let Hazlewood take his first run into the leg side \u2013 you can\u2019t decline too many in this position. But they swap the strike back with a leg bye, and Hazlewood survives the over, despite nearly nicking an attempted steer from the last ball. Three from the over, two of them extras, and Bumrah is back. 35th over: Australia 79-9 (Starc 11, Hazlewood 0) Bumrah looking to finish it off and take his sixth. Short to Starc, gets out of the way. Huge attempted drive misses, no nick though despite the appeal. Doesn\u2019t take a single, interestingly, when one is on from a glance. Starc reckons he has to be the one to survive Bumrah, and hope they can get through this spell to look for runs elsewhere. 34th over: Australia 79-9 (Starc 11, Hazlewood 0) Nearly gets Hazlewood nicking behind too, another rising ball outside off stump. The two left-handed quicks are all the Australians have left. There it is! Rana short and nasty, Lyon punches it, fist rather than bat, to gully for a looping catch, KL Rahul running in with his locks flowing. Lyon just couldn\u2019t evade that, the ball followed him. Good fast bowling. 33rd over: Australia 79-8 (Starc 11, Lyon 5) Bumrah to Starc, nasty bouncer first ball that\u2019s just over his front shoulder, Starc having to work to evade it. Then nearly getting a leading edge as Starc tries to clip across his pad to a ball angling away. Does make contact with the same shot next ball to midwicket. He\u2019s rotating strike decently but how long can it last? Bumrah cuts Lyon in half. Surely a wicket comes shortly. 32nd over: Australia 77-8 (Starc 10, Lyon 4) Play Bon Jovi. They\u2019re halfway there with Starc\u2019s single to mid on. Lyon gets them into the second half with a gentle pull from Rana for another single. 76 plays 150, as Starc edges on the bounce into the cordon. Then a pull shot that nearly carries to square leg! Single there, and Rana snorts a lifting ball past Lyon\u2019s edge. This is raw stuff. A bit more chatter between Starc and Rana, maybe getting pricklier. 31st over: Australia 74-8 (Starc 8, Lyon 3) Runs from Bumrah, Lyon manages to squirt it away for three. Starc says, no thanks, you have strike, and glances a single. Lyon defending awkwardly with an angled bat, but he\u2019s still kept Bumrah out for longer than several of his batting colleagues. Tries a big drive but find cover. Australia still short of halfway on India\u2019s score. 30th over: Australia 70-8 (Starc 7, Lyon 0) Rana the young bowler was picked to bowl fast, and he is at Starc, a few short balls including one that takes glove but lands safe. Starc is chipping him, though with a smile on his face. \u201cI bowl faster than you, and I\u2019ve got a long memory.\u201d Starc pats Rana on the shoulder at the end of the over, all seems friendly. 29th over: Australia 70-8 (Starc 7, Lyon 0) Nearly gets a nick from Lyon, too, does Bumrah. And again. Pushing at one ball, fanning at the next. Finally gets bat on a defensive push from the fifth. Hit on the body to end the over. Of course it\u2019s Bumrah! The Indian captain completes a five-wicket haul in the innings with his first ball of the second day. Around the wicket, back of a length, moving away off the seam with his brilliant wrist position. It\u2019s not good batting though, Carey doesn\u2019t need to play that, it\u2019s too short to threaten the stumps and too wide on line, but he\u2019s drawn into it, nervous about Bumrah, just wanting to block the ball out, and his defensive push nicks it through low to Pant. 28th over: Australia 70-7 (Carey 21, Starc 7) Harshit Rana to get us underway, with Australia trailing by 83 runs! Carey is happy to take an early single though, and Starc responds with one of his own. Carey again. Nudging and glancing, busy start. Here\u2019s my report on yesterday\u2019s play. Hello from Perth. The sun is shining strongly. It should be a bit warmer today, though still forecast to stay under 30 degrees. But the heat will be on in the middle. Alex Carey, in form and with a history of saving Australian innings, will need to do a special version of that, with only Mitch Starc, Nathan Lyon and Josh Hazlewood for company. If not, then India will take a surprising advantage after they were knocked over for 150 yesterday. It was a wild opening day, 17 wickets falling in a fast-bowling demonstration.",

      "bodyText": "Ministers are hiring a new EU negotiator as Keir Starmer seeks to reset Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe. The post, worth at least \u00a3153,000 a year and advertised by the Cabinet Office, would act as a representative for all of the UK\u2019s dealings with the bloc. The role is described as \u201cprincipal adviser to the prime minister and the minister for European Union relations [Nick Thomas-Symonds] on matters relating to relations with the EU and delivering the \u2018EU reset\u2019 and on international economic issues\u201d. The applicant would also represent the prime minister at negotiations. The trade and cooperation agreement, the basis for the UK-EU relationship after Brexit, will be subject to renewal talks in 2025. The representative would probably be responsible for overseeing these talks, and receive a salary of between \u00a3153,000 and \u00a3200,000. Starmer has vowed to turn the page on the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU. Since taking office he has visited the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in Berlin and met the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in Paris. He also hosted 50 leaders from across the continent for the European Political Community meeting at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. Speaking last month, Starmer admitted there would be challenges in resetting relations, but said he was \u201cturning the page on the old way of doing these negotiations\u201d in favour of a more \u201cconstructive\u201d approach. The Conservative party suggested that hiring a new EU negotiator showed the prime minister was attempting to \u201cundermine Brexit and our status as a sovereign nation with his plan to take the country back into the EU\u201d. The shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, said: \u201cThe Conservative party will not stand by and allow the will of the British people to be reversed while Labour arrogantly capitulates to the EU.\u201d A Labour source said: \u201cThis is truly desperate stuff from the Conservatives.

The oval alabasters and gleaming bronzes, punctured with holes and lozenge-like gaps, were all made in contrasting tones and surfaces, creating a new aesthetic.</p> <p>Now, Hepworth\u2019s unseen letters to the London foundry owner who made many of her bronze pieces offer a revelatory new guide to her work. The bundle of letters and draft sketches, which cover a decade of work and will be sold for the first time this week, also reveal the exacting standards of this pioneering woman, hailed as one of Britain\u2019s most important artists.</p> <p>Many of the instructions make it clear how deeply involved Hepworth was in the casting procedure, caring not just about the final look of the metal, but also the precise angle of balance. \u201cThese details will be fascinating to read, but also very useful to the people looking after her works,\u201d said Michael White, a professor of art history at the University of York, who worked with the Hepworth Wakefield museum on setting up the <a href=\"https://hepworthwakefield.org/our-story/hepworth-research-network/\">Hepworth Research Network</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already learned how attentive she was to the colours from her notes, something some Hepworth scholars may not know. She aimed at a wide range of shades and effects, with slight variations,\u201d said White. \u201cIt would be lovely if whoever buys these documents could make them available to academics and researchers.</p> <p>\u201cArt historians are sometimes too remote from the making process. The museum in Wakefield has a store of studio notes that read almost like recipes for creating the correct patination. The new letters will show how she used these in her instructions for specific work.\u201d</p> <p>Hepworth, born in 1903, was part of a groundbreaking British artistic moment. Her work gained status in the 1940s and 50s alongside that of the sculptor Henry Moore and painter Paul Nash. In 1949, she moved with her husband, the artist Ben Nicholson, and three children to Trewyn, a house and studio in St Ives, Cornwall. She died there in a fire in 1975 at the age of 72, and it is now run by Tate as a museum and sculpture garden.</p> <p>The annotated sketches and correspondence up for sale on 26 November at Chiswick Auctions, west London, are dated between 1960 and 1971 and were sent to Michael Gaskin, son of founder of the Art Bronze Foundry, Charles Gaskin, who died in 1969. There are 39 letters and five sketches from Hepworth which will be part of a sale of modern British and Irish art, going under the hammer with a guide price of \u00a315,000-25,000.</p>    <p>Hepworth\u2019s early pen and pencil designs for bronzes depict trademark works, each signed and covered with working notes to aid the bronze casting process at the traditional \u201clost-wax\u201d foundry \u2013 known informally as Gaskin\u2019s and established in 1922.</p> <p>The sculptor was quick to point out defects and damage, but was always polite when dealing with the artisans who helped her create her influential work. Writing to Michael Gaskin in March 1962, after an unsatisfactory result on a bronze, <em>Chun Quoit 2</em>, Hepworth writes: \u201cPlease do not say you have failed: On <em>Chun Quoit 2</em> the back to front stance was excellent but does not lean quite so much over the right. I enclose a photograph of the plaster which might help you adjust the near straight line on the right hand of the sculpture which is running slightly vertical. The join at the bottom was excellent and please do not think me unappreciative.\u201d</p> <p>In November 1971, the artist wrote to Gaskin with news that a bronze in Japan \u201cis in a very poor state as regards to patina\u201d. She adds, \u201cI had always thought Japan as a clean country, but all my bronzes were returned in a very black condition. Would it be possible for you to re-patinate this cast for me sometime soon \u2026?\u201d</p> <p>Hepworth liked the softness of alabaster, a property that allowed her to create a fluid line and then add a detailed finish. She experimented with other materials, though, working in slate as well as in bronze, and, as she wrote, \u201calways remaining constant to my conviction about truth to material\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe bronze casting process is complex right through to final finish,\u201d White said, explaining that Hepworth came to love it when she brought in both carving and casting. She took to producing plaster models at the same scale as the final bronze, which she could then carve. This went against the custom of making a small \u201cmaquette\u201d version that would then be enlarged.</p> <p>The archive is being sold by a collector who acquired it from Gaskin\u2019s foundry and the cache of letters \u2013 which also includes 31 from Hepworth\u2019s secretary and 24 carbon copy letters from the Art Bronze Foundry \u2013 has been catalogued with the help of a trustee of the Hepworth estate.</p> <p>\u201cConservators, in particular, will be looking at the descriptions of colour,\u201d said White. \u201cThey are often unsure whether they should take it back to the original, or whether an aged effect was something Hepworth wanted.\u201d</p>",

Many of the instructions make it clear how deeply involved Hepworth was in the casting procedure, caring not just about the final look of the metal, but also the precise angle of balance. \u201cThese details will be fascinating to read, but also very useful to the people looking after her works,\u201d said Michael White, a professor of art history at the University of York, who worked with the Hepworth Wakefield museum on setting up the Hepworth Research Network. \u201cWe\u2019ve already learned how attentive she was to the colours from her notes, something some Hepworth scholars may not know. She aimed at a wide range of shades and effects, with slight variations,\u201d said White. \u201cIt would be lovely if whoever buys these documents could make them available to academics and researchers. \u201cArt historians are sometimes too remote from the making process. The museum in Wakefield has a store of studio notes that read almost like recipes for creating the correct patination. The new letters will show how she used these in her instructions for specific work.\u201d Hepworth, born in 1903, was part of a groundbreaking British artistic moment. Her work gained status in the 1940s and 50s alongside that of the sculptor Henry Moore and painter Paul Nash. In 1949, she moved with her husband, the artist Ben Nicholson, and three children to Trewyn, a house and studio in St Ives, Cornwall. She died there in a fire in 1975 at the age of 72, and it is now run by Tate as a museum and sculpture garden. The annotated sketches and correspondence up for sale on 26 November at Chiswick Auctions, west London, are dated between 1960 and 1971 and were sent to Michael Gaskin, son of founder of the Art Bronze Foundry, Charles Gaskin, who died in 1969. There are 39 letters and five sketches from Hepworth which will be part of a sale of modern British and Irish art, going under the hammer with a guide price of \u00a315,000-25,000. Hepworth\u2019s early pen and pencil designs for bronzes depict trademark works, each signed and covered with working notes to aid the bronze casting process at the traditional \u201clost-wax\u201d foundry \u2013 known informally as Gaskin\u2019s and established in 1922. The sculptor was quick to point out defects and damage, but was always polite when dealing with the artisans who helped her create her influential work. Writing to Michael Gaskin in March 1962, after an unsatisfactory result on a bronze, Chun Quoit 2, Hepworth writes: \u201cPlease do not say you have failed: On Chun Quoit 2 the back to front stance was excellent but does not lean quite so much over the right. I enclose a photograph of the plaster which might help you adjust the near straight line on the right hand of the sculpture which is running slightly vertical. The join at the bottom was excellent and please do not think me unappreciative.\u201d In November 1971, the artist wrote to Gaskin with news that a bronze in Japan \u201cis in a very poor state as regards to patina\u201d. She adds, \u201cI had always thought Japan as a clean country, but all my bronzes were returned in a very black condition. Would it be possible for you to re-patinate this cast for me sometime soon \u2026?\u201d Hepworth liked the softness of alabaster, a property that allowed her to create a fluid line and then add a detailed finish. She experimented with other materials, though, working in slate as well as in bronze, and, as she wrote, \u201calways remaining constant to my conviction about truth to material\u201d. \u201cThe bronze casting process is complex right through to final finish,\u201d White said, explaining that Hepworth came to love it when she brought in both carving and casting. She took to producing plaster models at the same scale as the final bronze, which she could then carve. This went against the custom of making a small \u201cmaquette\u201d version that would then be enlarged. The archive is being sold by a collector who acquired it from Gaskin\u2019s foundry and the cache of letters \u2013 which also includes 31 from Hepworth\u2019s secretary and 24 carbon copy letters from the Art Bronze Foundry \u2013 has been catalogued with the help of a trustee of the Hepworth estate. \u201cConservators, in particular, will be looking at the descriptions of colour,\u201d said White. \u201cThey are often unsure whether they should take it back to the original, or whether an aged effect was something Hepworth wanted.\u201d",

Black Cube was able to obtain some of Farrow\u2019s geolocation data from his phone, thus tracking his movements, but the majority of its operations were contained to the analog world of traditional surveillance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jul/12/theres-a-lot-more-to-it-docuseries-goes-behind-the-2017-weinstein-expose\">\u2018There\u2019s a lot more to it\u2019: docuseries goes behind the 2017 Weinstein expos\u00e9</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Farrow later <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/harvey-weinsteins-army-of-spies\">reported</a> on these tactics for the New Yorker in the first of <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-espionage/the-black-cube-chronicles-the-private-investigators\">several</a> <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-espionage/the-black-cube-chronicles-the-undercover-operative\">pieces</a> <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-espionage/the-black-cube-chronicles-the-double-agent\">delving</a> into the shadowy world of surveillance and, in particular, the private companies selling insidiously powerful spyware technology. Surveillance has always been an exercise of intimidation \u2013 \u201cit is emotionally devastating and intrusive and it makes you feel unsafe,\u201d Farrow told the Guardian \u2013 but the new commercial spyware tools are, as laid out in a new documentary, \u201ca whole other game, a whole other level of sophistication\u201d.</p> <p>Surveilled, now on HBO, is, on one level, a visual accompaniment to Farrow\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/25/how-democracies-spy-on-their-citizens\">bombshell April 2022 report</a> on how governments \u2013 western democracies, autocratic regimes and many in between \u2013 secretly use commercial spyware to snoop on their citizens. The hour-long documentary, directed by Matthew O\u2019Neill and Perri Peltz, records the emotional toll, scope and threat potential of a technology most people are neither aware of nor understand. It also serves as an argument for urgent journalistic and civic oversight of commercial spyware \u2013 its deliberately obscure manufacturers, its abuse by state clients and its silent erosion of privacy.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8rh8reDqj8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/f8rh8reDqj8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The film, like Farrow\u2019s 2022 article and much of his subsequent reporting, primarily concerns a proprietary spyware technology called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/pegasus-project\">Pegasus</a> that is produced by the Israeli company NSO Group. Pegasus, as the film chillingly demonstrates, can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/video/2021/jul/19/pegasus-the-spyware-technology-that-threatens-democracy-video\">infiltrate a private device</a> through one of its many third-party apps, sometimes with one click \u2013 via a spam or phishing link \u2013 or, for certain models, without any help of the device\u2019s owner at all. Once activated, Pegasus can control your phone, turn on your microphone, use the camera, record voice or video, and disgorge any of its data \u2013 your texts, photos, location. It is very possible, and now documented, to be hacked by Pegasus and not even know it.</p> <p>Surveilled follows Farrow on his globe-trotting efforts to trace the invisible, international scope of Pegasus: to Tel Aviv, the center of the commercial spyware industry, where NSO executives toe the party line that the group only sells to governments for law enforcement purposes and has no knowledge of its abuses. To Silicon Valley, where the giant tech companies such as WhatsApp are in a game of cat and mouse with Pegasus and others infiltrating its services. To Canada, where the University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab leads efforts for transparency on who has Pegasus, and what they are doing with it. And to Barcelona, where Citizen Lab representatives detect Pegasus hacks, suspected from and later confirmed by the Spanish government, on pro-Catalan independence politicians, journalists and their families.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/18/what-is-pegasus-spyware-and-how-does-it-hack-phones\">What is Pegasus spyware and how does it hack phones?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Throughout the film, NSO claims to vet potential clients (though they have not disclosed what said vetting process entails), to have no knowledge of abuses \u2013 such as the Spanish government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/may/10/what-we-know-about-spains-cyber-espionage-spyware-scandals\">surveillance of Catalan separatists</a>, or the ruler of Dubai <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/06/walls-closing-in-story-behind-princess-haya-hacking-ordeal\">spying</a> on his ex-wife in London, or the Greek prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/07/greek-pm-kyriakos-mitsotakis-under-pressure-over-tapping-of-opponents-phone\">listening to rivals\u2019 calls</a> \u2013 and to discontinue business when such abuses arise. But Farrow\u2019s reporting suggests otherwise. \u201cThe data activists and watchdog groups that monitor this see the data as moving through the company\u2019s infrastructure in a way where it would be pretty hard to have no knowledge [of misuse],\u201d he said. This week, legal documents in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/29/pegasus-surveillance-code-whatsapp-meta-lawsuit-nso-group\">ongoing US litigation</a> between NSO and WhatsApp <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/14/nso-pegasus-spyware-whatsapp\">revealed</a> that it is the company, not its clients, that actually \u201cinstalls and extracts\u201d information from targeted mobile phones.</p> <p>Such targets are at the client\u2019s discretion, including regimes with abysmal human rights records that are instrumental to NSO\u2019s business. A former NSO salesperson who meets with Farrow anonymously in the film explains how NSO sold the same Pegasus technology to western European democracies for a fraction of the price it sold to repressive regimes in the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia \u2013 the logic being that western democracies are better representatives for the company. The same former NSO salesperson quit the company after investigations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/18/nso-spyware-used-to-target-family-of-jamal-khashoggi-leaked-data-shows-saudis-pegasus\">linked</a> Pegasus to the 2018 murder of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi officials. (The company has denied any involvement.)</p> <p>NSO\u2019s tentacles in surveillance beyond the scope of counter-terrorism, not to mention Israel\u2019s longstanding use of Palestine as a laboratory for surveillance, evinces the need for more transparency. \u201cThese companies need to be subject to the same kind of international regulation and legal infrastructure that arms dealers are,\u201d said Farrow. \u201cThat\u2019s just the reality. It\u2019s dangerous tech. It threatens democracy and freedom. It leads to violence. The data tells us this now. That doesn\u2019t mean that there are no law enforcement applications for it, which also makes it very similar to weapons of mass destruction.\u201d</p> <p>Also like weapons of mass destruction \u2013 and generative AI, another nascent technology whose implications far outpace regulations \u2013 \u201cwe can\u2019t be naive,\u201d Farrow added. \u201cYou can\u2019t put the genie back in the bottle. But we need restraints.\u201d</p> <p>The United States government has not yet, to public knowledge, used Pegasus on private citizens. The FBI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/02/fbi-confirms-it-obtained-nsos-pegasus-spyware\">bought</a> the technology under the Trump administration purportedly to test it, though a New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/12/us/politics/fbi-pegasus-spyware-phones-nso.html\">investigation</a> later found that the department was keen to operationalize it. In 2022, the Biden administration passed an executive order limiting the US government\u2019s ability to purchase private spyware that has been abused elsewhere \u2013 though, as with any legal measure, there are loopholes. \u201cIt is an encouraging statement of principle,\u201d said Farrow, as is the move to put NSO and other spyware companies on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/03/nso-group-pegasus-spyware-us-blacklist\">blacklist</a> that prevents them from doing business with US companies. \u201cBut these are pretty halting, limited measures.\u201d</p>    <p>And the incoming administration of Donald Trump appears to have little interest in even that.<strong> </strong>Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/11/trump-mike-waltz-national-security-adviser\">appointed</a> as his national security adviser Michael Waltz, who as a congressman advocated for the expansion of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in an effort to deport illegal immigrants. In a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-technology-the-trump-administration-could-use-to-hack-your-phone\">piece</a> for the New Yorker released the same day as the film, Farrow reported on the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s new $2m contract with an Israeli firm called Paragon for their Graphite spyware, which can breach encrypted messaging services such as Signal or Telegram. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), an agency within DHS, will almost certainly use the technology for Trump\u2019s stated plans to deport illegal immigrants en masse.</p> <p>Farrow characterized the purchase as an impending \u201cdigital panopticon\u201d for not just the 3.7 million people awaiting immigration hearings, nor the millions more who have so far evaded immigration enforcement, but the US population at large. \u201cThere\u2019s not transparency. There\u2019s not accountability,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it is very possible that with even thin types of law enforcement rationales, this could start to be deployed against people the administration just doesn\u2019t like, as we\u2019ve seen in a lot of these other democracies.</p> <p>\u201cAll of the privacy law experts that I\u2019m talking to are very, very afraid right now,\u201d he added. \u201cThis tech is just increasingly everywhere, and I think we have to contend with the inevitability that this is not just going to be this path of private companies selling to governments.\u201d</p> <p>Though in part a film of journalistic process, Surveilled also advocates for a regulatory framework on commercial spyware and surveillance, as well as awareness \u2013 even if you are not a journalist, a dissident, an activist, you could be surveilled, with privacy writ large at stake. The new digital surveillance tools are \u201cso cheap, and so accessible, and the legal protections are so porous\u201d, said Farrow. \u201cWe all need to be invested in whether the space for political diversity of opinion, resistance, dissent, journalists getting information, shrinks or remains alive.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not some side issue.

Black Cube was able to obtain some of Farrow\u2019s geolocation data from his phone, thus tracking his movements, but the majority of its operations were contained to the analog world of traditional surveillance. Farrow later reported on these tactics for the New Yorker in the first of several pieces delving into the shadowy world of surveillance and, in particular, the private companies selling insidiously powerful spyware technology. Surveillance has always been an exercise of intimidation \u2013 \u201cit is emotionally devastating and intrusive and it makes you feel unsafe,\u201d Farrow told the Guardian \u2013 but the new commercial spyware tools are, as laid out in a new documentary, \u201ca whole other game, a whole other level of sophistication\u201d. Surveilled, now on HBO, is, on one level, a visual accompaniment to Farrow\u2019s bombshell April 2022 report on how governments \u2013 western democracies, autocratic regimes and many in between \u2013 secretly use commercial spyware to snoop on their citizens. The hour-long documentary, directed by Matthew O\u2019Neill and Perri Peltz, records the emotional toll, scope and threat potential of a technology most people are neither aware of nor understand.

      "body": "<p><strong>The City and </strong><strong>Its Uncertain Walls</strong><strong> is based on a novella you wrote in </strong><strong>1980</strong><strong>. Why was it important </strong><strong>to give it a new audience now?</strong><br>That work is the only one I\u2019ve ever written that I never allowed to be reprinted in book form. To put it another way, I just wasn\u2019t satisfied with the story. I thought its theme was very important but unfortunately I lacked the writing skills at the time to convey it in the way I\u2019d hoped to. I decided to bide my time, until I\u2019d acquired the necessary skill set as a writer, and only then do a complete rewrite of the story.</p> <p>In the interim, though, I had lots of other work I wanted to undertake and just couldn\u2019t get started on this project. The next thing I knew, 40 years had passed (in a flash, it seemed), and I reached my 70s. I thought I\u2019d better get going if I wanted to really do this, since I might not have all that much time left. I also felt a strong need to fulfil my responsibilities as a novelist.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m grateful that so many people, a number I never anticipated, read my books \u2013 not everyone is as blessed as I am</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><br><strong>You wrote the book during lockdown, and rarely left your home when doing so. Did this way of writing affect the tone or content of the story?</strong><br>Certainly, when I was writing this novel I needed a certain amount of peace and quiet, and the time to contemplate things. The situation of the town surrounded by walls was also a metaphor of the worldwide lockdown. How is it possible for both extreme isolation and warm feelings of empathy to coexist? That was one of the major themes of this novel, and in that sense it\u2019s a significant leap forward compared with the original novella.</p> <p><strong>Some Japanese readers </strong><strong>were confused by the book. Others find the strangeness and surreal elements </strong><strong>some of the greatest pleasures of your novels. Do you like to leave readers with unanswered questions?</strong><br>I think an outstanding novel will always aim to present some compelling questions \u2013 but not give a clear-cut, straightforward conclusion. I\u2019d like to leave my readers, after they\u2019ve finished my books, with something to think about. Like, what endings would be possible here? I drop some hints inside each story in order to leave them thinking. What I\u2019d like is for readers to pick up on these and each arrive at their own, unique ending.</p>    <p>Countless readers have written telling me: \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed reading the same book of yours so many times.\u201d As the author, nothing could please me more.</p> <p><strong>When you write about a character like the narrator in The City \u2026, or </strong><strong>Toru in The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</strong><strong>, or </strong><strong>Kafka in Kafka on the Shore</strong><strong>, to what extent are you writing about yourself?</strong><br>The first-person protagonists of my novels are not, strictly speaking, the real me, but the me who might have been.

      "bodyText": "The City and Its Uncertain Walls is based on a novella you wrote in 1980. Why was it important to give it a new audience now? That work is the only one I\u2019ve ever written that I never allowed to be reprinted in book form. To put it another way, I just wasn\u2019t satisfied with the story. I thought its theme was very important but unfortunately I lacked the writing skills at the time to convey it in the way I\u2019d hoped to. I decided to bide my time, until I\u2019d acquired the necessary skill set as a writer, and only then do a complete rewrite of the story. In the interim, though, I had lots of other work I wanted to undertake and just couldn\u2019t get started on this project. The next thing I knew, 40 years had passed (in a flash, it seemed), and I reached my 70s. I thought I\u2019d better get going if I wanted to really do this, since I might not have all that much time left. I also felt a strong need to fulfil my responsibilities as a novelist. You wrote the book during lockdown, and rarely left your home when doing so. Did this way of writing affect the tone or content of the story? Certainly, when I was writing this novel I needed a certain amount of peace and quiet, and the time to contemplate things. The situation of the town surrounded by walls was also a metaphor of the worldwide lockdown. How is it possible for both extreme isolation and warm feelings of empathy to coexist? That was one of the major themes of this novel, and in that sense it\u2019s a significant leap forward compared with the original novella. Some Japanese readers were confused by the book. Others find the strangeness and surreal elements some of the greatest pleasures of your novels. Do you like to leave readers with unanswered questions? I think an outstanding novel will always aim to present some compelling questions \u2013 but not give a clear-cut, straightforward conclusion. I\u2019d like to leave my readers, after they\u2019ve finished my books, with something to think about. Like, what endings would be possible here? I drop some hints inside each story in order to leave them thinking. What I\u2019d like is for readers to pick up on these and each arrive at their own, unique ending. Countless readers have written telling me: \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed reading the same book of yours so many times.\u201d As the author, nothing could please me more. When you write about a character like the narrator in The City \u2026, or Toru in The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, or Kafka in Kafka on the Shore, to what extent are you writing about yourself? The first-person protagonists of my novels are not, strictly speaking, the real me, but the me who might have been. It\u2019s fascinating to pursue those possibilities, since there aren\u2019t many opportunities to become someone other than yourself. Among the many English-language writers you have translated into Japanese, including Salinger, Fitzgerald, Chandler, Carver and Capote, which of them mean most to you? I\u2019ve been influenced by each writer. I\u2019m very much drawn to Fitzgerald\u2019s and Capote\u2019s brilliant, luminous writing style, though it\u2019s totally different from my own. Personally, I\u2019m really fond of Chandler\u2019s style. How has the Japanese literary scene changed since you started writing and publishing more than 40 years ago, and do you feel part of that scene or outside it? I think younger writers nowadays have set aside any pretentious ideas about \u201cthis is what constitutes literature\u201d and write fiction with a more free, flexible approach. Which I really applaud. In my case, though, I just keep on working in my own way, and I can\u2019t say what relationship I might have with those changes in the literary scene. What changes have you seen in your readership, both within Japan and internationally, and does it get easier, or harder, to write as you go on? Both in Japan and abroad it seems the number of my readers around the world continues to go up, and I often find the numbers startling. In Laos I\u2019ve had a Thai reader stop me to say hello, in Dresden it was a reader from Albania, and in Tokyo it was an Indonesian reader. I often feel like I\u2019m not my real self, that instead I\u2019ve turned into some kind of fictitious person \u2026 None of that, though, has made writing novels either easier, or more difficult. I\u2019m simply grateful that so many people, a number I never anticipated, read my books. Not everyone is as blessed as I am. Japanese fiction now represents a quarter of all translated fiction sold in Britain. Why do you think it has such a wide appeal? I didn\u2019t know that Japanese novels are that popular in Britain. What\u2019s the reason? I have no idea. Maybe you could tell me \u2013 I\u2019d like to know. The Japanese economy is not doing well these days, and I think it\u2019s a good thing that cultural exports can make a contribution of sorts, though literary exports don\u2019t make that much of one, do they? Did Mieko Kawakami\u2019s criticism of the women in your books, made in 2017, have any effect on how you write female characters? My books have been criticised so much over the years that I can\u2019t remember in what context the criticisms were made. And I don\u2019t pay much attention to it, either. Mieko is a close friend and a very intelligent woman, so I\u2019m sure whatever criticism she made was spot on. But honestly, I don\u2019t recall what exactly she criticised.

      "body": "<p>Anyone who has been&nbsp;in a bookshop in the last few years will have noticed that Japanese fiction is experiencing an extraordinary boom. In 2022, figures from Nielsen BookScan showed that Japanese fiction represented 25% of all translated fiction sales in the UK. The dominance is even more striking this year: figures obtained by the Guardian show that, of the top 40 translated fiction titles for 2024 so far, 43% are Japanese, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/mar/10/butter-by-asako-yuzuki-review-novel-konkatsu-killer-kanae-kijima\">Asako Yuzuki\u2019s satirical, socially conscious crime novel Butter</a> topping the list. Butter also won the breakthrough author award at this year\u2019s Books Are My Bag readers awards, which are curated by booksellers and voted for by the public.</p> <p>The popularity of modern Japanese fiction is not a new phenomenon in the UK, of course. In the 1990s, two writers broke through and became cult hits in this country. Haruki Murakami, a worldwide literary phenomenon, took off in Britain when Harvill Press published The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle in 1998. Scott Pack, who ran Waterstones\u2019 buying team in the early 2000s, is a big Murakami fan and remembers giving him \u201clots of attention. Whatever books of his came out, we got massively behind.\u201d This week, Murakami publishes his 15th novel The City and Its Uncertain Walls, about a man who travels to a mysterious walled town in pursuit of the woman he loves, finding himself in a strange world of libraries, maps and dreams. So what\u2019s behind the lasting success of Murakami\u2019s books, which tend to combine lonely protagonists, jazz, cats, and fantasy elements? \u201cIt\u2019s fairly accessible, weird shit,\u201d Pack says.</p>    <p>But, he adds, Banana Yoshimoto got there first. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to point out that she predates Murakami.\u201d Yoshimoto came into English translation in the late 1980s and early 90s with books including Kitchen and Lizard, her work often featuring alienated young women trying to overcome personal tragedy.</p> <p>Murakami and Yoshimoto have something else in common: both were criticised in a 1990 essay by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/24/kenzaburo-oe-obituary\">Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce</a>, the Japanese Nobel prize-winning author. Their works, he said, \u201cconvey the experience of a youth politically uninvolved or disaffected, content to exist with an adolescent or post-adolescent subculture\u201d. Many elements that unite Murakami and Yoshimoto\u2019s fiction \u2013 alienation, surrealism, resisting social expectations \u2013 are present in today\u2019s bestselling Japanese titles. But it is only in the past decade that a wider range of Japanese authors has taken off here. There has been a huge growth in Japanese crime fiction, both classic and contemporary: joining Yuzuki\u2019s Butter in this year\u2019s top 20 translated fiction titles is Seich\u014d Matsumoto\u2019s golden age crime novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jun/24/the-best-recent-crime-and-thrillers-review-roundup\">Tokyo Express</a>. There has also been a surge in literary fiction, often from female perspectives, by writers including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/09/sayaka-murata-i-acted-how-i-thought-a-cute-woman-should-act-it-was-horrible\">Sayaka Murata</a>, Hiromi Kawakami and Mieko Kawakami.</p>    <p>Publishing Murata\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/07/convenience-store-woman-sayaka-murata-review\">Convenience Store Woman</a> in 2018 was a \u201ca watershed moment\u201d, says Jason Arthur, associate publishing director at Granta. The novel, which follows Keiko, a 36-year-old woman who struggles to fit in but finds contentment in routine work at a small shop, was the first of three Murata titles published by Granta \u2013 the others are Earthlings and Life Ceremony \u2013 that have now sold more than half a million copies. \u201cShe is a phenomenon,\u201d says Arthur. \u201cThe role of Convenience Store Woman in the Japanese literature boom really can\u2019t be overstated,\u201d agrees Alison Fincher, who runs the <a href=\"https://readjapaneseliterature.com/\">Read Japanese Literature</a> website and podcast.</p> <p>The success of Murata\u2019s books is \u201creally astonishing\u201d, says Ginny Tapley Takemori, Murata\u2019s English translator, who has lived in Tokyo for 20 years. People tend to see Convenience Store Woman as a book about autism, she says, \u201cwhich was not what Sayaka necessarily intended, but she doesn\u2019t mind people seeing it that way. She shows us that what we take for granted as normal is not actually normal at all.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Publishers went from asking, \u2018Can you give us another Murakami?\u2019 to \u2018Can you give us another Murata?\u2019</p> <footer> <cite>Alison Fincher</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Takemori has been instrumental in the drive to have more work by female writers translated, setting up the group Strong Women, Soft Power with fellow translators Lucy North and Allison Markin Powell.

Lawson grew up in Japan, and when she was a junior editor, \u201cI was the only person looking for Japanese fiction,\u201d she says. \u201cI saw a copy of The Guest Cat,\u201d Lawson recalls, referring to Takashi Hiraide\u2019s 2001 novel, which went on to become a bestseller, and she thought, \u201cI want to publish a book like that.\u201d In 2017, she published the English translation of The Travelling Cat Chronicles by Hiro Arikawa, which has \u201cgone on and on\u201d, selling more than a million copies. </p> <p>What is interesting about the comfort genre, says Lawson, is that it crosses divides, appealing to young and old alike. These books \u201chave qualities that have always been around \u2013 like [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/may/24/paulocoelho\">Paulo Coelho\u2019s] The Alchemist</a> \u2013 but it\u2019s been elevated and given a more cool element because of Instagram and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/25/the-rise-of-booktok-meet-the-teen-influencers-pushing-books-up-the-charts\">BookTok</a>.\u201d</p>    <p>There is, Lawson acknowledges, a sniffiness about comfort books, and the cat subgenre in particular: \u201cI don\u2019t mind, because they\u2019re selling so many copies. We don\u2019t mind if people are a little bit envious or supercilious.\u201d In fact this attitude is probably less to do with individual titles than with the sense of a bandwagon being pursued at high speed by so many publishing houses. </p> <p>Publishers have been known to adapt books to appeal to established trends in Japanese fiction. Literary agent Li Kangqin, who specialises in east Asian literature, gives the example of one of her own agency\u2019s titles, a nonfiction narrative about a female bookseller. \u201cIt has an entirely different name in Japanese, but the UK publisher changed the name to The Bookshop Woman in order to make it sound slightly similar to Convenience Store Woman.\u201d (The book is, Kangqin acknowledges, \u201cselling really well\u201d.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The cat motif on a cover is now so powerful that the presence of cats within the novel\u00a0 is superfluous\u00a0</p> <footer> <cite>Ginny Tapley Takemori</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The cat motif on a cover is now so powerful that, as book blogger and Japanese fiction enthusiast Tony Malone points out, the presence of cats within the novel itself is superfluous. He recently read Satoshi Yagisawa\u2019s Days at the Morasaki Bookshop, the fifth bestselling translated fiction title of 2024. \u201cThere\u2019s a cat on the cover. There is no cat in the book. Not a mention.\u201d (The sequel, he observes, has two cats on the cover.)</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like cat books are huge in Japan,\u201d says Takemori. \u201cThey exist, but it\u2019s not as big a thing as is being made out in the UK.\u201d She adds that Japanese fiction generally can be \u201cunashamedly sentimental\u201d, and she has translated a number of cat books, including Shinkai\u2019s She and Her Cat. \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of sentimentality,\u201d Takemori continues, \u201cbut I do really like that little book. I had to work quite hard to avoid making it overly sentimental in English.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, as Fincher points out, there are readers&nbsp;for whom \u201ccomfort novels are a kind of gateway into the&nbsp;broader world of Japanese fiction\u201d. Their success means other, more complex, Japanese fiction is being translated that may not otherwise have seen the light&nbsp;of&nbsp;day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/mar/10/butter-by-asako-yuzuki-review-novel-konkatsu-killer-kanae-kijima\">Butter by Asako Yuzuki review \u2013 a tasty expos\u00e9 of fatphobia and trauma</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fact remains, however, that the genres of Japanese fiction that are popular in the UK \u2013 crime, young women\u2019s literary fiction, comfort books \u2013 are \u201cheavily curated\u201d, as Fincher puts it, to the detriment of other genres that are popular in Japan. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing very much hard sci-fi, supernatural or horror. We don\u2019t see very much romance outside of light novels and manga. Japan has a very strong tradition of historical fiction, especially the samurai novels. We don\u2019t see those.\u201d Li Kangqin agrees. \u201cThere are books selling hugely in Japan that don\u2019t travel well. Short story collections don\u2019t sell.\u201d</p> <p>Aside from the dominance of a few genres, is there something else about the themes or style of Japanese literature that appeals to readers here? Fincher points out that a novel she read in 2018, Hybrid Child by Mariko \u014chara, about a cross-gendered robot and AI, was published in Japan in 1990. \u201cAnd I realised that Japanese literature started coping with these late-stage capitalist issues, and these gender and feminist issues, in ways that English language literature didn\u2019t start dealing with for two decades.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/29/its-exciting-its-powerful-how-translated-fiction-captured-a-new-generation-of-readers\">\u2018It\u2019s exciting, it\u2019s powerful\u2019: how translated fiction captured a new generation of readers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Kangqin, a factor is that, in modern Japanese literature, \u201cwriters are almost always coming from urban settings. And I think this urban landscape is both familiar for the audience here, and a little bit fascinating, because it\u2019s in the east.\u201d As Malone puts it, \u201cwhat people want is an \u2018otherness\u2019 that\u2019s not <em>too</em> other. A comfortable other.\u201d For Takemori, \u201cJapanese [literature] is much less judgmental than western literature. Western literature tends to be focused on whether things are good or evil. Whereas in Japan, the border between good and evil is much more blurred: evil characters often have something good about them; good characters are often flawed. The endings of novels are much more open.\u201d</p> <p>But in an industry driven by trends, is Japanese fiction in danger of losing its appeal? Has it already peaked? \u201cThere are always waves in publishing,\u201d says Kangqin. \u201cIt will pass one day. I\u2019m totally fine with cat books passing like sand.\u201d But other Japanese books, she says, will stay. She predicts that Emi Yagi\u2019s Diary of a Void, about a young woman who rebels against society by pretending to be pregnant, \u201cwill enter literary studies\u201d. Granta\u2019s Jason Arthur believes we are \u201cat the crest of a huge wave\u201d. Granta, he says, will \u201calways be publishing Japanese fiction, but I think after a few corporate publishers put a lot behind some books that don\u2019t work, they will lose interest.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, what sells fiction, whether from Japan or other countries, whether cat books or crime, is its universality across genre and language. As Fincher observes of Murata\u2019s work, it tells us that \u201cwe\u2019re all a little bit weird, and human society is weird, and this is all of us in this story\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 November 2024.

We don\u2019t see those.\u201d Li Kangqin agrees. \u201cThere are books selling hugely in Japan that don\u2019t travel well. Short story collections don\u2019t sell.\u201d Aside from the dominance of a few genres, is there something else about the themes or style of Japanese literature that appeals to readers here? Fincher points out that a novel she read in 2018, Hybrid Child by Mariko \u014chara, about a cross-gendered robot and AI, was published in Japan in 1990. \u201cAnd I realised that Japanese literature started coping with these late-stage capitalist issues, and these gender and feminist issues, in ways that English language literature didn\u2019t start dealing with for two decades.\u201d For Kangqin, a factor is that, in modern Japanese literature, \u201cwriters are almost always coming from urban settings. And I think this urban landscape is both familiar for the audience here, and a little bit fascinating, because it\u2019s in the east.\u201d As Malone puts it, \u201cwhat people want is an \u2018otherness\u2019 that\u2019s not too other. A comfortable other.\u201d For Takemori, \u201cJapanese [literature] is much less judgmental than western literature. Western literature tends to be focused on whether things are good or evil. Whereas in Japan, the border between good and evil is much more blurred: evil characters often have something good about them; good characters are often flawed. The endings of novels are much more open.\u201d But in an industry driven by trends, is Japanese fiction in danger of losing its appeal? Has it already peaked? \u201cThere are always waves in publishing,\u201d says Kangqin. \u201cIt will pass one day. I\u2019m totally fine with cat books passing like sand.\u201d But other Japanese books, she says, will stay. She predicts that Emi Yagi\u2019s Diary of a Void, about a young woman who rebels against society by pretending to be pregnant, \u201cwill enter literary studies\u201d. Granta\u2019s Jason Arthur believes we are \u201cat the crest of a huge wave\u201d. Granta, he says, will \u201calways be publishing Japanese fiction, but I think after a few corporate publishers put a lot behind some books that don\u2019t work, they will lose interest.\u201d Ultimately, what sells fiction, whether from Japan or other countries, whether cat books or crime, is its universality across genre and language. As Fincher observes of Murata\u2019s work, it tells us that \u201cwe\u2019re all a little bit weird, and human society is weird, and this is all of us in this story\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 November 2024. An earlier version misspelt Li Kangqin\u2019s name.",

The A66 Trans-Pennine route was closed between the A6 and the M6 (J40). An amber alert for heavy snow and ice is in force until 5pm on Saturday in areas across Scotland, where 10-20cm is likely on ground above 200 metres and potentially as much as 20-40cm on hills above 400 metres. The weather warning covers parts of Angus, Perth and Kinross, Stirlingshire, Aberdeenshire and some of the Highlands, Argyll and Bute, the Borders, Dumfries and Galloway, East Ayrshire and South Lanarkshire. The annual Perth Christmas lights switch-on event has been cancelled over safety and travel concerns. A second amber warning is in place until midday on Saturday covering parts of Yorkshire and north east England. While yellow warnings for wind, rain and snow are in place until 9am on Sunday for broader areas of those regions. The Met Office meteorologist Aidan McGivern said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see two to four hours of heavy snow across parts of northern England and Scotland during Saturday morning. \u201cThis snow will accumulate thick and fast, with five to 10cm at lower levels and as much as 20 to 40cm over hills accompanied by strong winds. \u201cYou can expect blizzards over hills across northern England and Scotland, atrocious conditions for travelling and going over the hills and also the risk of power interruptions because of snow build-up on power lines. \u201cSo all in all, a multiple hazard event as we go into Saturday morning.\u201d He said temperatures would rise quickly as the storm brought with it milder air from the Atlantic, resulting in a \u201crapid thaw\u201d by the afternoon. \u201cThe melting snow and the heavy rain could lead to localised flooding in places but the wettest spots would be Wales, in the south-west, particularly over south-facing hills, that\u2019s where we\u2019re likely to see gales and certainly the risk of impacts from wind as well as from rain,\u201d the meteorologist said. Over the weekend, Wales and south-west England may receive 75mm of rain widely, and potentially more than 100mm over the higher parts of south Wales and Dartmoor. Strong winds were expected to strike the southern coast, with gusts of more than 70mph in places. Wind warnings covered Scotland from 5am until 7pm on Saturday. Rain and snow warnings covered northern England until 9am on Sunday and Northern Ireland until 11am on Saturday. Rain warnings covered much of Wales until 6am on Sunday, and south-west England until 11.45pm on Saturday. A wind warning also covered coastal areas of southern England from 9am until 9pm on Sunday. ScotRail had cancelled services from Inverness to Elgin, Aberdeen to Inverurie, and Glasgow Queen Street to Oban, while trains from Glasgow Central to Carlisle were terminating at Dumfries. South Western Rail asked passengers to only travel west of Basingstoke if their journeys were essential. It said services between Exeter and London Waterloo would start and finish at Basingstoke; that journey times would be longer between Salisbury and Exeter and between Bournemouth and Weymouth due to speed restrictions; and that services across its network would start later than usual on Sunday and Monday because of safety inspections. The TransPennine Express \u201cstrongly\u201d urged customers not to travel north of Carlisle on Saturday, while Avanti West Coast advised passengers not to travel north of Preston \u2013 including to Lancaster, Oxenholme, Penrith, Carlisle, Glasgow and Edinburgh.",

But he decided against defending it for a fifth time in 2023, citing a lack of motivation to go through the months-long slog of preparation that world championship matches demand.

Ding holds a 2\u00bd-\u00bd edge in their head-to-head with two wins and one draw, all since January 2023.

This is in so many ways the perfect Test series: the 21st-century power versus the classical aesthetic of greens and whites, slab-chested slip cordon, the great abrasive Australian outdoors.</p> <p>Even the buildup to that thrillingly fast-forward <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2024/nov/22/festival-of-fast-bowling-leaves-india-on-top-after-australia-collapse\">first day in Perth</a> was textbook. Reflexively, like an old dog kicking its legs out in its sleep, 54-year-old Glenn McGrath has spent the week \u201ctargeting\u201d Virat Kohli in the media, talking about pressure and going hard and calling Kohli \u201cemotional\u201d, which in this context is clearly the very worst thing he could be, McGrath basically saying he drinks elderflower cordial and is afraid of wasps.</p> <p>From an Anglo perspective the optics are perfect, kicking off at that point in the English winter when it\u2019s suddenly so cold just stepping out of the front door makes you want to vomit into your sleeve, when the colours of the southern summer are strangely hypnotic, bounced around the world into your late-night screen, those lovely bleached-out greens and yellows, the hard white sun, Pat Cummins in creamy whites looking like the impossibly handsome captain of the intergalactic fleet.</p> <p>At which point, as these deep Test cricket orthodoxies start to settle in around you, enter the IPL and a reminder that the sun does not in fact revolve around this dying planet.

Because we can, and literally will, buy every single one of you.</p>    <p>In the middle of all this, it is worth having some sympathy for Jofra, a man lodged right at the heart of these conflicting tides, a year to the day from the start of the next Ashes series and feeling the pull of England; but like everyone else blinded also by the career-defining light of the Mega Auction.</p> <p>Archer deserves a little sympathy here. Initially he withdrew from next year\u2019s IPL. The England and Wales Cricket Board is keen to manage his workload. The plan, the vision, Rob Key\u2019s impossible fever dream as he lies awake at night in his chino-pyjamas, is to get an overseas Ashes series out of Archer next winter.</p> <p>It is, to be fair, a delicious prospect in theory. Archer-Wood-Atkinson-Carse is a deeply sexy bowling lineup. With this in mind there has, for the first time, been a slight hint of ambient frustration at the latest turn in an endlessly muddled career. England have been paying Archer something like \u00a3800,000 a year with the idea of retaining control, of preserving his precious physicality, saving him up for a defining moment.</p> <p>Going to the IPL in April will mean he is out of that cycle, that he won\u2019t be able to play early season red-ball cricket, with the faintly absurd idea that the best possible course for this butterfly on a wheel is bowling with a spongy ball in the spring to prepare himself for something he basically can\u2019t do anyway in the winter.</p> <p>There are two things worth saying about this. First, the idea of Jofra actually playing a significant role in the Ashes is an act of willed nostalgia.</p> <p>He still has wonderful skill and startlingly easy speed. But he can barely get through back-to-back T20s. His last red-ball game was three and a half years ago. Talking about Jofra and Test cricket is like talking about the Stone Roses releasing another album. It\u2019s wilful escapism, chasing the past, building a bar in your&nbsp;suburban garage and trying to get the old gang back together.</p> <p>It is worth remembering, as this process reaches a way point, that England injured Jofra properly in the first place, with the unfortunate events of 2019 and the following year. We remember the slightly grisly eight-over fitness Test (\u201cshow us some fire\u201d) with an undetected stress fracture in his arm.</p> <p>Secondly, and more to the point, Archer is obviously right to look first at what is actually there in front of him. The IPL is pulling hard at those old bonds right now. Life is short. Pain is real. The money is too good. Even if Archer does go to India in April there\u2019s enough late season red-ball stuff to prepare him for Perth and November 2025.</p> <p>Does it matter if he just basically turns up and does that? Trust the shapes, the action, the fact he essentially bowls the same beautifully simple ball (wrist, bounce, line, seam), that he is in effect a portable set of high-end skills.</p> <p>England bowling plans generally fail in any case. Wood and Archer in 50-degree heat on a flat one trying to fight off the physical reality, the bowl-or-die career killer, is a chaotically brilliant idea.</p> <p>But it is, like everything else, hostage both to common sense and the structural forces of what is, it seems, the real world. Here is the most Mega thing about the Mega Auction. The 10 IPL teams will disburse \u00a3120m a year in basic salaries across those two days. By the end of the season they will also have dished out more in additional match fee payments (\u00a313m) than the Hundred\u2019s entire \u00a39m salary budget.</p> <p>Test cricket has survived this long by telling you it matters, by projecting gravity, drama, status, ritual. Money, on the other hand, will just walk through the middle of whatever you\u2019re doing and drag you in its wake. Jofra didn\u2019t make this world. Let him do what he wants. Let\u2019s face it \u2013 control went out of the window some time back.</p>",

It\u2019s wilful escapism, chasing the past, building a bar in your suburban garage and trying to get the old gang back together. It is worth remembering, as this process reaches a way point, that England injured Jofra properly in the first place, with the unfortunate events of 2019 and the following year. We remember the slightly grisly eight-over fitness Test (\u201cshow us some fire\u201d) with an undetected stress fracture in his arm. Secondly, and more to the point, Archer is obviously right to look first at what is actually there in front of him. The IPL is pulling hard at those old bonds right now. Life is short. Pain is real. The money is too good. Even if Archer does go to India in April there\u2019s enough late season red-ball stuff to prepare him for Perth and November 2025. Does it matter if he just basically turns up and does that? Trust the shapes, the action, the fact he essentially bowls the same beautifully simple ball (wrist, bounce, line, seam), that he is in effect a portable set of high-end skills. England bowling plans generally fail in any case. Wood and Archer in 50-degree heat on a flat one trying to fight off the physical reality, the bowl-or-die career killer, is a chaotically brilliant idea. But it is, like everything else, hostage both to common sense and the structural forces of what is, it seems, the real world. Here is the most Mega thing about the Mega Auction. The 10 IPL teams will disburse \u00a3120m a year in basic salaries across those two days. By the end of the season they will also have dished out more in additional match fee payments (\u00a313m) than the Hundred\u2019s entire \u00a39m salary budget. Test cricket has survived this long by telling you it matters, by projecting gravity, drama, status, ritual. Money, on the other hand, will just walk through the middle of whatever you\u2019re doing and drag you in its wake. Jofra didn\u2019t make this world. Let him do what he wants. Let\u2019s face it \u2013 control went out of the window some time back.",

Erling Haaland urges his teammates to keep going. An unseen staff member asks whether anyone is still in the toilets. It feels somehow fitting that this question does not come from Guardiola.

Perhaps this part gets overlooked a little when you are also one of the great tactical minds of your generation. But what Guardiola instinctively gets \u2013 and why his words so rarely transcribe into great written copy \u2013 is that football oratory is essentially a kind of short-form theatre, a full-body performance, a vessel into which the entire soul must be poured.</p> \n<p>Guardiola puts on an affected camp voice. \u201cEh, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go,\u201d he says, clapping weakly, mocking his team\u2019s lack of intensity at the start of the game. Suddenly a hand comes crashing down on to the table of energy drinks. \u201cMy words don\u2019t work if you don\u2019t believe it inside!\u201d he thunders, arms whirling like swords. \u201cNow is the moment you have to prove how incredible you are! You cannot go home regretting! We CANNOT GO&nbsp;HOME!\u201d</p> \n<p>The latest Manchester City documentary \u2013 the inauspiciously titled 4-In-A-Row \u2013 was released this week, and as with its predecessors a common theme emerges. For most of the production, as City maintain their graceful ascent towards a fourth consecutive Premier League title, Guardiola is a restrained, thoughtful presence, drawling little nuggets of wisdom in that characteristic low voice of his, like a&nbsp;repentant ex-smoker.</p> \n<p>But in the tougher moments, something primal seems to stir. Adversity brings an animal charisma out of him. The eyes burn wild, the background noise stills to a deathly hush. \u201cIn the fucking 18-yard box, you don\u2019t touch the opponent!\u201d he raves after a late penalty earns Crystal Palace a 2-2 draw at the Etihad Stadium. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable, Phil Foden,&nbsp;unacceptable!\u201d</p> \n<p>And so, on reflection, perhaps we should not be so surprised that Guardiola has chosen this juncture to announce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/21/signed-and-sealed-pep-guardiola-pens-new-two-year-manchester-city-deal\">the renewal of his City contract for another two years</a>. Four defeats in a row, Liverpool romping clear at the top of the table, a legal battle with the Premier League that threatens to bring an entire golden era crashing down. What better time for a dramatic and unequivocal show of strength? Punch Guardiola in the face right now and he would probably sign on for a third year.</p> \n<p>As for the decision itself \u2013 stay or go \u2013 this was probably a more prosaic call. There is always a temptation to interpret everything Guardiola does as a kind of 4D mind game, but this is one of those situations where the simplest explanation is probably the most appropriate. This is a man who just quite likes his job. He gets to work with brilliant footballers. He gets plenty of money to spend. Manchester is a great city. The club&nbsp;is pretty much built around his&nbsp;needs. He knows everyone there. He is 53 and seemingly in decent health. This doesn\u2019t have to be hard.</p> \n<p>Besides, it\u2019s worth considering the other side of the deal: where exactly might Guardiola go that would not, on some level, feel like a step backwards? There are only a handful of clubs in the world that could afford his salary, only a handful of clubs that could compete for the sort of trophies that would interest him and an even smaller handful of clubs that could do both. Given his emotional ties, we can safely rule out Real Madrid, Liverpool and Manchester United. Barcelona and Bayern Munich he has done. Who\u2019s left? Given the absence of alternatives, perhaps it is no wonder the Football Association fleetingly believed it was in with a chance.</p> \n<p>In the short term at least, the upshot will probably be negligible. There has been some talk of Guardiola\u2019s decision potentially focusing minds, but in truth his departure would probably have had the same effect. City are still fighting on four fronts \u2013 the league, the FA Cup, the Champions League and the courts \u2013 and will expect to triumph in all of them. Very little has changed in that regard.</p> \n<p>But when it comes to Guardiola himself, something important <em>has</em> changed here. The new contract takes him to 2027, at which point he will be 56 with two decades of management under his belt.

      "bodyText": "\u201cCome here guys, come here,\u201d shouts Pep Guardiola as the Manchester City players gather in the dressing room of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. It\u2019s 0-0 at half-time, the Premier League title is slipping away and the energy levels are frail, bordering dead. Kevin De Bruyne dabs sweat from his brow. Erling Haaland urges his teammates to keep going. An unseen staff member asks whether anyone is still in the toilets. It feels somehow fitting that this question does not come from Guardiola. Great orators should not have to corral their audience out of the can in advance. And Guardiola really is a great orator: at least the equal of J\u00fcrgen Klopp or Jos\u00e9 Mourinho or John Sitton or any of the other great managerial talkers. Perhaps this part gets overlooked a little when you are also one of the great tactical minds of your generation. But what Guardiola instinctively gets \u2013 and why his words so rarely transcribe into great written copy \u2013 is that football oratory is essentially a kind of short-form theatre, a full-body performance, a vessel into which the entire soul must be poured. Guardiola puts on an affected camp voice. \u201cEh, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go,\u201d he says, clapping weakly, mocking his team\u2019s lack of intensity at the start of the game. Suddenly a hand comes crashing down on to the table of energy drinks. \u201cMy words don\u2019t work if you don\u2019t believe it inside!\u201d he thunders, arms whirling like swords. \u201cNow is the moment you have to prove how incredible you are! You cannot go home regretting! We CANNOT GO HOME!\u201d The latest Manchester City documentary \u2013 the inauspiciously titled 4-In-A-Row \u2013 was released this week, and as with its predecessors a common theme emerges. For most of the production, as City maintain their graceful ascent towards a fourth consecutive Premier League title, Guardiola is a restrained, thoughtful presence, drawling little nuggets of wisdom in that characteristic low voice of his, like a repentant ex-smoker. But in the tougher moments, something primal seems to stir. Adversity brings an animal charisma out of him. The eyes burn wild, the background noise stills to a deathly hush. \u201cIn the fucking 18-yard box, you don\u2019t touch the opponent!\u201d he raves after a late penalty earns Crystal Palace a 2-2 draw at the Etihad Stadium. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable, Phil Foden, unacceptable!\u201d And so, on reflection, perhaps we should not be so surprised that Guardiola has chosen this juncture to announce the renewal of his City contract for another two years. Four defeats in a row, Liverpool romping clear at the top of the table, a legal battle with the Premier League that threatens to bring an entire golden era crashing down. What better time for a dramatic and unequivocal show of strength? Punch Guardiola in the face right now and he would probably sign on for a third year. As for the decision itself \u2013 stay or go \u2013 this was probably a more prosaic call. There is always a temptation to interpret everything Guardiola does as a kind of 4D mind game, but this is one of those situations where the simplest explanation is probably the most appropriate. This is a man who just quite likes his job. He gets to work with brilliant footballers. He gets plenty of money to spend. Manchester is a great city. The club is pretty much built around his needs. He knows everyone there. He is 53 and seemingly in decent health. This doesn\u2019t have to be hard. Besides, it\u2019s worth considering the other side of the deal: where exactly might Guardiola go that would not, on some level, feel like a step backwards? There are only a handful of clubs in the world that could afford his salary, only a handful of clubs that could compete for the sort of trophies that would interest him and an even smaller handful of clubs that could do both. Given his emotional ties, we can safely rule out Real Madrid, Liverpool and Manchester United. Barcelona and Bayern Munich he has done. Who\u2019s left? Given the absence of alternatives, perhaps it is no wonder the Football Association fleetingly believed it was in with a chance. In the short term at least, the upshot will probably be negligible. There has been some talk of Guardiola\u2019s decision potentially focusing minds, but in truth his departure would probably have had the same effect. City are still fighting on four fronts \u2013 the league, the FA Cup, the Champions League and the courts \u2013 and will expect to triumph in all of them. Very little has changed in that regard. But when it comes to Guardiola himself, something important has changed here. The new contract takes him to 2027, at which point he will be 56 with two decades of management under his belt. By which point even the greatest coaches are no longer really innovating but simply plugging away, no longer building their legacy but simply maintaining it, protecting it against the twin devils of time and obsolescence. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and Bill Shankly were 46 when they took on the last coaching job of their careers. Alex Ferguson was 44. May Guardiola have taken his last job at the age of 45? Doubtless when he finally leaves City there will be no shortage of fresh projects to tempt him. But this \u2013 right here \u2013 was probably his last opportunity to craft something genuinely new. So what remains for him at City? Everything that can be won has been won. All the available feelings have been felt. It\u2019s a pure numbers game now: one more lap of honour, one more cigar on the open-top bus, one more title, and then another, and then another, until the flames of triumph blot out the sky, until all his foes fall silent. It is an enduring paradox of the modern City that the more dominant they become, the angrier they get. The craving for trophies and the craving for adversity becomes a self-nourishing cycle, neither quite satisfying the other. Liverpool, Arsenal, Uefa, the Premier League, the media machine, the corrupt cartel, financial regulation, the rule of law itself. We are entering Guardiola\u2019s siege phase, if it hasn\u2019t already begun. And whether it succeeds or whether it fails, it\u2019s not going to want for enemies.",

      "bodyText": "Major rich countries at UN climate talks in Azerbaijan have agreed to lift a global financial offer to help developing nations tackle the climate crisis to $300bn a year, as ministers met through the night in a bid to salvage a deal. The Guardian understands the Azeri hosts brokered a lengthy closed-door meeting with a small group of ministers and delegation heads, including China, the EU, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, the UK, US and Australia, on key areas of dispute on climate finance and the transition away from fossil fuels. It came as the Cop29 summit in Baku, which had been due to finish at 6pm Friday, dragged into Saturday morning. A plenary session had been planned for 10am but did not eventuate. The developing world reacted with anger to a draft $250bn climate finance target on Friday, dismissing it as a \u201cjoke\u201d and far below the amount that is needed to help the poor shift to a low-carbon economy and adapt to the impacts of extreme weather. It prompted a diplomatic effort behind the scenes to increase the offer from developed nations. Multiple sources said the EU and several members of the umbrella group of countries including the UK, US and Australia had indicated they could go to $300bn in exchange for other changes to a draft text released on Friday. The Guardian understands that the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, was ringing round capitals to push for a higher figure. Japan, Switzerland and New Zealand were understood to be among the countries resistant to the $300bn figure late on Friday. A $300bn offer would still fall well short of what developing countries say is necessary, and would likely draw sharp criticism if included in an updated text expected later on Saturday. But with some ministers booked to leave Baku in the hours ahead, countries face a decision on what they are prepared to accept. Several ministers from rich nations have argued that a deal may be easier now than next year, when Donald Trump will be US president and right-wing governments could be returned at elections in several countries, including Germany and Canada, and they do not want to make a commitment they cannot meet. Claudio Angelo, from Observat\u00f3rio do Clima in Brazil, said rich countries had \u201cclearly arrived to ditch their obligations\u201d. \u201cAfter three years of negotiations the first time we ever saw quantum in the text was yesterday,\u201d he said. He said $300bn in grant funding was \u201cway, way below\u201d what developing countries needed. \u201cRemember, many of them are already in deep debt,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have climate finance as the current text proposes will only entrap those countries more.\u201d According to the draft text of a deal circulated on Friday, developing countries would receive at least $1.3tn a year in climate finance by 2035, which is in line with the demands most submitted in advance of this two-week conference. But poor nations wanted much more of that headline finance to come directly from rich countries, preferably in the form of grants rather than loans. They said the offer of $250bn coming from rich countries, with few safeguards over how much would come without strings attached, was much too little. The offer from developed countries is supposed to form the inner core of a \u201clayered\u201d finance settlement, accompanied by a middle layer of new forms of finance such as new taxes on fossil fuels and high-carbon activities, carbon trading and \u201cinnovative\u201d forms of finance; and an outermost layer of investment from the private sector, into projects such as solar and windfarms. These layers would add up to $1.3tn a year, which is the amount that leading economists have calculated is needed in external finance for developing countries to tackle the climate crisis. Many activists have demanded more \u2013 figures of $5tn or $7tn a year have been put forward by some groups, based on the historical responsibilities of developed countries for causing the climate crisis. While climate finance is the major focus at Cop29, other issues also remain unresolved. Azerbaijan, which holds the presidency of the talks, has been criticised for playing down a key commitment to \u201ctransition away from fossil fuels\u201d in draft texts.

Amerdeep Somal, the local government and social care ombudsman, said her caseload was now dominated by complaints from families involving special educational needs (Sen) provision and schools, with more than 90% of complaints being upheld. \u201cOur evidence strongly indicates that the system is not working for children, families or local authorities: resources are a challenge, many organisations lack vital staff and in many areas suitable and affordable support does not exist,\u201d Somal said in her triennial review of operations. \u201cThe result is that young people, and their families, don\u2019t get the help they need and lose vital weeks, months and years of education and development as a result. They don\u2019t get that time back.\u201d Somal expressed frustration that her office was only able to accept complaints about admissions or exclusions involving council-supervised maintained schools, and not those involving state-funded academies or free schools. More than 80% of state secondaries in England are academies, as well as nearly half of all special schools and mainstream primaries. \u201cThis creates an extremely complex landscape where different people have access to different levels of redress depending on which school their child attends, or have no access to redress at all,\u201d Somal said. \u201cThis is neither logical nor is it fair.\u201d Similarly, the ombudsman can only investigate complaints about special needs provision for children assessed for education, health and care plans (EHCPs) but not those with additional needs who do not meet the threshold for a plan. Somal\u2019s report recommends that the government grant the ombudsman\u2019s office the powers to investigate all state schools over complaints involving EHCPs or additional needs support. The Department for Education has been contacted for a response. Complaints about schools and special needs provision accounted for 26% of the local government ombudsman\u2019s cases in 2023-24, with 92% upheld. \u201cA situation where we are upholding nearly 100% of complaints cannot be one that is working for children and their families,\u201d Somal said. A key failing was the inability of many councils to process applications, or then failure to implement EHCPs after they had been agreed with parents, because of a lack of funding, facilities or qualified staff. The staff shortages were highlighted by North Yorkshire county council, which could not recruit sufficient education psychologists despite four recruitment rounds and offering higher salaries, leading to long delays in children receiving support. The ombudsman\u2019s criticisms echo those of the National Audit Office, which recently said the special needs system was \u201cfinancially unsustainable\u201d in its current form. Last year, 576,000 children and young people in England had an EHCP, an assessment and agreement detailing the extra support they require, funded from a council\u2019s high-needs budget. A further 1.2 million children are estimated to have special needs but may not qualify for an EHCP.",

Scientists believe there were originally many more than this \u2013 up to 80 sarsens and many more bluestones., 2:A - The sun is about 1.39 million kilometres in diameter. That amount in centimetres is HUGE \u2013 139 plus nine zeros. , 3:C - Most animals can\u2019t climb down trees head first, but squirrels can. Their back ankles can rotate to about 180 degrees, turning their paws round to grip on to the tree trunk as they go down., 4:A - Double cream has lots of fat, about 48%. When you whip it, the fat traps air, making a thick and stable foam., 5:C - Human skin has three layers: the epidermis, which is the outer layer; the dermis, which is the strong elastic layer with blood vessels, nerves, hair follicles and glands; and the hypodermis, with fat and connective tissue. This layer keeps you from getting too cold or hot and protects muscles and bones.</p>\n    <h3 class=\"quiz__scores-title\">Scores</h3>\n    <ol class=\"quiz__scores\" data-result-groups-length=\"6\">\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"5\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">5 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"4\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">4 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"3\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">3 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"2\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">2 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"0\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">0 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"1\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">1 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n    </ol>\n   </div> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.mollyoldfield.co.uk/\">Molly Oldfield</a> hosts <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/everything-under-the-sun/id1442273607?mt=2\">Everything Under the Sun</a>, a podcast answering children\u2019s questions.

The day given its greeting \u2013 Soho ahoy. It is hard to cycle past Maison Bertaux and not be lured by the delights of a pain au chocolat, pain au raisin, cheese croissant or indeed a croissant to dunk&nbsp;in a cappuccino at Quo Vadis, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;flat white from Flat White on Berwick Street.</p>      <ul> <li><p>Above left: a pot of Barry\u2019s Tea to start the day. Above right: past\u00e9is de nata from Caf\u00e9 de Nata</p></li> </ul> <p>More often than not, there is a call to go and buy something forgotten or&nbsp;not delivered. Cycling around the&nbsp;West End of London has always been a treat, with many a fine spot to make a pit&nbsp;stop. The first of the pastel de nata baked at the custard tart shop [Caf\u00e9 de Nata] opposite the Algerian Coffee Stores are&nbsp;a mighty fine elevenses, and as Gelupo is around the corner, a&nbsp;swift visit for a tub of pistachio and hazelnut ice-cream. </p> <p>Then to Lina Stores for focaccia and mortadella; a wealth of naughty biscuits; salami; prosciutto; a fresh, dripping mozzarella. Pursuits concluded, cravings sated, \u2019tis to the kitchen we go, with extra treats in hand.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Jeremy Lee: \u2018There is no question of hunger games\u2019</p></li> </ul> <p>The kitchen is in full midmorning swing. Beside each chopping board there is always a pot bristling with spoons to dip into simmering pans, ensuring all tastes well while preparing dishes for the menu. For&nbsp;the&nbsp;most part, dishes require tasting so often there is no question of hunger games, and precious little appetite \u2013 or so one might think. Quo&nbsp;Vadis take vittles for the crew as seriously as the dishes prepared for the&nbsp;dining rooms. A joyful find on the pass today is a wholemeal focaccia just out of the oven stuffed with porchetta tonnato and a salad of good things left over from the day before (baked tomatoes, grilled courgettes).</p> <p>At Neal\u2019s Yard Dairy, no visit is complete without tasting at least five different cheeses. If returning to Maison Bertaux, eyes are easily drawn towards the best strawberry tart in the capital (quite right, too, as this is the oldest French patisserie in London), and chocolate eclairs and coffee choux puffs. Then a return to&nbsp;Quo Vadis, the great dame of Dean&nbsp;Street.</p>          <ul> <li><p>Clockwise from top left: croissants from Maison Bertaux; shopping at Neal\u2019s Yard Dairy; focaccia and mortadella from Lina Stores; pistachio and hazelnut ice-cream from Gelupo</p></li> </ul> <p>A dish or three might be sampled through lunch, which may very well include the involvement of puddings. We ensure the peaches, plums, currants and berries are on form, and indeed the pistachio cake, the meringues, ice-cream, sorbet and biscuits. Today, a dear friend drops off a still-warm sausage roll from The Ginger Pig, which has to be shared with the kitchen in the afternoon.</p> <p>An evening stroll along the terrace, through the dining rooms to the club, invariably coincides with the sounding&nbsp;of the martini gong and that&nbsp;terrible choice: a&nbsp;negroni, or a martini? I have my martini biting cold,&nbsp;straight up with&nbsp;a&nbsp;twist.</p>      <ul> <li><p>Above left: pudding at Quo Vadis. Above right: a martini \u2013 biting cold, straight up with a twist</p></li> </ul> <p>A dear friend calls to say he has&nbsp;never eaten at Caf\u00e9 Cecilia, so off we go to plates of crisp fried sage, panisse, ravioli, a lemon sole and&nbsp;a fleet of puddings. I am glad for a&nbsp;walk later as home is just round the&nbsp;corner.</p> <p>* * *</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Breakfast </strong><strong>is black coffee followed&nbsp;by cake\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Milli Taylor,</em><strong> </strong><em>head of the <a href=\"https://ottolenghi.co.uk/pages/ottolenghi-test-kitchen\">Ottolenghi Test Kitchen</a>, London</em></p> <p>All of our cakes are made in our delis, and we taste them every week to keep on top of quality and to see if we can make any improvements or seasonal changes. So, this is breakfast after a&nbsp;black coffee.</p> <p>We make all the viennoiserie at our central kitchen, and then they go out to each site to prove and bake. I eat these with Jens, our pastry development chef, to check the texture and crumb.</p>          <ul> <li><p>Clockwise from top left: viennoiserie from Ottolenghi central kitchen; udon noodles at Koya Ko in Hackney, east London; Ottolenghi cakes to test; octopus and fava beans at Ottolenghi Spitalfields</p></li> </ul> <p>After a welcome few hours of just a savoury spoon of this and that from the development chefs in the test kitchen, we all head to Koya Ko in Hackney, east London, to try our guest chef dish of udon. It is really good to sit down as a team and catch up over a bowl of noodles.</p> <p>We cycle in convoy to Yard Sale Pizza to cook our collaboration recipe with their team. Last month, \u00a31 from every pizza sold went to Magic Breakfast, to provide children with a&nbsp;meal before school.</p>      <ul> <li><p>Above left: manti and (above right) mushrooms and cashew sauce, both at Ottolenghi Spitalfields</p></li> </ul> <p>I jump on a bike to Ottolenghi Spitalfields, where I taste some new dishes with head chef Christos and manager Rui. We try octopus and fava beans, manti [Turkish dumplings] and a new vegan dish of grilled oyster mushrooms and cashew sauce. Then, I&nbsp;cycle home and fall asleep on the sofa. True story.</p> <p>* * *</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I don\u2019t make gravy at home \u2013 I\u2019m fine with Bisto\u2019</strong></h2>    <p><em>Roberta Hall-McCarron, </em><em><strong> </strong>chef</em><em> and owner of <a href=\"https://www.thelittlechartroom.com/\">The Little Chartroom</a>, <a href=\"https://www.eleanore.uk/\">Eleanore</a>, and <a href=\"https://ardfern.uk/\">Ardfern</a>, Edinburgh</em><em> </em></p> <p>Generally, I have weekends off, but I still get up at 6.30am as I have a two-year-old. Sunday is our day to go and do nice things; our daughter gets cabin fever, so we\u2019ll go for a walk, but it has to be coffee first. Then, Hobz Bakery is a 10-minute walk from our flat, so we\u2019ll perch on a seat outside and have one of their amazing pastries or a toastie, which is a punchy breakfast. I might get a peanut miso cookie to take away for later, too.</p>          <ul> <li><p>Top: a breakfast pastry and toastie from Hobz Bakery, Edinburgh. Above: broth and a bagel for lunch</p></li> </ul> <p>Lunch is always pretty chilled. It\u2019s just soup \u2013 ham hock or chicken broth with vegetables, such as mushrooms or broccoli \u2013 and a bagel. Then, there\u2019s always oatcakes in the house, so I might have some with cheese or ham, if I want a snack.</p> <p>Dinner is quite traditional: we tend to do a roast chicken, and the leftovers are great in sandwiches over the next couple of days. Then, lots of green vegetables, cauliflower cheese, yorkshire puddings and tons of gravy. I\u2019m not making the gravy myself at home, though; I\u2019m fine with Bisto, it\u2019s one of those nostalgic things I grew up with. We\u2019ll treat ourselves to something from The Pastry Section for dessert; their chocolate cakes are amazing. We then stick something on the TV and most likely fall asleep while watching.</p> <p>* * *</p> <h2><strong>\u2018When I\u2019m at home and don\u2019t have a lot of time, I\u2019ll cobble together a caprese</strong><strong>. I </strong><strong>could eat this every day</strong><strong>\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Simon Rogan,</em><em> </em><em>chef</em><em> and owner of <a href=\"https://www.lenclume.co.uk/\">L\u2019Enclume</a>, Cartmel, Cumbria</em></p> <p>I flit between having honey porridge with a side of Bovril on toast, which is&nbsp;something I grew up with, or strawberry yoghurt, a cup of tea and an orange juice; or a bowl of muesli with berries and yoghurt, which is quicker and easier to make at work. One of those will fill me up.</p> <p>When I\u2019m at home and don\u2019t have a lot of time at lunch, I\u2019ll cobble together a caprese \u2013 I love it and could eat this every day. For something more substantial, though, I\u2019ll go for a pitta&nbsp;pizza with various toppings (chilli, Italian meats, basil) and a side of chips, salad and garlic mayo.</p>          <ul> <li><p>Clockwise from top left: muesli and berry yoghurt for breakfast; caprese salad; chicken thighs roasted in five-spice; green papaya som tum salad</p></li> </ul> <p>Dinner is never at a set time, depending on if I\u2019m at home, working, or visiting the restaurant. At home, my all-time favourite is a green papaya som tam salad, and I always have a batch of this on the go. Today, I served it with chicken thighs roasted in five-spice, plus some rice. My family loves it.</p> <p>I\u2019ll have a beer or a vodka lime and&nbsp;soda \u2013 I\u2019m trying to reduce my sugar intake, so it\u2019s my drink of choice&nbsp;at the moment. Having said that, I do love a slice of lemon meringue pie for dessert.</p> <p>* * *</p> <h2><strong>\u2018The team eat dinner early, at 5pm \u2013 usually offcuts of the whole animals we have in\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Max Rocha,</em><em> chef and owner of<a href=\"https://www.cafececilia.com/\"> Caf\u00e9 Cecilia</a>, London E8, and author of the <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/cafe-cecilia-cookbook-9781838668600/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article\">Caf\u00e9 Cecilia Cookbook</a></em></p> <p>We serve breakfast at the restaurant Fridays to Sundays, so on those days I\u2019ll get stuck into the breakfast <em>mise en place</em> at about 7.30am and make myself yoghurt and granola. Otherwise, I\u2019ll grab cold porridge and nuts from Marks &amp; Spencer \u2013 there\u2019s something about the cold part I love. I\u2019ll also have sparkling water, then a coffee at 9am.</p> <p>We have a late staff breakfast at 11am, before lunch service. On a Wednesday and Thursday, front-of-house makes it, otherwise whichever&nbsp;chef is on the breakfast shift will. It\u2019s always eggs, because they\u2019re such good energy for the day, so we\u2019ll have either a frittata or scrambled eggs, toast, plus bacon on weekends. Sometimes, we have pancakes as a treat.</p>          <ul> <li><p>Clockwise from top left: cold porridge and nuts from Marks &amp; Spencer for breakfast; lunch prepared for and by the staff at the restaurant \u2013 it will always involve eggs; a snack; chicken caesar salad prepared for staff in the restaurant kitchen</p></li> </ul> <p>I stopped drinking a couple of years ago, so snacks were a big thing for me to alleviate stress. I\u2019m trying to snack less now; I can\u2019t have one of something or I\u2019ll eat a thousand! I might have something around 3pm, though, like a granola bar. And if it\u2019s a busy service, I\u2019ll have a Diet Coke to take the edge off.</p> <p>We eat dinner early, at 5pm, and that\u2019s quite important as I then sleep better. What we have depends on what\u2019s in the kitchen. We get lots of whole animals in, so there\u2019s usually offcuts of lamb legs. We\u2019ll do mince, or lasagne, but today we have chicken caesar salad. I like one of the newer members of staff to make it, as it\u2019s good to learn how to be organised with prep, but it also gives them a creative outlet. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it can also be a lot of tomato pasta, and once in a blue moon I\u2019ll order us all a pizza. When we first opened and I was stressed, I\u2019d get a takeaway when I got home, but that made me feel worse, so after the staff meal that\u2019s me done. It\u2019s hard to wind down after work, but I\u2019m usually asleep by 9pm. It\u2019s not very rock\u2019n\u2019roll, but it suits me \u2013 and the restaurant is better for it.</p> <p>* * *</p> <h2><strong>\u2018</strong><strong>This is the healthy version of me now; I used to stay up drinking until 4am\u2019</strong></h2>    <p><em>Abby Lee,</em><em> </em><em>chef and owner of <a href=\"https://www.mambow.co.uk/\">Mambow</a>, London E5</em><em> </em></p> <p>I\u2019m not a breakfast person. When you stay up so late for work, all you want when you get up in the morning is lots of liquid. I get up around 9am, do some meditation and breathwork, then head straight to work (unless I need to pick up any ingredients). I get to the restaurant around 11am, and I bring the drinks, which is a decaf flat white for me.</p>      <ul> <li><p>Top: a takeaway from Somine in Dalston, east London; Lee delivers the morning drinks to the staff at Mambow</p></li> </ul> <p>There are pastries, such as cinnamon swirls, in the back, as well as fruit. But we all sit down together to eat at about 4.30pm. We alternate who cooks, but this time we have miso butter roast chicken; we always have Chinese-style stir-fry vegetables with oyster sauce, soy sauce, white pepper and leftover chicken stock. We\u2019ll have another salad, too, maybe with red cabbage, za\u2019atar, and crispy onions. As it is a Saturday and we want to use up ingredients, we have an extra treat of calamari. On a good day, we take 45 minutes for our meal, but if we\u2019re in a rush it could be just 15 minutes.</p> <p>From then on, it\u2019s dinner service and pretty hardcore. We love 100Plus, which is an isotonic drink, and we also use it in our cocktails in the restaurant. It\u2019s so good, but otherwise we\u2019ll have juices with turmeric or ginger. I don\u2019t have a sweet tooth, but towards the end of the night, I\u2019ll pick at any desserts we can\u2019t keep.</p> <p>I finish up about half-midnight, and I\u2019ll have a takeaway from Somine in Dalston at 1am. I always get the spiced bulgur wheat box, which comes with good flatbread and the usual garlic-chilli sauce, and the spiced lamb kebab. I\u2019ll have a sleepy tea, which is a Vietnamese herbal tea called tr\u00e0 tim sen, to try to wind down, then I\u2019ll have a hot shower and go to bed at 2.30am. This is the healthy version of me now; I used to stay up drinking until 4am. My body didn\u2019t agree with this cycle of eating, especially when I started. Adrenaline does fill you up and it\u2019s unhealthy, which is why I\u2019ve tried to put in these systems.</p> <p>* * *</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I\u2019ve had to teach myself that there\u2019s a difference between tasting and eating, because I\u2019m a&nbsp;very greedy person</strong><strong>\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Tommy Banks, chef and director of <a href=\"https://www.blackswanoldstead.co.uk/\">The Black Swan at Oldstead</a></em><em>; <a href=\"https://rootsyork.com/\">Roots York</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.abbeyinnbyland.co.uk/dine/\">The Abbey Inn </a>in North Yorkshire</em></p> <p>I eat <em>a lot</em> of eggs, and I have to have them every morning with a cup of Yorkshire Tea. Right now, I\u2019m having six scrambled eggs, but I go through phases \u2013 before this, it was a big omelette. Sometimes I finish the scrambled eggs with cheese, but we\u2019ve been making merguez sausages from our Herdwick lambs, so I\u2019ll have a couple of those as well \u2013 but they\u2019re only small. I would never find myself in a situation where we don\u2019t have eggs in the house.</p> <p>I have a disease called ulcerative colitis, so I\u2019m quite particular about what I eat. I changed my diet last October; my lifestyle was to eat everything and drink most evenings, but I feel so much better now. I\u2019m going to sound like the most boring person, but during the week I always have the same lunch: I love the full-fat cottage cheese and Greek yoghurt from Longley Farm in Yorkshire, and I\u2019ll have a big bowl of that with berries or other fruit, and almond butter. I get so much grief from my team for my diet, but as I\u2019m always in meetings and&nbsp;popping between restaurants, it has to be something I can eat with a spoon. We have amazing staff teas in the restaurant, so I might have some meat from that, but I\u2019m also tasting all the time. I\u2019ve had to teach myself that there\u2019s a difference between tasting and eating, because I\u2019m a very greedy&nbsp;person.</p>      <ul> <li><p>Above left: scrambled eggs with merguez sausages for breakfast. Above right: rib-eye steaks with bearnaise sauce, courgettes from the garden and olive oil potatoes for dinner</p></li> </ul> <p>My day-to-day is generally 8am to 7pm, but if I\u2019m working service then I don\u2019t get home until midnight. As we have animals on the farm, we always have a freezer full of meat at home, and I like that there\u2019s no food miles. My daughter\u2019s favourite thing in the world is any kind of hollandaise sauce, so we have bearnaise with rib-eye steaks, and courgettes from the garden. Most nights, we\u2019ll also have olive oil potatoes: boil new potatoes, crush them with the back of a cup, then roast them in olive oil and salt until super crisp. Whenever I\u2019m at home, this is what we do, then on the weekend we\u2019ll go to our pub, and I\u2019ll&nbsp;fill my boots with a massive ice-cream sundae.</p> <p>* * *</p> <h2><strong>\u2018If I\u2019m peckish, I\u2019ll have green apple with some peanut butter\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Romy Gill, chef and author of<a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/romy-gills-india-9781784886875/\"> Romy&nbsp;Gill\u2019s India</a></em><br>Being freelance, it\u2019s so important to have a routine. I get up at about 7am, then religiously make chai. I love a good sourdough, so sometimes I\u2019ll have that with honey, or homemade jam \u2013 my neighbour recently gave me some blackcurrant jam.</p>          <ul> <li><p>Clockwise from top left: breakfast of sourdough toast with honey or homemade jam; black coffee; apple with peanut butter provides a snack; kidchi (rice and lentils) for dinner</p></li> </ul> <p>I drink a lot of black coffee, then if I\u2019m peckish, I\u2019ll have a green apple with some peanut butter. Otherwise, I&nbsp;don\u2019t really eat anything else, which I know is a bad habit, but intermittent fasting works for me. When I\u2019m cooking, I just don\u2019t feel like eating, and I don\u2019t really taste [while I\u2019m cooking], either. When I was on James Martin\u2019s Saturday Morning, he said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t taste it!\u201d But the seasoning&nbsp;was perfect; I\u2019m Indian and you just know.</p> <p>Khichdi [rice and lentils] is&nbsp;my go-to dinner, and it\u2019s made differently in every state of India. I have a pressure cooker, so I can make it in 10 minutes \u2013 the perfect quick, wholesome meal. You can add a fried egg on top, you can add keema [mince], or I add a radish and onion salad. I was bought up on chutneys and so I\u2019m big on condiments. I put some homemade lemon, ginger and chilli pickle on the side, and I\u2019ll also have some natural yoghurt with black salt, which I love. I&nbsp;have this once a week.</p> <p>* * *</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I\u2019ve found my perfect diet \u2013 although it </strong><em><strong>is</strong></em><strong> a little boring\u2019</strong></h2>    <p><em>Santiago Lastra, co-owner and chef-patron of <a href=\"https://kolrestaurant.com/more-about-santiago/\">KOL</a></em><em><a href=\"https://kolrestaurant.com/more-about-santiago/\"> </a>and</em><em> </em><em><a href=\"https://fondalondon.com/\">Fonda</a></em><em>, both in London</em></p> <p>It\u2019s ironic that chefs often don\u2019t eat well. The hours I work make eating complicated, but I\u2019ve found my perfect diet \u2013 although it <em>is</em> a little boring. I wake up at 6am, and have one big date, and a mushroom coffee. I then go to the gym and afterwards I\u2019ll have an acai shake with berries, banana, sometimes apple juice.</p>      <ul> <li><p>Above left: mushroom coffee. Above right: a single large date for breakfast</p></li> </ul> <p>I used to have around 10 coffees a day, but then you forget that you\u2019re hungry. Now, I pick up a matcha latte on the way to work, as well as a seaweed, tuna or salmon onigiri, which I\u2019ll have around 11am. As a chef, if you don\u2019t eat anything you\u2019ll still eat, because you\u2019re tasting so many things; it could be a chilli tasting, or just elements of all the dishes \u2013 but you need to force yourself to have a routine so there\u2019s some consistency.</p>          <ul> <li><p>Clockwise from top left: onigiri; a matcha latte; mochi for dessert; miso soup for dinner</p></li> </ul> <p>At 3.30pm, we have our staff meal. We always have salad and vegetables, and try to add something fermented, such as sauerkraut or fermented tomatoes. Then, it depends on who is cooking: sometimes it will be Korean, sometimes Indian, or grilled chicken with rice and vegetables, or lasagne. But the meal must include salad and a carb (rice, quinoa, barley), and then it can be chicken or fish \u2013 I\u2019ll usually be standing very close to the fish tray.</p> <p>At about 7pm, I have a cup of hojicha (toasted matcha); it\u2019s an amazing tea because it gives you energy. I get home about 10.30pm and make myself soup. I love soup: miso (maybe with pickled or fermented mushrooms), noodle soup, lentil soup. Work can be stressful, so it\u2019s nice to have a bowl of soup, maybe followed by mochi or a cookie.</p> <p>* * *</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I\u2019ve calmed down on the amount of coffee I drink \u2013 no more than three cups.

I\u2019ve calmed down on the amount of coffee I drink \u2013 no more than three cups, perhaps four if it\u2019s a really big day. Today, I\u2019ll go for a 45-minute run, so I need carbohydrates. There\u2019s a lovely cafe in Padstow called Cherry Trees, which is where I got my sandwich: granary bread, tuna, cucumber. This plus a flat white is a&nbsp;real treat.</p>      <ul> <li><p>Above left: tuna and cucumber sandwich for lunch at the Cherry Trees cafe in Padstow; a family dinner of steak, sweetcorn, rocket with cherry tomatoes, cucumber and feta</p></li> </ul> <p>We try to eat dinner as a family, something like steak, sweetcorn, and I&nbsp;love rocket with cherry tomatoes, cucumber, feta, plus some nice olive oil and a bit of balsamic vinegar. I had a medical last year, and it&nbsp;turns out I wasn\u2019t eating enough; I&nbsp;would drink coffee all day then get home starving and eat the wrong&nbsp;thing. I was heading for diabetes and had to do something about it, but I didn\u2019t want to feel as if I&nbsp;was on a diet. And what\u2019s not to like about grass-fed steak? Although, obviously, I know there\u2019s a cost attached to it.

      "bodyText": "\u2018A dish or three might be sampled through lunch, which may very well include the involvement of puddings\u2019 Jeremy Lee, chef and co-owner of Quo Vadis, London W1 A first pot of the day of Barry\u2019s Tea (milk, no sugar) is vital, and where a biscuit and newspaper were once the order of the day, for the most part, a biscuit is now a treat, usually a Rich Tea or a Le Petit Beurre. The day given its greeting \u2013 Soho ahoy. It is hard to cycle past Maison Bertaux and not be lured by the delights of a pain au chocolat, pain au raisin, cheese croissant or indeed a croissant to dunk in a cappuccino at Quo Vadis, or a flat white from Flat White on Berwick Street. Above left: a pot of Barry\u2019s Tea to start the day. Above right: past\u00e9is de nata from Caf\u00e9 de Nata More often than not, there is a call to go and buy something forgotten or not delivered. Cycling around the West End of London has always been a treat, with many a fine spot to make a pit stop. The first of the pastel de nata baked at the custard tart shop [Caf\u00e9 de Nata] opposite the Algerian Coffee Stores are a mighty fine elevenses, and as Gelupo is around the corner, a swift visit for a tub of pistachio and hazelnut ice-cream. Then to Lina Stores for focaccia and mortadella; a wealth of naughty biscuits; salami; prosciutto; a fresh, dripping mozzarella. Pursuits concluded, cravings sated, \u2019tis to the kitchen we go, with extra treats in hand. Jeremy Lee: \u2018There is no question of hunger games\u2019 The kitchen is in full midmorning swing. Beside each chopping board there is always a pot bristling with spoons to dip into simmering pans, ensuring all tastes well while preparing dishes for the menu. For the most part, dishes require tasting so often there is no question of hunger games, and precious little appetite \u2013 or so one might think. Quo Vadis take vittles for the crew as seriously as the dishes prepared for the dining rooms. A joyful find on the pass today is a wholemeal focaccia just out of the oven stuffed with porchetta tonnato and a salad of good things left over from the day before (baked tomatoes, grilled courgettes). At Neal\u2019s Yard Dairy, no visit is complete without tasting at least five different cheeses. If returning to Maison Bertaux, eyes are easily drawn towards the best strawberry tart in the capital (quite right, too, as this is the oldest French patisserie in London), and chocolate eclairs and coffee choux puffs. Then a return to Quo Vadis, the great dame of Dean Street. Clockwise from top left: croissants from Maison Bertaux; shopping at Neal\u2019s Yard Dairy; focaccia and mortadella from Lina Stores; pistachio and hazelnut ice-cream from Gelupo A dish or three might be sampled through lunch, which may very well include the involvement of puddings. We ensure the peaches, plums, currants and berries are on form, and indeed the pistachio cake, the meringues, ice-cream, sorbet and biscuits. Today, a dear friend drops off a still-warm sausage roll from The Ginger Pig, which has to be shared with the kitchen in the afternoon. An evening stroll along the terrace, through the dining rooms to the club, invariably coincides with the sounding of the martini gong and that terrible choice: a negroni, or a martini? I have my martini biting cold, straight up with a twist. Above left: pudding at Quo Vadis. Above right: a martini \u2013 biting cold, straight up with a twist A dear friend calls to say he has never eaten at Caf\u00e9 Cecilia, so off we go to plates of crisp fried sage, panisse, ravioli, a lemon sole and a fleet of puddings. I am glad for a walk later as home is just round the corner. * * * \u2018Breakfast is black coffee followed by cake\u2019 Milli Taylor, head of the Ottolenghi Test Kitchen, London All of our cakes are made in our delis, and we taste them every week to keep on top of quality and to see if we can make any improvements or seasonal changes. So, this is breakfast after a black coffee. We make all the viennoiserie at our central kitchen, and then they go out to each site to prove and bake. I eat these with Jens, our pastry development chef, to check the texture and crumb. Clockwise from top left: viennoiserie from Ottolenghi central kitchen; udon noodles at Koya Ko in Hackney, east London; Ottolenghi cakes to test; octopus and fava beans at Ottolenghi Spitalfields After a welcome few hours of just a savoury spoon of this and that from the development chefs in the test kitchen, we all head to Koya Ko in Hackney, east London, to try our guest chef dish of udon. It is really good to sit down as a team and catch up over a bowl of noodles. We cycle in convoy to Yard Sale Pizza to cook our collaboration recipe with their team. Last month, \u00a31 from every pizza sold went to Magic Breakfast, to provide children with a meal before school. Above left: manti and (above right) mushrooms and cashew sauce, both at Ottolenghi Spitalfields I jump on a bike to Ottolenghi Spitalfields, where I taste some new dishes with head chef Christos and manager Rui. We try octopus and fava beans, manti [Turkish dumplings] and a new vegan dish of grilled oyster mushrooms and cashew sauce. Then, I cycle home and fall asleep on the sofa. True story. * * * \u2018I don\u2019t make gravy at home \u2013 I\u2019m fine with Bisto\u2019 Roberta Hall-McCarron, chef and owner of The Little Chartroom, Eleanore, and Ardfern, Edinburgh Generally, I have weekends off, but I still get up at 6.30am as I have a two-year-old. Sunday is our day to go and do nice things; our daughter gets cabin fever, so we\u2019ll go for a walk, but it has to be coffee first. Then, Hobz Bakery is a 10-minute walk from our flat, so we\u2019ll perch on a seat outside and have one of their amazing pastries or a toastie, which is a punchy breakfast. I might get a peanut miso cookie to take away for later, too. Top: a breakfast pastry and toastie from Hobz Bakery, Edinburgh. Above: broth and a bagel for lunch Lunch is always pretty chilled. It\u2019s just soup \u2013 ham hock or chicken broth with vegetables, such as mushrooms or broccoli \u2013 and a bagel. Then, there\u2019s always oatcakes in the house, so I might have some with cheese or ham, if I want a snack. Dinner is quite traditional: we tend to do a roast chicken, and the leftovers are great in sandwiches over the next couple of days. Then, lots of green vegetables, cauliflower cheese, yorkshire puddings and tons of gravy. I\u2019m not making the gravy myself at home, though; I\u2019m fine with Bisto, it\u2019s one of those nostalgic things I grew up with. We\u2019ll treat ourselves to something from The Pastry Section for dessert; their chocolate cakes are amazing. We then stick something on the TV and most likely fall asleep while watching. * * * \u2018When I\u2019m at home and don\u2019t have a lot of time, I\u2019ll cobble together a caprese. I could eat this every day\u2019 Simon Rogan, chef and owner of L\u2019Enclume, Cartmel, Cumbria I flit between having honey porridge with a side of Bovril on toast, which is something I grew up with, or strawberry yoghurt, a cup of tea and an orange juice; or a bowl of muesli with berries and yoghurt, which is quicker and easier to make at work. One of those will fill me up. When I\u2019m at home and don\u2019t have a lot of time at lunch, I\u2019ll cobble together a caprese \u2013 I love it and could eat this every day. For something more substantial, though, I\u2019ll go for a pitta pizza with various toppings (chilli, Italian meats, basil) and a side of chips, salad and garlic mayo. Clockwise from top left: muesli and berry yoghurt for breakfast; caprese salad; chicken thighs roasted in five-spice; green papaya som tum salad Dinner is never at a set time, depending on if I\u2019m at home, working, or visiting the restaurant. At home, my all-time favourite is a green papaya som tam salad, and I always have a batch of this on the go. Today, I served it with chicken thighs roasted in five-spice, plus some rice. My family loves it. I\u2019ll have a beer or a vodka lime and soda \u2013 I\u2019m trying to reduce my sugar intake, so it\u2019s my drink of choice at the moment. Having said that, I do love a slice of lemon meringue pie for dessert. * * * \u2018The team eat dinner early, at 5pm \u2013 usually offcuts of the whole animals we have in\u2019 Max Rocha, chef and owner of Caf\u00e9 Cecilia, London E8, and author of the Caf\u00e9 Cecilia Cookbook We serve breakfast at the restaurant Fridays to Sundays, so on those days I\u2019ll get stuck into the breakfast mise en place at about 7.30am and make myself yoghurt and granola. Otherwise, I\u2019ll grab cold porridge and nuts from Marks &amp; Spencer \u2013 there\u2019s something about the cold part I love. I\u2019ll also have sparkling water, then a coffee at 9am. We have a late staff breakfast at 11am, before lunch service. On a Wednesday and Thursday, front-of-house makes it, otherwise whichever chef is on the breakfast shift will. It\u2019s always eggs, because they\u2019re such good energy for the day, so we\u2019ll have either a frittata or scrambled eggs, toast, plus bacon on weekends. Sometimes, we have pancakes as a treat. Clockwise from top left: cold porridge and nuts from Marks &amp; Spencer for breakfast; lunch prepared for and by the staff at the restaurant \u2013 it will always involve eggs; a snack; chicken caesar salad prepared for staff in the restaurant kitchen I stopped drinking a couple of years ago, so snacks were a big thing for me to alleviate stress. I\u2019m trying to snack less now; I can\u2019t have one of something or I\u2019ll eat a thousand! I might have something around 3pm, though, like a granola bar. And if it\u2019s a busy service, I\u2019ll have a Diet Coke to take the edge off. We eat dinner early, at 5pm, and that\u2019s quite important as I then sleep better. What we have depends on what\u2019s in the kitchen. We get lots of whole animals in, so there\u2019s usually offcuts of lamb legs. We\u2019ll do mince, or lasagne, but today we have chicken caesar salad. I like one of the newer members of staff to make it, as it\u2019s good to learn how to be organised with prep, but it also gives them a creative outlet. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it can also be a lot of tomato pasta, and once in a blue moon I\u2019ll order us all a pizza. When we first opened and I was stressed, I\u2019d get a takeaway when I got home, but that made me feel worse, so after the staff meal that\u2019s me done. It\u2019s hard to wind down after work, but I\u2019m usually asleep by 9pm. It\u2019s not very rock\u2019n\u2019roll, but it suits me \u2013 and the restaurant is better for it. * * * \u2018This is the healthy version of me now; I used to stay up drinking until 4am\u2019 Abby Lee, chef and owner of Mambow, London E5 I\u2019m not a breakfast person. When you stay up so late for work, all you want when you get up in the morning is lots of liquid. I get up around 9am, do some meditation and breathwork, then head straight to work (unless I need to pick up any ingredients). I get to the restaurant around 11am, and I bring the drinks, which is a decaf flat white for me. Top: a takeaway from Somine in Dalston, east London; Lee delivers the morning drinks to the staff at Mambow There are pastries, such as cinnamon swirls, in the back, as well as fruit. But we all sit down together to eat at about 4.30pm. We alternate who cooks, but this time we have miso butter roast chicken; we always have Chinese-style stir-fry vegetables with oyster sauce, soy sauce, white pepper and leftover chicken stock. We\u2019ll have another salad, too, maybe with red cabbage, za\u2019atar, and crispy onions. As it is a Saturday and we want to use up ingredients, we have an extra treat of calamari. On a good day, we take 45 minutes for our meal, but if we\u2019re in a rush it could be just 15 minutes. From then on, it\u2019s dinner service and pretty hardcore. We love 100Plus, which is an isotonic drink, and we also use it in our cocktails in the restaurant. It\u2019s so good, but otherwise we\u2019ll have juices with turmeric or ginger. I don\u2019t have a sweet tooth, but towards the end of the night, I\u2019ll pick at any desserts we can\u2019t keep. I finish up about half-midnight, and I\u2019ll have a takeaway from Somine in Dalston at 1am. I always get the spiced bulgur wheat box, which comes with good flatbread and the usual garlic-chilli sauce, and the spiced lamb kebab. I\u2019ll have a sleepy tea, which is a Vietnamese herbal tea called tr\u00e0 tim sen, to try to wind down, then I\u2019ll have a hot shower and go to bed at 2.30am. This is the healthy version of me now; I used to stay up drinking until 4am. My body didn\u2019t agree with this cycle of eating, especially when I started. Adrenaline does fill you up and it\u2019s unhealthy, which is why I\u2019ve tried to put in these systems. * * * \u2018I\u2019ve had to teach myself that there\u2019s a difference between tasting and eating, because I\u2019m a very greedy person\u2019 Tommy Banks, chef and director of The Black Swan at Oldstead; Roots York, and The Abbey Inn in North Yorkshire I eat a lot of eggs, and I have to have them every morning with a cup of Yorkshire Tea. Right now, I\u2019m having six scrambled eggs, but I go through phases \u2013 before this, it was a big omelette. Sometimes I finish the scrambled eggs with cheese, but we\u2019ve been making merguez sausages from our Herdwick lambs, so I\u2019ll have a couple of those as well \u2013 but they\u2019re only small. I would never find myself in a situation where we don\u2019t have eggs in the house. I have a disease called ulcerative colitis, so I\u2019m quite particular about what I eat. I changed my diet last October; my lifestyle was to eat everything and drink most evenings, but I feel so much better now. I\u2019m going to sound like the most boring person, but during the week I always have the same lunch: I love the full-fat cottage cheese and Greek yoghurt from Longley Farm in Yorkshire, and I\u2019ll have a big bowl of that with berries or other fruit, and almond butter. I get so much grief from my team for my diet, but as I\u2019m always in meetings and popping between restaurants, it has to be something I can eat with a spoon. We have amazing staff teas in the restaurant, so I might have some meat from that, but I\u2019m also tasting all the time. I\u2019ve had to teach myself that there\u2019s a difference between tasting and eating, because I\u2019m a very greedy person. Above left: scrambled eggs with merguez sausages for breakfast. Above right: rib-eye steaks with bearnaise sauce, courgettes from the garden and olive oil potatoes for dinner My day-to-day is generally 8am to 7pm, but if I\u2019m working service then I don\u2019t get home until midnight. As we have animals on the farm, we always have a freezer full of meat at home, and I like that there\u2019s no food miles. My daughter\u2019s favourite thing in the world is any kind of hollandaise sauce, so we have bearnaise with rib-eye steaks, and courgettes from the garden. Most nights, we\u2019ll also have olive oil potatoes: boil new potatoes, crush them with the back of a cup, then roast them in olive oil and salt until super crisp. Whenever I\u2019m at home, this is what we do, then on the weekend we\u2019ll go to our pub, and I\u2019ll fill my boots with a massive ice-cream sundae. * * * \u2018If I\u2019m peckish, I\u2019ll have green apple with some peanut butter\u2019 Romy Gill, chef and author of Romy Gill\u2019s India Being freelance, it\u2019s so important to have a routine. I get up at about 7am, then religiously make chai. I love a good sourdough, so sometimes I\u2019ll have that with honey, or homemade jam \u2013 my neighbour recently gave me some blackcurrant jam. Clockwise from top left: breakfast of sourdough toast with honey or homemade jam; black coffee; apple with peanut butter provides a snack; kidchi (rice and lentils) for dinner I drink a lot of black coffee, then if I\u2019m peckish, I\u2019ll have a green apple with some peanut butter. Otherwise, I don\u2019t really eat anything else, which I know is a bad habit, but intermittent fasting works for me. When I\u2019m cooking, I just don\u2019t feel like eating, and I don\u2019t really taste [while I\u2019m cooking], either. When I was on James Martin\u2019s Saturday Morning, he said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t taste it!\u201d But the seasoning was perfect; I\u2019m Indian and you just know. Khichdi [rice and lentils] is my go-to dinner, and it\u2019s made differently in every state of India. I have a pressure cooker, so I can make it in 10 minutes \u2013 the perfect quick, wholesome meal. You can add a fried egg on top, you can add keema [mince], or I add a radish and onion salad. I was bought up on chutneys and so I\u2019m big on condiments. I put some homemade lemon, ginger and chilli pickle on the side, and I\u2019ll also have some natural yoghurt with black salt, which I love. I have this once a week. * * * \u2018I\u2019ve found my perfect diet \u2013 although it is a little boring\u2019 Santiago Lastra, co-owner and chef-patron of KOL and Fonda, both in London It\u2019s ironic that chefs often don\u2019t eat well. The hours I work make eating complicated, but I\u2019ve found my perfect diet \u2013 although it is a little boring. I wake up at 6am, and have one big date, and a mushroom coffee. I then go to the gym and afterwards I\u2019ll have an acai shake with berries, banana, sometimes apple juice. Above left: mushroom coffee. Above right: a single large date for breakfast I used to have around 10 coffees a day, but then you forget that you\u2019re hungry. Now, I pick up a matcha latte on the way to work, as well as a seaweed, tuna or salmon onigiri, which I\u2019ll have around 11am. As a chef, if you don\u2019t eat anything you\u2019ll still eat, because you\u2019re tasting so many things; it could be a chilli tasting, or just elements of all the dishes \u2013 but you need to force yourself to have a routine so there\u2019s some consistency. Clockwise from top left: onigiri; a matcha latte; mochi for dessert; miso soup for dinner At 3.30pm, we have our staff meal. We always have salad and vegetables, and try to add something fermented, such as sauerkraut or fermented tomatoes. Then, it depends on who is cooking: sometimes it will be Korean, sometimes Indian, or grilled chicken with rice and vegetables, or lasagne. But the meal must include salad and a carb (rice, quinoa, barley), and then it can be chicken or fish \u2013 I\u2019ll usually be standing very close to the fish tray. At about 7pm, I have a cup of hojicha (toasted matcha); it\u2019s an amazing tea because it gives you energy. I get home about 10.30pm and make myself soup. I love soup: miso (maybe with pickled or fermented mushrooms), noodle soup, lentil soup. Work can be stressful, so it\u2019s nice to have a bowl of soup, maybe followed by mochi or a cookie. * * * \u2018I\u2019ve calmed down on the amount of coffee I drink \u2013 no more than three cups. Perhaps four on a big day\u2019 Paul Ainsworth, chef-owner of Paul Ainsworth at No 6, and Caff\u00e8 Rojano, both in Padstow, Cornwall, and The Mariners, Rock, Cornwall I always take Sundays off, they\u2019re sacred, but I try to take a second day, too. During the week, I wake up and have an electrolyte drink over ice; it makes me feel sharp. Then, a couple of hours later, I\u2019ll have my first coffee. I\u2019ve calmed down on the amount of coffee I drink \u2013 no more than three cups, perhaps four if it\u2019s a really big day. Today, I\u2019ll go for a 45-minute run, so I need carbohydrates. There\u2019s a lovely cafe in Padstow called Cherry Trees, which is where I got my sandwich: granary bread, tuna, cucumber. This plus a flat white is a real treat. Above left: tuna and cucumber sandwich for lunch at the Cherry Trees cafe in Padstow; a family dinner of steak, sweetcorn, rocket with cherry tomatoes, cucumber and feta We try to eat dinner as a family, something like steak, sweetcorn, and I love rocket with cherry tomatoes, cucumber, feta, plus some nice olive oil and a bit of balsamic vinegar. I had a medical last year, and it turns out I wasn\u2019t eating enough; I would drink coffee all day then get home starving and eat the wrong thing. I was heading for diabetes and had to do something about it, but I didn\u2019t want to feel as if I was on a diet. And what\u2019s not to like about grass-fed steak? Although, obviously, I know there\u2019s a cost attached to it. Otherwise, we\u2019ll have roast chicken thighs, new potatoes with a nice dollop of butter and some sea salt, and a good portion of steamed broccoli. \u2022 Set stylist: Victoria Twyman.

      "bodyText": "Labour swept to power in the wake of a cost of living crisis that hit households hard, with the price of food and energy rocketing alongside the impact of Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous mini-budget on mortgage rates. At 2.3%, inflation is nowhere the 10% peak after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, but it is creeping up, and could hit 3% in 2025, say forecasters. Here are some of the pressures households are likely to face in the coming months at a time when the government claims to be \u201cfixing the foundations\u201d of the economy. Energy prices Ofgem announced its latest price cap on Friday morning, with average energy bills to increase by 1.2% from January, to \u00a31,738 a year. The forecasters Cornwall Insight say the cap is likely to come back down again in April, by a modest 1.4% \u2013 but that will make little difference for households struggling to make ends meet over the winter. Mindful of the backlash over the cutting of the winter fuel payment for most pensioners, ministers have persuaded the energy sector to set aside \u00a3500m for this winter to cushion the blow for some of the hardest hit households \u2013 including by writing off debts for some. But Citizens Advice, which advises cash-strapped consumers, said the total energy debt owed by households to their suppliers is now \u00a33.7bn \u2013 and called for direct support from the government. \u201cWithout government action, millions are at risk of being left in the cold this winter and beyond,\u201d said its head of energy policy, Alex Belsham-Harris. Even comfortably-off consumers may note that while utility bills are no longer rocketing, they remain a good 40% higher than the \u00a31,200 a year or so they were before the Ukraine war. And with geopolitical uncertainty high, as Donald Trump prepares to arrive in the White House, energy prices are not expected to return to those levels any time soon. Housing costs The cost of fixed-rate mortgage deals has been creeping up in recent weeks, and the bigger than expected rise in inflation in October has fuelled expectations that lenders will continue to increase rates. That is unwelcome news for would-be homebuyers who want the security offered by a fixed rate, as well as anyone whose existing mortgage deal is coming to an end. The financial data provider Moneyfacts reported that the average new five-year deal was 5.26% on Thursday \u2013 compared with 5.09% on the morning of the budget on 30 October. That means someone who took out a \u00a3200,000 five-year fixed mortgage on Thursday is paying \u00a320 a month \u2013 or \u00a3240 a year \u2013 more than if they had signed up for an equivalent deal a few hours before Rachel Reeves set out her budget. Rents have been increasing sharply too. The latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) data showed an 8.7% jump in average rents across the UK over the past year \u2013 a rise of more than \u00a3100 a month. The \u00a325bn increase in employer NICs There is growing concern that the increase in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) next April will raise prices in the shops, hold back wages and hiring and potentially dent economic growth. Labour plans to raise \u00a325bn from a 1.2% increase in employer NICs and a cut in the salary threshold when employers first start contributing, from \u00a39,100 to \u00a35,000. If businesses are able to pass on the costs, it could lead to job cuts and higher prices. Retailers have warned of a \u00a37bn increase in annual costs. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, estimates that workers will bear about 60% of the NICs increase initially, rising to 76% in the medium term. Those businesses able to offload some of the cost to consumers in higher prices will push up inflation, potentially persuading the Bank of England to keep interest rates higher for longer. The BoE\u2019s latest forecasts, released three weeks ago, suggested the budget would raise inflation by half a percentage point at its peak, based on the impact being split across prices, profit margins, workforce levels and wages. Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies Evidence is emerging that Donald Trump will have a cabinet full of loyalists who will cheer him on as he imposes tariffs on US imports. Within hours of taking office in January next year, the next president can use executive powers to raise tariffs and rely on Republican majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives to back him up. Higher tariffs increase the cost of imported goods. China is the focus. Experts expect the tariffs to be phased in over four to six months. The delay will allow Trump to make demands on trading partners in exchange for more lenient treatment. The UK and mainland Europe are expected to avoid the 60% tariffs imposed on China, but could still find their exports to the US hit by 10% or even 20% tariffs. Some of the impact of the tariffs on US consumers could be mitigated if the dollar appreciates against other currencies as a result of the policy, as many economists expect; but a weaker pound would be tough for UK consumers, driving up the cost of imported goods and raising inflation. Research by Dr Aur\u00e9lien Saussay for the Grantham Institute, which researches the climate crisis and environment, showed extra tariffs would rebound first on the US, cutting gross domestic product (GDP) by -0.64%, before hitting the Chinese economy with a 0.68% reduction, and the EU with a more modest -0.11% fall. Food Surging food prices were one of the key factors driving inflation through 2022 and 2023, as well as one of the most visible signals to consumers of the cost of living crisis. At one point, the annual inflation rate for food products was an extraordinary 19%, hitting shoppers hard every time they filled up a basket. The latest ONS data showed food price inflation is now a much more manageable 1.9% a year; but it has not dipped below zero, which would herald falling prices, so spending a lot more on the weekly shop has become a new normal. Food prices are expected to become more volatile because of the climate crisis, with more extreme weather and substantial shifts in seasonal patterns. These can lead to spikes in the price of individual products, with olive oil and cocoa being recent examples, or across-the-board increases, when weather patterns are out of kilter with historic norms.",

I&nbsp;instantly feel myself relax \u2013 this place, hidden in a forested valley in Romania\u2019s Carpathian mountains, is a&nbsp;dreamy oasis for a winter weekend, and somewhere I have been before for&nbsp;proper R&amp;R.</p>    <p>In past centuries, people from all over the Austro-Hungarian empire, of&nbsp;which the region of Covasna, surrounding Zabola village and castle were once part, came here to heal. The&nbsp;area, above a dormant volcano (last eruption: 20,000 years ago), has bubbly mineral springs below the surface but was never as famous as the spas of Bad Gastein in Austria or Karlovy Vary in the Czech Republic, and hence is still affordable. Rooms at Zabola range from \u20ac80 to \u20ac300 a night, with treatments from \u20ac30, while the bus from Bra\u015fov city to Covasna takes an&nbsp;hour and costs less than \u20ac20.</p> <p>After being shown to my room, I&nbsp;begin my retreat with a gin and tonic on the castle\u2019s terrace (happily, the vibe here isn\u2019t strictly alcohol-free), soaking up the thin warmth of a winter sun. Snow tops the peaks around us, visible as I amble up the hill behind the estate to the Finnish sauna in the woods. I watch the sun dip beyond the distant pines as I steam. Every so often my reverie is broken as I&nbsp;brave the icy plunge pool outside.</p>    <p>Before the second world war, Count \u00c1rmin Mikes, who lived in Zabola castle, planned to set up a \u201chealing hotel\u201d by Saint Anne\u2019s lake nearby. He started building wooden huts next to the mineral springs for bathers to change and warm up in. Then war broke out, followed by the communist takeover of Romania. The bathing infrastructure was destroyed and life in this quiet valley became as turbulent as the bubbling earth beneath it.</p> <p>The aristocratic Mikes family were&nbsp;kicked off their land in 1949 by the communists, who used the castle as a hospital for 40 years. Residents of&nbsp;Zabola village were pressed into collective farms, while the Mikes family were sent to penal camps as \u201cenemies of the state\u201d. One daughter, Katalin Mikes,<strong> </strong>escaped abroad.</p> <p>A decade after Romania\u2019s communist dictator Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu was overthrown in 1989, Katalin\u2019s children, the Roy Chowdhurys, scions of Transylvanian and Bengali nobles, reclaimed the crumbling property. They restored it as a hotel with 32 rooms, including 11 new additions this year of self-contained cottages on the estate. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Keen to stimulate the local economy, the family has teamed up with guides who offer activities from hiking to hot-spring hunting in the surrounding forests</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As well as the sauna in the woods, Zabola has a spa in the castle grounds with a classic sauna and hot tub, and treatments ranging from hot stones to full body massages.

Keen to stimulate the local economy, the family teamed up with guides who offer activities from hiking to hot-spring hunting in the surrounding forests. For my second day, I booked a hike with Zabola\u2019s partner geologist, Zolt\u00e1n Albert, to find the fabled natural springs. The purest ones are rigged up to drinking taps, and locals sip from them regularly, earning them the nickname \u201cthe rusty stomachs\u201d. Apparently, the&nbsp;water, with its high iron and magnesium content, is an excellent hangover cure, reduces inflammation and is great for muscles.</p> <p>After hiking through pretty woods for an hour, we find a spring and test the water. It tastes foul: fizzy and eggy with notes of bicarbonate of soda. A&nbsp;glass or two is \u201chealthy, good stuff\u201d, says Zolt\u00e1n, but he recommends that first-timers exercise caution. Too much intense mineral content can cause stomach upset. </p>    <p>Down the hill in Covasna village, Zolt\u00e1n shows me another local healing method unique to this region: a mofetta basin. It\u2019s a wooden sauna-like structure with a layer of pure carbon dioxide low to the ground (you&nbsp;can\u2019t see the layer of gas inside but markers indicate the level, which should never be too high), and several small spas around Covasna town have them. Standing in a mofetta helps dilate blood vessels to let blood flow&nbsp;better. Zolt\u00e1n\u2019s father was a&nbsp;cardiologist in the local hospital, where they still use mofette to cure various conditions. I try standing in the wooden basin at the cardiology centre for 10 minutes, and am pleasantly surprised by the warming, energising effect through my body.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The family battled the region\u2019s authorities for 15\u00a0years to\u00a0reclaim their estate.

When I visited in winter last year, there were horse-drawn sledge tours and ice skating on the lake.

      "body": "<p>A hearty endorsement from me this week, when the lauded-in-the-US-and-only-available-here-after-many-many-months three-parter Ren Faire comes to Sky Documentaries (Friday, 9pm). It is almost impossible to describe this show \u2013 in which a self-appointed \u201cKing\u201d of the US\u2019s longest-running renaissance fayre tries to find the right person to take over before he dies \u2013 without mentioning another HBO show in which an old man who pulses with impenetrable anger and weird horniness chooses someone to take over his job, and I have read a lot of coverage of it that hasn\u2019t even tried. So I\u2019m not going to, either: bit like Succession, isn\u2019t it?</p> <p>Ren Faire focuses on the power struggle beneath George Coulam, the octogenarian self-described visionary who created the Texas Renaissance festival in 1974. The festival only runs for six weeks a year, but in that time welcomes a half-million visitors and turns over millions of dollars. There are jesters and jousts and you can eat turkey drumsticks like they did in olden times. Men in steampunk-style hats say \u201cmy lord!\u201d to you as you walk around and chide you for wearing modern fleeces. I don\u2019t know how this makes millions of dollars either, but it does, and that\u2019s why everyone wants a piece of it.</p> <p>The chief piece-wanters are Jeff Baldwin, the festival\u2019s head of entertainment and an almost disgustingly loyal servant of the king, and Louie Migliaccio, best described as \u201cadult man who likes sugar-free energy drinks\u201d. Jeff wants to maintain the park exactly as George envisioned it, and is not-so-subtly hinting that the best person to do that job is him; Louie wants to run the park as what it is, a business, and is trying to get the bank loans to buy it. George, for what it\u2019s worth, keeps going on sugar-baby dates with mid-20s goths and makes them fill out a survey saying whether they have had breast augmentation surgery or&nbsp;not, and seems ghoulishly drunk&nbsp;on his own mead.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHZUVTrrexE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CHZUVTrrexE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There are two notables about Ren Faire, though, that make it so worth your time: the woozy style of it, and the incredible buy-in from the documentary subjects. It\u2019s the second notable work from film-maker Lance Oppenheim, who I am devastated to report is 28 years old, after 2020\u2019s fantastic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/may/13/some-kind-of-heaven-review-documentary-the-villages-florida-retirement-community\">Some Kind of Heaven</a> (about Florida retirement complex The Villages), and it feels like the arrival of a new and influential visual voice in documentary-making. Shots play with colour and light and lens blur \u2013 where the establishing of the renaissance fayre itself made me write in my notes \u201cwhy don\u2019t we all live like this?\u201d \u2013 and crucially he leans in to the fantasy weirdness of it all, with staged and semi-staged scenes with talking lizards, vision quests, and the subjects acting out&nbsp;their thoughts and feelings without just saying \u201cis this mic on?&nbsp;OK, so \u2013 \u201d in front of a wall.</p> <p>Ren Faire is produced by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/16/good-time-directors-the-safdie-brothers-robert-pattinson-was-just-a-guy-chasing-work\">Safdie Brothers</a>\u2019 Elara Pictures, and it has the same disconcerting weirdness of last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/nov/11/emma-stone-nathan-fielder-the-curse-review-this-exquisitely-cringe-worthy-drama-is-like-nothing-else-on-tv\">The Curse</a>. There are times when you don\u2019t really know where it ends and the style begins: at one point I had to pause it and do a few searches to ensure this wasn\u2019t, actually, an incredibly clever hyper-observed scripted mockumentary \u2013 and that is something I personally read as \u201cgood and smart\u201d not \u201cannoying, distracting\u201d. This could be a small story in the middle of Texas: instead it turned my sense of reality&nbsp;upside down.</p> <p>Documentary has been hit-and-miss the last few years \u2013 the blockbuster success of Tiger King has made every weirdo think they are one snappy soundbite away from mega-fame, and that has hurt the genre a lot. People act strangely when a camera is on them, then they soften and get used to it, and then \u2013 in the best documentaries, anyway \u2013 they quietly tell you the most devastating or deranged thing you\u2019ve ever heard, all while watering their plants or something.</p> <p>Ren Faire is full of moments like this \u2013 you see people lose their dream jobs, you see people talk about the \u201cKing\u201d when he\u2019s not there as if he might hear it anyway, you see them bicker and cheat and backstab and prostrate themselves in a way that makes your whole body cringe. It\u2019s fantastic, then, and I will now be watching everything this \u201cLance Oppenheim\u201d child makes from here on in. Thank you for the gift of this documentary, my&nbsp;liege! Very good sir, very good!</p>",

      "bodyText": "A hearty endorsement from me this week, when the lauded-in-the-US-and-only-available-here-after-many-many-months three-parter Ren Faire comes to Sky Documentaries (Friday, 9pm). It is almost impossible to describe this show \u2013 in which a self-appointed \u201cKing\u201d of the US\u2019s longest-running renaissance fayre tries to find the right person to take over before he dies \u2013 without mentioning another HBO show in which an old man who pulses with impenetrable anger and weird horniness chooses someone to take over his job, and I have read a lot of coverage of it that hasn\u2019t even tried. So I\u2019m not going to, either: bit like Succession, isn\u2019t it? Ren Faire focuses on the power struggle beneath George Coulam, the octogenarian self-described visionary who created the Texas Renaissance festival in 1974. The festival only runs for six weeks a year, but in that time welcomes a half-million visitors and turns over millions of dollars. There are jesters and jousts and you can eat turkey drumsticks like they did in olden times. Men in steampunk-style hats say \u201cmy lord!\u201d to you as you walk around and chide you for wearing modern fleeces. I don\u2019t know how this makes millions of dollars either, but it does, and that\u2019s why everyone wants a piece of it. The chief piece-wanters are Jeff Baldwin, the festival\u2019s head of entertainment and an almost disgustingly loyal servant of the king, and Louie Migliaccio, best described as \u201cadult man who likes sugar-free energy drinks\u201d. Jeff wants to maintain the park exactly as George envisioned it, and is not-so-subtly hinting that the best person to do that job is him; Louie wants to run the park as what it is, a business, and is trying to get the bank loans to buy it. George, for what it\u2019s worth, keeps going on sugar-baby dates with mid-20s goths and makes them fill out a survey saying whether they have had breast augmentation surgery or not, and seems ghoulishly drunk on his own mead. There are two notables about Ren Faire, though, that make it so worth your time: the woozy style of it, and the incredible buy-in from the documentary subjects. It\u2019s the second notable work from film-maker Lance Oppenheim, who I am devastated to report is 28 years old, after 2020\u2019s fantastic Some Kind of Heaven (about Florida retirement complex The Villages), and it feels like the arrival of a new and influential visual voice in documentary-making. Shots play with colour and light and lens blur \u2013 where the establishing of the renaissance fayre itself made me write in my notes \u201cwhy don\u2019t we all live like this?\u201d \u2013 and crucially he leans in to the fantasy weirdness of it all, with staged and semi-staged scenes with talking lizards, vision quests, and the subjects acting out their thoughts and feelings without just saying \u201cis this mic on? OK, so \u2013 \u201d in front of a wall. Ren Faire is produced by the Safdie Brothers\u2019 Elara Pictures, and it has the same disconcerting weirdness of last year\u2019s The Curse. There are times when you don\u2019t really know where it ends and the style begins: at one point I had to pause it and do a few searches to ensure this wasn\u2019t, actually, an incredibly clever hyper-observed scripted mockumentary \u2013 and that is something I personally read as \u201cgood and smart\u201d not \u201cannoying, distracting\u201d. This could be a small story in the middle of Texas: instead it turned my sense of reality upside down. Documentary has been hit-and-miss the last few years \u2013 the blockbuster success of Tiger King has made every weirdo think they are one snappy soundbite away from mega-fame, and that has hurt the genre a lot. People act strangely when a camera is on them, then they soften and get used to it, and then \u2013 in the best documentaries, anyway \u2013 they quietly tell you the most devastating or deranged thing you\u2019ve ever heard, all while watering their plants or something. Ren Faire is full of moments like this \u2013 you see people lose their dream jobs, you see people talk about the \u201cKing\u201d when he\u2019s not there as if he might hear it anyway, you see them bicker and cheat and backstab and prostrate themselves in a way that makes your whole body cringe. It\u2019s fantastic, then, and I will now be watching everything this \u201cLance Oppenheim\u201d child makes from here on in. Thank you for the gift of this documentary, my liege! Very good sir, very good!",

As she tries to find out who really killed a man called Frank Parris, the plot thickens when she learns that he had consulted a lawyer about an inheritance. Mark Gatiss and Claire Rushbrook also star. Hollie Richardson Strictly Come Dancing 7.05pm, BBC One There\u2019s no post-Blackpool comedown for the remaining couples as they go straight into the show\u2019s inaugural samba-thon. Judges will eliminate them as they go along (calm down, from the samba, not the whole competition), giving out points before the public have their say. It\u2019s all about the hips and the bounce, so who will triumph? Hannah Verdier Legends of Comedy With Lenny Henry 8.25pm, Channel 4 Sally Phillips\u2019s 30-year comedy career includes Smack the Pony, Alan Partridge and Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary, and she has more recently starred in We Might Regret This. She tells Lenny Henry her biggest influences, from The Goodies and Seinfeld to French and Saunders. HR State of Happiness 9pm, BBC Four For the third season of this Norwegian oil industry drama, the industrial accidents are soundtracked by Simple Minds as the action fast-forwards seven years to 1987. Business is booming, but will everyone get a share of the profits? And who will take over the company? Alexi Duggins Boybands Forever 9.25pm, BBC Two It\u2019s the concluding part of this boyband extravaganza and we\u2019ve reached the 00s \u2013 5ive, Take That and 911 are no more, but four-piece Blue (who were born from a focus group) emerged from the shadows. We then get into the murkier years: the dawn of Simon Cowell and TV talent shows. HR Later \u2026 With Jools Holland 10.30pm, BBC Two With the release of new documentary Pauline Black: A 2-Tone Story, the Selecter\u2019s frontwoman joins Jools for a chat. Elsewhere, St Vincent performs songs from her latest album (awarded the full five stars from this newspaper), plus music from Foals\u2019 Yannis Philippakis, Ghanaian-born singer KOG, Arooj Aftab, Jalen Ngonda and pianist Joe Webb. Ali Catterall Film choice Spellbound, out now, Netflix A very solid first release for former Pixar head honcho John Lasseter\u2019s new animation outfit Skydance, this new CGI fairytale saddles teenage princess Ellian (voiced by Rachel Zegler) with reversing the curse that turned her royal parents into cute monsters (read: giant house pets, voiced by Javier Bardem and Nicole Kidman, both having enormous fun). The animation is stunning, with Maurice Sendak-style critter designs and intricate detail aplenty. And the songs \u2013 such as the samba extravaganza about adventurous eating \u2013 are actually memorable. Rooted in a quest narrative that occasionally dips into a group therapy session, it builds into a surprisingly moving parable about adult responsibility. Phil Hoad Event Horizon, 1.40am, Film4 Directed by the other Paul (WS) Anderson, this sci-fi horror blow-out was a flop on release in 1997, but has deservedly acquired cult status since. Cleaving to the Aliens voyage-into-the-unknown template, Laurence Fishburne leads his crew on a mission to Neptune to salvage a vessel with an experimental warp drive that has ripped a hole in the fabric of reality. Channelling Hellraiser\u2019s Pinhead, you\u2019ve never seen cuddly Sam Neill on such unsettling form as the technological genius becoming one with his creation. It gets a little schlocky, but always retains a disturbing bite. PH Live sport Snooker: UK Championship, 1.15pm, BBC One The afternoon session on day one from the Barbican, York.

      "body": "<p>Hanif Kureishi, Billy Bragg and freedom of speech groups have voiced alarm after a number of venues cancelled events to promote a book by an anti-racism campaigner amid threats and fears that the recent riots have emboldened the far right.</p> <p>An east London bookshop this week became the latest venue to pull plans to promote Rebel Sounds, a book about the role music plays in the fight against racism and other struggles.</p> <p>It follows the scrapping of similar events at bookshops and pubs over the last few weeks, and the <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/10/london-film-festival-far-right-documentary-havana-marking-bfi-hope-not-hate-the-guardian-2024-1236120134/\">cancellation by the BFI London film festival</a> (LFF) last month of a screening of a documentary about the far right.</p> <p>Joe Mulhall, the author of Rebel Sounds and director of research at the anti-racism organisation Hope Not Hate, said: \u201cSadly, it feels like we are going backwards.\u201d</p> <p>Mulhall held an event at a secret location last Sunday night after a pub cancelled what was intended to be an evening of discussion and music about the book.</p> <p>\u201cThe irony wasn\u2019t lost on us that we were having to meet in secret when this is a book about people being forced to do things in a clandestine way in the past in Britain because of the rise of the National Front or other countries because of repressive regimes,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame small independent venues like bookshops and pubs but you would think that the LFF is big enough that they shouldn\u2019t have cancelled. They have the capacity and resources to protect an event if they wanted to.\u201d</p>    <p>Another bookshop that cancelled a few weeks ago after receiving threats has now pulled out of plans to restage the event in December after getting new threats immediately after it was listed online.</p> <p>Threats have been made by email and in phone calls, while extremists from groups angered by Hope Not Hate\u2019s work have been publishing numbers on social media and urging supporters to call.</p> <p>Police were called to a branch of Waterstones in late September when a far-right activist took a seat in the front row and attempted to disrupt the event.</p> <p>The development has shocked artists and veterans of anti-racist campaigns who had believed the days of venues being in fear of the far right had been consigned to the past.</p> <p>But the summer violence \u2013 described by Keir Starmer as far-right riots \u2013 has contributed to a changed atmosphere. It comes after the far right and conspiracy theorists have mobilised aggressive protests against venues hosting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/aug/11/im-just-trying-to-make-the-world-a-little-brighter-how-the-culture-wars-hijacked-drag-queen-story-hour\">shows featuring drag queens</a> reading to young children.</p> <p>Bragg, the socialist singer-songwriter whose own anti-fascist activism through music features in Mulhall\u2019s book, told the Guardian: \u201cThis reminds me of the 1970s and 80s when we had to do solidarity gigs for people.</p> <p>\u201cPeople\u2019s safety is so important but we need to stand up to this kind of thing, which really is a freedom of speech issue and in this case there are threats of violence.\u201d</p> <p>Kureishi, whose fiction has drawn from his own experience of the threat posed to British Asians by the National Front in his youth, said he was shocked to hear about Mulhall\u2019s experience. Another British writer, Guy Gunaratne, said: \u201cThat these readings are now being conducted clandestinely should concern everyone committed to free speech.\u201d</p> <p>Jemimah Steinfeld, the CEO of Index on Censorship, said she was concerned about what appeared to be a \u201cworrying trend\u201d. \u201cIf even an organisation like the BFI is afraid then what hope is there for smaller venues and what message does it send out? You have to put the people working at those places first, but we are also seeing a retreat into safer spaces and it\u2019s something we as a society will regret.\u201d</p> <p>Daniel Gorman, the director of English PEN, said: \u201cEnglish PEN is deeply concerned that threats from the far right have led to venues cancelling planned events with writers and artists. This is part of a worrying trend curtailing the freedom of expression of authors and performers.\u201d</p> <p>Last month the LFF cancelled the screening of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/22/undercover-exposing-the-far-right-review-the-bravest-documentary-of-the-year-so-far\">Undercover: Exposing the Far Right</a>, a documentary that followed Hope Not Hate campaigners. It remains unclear whether the BFI was acting in the face of viable threats.</p> <p>Kristy Matheson, the director of the LFF, said: \u201cI took onboard the expert opinion of colleagues around the safety and wellbeing risks that the screening could have created for audiences and the team and that informed our decision.\u201d</p> <p>The documentary\u2019s director, Havana Marking, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it was taken seriously enough in London at the beginning and then there was a panic. What needs to really happen now is that there is a conversation to ensure this does not happen again.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "Hanif Kureishi, Billy Bragg and freedom of speech groups have voiced alarm after a number of venues cancelled events to promote a book by an anti-racism campaigner amid threats and fears that the recent riots have emboldened the far right. An east London bookshop this week became the latest venue to pull plans to promote Rebel Sounds, a book about the role music plays in the fight against racism and other struggles. It follows the scrapping of similar events at bookshops and pubs over the last few weeks, and the cancellation by the BFI London film festival (LFF) last month of a screening of a documentary about the far right. Joe Mulhall, the author of Rebel Sounds and director of research at the anti-racism organisation Hope Not Hate, said: \u201cSadly, it feels like we are going backwards.\u201d Mulhall held an event at a secret location last Sunday night after a pub cancelled what was intended to be an evening of discussion and music about the book. \u201cThe irony wasn\u2019t lost on us that we were having to meet in secret when this is a book about people being forced to do things in a clandestine way in the past in Britain because of the rise of the National Front or other countries because of repressive regimes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame small independent venues like bookshops and pubs but you would think that the LFF is big enough that they shouldn\u2019t have cancelled. They have the capacity and resources to protect an event if they wanted to.\u201d Another bookshop that cancelled a few weeks ago after receiving threats has now pulled out of plans to restage the event in December after getting new threats immediately after it was listed online. Threats have been made by email and in phone calls, while extremists from groups angered by Hope Not Hate\u2019s work have been publishing numbers on social media and urging supporters to call. Police were called to a branch of Waterstones in late September when a far-right activist took a seat in the front row and attempted to disrupt the event. The development has shocked artists and veterans of anti-racist campaigns who had believed the days of venues being in fear of the far right had been consigned to the past. But the summer violence \u2013 described by Keir Starmer as far-right riots \u2013 has contributed to a changed atmosphere. It comes after the far right and conspiracy theorists have mobilised aggressive protests against venues hosting shows featuring drag queens reading to young children. Bragg, the socialist singer-songwriter whose own anti-fascist activism through music features in Mulhall\u2019s book, told the Guardian: \u201cThis reminds me of the 1970s and 80s when we had to do solidarity gigs for people. \u201cPeople\u2019s safety is so important but we need to stand up to this kind of thing, which really is a freedom of speech issue and in this case there are threats of violence.\u201d Kureishi, whose fiction has drawn from his own experience of the threat posed to British Asians by the National Front in his youth, said he was shocked to hear about Mulhall\u2019s experience. Another British writer, Guy Gunaratne, said: \u201cThat these readings are now being conducted clandestinely should concern everyone committed to free speech.\u201d Jemimah Steinfeld, the CEO of Index on Censorship, said she was concerned about what appeared to be a \u201cworrying trend\u201d. \u201cIf even an organisation like the BFI is afraid then what hope is there for smaller venues and what message does it send out? You have to put the people working at those places first, but we are also seeing a retreat into safer spaces and it\u2019s something we as a society will regret.\u201d Daniel Gorman, the director of English PEN, said: \u201cEnglish PEN is deeply concerned that threats from the far right have led to venues cancelling planned events with writers and artists. This is part of a worrying trend curtailing the freedom of expression of authors and performers.\u201d Last month the LFF cancelled the screening of Undercover: Exposing the Far Right, a documentary that followed Hope Not Hate campaigners. It remains unclear whether the BFI was acting in the face of viable threats. Kristy Matheson, the director of the LFF, said: \u201cI took onboard the expert opinion of colleagues around the safety and wellbeing risks that the screening could have created for audiences and the team and that informed our decision.\u201d The documentary\u2019s director, Havana Marking, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it was taken seriously enough in London at the beginning and then there was a panic. What needs to really happen now is that there is a conversation to ensure this does not happen again.\u201d",

Wait, I\u2019m pretty certain we used to live next door to each other in lockdown. What did you talk about? The odds of being set up by the Guardian with one of your old neighbours. The fact that there is no one new left for us to meet. How supporting Arsenal has brought her closer to her family and community. Most awkward moment? I was told Eva\u2019s mum is concerned that I won\u2019t write words good in my section, so I should proofread it to ensure my prose is nice, and maybe rent a thesaurus to make it a bit more exciting. Good table manners? Seemed great to me, but I\u2019m not a table manners connoisseur. Best thing about Eva? Very funny and very easy to talk to. Would you introduce Eva to your friends? I believe she knows a fair few of my old housemates, but I would happily introduce her to the rest. Describe Eva in three words. Funny, charming and outgoing. What do you think Eva made of you? I hope she enjoyed her evening and her stereotype of mathematics PhDs has been changed. Did you go on somewhere? Up the road to the pub for a pint. And \u2026 did you kiss? No, we didn\u2019t. If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be? I overindulged on the olives. That much sodium can\u2019t be good for me. Marks out of 10? It was a fun evening, so got to be 9. Would you meet again? There was an invitation floated to a house party next week, so there is a decent possibility. Eva on David What were you hoping for? A great meet-cute, or at least a fun evening and some good pasta. First impressions? Disbelief the Guardian had set me up with my old neighbour. Also relieved as I knew we would have a nice evening. What did you talk about? We reminisced about our old road. His PhD, which he explained very well to someone not mathsy. Why I should support Clapton FC instead of Arsenal. Most awkward moment?

He is also a good listener. Would you introduce David to your friends? He already knows lots; they get on well. Describe David in three words. Engaging, intelligent and warm. What do you think David made of you? I hope he was glad this conversation was not over the garden fence. Did you go on somewhere? To look at the Cutty Sark on the Thames as I was embarrassed I\u2019d never seen it, then to a pub nearby. And \u2026 did you kiss? No, we parted ways on the train. If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be? A smoother start \u2013 not having a table wasn\u2019t ideal. Marks out of 10? 8.5. Would you meet again?

      "body": "<p>As countries negotiate over climate finance, Palestinian officials and advocates have come to Cop29 in Baku to highlight global heating\u2019s intersection with another crisis: Israel\u2019s siege on Gaza.</p> <p>\u201cThe Cop [meetings] are very keen to protect the environment, but for whom?\u201d said Ahmed Abu Thaher, director of projects and international relations at Palestine\u2019s Environment Quality Authority, who had travelled to Cop29 from Ramallah. \u201cIf you are killing the people there, for whom are you keen to protect the environment and to minimise the effects of climate change?\u201d</p> <p>Despite the suffering of its people, Palestine was \u201cdoing its homework\u201d on UN climate agreements, Thaher said. Palestine signed the Paris climate agreement and has submitted <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/NDC/2022-06/Updated%20NDC_%20State%20of%20Palestine_2021_FINAL.pdf\">decarbonisation plans</a> to the UN\u2019s climate body.</p> <p>Temperatures in Palestine are <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2023/10/5/interwoven-struggles-the-green-paradox-meets-the-palestine-paradox\">increasing faster</a> than the global average, and it is highly vulnerable to floods, heatwaves, droughts, and storms. But environmental work is complicated because of the ongoing war, Thaher said.</p> <p>Some advocates have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/29/gaza-israel-palestinian-war-ecocide-environmental-destruction-pollution-rome-statute-war-crimes-aoe\">called the crisis</a> in Gaza an \u201cecocide\u201d, saying the war has made its ecosystems unliveable. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in Gaza is completely killing all the elements of life,\u201d said Abeer Butmeh, a coordinator of the Palestinian NGOs Network and Friends of the Earth Palestine who had travelled to Cop29 from the West Bank.</p> <p>The chief prosecutor of the international criminal court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/21/icc-issues-arrest-warrant-for-benjamin-netanyahu-israel\">sought an arrest warrant this week</a> for leaders of Hamas and Israel over actions taken since October 2023. Israeli military forces have killed tens of thousands of people in the region while wreaking havoc on infrastructure and ecosystems.</p> <p>More than 80,000 explosives have been dropped on the area, leaving three-quarters of agricultural land damaged and already exhausted water systems contaminated, Butmeh said. \u201cIt\u2019s a catastrophic situation,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The majority of Gaza\u2019s access to resources has been cut off by Israel, leaving the entire populationof about 2.2 million people with crisis levels of food insecurity, research has <a href=\"https://www.wfp.org/stories/gaza-brink-one-four-people-face-extreme-hunger\">shown</a>. Energy is also scarce. \u201cIsrael controls more than 90% of our energy, so it is not an easy situation,\u201d Thaher said.</p> <p>Without power, wastewater treatment plants have been <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/siege-gazas-water\">forced to shut down</a>, leaving untreated sewage to flood into the streets. When environmentalists including Butmeh tested water from the Gaza Strip, they found dangerous levels of faecal coliforms present, she said.</p> <p>\u201cBy cutting off food, cutting off energy, cutting off water, that means the killing of all people in Gaza,\u201d Butmeh said.</p> <p>For her, the destruction in Gaza is deeply tied to the flow of fossil fuels. She and others have been calling for a fuel embargo on Israel. It is a demand that has featured heavily in protests and press conferences throughout the halls of Cop29. Thaher declined to comment on the protesters\u2019 efforts, saying: \u201cThat is the role of civil society.\u201d</p> <p>A Palestinian organiser and PhD student who asked to remain anonymous told the Guardian: \u201cWe have three main demands. For countries to stop selling energy to Israel, for countries to stop purchasing gas from Israel, and for companies to withdraw from participation in the extraction of gas from illegally occupied Palestinian waters.\u201d</p> <p>On the first point, organisers are asking governments to follow the example of Colombia, which ended coal sales to Israel in June 2024. The country was previously Israel\u2019s largest source of coal imports.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re calling for debilitating them the way they\u2019re debilitating our society,\u201d said Mohammed Usrof, a Gazan research assistant at the Institute for Palestine Studies who is leading a team bringing four Palestinian young negotiators to COP29. Usrof has lost 21 relatives in Gaza since the beginning of the recent onslaught.</p> <p>Other countries have made similar commitments \u2013 Turkey, for instance, said in May it was adopting a total trade ban with Israel. But it has <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-does-turkey-duty-cut-oil-supplies-israel\">reportedly</a> still allowed oil to flow to the country through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline.</p> <p>The anti-fossil fuel advocacy group Oil Change International recently found that 28% of the crude oil supplied to Israel between 21 October 2023 and 12 July 2024 came from Azerbaijan, the nation hosting this year\u2019s UN climate summit. Butmah asked: \u201cIf they\u2019re fuelling the genocide, how can they talk about climate justice?\u201d</p> <p>A particular target for the activists is the energy firm BP, the main operator and largest shareholder of the BTC pipeline. (BTC\u2019s minority partners include TotalEnergies and ExxonMobil.) The company also produces some of the Caspian Sea crude oil delivered by the pipeline to Israel, together with an Azerbaijani national oil company.</p> <p>\u201cBP is one of the largest corporate suppliers of oil to Israel,\u201d said Sadie DeCost, an organiser with the NGO Tipping Point UK.</p> <p>The Guardian has contacted BP, Exxon, Total and the Israeli government for comment.</p> <p>In March, a UN human rights expert said Israel had carried out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/25/israel-gaza-un-rights-expert-arms-embargo-genocide\">acts of genocide</a> in Gaza and should be placed under an arms embargo. The genocide convention of 1948 requires UN parties to employ all reasonably available means to <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/02/arms-exports-israel-must-stop-immediately-un-experts\">prevent genocide</a> in another state as far as possible.</p> <p>A September investigation by the Energy Embargo for Palestine <a href=\"https://shado-mag.com/bp-oil-pipeline-israel-palestine-genocide-investigation/\">campaign</a> indicated that oil transported via the BTC pipeline was refined into jet fuel for warplanes used by the Israel Defense Forces. Salhab argued this meant countries should, under the genocide convention, stop supplying Israel with fuel.</p> <p>A key goal for Cop29 negotiators is to set an expanded goal for climate finance.

      "bodyText": "As countries negotiate over climate finance, Palestinian officials and advocates have come to Cop29 in Baku to highlight global heating\u2019s intersection with another crisis: Israel\u2019s siege on Gaza. \u201cThe Cop [meetings] are very keen to protect the environment, but for whom?\u201d said Ahmed Abu Thaher, director of projects and international relations at Palestine\u2019s Environment Quality Authority, who had travelled to Cop29 from Ramallah. \u201cIf you are killing the people there, for whom are you keen to protect the environment and to minimise the effects of climate change?\u201d Despite the suffering of its people, Palestine was \u201cdoing its homework\u201d on UN climate agreements, Thaher said. Palestine signed the Paris climate agreement and has submitted decarbonisation plans to the UN\u2019s climate body. Temperatures in Palestine are increasing faster than the global average, and it is highly vulnerable to floods, heatwaves, droughts, and storms. But environmental work is complicated because of the ongoing war, Thaher said. Some advocates have called the crisis in Gaza an \u201cecocide\u201d, saying the war has made its ecosystems unliveable. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in Gaza is completely killing all the elements of life,\u201d said Abeer Butmeh, a coordinator of the Palestinian NGOs Network and Friends of the Earth Palestine who had travelled to Cop29 from the West Bank. The chief prosecutor of the international criminal court sought an arrest warrant this week for leaders of Hamas and Israel over actions taken since October 2023. Israeli military forces have killed tens of thousands of people in the region while wreaking havoc on infrastructure and ecosystems. More than 80,000 explosives have been dropped on the area, leaving three-quarters of agricultural land damaged and already exhausted water systems contaminated, Butmeh said. \u201cIt\u2019s a catastrophic situation,\u201d she said. The majority of Gaza\u2019s access to resources has been cut off by Israel, leaving the entire populationof about 2.2 million people with crisis levels of food insecurity, research has shown. Energy is also scarce. \u201cIsrael controls more than 90% of our energy, so it is not an easy situation,\u201d Thaher said. Without power, wastewater treatment plants have been forced to shut down, leaving untreated sewage to flood into the streets. When environmentalists including Butmeh tested water from the Gaza Strip, they found dangerous levels of faecal coliforms present, she said. \u201cBy cutting off food, cutting off energy, cutting off water, that means the killing of all people in Gaza,\u201d Butmeh said. For her, the destruction in Gaza is deeply tied to the flow of fossil fuels. She and others have been calling for a fuel embargo on Israel. It is a demand that has featured heavily in protests and press conferences throughout the halls of Cop29. Thaher declined to comment on the protesters\u2019 efforts, saying: \u201cThat is the role of civil society.\u201d A Palestinian organiser and PhD student who asked to remain anonymous told the Guardian: \u201cWe have three main demands. For countries to stop selling energy to Israel, for countries to stop purchasing gas from Israel, and for companies to withdraw from participation in the extraction of gas from illegally occupied Palestinian waters.\u201d On the first point, organisers are asking governments to follow the example of Colombia, which ended coal sales to Israel in June 2024. The country was previously Israel\u2019s largest source of coal imports. \u201cWe\u2019re calling for debilitating them the way they\u2019re debilitating our society,\u201d said Mohammed Usrof, a Gazan research assistant at the Institute for Palestine Studies who is leading a team bringing four Palestinian young negotiators to COP29. Usrof has lost 21 relatives in Gaza since the beginning of the recent onslaught. Other countries have made similar commitments \u2013 Turkey, for instance, said in May it was adopting a total trade ban with Israel. But it has reportedly still allowed oil to flow to the country through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline. The anti-fossil fuel advocacy group Oil Change International recently found that 28% of the crude oil supplied to Israel between 21 October 2023 and 12 July 2024 came from Azerbaijan, the nation hosting this year\u2019s UN climate summit. Butmah asked: \u201cIf they\u2019re fuelling the genocide, how can they talk about climate justice?\u201d A particular target for the activists is the energy firm BP, the main operator and largest shareholder of the BTC pipeline. (BTC\u2019s minority partners include TotalEnergies and ExxonMobil.) The company also produces some of the Caspian Sea crude oil delivered by the pipeline to Israel, together with an Azerbaijani national oil company. \u201cBP is one of the largest corporate suppliers of oil to Israel,\u201d said Sadie DeCost, an organiser with the NGO Tipping Point UK. The Guardian has contacted BP, Exxon, Total and the Israeli government for comment. In March, a UN human rights expert said Israel had carried out acts of genocide in Gaza and should be placed under an arms embargo. The genocide convention of 1948 requires UN parties to employ all reasonably available means to prevent genocide in another state as far as possible. A September investigation by the Energy Embargo for Palestine campaign indicated that oil transported via the BTC pipeline was refined into jet fuel for warplanes used by the Israel Defense Forces. Salhab argued this meant countries should, under the genocide convention, stop supplying Israel with fuel. A key goal for Cop29 negotiators is to set an expanded goal for climate finance. Activists are concerned about whether Palestine will be able to access those funds. As a member of the UN framework convention on climate change (UFCCC) and a \u201cnon-annex 1\u201d nation, Palestine should be eligible for financial help with the green energy transition and to cope with climate impacts, but it has struggled to access this aid. In some cases, the challenge has been a lack of capacity to complete onerous application processes for climate aid. But in other cases the issues have been \u201ccompletely political\u201d, Thaher said. \u201cWe need reform to make these funds accessible,\u201d he said. Thanks in large part to pressure from the US, reporting military emissions to the UNFCCC, the body that convenes the annual climate talks, is not required. Only a handful of countries report that data to the body on a voluntary basis. But the carbon footprint of conflict is massive. Military conflicts account for about 5.5% of global emissions, one study found. \u201cSince world war two, I have not seen this much [global] conflict,\u201d said Sherry Rehman, Pakistan\u2019s former climate change minister. \u201cThose wars are not being mapped for their carbon footprint and what they\u2019re doing to the world.\u201d The \u201cgross dehumanisation of the victims of war, particularly in Palestine,\u201d has been incomprehensible, Rehman said. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason we say \u2018scorched earth\u2019 for war. From an environmental perspective \u2026 after a war, the Earth is literally scorched.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Vladimir Putin has vowed to launch more strikes using an experimental intermediate-range ballistic missile as Ukraine decried the testing of the nuclear-capable weapon on its territory as an \u201cinternational crime\u201d. Speaking at a defence conference on Friday, Putin contested US claims that Russia possessed only a \u201chandful\u201d of the high-speed ballistic missiles, saying that the military had enough to continue to test them in \u201ccombat conditions\u201d and would put them into serial production. \u201cThe tests [of the missile system] have passed successfully, and I congratulate you all on that,\u201d Putin said, according to the Interfax news agency. \u201cAs has been said already, we\u2019ll be continuing these tests, including in combat conditions, depending on the situation and nature of threats being posed to Russia\u2019s security, especially considering that we have enough of such items, such systems ready for use in stock.\u201d At the same conference, the Russian strategic missile forces commander Sergei Karakayev said that the missiles could strike targets throughout Europe. \u201cDepending on the objectives and the range of this weapon, it can strike targets on the entire territory of Europe, which sets it apart from other types of long-range precision-guided weapons,\u201d Karakayev said. Russia launched the experimental missile, which US officials described as a modified design based on Russia\u2019s longer-range RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile, against a rocket factory in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Both Vladimir Putin and US officials have said the missile is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. US officials have decried Putin\u2019s use of a nuclear-capable warhead but denied that it is a \u201cgamechanger\u201d in the war between Russia and Ukraine, adding that Russia possessed just a handful of the missiles, which its military has named Oreshnik, or Hazel. Volodymyr Zelenskyy called Russia\u2019s use of an experimental ballistic missile in a strike on Ukraine an \u201cinternational crime\u201d as he appealed on Friday to countries around the world including the global south to condemn Russia\u2019s latest escalation. In an address on social media, Zelenskyy said he had already directed his defence minister to hold consultations with allies to secure new air defence systems that could \u201cprotect lives from the new risks\u201d of the intermediate-range missiles. \u201cUsing another country not just for terror but also to test new weapons for terror is clearly an international crime,\u201d the Ukrainian president said. Nato and Ukraine will hold emergency talks on Tuesday to discuss the attack. The conflict is \u201centering a decisive phase\u201d, the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said on Friday, and \u201ctaking on very dramatic dimensions\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s parliament cancelled a session as security was tightened after Thursday\u2019s Russian strike on the military facility in Dnipro. Aside from western partners, Zelenskyy called on China and members of the global south, to condemn the strike, saying that the leaders \u201ccall for restraint every time, and in response they invariably receive some new escalation from Moscow\u201d. China and Brazil have proposed a joint \u201cpeace plan\u201d that Ukraine has said only emboldens Russia by providing diplomatic cover for the continued assault on Ukraine.",

      "bodyText": "Investor Scott Bessent has been nominated by Donald Trump to serve as treasury secretary. The billionaire hedge-fund manager has spent his career in finance and the nomination for this post has been one of the most anticipated in recent days. Here are five things to know about the person who could have vast influence over economic, regulatory and international affairs. His finance career Bessent, 62, from South Carolina, has spent his career in finance, working for macro investment billionaire George Soros and noted short-seller Jim Chanos, as well as running his own hedge fund. As a money manager, he made a large bet on Trump winning after spotting what he called an anomaly in the market \u2013 that political and market analysts were too negative on what a Trump victory would mean. The market\u2019s surge after Trump\u2019s election victory, he wrote, signaled investor expectations of \u201chigher growth, lower volatility and inflation, and a revitalized economy for all Americans\u201d. He\u2019s \u2018all in\u2019 for Trump Bessent, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment, has advocated for tax reform and deregulation, particularly to spur more bank lending and energy production, as noted in a recent opinion piece he wrote for the Wall Street Journal. He has called for rolling back government subsidies, deregulating the economy and raising domestic energy production. Unlike many on Wall Street, Bessent has also defended the use of tariffs, which are Trump\u2019s favorite economic tool. \u201cI was all in for President Trump. I was one of the few Wall Street people backing him,\u201d Bessent told Trump ally Roger Stone over the weekend. \u201cBessent has been on the side of less aggressive tariffs,\u201d said Oxford Economics\u2019 Ryan Sweet, adding that picking him makes the steep tariffs Trump proposed on the campaign trail less likely. He\u2019s one of a few Bessent will take his investing knowledge down a rarefied career path that only a few other prominent Wall Street luminaries have followed: running the US Treasury. Bessent follows other financial luminaries who have taken the job, including former Goldman Sachs executives Robert Rubin, Hank Paulson and Steven Mnuchin, Trump\u2019s first treasury chief. Janet Yellen, the current secretary and first woman in the job, previously chaired the Federal Reserve and White House Council of Economic Advisers. A twisty race to the top Bessent, along with John Paulson, had been a favorite for the job earlier in the year, according to a Reuters report at the time. He seemed to be in pole position a week after election day, on 12 November, when Paulson exited the race citing \u201ccomplex financial obligations\u201d. However, there were many twists in the race for the top position. On 13 November, banker Howard Lutnick, who was leading a transition team to vet personnel and draft policy, emerged as a top contender. Lutnick was reported to have directly lobbied for the treasury post, even receiving the backing of Trump ally Elon Musk. However, Trump instead picked Lutnick, one of his biggest fundraisers, to lead his trade and tariff strategy as head of the commerce department. The pool of candidates then widened when Marc Rowan, Apollo Global Management co-founder, and former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh were under consideration, as was the Republican US senator Bill Hagerty, sources with knowledge of the transition process said at the time. The choice came after days of deliberations by Trump as he sorted through a shifting list of candidates. Bessent spent day after day at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago home in Florida providing economic advice, sources said, a proximity to the president-elect that may have helped him prevail. In charge of the world\u2019s largest economy As treasury secretary, Bessent will essentially be the highest-ranking US economic official, responsible for maintaining the balance of the world\u2019s largest economy, from collecting taxes and paying the nation\u2019s bills to managing the $28.6tn treasury debt market and overseeing financial regulation, including handling and preventing market crises. The treasury boss also runs US financial sanctions policy, has influence over the IMF, the World Bank and other international financial institutions, and manages national security screenings of foreign investments in the United States. Bessent will face challenges, including safely managing federal deficits that are forecast to grow by nearly $8tn over a decade due to Trump\u2019s plans to extend expiring tax cuts next year and add generous new breaks, including ending taxes on social security income. Without offsetting revenues, this new debt would add to an unsustainable fiscal trajectory already forecast to balloon US debt by $22tn through 2033. Managing debt increases this large without market indigestion will be a challenge, though Bessent has argued Trump\u2019s agenda will unleash stronger economic growth that will grow revenue and shore up market confidence.",

Makary also raised concerns about a number of public health issues during the Covid pandemic, touting the protection from natural immunity and opposing Covid vaccine mandates.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Donald Trump nominated hedge fund executive Scott Bessent to lead the US treasury.</strong> In a statement on Friday Trump said, \u201cScott has long been a strong advocate of the America First Agenda \u2026 he will help me usher in a new Golden Age for the United States, as we fortify our position as the World\u2019s leading Economy \u2026 while always, and without question, maintaining the UD Dollar as the Reserve Currency of the World.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Vivek Ramaswamy</strong> <strong>appeared to confirm he and Elon Musk will try to stop the flow of funds that go to Planned Parenthood.</strong> \u201cThe federal government shouldn\u2019t be in the business of giving away free money to non-governmental organizations. That should be obvious,\u201d a Thursday post on X by Ramaswamy read.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Tom Homan, Donald Trump\u2019s pick for \u201cborder czar\u201d, sent a message</strong> specifically to the Los Angeles city council: \u201cIf you don\u2019t help, get the hell out of the way,\u201d Homan said on Newsmax on Wednesday.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Donald Trump has been granted permission by the New York </strong><strong>Judge Juan Merchan on Friday to seek dismissal of his hush money criminal case. </strong>The permission follows his presidential victory on 5 November and multiple sentencing delays surrounding the case of which he was found guilty earlier this year.</p></li> <li><p><strong>After resigning from congress and withdrawing from consideration to be the next US attorney general, Matt Gaetz is taking his talents to Cameo</strong>, an app that lets users pay for personalized video messages from celebrities and other notable figures like Gaetz and George Santos.

While there is currently no special envoy dedicated solely to resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Trump is considering creating the role, according to the four sources Reuters spoke to, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.</p> <p>Trump vowed on the campaign trail to swiftly end the conflict, although he has not said how he will do it. His strategies will continue to be questioned if Grenell is confirmed since some of his stances could give Ukraine\u2019s leaders pause.</p> <p>During a Bloomberg roundtable in July, Grenell advocated for the creation of \u201cautonomous zones\u201d as a means of settling the conflict, which began after Russia invaded Ukrainian sovereign territory. He also suggested he would not be in favor of Ukraine joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the immediate future, a position he shares with many Trump allies.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-23T01:49:24.323Z\">at 1.49am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-67412d7f8f08849211a42ead\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-23T01:26:58.210Z\">1.26am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">NFL veteran Scott Turner picked to lead housing and urban development</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Donald Trump said on Friday he has picked NFL veteran <strong>Scott Turner</strong> to serve as housing and urban development secretary.

      "bodyText": "Thank you for reading along with the Guardian\u2019s liveblog as we cover the slew of nominations to various cabinet positions that Trump announced today. Here are some of the key moments from the day in US politics. Trump\u2019s choice to lead the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is surgeon Marty Makary. He has advocated for re-examining the use of hormone replacement treatment in menopausal women, reducing overuse of antibiotics and reforms to medical education. Makary also raised concerns about a number of public health issues during the Covid pandemic, touting the protection from natural immunity and opposing Covid vaccine mandates. Donald Trump nominated hedge fund executive Scott Bessent to lead the US treasury. In a statement on Friday Trump said, \u201cScott has long been a strong advocate of the America First Agenda \u2026 he will help me usher in a new Golden Age for the United States, as we fortify our position as the World\u2019s leading Economy \u2026 while always, and without question, maintaining the UD Dollar as the Reserve Currency of the World. Vivek Ramaswamy appeared to confirm he and Elon Musk will try to stop the flow of funds that go to Planned Parenthood. \u201cThe federal government shouldn\u2019t be in the business of giving away free money to non-governmental organizations. That should be obvious,\u201d a Thursday post on X by Ramaswamy read. Tom Homan, Donald Trump\u2019s pick for \u201cborder czar\u201d, sent a message specifically to the Los Angeles city council: \u201cIf you don\u2019t help, get the hell out of the way,\u201d Homan said on Newsmax on Wednesday. Donald Trump has been granted permission by the New York Judge Juan Merchan on Friday to seek dismissal of his hush money criminal case. The permission follows his presidential victory on 5 November and multiple sentencing delays surrounding the case of which he was found guilty earlier this year. After resigning from congress and withdrawing from consideration to be the next US attorney general, Matt Gaetz is taking his talents to Cameo, an app that lets users pay for personalized video messages from celebrities and other notable figures like Gaetz and George Santos. The news website Semafor first reported the move on Friday. Donald Trump is considering tapping Richard Grenell, his former intelligence chief, to be a special envoy for the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Reuters reports. While there is currently no special envoy dedicated solely to resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Trump is considering creating the role, according to the four sources Reuters spoke to, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to swiftly end the conflict, although he has not said how he will do it. His strategies will continue to be questioned if Grenell is confirmed since some of his stances could give Ukraine\u2019s leaders pause. During a Bloomberg roundtable in July, Grenell advocated for the creation of \u201cautonomous zones\u201d as a means of settling the conflict, which began after Russia invaded Ukrainian sovereign territory. He also suggested he would not be in favor of Ukraine joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the immediate future, a position he shares with many Trump allies. Donald Trump said on Friday he has picked NFL veteran Scott Turner to serve as housing and urban development secretary. This will be the athlete and motivational speaker\u2019s second time as a member of the Trump administration; he first served as the executive director of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council. Turner, a Republican, has been involved in politics for more than a decade. After playing for the team now known as the Washington Commanders (Trump used the team\u2019s old name in his statement), Turner made a failed bid for Congress in California before being elected to the Texas House in 2012, the Texas Tribune reported. Trump\u2019s choice to lead the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is surgeon Marty Makary. The FDA is the world\u2019s most influential drug regulator with a more than $7bn budget. It is responsible for approving new treatments and ensuring they are safe and effective before entering the biggest and most lucrative market. It has regulatory authority over human and veterinary drugs, biological medicines, medical devices and vaccines. The agency is also responsible for maintaining safety standards for the food supply, tobacco, cosmetics and products that emit radiation. Makary\u2019s most recent book, Blind Spots, was published in September. In interviews promoting the book, he spoke against what he called \u201cmassive overtreatment\u201d in the US that he called \u201can epidemic of inappropriate care\u201d. He has advocated for re-examining the use of hormone replacement treatment in menopausal women, reducing overuse of antibiotics and reforms to medical education. Makary also raised concerns about a number of public health issues during the Covid pandemic, touting the protection from natural immunity and opposing Covid vaccine mandates. Dave Weldon has been a doctor for 40 years, served in the US army and had stints on House subcommittees dealing with issues related to the CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including enacting a ban on patents for human embryos. Trump said in a statement: \u201cThe current Health of Americans is critical, and CDC will play a big role in helping to ensure Americans have the tools and resources they need to understand the underlying causes of disease, and the solutions to cure these diseases. \u201cAs a father of two and a husband of 45 years, Dave understands American Family Values, and views Health as one of utmost importance. Dave will prioritize Transparency, Competence, and High Standards at CDC. Dave will proudly restore the CDC to its true purpose, and will work to end the Chronic Disease Epidemic, and Make America Healthy Again!\u201d Donald Trump has announced Dave Weldon as his choice to serve as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, a sweeping US agency with a $17.3bn budget used as a public health model around the world. Weldon, 71, is a medical doctor and former lawmaker who served in the US House of Representatives, representing Florida. Sebastian Gorka, the controversial adviser from Trump\u2019s first term, is making a return to the White House \u2013 after Trump has named him as deputy assistant to the president and senior director for counterterrorism. Gorka \u2013 a former Breitbart writer and longtime rightwing Maga supporter \u2013 was let go from the White House in 2017. Now Trump has decided to give him a job in his new administration and praised what he called Gorka\u2019s \u201cmore than 30 years of national security experience\u201d. Born in the UK to Hungarian-born parents, Gorka spent much of his career in the Hungarian ministry of defense working on issues of counter-terrorism. Since he became a fixture of the Trump campaign and administration, numerous experts have raised questions about his formal credentials and his work in the field of counter-terrorism, and noted his connections to the \u201calt-right\u201d in the US and fringe rightwing groups in Hungary. Donald Trump has chosen former state department official Alex Wong to serve as deputy national security adviser. Wong, who served as deputy special representative for North Korea during the first Trump administration, \u201chelped negotiate my Summit with North Korean Leader, Kim Jong Un\u201d, Trump said in a statement. We\u2019re not yet done with job announcements. Amid the Friday night flurry, Trump has also named his pick for surgeon general \u2013 Dr Janette Nesheiwat. Nesheiwat is a double board-certified medical doctor, a regular Fox News contributor and the author of Beyond the Stethoscope: Miracles in Medicine. In a statement, Trump described her as a \u201cfierce advocate\u201d for preventive medicine and public health. He added: \u201cHer expertise and leadership have been pivotal during some of the most challenging Healthcare crises of our time. \u201cDr Janette provided on-the-ground medical treatment to Americans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the Joplin tornadoes. She is also a member of Samaritan\u2019s Purse Disaster Assistance, Relief Team, and has provided lifesaving care during crises in Morocco, Haiti, and Poland.\u201d Donald Trump has picked Lori Chavez-DeRemer as labor secretary. Chavez-DeRemer lost her Oregon congressional seat to Democrat Janelle Bynum in the 2024 election. Chavez-DeRemer had narrowly won the seat in 2022, which was the first election held in the district after its boundaries were significantly redrawn following the 2020 census. Announcing Chavez-DeRemer on Friday night, Trump wrote in a social media post: I look forward to working with her to create tremendous opportunity for American Workers, to expand Training and Apprenticeships, to grow wages and improve working conditions, to bring back our Manufacturing jobs \u2026 \u201cLori\u2019s strong support from both the Business and Labor communities will ensure that the Labor Department can unite Americans of all backgrounds. Labor secretary is a post that needs Senate confirmation. Donald Trump has praised Russ Vought as a \u201ccost cutter\u201d in a statement after nominating him for the OMB. The president-elect wrote on Truth Social: \u201cHe did an excellent job serving in this role in my First Term - We cut four Regulations for every new Regulation, and it was a Great Success!\u201d Trump went on to say Vought is \u201can aggressive cost cutter and deregulator who will help us implement our America First Agenda across all Agencies\u201d. Donald Trump has chosen Russ Vought, a key architect of Project 2025, as his choice for director of the Office of Management and Budget, a powerful agency that helps decide the president\u2019s policy priorities and how to pay for them. Reuters reports that Vought, who was OMB chief during Trump\u2019s 2017-2021 term, would play a major role in setting budget priorities and implementing Trump\u2019s campaign promise to roll back government regulations. Here\u2019s more on Vought from Reuters: Since Trump left office, Vought has been deeply involved in Project 2025, a series of detailed policy proposals for Trump\u2019s second term drawn up by hundreds of high-profile conservatives. Among other measures, Project 2025 calls for a broad expansion in presidential power by boosting the number of political appointees and increasing the president\u2019s authority over the justice department. The project also proposes enforcing laws that make it illegal to mail abortion pills over state lines, criminalizing pornography and eliminating the Department of Education. The project\u2019s authors, Vought included, have also advocated for the reclassification of parts of the federal workforce that would give Trump the authority to fire tens of thousands of government employees. During his election campaign, Trump repeatedly denied he had any links to Project 2025, even though many of its authors were former officials from his first administration. With Vought\u2019s selection, the president-elect has now tapped several former aides with Project 2025 links for key administration roles. In a statement on Friday, Donald Trump said: Scott has long been a strong advocate of the America First Agenda \u2026 he will help me usher in a new Golden Age for the United States, as we fortify our position as the World\u2019s leading Economy \u2026 while always, and without question, maintaining the UD Dollar as the Reserve Currency of the World. As a lifelong Champion of Main Street America and American Industry, Scott will support my Policies that will drive US Competitiveness, and stop unfair Trade imbalances, work to create an Economy that places Growth at the forefront, especially through our coming World Energy Dominance. Here is some more on Scott Bessent, Donald Trump\u2019s projected pick to lead the US treasury, from Reuters: Bessent has advocated for tax reform and deregulation, particularly to spur more bank lending and energy production, as noted in a recent opinion piece he wrote for The Wall Street Journal. The market\u2019s surge after Trump\u2019s election victory, he wrote, signaled investor \u201cexpectations of higher growth, lower volatility and inflation, and a revitalized economy for all Americans. Bessent follows other financial luminaries who have taken the job, including former Goldman Sachs executives Robert Rubin, Hank Paulson and Steven Mnuchin, Trump\u2019s first Treasury chief. Janet Yellen, the current secretary and first woman in the job. While Bessent\u2019s nomination is not official, he appears to have risen to the top of Trump\u2019s short list of treasury heads, a position that is being closely watched by Wall Street. After resigning from congress and withdrawing from consideration to be the next US attorney general, Matt Gaetz is taking his talents to Cameo, an app that lets users pay for personalized video messages from celebrities and other notable figures like Gaetz and George Santos. The news website Semafor first reported the move on Friday. As my colleague Martin Pengelly reports: On Friday, Gaetz began by charging $250 a video but soon raised that price to $500\u2026Other disgraced political figures who have turned to Cameo include Rod Blagojevich, the former Illinois governor who was jailed for trying to sell Barack Obama\u2019s US Senate seat, a sentence commuted by Trump, and Rudy Giuliani, the New York mayor turned Trump attorney now facing financial and legal ruin. Read more from Martin here. Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet is continuing to take shape with the expected nomination of Scott Bessent to lead the US treasury, reports from Bloomberg, the Washington Post and other outlets say. Bessent runs the hedge fund Key square group and was an economic adviser to Trump during his campaign. If Bessent, 62, is confirmed, he will be assuming the role of the nation\u2019s highest-ranking economic policy official and will be tasked with bringing to life Trump\u2019s economic promises like extending his 2017 tax cuts. The announcement is still not final but all signs are pointing to Bessent over other options that were floated like Apollo global management inc. executive Marc Rowan, former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh and Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty. Donald Trump plans to fire the team of prosecutors who helped Jack Smith, the special counsel to the US department of justice, bring two federal cases against Trump for his alleged interference in the 2020 election, the Washington Post reports. Smith announced his plan to resign and end his two-year-long prosecution of Trump before the president-elect takes office on 13 November. In 2023, Smith indicted Trump for allegedly plotting to overturn his 2020 election defeat, and for conspiring to hide classified documents. Neither case made it to trial before Trump\u2019s election victory last week, making it virtually impossible for Smith to continue his investigation. Justice department policy prohibits the prosecution of sitting presidents, and Trump has vowed to fire Smith within \u201ctwo seconds\u201d of becoming president again. Now Trump is turning attention to the mid- and upper-level prosecutors who assisted Smith, calling them \u201cSleazeBags\u201d and \u201cderanged\u201d in social media posts. Read the rest of the Post\u2019s reporting on how Trump plans to go after these attorneys here. A niche law from 1907 that made it illegal to cheat on your spouse in the state of New York has been repealed, the Associated Press reports. The misdemeanor once could have landed adulterers in jail for three months. Kathy Hochul signed a bill on Friday repealing the statute. The New York governor said it was \u201csilly\u201d for the state to have such a rule in place. Adultery bans are law in several states, though charges are rare and convictions even rarer. Some states have also moved to repeal their adultery laws in recent years. When asked for his response to cities refusing to assist in deportations, Tom Homan, Donald Trump\u2019s pick for \u201cborder czar\u201d, sent a message specifically to the Los Angeles city council: \u201cIf you don\u2019t help, get the hell out of the way,\u201d Homan said on Newsmax on Wednesday. \u201cIf I gotta send twice as many officers to LA because we\u2019re not getting any assistance, then that\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do,\u201d Homan continued. The comments came hours after the LA city council unanimously voted to pass a \u201csanctuary city\u201d ordinance that blocks any city resources or personnel from being used to assist in enforcing federal immigration laws. The policy was introduced in 2023 but passed as the next Trump administration takes shape. And while the ordinance does not prevent deportations and other government actions from happening on LA\u2019s soil, it\u2019s meant to \u201cbuild a firewall between federal immigration enforcement and city agencies,\u201d the LA Times reports. Vivek Ramaswamy appeared to confirm he and Elon Musk will try to stop the flow of funds that go to Planned Parenthood. \u201cThe federal government shouldn\u2019t be in the business of giving away free money to non-governmental organizations. That should be obvious,\u201d a Thursday post on X by Ramaswamy read. The post was a quoted reposting of a story from LifeNews, an anti-abortion digital news site, that bore the headline Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy Call for Defunding Planned Parenthood Via DOGE. The pair will lead what they plan to call the \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d and have made prior comments about defunding organizations like the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Education, Forbes reported. Read more of the Guardian\u2019s coverage about the concerted efforts to topple Planned Parenthood and deliver blows to women\u2019s healthcare here. Dick Durbin, the US Senate majority whip, has released a statement on Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Pam Bondi as the next attorney general, calling for the Senate judiciary committee to follow convention rules on customary FBI background checks. Durbin said: Serious questions have been raised about Ms Bondi\u2019s conduct as Florida\u2019s Attorney General and President-elect Trump\u2019s personal attorney. The Trump transition team is moving forward with an Attorney General nominee without the customary FBI background check. After the controversial announcement and awkward withdrawal of Matt Gaetz, the Senate and the Senate Judiciary Committee should insist that President-elect Trump, like prior Presidents-elect of both parties, follow the rules. The Committee must uphold its constitutional responsibility of advice and consent on this critical position. Here\u2019s a look at where things stand: Donald Trump has been granted permission by the New York Judge Juan Merchan on Friday to seek dismissal of his hush money criminal case. The permission follows his presidential victory on 5 November and multiple sentencing delays surrounding the case of which he was found guilty earlier this year. In a statement filled with multiple falsehoods, the Donald Trump campaign hailed Merchan\u2019s decision to grant Trump permission to seek dismissal of his hush money criminal case. Calling the decision a \u201cdecisive win\u201d, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung falsely claimed the case \u2013 which found Trump guilty on 34 felony counts of falsified business records \u2013 was a \u201choax.\u201d Donald Trump is expected to offer Kelly Loeffler, the former Georgia Republican senator, the position of agriculture secretary, CNN reports. According to people familiar with the matter who spoke to the outlet, Trump is set to meet with Loeffler at Mar-a-Lago on Friday afternoon. Melania Trump\u2019s office has appointed Haley Harrison, a longtime aid, as her new chief of staff ahead of her husband Donald Trump\u2019s second term in the White House. In a statement on Friday, Trump\u2019s office said: \u201cShe has a strong understanding of White House operations, and as Chief of Staff, Mrs. Harrison will oversee and manage the East Wing\u2019s team.\u201d In a new interview on Friday, Matt Gaetz revealed that he will not be returning to Congress next year. Speaking to conservative talk show host Charlie Kirk, Gaetz, who withdrew his attorney general nomination yesterday, said: \u201cI\u2019m still going to be in the fight, but it\u2019s going to be from a new perch. I do not intend to join the 119th Congress,\u201d CNN reports. More than half of Americans, 53%, approve of Donald Trump\u2019s plans and policies for his second presidential term, a new Pew Research survey has found. The survey, which was conducted between November 12 and 17 and among 9,609 adults, also found that 59% of Americans said they are very or somewhat confident in Trump to make good decisions about economic policy. Pam Bondi, a staunch Donald Trump loyalist and his pick to be attorney general, is continuing to receive support from Republicans on her nomination. In a post on X, senator John Cornyn of Texas wrote: \u201cAn excellent nomination by Donald Trump for attorney general.\u201d Missouri senator Josh Hawley said Bondi will \u201cbe a fabulous AG\u201d who will \u201cbe a fantastic partner in this effort to clean up the FBI and DOJ.\u201d Similarly, senator Mitt Romney said Bondi \u201cwill be a highly capable leader at DOJ.\u201d Melania Trump\u2019s office has appointed Haley Harrison, a longtime aid, as her new chief of staff ahead of her husband Donald Trump\u2019s second term in the White House. In a statement on Friday, Trump\u2019s office said: Mrs. Harrison has maintained an integral role and exceptional leadership on the First Lady\u2019s team over the past seven years. She has a strong understanding of White House operations, and as Chief of Staff, Mrs. Harrison will oversee and manage the East Wing\u2019s team while strategically liaising with other parts of government. Donald Trump is expected to offer Kelly Loeffler, the former Georgia Republican senator, the position of agriculture secretary, CNN and The Hill report. According to people familiar with the matter who spoke to the outlet, Trump is set to meet with Loeffler at Mar-a-Lago on Friday afternoon. Loeffler, who is co-chairing Trump\u2019s inauguration events, was previously appointed to the Senate by Georgia\u2019s governor Brian Kemp and then lost in 2021 to Raphael Warnock, the Democratic senator. Karl Rove, a Republican strategist, has rebuked Donald Trump for bringing \u201cchaos\u201d back. Martin Pengelly reports for the Guardian: As Matt Gaetz, Donald Trump\u2019s first nominee for attorney general, withdrew after eight days amid allegations of sexual misconduct and more, and as Trump\u2019s new pick, Pam Bondi, faced scrutiny of her own, a leading Republican strategist rebuked the president-elect for bringing \u201cchaos\u201d back to Washington. \u201cInadequate vetting, impatience, disregard for qualifications and a thirst for revenge have created chaos and controversy for Mr Trump before he\u2019s even in office,\u201d said Karl Rove, once known as George W Bush\u2019s \u201cBrain\u201d, in the Wall Street Journal. \u201cThe price for all this will be missed opportunities to shore up popular support for the incoming president. But at least it\u2019ll make great TV.\u201d For the full story, click here: In a statement filled with multiple falsehoods, the Donald Trump campaign hailed New York judge Juan Merchan\u2019s decision to grant Trump permission to seek dismissal of his hush money criminal case. Calling the decision a \u201cdecisive win,\u201d Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung falsely claimed the case \u2013 which found Trump guilty on 34 felony counts of falsified business records \u2013 was a \u201choax.\u201d Repeating Trump\u2019s unfounded claim that he \u201cwon a landslide victory,\u201d Cheung added that the \u201cAmerican people have issued a mandate to return him to office and dispose of all remnants of the witch hunt cases\u201d \u2013 another unfounded claim propelled by Trump in his attacks against his political enemies. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Republican representative, is reportedly set to lead a new House subcommittee that will work with the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, a government body that Trump claims he\u2019ll create, to be led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, according to CNBC. A source familiar with the situation told the network that Greene, along with James Comer, the Republican House oversight chairman, have already met with Ramaswamy and his team, and they are \u201calready working together\u201d. In a statement to CNBC, Greene said she was \u201cexcited to chair this new subcommittee designed to work hand in hand with President Trump, Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and the entire DOGE team\u201d. Republican Derek Merrin has officially conceded the race for Ohio\u2019s ninth congressional district to his Democratic opponent and veteran congresswoman, Marcy Kaptur. In a video statement posted to X, Merrin said that he had called and congratulated Kaptur for winning two more years in Congress. \u201cI want to thank each and every person who supported our campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cWe ran a strong race and I\u2019m proud of the effort we made for NW Ohio.\u201d Merrin, a fourth-term state representative who was endorsed by the president-elect, Donald Trump, lost by about 2,300 votes \u2013 or 0.7% of the vote \u2013 according to the Associated Press. \u201cGuys, they spent over $10m against us\u201d Merrin said in the video. \u201cDemocrats propped up a third party candidate to siphon votes from us, they hit us hard for almost 100 days in the media, and, that\u2019s life, man, that\u2019s politics.\u201d He continued: \u201cWe were fortunate enough to have the money to get our message out, and outside groups were able to talk about Marcy\u2019s record, and it was mainly a fair fight that way \u2013 and Marcy Kaptur got more votes than we did, and I accept that.\u201d Merrin did not rule out the possibility of running for Kaptur\u2019s seat again in the future, but stated that his immediate plans are to rest and recharge with his family. \u201cWe stood up for our constitution, we fought for lower taxes, fiscal responsibility, set a vision out for more prosperity in northwest Ohio and we weren\u2019t able to win,\u201d Merrin said, \u201cbut our message and team across America won.\u201d Chuck Grassley, the incoming Senate judiciary chair, praised Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, Pam Bondi, in a statement. \u201cPam Bondi is a longtime prosecutor &amp; effectively led FL large AttyGeneral\u2019s office for 8yrs\u201d wrote Grassley, the Republican senator from Iowa and the oldest member of the senate at 91 years old. He went on to describe Bondi as \u201cwell regarded\u201d and \u201cexperienced\u201d noting that he got to know her during Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cWill learn more as we vet her nom in judic Cmte\u201d he added. There are several actions Joe Biden can take to protect civil liberties before Donald Trump takes the White House. The Guardian\u2019s Gloria Oladipo reports: In less than two months, Donald Trump will take office, threatening several areas of American life and international policy. The president-elect has pledged to take aim at LGBTQ+ rights, specifically for transgender and gender-non-conforming people. He has promised to conduct mass deportations and raids as a part of a far-right approach to US immigration. And he is expected to roll back data collection practices on police misconduct and stifle any hope of passing police reform in Congress \u2013 specifically the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Trump will largely be able to roll out his agenda, outlined in the 900-plus-page Project 2025 document, as Republicans took control of Congress during the 2024 general election. Joe Biden\u2019s actions in his remaining time in office could be a crucial buttress against the expected impacts of the next four years. Six experts spoke with the Guardian about what the US president could do in his remaining time to protect the most vulnerable people. For the full story, click here: In a new interview on Friday, Matt Gaetz revealed that he will not be returning to Congress next year. Speaking to conservative talk show host Charlie Kirk, Gaetz, who withdrew his attorney general nomination yesterday, said: \u201cI\u2019m still going to be in the fight, but it\u2019s going to be from a new perch. I do not intend to join the 119th Congress,\u201d CNN reports. The former Florida representative went on to add: \u201cThere are a number of fantastic Floridians who\u2019ve stepped up to run for my seat, people who have inspired with their heroism, with their public service. And I\u2019m actually excited to see northwest Florida go to new heights and have great representation\u2026 I\u2019m going to be fighting for President Trump. I\u2019m going to be doing whatever he asks of me, as I always have. But I think that eight years is probably enough time in the United States Congress.\u201d Gaetz was elected in 2016 and served up until two weeks ago when he resigned following his nomination by Donald Trump to serve as attorney general. However, swamped by public scrutiny over his sexual assault allegations and a House ethics committee investigation into the claims, Gaetz retracted his name this week. In a statement about his nomination withdrawal, Gaetz said: \u201cWhile the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition.\u201d With New York judge Juan Merchan indefinitely postponing Donald Trump\u2019s criminal hush money case, attorneys on both sides are debating over its future. Victoria Bekiempis reports for the Guardian: Trump\u2019s lawyers on Tuesday asked Merchan to throw out the case, contending that dismissal was necessary \u201cin order to facilitate the orderly transition of executive power\u201d. Todd Blanche, Trump\u2019s lead attorney and choice for deputy US attorney general, and Emil Bove, the president-elect\u2019s pick for principal associate deputy attorney general, complained that Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s team \u201cappears to not yet be ready to dismiss this politically motivated and fatally flawed case, which is what is mandated by the law and will happen as justice takes its course\u201d\u2026 Prosecutors disagreed that Trump\u2019s case should be dismissed simply because appeals wouldn\u2019t be decided before his inauguration. While they respected the presidency and understood the logistical issues, \u201cno current law establishes that a president\u2019s temporary immunity from prosecution requires dismissal of a post-trial criminal proceeding that was initiated at a time when the defendant was not immune from criminal prosecution, and that is based on unofficial conduct from which the defendant is also not immune.\u201d For the full story, click here: In a brief court decision issued on Friday, New York judge Juan Merchan wrote: \u201cIt is hereby ordered, that defendant\u2019s request for leave to file a motion to dismiss\u2026is granted.\u201d With Donald Trump set to return to the White House in two months, no new sentencing date in his hush money case has been given. Merchan has asked Trump\u2019s lawyers to file a formal motion for dismissal by December 2 and for Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg to respond by December 9. Trump was originally scheduled to be sentence on November 26. However, Bragg\u2019s office asked Merchan to consider suspending the proceedings during Trump\u2019s presidency and instead issue a sentencing once he has completed his four-year term and is no longer in office. Donald Trump has been granted permission by a New York judge on Friday to seek dismissal of his hush money criminal case. The permission follows his presidential victory on November 5 and multiple sentencing delays surrounding the case of which he was found guilty earlier this year. More than half of Americans, 53%, approve of Donald Trump\u2019s plans and policies for his second presidential term, a new Pew Research survey has found. The survey, which was conducted between November 12 and 17 and among 9,609 adults, also found that 59% of Americans said they are very or somewhat confident in Trump to make good decisions about economic policy. 54% of Americans expressed confidence in his stance on law enforcement and criminal justice, 53% each on immigration and foreign policy, 45% on his abortion policies and 41% on his ability to unite the country. Meanwhile, more Democrats are pessimistic about the future of their party than in any other year, with 49% of Democrats and Democratic leaners feeling that way. 43% of Americans said they believe the Democratic party represents them at least somewhat well. On the other hand, 86% of Republicans and Republican leaners say they are optimistic about the GOP\u2019s future, with 50% of Americans saying the GOP represents them at least somewhat well. A handful of other Republicans from Florida are celebrating Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Pam Bondi as attorney general. The state\u2019s current attorney general Ashley Moody took to X and wrote, \u201cCongratulations to my friend, Pam Bondi. Pam will be an excellent US attorney general.\u201d Daniel Webster, a House representative serving the state\u2019s 11th congressional district called Bondi\u2019s nomination a \u201cgood pick.\u201d Meanwhile, the state\u2019s chief financial officer Jimmy Patronis wrote: \u201cI\u2019m so happy for my dear friend Pam Bondi to be selected as our next US attorney general by@realDonaldTrump. She\u2019s an incredible legal talent who served Florida well and also did great work defending the President when the Left was coming after him for Russia, Russia, Russia!\u201d Florida\u2019s Republican representative Carlos Gimenez is hailing Pam Bondi\u2019s nomination as attorney general, writing on X: \u201cPresident Trump has put our sunshine state at the heart of his administration &amp; we are all so proud! President: Florida Secretary of State: Florida Attorney General: Florida Chief of Staff: Florida National Security Advisor: Florida.\u201d Bondi previously served as the state\u2019s attorney general from 2011 to 2019. Prior to her state attorney general role, she spent more than 18 years as a prosecutor in the Hillsborough county state attorney\u2019s office. The other Florida natives who have been nominated by Trump include Marco Rubio, Susie Wiles and Michael Waltz. Republican senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota remains skeptical of Pete Hegseth\u2019s nomination for defense secretary. Speaking to NBC about Hegseth\u2019s sexual assault allegations, Cramer, a member of the House\u2019s Armed Services Committee, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty big problem, given that we have\u2026sexual assault problem in our military.\u201d Cramer did not say whether the allegations would impact his vote, NBC reports, but did add: \u201cYou know, this is why you have background checks. This is why you have hearings. This is why you have to go through the scrutiny. I\u2019m not going to prejudge him, but yeah, it\u2019s a pretty concerning accusation.\u201d On Wednesday, police released a 22-page report dating back to 12 October 2017. It includes allegations from a woman who told police that she was sexually assaulted by Hegseth after drinking at a hotel bar in Monterey, California following a Republican women\u2019s event where Hegseth spoke. According to the report, Hegseth assaulted the woman after he took her phone, blocked the door to a hotel room and prevented her from leaving. Hegseth has denied the allegations, saying he was \u201ccompletely cleared.\u201d If confirmed by the Senate, Pam Bondi will assume the nation\u2019s highest law enforcement role under Donald Trump\u2019s administration as attorney general. The Guardian\u2019s Aben\u00e9 Clayton reports on Bondi\u2019s background: Bondi has been a chair at the America First Policy Institute, a thinktank set up by former Trump administration staffers, and served on Trump\u2019s first transition team. The 59-year-old has been a longtime Trump ally \u2013 she was considered during his first term as a potential candidate for the nation\u2019s highest law enforcement role. Trump was told by advisers that she was a good alternative to Gaetz because she has allies across the Republican party as well as inside Trump\u2019s world, according to people familiar with the matter, the Guardian reported on Thursday. For the full explainer, click here: Good morning, Despite Matt Gaetz withdrawing his name as Donald Trump\u2019s attorney general nominee and Trump\u2019s controversial pick of Pam Bondi as his replacement, the drama does not end for the new era of the incoming president. Gaetz\u2019s withdrawal came after multiple meetings with Republican senators on Wednesday who later informed Trump\u2019s team that they continued to oppose his nomination, according to those familiar with the matter. The controversy over Gaetz\u2019s nomination, which has been met with public scrutiny over his sexual assault allegations, shows that Trump is not all-powerful over the Senate, despite the incoming Republican trifecta next year. With Gaetz out of the picture, the attention remains on another one of Trump\u2019s controversial nominations: Pete Hegseth for defense secretary. Since his nomination, the former Fox host has been met with widespread controversy over his own sexual assault allegations. He has also written about the US military taking sides in a \u201ccivil war\u201d and argued that \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t have women in combat roles.\u201d It remains to be seen whether Hegseth can pass the scrutiny of the public eye and secure a Senate confirmation. Here are other developments in US politics: The Senate will not vote on four of Joe Biden\u2019s appellate court nominees in order to hasten the processes of other nominations. Former health secretary Tom Price says he expects Trump to implement block grants for Medicaid.",

      "bodyText": "The US expects thousands of North Korean troops massing in Russia will \u201csoon\u201d enter combat against Ukraine, the secretary of defence said on Saturday. About 10,000 North Korean soldiers were believed to be based in the Russian border region of Kursk, Lloyd Austin said, where they were being \u201cintegrated into the Russian formations\u201d. \u201cBased upon what they\u2019ve been trained on, the way they\u2019ve been integrated into the Russian formations, I fully expect to see them engaged in combat soon,\u201d the Pentagon chief said. He had \u201cnot seen significant reporting\u201d of North Korean troops being \u201cactively engaged in combat\u201d to date, he said. Vladimir Putin has warned that Russia would carry out more tests of its new Oreshnik missile in combat and had a stock ready for use, a day after firing the experimental, nuclear-capable ballistic missile on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. The Russian president described the missile\u2019s first use as a successful test and said more would follow. The Kremlin said the strike on a Ukrainian military facility was designed to warn the west that Moscow would respond to moves by the US and the UK to allow Kyiv strike Russia with their missiles. Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged world leaders to \u201crespond firmly and decisively\u201d after the Russian missile strike on Thursday. The Ukrainian president said his country was working on developing new types of air defence to counter \u201cnew risks\u201d following Russia\u2019s deployment of a new ballistic missile. Ukraine\u2019s parliament cancelled Friday\u2019s session, legislators said, citing the risk of a Russian missile attack on the district of Kyiv where government buildings are located. \u201cThe hour of questions to the government has been cancelled,\u201d said Yevgenia Kravchuk, an MP from the ruling party. \u201cThere are signals of an increased risk of attacks on the government district in the coming days.\u201d Russia sent air defence missiles and other military technology to North Korea in return for the deployment of troops from the North to support its war in Ukraine, intelligence officials in South Korea said. Experts believe North Korea\u2019s dispatch of troops to fight against Ukraine and weapons from its vast stockpiles have been repaid with Russian oil and advanced military technology, Justin McCurry and Emma Graham-Harrison report. Moscow\u2019s forces captured the settlement of Novodmytrivka in eastern Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region, Russia\u2019s defence ministry claimed on Friday \u2013 the latest gain in what the defence minister, Andrei Belousov, described as an accelerated advance. Ukraine\u2019s military made no mention of the village, north of the key town of Kurakhove. But in a late night report, the general staff noted it was among eight villages where Russian forces were engaged in fighting and trying to advance.

The job is one of the most powerful in Washington, with huge influence over America\u2019s gigantic economy and financial markets.</p> <p>The move to select Bessent is the latest as the president-elect starts to pull together the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\">administration</a> for his second term in the White House. The process so far has been marked largely by a focus more on personal and political loyalty to Trump than expertise and experience.</p> <p>In economics, one of the main focuses and controversies of the treasury role will be to deal with Trump\u2019s high-profile and oft-repeated promises to pursue a policy of aggressive new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/09/trumps-trade-tariffs-how-protectionist-us-policies-will-hit-german-carmakers\">US tariffs</a> in foreign trade \u2013 something that is widely feared by many other countries across the globe.</p> <p>Wall Street had been closely watching who Trump would pick for the treasury role, especially given his plans to remake global trade through tariffs.</p> <p>Bessent, 62, has advocated for tax reform and deregulation, particularly to spur more bank lending and energy production, as noted in a recent opinion piece he wrote for the Wall Street Journal.</p> <p>The stock market surge after Trump\u2019s election victory, he wrote, signaled investor \u201cexpectations of higher growth, lower volatility and inflation, and a revitalized economy for all Americans\u201d.</p> <p>Bessent follows other financial luminaries who have taken the job, including the former Goldman Sachs executives Robert Rubin, Hank Paulson and Steven Mnuchin, Trump\u2019s first treasury chief. Janet Yellen, the current secretary and first woman in the job, previously chaired the Federal Reserve and White House council of economic advisers.</p> <p>As the 79th treasury secretary, Bessent would essentially be the highest-ranking US economic official, responsible for maintaining the plumbing of the world\u2019s largest economy, from collecting taxes and paying the nation\u2019s bills to managing the $28.6tn treasury debt market and overseeing financial regulation, including handling and preventing market crises.</p> <p>The treasury boss also runs US financial sanctions policy, oversees the US-led International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other international financial institutions, and manages national security screenings of foreign investments in the US.</p> <p>Bessent would face challenges, including safely managing federal deficits that are forecast to grow by nearly $8tn over a decade due to Trump\u2019s plans to extend expiring tax cuts next year and add generous new breaks, including ending taxes on social security income.</p> <p>Without offsetting revenues, this new debt would add to an unsustainable fiscal trajectory already forecast to balloon US debt by $22tn through 2033.<br>Managing debt increases this large without market indigestion will be a challenge, though Bessent has argued Trump\u2019s agenda would unleash stronger economic growth that would grow revenue and shore up market confidence.</p> <p>Bessent would also inherit the role carved out by Yellen to lead the G7 nations to provide tens of billions of dollars in economic support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia\u2019s invasion and tighten sanctions on Moscow. But given Trump\u2019s desire to end the war quickly and withdraw US financial support for Ukraine, it is unclear whether he would pursue this.</p> <p>Another area where Bessent will likely differ from Yellen is her focus on climate change, from her mandate that development banks expand lending for clean energy to incorporating climate risks into financial regulations and managing hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy tax credits.</p> <p>Trump, a climate-change skeptic, has vowed to increase production of US fossil fuel energy and end the clean-energy subsidies in Joe Biden\u2019s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.</p> <p><em>Reuters contributed to this report</em></p>",

The move to select Bessent is the latest as the president-elect starts to pull together the administration for his second term in the White House. The process so far has been marked largely by a focus more on personal and political loyalty to Trump than expertise and experience. In economics, one of the main focuses and controversies of the treasury role will be to deal with Trump\u2019s high-profile and oft-repeated promises to pursue a policy of aggressive new US tariffs in foreign trade \u2013 something that is widely feared by many other countries across the globe. Wall Street had been closely watching who Trump would pick for the treasury role, especially given his plans to remake global trade through tariffs. Bessent, 62, has advocated for tax reform and deregulation, particularly to spur more bank lending and energy production, as noted in a recent opinion piece he wrote for the Wall Street Journal. The stock market surge after Trump\u2019s election victory, he wrote, signaled investor \u201cexpectations of higher growth, lower volatility and inflation, and a revitalized economy for all Americans\u201d. Bessent follows other financial luminaries who have taken the job, including the former Goldman Sachs executives Robert Rubin, Hank Paulson and Steven Mnuchin, Trump\u2019s first treasury chief. Janet Yellen, the current secretary and first woman in the job, previously chaired the Federal Reserve and White House council of economic advisers. As the 79th treasury secretary, Bessent would essentially be the highest-ranking US economic official, responsible for maintaining the plumbing of the world\u2019s largest economy, from collecting taxes and paying the nation\u2019s bills to managing the $28.6tn treasury debt market and overseeing financial regulation, including handling and preventing market crises. The treasury boss also runs US financial sanctions policy, oversees the US-led International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other international financial institutions, and manages national security screenings of foreign investments in the US. Bessent would face challenges, including safely managing federal deficits that are forecast to grow by nearly $8tn over a decade due to Trump\u2019s plans to extend expiring tax cuts next year and add generous new breaks, including ending taxes on social security income. Without offsetting revenues, this new debt would add to an unsustainable fiscal trajectory already forecast to balloon US debt by $22tn through 2033. Managing debt increases this large without market indigestion will be a challenge, though Bessent has argued Trump\u2019s agenda would unleash stronger economic growth that would grow revenue and shore up market confidence. Bessent would also inherit the role carved out by Yellen to lead the G7 nations to provide tens of billions of dollars in economic support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia\u2019s invasion and tighten sanctions on Moscow. But given Trump\u2019s desire to end the war quickly and withdraw US financial support for Ukraine, it is unclear whether he would pursue this. Another area where Bessent will likely differ from Yellen is her focus on climate change, from her mandate that development banks expand lending for clean energy to incorporating climate risks into financial regulations and managing hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy tax credits. Trump, a climate-change skeptic, has vowed to increase production of US fossil fuel energy and end the clean-energy subsidies in Joe Biden\u2019s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.
