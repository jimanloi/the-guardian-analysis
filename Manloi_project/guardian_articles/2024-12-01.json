But feeling homesick has not evaded him. \u201cI have noticed that this strong homesickness and loneliness comes at sunset when I finish paddling and start to tidy up, which is when it is the hardest,\u201d the release said. \u201cOf course, I knew before the trip that one of my biggest challenges would be enduring that loneliness, which is depressing. \u201cWhen I have an hour of internet, I try to listen to the voice messages of my family and friends through it.\u201d Mockus noticed small signs of potential equipment failure even in the first few weeks. \u201cI already had a problem with one of the lithium-ion batteries, which was almost completely dead, but suddenly recovered,\u201d he said in a media release. \u201cI\u2019m limiting the use of satellite internet and autopilot to save them because it\u2019s a long way to go. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to be without the life-giving batteries that keep the equipment running.\u201d But the most significant loss has been an oar, which broke on Mockus\u2019s 35th day of rowing from the impact of a wave. \u201cYou can\u2019t joke with the ocean when the wind blows over 27 knots overboard, and the waves are more than six meters tall,\u201d he said in a media release. \u201cThe weather conditions were not very kind, but I dared to paddle because sitting and waiting is difficult. \u201cThis had consequences,\u201d he said, \u201cOne unexpected side wave caught me off guard and broke my paddle. Now, there are five paddles left.\u201d Mockus describes the world\u2019s largest ocean as \u201cunpredictable and mighty\u201d. \u201cYou must respect this element and try to survive it and not make mistakes that could cost you dearly,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cOne careless step in a swell could break an arm, a leg, or twist your neck,\u201d he says. \u201cReefs, where underwater islands have formed, are hazardous because of breaking waves and other dangers.\u201d Mockus tries to stay a safe distance from islands and islets, \u201cbut you never know how it will end if the wind blows harder for a longer period\u201d. Despite the ever present danger, there have also been pleasant surprises. \u201cI was accompanied by large groups of dolphins and seals all week off the coast of San Diego,\u201d he said in a media release earlier this month. \u201cI heard whales diving nearby, but you can\u2019t see much more than a few tens of meters from the boat at night, so I didn\u2019t see them with my own eyes. I hope there will be another chance.\u201d \u2018I wanted to dedicate my rowing to Ukrainians\u2019 Mockus set up his boat almost from scratch \u2013 buying only the hull and instruments. He also had to learn proper rowing techniques. Part of his motivation was to draw attention to the conflict in Ukraine, having previously raised funds to support Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, and transported humanitarian aid to the war zone, according to his website. \u201cI know it won\u2019t be easy, but it\u2019s not easy for the people who defend their country either, so I wanted to dedicate my rowing to Ukrainians,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cI decided to remind the world that the war is not over \u2026 We must remember the first day of the war, how we felt, and how afraid we were. \u201cWe cannot get tired because people in Ukraine fight every day and die defending their Motherland.\u201d He says: \u201cI had nothing to do with rowing before \u2026 I aim to show that a simple, determined person can cross the ocean. \u201cThe most important thing is the desire to overcome and to force yourself to do what you want.\u201d",

A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/01/syria-iran-abbas-araghchi-damascas-visit-aleppo-fall-bashar-al-assad\">surprise offensive</a> launched by Syrian rebels from the north west of the country last week has reignited a dormant conflict \u2013 and revealed a change in the balance of power caused not by one but two nearby wars, in Ukraine and Lebanon and the Middle East.</p> \n  <p>Aleppo was the scene of fierce and destructive fighting between 2012 and 2016 when the Syrian civil war was at its height. Rebel groups were forced out as Syrian government forces supporting the president, Bashar al-Assad, were able to capture the country\u2019s second city, with the help of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> and its air force.</p> \n  <p>The Idlib region of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\">Syria</a> in the north-west, with a population of around 5 million, remained outside Assad\u2019s grip, however. An intervention by Turkey in 2020, propped up the position of Hei\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a jihadist Sunni group that broke from al-Qaeda from 2016, but remains proscribed by the UK and other western countries.</p> \n  <p>A ceasefire had remained in place since March 2020, but Assad\u2019s backers have been weakened, and with it the Syrian regime. An attack that began on Wednesday forced a hurried retreat by government forces and by Saturday the city appeared to be in rebel hands, a reminder of the elementary military effectiveness of surprise.</p> \n  <p>The question is why were Assad\u2019s forces so suddenly vulnerable, when four years ago they appeared close to crushing HTS in Idlib. Answers are not difficult to find. Russia is not the force it was in Syria in the last decade, because Moscow has shifted its military focus and resources to its invasion of Ukraine.</p> \n  <p>As the Institute of the Study of War noted on Saturday, S-300 missile systems were withdrawn from Syria for the war in Ukraine in 2022 and Russia\u2019s presence generally down-weighted. Moscow\u2019s ability to provide sustained support for Assad will inevitably be constrained in the longer term.</p> \n  <p>Read the full analysis here: </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/01/rebels-behind-aleppos-surprise-fall-took-advantage-of-russian-and-iranian-distraction\">Rebels behind Aleppo\u2019s surprise fall took advantage of Russian and Iranian distraction</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-674cbae38f088c7046fe0f7d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-12-01T19:46:40.510Z\">7.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Russian war bloggers reported on Sunday that Moscow has dismissed <strong>Sergei Kisel</strong>, the general in charge of its forces in Syria, after insurgents swept into the city of Aleppo in the biggest challenge to President Bashar al-Assad in years.</p> \n  <p>Unconfirmed reports said Kisel was being replaced by Colonel General <strong>Alexander Chaiko</strong>, according to Reuters. </p> \n  <p>Russia is a key Assad ally.

      "bodyText": "Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi traveled to the Syrian capital Damascus, where he told reporters in Iran the purpose of his visit was to convey the strength of Tehran\u2019s backing for Bashar al-Assad and his rule. Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, whose regime is also backed by Moscow, has vowed to \u201cdefend [Syria\u2019s] stability and territorial integrity in the face of all terrorists and their backers\u201d. Britain blamed President Bashar al-Assad for the \u201cescalation\u201d in the Syrian civil war that has seen the city of Aleppo fall to rebel forces. Turkey\u2019s top diplomat discussed the shock rebel offensive in Syria with US secretary of state Antony Blinken, saying Ankara would support moves \u201cto reduce tension\u201d in the war-torn country. In a phone call, foreign minister Hakan Fidan told Blinken that Turkey was \u201cagainst any development that would increase instability in the region and we support moves to reduce the tension in Syria\u201d. At least 372 people have been killed, including at least 20 civilians, since Syrian rebels launched a surprise offensive against Assad on Wednesday, according to the UK-based war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. It said Russian airstrikes killed eight civilians on Sunday in the Idlib province of northwestern Syria, a rebel stronghold. Russia has carried out a wave of airstrikes in Syria today \u2013 including in rural parts of Hama, and Idlib \u2013 as rebel forces continue to push south. The rebels, led by Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which was set up in 2011 as a direct affiliate of al-Qaida, have taken control of Aleppo, Syria\u2019s second largest city. Sources told Reuters that they had also captured sheikh Najjar estate, one of the country\u2019s major industrial zones. On Sunday, the Syrian army said it had recaptured several towns that had been overrun in recent days by rebels. Away from Syria, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees said it is halting aid deliveries through the main cargo crossing into the war-ravaged Gaza Strip because of the threat of armed gangs who have looted recent convoys. It blamed the breakdown of law and order in large part on Israeli policies. A former Israeli defence minister has accused Israel of committing war crimes and ethnic cleansing in the Gaza Strip. Rebels behind Aleppo\u2019s surprise fall took advantage of Russian and Iranian distraction It was not Kyiv that fell in three days, but Aleppo. A surprise offensive launched by Syrian rebels from the north west of the country last week has reignited a dormant conflict \u2013 and revealed a change in the balance of power caused not by one but two nearby wars, in Ukraine and Lebanon and the Middle East. Aleppo was the scene of fierce and destructive fighting between 2012 and 2016 when the Syrian civil war was at its height. Rebel groups were forced out as Syrian government forces supporting the president, Bashar al-Assad, were able to capture the country\u2019s second city, with the help of Russia and its air force. The Idlib region of Syria in the north-west, with a population of around 5 million, remained outside Assad\u2019s grip, however. An intervention by Turkey in 2020, propped up the position of Hei\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a jihadist Sunni group that broke from al-Qaeda from 2016, but remains proscribed by the UK and other western countries. A ceasefire had remained in place since March 2020, but Assad\u2019s backers have been weakened, and with it the Syrian regime. An attack that began on Wednesday forced a hurried retreat by government forces and by Saturday the city appeared to be in rebel hands, a reminder of the elementary military effectiveness of surprise. The question is why were Assad\u2019s forces so suddenly vulnerable, when four years ago they appeared close to crushing HTS in Idlib. Answers are not difficult to find. Russia is not the force it was in Syria in the last decade, because Moscow has shifted its military focus and resources to its invasion of Ukraine. As the Institute of the Study of War noted on Saturday, S-300 missile systems were withdrawn from Syria for the war in Ukraine in 2022 and Russia\u2019s presence generally down-weighted. Moscow\u2019s ability to provide sustained support for Assad will inevitably be constrained in the longer term. Read the full analysis here: Russian war bloggers reported on Sunday that Moscow has dismissed Sergei Kisel, the general in charge of its forces in Syria, after insurgents swept into the city of Aleppo in the biggest challenge to President Bashar al-Assad in years. Unconfirmed reports said Kisel was being replaced by Colonel General Alexander Chaiko, according to Reuters. Russia is a key Assad ally. The removal of Kisel, 53, was reported by the Rybar Telegram channel, which is close to the Russian defence ministry, and by the Voenny Osvedomitel (Military Informant) blog. The Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, told reporters in Iran the purpose of his visit was to convey the strength of Tehran\u2019s backing for Bashar al-Assad and his rule. Araghchi met Assad for talks in Damascus on Sunday evening, with the Syrian president pictured grinning next to the Iranian diplomat. Assad told Araghchi that confronting the sudden insurgency \u201cdoes not serve Syria alone as much as it serves the stability of the entire region\u201d, according to a statement from the Syrian presidency. Araghchi is expected in the Turkish capital, Ankara, on Monday, as Damascus\u2019s allies and opponents scramble to adapt to Assad\u2019s sudden losses in northern Syria. \u201cWe firmly support the Syrian army and government,\u201d Araghchi said, according to the official news agency IRNA. Assad had remained conspicuously absent from public view for several days during the offensive spearheaded by Islamist militants from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), who swept through towns and villages across north-west Syria in less than a week before taking control of Aleppo. Read more on the airstrikes that hit Aleppo and Idlib: \u2018We felt completely lost\u2019: fears over reprisals from Damascus and Islamist rule in Aleppo It was 2am on Saturday when Nasma\u2019s husband told her there were uniformed fighters in their neighbourhood of western Aleppo \u2013 but they were not from the Syrian army. He stood on their balcony to get a better view, before the men told him to go back indoors. News of the militias\u2019 advance in the countryside around Aleppo had spread fast, although Nasma \u2013 who requested a pseudonym for her safety \u2013 didn\u2019t believe that change was coming until she saw displaced people arriving in the city from surrounding villages. \u201cWe had lost hope of something like this ever happening, so we refused to believe it at first, and the main reason for our disbelief was fear,\u201d she said. \u201cIt felt like a distant dream.\u201d Then the militants crossed into Aleppo city. \u201cAt that moment we realised this time was different,\u201d Nasma said. A new kind of fear took over, that of the unknown. \u201cWe felt completely lost,\u201d she said. In the darkness of the early hours on Saturday, the streets of Syria\u2019s second city were empty apart from uniformed fighters largely from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), who roamed Aleppo\u2019s sweeping plazas and gathered under its ancient citadel. They rapidly seized control of much of the city with little resistance from government forces. Within hours, the second largest city in Syria was suddenly under the control of militant Islamists, as shocked residents reeled from the rapid withdrawal of government troops loyal to Damascus. They remained unsure what life would be like under the militants\u2019 newfound rule.

The Hamas visit to Cairo was the first since the United States announced on Wednesday it would revive efforts in collaboration with Qatar, Egypt and Turkey to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza, that would include a hostage deal. The White House national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, said he thought the chances of a ceasefire and hostage deal in the Palestinian territory were now more likely. \u201c[Hamas] are isolated. Hezbollah is no longer fighting with them, and their backers in Iran and elsewhere are preoccupied with other conflicts,\u201d he told CNN on Sunday. \u201cSo I think we may have a chance to make progress, but I\u2019m not going to predict exactly when it will happen \u2026 we\u2019ve come so close so many times and not gotten across the finish line.\u201d A former Israeli defence minister has accused Israel of committing war crimes and ethnic cleansing in the Gaza Strip. Moshe Yaalon, a hawkish former general, told Israeli media that hardliners in Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s far-right cabinet were looking to chase Palestinians from northern Gaza and wanted to re-establish Jewish settlements there, Reuters reported. \u201cI am compelled to warn about what is happening there and is being concealed from us,\u201d Yaalon told Israel\u2019s public broadcaster Kan on Sunday. \u201cAt the end of the day, war crimes are being committed.\u201d After the UN agency for Palestinian refugees announced it is halting aid deliveries through the main cargo crossing point in the Gaza Strip, Scott Anderson, director of Unrwa affairs in Gaza, told the Associated Press: Yesterday we had assurances aid would be fine. We tried to move five trucks and they were all taken. So we\u2019ve kind of reached a point where it makes no sense to continue to try to move aid if it\u2019s just gonna be looted. When asked whether Unrwa had seen evidence supporting Israeli claims that Hamas has been behind aid looting, he said that there was no systemic diversion of aid in Gaza. A spokesperson for Unicef, Ammar Ammar, told the AP the security situation was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and said it was evaluating its operations at the crossing. Britain blamed President Bashar al-Assad for the \u201cescalation\u201d in the Syrian civil war that has seen the city of Aleppo fall to rebel forces, Agence France-Presse reported. \u201cThe Assad regime has created the conditions for the current escalation through its ongoing refusal to engage in a political process and its reliance on Russia and Iran,\u201d the British foreign ministry said in a statement that called for negotiations and for both sides to \u201cprotect civilian lives and infrastructure\u201d. Turkey\u2019s top diplomat discussed the shock rebel offensive in Syria with US secretary of state Antony Blinken, saying Ankara would support moves \u201cto reduce tension\u201d in the war-torn country, according to Agence France-Presse. In a phone call, foreign minister Hakan Fidan told Blinken that Turkey was \u201cagainst any development that would increase instability in the region and we support moves to reduce the tension in Syria\u201d, a ministry source told the news agency. He also said \u201cthe political process between the regime and the opposition should be finalised\u201d to ensure peace and security in Syria while insisting that Ankara would \u201cnever allow terrorist activities against Turkey nor against Syrian civilians\u201d. Inside Aleppo city, streets were mostly empty and many shops were closed on Sunday, as scared residents stayed at home. There was still a heavy flow of civilians leaving the city, witnesses and residents told Reuters. Armed rebel fighters waving the opposition flag drove through the city, Yusuf Khatib, a resident, told the news wire by phone. Some rebels took up positions on street intersections, he added. Ahmad Tutenji, a merchant in the affluent New Aleppo neighbourhood, said he was surprised how quickly the army left. \u201cI am shocked at how they fled and abandoned us.\u201d Abdullah al Halabi, a pensioner whose neighbourhood was bombed near the central area of Qasr al Baladi, said people were terrified they would see a repeat of the Russian-led bombing that killed thousands of people before driving out rebels a decade ago. Syrian troops who had withdrawn from the city were now regrouping and reinforcements were also being sent to help in the counter-attack, army sources told Reuters. Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi travels to the Syrian capital Damascus later today. He told reporters that Tehran will back the Syrian government and army, as rebel forces rapidly advance south. Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, whose regime is also backed by Moscow, has vowed to \u201cdefend [Syria\u2019s] stability and territorial integrity in the face of all terrorists and their backers\u201d. At least 372 people have been killed, including at least 20 civilians, since Syrian rebels launched a surprise offensive against Assad on Wednesday, according to the UK-based war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. It said Russian airstrikes killed eight civilians on Sunday in the Idlib province of northwestern Syria, a rebel stronghold. Russia has carried out a wave of airstrikes in Syria today \u2013 including in rural parts of Hama, and Idlib \u2013 as rebel forces continue to push south. The rebels, led by Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which was set up in 2011 as a direct affiliate of al-Qaida, have taken control of Aleppo, Syria\u2019s second largest city. Sources told Reuters that they had also captured sheikh Najjar estate, one of the country\u2019s major industrial zones. On Sunday, the Syrian army said it had recaptured several towns that had been overrun in recent days by rebels. Here are some of the latest images coming out of Idlib, a north-western Syrian city that has been hit by airstrikes today: Israel is closely watching developments in Syria, Benjamin Netanyahu said as he visited new military recruits at a base in central Israel. \u201cWe are constantly watching events in Syria. We are determined to defend the vital interests of Israel and to maintain the achievements of war,\u201d the Israeli prime minister said. Israel neighbours Syria through the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israel has intensified airstrikes against Iranian forces stationed on the ground in Syria, carrying out more than 116 strikes on Syrian territory, according to the UN, and killing more than 100 people, while Israel\u2019s assault on Lebanon has forced 500,000 people to flee into neighbouring Syria. The UN special envoy for Syria has said the offensive by the rebels poses a risk to regional security and called on resuming diplomatic efforts to end the conflict. \u201cI have repeatedly warned of the risks of escalation in Syria, of the dangers of mere conflict management rather than conflict resolution,\u201d Geir Pedersen said, adding that he believes no Syrian party or grouping of actors can resolve the conflict via military means. The insurgency, led by Salafi jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and which includes Turkey-backed fighters, have vowed to push all the way through to Damascus, the Syrian capital, where there is currently no sign of panic. On Sunday, the Syrian army said it had recaptured several towns that had been overrun in recent days by rebels. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has said Russian airstrikes killed eight civilians on Sunday in the Idlib province of northwestern Syria, a stronghold of the rebels who launched a major offensive against government forces this week. \u201cRussian airstrikes on Sunday targeted one of the camps for displaced people\u201d in the city of Idlib, \u201ckilling eight civilians including two children and a woman, and wounding more than 50 civilians\u201d, the UK-based war monitor said. Idlib is the last remaining opposition stronghold in the country. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights\u2019s chief Rami Abdel Rahman, meanwhile, has told Agence France-Presse (AFP) that \u201cfour Russian airstrikes targeted the square near Aleppo university, killing at least five people\u201d, without saying whether they were civilians or fighters from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and allied factions. The flare-up of fighting in Syria poses a grave threat to regional and international security, the UN envoy to the country said Sunday. \u201cI call for urgent and serious political engagement - among Syrian and international stakeholders - to spare bloodshed and focus on a political solution in accordance with Security Council Resolution 2254\u201d agreed in 2015, Geir Pedersen said in a statement, reported by Agence France-Presse. The UN resolution outlined a roadmap for a political transition in Syria, including a nationwide ceasefire, drafting a new constitution and holding UN-supervised elections. \u201cI have repeatedly warned of the risks of escalation in Syria... and the reality that no Syrian party or existing grouping of actors can resolve the Syrian conflict via military means,\u201d the envoy said. Our video team have produced this report on Russian airstrikes on Idlib. Away from Syria, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees said on Sunday it is halting aid deliveries through the main cargo crossing into the war-ravaged Gaza Strip because of the threat of armed gangs who have looted recent convoys. It blamed the breakdown of law and order in large part on Israeli policies. The decision, as reported by Associated Press, could worsen the humanitarian crisis in Gaza as winter sets in. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA said the route leading to the Kerem Shalom crossing is too dangerous on the Gaza side. Armed men looted nearly 100 trucks travelling on the route in mid-November, and he said gangs stole a smaller shipment on Saturday. Kerem Shalom is the only crossing between Israel and Gaza that is designed for cargo shipments and has been the main artery for aid deliveries since the Rafah crossing with Egypt was shut down in May. Last month, nearly two-thirds of all aid entering Gaza came through Kerem Shalom. In a post on X, Lazzarini largely blamed Israel for the breakdown of humanitarian operations in Gaza, citing \u201cpolitical decisions to restrict the amounts of aid,\u201d lack of safety on aid routes and Israel\u2019s targeting of the Hamas-run police force, which had previously provided public security. There was no immediate comment from Israel on the decision. Syria\u2019s president, Bashar Al-Assad, has vowed to defeat insurgents by force, speaking after rebels swept into the city of Aleppo on Friday. The official Syrian news agency reported his comments, which have been picked up by Reuters. He made the remarks during a phone call with the acting leader of the breakaway Georgian region of Abkhazia, Badra Ganba, the news agency said on Sunday. Government airstrikes overnight on Idlib, the rebel-held bastion near Hama province and 65 kilometers (40 miles) southeast of Aleppo, killed at least four civilians and injured 54 others, according to the Syrian civil defence (the White Helmets) that operates in opposition-held areas. At least 372 people have been killed, including at least 20 civilians, since Syrian rebels launched a surprise offensive against Bashar al-Assad on Wednesday, according to the UK-based war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The death toll also includes military personnel. On Wednesday, the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and allied factions launched a surprise attack on government-held areas of northern Aleppo province, triggering the fiercest fighting in years. Syrian state television claimed government forces had killed nearly 1,000 insurgents over the past three days, without providing evidence or details. Across northern Syria, Turkish-backed Syrian rebel groups and Kurdish militias moved to claim territory rapidly evacuated by forces loyal to Damascus, as Syrian government forces retreated from areas they have held for almost a decade. At the Kuweires airbase, east of Aleppo, video showed Turkish-backed Syrian rebel forces taking control of the base and weaponry there, including an Iranian-made drone. As insurgents pushed south towards the city of Hama, a concerted counterattack by the Syrian army appeared to be taking shape. Damascus\u2019s state news agency and pro-government channels shared images purporting to show business as usual inside Hama itself, with civilians crossing streets of traffic and visiting local markets with piles of vegetables on display, as well as a tour by local police forces. The Syrian defence ministry said it had reinforced defensive lines in the northern Hama countryside to repel a militant advance, after previously promising a counterattack \u201cto recover all regions\u201d, while insurgent forces described fierce battles in the area north of Hama city. Ruth Michaelson is a journalist based in Istanbul Bashar al-Assad had remained conspicuously absent from public view for several days amid a sudden offensive spearheaded by Islamist militants from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), who swept through towns and villages across north-western Syria in less than a week before taking control of Aleppo, the country\u2019s second largest city and a former industrial powerhouse. The embattled Syrian leader reemerged late on Saturday night to conduct a flurry of calls to regional allies in Baghdad and Abu Dhabi, as forces loyal to Damascus appeared to mount a counterattack. Assad told the Emirati president, Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, that the Syrian government \u201cis capable, with the help of its allies and friends\u201d, of repelling the sudden insurgency. The regime in Damascus has long relied on foreign support, notably during the 2016 battle to retake control of Aleppo, where Russian air power proved decisive. The Syrian government has also relied heavily on Iranian forces on the ground including members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. Israel has rapidly scaled up airstrikes against Iranian targets in Syria over the past year amid increasing regional confrontations with Tehran and its proxies. Assad crushed a popular uprising that rose up against him in 2011, before spilling over into a bloody civil war that has fractured his control of the country and left him heavily dependent on backing from Tehran and Moscow. The Syrian leader also employed airstrikes, siege tactics and chemical weapons against his own people during fierce battles to regain control of territory. Rebels said on Sunday they have captured the town of Khansir in an attempt to cut the army\u2019s main supply route to Aleppo, Syria\u2019s second largest city. Rebel sources told Reuters that they had also captured sheikh Najjar estate, one of the country\u2019s major industrial zones. We have been unable to independently verify these claims. As we have been reporting, rebels led by Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which was set up in 2011 as a direct affiliate of al-Qaida, have taken control of Aleppo. This militant group has been leading the recent surprise offensive of insurgents opposed to Assad\u2019s rule. Syria\u2019s conflict broke out after the country\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, brutally crushed pro-democracy protests in 2011. The subsequent civil war, that has drawn in foreign armies and jihadists, has seen more than 500,000 people killed, displaced millions and battered the country\u2019s infrastructure and industry. Iran sent thousands of Shi\u2019ite militias to Syria during the Syrian war and alongside Russia with its air power enabled Assad to crush the insurgency and regain most of his territory. A lack of that manpower to help thwart the rebel attacks in recent days contributed to the speedy retreat of Syrian army forces, sources have told Reuters. Militias allied to Iran, led by Hezbollah, have a strong presence in the Aleppo area. Rebels took advantage of the fact that Iran has been weakened by Israel in recent months and Russia is focusing in its war on Ukraine. As we have been reporting, thousands of Syrian insurgents took over most of Aleppo on Saturday, establishing positions in the city and controlling its airport before expanding their surprise offensive to a nearby province. They seemed to have faced little to no resistance from government troops at the time. Here are some pictures taken yesterday: Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, says he will leave Tehran for Damascus today to deliver a message of support for Syria\u2019s government and armed forces. \u201cI am going to Damascus to convey the message of the Islamic Republic to the Syrian government,\u201d Araghchi said, emphasising Tehran will \u201cfirmly support the Syrian government and army,\u201d the Irna state news agency reported. Araghchi will then make a diplomatic visit to Turkey, which backs rebel groups along Syria\u2019s northern border but has sought recently to normalise relations with Assad. The Syrian army said on Saturday that dozens of its soldiers had been killed in a major attack led by Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham rebels who swept into the city of Aleppo. In a phone call with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, yesterday, Araqchi said that the attacks were part of an Israeli-US plan to destabilise the region, state media said. Welcome to our live coverage of the surprise offensive by rebels in Syria. We will be providiing you with the latest updates throughout the day. Opposition fighters are now reported to have taken control of Aleppo, Syria\u2019s second largest city, and have pushed into several towns in the countryside near the country\u2019s fourth largest city, Hama. Islamist-led rebels on Saturday seized Aleppo\u2019s airport and dozens of nearby towns after overrunning most of Aleppo, a war monitor said. Syria\u2019s army confirmed that the rebels had entered \u201clarge parts\u201d of the city of around two million people and said \u201cdozens of men from our armed forces were killed\u201d. On Wednesday, the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and allied factions launched a surprise attack on government-held areas of northern Aleppo province, triggering the fiercest fighting in years, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said (SOHR). More than 300 people, including at least 20 civilians, have been killed since Wednesday, according to the British-based war monitor. President Bashar al-Assad, whose regime is backed by Moscow and Tehran, has vowed to \u201cdefend [Syria\u2019s] stability and territorial integrity in the face of all terrorists and their backers\u201d. As my colleague Ruth Michaelson notes in this story, the surprise offensive in which insurgents seized territory across north-western Syria marks the most serious challenge to Assad\u2019s control in years. Syria has been gripped by civil war for more than a decade, although the intensity of the conflict had decreased in recent years. At least one civilian was killed after Russia carried out five consecutive airstrikes targeting a refugee camp in a neighbourhood in Idlib, according to the SOHR. It said earlier today that Russia targeted rural parts of Idlib and Hama where the group leading the rebel offensive \u201chas recently taken control\u201d. The Idlib region is subject to a ceasefire \u2013 repeatedly violated but which had largely been holding \u2013 brokered by Turkey and Russia after a Syrian government offensive in March 2020.",

      "bodyText": "During last Friday\u2019s debate in the Commons on assisted dying, Wes Streeting was seen ferociously nodding as MPs raised the need for better end-of-life care. While the health secretary is yet to share his official view on draft proposals for a commission on palliative care, some of those behind it have taken comfort from his apparent gesture of support. Streeting exasperated many of his cabinet colleagues, including Keir Starmer, with his public explanations for voting against the bill, but many Labour figures believe he was right to share his disapproval at the state of end-of-life care. \u201cThey believe it\u2019s fair enough for us to repeatedly blame the former government for the fiscal mess they left behind, so why can\u2019t they highlight how much of a mess the palliative care system is for so many people?\u201d one MP said. They hope Downing Street will feel some obligation to support the independent commission\u2019s work, given the prime minister has silently backed Kim Leadbeater\u2019s private member\u2019s bill so far. Many supporters of assisted dying say legislation, which passed its first Commons hurdle on Friday, should go hand in hand with greater investment in palliative care. About 300,000 people were cared for in the country\u2019s 200-plus hospices in 2022-23, according to Hospice UK. They cost \u00a31.6bn a year to run, with only \u00a3500m coming from the government. The remaining \u00a31.1bn is raised through donations, legacies, charity shops and other fundraising activities. For some Labour figures, the timing of discussions around palliative care is in danger of overshadowing Starmer\u2019s attempts to refocus his premiership this Thursday after a bumpy first few months. One of them said: \u201cHis approval ratings are embarrassingly low, and we\u2019ve had a rough ride already. Surely we can revisit this discussion in the near future?\u201d A backbencher signalled that Starmer appeared to have \u201cshot himself in the foot\u201d, claiming that if MPs had had more time to discuss the assisted dying bill, the prime minister could have had more space for his reset. Morgan McSweeney, Starmer\u2019s chief of staff, is understood to be among No 10 figures who feared that allowing assisted dying legislation to go ahead could prove a distraction from the government\u2019s priority of rebuilding the NHS. That group could take the same view of reforming palliative care. However well Starmer\u2019s reset lands, discussions around the state of care for terminally unwell patients in England and Wales dominated much of the debate last week, to the extent that some MPs who backed it are now considering changing their minds. \u201cI\u2019ve spend the weekend trying to convince myself I made the right decision for my constituents with the time I had. I didn\u2019t vote yes just because it felt like that was the way the wind was blowing within parliament, but because I thought I had read enough,\u201d one new Labour MP said. \u201cBut having listened to some colleagues make their arguments, I do think we really need to consider whether funding that could help people in palliative care could end up going to doctors who are needed to ensure assisted dying can go ahead for people who do need it. \u201cI just want the commission to be able to get on with it as quickly as possible, and I can\u2019t imagine I\u2019ll be the only one.\u201d",

Having the commission is going to be a way of really ensuring that it\u2019s properly integrated into healthcare and ensuring that it is optimised because 100,000 people are not getting it.\u201d</p> <p>However, she warned that the commission needs to ensure expanded end of life care is not \u201cdelivered by a district nurse who is rushed off their feet, running from person to person in the community, so they\u2019re not able to administer drugs at the rate that perhaps is required\u201d.</p> <p>However, NHS experts say that hugely expanding the help it gives to people near the end of their lives as a result of the move to people\u2019s right-to-die will pose an array of challenges. Labour MP Kim Leadbeater\u2019s terminally ill adults (end of life) bill will give terminally ill people with less than six months to live the right to end their lives, as long as two doctors and a high court judge agree.</p> <p>\u201cMPs\u2019 decision to vote to legalise assisted dying has profound implications for the NHS, raising critical practical questions,\u201d said Thea Stein, the chief executive of the Nuffield Trust thinktank.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/30/supporters-assisted-dying-bill-england-wales-vote-mps\">Wavering supporters of assisted dying bill \u2018are not certain to vote it into law\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHow much money will an assisted dying service cost?

Such a service could help the government achieve one of its three \u201cbig shifts\u201d in health, moving care from hospitals into the community, she added.</p> <p>Dr Tim Cooksley, the immediate past president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said the paucity of end-of-life care causes \u201charm and distress on a daily basis for patients and their relatives\u201d. Its patchy nature outside hospitals can deny patients the chance to die at home, he said.</p> <p>\u201cMany patients suffer predictable deterioration at the end of life. Sadly many patients who would prefer to die at home end up being admitted acutely at the end of life due to poorly controlled symptoms. This is largely due to insufficient and inadequate community services, and this is where initial investment needs to be focused\u201d, he said.</p> <p>Lady Ilora Finlay, a former senior medical leader and vocal opponent of assisted dying, has been mooted as a possible chair of the commission.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the British Medical Association \u2013 which represents most UK doctors \u2013 has demanded that assisted dying should be provided by a new dedicated service, which is separate to the NHS\u2019s day-to-day work, and should not lead to existing services losing any of their budget to fund it.</p> <p>\u201cAny future assisted dying process must be funded through new investment and not by taking any money from elsewhere in the health service, which is already overstretched\u201d, said Dr Andrew Green, the chair of the BMA\u2019s medical ethics committee.</p> <p>\u201cWe also believe that it should be provided through a separate service, and not be part of any doctor\u2019s standard work, whether this be a GP, oncologist or palliative care doctor\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "MPs, doctors and charities have drawn up a blueprint to deliver an \u201cunprecedented transformation\u201d of care for 100,000 people a year in the final stages of their lives. After parliament\u2019s historic vote last week to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales, a commission on palliative care has been set up to help improve end-of-life care. The Guardian has seen the details of its ambition that every dying person gets high-quality medical and emotional support, and it understands that ex-prime minister Gordon Brown has backed the plan. The commission\u2019s creation comes as experts warn that ramping up end-of-life care and starting to offer assisted dying will pose big challenges for the NHS amid uncertainty over where such services will be provided, which staff will be involved and how much it will cost. Palliative care is now provided by a combination of the NHS, hospices and charities such as Marie Curie but it is subject to what critics say is a cruel postcode lottery. At least 100,000 people a year are estimated to miss out on such care, which means they are denied a dignified death and can suffer avoidable pain, with loved ones left in distress. Under the terms of reference of the commission, which is being created by Labour MP Rachael Maskell, dying people \u2013 children as well as adults \u2013 would receive ongoing \u201cholistic\u201d support for all of their needs from the moment they are diagnosed with an incurable illness. Health professionals would draw up a \u201ccare plan for the patient throughout end of life, including patient-led care planning, and support for physical, psychological, emotional, social and spiritual wellbeing\u201d, based on the person\u2019s expressed wishes. That would include \u201cnonclinical support\u201d, such as help with financial planning and management of their estate, and also to continue participating in social activities while they still can. There would be \u201csupport for people to fulfil their lives during the receipt of end-of-life care\u201d. Relatives and carers would also be supported during the person\u2019s last weeks and would receive respite care and bereavement support. Such support would need to be \u201cequal across the country and equitable to need\u201d and Britons alerted to its existence through \u201cimproved end-of-life literacy for the public\u201d, according to the commission\u2019s terms of reference. They have been drawn up by Maskell and organisations and medics that currently deliver end-of-life care \u2013 Hospice UK, Marie Curie, Sue Ryder and the Association for Palliative Medicine of Great Britain and Ireland. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, and Brown are among senior figures who have cited the inadequacy of palliative care as a key reason for their opposition to assisted dying, which MPs voted for by 330 to 275 votes last Friday. Maskell said: \u201cEnd-of-life care is a specialty branch of medicine that has been kind of left to wither. Having the commission is going to be a way of really ensuring that it\u2019s properly integrated into healthcare and ensuring that it is optimised because 100,000 people are not getting it.\u201d However, she warned that the commission needs to ensure expanded end of life care is not \u201cdelivered by a district nurse who is rushed off their feet, running from person to person in the community, so they\u2019re not able to administer drugs at the rate that perhaps is required\u201d. However, NHS experts say that hugely expanding the help it gives to people near the end of their lives as a result of the move to people\u2019s right-to-die will pose an array of challenges. Labour MP Kim Leadbeater\u2019s terminally ill adults (end of life) bill will give terminally ill people with less than six months to live the right to end their lives, as long as two doctors and a high court judge agree. \u201cMPs\u2019 decision to vote to legalise assisted dying has profound implications for the NHS, raising critical practical questions,\u201d said Thea Stein, the chief executive of the Nuffield Trust thinktank. \u201cHow much money will an assisted dying service cost? Who will provide it? How is it connected to non-NHS services like home care and hospice care?\u201d Welcoming the commission as \u201cvery timely\u201d, she added that if the ambition of offering proper end-of-life care to everyone who qualified for it was realised, then potentially \u201chundreds of thousands of people might need it every year\u201d. Such a service could help the government achieve one of its three \u201cbig shifts\u201d in health, moving care from hospitals into the community, she added. Dr Tim Cooksley, the immediate past president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said the paucity of end-of-life care causes \u201charm and distress on a daily basis for patients and their relatives\u201d. Its patchy nature outside hospitals can deny patients the chance to die at home, he said. \u201cMany patients suffer predictable deterioration at the end of life. Sadly many patients who would prefer to die at home end up being admitted acutely at the end of life due to poorly controlled symptoms. This is largely due to insufficient and inadequate community services, and this is where initial investment needs to be focused\u201d, he said. Lady Ilora Finlay, a former senior medical leader and vocal opponent of assisted dying, has been mooted as a possible chair of the commission. Meanwhile, the British Medical Association \u2013 which represents most UK doctors \u2013 has demanded that assisted dying should be provided by a new dedicated service, which is separate to the NHS\u2019s day-to-day work, and should not lead to existing services losing any of their budget to fund it. \u201cAny future assisted dying process must be funded through new investment and not by taking any money from elsewhere in the health service, which is already overstretched\u201d, said Dr Andrew Green, the chair of the BMA\u2019s medical ethics committee. \u201cWe also believe that it should be provided through a separate service, and not be part of any doctor\u2019s standard work, whether this be a GP, oncologist or palliative care doctor\u201d.",

He insisted he was not trying to impede Russell as neither driver was on a hot lap but felt he was ignored. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to screw anyone over to prepare their lap and by doing that, being nice, basically you get a penalty. That\u2019s what I tried to explain as well but I just felt like I was talking to a brick wall.\u201d Verstappen\u2019s Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, confirmed that his driver had felt motivated by the incident and that he had made his feelings clear to Russell on the drivers\u2019 parade pre\u2011race. \u201cI think there was a little bit of a moment between the two of them on the trailer as they go around the circuit, that Max felt things just went a bit too far yesterday,\u201d he said.",

Saturday night\u2019s Argentine tango notched another two 10s, leaving her joint second on the leaderboard. Yet when the public vote was combined with judges\u2019 scores,<strong> Tasha Ghouri </strong>had plummeted into the bottom two for the first time.</p> <p>Having outscored <strong>Montell Douglas </strong>by six points on Saturday, she was always likely to survive. However, it\u2019s a sign that Tasha might not be the nailed-on finalist she\u2019s always looked. </p> <p>Sure, she\u2019s the highest scorer in the contest by a distance, never scoring sub-30 and topping the leaderboard seven times. But ringer rumblings about her prior dance experience are only going to get louder. Tasha is very good but, in voting viewers\u2019 minds, she might be too good.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-674cc0bf8f0816561c4a018e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-12-01T20:03:41.049Z\">8.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Another belief-beggaring escape for Pete</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Is Pete Wicks completely bulletproof? Are those pink pleather trousers made of Kevlar? There must be some explanation for how the TOWIE alumnus has still to appear in the dance-off, despite propping up the scoreboard in four weeks out of the last five.</p> <p>Last night\u2019s wobbly West Side Story waltz saw him cut adrift by six points, a huge margin at this stage of the series. Once again, though, voting viewers mobilised and lifted him clear of danger at the expense of far superior dancers. Montell Douglas averages seven points more per routine but Pete\u2019s seen her off. At least he had the decency to look sheepish about it.</p> <p>Mr P Twix clearly has a huge fan following but he\u2019s really not much of a hoofer. In 11 weeks, his scores have only twice crept into the 30s. During Saturday\u2019s live show, pro partner <strong>Jowita Przystal </strong>and some of the judges congratulated him for being able to dance at all. Surely a minimum requirement for a quarter-finalist.</p> <p>Like previous scripted reality alumni <strong>Mark Wright </strong>and<strong> Jamie Laing</strong>, could Pete somehow squeak into the final? He\u2019s at risk of becoming like <strong>John Sergeant</strong> with more Brylcreem and better cheekbones. Let\u2019s hope sanity is restored in the semi-final.</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-12-01T20:40:17.170Z\">at 8.40pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-674cc06c8f08613772568bb7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-12-01T20:01:56.878Z\">8.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Montell excelled - but deserved even better</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It was fourth time unlucky for the unfortunate <strong>Montell Douglas</strong>. After prevailing over <strong>Sam Quek</strong>, <strong>Wynne Evans</strong> and <strong>Jamie Borthwick</strong> in the dance-off over the past month, high-scoring <strong>Tasha Ghouri </strong>proved too tough an opponent - even for a fighter like the Olympian and Gladiator.</p> <p>Montell\u2019s fate seemed sealed last night when she was given both the notoriously difficult, technically exposing rumba and the slot of death. Throw in a musical, The Colour Purple, with which fewer viewers are familiar, and she was already up against it. As the fourth highest scorer of the series, Montell deserved a place in the final on stats alone. The fact that she\u2019s had to scrap for her place since halfway through the series feels unfair.</p> <p>She should have lasted further into December but it\u2019s been lovely to watch her progress over the past 11 weeks. A non-performer who initially lacked confidence, she blossomed under the tutelage of pro partner <strong>Johannes Radebe</strong>, forming the tight \u201cTeam Mojo\u201d. Versatile Montell became both a fiery Latin se\u00f1orita and a classy ballroom performer.</p> <p>Her highlights were her Halloween cha-cha, her Whitney waltz, her Jojo-mirroing paso, last week\u2019s joyous quickstep and, of course, that groundbreaking Afro-Caribbean Couple\u2019s Choice, which notched a near-perfect 39 points - the joint highest score of the series at the time. Judge Anton du Beke advised her to \u201cdo it again in the final\u201d. A shame she won\u2019t get the chance.</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-12-01T20:22:49.877Z\">at 8.22pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-674cbfe18f088c7046fe0f94\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-12-01T19:59:55.015Z\">7.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Montell and Jojo\u2019s last dance</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A standing ovation and rightly so.

JB Gill is a ballroom boy and he\u2019s hoping to blow the judges away with a show-closing routine that\u2019s practically perfect in every way. He topped the leaderboard with a waltz way back in week one, so this should be like slipping on a pair of old dance shoes. Lauren Oakley is channelling the brolly-wielding nanny in a blue suit and jacket. An uplifting routine, full of flair and fun. Dizzying spins, plenty of pizzazz and character. The extra dancers adding a chorus line feel. Lovely cheeky details in the opening section. Skating across the floor with swing and sway. Floating and twirling romantically. Stylish, nostalgic and all-round gaw-jus. Dance of the night for me but will the judges agree?</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>Let\u2019s Go Fly A Kite from Mary Poppins. The breezy song from the end of the 1964 musical when stuffy old George Banks realises his family are more important than his job. It was written by the Sherman brothers, inspired by their father Al, who was a keen amateur kite-maker. Anton du Beke himself danced a Viennese to it in Blackpool 10 years ago with Judy Murray.

He\u2019s odds-on favourite to get knocked out this week. However, deadpan Pete\u2019s Joker-themed Viennese waltz back in week six was his highest scoring ballroom dance, which could be promising. He can\u2019t hide behind the facepaint this time, though. He and Jowita Przystal are playing star-crossed lovers Tony and Maria. Balcony scene to start, dapper styling and a smooth, classic feel. Nice trust-fall. His footwork is hesitant and fluffs it awkwardly. Storytelling full of passion and heartbreak. Improved frame but he needs to soften those knees for rise and fall. Lacks flow and seems strained but spectacular spinning lift to finish. He apologises to her for the mistakes.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>Somewhere from West Side Story.

Who knew that stand-ups sometimes said things for comic effect? Set on an ocean liner from New York to London, he\u2019s hoping to stay afloat and not be sunk by this nautical-themed quickstep. Chris prefers being in ballroom hold and is an entertainer, so this should be right in his wheelhouse. Or boathouse. Smooth, elegant and energetic. He\u2019s leading well and his footwork is astonishing. Great musicality, as always, as they hop and skip across the floor. A neat trick where he rolls on the floor and Dianne Buswell walks over him. Charleston flicks and kicks. Cracking choreography and lovely retro feel. Slight wobble at the end, I think, but a-may-zing.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>You\u2019re The Top from Anything Goes.

Tasha was looking forward to this one but admits it\u2019s been her hardest dance to learn by far. A big song with a strong female empowerment message. She\u2019s regal in a midnight blue catsuit with bejewelled bodice. Faffing about galore to start, then into hold. Powerful, fierce and passionate, with intricate flicks, fast pivots and ganchos. Expressive limbs and close hold, with their bodies in complete contact. Backing dancers a tad distracting but impressive technique, cracking lifts and full of fire.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>Ex-Wives from Six, the musical comedy which retells of Henry VIII\u2019s six lives as a singing competition.

Five previous champions have bounced back from the dance-off to triumph in the final. This rallying cry of a song means a lot to Montell Douglas. About a powerful woman gaining confidence and coming into her own, it resonates with her own Strictly journey. They\u2019re the only couple tonight with no backing dancers. Just Montell and Johannes Radebe on the floor, showcasing how far she\u2019s come as she tackles the tricky slow rumba. Wind machine in effect. Slightly wobbly balance as she shifts her bodyweight but sensual and rhythmic, with head rolls and hip action. Controlled turns, drops and spins. Beautifully in-sync, perhaps a little polite and lacking Cuban sizzle but superb performance levels from Montell.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>I\u2019m Here from The Colour Purple. The 2005 Tony Award-winning musical adapted from Alice Walker\u2019s classic novel has never featured on Strictly before.

She\u2019s being flung about by the extra dancers, as well as partner Vito Coppola, feet barely touching the floor. Flying and, yep, defying gravity. Song a bit stop-start but a proper showstopper. Pure showbiz.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>Popular from Wicked. The bubblegum pop-meets-The-Beatles song sees Glinda trying to help her misunderstood roommate Elphaba conform and make friends. Writer Stephen Schwartz compares the song to the plot of Clueless. It\u2019s been sampled by Mika and recently released by Ariana Grande as the lead single from the film soundtrack.

Whatever one\u2019s feelings, Strictly can\u2019t be faulted for operating as advertised: \u201cNo one is safe based on judges\u2019 scores alone! Your vote counts!\u201d. They\u2019ve certainly kept that promise.</p> <p>Whether Pete\u2019s persistence is explained by Przystal-power polishing his performances (unlikely) or dedicated disciples dead-set on demonstrating that The Only Way Is Pete (unfathomable), it is proof positive that the Strictly dance-competition and popularity-contest elements are inextricably intertwined from start to finish \u2013 except in the dance-off, which the judges are supposed to adjudicate on how well the celebrities dance.

      "bodyText": "As always, thanks for watching along with me, my choreographic compadres. Our famous five now dance into the semi-final, tackling two full routines apiece in their bid to go all the way to the grand glitterball final. It airs next Saturday at the earlier time of 6.30pm on BBC1. Meet you back here to raise our proverbial paddles. In the meantime, you know the drill: keeeeep dancing! Thank you, a glittery goodnight and have a great week. JoeSoap says: \u201cSo puppy dog Pete with the two left feet gets through again at the cost of someone who can actually dance. The public just loves a sob story. Especially the female half.\u201d Vicc says: \u201cI would like to see the BBC have a final It Takes Two after the final for the finalists. It\u2019s too rushed doing it during the final. Channel 4 have a final Extra Slice for the Bake Off finalists and it gives a pleasing end to the series.\u201d jagadox adds: \u201cGoodnight all. And remember, it\u2019s only an entertainment show. Daily Mail-style outrage about the results is bad for the digestion. Inhale some sparkle and try and relax before bed this evening.\u201d diamondcat says: \u201cThat pro dance was breathtaking. When you see them all together, dancing at their best, the effect is electrifying.\u201d fihema says: \u201cCall me sentimental but I am loving this pro dance. It reminds me of watching old Hollywood films on weekend afternoons with my grandmother. It feels a shame that that\u2019s no longer a thing, so it\u2019s fabulous to see this. Nadiya is perfect in the role - and reminds me a little of Kim Basinger in LA Confidential.\u201d emilycatnaps adds: \u201cMontell, I would just like to say that I had never heard of you before (not being someone who follows athletics or watches Gladiators) but I have really enjoyed getting to see and know you every week since the start of Strictly. I think you have been absolutely joyous, and it\u2019s a been a pleasure watching you and JoJo develop a gorgeous partnership. I hope you have enjoyed the madness. And JoJo? You are magnificent, we love you - always.\u201d NellSwift says: \u201cAs a gay woman in her late 50s, it\u2019s been disappointing not only to have no same-sex couples but not to have any pairings in the professional dances either - unless I\u2019ve missed it? Like watching the old Strictly. Think we miss out on the choreography it offers too.\u201d Sueserafina says: \u201cAm I odd for not wanting women warbling about being beheaded in my musical entertainment?\u201d Phoebe adds: \u201cI\u2019m absolutely not complaining but I\u2019ve just realised that we\u2019ve had no Couple\u2019s Choice for the last two weeks. Rejoice!\u201d TomAdlam says: \u201cIs there a more gentle, talented, and generous person on TV than Johannes Radebe? The man is a gem.\u201d fihema says: \u201cI love these shows of gratitude to the people behind the cameras - Montell just now, Gill hugging the cameraman on GBBO - others have thanked them too, but where it sometimes feels a bit \u2018formula\u2019, that look to camera from Montell was truly warming.\u201d Gardener_Maidhc says: \u201cI am trying to resign myself to the fact that Chris and Pete will probably make the final and stronger dancers will continue to be eliminated.\u201d A swift round-up of your Musicals Week musings. rosybeeme says: \u201cCan someone explain the attraction of the lugubrious Pete to his fans? I\u2019m not being mean but I just don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s a travesty that Montell\u2019s out.\u201d EmmyHarb says: \u201cPete getting through again is getting even this blog fairly heated tonight. He obviously has a huge fanbase and a much broader appeal to the public than Montell.\u201d Shotsboy1991 says: \u201cJust ridiculous that Pete Wick is still in this. Outraged for MoJo, so unfair.\u201d Somersetlass adds: \u201cSuch grace from Mojo - both physical and emotional. Good to see them smiling in their last dance. Ah well, not the result I wanted, but that\u2019s Strictly.\u201d Viewers can now stay on BBC One for Antiques Roadshow from Cromford Mills in Derbyshire or flip to Channel 5 for Magical Christmas Windows: From Hamleys to Harrods. At 9pm, choose from Wolf Hall: The Mirror &amp; The Light on BBC One, I\u2019m A Celebrity on ITV1 or The 1970s Supermarket at Christmas on Channel 5. If you fancy a film to welcome in December, there\u2019s A Quantum Of Solace (8pm on ITV4), Cape Fear (11pm on BBC2) or Spider-Man: Homecoming (11.45pm on BBC1). Past Peter Parker\u2019s bedtime, surely? Male celebrities finished bottom and joint second bottom of the leaderboard. Yet somehow we still ended up with an all-female dance-off. There were also grumbling from commenters last night that the male celebs got more crowd-pleasing songs and better slots in the running order last night. The upshot is that we have three men and two women in our final five. Time to jettison Pete and balance the gender books? Just saying. South African pro Johannes Radebe always appears to be a dream dance partner and he did another beautiful job with Montell Douglas - turning her from a powerhouse athlete into a real performer, nurturing her confidence and helping her bounce back from multiple dance-offs with a smile on her face. The pair\u2019s farewell speeches were evidence of their close bond. Strictly fans were spooked by tabloid stories last month that this would be Jojo\u2019s last series. To our relief, Jojo denied this, saying: \u201cI want to do this beautiful show for as long as they want me - and the body will allow.\u201d Phew, frankly. In his six years on Strictly, Johannes has reached the final with both John Whaite and Annabel Croft. He can consider himself unlucky not to have survived another week or two with Montell. The day when Jojo finally gets his hands on the glitterball trophy will be a happy day. She scored the first maximum of the series last week. Saturday night\u2019s Argentine tango notched another two 10s, leaving her joint second on the leaderboard. Yet when the public vote was combined with judges\u2019 scores, Tasha Ghouri had plummeted into the bottom two for the first time. Having outscored Montell Douglas by six points on Saturday, she was always likely to survive. However, it\u2019s a sign that Tasha might not be the nailed-on finalist she\u2019s always looked. Sure, she\u2019s the highest scorer in the contest by a distance, never scoring sub-30 and topping the leaderboard seven times. But ringer rumblings about her prior dance experience are only going to get louder. Tasha is very good but, in voting viewers\u2019 minds, she might be too good. Is Pete Wicks completely bulletproof? Are those pink pleather trousers made of Kevlar? There must be some explanation for how the TOWIE alumnus has still to appear in the dance-off, despite propping up the scoreboard in four weeks out of the last five. Last night\u2019s wobbly West Side Story waltz saw him cut adrift by six points, a huge margin at this stage of the series. Once again, though, voting viewers mobilised and lifted him clear of danger at the expense of far superior dancers. Montell Douglas averages seven points more per routine but Pete\u2019s seen her off. At least he had the decency to look sheepish about it. Mr P Twix clearly has a huge fan following but he\u2019s really not much of a hoofer. In 11 weeks, his scores have only twice crept into the 30s. During Saturday\u2019s live show, pro partner Jowita Przystal and some of the judges congratulated him for being able to dance at all. Surely a minimum requirement for a quarter-finalist. Like previous scripted reality alumni Mark Wright and Jamie Laing, could Pete somehow squeak into the final? He\u2019s at risk of becoming like John Sergeant with more Brylcreem and better cheekbones. Let\u2019s hope sanity is restored in the semi-final. It was fourth time unlucky for the unfortunate Montell Douglas. After prevailing over Sam Quek, Wynne Evans and Jamie Borthwick in the dance-off over the past month, high-scoring Tasha Ghouri proved too tough an opponent - even for a fighter like the Olympian and Gladiator. Montell\u2019s fate seemed sealed last night when she was given both the notoriously difficult, technically exposing rumba and the slot of death. Throw in a musical, The Colour Purple, with which fewer viewers are familiar, and she was already up against it. As the fourth highest scorer of the series, Montell deserved a place in the final on stats alone. The fact that she\u2019s had to scrap for her place since halfway through the series feels unfair. She should have lasted further into December but it\u2019s been lovely to watch her progress over the past 11 weeks. A non-performer who initially lacked confidence, she blossomed under the tutelage of pro partner Johannes Radebe, forming the tight \u201cTeam Mojo\u201d. Versatile Montell became both a fiery Latin se\u00f1orita and a classy ballroom performer. Her highlights were her Halloween cha-cha, her Whitney waltz, her Jojo-mirroing paso, last week\u2019s joyous quickstep and, of course, that groundbreaking Afro-Caribbean Couple\u2019s Choice, which notched a near-perfect 39 points - the joint highest score of the series at the time. Judge Anton du Beke advised her to \u201cdo it again in the final\u201d. A shame she won\u2019t get the chance. A standing ovation and rightly so. As Team Mojo take a final twirl around the floor to Thank You For The Music by the mighty Abba, the credits roll and their castmates descend for consoling cuddles. Or perhaps in Pete Wicks\u2019 case, profuse apologies. Please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. Her pro partner Johannes Radebe returns the compliment: \u201cI am so proud of you because, honey, you are a non-dancer. But the one thing that you have done every single week is turn out beautiful dancing. So I want to say thank you for respecting our art form of ballroom and Latin. The way you handled it was like a true pro. You\u2019re my winner.\u201d What a diamond he is. In her exit speech, an emotional Montell Douglas tells Tess: \u201cJohannes has been amazing. Strictly has touched me in ways I never knew possible. I\u2019m an Olympian and a Gladiator but I have honestly struggled with confidence my whole life. Being on the show, with the beautiful crew, judges and cast, has just been such an honour. I have to say thank you to Johannes because I really have found a friend and a brother in this man. I mean it from the bottom of my heart, I hope he\u2019s in my life forever, because we have something very special.\u201d Beautifully said. Yep, it\u2019s unanimous. Twirly Shirley Trunchbull says she would have decided the same. It\u2019s official. The majority vote means that Montell Douglas and Johannes Radebe become the 10th duo to depart the Strictly 2024 dancefloor. Tasha and Alja\u017e, saying \u201ca hard-fought dance-off but my position doesn\u2019t shift\u201d. Tasha and Alja\u017e, saying \u201cboth couples were authentic and emotionally real\u201d. Tasha and Alja\u017e, saying \u201cboth couples were amazing and shouldn\u2019t be here but they stood out, were technically cleaner and nailed it\u201d. I\u2019ve got a sinking inkling which way this will go but let\u2019s hear from the panel who decide. Craig and Motsi both scored Tasha two points more last night, Shirley and Anton one point more. Tasha Ghouri and her pro partner Alja\u017e \u0160korjanec have another go at their Argentine tango to Ex-Wives from Six. The judges said last night that her \u201cspaghetti legs\u201d were on a whole different level but it was a bit braced and balletic, more like a show-tango than a reactive Argentine. Still, it scored two 10s and a total of 38 points, six more than Montell, so maintain the standard and you\u2019d imagine Tasha will be fine. Montell Douglas and her dance partner Johannes Radebe reprise their rumba to I\u2019m Here from The Colour Purple. The judges said last night that it lost flexibility and fluidity. She needed more stretch in her feet and to breathe through the moves but their storytelling was emotional. She scored 32 points, six fewer than Tasha, so needs to show improvement and hope for mistakes from her opponent. Elements of foxtrot and quickstep, all in unison, which makes for a stunning sight. You can\u2019t beat it when the pros do proper ballroom. Nostalgic entertainment, bringing vintage cinema to vivid life. Nadiya Bychkova transforms into faded screen siren Norma Desmond, returning to the location of her happiest memories when she was a superstar of silent movies. Alja\u017e \u0160korjanec takes the male lead. A musicals-themed group number from the Strictly professionals now, whisking us back to the golden age of Hollywood and set to As If We Never Said Goodbye from Sunset Boulevard. This Andrew Lloyd Webber belter expresses our heroine\u2019s longing to return to the spotlight. Barbra Streisand\u2019s cover version charted in the UK in 1994. And her pet Percy gets more airtime. \u201cWhat a cat,\u201d says Claudia, slightly unconvincingly. More balcony bantz . The semi-final is on JB Gill\u2019s birthday. Expect cake. I suppose that had an air of inevitability. Montell Douglas and Johannes Radebe are in the dance-off for the fourth time. Glinda the good witch and Vito Coppola swivel their way into the semi-final. No surprise after that show-stopping, leaderboard-topping Mary Poppins waltz. Mewwy Cwistmas to all TV Burp fans! That dreaded scarlet lightbulb of doom is back to reveal who\u2019ll face Tasha in the dreaded dance-off. Craig needs a cuddle. That\u2019s what Claudia says. No 10 for JB because of a thumb, I ask you. He\u2019s \u201cshocked\u201d that Pete has gone through but says he\u2019s committed, honest and he can see \u201cwhy the audience at home are adoring him\u201d. On Tasha being in the dance-off, Motsi Mabuse is \u201cliterally speechless\u201d (NB: not literally). Time for the regular feature, formerly known as Len\u2019s Lens (RIP). The judges park their posteriors on Claudia\u2019s banquette for a closer squizz at last night\u2019s routines. No choreographic accompaniment from the Strictly pros. Dancefloor too crowded. Also, try ballroom dancing to this. They cram a lot of lyrics in, don\u2019t they? Historical exposition waits for no man. Time for this week\u2019s musical interlude and it\u2019s a special performance of The Schuyler Sisters from Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s musical Hamilton. Inspired by Destiny\u2019s Child, it sees the socialite Dutch sisters from 18th century New York, who played a prominent role in the formation of the United States, harmonising in a rousing power anthem. \u201cI\u2019m just a 47-year-old man who signed the wrong form,\u201d says Chris. The comedian only thought he\u2019d get to \u201cweek three, max\u201d. Ditto, babes. Up in the Clauditorium, the relieved couples who are safely through to the semi-final chat with La Winkle. A tearful Pete is \u201chumbled\u201d by the public votes. Oof, that\u2019s one of the biggest shockers of the series so far. Tasha plummets from joint second on the leaderboard into the bottom two, meaning she\u2019ll Argentine tango again for survival with pro partner Alja\u017e \u0160korjanec. The comedian and a jubilant Dianne Buswell deservedly progress. Woah. The lionine Essex lad dodged danger again. Another dance-off surprise looks on the cards. That pesky crimson spotlight begins to flicker. Time to find out who\u2019s qualified for the semi-final and who\u2019s dancing again for survival. The judging panel take their front row seats. Thankfully, Anton has removed his glam-rock dinnerlady wig and Shirley\u2019s nasty Trunchbullitis skin condition has cleared up. The six pro-celebrity pairs anxiously await the results, wearing various nautical and nanny outfits. A rewind of Saturday night\u2019s live show on-screen now. Wicked Witch of the Charleston! Quick McStepland! Wicks Side Story! Let\u2019s go fly a kite! Here come our co-hosts, so time for our regular sartorial showdown. Tess Daly is working a black corset and trews. Claudia Winkleman in a sparkly black two-piece. Claud wins, making it a clean sweep for Rip Van Winkleman this weekend. Cue clap-along credits. Go on, which couple had you completely forgotten were ever in the contest? Charge glasses, plump cushions and take your sofa seats. We\u2019re about to go back to the Elstree Studios ballroom\u2026 That was many readers\u2019 predictions for tonight\u2019s dance-off, just as it was seven days ago. It didn\u2019t transpire last time. Will it tonight? Buckle up, ballroom fans. Just five minutes to wait now\u2026 The latest episode of David Attenborough\u2019s Asia just drawing to a close on BBC1. This one\u2019s called \u201cCrowded Continent\u201d, about animals living in close quarters with humans. Hence elephants stopping traffic for food (trunky literally wants a bun), a flying squirrel living in a Taipei school and a Bangkok park with 300 giant lizards. That\u2019d give unsuspecting dog-walkers a fright. It\u2019s a mere 10 minutes until glittery go-time\u2026 Another email just in from regular reader, Iain Crofts in Montreal. He writes: For once, I was not stymied by a historical reference in Saturday\u2019s liveblog. I entertained myself on Friday night by watching the DVD issued in 2016 to celebrate Len Goodman\u2019s time as a judge on Strictly: Len\u2019s Grand Finale. Judy Murray\u2019s waltz with Anton to Let\u2019s Go Fly a Kite was included among Len\u2019s favourite or otherwise memorable dances. I\u2019m looking forward to viewing the clip of JB Gill\u2019s waltz from today. As you say, it\u2019s a great tune for waltzing to. All the better if the dance goes well. Dear old Len. Fifteen minutes until the clock strikes sequins\u2026 Reader Peter Gibbs writes: Chris and Pete certainly have a big voting following, no matter what. So I\u2019m worrying that two of the bigger-hitting couples will have to face off. Please, PLEASE not JB and Lauren. You\u2019ve got to think Montell is in it yet again. which is a gloomy outlook to have, but sadly almost nailed on. PS as every week, thank you for the Guardian Blog \u2013 in our house, currently referred to as \u201cMichael Hogan\u2019s G-Spot\u201d The pro group number this evening will pay homage to Sunset Boulevard, while the musical interlude is a signature song from Hamilton. Who needs West End ticket prices? It\u2019s 20 minutes until curtain up News broke last night that Strictly professional Carlos Gu has sustained an ankle injury and will be unable to participate in this year\u2019s Christmas Special. Fellow pro Gorka M\u00e1rquez will be stepping in to dance with contestant Vogue Williams instead. We wish poor Carlos a speedy recovery. Nobody wants a surgical support boot for their Christmas stocking. It\u2019s 25 minutes until showtime\u2026 Pete Wicks came into this weekend as odds-on favourite for elimination once more. He duly finished bottom of the scoreboard for the third week running. Will viewers ride to his rescue again? In an unpredictable series, could we see another dance-off shocker? Half an hour until we findoiut\u2026 Someone is about to be axed from the Musicals Week cast, missing out on the semi-final. Good evening and welcome to the penultimate elimination from Strictly Come Dancing 2024. I\u2019m Michael, your Sunday night understudy for tonight\u2019s results show. Please watch along with me as the 10th celebrity takes their Strictly bow. Of our six surviving pro-celebrity pairs, only a fabulous five can progress to dance two routines apiece in next Saturday\u2019s semi. The judges\u2019 scores have been combined with viewer votes and tonight the bottom two duo will be consigned to the dreaded eliminator. So who\u2019s in dance-off danger? Last night saw JB Gill waltz to the top of the leaderboard after his Mary Poppins blockbuster closed the show, notching his third near-perfect 39. Just a point behind in joint second spot were Sarah Hadland and Tasha Ghouri. Way down the bottom again was Pete Wicks, with Chris McCausland and Montell Douglas above him. But will voting viewers agree? If not, anyone could come into choreographic contention. It\u2019s results showtime at 7.20pm on BBC One. I\u2019ll be liveblogging from 6.50pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and cheek from the cheap seats. So hunker down on this nippy Sunday night and I\u2019ll see you on the sofa. As always, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts too. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me at michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for sequin-spangled chat. I\u2019ll fleckerl and contra check down there every now and again, whenever possible to catch up on what you\u2019re saying. The curtain is about to come down on another couple. Nearly time to staaaaaart dancing into the semi-final! That concludes Saturday\u2019s livebloggery-pokery but please feel free to continue the backstage badinage in the comments section. Meet you back here tomorrow for this year\u2019s penultimate results show. It airs at 7.20pm Sunday on BBC1, featuring special numbers from Hamilton and Sunset Boulevard. I\u2019ll raise the curtain on the blog at 6.50pm for build-up, so please rejoin me then. In the meantime, I\u2019m @michaelhogan on X and @michaelhogan100 on Bluesky/Threads, so feel free to drop in for a luvvie-ish airkiss. Thanks for watching along with me. See you tomorrow but in the meantime, it\u2019s the traditional thespian motto: keeeeeep dancing! Just don\u2019t mention the Scottish play. Goodnight. Unless the public vote springs a surprise, it looks like Montell Douglas and Pete Wicks are doomed to dance again for survival on Sunday. Doesn\u2019t it? Finally, Somersetlass says: \u201cGiving the more obscure music to the women, while the men get well-known songs seems likely to affect the votes.\u201d On JB Gill, jagadox says: \u201cA Viennese waltz needs good posture. For a moment , I thought she was going to do something XXX-rated with that umbrella.\u201d YodaknowsAll says: \u201cJB\u2019s posture is brilliant. There was real drive in that V-waltz as well. My favourite dance of the night.\u201d SparklingDormouse says: \u201cJB has crept into my top three. Now I think he\u2019s my favourite. Great at Latin and now absolutely killing ballroom! FABULOUS!\u201d FascinatingFlamenco adds: \u201cJB has come so far. I feel confident when watching him and that was joyous. JB to win!\u201d On Pete Wicks, Aine183 says: \u201cI really like Pete, but he doesn\u2018t seem to be on the same level with the other contestants. It\u2019s the quarter-final!\u201d mutterful says: \u201cThat\u2019s why people are voting for P Twix. From nowhere to that - mistakes &amp; all.\u201d OozblumBird adds: \u201cNice routine from Pete and Jovita but error-strewn. He\u2019s really going to need his fanbase to get him through to the semis. I think this time, it\u2019ll be dance-off for Pete. Room for improvement, so his goose isn\u2019t quite cooked.\u201d On Chris and Dianne\u2019s quickstep, heroica says: \u201cAt last a true musical and a proper musical number. That\u2019s what it should all be like, Chris and Dianne. That was wonderful and one of my favourite songs ever. He can dance!\u201d paperview says: \u201cWOW! Chris produced the best dance so far. It was so simply done - and so excellent. Loved it. Loved it. Loved it.\u201d dancingbears adds: \u201cSo many things to admire about Chris but perhaps the most remarkable is his spatial awareness, his sense of just where Dianne will be. Each week, he inspires me and makes me want to weep with joy.\u201d On Tasha Ghouri, VelvetinaB says: \u201cI wish we could have seen an Argentine tango to decent music. This song is awful and the strobe lighting without warning!!!!\u201d Dunntalkin says: \u201cNah, not an Argentine tango. Impressive gymnastic display, but no connection at all. If they hadn\u2019t said it was an Argentine tango, I never would have recognized it. Sorry.\u201d acanthe adds: \u201cCraig - yes! I felt that was more of a showdance than an AT. Despite my beloved Aljaz.\u201d On Montell Douglas, BenCaldwell88 says: \u201cMontell going second with a rumba to a lesser-known musical song? They gave the poor girl all the Strictly curses at once.\u201d NonIronLady says: \u201cGood on Sarah Greene on It Takes Two last night, asking the question about why Montell has been in so many dance-offs. As she said, it can\u2019t be anything to do with the dancing.\u201d TomAdlam adds: \u201cSensational dance by Johannes and Montell. It won\u2019t be enough to keep them out of the dance-off, though. Pete and Chris could turn up on one leg and get enough votes to keep them in.\u201d Ndl4321 says of Sarah Hadland\u2019s Charleston: \u201cMaybe I\u2019m being grumpy but too many lifts for me, Geoff.\u201d Somersetlass says: \u201cOh, what fun! Incredible lifts and I didn\u2019t see Sarah put a foot wrong. Vito looks so proud of her.\u201d fihema adds: \u201cOoh, that dance from Sarah and Vito made me happy. She seemed totally in control, the spotlight was on her and that could have been straight from the stage show. Great start to the show! I\u2019ve already forgotten the pros\u2019 dance.\u201d The notices are in, luvvies. Here\u2019s a rapid-fire round-up of your comments. MarkRoche says: \u201cAnton looks like Rod Hull.\u201d ReclinedPotato says: \u201cNice to see Bob Downe joining the judging panel tonight.\u201d Shazza2704 says: \u201cAnton has come as lead singer of The Sweet. Ballroom Blitz!\u201d Lidoswimmer adds: \u201cAnton\u2019s giving me Robin Askwith vibes.\u201d Confessions of a dance judge, anyone? Who needs standing ovations or Olivier Awards? Here are this week\u2019s gong-getters\u2026 Best dance: JB Gill closing the show in marvellous Mary Poppins style. Worst dance: Pete Wicks\u2019 whoopsie of a waltz. Best music choice: Let\u2019s Go Fly A Kite. Not just a banger but it actually suited the dance, unlike some. Worst music choice: Montell Douglas and Tasha Ghouri were both poorly served by songs that weren\u2019t exactly hummable household favourites. Best outfit: Dianne Buswell\u2019s nautical-but-nice number or Lauren Oakley\u2019s Mary Poppins suit. Worst outfit: Judges Shirley or Anton. Distracting dinner lady wigs and facial prosthetics ahoy. Best VT: Lee Mack singing the praises of Chris McCausland\u2019s \u201csexy hips\u201d. Also liked Lauren\u2019s magic carpet bag. Worst VT: Pete and Jowita in their matchy-matchy beanies of sincerity. Best judges\u2019 comment: Anton telling Dame Daly: \u201cI went to your hairdresser and asked for the full Tess.\u201d Best Claudia quip: Enjoyed her mentions of \u201cinnards\u201d and \u201cAuntie Joan again\u201d but the prize goes to: \u201cDancing with a mole is the dream. I\u2019m obsessed. Never actually seen one, though.\u201d Yeah alright, Chris Packham. TV viewers can now stay tuned to BBC One for Michael McIntyre\u2019s The Wheel or flip to ITV for The Chase Celebrity Special on ITV1, featuring Strictly alumnus Karim Zeroual and reigning glitterball champion Ellie Leach. At 9pm, there\u2019s Game of Throws: Inside Darts on Sky Documentaries or I\u2019m A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here on ITV1. If you\u2019re in the mood for a movie, tonight\u2019s slim pickings are Dreamgirls (9pm on ITVBe), About Time (9pm on 5Star ) or The Rock (10pm on ITV4). NB: The Alcatraz Island thriller, not Dwayne Johnson off of Moana 2. JB Gill rightly takes top billing on the quarter-final scoreboard with a near-perfect 39. Sarah Hadland and Tasha Ghouri just a point behind in joint second spot. There\u2019s then a six-point gap to Montell Douglas and Chris McCausland \u2013 and then another six point gap to Pete Wicks way down the bottom. Surely his time is up. Straight after Strictly, we get our first look at the BBC\u2019s new Christmas idents, starring Wallace &amp; Gromit. Anyone else suddenly have a craving for Wensleydale cheese on an oat biscuit? Chorus line leaders Tess and Claud tell us to \u201cKeeeeeep dancing!\u201d. As the credits roll, please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. An encore for the night\u2019s six routines on-screen now. Glitz! Glamour! Goofy facial expressions! Lots and lots of wigs! Which West End wendys are you voting for? Which Broadway berties are you definitely not? The ribbon is snipped on the voting lines and the traditional chaos erupts. Hats ahoy. Who wants to be a milliner? Judges\u2019 scores for JB and Lauren: 9, 10, 10, 10 for a total of 39 points. Top of the pops. Saved the best \u2018til last. Judges\u2019 comments for JB and Lauren: Shirley says \u201can iconic performance, immaculate, the night belongs to you\u201d. Anton mentions Judy Murray (drink!) says \u201cpractically perfect in every possible way\u201d. Craig says \u201cyour thumb was sticking up and over-turned pivots, so close to perfection but best dance of this evening\u201d. Motsi concludes \u201cdapper and fantastic flow, you\u2019re so versatile\u201d. Another 39-pointer for JB, do we reckon? Is now the bit where we get outraged that the songs are originally from film musicals, not stage shows? Can he get more 10s after last week\u2019s 39-point Charleston? JB Gill is a ballroom boy and he\u2019s hoping to blow the judges away with a show-closing routine that\u2019s practically perfect in every way. He topped the leaderboard with a waltz way back in week one, so this should be like slipping on a pair of old dance shoes. Lauren Oakley is channelling the brolly-wielding nanny in a blue suit and jacket. An uplifting routine, full of flair and fun. Dizzying spins, plenty of pizzazz and character. The extra dancers adding a chorus line feel. Lovely cheeky details in the opening section. Skating across the floor with swing and sway. Floating and twirling romantically. Stylish, nostalgic and all-round gaw-jus. Dance of the night for me but will the judges agree? Song: Let\u2019s Go Fly A Kite from Mary Poppins. The breezy song from the end of the 1964 musical when stuffy old George Banks realises his family are more important than his job. It was written by the Sherman brothers, inspired by their father Al, who was a keen amateur kite-maker. Anton du Beke himself danced a Viennese to it in Blackpool 10 years ago with Judy Murray. They scored just 24 points and were promptly eliminated. Oops. Judges\u2019 scores for Pete and Jowita: 5, 7, 7, 7 for a total of 26 points. Bottom by a distance. Surely he\u2019s doomed for the dance-off at last? Judges\u2019 comments for Pete and Jowita: Anton says \u201ca disaster downstairs but you\u2019ve come so far in your dancing development, your work out of hold is beautiful\u201d. Craig says \u201clove what you brought to it but footwork shoddy, no heel leads, swing nor sway, went completely wrong but it didn\u2019t bother me because the storytelling was engaging\u201d. Motsi says \u201catmosphere transported me, clean it up downstairs\u201d. Shirley concludes \u201cextraordinary frame improvement, sensitive, made mistakes but picked up afterwards\u201d. Sevens, do we say? It was clear from last week\u2019s results show that Pete Wicks wasn\u2019t familiar with West Side Story but presumably he\u2019s learnt this week. He\u2019s odds-on favourite to get knocked out this week. However, deadpan Pete\u2019s Joker-themed Viennese waltz back in week six was his highest scoring ballroom dance, which could be promising. He can\u2019t hide behind the facepaint this time, though. He and Jowita Przystal are playing star-crossed lovers Tony and Maria. Balcony scene to start, dapper styling and a smooth, classic feel. Nice trust-fall. His footwork is hesitant and fluffs it awkwardly. Storytelling full of passion and heartbreak. Improved frame but he needs to soften those knees for rise and fall. Lacks flow and seems strained but spectacular spinning lift to finish. He apologises to her for the mistakes. Song: Somewhere from West Side Story. The Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim ballad from the Romeo &amp; Juliet-inspired musical set in 1950s Manhattan. It was covered by the Supremes, PJ Proby, Barbra Streisand, Marianne Faithfull, Pet Shop Boys and, ahem, Phil Collins. Altogether now: \u201cThere\u2019s a place for us\u2026\u201d Judges\u2019 scores for Chris and Dianne: 7, 8, 8, 9 for a total of 32 points. Bit harsh. Joint bottom with Montell as it stands. Chris will be having words with his right arm later. Dianne is endearingly emotional with how well he\u2019s done. Aww. Judges\u2019 comments for Chris and Dianne: Dianne is jubilant. Rousing reception in the studio. Shirley says \u201cflexible, fluid, outstanding movement across the floor, frame dropped a bit on one side, otherwise joyous\u201d. Anton says \u201cgreat feel, atmosphere and partnering but I\u2019m with Shirley on your right arm, so close to being wonderful, don\u2019t stop\u201d. Craig says \u201cexceptional floor coverage but posture suffered, fudged footwork at the end\u201d. \u201cThat was me,\u201d says Dianne gallantly. Motsi concludes \u201cexcellent energy, you let go as the dance progressed\u201d. Nines ahoy? Chris McCausland caused a kerfuffle last week by admitting he was musicals-sceptic: \u201cThey\u2019re absolutely pointless. If it\u2019s by adults for adults, grow up.\u201d After online outrage from the jazzhands community, he\u2019s sort-of-but-not-really apologised. Who knew that stand-ups sometimes said things for comic effect? Set on an ocean liner from New York to London, he\u2019s hoping to stay afloat and not be sunk by this nautical-themed quickstep. Chris prefers being in ballroom hold and is an entertainer, so this should be right in his wheelhouse. Or boathouse. Smooth, elegant and energetic. He\u2019s leading well and his footwork is astonishing. Great musicality, as always, as they hop and skip across the floor. A neat trick where he rolls on the floor and Dianne Buswell walks over him. Charleston flicks and kicks. Cracking choreography and lovely retro feel. Slight wobble at the end, I think, but a-may-zing. Song: You\u2019re The Top from Anything Goes. Cole Porter\u2019s song from his 1934 Broadway show sees a man and a woman take turns complimenting each other in rhyming superlatives. Some of the lyrics were rewritten by PG Wodehouse for the British version. Alja\u017e \u0160korjanec and Call The Midwife actress Helen George performed a Charleston in Blackpool to the musical\u2019s title song. Judges\u2019 scores for Tasha and Alja\u017e: 9, 10, 9, 10 for a total of 38 points. Higher scores than the comments suggested. Spaghetti legs, apparently. Dirty Dancing fans, clearly. I carried a watermelon. Judges\u2019 comments for Tasha and Alja\u017e: Tess has \u201cturned into one giant goosebump\u201d. Enduring image. Motsi says \u201cI will never stop celebrating you, that was excellent dancing, legs on a whole different level\u201d. Shirley says \u201clots to like, loved the lifts but a bit stiff and braced\u201d. Anton says \u201cI\u2019m in Motsi\u2019s camp, that was outstanding, can\u2019t even nit-pick\u201d. Craig concludes: \u201cI can nit-pick, darling, this was a show-tango, not reactive enough and stiff of leg, too balletic but powerful, clean and sharp, you looked like the star amid the pros\u201d. Eights and nines incoming? Can last week\u2019s leaderboard-toppers and perfect 40-scorers repeat the feat? They\u2019re unlikely to get the chop, at least, unlike Henry VIII\u2019s wives. They\u2019re performing just the third Argentine tango of the series, after Jamie Borthwick\u2019s and Sarah Hadland\u2019s. Tasha was looking forward to this one but admits it\u2019s been her hardest dance to learn by far. A big song with a strong female empowerment message. She\u2019s regal in a midnight blue catsuit with bejewelled bodice. Faffing about galore to start, then into hold. Powerful, fierce and passionate, with intricate flicks, fast pivots and ganchos. Expressive limbs and close hold, with their bodies in complete contact. Backing dancers a tad distracting but impressive technique, cracking lifts and full of fire. Song: Ex-Wives from Six, the musical comedy which retells of Henry VIII\u2019s six lives as a singing competition. Strictly has pulled off a coup by landing Olivier-nominated Natalie Paris - who originated the role of Jane Seymour at the Edinburgh Fringe and in the West End - to sing live in the ballroom. Why have they put the three female celebrities on back-to-back? Bit odd. Judges\u2019 scores for Montell and Jojo: 7, 8, 8, 9 for a total of 32 points. Johannes points out that Montell has no ligaments in her ankles. Oof. But I fear dance-off danger. Just me or does Anton look like Rick Parfitt from Status Quo in that wig? Foxtrottin\u2019 all over the world. Judges\u2019 comments for Montell and Jojo: Craig says \u201cslow and exposing, lacked technique, lost fluidity and ooze but incredible moments\u201d. Motsi says \u201csoftened up and worked on your leg action, nice hands and changes of pace, needed stretch in your feet\u201d. Shirley says \u201cbeautiful back-walks, 100% sure-footed but work on flexibility of feet and breathing\u201d. Anton concludes \u201cgreat stillness and emotional storytelling\u201d. Eights and nines? They\u2019re now triple dance-off survivors but as Craig pointed out last week, you can still win the glitterball if you\u2019ve been in the bottom two. Five previous champions have bounced back from the dance-off to triumph in the final. This rallying cry of a song means a lot to Montell Douglas. About a powerful woman gaining confidence and coming into her own, it resonates with her own Strictly journey. They\u2019re the only couple tonight with no backing dancers. Just Montell and Johannes Radebe on the floor, showcasing how far she\u2019s come as she tackles the tricky slow rumba. Wind machine in effect. Slightly wobbly balance as she shifts her bodyweight but sensual and rhythmic, with head rolls and hip action. Controlled turns, drops and spins. Beautifully in-sync, perhaps a little polite and lacking Cuban sizzle but superb performance levels from Montell. Song: I\u2019m Here from The Colour Purple. The 2005 Tony Award-winning musical adapted from Alice Walker\u2019s classic novel has never featured on Strictly before. It ran at London\u2019s Menier Chocolate Factory in 2013 with Cynthia Erivo in the leading role as Celie. Up in the Clauditorium, theatreland\u2019s very own Layton Williams (a former Strictly finalist, of course) is this week\u2019s VIP guest, reading out the voting smallprint. Darling, you\u2019ve done it again. A triumph. Quite some outfit and all. Judges\u2019 scores for Sarah and Vito: 9, 9, 10, 10 for a total of 38 points. Miranda Hart is in the house. Vito flogs a salad metaphor to within an inch of its life. Judges\u2019 comments for Sarah and Vito: Motsi says \u201cwell-placed, great timing, didn\u2019t miss a beat\u201d. Shirley Trunchbull says \u201cyou\u2019ve set the standard, flawless lifts, great details, loved it\u201d. Anton says \u201ca wonderful piece of musical theatre, I love watching you dance\u201d. Bearded Craig concludes \u201cprim characterisation, precise and well presented\u201d. A nines and three 10s, do we reckon? We\u2019re not in Kansas anymore. Well, yes, we\u2019re in Borehamwood. Sarah Hadland has Grande shoes to fill as Galinda the good witch. With the blockbuster movie cleaning up at box offices, it\u2019s a good time to pay hoofing homage. Sarah\u2019s in a ruffled pink mini-dress. A bouncy, high-energy Charleston should suit her. Slow start with some messin\u2019 abaht, then into a dynamic dance with cracking characterisation. Plenty of swivel and packed with clean lifts. She\u2019s being flung about by the extra dancers, as well as partner Vito Coppola, feet barely touching the floor. Flying and, yep, defying gravity. Song a bit stop-start but a proper showstopper. Pure showbiz. Song: Popular from Wicked. The bubblegum pop-meets-The-Beatles song sees Glinda trying to help her misunderstood roommate Elphaba conform and make friends. Writer Stephen Schwartz compares the song to the plot of Clueless. It\u2019s been sampled by Mika and recently released by Ariana Grande as the lead single from the film soundtrack. Frankie Bridge and Annabel Croft have previously performed Strictly numbers to songs from Wicked. Our six couples take their bow. The fancy dress box has been raided, as expected. Tasha Ghouri is in Tudor garb. Lauren Oakley is Mary Poppins. Sarah Hadland has come as a cupcake, I think. The paddle-raising quartet emerge onto the Strictly stage. Fancy dress all round. Motsi Mabuse is a Dreamgirl, Shirley Ballas is Miss Trunchbull and Craig Revel Horwood in drag as the bearded lady from The Greatest Showman. Anton Du Beke in a technicolour dreamcoat with terrible mullet again, aka Claud\u2019s Auntie Joan. Here comes our two-headed hostly hydra, so time for a Musicals edition of our usual fashion match-up. Tess Daly is sporting a one-shouldered red trouser suit. Claudia Winkleman is in a black sequinned mini with tuxedo top. Claud wins. Carlos Gu plays the peckish shrub. It\u2019s basically Day Of The Triffids with jazzhands, isn\u2019t it? Feed me, Seymour! Neil Jones plays the Rick Moranis role as the nerdy florist who discovers a sentient carnivorous plant which feeds on human blood. Luba Mushtuk plays the object of Seymour\u2019s affections, his colleague Audrey. Kai Widdrington is villainous dentist Orin Scrivello. Unusually for a live show - but hey, it\u2019s Musicals Week - we open with a razzle-dazzle group routine from the Strictly professionals. It\u2019s based on 80s show Little Shop of Horrors. Reckon Vicky Gill got a multi-buy deal on top hats? Nine couples down, six remain. It\u2019ll be five by tomorrow. Dropping like foxtrotting flies, they are. Cue VT to crank up the drama. Have we mentioned that it\u2019s Musicals Week yet? Open your \u201csharing\u201d box of Maltesers and raise the safety curtain. We\u2019re about to go over live to the Elstree Studios ballroom\u2026 Alan Carr\u2019s Numberwang on BBC1 now, despite the series allegedly finishing last week. I think this must be a repeat. Why, ye scheduling gods, why? Mere minutes to wait now\u2026 There\u2019s a ballroom-heavy bill for Musicals Week, with two waltzes (one Viennese, one international) and a quickstep. We\u2019ll also be treated to a rumba, a Charleston and an Argentine tango. Those latter two especially could be showstoppers. Hold tight, it\u2019s just five minutes until the choreographic kick-off\u2026 Clocking in at a mere 70 minutes, tonight is the shortest live show of the series. Snappy Come Dancing, more like. We\u2019ve made it to the brink of December. There\u2019s only three live shows left - and only two results shows. The race for the glitterball trophy is well and truly on. It\u2019s just 10 minutes until the clock strikes sequins\u2026 Email just in from regular reader, Iain Crofts in Montreal: As we brace ourselves for the final themed week, we ponder a theme from last week\u2019s comments: was it unfair for the public vote to keep Pete Wicks out of last week\u2019s dance-off? Whatever one\u2019s feelings, Strictly can\u2019t be faulted for operating as advertised: \u201cNo one is safe based on judges\u2019 scores alone! Your vote counts!\u201d. They\u2019ve certainly kept that promise. Whether Pete\u2019s persistence is explained by Przystal-power polishing his performances (unlikely) or dedicated disciples dead-set on demonstrating that The Only Way Is Pete (unfathomable), it is proof positive that the Strictly dance-competition and popularity-contest elements are inextricably intertwined from start to finish \u2013 except in the dance-off, which the judges are supposed to adjudicate on how well the celebrities dance. If Pete lands in one, it would seem that The Only Way is Out. But you never know. I\u2019m still reeling from Tom being trounced by Toyah in the first dance-off of this series. Cross them off as you spot them on-screen! Take a drink for each! Get ejected from the dress circle for singing along too loudly! Here\u2019s your 10-point spotter\u2019s guide for tonight\u2019s Musicals Week action: Training room VT makes mention of \u201cfundamentals for Shirley\u201d or \u201cswivel for Craig\u201d Celebrity in green face-paint, using up a make-up department glut from previous Shrek/Wicked/Hulk routines Overuse of the words \u201ciconic\u201d and \u201clegendary\u201d Anton makes disparaging mention of his Mary Poppins waltz with Judy Murray Craig modestly mentions his West End choreography credits Someone gets compared to Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers/Gene Kelly/Bob Fosse Shirley thanks couples for \u201copening our show\u201d and \u201cclosing our show\u201d A couple meet the cast of a West End show during their pre-dance VT A West End star reads out the voting Ts&amp;Cs in the Clauditorium Claudia totally loses it whenever Vito Coppola speaks For the second weekend running, Pete Wicks is bookies\u2019 odds-on tip for elimination this weekend. He\u2019s been bottom of the scoreboard three times and is the lowest scorer left in the contest by a distance, averaging four points fewer per dance than anyone else. Montell Douglas is second favourite, then there\u2019s a big gap to JB Gill in third. Can they dazzle voting viewers enough to secure safety? Twenty minutes until the glittery curtain comes up\u2026 We haven\u2019t seen supporting dancers since Blackpool Tower Ballroom but they\u2019re back tonight, lending that big production feel to the musicals-themed numbers. Montell Douglas and Johannes Radebe are the only couple to perform on their own, as they create an intimate mood for their rumba. Coincidentally, Jojo was in the same position last year, except with Annabel Croft and a foxtrot. It\u2019s 22 minutes until that ba-ba-da theme tune\u2026 It\u2019s been a high-standard but unpredictable series, with couples pinging up and down the pecking order. Last week\u2019s dancefloor departee, Jamie Borthwick, had been both top and bottom of the scoreboard. Meanwhile, Pete Wicks being saved by viewer votes meant that for the fifth time in 10 weeks, the couple at the bottom of the leaderboard avoided elimination. This series, all bets are off. Will we see another surprise this weekend? We\u2019ll get our first clues in 25 minutes\u2026 And who\u2019ll be a box office flop? Yes, it\u2019s time for Strictly\u2019s annual night out in Theatreland. Good evening and welcome to week 11 of Strictly Come Dancing 2023. I\u2019m Michael, your fellow thesp for tonight\u2019s live musicals-themed quarter-final. I\u2019d love you to watch along with me as our couples perform routines inspired by West End and Broadway hits, bidding to make it through to the semi-final. Last weekend saw jubilant scenes in the ballroom as Tasha Ghouri scored the first perfect 40 of the series for her swoon-worthy American smooth. This was followed by the hip-shaking chaos of the samaba-thon, won by JB Gill. After dance-off drama, EastEnders actor Jamie Borthwick and his pro partner Michelle Tsiakkas were sent home Our six surviving pro-celebrity pairings now take to floor, channelling the world of musical theatre. You know the deal by now. Tonight\u2019s scores will be combined with the public vote and the bottom two will dance-off for survival on Sunday night. Pete Wicks is bookies\u2019 hot tip for the chop but he\u2019s defied the odds before. It\u2019s showtime at 7.05pm on BBC One. I\u2019ll be liveblogging from 6.35pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and heckles from the cheap seats. So don your theatrical finery, pre-order your interval drinks and I\u2019ll see you on the sofa. As ever, I\u2019d love to hear from you too. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for your first night reviews. I\u2019ll pop a coin in my opera glasses to peer at you\u2019re all saying. Will Craig Revel Horwood dust off his perfect 10 paddle again? Can Montell Douglas bounce back from her third dance-off? Can Pete pull off another Houdini-esque escape? It\u2019s nearly time to staaaart all-singing and all-dancing!",

      "body": "<p>The Green party in Ireland has been virtually wiped out in the general election, and its leader admitted it was entering a period of \u201crebuild\u201d after the electorate removed any prospect of the party re-entering government.</p> <p>The Greens lost all but one of their 12 seats, with its leader, Roderic O\u2019Gorman, scraping through on the 13th count.</p> <p>It means the party is unlikely to team up again with the two centre-right parties, Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael, which are on track to come within a few seats of the 88-seat majority needed to form the new government. </p> <p>Counting from Friday\u2019s election could continue into Monday. The proportional representation system involves multiple counts and too-close-to-call scraps for the final seats in many constituencies.</p>    <p>The party\u2019s losses are the worst since 2011 when it was left with no seats in the election, triggered by the financial crash and IMF bailout.</p> <p>Eamon Ryan, the recently retired leader succeeded by O\u2019Gorman, said even one seat would make \u201ca huge difference\u201d because it would not repeat his experience post-2011 when the Greens had no voice at all in parliament and no funding.</p> <p>Among several high-profile losers in the Irish election was the gangland figure Gerry Hutch, who lost out to Labour in the Dublin Central constituency, where the four seats were filled by others including the Sinn F\u00e9in leader, Mary Lou McDonald.</p> <p>Hutch caused pandemonium when he arrived at the Dublin count centre, posing gnomically for a media scrum for 15 minutes. He clashed with RT\u00c9\u2019s reporter but took a question from the BBC, who asked if he would run again. \u201cI\u2019ve been running all my life,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Named in a court case last year as the head of a well-known crime family in Ireland, Hutch, known as \u201cthe Monk\u201d, was released on bail in Lanzarote to run for parliament after his arrest in Spain last month as part of an international investigation into money laundering.</p> <p>Hutch said in a recent podcast interview that he had had several convictions for robbery as a young man. He has not been convicted of any other crime more recently and, in a rare 2008 interview with RT\u00c9, he denied being the leader of a crime gang.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/30/fianna-fail-fine-gael-irish-government-sinn-fein-coalition\">Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael in pole position to form new Irish government</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the results appeared to point to the return of some form of coalition between Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael, the centre-right parties hailed Ireland\u2019s reversal of global trends and pointed in particular to the voters\u2019 broad spurning of far-right candidates.</p> <p>Jack Chambers, the Fianna F\u00e1il deputy leader, said: \u201cI think, in the main, centrist politics in Ireland has strengthened here. We haven\u2019t seen the level of fragmentation in other countries, the level of polarisation in politics.

      "bodyText": "The Green party in Ireland has been virtually wiped out in the general election, and its leader admitted it was entering a period of \u201crebuild\u201d after the electorate removed any prospect of the party re-entering government. The Greens lost all but one of their 12 seats, with its leader, Roderic O\u2019Gorman, scraping through on the 13th count. It means the party is unlikely to team up again with the two centre-right parties, Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael, which are on track to come within a few seats of the 88-seat majority needed to form the new government. Counting from Friday\u2019s election could continue into Monday. The proportional representation system involves multiple counts and too-close-to-call scraps for the final seats in many constituencies. The party\u2019s losses are the worst since 2011 when it was left with no seats in the election, triggered by the financial crash and IMF bailout. Eamon Ryan, the recently retired leader succeeded by O\u2019Gorman, said even one seat would make \u201ca huge difference\u201d because it would not repeat his experience post-2011 when the Greens had no voice at all in parliament and no funding. Among several high-profile losers in the Irish election was the gangland figure Gerry Hutch, who lost out to Labour in the Dublin Central constituency, where the four seats were filled by others including the Sinn F\u00e9in leader, Mary Lou McDonald. Hutch caused pandemonium when he arrived at the Dublin count centre, posing gnomically for a media scrum for 15 minutes. He clashed with RT\u00c9\u2019s reporter but took a question from the BBC, who asked if he would run again. \u201cI\u2019ve been running all my life,\u201d he said. Named in a court case last year as the head of a well-known crime family in Ireland, Hutch, known as \u201cthe Monk\u201d, was released on bail in Lanzarote to run for parliament after his arrest in Spain last month as part of an international investigation into money laundering. Hutch said in a recent podcast interview that he had had several convictions for robbery as a young man. He has not been convicted of any other crime more recently and, in a rare 2008 interview with RT\u00c9, he denied being the leader of a crime gang. As the results appeared to point to the return of some form of coalition between Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael, the centre-right parties hailed Ireland\u2019s reversal of global trends and pointed in particular to the voters\u2019 broad spurning of far-right candidates. Jack Chambers, the Fianna F\u00e1il deputy leader, said: \u201cI think, in the main, centrist politics in Ireland has strengthened here. We haven\u2019t seen the level of fragmentation in other countries, the level of polarisation in politics. In fact, if you look at the far-right candidates which presented themselves for election, there\u2019s clear rejection of their politics in Ireland.\u201d Chambers said that although the election was cataclysmic for the Greens, it had strengthened two other parties on the left, with the Social Democrats expected to get more than 10 seats and Labour on course for eight or more. Sinn F\u00e9in, which got 19% of first-preference votes, behind Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s 21.9% and Fine Gael\u2019s 20.8%, is expected to get more than 30 seats but not enough to lead government formation talks. Among the issues that created problems for the Greens was a carbon tax on petrol, aimed at discouraging people from consuming carbon-emitting fuel, which was introduced by the previous government but blamed on the Greens. There were also rows about Ireland\u2019s derogation from an EU directive on nitrates, commonly used in fertiliser seeping into rivers: Fianna F\u00e1il committed to retaining it while the Greens wanted to phase it out and prioritise river quality. Ciar\u00e1n Cuffe, a member of the party for 40 years and a former MEP, said the Greens had been \u201cthe fall guys\u201d and had paid the price for being incumbents. \u201cI think small-party incumbency is at the heart of this. In the Irish political context, it is always tough for the junior partner in government to argue about what it has achieved in government, and it seems to be held responsible for every other department, including the ones it doesn\u2019t control. That\u2019s what happened to Labour in 2016, it happened to us in 2011 and it seems to have happened to us again now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were seen as the fall guys. We were being attacked from two sides, from some of our core supporters who felt we weren\u2019t doing enough, and then quite a few loud voices within Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael who were saying that the Greens were destroying the country, so we were stuck between a rock and a hard place,\u201d he said.

Araghchi, in a call with his Syrian counterpart on Friday, blamed the sudden territorial gains by Islamist militants in north-west Syria on the US and Israel, claiming they were behind the advance. The militants\u2019 sweeping territorial gains prompted questions about the Syrian army\u2019s capacity to mount a response while its backers have deployed resources elsewhere, with Russian forces more focused on the fight in Ukraine. The advance also sparked a flurry of regional diplomacy, with the Jordanian foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, speaking to his Syrian counterpart to express \u201cJordan\u2019s concern over the unfolding events\u201d while advocating for a political resolution in Syria.

Fidan also told the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, that Ankara \u201copposes developments that would increase instability in the region\u201d. Officials in Ankara, which backs select elements of Syria\u2019s armed opposition, had recently offered to normalise relations with Damascus, after regional leaders who once shunned Assad had begun welcoming him back into the fold. The US national security council spokesperson Sean Savett said on Saturday night that Washington was \u201cclosely monitoring the situation in Syria\u201d and had been \u201cin contact over the last 48 hours with regional capitals\u201d. The Assad regime\u2019s reliance on Russian and Iranian backing created the current instability, he said, \u201cincluding the collapse of Assad regime lines in north-west Syria\u201d. He added that \u201cthe United States has nothing to do with this offensive\u201d, pointing out that HTS was previously designated a terrorist organisation. Across northern Syria, Turkish-backed Syrian rebel groups and Kurdish militias moved to claim territory rapidly evacuated by forces loyal to Damascus, as Syrian government forces retreated from areas they had held for almost a decade. At the Kuweires airbase, east of Aleppo, video showed Turkish-backed Syrian rebel forces taking control of the base and weaponry there, including an Iranian-made drone. The same group said it had seized control of the town of Tel Rifaat, north of Aleppo, in an attempt to oust Kurdish militants from the area.",

It has largely evaded nationalism since emerging from communism in 1989.</p> <p>Amid widespread voter anger over the cost of living and a legacy of corruption among its mainstream parties, observers had said the far right, led by the AUR, was likely to benefit most from the confusion, which has further dented trust in state institutions.</p> <p>Romania has the EU\u2019s biggest share of people at risk of poverty, the bloc\u2019s highest inflation rate and its largest budget deficit.</p> <p>Far-right parties have used Romania\u2019s strong backing of Ukraine to stoke fears that the war could spill over the border unless the country halts its support, as well as foster resentment over alleged preferential treatment for refugees from Ukraine.</p> <p>The outgoing president, Klaus Iohannis, said Sunday\u2019s vote would in effect decide whether Romania remained \u201ca country of freedom and openness, or collapses into toxic isolation and a dark past\u201d.</p> <p>The centre-left PSD and centre-right PNL, both members of the outgoing government, have dominated Romania\u2019s politics for three decades, but the exit polls suggested the new legislature would be far more fragmented, making it hard to form a new coalition.</p> <p>The AUR more than doubled its result of 8.5% in the previous elections. Along with the party of Young People (POT), which has backed Georgescu, and the extreme-right SOS Romania, both of which were on course to clear the 5% threshold to enter parliament, far-right parties could hold about 30% of seats in the new assembly.</p> <p>If the exit polls prove accurate, a pro-west mainstream coalition led by the PSD could in principle have enough MPs to form a government, but analysts said negotiations would be difficult and could take weeks.</p> <p>\u201cThe Social Democrats will take a few days and wait to be courted,\u201d the political commentator Radu Magdin told Reuters. \u201cA coalition with centrist parties is more likely than with the extremists. And much depends on who becomes president.\u201d</p> <p>As things stand, Georgescu should face Lasconi in a runoff on 8 December \u2013 although depending on the court\u2019s decision, both presidential votes could be delayed until later this month, adding to the political uncertainty.</p> <p>The presidential office said last week officials had detected online efforts to influence voting in the presidential ballot, with one candidate benefiting from \u201cmassive exposure due to preferential treatment\u201d on the social media platform TikTok.</p> <p>TikTok has dismissed the allegations, saying it enforced all guidelines against election misinformation.</p> <p>Georgescu has called for an end to the war in Ukraine, denied the existence of Covid-19, described two second world war-era Romanian fascists as \u201cnational heroes\u201d and claimed that in foreign affairs Romania would benefit from \u201cRussian wisdom\u201d.</p>",

The vote was the second of three successive ballots and came a week after C\u0103lin Georgescu, a little-known far-right, Moscow-friendly independent, plunged the country into turmoil by finishing first in the opening round of the presidential vote. Georgescu\u2019s success, after a campaign that he said had no financing and that was based heavily on viral TikTok videos boosted by bot-like activity, raised suspicions of foreign interference and caused fears Romania would veer to the far right. Romania\u2019s top court ordered a recount and on Monday is due to rule on a request by a defeated candidate to annul the vote altogether over allegations of illegal electoral activity on behalf of the runner-up, Elena Lasconi of the pro-EU USR. The elections are seen as critical to the future direction of Romania, hitherto a reliable EU and Nato ally that is strategically important for western support for Ukraine. It has largely evaded nationalism since emerging from communism in 1989. Amid widespread voter anger over the cost of living and a legacy of corruption among its mainstream parties, observers had said the far right, led by the AUR, was likely to benefit most from the confusion, which has further dented trust in state institutions. Romania has the EU\u2019s biggest share of people at risk of poverty, the bloc\u2019s highest inflation rate and its largest budget deficit. Far-right parties have used Romania\u2019s strong backing of Ukraine to stoke fears that the war could spill over the border unless the country halts its support, as well as foster resentment over alleged preferential treatment for refugees from Ukraine. The outgoing president, Klaus Iohannis, said Sunday\u2019s vote would in effect decide whether Romania remained \u201ca country of freedom and openness, or collapses into toxic isolation and a dark past\u201d. The centre-left PSD and centre-right PNL, both members of the outgoing government, have dominated Romania\u2019s politics for three decades, but the exit polls suggested the new legislature would be far more fragmented, making it hard to form a new coalition. The AUR more than doubled its result of 8.5% in the previous elections. Along with the party of Young People (POT), which has backed Georgescu, and the extreme-right SOS Romania, both of which were on course to clear the 5% threshold to enter parliament, far-right parties could hold about 30% of seats in the new assembly. If the exit polls prove accurate, a pro-west mainstream coalition led by the PSD could in principle have enough MPs to form a government, but analysts said negotiations would be difficult and could take weeks. \u201cThe Social Democrats will take a few days and wait to be courted,\u201d the political commentator Radu Magdin told Reuters. \u201cA coalition with centrist parties is more likely than with the extremists. And much depends on who becomes president.\u201d As things stand, Georgescu should face Lasconi in a runoff on 8 December \u2013 although depending on the court\u2019s decision, both presidential votes could be delayed until later this month, adding to the political uncertainty. The presidential office said last week officials had detected online efforts to influence voting in the presidential ballot, with one candidate benefiting from \u201cmassive exposure due to preferential treatment\u201d on the social media platform TikTok. TikTok has dismissed the allegations, saying it enforced all guidelines against election misinformation. Georgescu has called for an end to the war in Ukraine, denied the existence of Covid-19, described two second world war-era Romanian fascists as \u201cnational heroes\u201d and claimed that in foreign affairs Romania would benefit from \u201cRussian wisdom\u201d.",

Democrats are trying to chart the way forward after losing the White House and control of the Senate, as well as failing to retake the House of Representatives. Wikler said the national party could learn from organizing efforts he has overseen in Wisconsin, even though Kamala Harris narrowly lost the state to Trump. Wikler said Democrats also need to focus on the president-elect\u2019s economic agenda, which he claimed will favor wealthy Americans rather than working families. \u201cFor Democrats, this is a critical time to unite and fight back against Trump\u2019s plans,\u201d Wikler said.

      "body": "<p>In the opening stages of this year\u2019s Premiership it has not exactly been the vintage Sale Sharks we have grown accustomed to seeing in recent seasons. However, one thing that has been a hallmark of Alex Sanderson\u2019s tenure remains the same as we approach the halfway point in the campaign: if they are to make the playoffs, it will be their home form that is likely decisive.</p> \n<p>The Sharks have lost just five Premiership games on home soil since Sanderson was appointed in January 2021. It is a remarkable record, and one which could be more important than ever this season given their polarising form on their travels. Eight games in, Sale have lost all four of their away matches \u2013 two of them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/26/bath-sale-premiership-rugby-match-report\">bruising</a>, heavy losses against Northampton and Bath before the international break.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/30/northampton-gloucester-premiership-rugby-union-match-report\">Carreras runs the show as Gloucester end Northampton\u2019s unbeaten home run</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But their home form is once again magnificent, with this hard-earned victory against Leicester not only reducing the gap to the top four to just five points, but making it four wins from four at the Salford Community Stadium. The Sharks are a different breed at home and here, a magnificent second-half display laid the platform to hand the Tigers their first away defeat of the season.</p> \n<p>Leading by just a point at half-time, 17 points inside the first 10 minutes after the restart proved to be decisive for Sale. They head into the Champions Cup in buoyant mood with a display that was much, much more like the Sharks we are used to seeing. \u201cIt\u2019s really rewarding to see the fruits of our labour today when we needed it,\u201d Sanderson said.</p> \n<p>Leicester remain third but will probably be frustrated to return down the M6 without even a losing bonus point to their name. For most of the opening quarter they were the superior side, opening the scoring through a Nicky Smith try before a penalty from Handr\u00e9 Pollard made it 8-0.

      "bodyText": "In the opening stages of this year\u2019s Premiership it has not exactly been the vintage Sale Sharks we have grown accustomed to seeing in recent seasons. However, one thing that has been a hallmark of Alex Sanderson\u2019s tenure remains the same as we approach the halfway point in the campaign: if they are to make the playoffs, it will be their home form that is likely decisive. The Sharks have lost just five Premiership games on home soil since Sanderson was appointed in January 2021. It is a remarkable record, and one which could be more important than ever this season given their polarising form on their travels. Eight games in, Sale have lost all four of their away matches \u2013 two of them bruising, heavy losses against Northampton and Bath before the international break. But their home form is once again magnificent, with this hard-earned victory against Leicester not only reducing the gap to the top four to just five points, but making it four wins from four at the Salford Community Stadium. The Sharks are a different breed at home and here, a magnificent second-half display laid the platform to hand the Tigers their first away defeat of the season. Leading by just a point at half-time, 17 points inside the first 10 minutes after the restart proved to be decisive for Sale. They head into the Champions Cup in buoyant mood with a display that was much, much more like the Sharks we are used to seeing. \u201cIt\u2019s really rewarding to see the fruits of our labour today when we needed it,\u201d Sanderson said. Leicester remain third but will probably be frustrated to return down the M6 without even a losing bonus point to their name. For most of the opening quarter they were the superior side, opening the scoring through a Nicky Smith try before a penalty from Handr\u00e9 Pollard made it 8-0. By that stage, the Tigers had a 7-1 penalty count in their favour and were frequent visitors into Sale\u2019s 22. So for the Sharks to only be eight points behind at that time would have likely resembled something of a win for the hosts, who eventually wrestled a grip on proceedings when Dan du Preez marked his 100th Sale appearance with a try. Pollard replied with a second penalty but there was no doubting that as half-time approached, it was the home side who were in the ascendancy. Despite struggling in the scrum for most of the first half, the outstanding Luke Cowan-Dickie\u2019s lineout was proving an effective weapon for Sale, and after another pinpoint delivery Bevan Rodd forced his way over to nudge the hosts ahead by a solitary point at the break. That was despite a 10-4 penalty count and a barrage of Leicester pressure; you felt if Sale turned it up a notch, they could pull away. That proved to be the case in emphatic fashion, with a blistering passage of play after half-time proving to be the catalyst for the Sharks\u2019 latest home success. \u201cWe were painting a bit of a bad picture in that first half and we knew we had the things to fix it,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cWe were a bit braver in attack and on transition, we leaned into our maul well and when you\u2019re doing that, it opens up elsewhere.\u201d A wonderful long-range try moved Sale further ahead as the hosts went from their own 22 to the tryline in just a handful of phases, with Arron Reed the beneficiary. The wing then scored again after marvellous vision from George Ford and Rob du Preez found him in open space to secure a bonus point before the 50th minute. It would get even better, too. Asher Opoku-Fordjour capped a wonderful week to score his first senior try a week after his England debut, as the forward spotted a gap in the Leicester defence to surge over and produce a huge roar from the home faithful, who were now sensing a crucial victory was well on the way to being secured. Freddie Steward\u2019s long-range try after an Olly Cracknell interception raised hopes of a losing bonus point but despite George Martin\u2019s late try nudging them even closer to that mark, they couldn\u2019t get the other try they needed, given how Cowan\u2011Dickie had marked another outstanding display with a try of his own. We may not have seen the best of Sale so far this season but this was a performance that will have put the Premiership\u2019s leading pack on notice as Christmas approaches.",

The move is dependent on the incumbent FBI chief, Christopher Wray, who Trump himself placed in the job in 2017, either being fired or resigning.</p> <p>It is already clear that confirming Patel through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate\">US Senate</a> is likely to be less than plain sailing. Mike Rounds, a Republican senator from South Dakota, indicated that Patel could face a tough confirmation battle.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/01/trump-picks-loyalist-kash-patel-to-run-fbi\">Trump picks loyalist Kash Patel to run FBI</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rounds pointedly sang the praises of the existing FBI director in an interview with ABC\u2019s This Week. He said that Wray, who still has three more years of his 10-year term to serve, was a \u201cvery good man\u201d, adding that he had \u201cno objections about the way that he is doing his job right now\u201d.</p> <p>The senator also emphasised the separation of powers between president and Senate, signaling possible trouble for Patel. Rounds said he gave presidents \u201cthe benefit of the doubt\u201d, but also emphasised that \u201cwe have a constitutional role to play \u2026 that\u2019s the process\u201d.</p> <p>Other Republican senators rallied to Patel\u2019s side. Ted Cruz, the senator from Texas, told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation that he believed Patel would be confirmed.</p> <p>\u201cPatel is a very strong nominee to take on the partisan corruption of the FBI.\u201d</p> <p>Bill Hagerty, a Republican senator from Tennessee, said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press that he would vote to confirm Patel. \u201cKash is the best at uncovering what\u2019s happened to the FBI and I look forward to seeing him taking it apart,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Patel is a Trump loyalist who has published children\u2019s books featuring \u201cKing Donald\u201d. He has long denigrated the FBI as a pillar of what he calls the \u201cdeep state\u201d or the \u201ccorrupt ruling class\u201d.</p> <p>In an interview with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjWCnh42Sc4\">Shawn Ryan</a> in September, Patel vowed to \u201cshut down\u201d the FBI\u2019s headquarters in Washington DC and reopen the building the following day as a \u201cmuseum of the deep state\u201d.</p> <p>He has also threatened to use the power of federal law enforcement to go after those he claims are responsible for corrupting the federal government, a list of whom he published in his memoir. Jake Sullivan, Joe Biden\u2019s current national security adviser, was among that list: Patel called him \u201cone of the corrupt actors of the first order\u201d.</p> <p>Sullivan was asked by ABC\u2019s This Week whether he was worried personally about Patel\u2019s potential leadership of the FBI, given the threats against him. He declined to comment, saying he was wholly focused on keeping the country safe in the remaining 50 days of his term in office.</p> <p>But he did highlight that Biden had kept Wray on as FBI chief, despite having inherited the official from Trump. Sullivan said that Wray served \u201cwith distinction, entirely insulated from politics or the partisan preferences of the current sitting president. This is a good, deep bipartisan tradition that President Biden has adhered to.\u201d</p> <p>Jamie Raskin, a House Democrat from Maryland, challenged the claim by Trump and Patel that the FBI had been politically weaponised under Biden to go after Republicans. He pointed out on CNN\u2019s State of the Union that over the past four years the FBI had prosecuted the disgraced Democratic senator from New Jersey, Bob Menendez, and the Texas Democrat Henry Cuellar.</p> <p>\u201cI think that\u2019s what they mean when they talk about politicization in the deep state \u2013 anybody who doesn\u2019t do the will of Donald Trump,\u201d Raskin said.</p> <p>According to an Axios report on Sunday, Trump had initially planned to appoint Patel as deputy FBI director but changed his mind after his pick to head the agency, the state attorney general of Missouri, Andrew Bailey, failed to impress him. Raising Patel to the number one position makes the move far more politically loaded.</p> <p>Despite the storm he is generating, Trump shows no sign of moderating his leadership choices for his upcoming administration.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s plan to nominate as FBI director the \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy theorist Kash Patel, a virulent critic of the bureau who has threatened to fire its top echelons and shut down the agency\u2019s headquarters, is facing blowback in Congress as US senators begin to flex their muscles ahead of a contentious confirmation process. Politicians from both main parties took to the Sunday talk shows to express starkly divergent views on Patel, whom Trump announced on Saturday as his pick to lead the most powerful law enforcement agency in the US. The move is dependent on the incumbent FBI chief, Christopher Wray, who Trump himself placed in the job in 2017, either being fired or resigning. It is already clear that confirming Patel through the US Senate is likely to be less than plain sailing. Mike Rounds, a Republican senator from South Dakota, indicated that Patel could face a tough confirmation battle. Rounds pointedly sang the praises of the existing FBI director in an interview with ABC\u2019s This Week. He said that Wray, who still has three more years of his 10-year term to serve, was a \u201cvery good man\u201d, adding that he had \u201cno objections about the way that he is doing his job right now\u201d. The senator also emphasised the separation of powers between president and Senate, signaling possible trouble for Patel. Rounds said he gave presidents \u201cthe benefit of the doubt\u201d, but also emphasised that \u201cwe have a constitutional role to play \u2026 that\u2019s the process\u201d. Other Republican senators rallied to Patel\u2019s side. Ted Cruz, the senator from Texas, told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation that he believed Patel would be confirmed. \u201cPatel is a very strong nominee to take on the partisan corruption of the FBI.\u201d Bill Hagerty, a Republican senator from Tennessee, said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press that he would vote to confirm Patel. \u201cKash is the best at uncovering what\u2019s happened to the FBI and I look forward to seeing him taking it apart,\u201d he said. Patel is a Trump loyalist who has published children\u2019s books featuring \u201cKing Donald\u201d. He has long denigrated the FBI as a pillar of what he calls the \u201cdeep state\u201d or the \u201ccorrupt ruling class\u201d. In an interview with Shawn Ryan in September, Patel vowed to \u201cshut down\u201d the FBI\u2019s headquarters in Washington DC and reopen the building the following day as a \u201cmuseum of the deep state\u201d. He has also threatened to use the power of federal law enforcement to go after those he claims are responsible for corrupting the federal government, a list of whom he published in his memoir. Jake Sullivan, Joe Biden\u2019s current national security adviser, was among that list: Patel called him \u201cone of the corrupt actors of the first order\u201d. Sullivan was asked by ABC\u2019s This Week whether he was worried personally about Patel\u2019s potential leadership of the FBI, given the threats against him. He declined to comment, saying he was wholly focused on keeping the country safe in the remaining 50 days of his term in office. But he did highlight that Biden had kept Wray on as FBI chief, despite having inherited the official from Trump. Sullivan said that Wray served \u201cwith distinction, entirely insulated from politics or the partisan preferences of the current sitting president. This is a good, deep bipartisan tradition that President Biden has adhered to.\u201d Jamie Raskin, a House Democrat from Maryland, challenged the claim by Trump and Patel that the FBI had been politically weaponised under Biden to go after Republicans. He pointed out on CNN\u2019s State of the Union that over the past four years the FBI had prosecuted the disgraced Democratic senator from New Jersey, Bob Menendez, and the Texas Democrat Henry Cuellar. \u201cI think that\u2019s what they mean when they talk about politicization in the deep state \u2013 anybody who doesn\u2019t do the will of Donald Trump,\u201d Raskin said. According to an Axios report on Sunday, Trump had initially planned to appoint Patel as deputy FBI director but changed his mind after his pick to head the agency, the state attorney general of Missouri, Andrew Bailey, failed to impress him. Raising Patel to the number one position makes the move far more politically loaded. Despite the storm he is generating, Trump shows no sign of moderating his leadership choices for his upcoming administration. Over the weekend he tapped Charles Kushner, father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner and a convicted felon whom Trump pardoned in 2020, as US ambassador to France. On Sunday, Trump announced on Truth Social that he had chosen his daughter Tiffany\u2019s father-in-law, Massad Boulos, to be senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs. Boulos, a Lebanese billionaire, was active in Trump\u2019s presidential campaign as a liaison with Arab American and Muslim leaders. Trump has also picked a county sheriff, Chad Chronister, from Florida to head the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The agency will have a key role in attempting to fulfill Trump\u2019s pledge to staunch the cross-border flow of fentanyl and other drugs into the US, which is already causing diplomatic tensions with Canada and Mexico. Chronister\u2019s father-in-law, Edward DeBartolo Jr, was pardoned by Trump three years ago on a 1998 conviction for involvement in a gambling fraud case. DeBartolo, the former owner of the San Francisco 49ers American football team, was fined $1m and suspended by the NFL for a year.",

But the quality of the other team...</p> <p>\u201cIf you want to win against City you have to be perfect in every part of the game. High press, low press, build-up. They bring so many problems to you. We came close to perfection, we weren\u2019t perfect but we came close to perfection. That\u2019s the only way to beat a quality team like City.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone, including me, would have predicted this [start]. I knew Jurgen [Klopp] left the team in a very good place. But still, to win so much with all the difficult teams we have played already is not something you could predict at the start of the season.</p> <p>\u201cBut, like I say, I saw Arsenal yesterday and Chelsea today and I saw City, they will come back because these teams have so much quality.

That\u2019s being stable.\u201d</p></li> <li><p>\u201cI always use this as an example: Romelu Lukaku, two minutes to go in the final of the Champions League. In the six-yard box in the middle with a header. He shoots into the knee of Ederson. And we won the Champions League. What a legend Pep is! What a team, personality, character!\u201d</p></li> <li><p>I want to be honest: the club needs this period. To realise what we have done and build for the future. It\u2019s so important. You have to lose sometimes. I don\u2019t like it. But it will be good for the club.\u201d</p></li> <li><p>\u201cBut knowing the reality and the team, we cannot make targets to win the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cups. It\u2019s unnecessary when in the last six games we have not been able to win one.\u201d</p></li> <li><p>\u201cIf Liverpool win, I would shake their hands. If Arsenal win with Mikel Arteta, I would be so happy for him. Believe me, truly, honestly. But I don\u2019t like not competing because the players I have are injured. But it is what it is.

Certain early-season matches \u2013 and this is still pretty early in the season \u2013 carry too much hype, but with Manchester City wobbling \u2013 and wibbling \u2013 and Liverpool flying, this is a huge match. Could the gap between the two be 11 whole points? That would be shades of 2019-20, when Liverpool stormed to the Premier League. All eyes on Pep Guardiola, who took head-scratching too far the other night, and whose media appearances since Tuesday\u2019s 3-3 draw with Feyenoord have held the look of a haunted man. Arne Slot has taken on the chilled-out entertainer role, cracking gags about Mo Salah when so many others are catastrophising, and his team look capable of several gears. City meanwhile, seem incapable of even grinding games out. They can\u2019t, though, afford to lose this, and the great teams will always find a way. Now is the time for them to be stand up and be counted. <br><br><strong>Kick-off is at 4pm UK time. Join me.</strong> </p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "That makes it 18 wins from 20 for Liverpool, a famous win, though one that was predictable. Manchester City\u2019s slide continues to amaze, though perhaps Liverpool\u2019s rise may one day supplant that. Thanks for reading today. Arne Slot spoke to Sky, too. \u201dIf you look at work-rate I think it was perfect. The amount of chances we miss made it tight at the end. But maybe that\u2019s nice for matches like this. It should be like this. But it would have been nicer to score the second goal earlier. \u201cWe always press high but they\u2019re so good at build-up. So you have to work very hard. Our players had energy. Apart from our players, the crowd was fantastic today as well. \u201cWe\u2019re a compatible team and it\u2019s difficult to beat us. But also we have to put the effort in. But we have injuries. We had to take Trent off. It would have been a risk. These are the challenges we face at the moment but every team has to face these challenges over a season. \u201cIdeally I would have loved to have seen the second half being the same as the first half. But the quality of the other team... \u201cIf you want to win against City you have to be perfect in every part of the game. High press, low press, build-up. They bring so many problems to you. We came close to perfection, we weren\u2019t perfect but we came close to perfection. That\u2019s the only way to beat a quality team like City. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone, including me, would have predicted this [start]. I knew Jurgen [Klopp] left the team in a very good place. But still, to win so much with all the difficult teams we have played already is not something you could predict at the start of the season. \u201cBut, like I say, I saw Arsenal yesterday and Chelsea today and I saw City, they will come back because these teams have so much quality. They could go on the same run as us. So we have to stay sharp and focused.\u201d Pep on those \u201csacked in the morning\u2019 chants, per Sky. \u201cI am here sitting as a manager and defending what we have done in the past thanks to them and more than ever I want to be with them and hug them. We have to change results and in the right time we will take the decision. \u201cAll the stadiums want to sack me, it started at Brighton! Maybe they are right with the results we\u2019ve been having. I didn\u2019t expect that at Anfield. They didn\u2019t do it at 1-0, but at 2-0. \u201cMaybe they should have sung it in the past. I didn\u2019t expect it from the people from Liverpool but it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s part of the game, and I understand completely. We\u2019ve had incredible battles together. I have a respect for them.\u201d Pep Guardiola has spoken to Sky: \u201cThe first 15-20 minutes they were unstoppable, they started so strong, we tried to play with a lot of control and passes, but it was difficult to take it. They deserved the first goal, but we started the first half so well and played well in the second half without too much threat. I know how strong Liverpool are in both boxes. \u201cI congratulate them and we\u2019ll reset and start from zero and it is difficult to believe it. I rely a lot on these players, I know they are doing in this position. We\u2019ll see what happens by the end of the season. \u201cWe can always do the short passes, and we can do it, but we don\u2019t have many alternatives. All I can say is thank you to them because I know the commitment that they showed with and without the ball. Maybe I had a feeling inside me that we will build from them. We will restart and try and make a good run.\u201d Here\u2019s David Hytner\u2019s report from Anfield. The City machine looks broken, the certainties that have driven them for so long absent, the control gone. They got exactly what they deserved here \u2013 another defeat, a sixth in seven matches in all competitions, and it is very difficult to see them defending their Premier League title. The delirious Liverpool crowd informed Guardiola that he would be sacked in the morning, which prompted him to raise six digits in their direction, one for each of his league titles in England. It was an isolated act of defiance from someone with the club\u2019s crest on their chest. The top of the table, with Manchester City in danger of dropping away. Philip in Anfield gets in touch, in response to AA BB: \u201cInterested to see that City\u2019s titles have Asterixes against them. Some think they should have hired Getafix as the lawyer, and others that O\u2019Veroptimistix is among those salivating over the charges. Pretty sure Cacofonix was sitting near me at the end.\u201d Enjoy the evening, Philip. Virgil van Dijk also spoke to Sky: \u201cI think City is a fantastic team. Four-time champions in a row. They have the quality to punish any team. But I think we were solid defensively and had great chances. We could have scored more. Good game. We won. And we move on. \u201cWe focus on the next game. That\u2019s the only thing we can do. There\u2019s no point at this stage of the season to get ahead of ourselves. Of course everybody wants to be in a position where they are 11 points ahead of their opponents. But there\u2019s so many twists and turns. We have injuries to our team unfortunately and we have to deal with that.\u201d Couple of stats from Opta: Manchester City have lost four consecutive Premier League matches for the first time since August 2008. Meanwhile, this is the first time in Pep Guardiola\u2019s managerial career that he has lost four consecutive league matches. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has won just six of his 23 games against Liverpool across all competitions (D8 L9). Of opponents he\u2019s faced more than five times in his managerial career, the Reds are the side he\u2019s won the lowest percentage of his games against (26%). Mohamed Salah just spoke to Sky, and there was mention of his contract. Could this be the last time against City? \u201cIt\u2019s very special. I don\u2019t take it for granted. I\u2019m enjoying every minute here. It feels like home. It\u2019s always special feeling always scoring at Anfield and winning games.\u201d \u201cHonestly it\u2019s in my head. Until now this is the last City game I will play for Liverpool so I was just going to enjoy it. The atmosphere was incredible so I will enjoy every second here. Hopefully we just win the league and will see what will happen.\u201d Gillian Kirby: \u201cIf Pep IS off, who are they replacing him with, though? Steve Cooper? Big Sam? A ghost?\u201d Niall Mullen (and many others): \u201cClassy from Pep to acknowledge Liverpool\u2019s six European Cups\u201d Today\u2019s other matches: Andy Flintoff gets in touch: \u201cIt is precisely that he has won so many titles (pending lawyerball) that means he is currently insulated from the sack. After a run of results like the one City is currently on, would any other top (or top-adjacent) team keep the manager?\u201d AA BB is back: \u201cI think it\u2019s age plus lawyerball. They can see they\u2019re going to have asterixes above a lot of the successes and it\u2019s draining. Pep dropping ederson is a bad management imo. \u201c Colum gets in touch: \u201cKelleher has had such an impact on Liverpool\u2019s series of wins on all fronts. Uneasy about the signing of Jaros as third keeper, the Irishman can contend for the spot of first choice goalie with Allison when the latter returns from injury with head held high. Saves fron the likes of Mbapp\u00e8 and De Bruyne. Doesn\u2019t get much better. What a statement from Liverpool!\u201d Liam McMahon: \u201cYou sure the Guardiola six gesture wasn\u2019t to indicate he\u2019s lost just about six games in a row? \u201c Behind their hands, Haaland and Van Dijk have quite the conversation. Amicable, it should be said. City\u2019s players go to the away fans \u2013 and are applauded. Pep does the six finger gesture to the away fans, too. He\u2019s the last to leave the field. This feels symbolic of something. He\u2019s clapping all ends of the stadium and smiling\u2026.he\u2019s not off, is he? You heard it here first. It could and should have been more. Liverpool peppered City in the first half, and Cody Gakpo\u2019s goal was meagre reward. If City improved in the second half, their ability to self-destruct continued, and so Mohamed Salah was able to slot the deciding penalty. That did for City, who look done. An 11-point gap. Arne Slot and Guardiola embrace \u2013 coolly. Pep leaves the field deep in thought but does offer congratulations. 90+2 min: Pep is rubbing his chin now \u2013 at least he isn\u2019t picking at his face \u2013 but he cuts a beaten, bemused figure. Just what is happening? 90+1 min: Luis Diaz departs, and on comes Harvey Elliott, and four minutes are added on. 90 minute: City have offered nothing beyond that Van Dijk slip. The ol\u00e9s ring out as Liverpool pass the ball around at will. It\u2019s almost cruel. 89 min: Pep was taking that six gesture out of the Mourinho playbook. 88 min: Pep is laughing, and smirking and then does a gesture to show he\u2019s won six titles. The seventh is surely beyond his team this season. 86 min: Anfield is full of song now. The job is almost done. And here comes the \u201csacked in the morning\u201d chants. That arl Scouse wit\u2026 84 min: Salah, the match-winner, departs the scene. Curtis Jones comes on as a closer. 83 min: Van Dijk, imperious all game, suddenly slips up, and De Bruyne has a chance to score. Kelleher makes a fine save and receives a vote of thanks from Van Dijk. 81 min: How did City become so vulnerable? It\u2019s an amazing \u2013 and welcome for many \u2013 development. This season was supposed to be about lawyerball not actual football. 80 min: City subs: Foden and Lewis off, De Bruyne and Grealish on. They will have to perform a miracle. Meanwhile, Salah and Silva tangle. Silva kicked Salah\u2019s hand. Petulance, yeah, that\u2019ll help. 79 min: Pep shakes his head. His team have played well in the second half. Nowhere near their best but something like their old selves. The defending, the composure for that penalty, was unacceptable at any level. Deep breath, and then slot to the bottom right. A fine penalty. City do it to themselves again. A total tangle, and Luis Diaz escapes after Nunez robs Walker. Ortega charges out and clatters the Colombian. Shades of Feyenoord in midweek. 74 min: Van Dijk wants this finished. He surges forward like Alan Hansen and sets up Nunez, who checks back and City clear. Quansah \u2013 in fact \u2013 is playing right-back. 72 min: Two Liverpool changes: Gakpo and Trent off, Quansah and Nunez on. Gomez will look after Doku. Quansah hasn\u2019t been seen since Portman Road when he got repeatedly rolled by Liam Delap. 70 min: Trent, this time, stops Doku, who is causing real problems. On the other flank, Savinho is doing similar, and as he checks and chips, Gomez clears. 68 min: Darwin Nunez is imminent. Meanwhile Doku spins and skins Trent, and it takes Van Dijk to stop it reaching Haaland. Within seconds Gakpo is going close at the other end. Liverpool retain their speed on the break. But have they lost their touch in front of goal? 67 min: Peter Oh gets in touch: \u201cRe: Pep\u2019s coin-toss mind games. City can run from the Kop, they can hide from the Kop, but eventually the Kop will get them.\u201d I have a feeling that was Kyle Walker\u2019s plan. 66 min: A rash of Liverpool attacks. Gakpo gets away, Salah veers offside, and Trent\u2019s shot, saved by Ortega, becomes moot. 64 min: Another centre-back \u2013 Ake \u2013 smashes it long for Haaland. Pep really is going old school. Brings a tear to the eye for the likes of Bassett, Kinnear, Beck, Taylor, Pulis, Warnock and Allardyce. They always knew. And now so does Pep. Haaland doesn\u2019t look like he fancies being the new Wayne Allison, mind. 63 min: Salah scoops one wide, having barrelled through. One thing about him: he\u2019s not afraid to miss. 62 min: Van Dijk reads an Akanji ball arrowing for Haaland. Great play from the Dutchman. 61 min: Liverpool attempt to pass it around, and advance forward. Szoboszlai has a shot blocked after Mac Allister\u2019s elegant turn and gallop. 59 min: Doku and Savinho \u2013 two wingers \u2013 Pep is going old-school. Rico Lewis appears to be pushed forward, too, released from what is now a back three. It may take a while to work out a revised formation. It\u2019s all City, Liverpool looking to the counter. 57 min: City subs; Savinho and Doku on, Gundogan and Nunes go off. Nunes was on a booking. 56 min: Akanji and Ake get in a tangle and Salah is through. He has company to pass to, too, and yet he shoots miles wide. He can\u2019t believe it, rubs his new hair in confusion\u2026.what a moment. 55 min: Walker and Silva almost combine to get away. Anfield now rings out\u2026their fans are encouraging the team on\u2026 53 min: On the sidelines, Pep and Juanma are back on speaking terms. And Nunes\u2019 high press almost robs an idling Gomez. City want \u2013 and deserve \u2013 a corner. 52 min: City look\u2026better. Nunes forces a corner. Their fans can be heard, too. Szoboszlai on Haaland is an odd pairing at corners but the danger is cleared. 51 min: Trent to take, Virgil van Dijk gets to it, escaping everyone, Gabriel-style. But the ball lands on the roof of the net. 50 min: Foden forces a corner, running down the channels. Is Pep going old school here? The big man to aim for is Haaland but Akanji heads over\u2026Liverpool spring forward, Robertson zings it to Gakpo, and Nunes makes a fine tackle. We\u2019re back on! 48 min: De Bruyne is now warming up. Maybe it ain\u2019t over till it\u2019s over. Still all City but very much sterile possession. 47 min: Rupak chips in: \u201cNo one can deny the role Klopp played in revamping this Liverpool squad. But my goodness, the clarity in decision making these players are showing, most of whom have arrived only last season, indicates how good Arne has slotted in.\u201d City are playing keep-ball. This is where Liverpool may have to suffer. 46 min: Now City attack the Kop. And there are boos as they maintain possession. In the UK, Sky keep showing clips of Pep\u2019s half-time team talks from last season. He talks so quickly, I\u2019d struggle, to be quite honest. Doku, Grealish, Savinho all warming up: no De Bruyne. Is it over for him at City? Will Liverpool rue not blowing City away? We\u2019re about to find out. Kari Tulinius gets in touch, too: \u201cAlexander-Arnold is an amazing player. His passes from deep land so smoothly, like he was chipping them from ten yards away. There\u2019s no player like him in the game today, it sounds ludicrous that it\u2019s really an open question whether he\u2019ll stay at Liverpool after this season. Though the idea of him passing to Mbapp\u00e9 and Vinicius has aesthetic appeal.\u201d You tease\u2026. Tim Pearson does, too: \u201cCity have the look of an aging heavyweight, returned for one too many paydays, hand speed gone, legs heavy and slow, granite jaw suddenly turned to glass. And that dazed, perplexed look as the young challenger\u2019s blows overwhelm what little wit and instinct he has left.\u201d Drew gets in touch: \u201cAlmost impossible to pick fault with Slot\u2019s Liverpool but they\u2019ve done a great job of quieting the crowd since that frenetic start. Surely a Klopp Liverpool would be 4-0 up by now\u2026 \u201c City will be glad that\u2019s over. Liverpool wanted more, much more. And remain capable of doing so. Liverpool did ebb as time has gone on. What can Pep conjure? This will have to be the team talk of a lifetime. 45_+1 min: Three minutes added on. Pep and Juanma are deep in discussion. 44 min: Salah hurt? Looks like he was stood on. The referee take no notice.Salahj gets up and is the target of a pass out to the wing. 43 min: City doing their best to calm the storm. Much more patient, better shape, Ortega ends up playing a pass to nobody. Liverpool can resume. 41 min: Applause as Liverpool play some Slot-ball. They only just fail to play in Diaz. 39 min: City\u2019s first shot? Robertson lets in Lewis and the ball is jabbed wide. Still. City are better at the moment. Much betterl. 38 min: A penalty claim? Nope. Diaz had fallen to the surface rather too easily. 37 min: Pep is pacing. His team attempt to work a set piece and Bernardo Silva can only lump the ball at Kelleher\u2026that\u2019s poor. 35 min: Gakpo barrels to the byline, but cannot find a teammate. City clear, and Gravenberch is booked for legging up Gundogan. Haaland was the next and willing recipient. 34 min: Close again! Mac Allister\u2019s corner is headed out, and Trent has yet another dig. It\u2019s something of a scuff but comes off the bottom of the post. 32 min: After the heavy metal thunder, back to the jazz rock. Though Foden shows punkish energy in pulling back Gravenberch. He\u2019s booked for a shirt pull. 31 min: Szoboszlai plays in Trent, whose wallop at goal hits the first man. 30 min: City finding the angles and seeing the pictures at last. Liverpool having to chase. Like old times? That City defence still looks wobbly. 28 min: Haaland is ordering his teammates to get in shape as Liverpool get the ball. A new leader emerging? 26 min: Gravenberch fouls Foden when Nunes was expectant. No yellow, when it might have been. City have a head of steam up, and are in possession, suddenly looking more comfortable. 25 min: Are City finding their feet?\u2026Anfield sounds anxious. 24 min: Lewis and Walker get in a terrible tangle. City clear and Nunes gets the sixth touch in the Liverpool final third. He then loses the ball and concedes a foul and a yellow. That too was sloppy. 23 min: Touches in final third 45-5. Can anyone remember the five from City? 22 min: Another corner. Alexander-Arnold takes from the left. More chaos, as cleared by Haaland in the end. 19 min: Close! Again! Trent on a weaving run leaves the ball to Gakpo and he smashes over. Arne Slot agonises. 18 min: Trent Alexander-Arnold lasers in a ball for Salah to chase and a corner is conceded. From that, Mac Allister takes and Van Dijk heads down and just wide. So that\u2019s Salah and Van Dijk at corners they are not marking? 17 min: AA BB gets in touch: \u201cInteresting that after winning the toss, pep chooses to switch sides from the traditional. I\u2019ve seen that a handful of times at anfield in massive games, Jose did it in that monumental 2005 CL tie. They want to get the kop out of the way asap.\u201d City did it in the 2013-14 game, as won by Coutinho (!?). The famous \u201dthis does not slip\u201d game. David Silva attacking the Kop was just amazing. 15 min: That was just brilliant from Salah, to open the floodgates. Foden will be OK to continue. But will his teammates? 14 min: City look beaten already. And worse, Phil Foden takes a knock after Gravenberch runs into the back of him. He looks in pain. There\u2019s discussions in the City team. Guardiola, well, all he can do is clap. Too easy, out to Salah, and his ball is a beauty, bisecting defenders and Ortega. Gakpo, at the back post, scores. 11 min: Liverpool go close twice! Szoboszlai forces a save from Ortega, and Van Dijk hits the crossbar. City can\u2019t sustain this for much longer. 10 min: Rick Harris gets in touch: \u201cLooking at the City team I have the overwhelming feeling that Pep will park the bus and hope that they can nick a goal on the break. Haven\u2019t seen the betting odds but I\u2019m guessing 0-0 must be heavily backed. These games are usually hyped to the rafters but rarely deliver. Let\u2019s hope I am wrong.\u201d Sitting back with this defence, is parking the Arkansas Chug-a-Bug, a cartoon car. 8 min: Gravenberch attempts to wiggle through. Then Robertson gallops on and his pass to the centre finds plenty of takers, too many, perhaps. City clear hurriedly. Ake slows play down by claiming a hand injury. 6 min: All Liverpool? Yes, so far. And nothing like the patient build-up under Slot. We are back and rocking in true heavy metal style. 5 min: City torn asunder, Gundogan loses it, ball out to Gakpo. He cuts in, and Ortega makes a save. There\u2019s an offside but City looked weak again. 4 min: Ake raps into Salah. Kelleher had given the ball directly to Salah. 2 min: A Liverpool attack of promise. Salah wafts the ball across goal but no takers. He and Trent Alexander-Arnold had made space rather easily. 1 min: Rico Lewis is on the right, doubling up ahead of Kyle Walker. Foden has an early skate through some red shirts but the ball goes back to Kelleher. Big, manly, if distant embrace between Arne and Pep. Arne had the bigger smile. The toss has meant that Liverpool will attack the Kop in the first half. Old-school stuff. OK, the teams are lined up, and Anfield rings out with songs. The City fans boo You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone. Sounds a heady mix of an atmosphere. Guardiola on the dropping of Ederson for Ortega. \u201cNo. We just wanted to change something. Eddy [Ederson] has saved a lot of goals for us. He\u2019s saved one-against-ones many, many times, but I decided to pick Stefan [Ortega] today. Both are incredibly top goalkeepers, they\u2019re both incredible with their feet and in one-v-ones. Since he arrived, we\u2019ve had incredible two goalkeepers.\u201d \u201cBasically, the players [who start] are more fit. That is the reason why. In the starting eleven, I could have changed a few other players. I know what Ruben [Dias] can give us in terms of leadership, but the other selections are about having more rhythm and more in the legs.\u201d Max Sanderson gets in touch: \u201cI have to say all this talk of Pep\u2019s impending day of reckoning hasn\u2019t sat quite right with me. One factor that has been overlooked is Phil Foden, who\u2019s obviously had a quiet year so far, but if he can find the pockets today, it could the impetus for City to turn their season around.\u201d Some highlights of that remarkable Sky interview with Guardiola: \u201cYou cannot imagine how much I get paid! It comes with my salary. If I don\u2019t want that pressure, I resign, go home and I don\u2019t have this weight on my shoulders. All the managers have that.\u201d \u201cHow you are in your thoughts when the opponent punches you in the face. That\u2019s being stable.\u201d \u201cI always use this as an example: Romelu Lukaku, two minutes to go in the final of the Champions League. In the six-yard box in the middle with a header. He shoots into the knee of Ederson. And we won the Champions League. What a legend Pep is! What a team, personality, character!\u201d I want to be honest: the club needs this period. To realise what we have done and build for the future. It\u2019s so important. You have to lose sometimes. I don\u2019t like it. But it will be good for the club.\u201d \u201cBut knowing the reality and the team, we cannot make targets to win the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cups. It\u2019s unnecessary when in the last six games we have not been able to win one.\u201d \u201cIf Liverpool win, I would shake their hands. If Arsenal win with Mikel Arteta, I would be so happy for him. Believe me, truly, honestly. But I don\u2019t like not competing because the players I have are injured. But it is what it is. It\u2019s life.\u201d Arne Slot has been speaking to the BBC: \u201cI think what we expect is what you always expect from City. They like to control the ball and possession. Maybe the difference between this [and normal] is [lack of] wingers. We have to wait and see in the first few minutes if they have changed anything in terms of formation. \u201cA bit of everything today. We\u2019d both like to have the ball. If you\u2019re sloppy [in a game like this] you have no chance. You have to be top on every aspect of your game. We have to be on top of our game in everything.\u201d \u201cI still had one choice to make. Five defenders for four positions going into a month like this is far from ideal. The injuries won\u2019t take one week. Dom played really well last week. We have four attackers available. Harvey Elliott is coming back and can help us.\u201d Jack Grealish, benched again, is meanwhile confined to saying \u201cMerry Football-darts-mas\u201d on Sky. Oh dear. A wide-ranging interview that Pep gave to Sky. To say he looks a bit jumpy may be understating it. Jose gets in touch: \u201cI just wanted to comment that in South America and south of Spain Diaz and Dias are pronounced in the same way but in the rest of Spain Diaz is pronounced like \u201cDiath\u201d. So we would say \u201cDiath\u201d for the Liverpool player and Dias for the Manchester City player.\u201d For Liverpool: Conor Bradley had his Mbappe moment but also got injured so a timely return for Trent Alexander-Arnold. Joe Gomez replaces Ibrahima Konate and Dominik Szoboszlai replaces Curtis Jones in midfield. For City: Ederson dropped, with Scott Carson on the bench too? Kyle Walker survives but Joso Gvardiol is also out. Ruben Dias is back. De Bruyne remains on the bench. Jack Grealish will also be riding pine. The teams are here: Liverpool: Kelleher, Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson, Gravenberch, Szoboszlai, Mac Allister, Salah, Nunez, Gakpo, Diaz. Subs: Jaros, Davies, Endo, Nunez, Jones, Elliott, Quansah, Morton, Nyoni. Manchester City XI: Ortega, Walker, Akanji, Dias, Ake, Lewis, Gundogan, Nunes, Silva, Foden, Haaland. Subs: Ederson, Carson, Grealish, Doku, De Bruyne, Gvardiol, Savinho, O\u2019Reilly, McAtee \u201cI don\u2019t sleep as good as when I won every game. I\u2019m the same person as four Premier Leagues in a row and in that situation, I have the same doubts. Now I want to be closer to the players, because I know they are suffering, I know they are thinking: \u2018Oh God, how we were not able to win that game against Feyenoord?\u2019 Or: \u2018Why don\u2019t we score when we had the chance to score against Spurs?\u2019 They are suffering. What can I do, blame them? Absolutely not.\u201d Plenty of previews for this game. Early team news Liverpool Subs from Jaros, Davies, Bradley, Gomez, Quansah, Endo, Elliott, Morton, Szoboszlai, Gakpo, Nyoni Doubtful Bradley (hamstring) Injured Konat\u00e9 (knee, unknown), Alisson (hamstring, 7 Dec), Jota (ribs, 7 Dec), Chiesa (muscle, 7 Dec), Tsimikas (ankle, unknown) Suspended None Form WWDWWW Leading scorer Salah 10 Manchester City Subs from Carson, Ortega, Wilson-Ebrand, McAtee, Perrone, Savinho, O\u2019Reilly, G\u00fcndogan, Simpson-Pusey, Nunes, Ak\u00e9 Doubtful Stones (unknown), Doku (hamstring) Injured Bobb (leg, 1 Jan), Rodri (knee, 1 Jun), Kovacic (unknown, 21 Dec) Suspended None Form WWWLLL Leading scorer Haaland 12 OK, this is massive. Certain early-season matches \u2013 and this is still pretty early in the season \u2013 carry too much hype, but with Manchester City wobbling \u2013 and wibbling \u2013 and Liverpool flying, this is a huge match. Could the gap between the two be 11 whole points? That would be shades of 2019-20, when Liverpool stormed to the Premier League. All eyes on Pep Guardiola, who took head-scratching too far the other night, and whose media appearances since Tuesday\u2019s 3-3 draw with Feyenoord have held the look of a haunted man. Arne Slot has taken on the chilled-out entertainer role, cracking gags about Mo Salah when so many others are catastrophising, and his team look capable of several gears. City meanwhile, seem incapable of even grinding games out. They can\u2019t, though, afford to lose this, and the great teams will always find a way. Now is the time for them to be stand up and be counted. Kick-off is at 4pm UK time. Join me.",

Of course, already yesterday in qualifying the car was a lot better, and today that first stint was very, very fast.

After that there were a few Safety Car moments that you had to take care, but very happy.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s been a while to be this competitive in the dry, and very proud of everyone in the team to turn it around within a day.

You just come out of the box and they\u2019re already cold and behind the Safety Car you can\u2019t warm them up. I tried something different out of the last corner, where I had no rear grip, so I just struggled for traction out of the corner.</p> \n   <p>It got a bit spicy into Turn 1 [against Norris] but I think that\u2019s great to see.

      "bodyText": "That is all from me today but here is Giles Richards\u2019 report in case you missed any of the action. Thanks for tuning in and join us next weekend for live updates on the final race of the season: the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Andrea Stella, the McLaren team principal has his say: Our overall result was affected dramatically with the penalty. On Oscar\u2019s side he did really well. Important points for him that keep a solid chance for the championship. It is the responsibility of the driver to recognise that they are in a yellow sector. At the same time, I find it particular that the yellow flag went up and then was removed even though the situation on the track was the same. The debris was the same. It was still on the track. Norris tells Sky Sports he \u201cdoes not know what I did wrong\u201d. Apparently I didn\u2019t slow under the yellow. I am not an idiot. If I saw a yellow, I would have slowed down. The rule is you have to slow down under the yellow, so it is a fair penalty. The team gave me a great car today, so I\u2019m thankful for the team. Disappointed that I couldn\u2019t have done a worse job than I did today, and not give them the points they deserved. So I\u2019ve made the job of the team much harder than it needs to be. The team are doing a great job but I\u2019ve let them down. Verstappen after his victory: It was a very good race. Of course, already yesterday in qualifying the car was a lot better, and today that first stint was very, very fast. Lando and I were within 1.8sec of each other the whole time, pushing each other and it was a lot of fun out there. This track has a lot of grip and this year the tires were really holding on, so that was a lot of fun to be really pushing. We went really long on that first stint. After that there were a few Safety Car moments that you had to take care, but very happy. It\u2019s been a while to be this competitive in the dry, and very proud of everyone in the team to turn it around within a day. So they definitely also deserve this victory. On the hard tires there is very little grip. You just come out of the box and they\u2019re already cold and behind the Safety Car you can\u2019t warm them up. I tried something different out of the last corner, where I had no rear grip, so I just struggled for traction out of the corner. It got a bit spicy into Turn 1 [against Norris] but I think that\u2019s great to see. And then after that we drove it to the end with good pace, so very happy to win here. The last three years we\u2019ve always been quite competitive there [Abu Dhabi] so I hope we can be competitive there again but we will pay attention to detail to try and optimise the car and hopefully we can fight for a win there again. Leclerc on the race and Ferrari\u2019s chances for the Constructors\u2019 Championship: I would have signed straight away a paper that told me we would have finished second on this track after a weekend like this because our car characteristics were not fitting very well with this track. We knew it was going to be a very difficult weekend compared to McLaren but in the end we managed to take some point away from them so the fight will be all the way to the last race in Abu Dhabi next week. It\u2019s difficult to know [how fast Ferrari will be]. We are all very close. It\u2019s going to be very tight but it\u2019s exciting. Everything is possible and we will give it [our] all. The Constructors\u2019 Championship will go down to the wire. McLaren will head to Abu Dhabi 21 points ahead of Ferrari. McLaren \u2013 640 Ferrari \u2013 619 Red Bull \u2013 581 Piastri on making the podium but the disappointing result for McLaren: It was a tricky race. The cars at the front seemed to have very similar pace too each other and it was really tough to make the inroads to get into DRS, and then far enough into DRS to overtake. A couple of good moments with Charles out there and nice to end up on the podium, but not quite the result we were looking for. Not sure what Lando\u2019s penalty was for, but obviously quite a big one. It\u2019s going to be an exciting end to the year. Hopefully we can be strong but it\u2019s going to take everything we\u2019ve got to seal the deal. The track is one of the most fun of the year so it was a fun race, just didn\u2019t enjoy the result. Russell, who was on pole, gets a time penalty but it does not affect his standing his finish of fourth. Gasly manages to keep at bay Sainz for fifth and Zhou finishes eighth and ends Sauber\u2019s points drought. No surprise here! Verstappen led from the moment he bypassed Russell right at the start. He has read the race really well and showcases why he is deservedly this season\u2019s championship with his ninth win of the year. Leclerc and Piastri secure podium spots in second and third. Lap 55/57: Hamilton gets past Lawson and Norris is now up to to 10th. Russell has now been noted for a safety car infringement. Lap 53/57: As it stands the Constructors\u2019 Championship will be decided in Abu Dhabi. Lap 52/57: Tsunoda is struggling with his tires as Norris passes him. Alonso is getting close to Sainz in sixth. Verstappen may be well in the lead but plenty of competition behind him. Lap 51/57: Magnussen speeds past Albon frustratingly to go up to ninth. Norris overtakes Lawson and is now in 13th. He is about three seconds faster than the cars in front of him so he can still get a point out of this race. Lap 49/57: Hamilton wants to park the car and retire in his second-last race for Mercedes but he is being told no. Everything that has gone wrong for him in this race (and weekend) has. He is now in last place behind Norris. Lap 46/57: Norris is now in last place due to the penalty. Verstappen, Leclerc and Piastri now the top three. Hamilton now has a drive through penalty now for speeding in the pit lane. Lap 44/57: Norris gets a 10 stop and go penalty for that yellow flag incident which he needs to serve within three laps. Seems a bit extreme but I guess it is a safety issue. Lap 43/57: Everyone is weaving to get some heat in their tires. A less exciting start than the last one as Verstappen speeds away. Norris is under a bit of pressure from Leclerc but he forces him wide. Lap 42/57: Norris is now officially under investigation for not slowing down for the yellow flags. That could be a time penalty. Hamilton tells his engineer that his car is \u201cmessed up\u201d. Safety car is about to end. Lap 41/57: P\u00e9rez might have actually not been hit. Could be a hydraulics issue. We tune into the radio to get some insight, but all he does is swear. Fair enough. Lap 40/57: The safety car ends. Verstappen under pressure and Norris is on the outside but the Red Bull driver is able to escape the wheel-to-wheel. Wow! P\u00e9rez lost drive and gets hit at Turn 15. H\u00fclkenberg is also out and \u2026 the safety car is back out again. That did not last long. Lap 39/57: Alonso pits for mediums and goes wheel-to-wheel with Magnussen before squeezing ahead. It will be looked at if it was safe enough got him to do that in the pit lane. Verstappen asks if Norris will be punished for not lifting while the yellow flags were out. Lap 38/57: Norris says Hamilton is speeding while the safety car is out. Lap 38/57: The safety car goes through the pit lane to give a chance for the debris to be cleared away. Lap 37/57: Russell: \u201cWhy have we put the hards on? Why have we put the fucking hards on? They\u2019re shit!\u201d Lap 35/57: We now have a safety car out. About five laps too late. The debris has at least ruined two drivers\u2019 races. Hamilton says: \u201cTrust me to have this luck.\u201d Lap 34/57: Bottas has just gone over the mirror and there are still no yellow flags. A ton of debris from the mirror is on the straight and now Hamilton and Sainz now both have punctures because of it. A disaster. Lap 32/57: So strange they haven\u2019t moved the mirror. It is on the straight which is the only place where someone can overtake another. Lap 31/57: Norris asks for where to go against Verstappen and all he gets in response is to speak louder. No answer to his question. Lap 30/57: We get two yellow flags in a row as someone has lost a wing mirror. It is just there in the middle of the straight. I believe it is Albon\u2019s. Still no word on a safety car so that marshalls can come in and get it. Lap 29/57: Russell tries to make a move on Alonso but he backs off immediately. He just can\u2019t seem to get the speed on his new tires. Lap 28/57: Alonso is keeping Russell at bay as Magnussen pits. Hamilton is sliding around now and he snaps which costs him a bit of time, as he remains in seventh. Lap 27/57: Russell is waiting for his tires to get up to temperature. Hamilton says his car is beginning to turn and both Verstappen and Norris are somehow going quicker on the old tires. Lap 23/57: Piastri is doing everything to get past Russell, even at the detriment of his tires. And the Mercedes driver is struggling a bit as he is in the pit and on go the hard tires. He was stationary in there for about seven seconds \u2013 way too lengthy. It costs him several places and gives an opening for Ferrari. The replay shows that they struggled to get one of the rear wheels off. Lap 22/57: Bottas is all by himself and he goes wide. All because of the lack of grip that all the drivers are somewhat struggling with. Lap 19/57: Hamilton is shocked when he is told about the the top six\u2019s pace compared to his own. \u201cMid 25s?! That\u2019s a second [faster]!\u201d Lap 18/57: Verstappen now marks the fastest lap in response. Norris now back to two seconds behind, Russell over four seconds in third. Lap 17/57: Leclerc asks for a check on his tire pressure, saying that there are likely to be punctures but he is told that it is all good for now. He clearly feels he is being aggressive on the turns. Lap 16/57: Norris again races the fastest lap. Gap between first and second is now around 1.6. Lap 15/47: Zhou also passes Tsunoda. He of course does not have a contract for next season. Tsunoda is struggling, though. He tells his team that he is pushing 100% and he gets a reply to hang in there. Lap 14/57: Huge from Alonso! Beautifully navigates around Tsunoda when staying on the track to get to 11th. Confirmed that Hamilton gets a five second penalty. Lap 13/57: On Norris\u2019s radio, we hear his team say that Verstappen\u2019s tires are in the same condition as his and Russell\u2019s are a bit worse off. Lap 12/57: Magnussen goes ahead of Tsunoda. Lap 11/57: Norris has now the fastest lap but Verstappen is still just under two seconds ahead of him. Lap 10/57: Stroll has officially retired. He rejoined just so he can serve the 10 second penalty so that it would not affect him in a future race. Lap 9/57: Hamilton has now officially been noted for a false start. That is usually a five second penalty. The replay shows that it is tight and he does apologise on the radio. He is currently in 8th. Lap 8/57: Alonso is not happy. He swears on the radio, saying that there is issues on the straights. And an incident for him has been noted for rejoining the track unsafely. He might be in trouble for that. Lap 7/57: Huge gaps between Verstappen, Norris and Russell. Stroll retired but then he rejoins the race. Lap 6/57: Lawson spins off as he tries to get past Bottas. Lawson lost grip and starting spinning. Lap 5/57: Verstappen opens up the gap between him and Norris. Piastri manages fourth from Leclerc \u2013 big for McLaren\u2019s chances in securing the Constructors\u2019 Championship today. Lap 4/57: The safety car is ending \u2026 we have only had about half a lap of racing but here we go. Lap 3/57: Safety car is still out. There are murmurings on the grid about Hamilton and if he made a false start but nothing official yet. Hugh gets in touch by email: That was weak by Lando. Roles reversed and Verstappen, quite rightly, would have cut straight across him and taken the inside of turn 1. Far too polite. Still confused myself as to why he backed off! Did he feel something in his car? Or was he thinking Verstappen would push him off. Very strange. Lap 2/57: Safety car remains out as we catch some replays of the crashes and the leaders in the race. Norris looked to creep to first on turn one but he backed off a bit as Verstappen came through. Stroll has had to pitt to change tires. Lap 1/57: Russell is on the outside line to start. The track temperature is only 23 C, a lot cooler than previous years. Verstappen swoops in and takes the lead within the first turn and Norris speeds to second. Safety car comes out after Colapinto and Ocon, the 16th crash for Williams this season. H\u00fclkenberg also had an incident and he has continued but his rim is popping out of his car. Off they go for the formation lap! We are underway at the Lusail International Circuit. We are a couple minutes away from lights out in Lusail. We have just heard of from the national anthem performed by the Qatar Music Academy Choir. Here is our starting grid. George Russell \u2013 Mercedes Max Verstappen \u2013 Red Bull Lando Norris \u2013 McLaren Oscar Piastri \u2013 McLaren Charles Leclerc \u2013 Ferrari Lewis Hamilton \u2013 Mercedes Carlos Sainz \u2013 Ferrari Fernando Alonso \u2013 Aston Martin Sergio P\u00e9rez \u2013 Red Bull Kevin Magnussen \u2013 Haas Pierre Gasly \u2013 Alpine Renault Zhou Guanyu \u2013 Sauber Valtteri Bottas \u2013 Sauber Yuki Tsunoda \u2013 RB Honda Lance Stroll \u2013 Aston Martin Alexander Albon \u2013 Williams Liam Lawson \u2013 RB Honda Nico Hulkenberg \u2013 Haas Franco Colapinto \u2013 Williams Esteban Ocon \u2013 Alpine Renault The Red Bull team principal Christian Horner tells Sky Sports that George Russell was speeding himself during the sprint, and likens it to a \u201cfootball player taking a dive in the penalty box\u201d. \u201cNot quite sure why we ended up with a one place penalty but if Max needed any extra motivation it has given him it for this. He is wound up for this one.\u201d Our first email of the day! Louise writes: What is your opinion on Verstappen\u2019s punishment? Both Verstappen and Russell were in a \u2018slow\u2019 lap. Normally, you would try to get some clean air in front of you just before starting a fast lap. You can see there is another driver in front of Verstappen and Russell is speeding. It feels like this was a mistake by the race engineers, not telling them what happened, not a drivers mistake? Verstappen said he was preparing his fast lap and suddenly saw Russell on his tail. The other driver was Fernando Alonso and you are right, he was going the exact same speed as well. Verstappen kept the same distance through both turns, he did not just decide to brake right as he was turning a corner. Certainly bizzare and I think that is why they minimised the penalty for Verstappen. Usually this situation would be a three-place grid penalty. McLaren could clinch their first Constructors\u2019 Championship since 1998 today if they: Outscore Ferrari by 15 points or more if they do not win the race or outscore Ferrari by 14 points if they do win the race. Not be outscored by Red Bull by 23 points or more. A look back on how Verstappen became the 2024 champion. Max Verstappen speaking to Sky Sports on qualifying and his penalty: Qualifying was very positive. The car seems to be working a bit better. I hope in the race we can be competitive and fight up front. We will try to fight for the win. I am one place back but let\u2019s see how it goes. The FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem has told Formula One drivers to mind their own business after they asked where money from race fines was going and why senior figures had left the governing body. In an interview before today\u2019s race, Ben Sulayem suggested the drivers should stick to what they know best. \u201cDo we have to tell them? When something in the teams changes, do they tell us?\u201d Ben Sulayem said when asked about the surprise departure of the race director Niels Wittich before last weekend\u2019s title-deciding Las Vegas Grand Prix. \u201cWe have the rules, we follow our rules. We don\u2019t follow someone else\u2019s rule. Simple as this.\u201d Wittich has said he did not resign and the FIA have given no public explanation as to why he suddenly left beyond saying it was to pursue new opportunities. Media reports have said he was sacked. The Mercedes driver George Russell, a director of the Grand Prix Drivers\u2019 Association (GPDA), said on Thursday drivers wanted clarity and understanding \u201cof what\u2019s going on and who\u2019s getting fired next\u201d. Ben Sulayem, a former rally driver who was elected as FIA head in 2021, responded: \u201cDo we tell them how to drive? Do we tell them what to have as their strategy? It\u2019s none of their business. Sorry \u2026 I am a driver. I respect the drivers. Let them go and concentrate on what they do best, which is race.\u201d The GPDA issued a remarkable statement last month, in response to an FIA clampdown on swearing, in which they asked Ben Sulayem to treat them like adults and mind his own language towards them. They also requested financial transparency and said all stakeholders, including drivers and teams, should jointly determine how and where the money from fines was spent \u2013 with some suggesting it could help fund professional stewards. \u201cThey talk and then they say, where are you putting the money? Why we don\u2019t do this? I don\u2019t say \u2018Oh, sorry, what about you?\u2019\u201d said Ben Sulayem. \u201cThe drivers are getting over 100m. Do I ask where they spend it? No. It\u2019s up to them. It\u2019s their right \u2026 we do whatever we do with the money. It\u2019s our business. It\u2019s also with them and their money. It\u2019s their business.\u201d Ben Sulayem said the drivers had his mobile number and he had nothing to hide. He said he \u201clived free of charge\u201d in the brains of critics in the media and did not need them or care what people said. He also rejected any suggestion that the FIA was in crisis and suffering a staff exodus under his leadership. Despite his \u201cnone of your business\u201d stance, the Emirati said later that \u20ac10.3m had been invested in grassroots single-seater racing last year. \u201cYou really think I would waste the money? This is not commercial. This is the money of the members, and I have been elected to safeguard that,\u201d he said. He added that 64 employees had joined the FIA in 2023 and 92 in 2024. \u201cI have been elected to fix the FIA. and I am fixing it. I am very happy with our new team. Very happy. I inherited an FIA with an operating cost of \u20ac23m. And where is it now? This will be the first year that we are plus.\u201d Reuters Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen may already be our 2024 Formula One champion but the fight for second in the drivers\u2019 standings and top honors in the constructors\u2019 standings is still very much alive in the second to last race of the season. Mercedes\u2019 George Russell will start from pole position in Qatar after Verstappen was given a one-place grid penalty for impediment during qualifying. In the final laps of qualifying, Verstappen slowed in the third sector, forcing Russell onto gravel. Verstappen\u2019s alleged offence was \u201cdriving unnecessarily slowly\u201d and after Russell gave his version of events, a decision was communicated more than three hours after the end of the session. It wouldn\u2019t be F1 without drama, right? Verstappen\u2019s points tally is 404 points. McLaren\u2019s Lando Norris is second with 347 points and Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc is third with 323 points. For constructors, McLaren leads with 623 points. Ferrari is second with 593 points and Red Bull is third with 556 points.

      "body": "<p>Max Verstappen without doubt delivered a fine drive for victory at the Qatar Grand Prix but the reverberations from this dead rubber in the desert will resound long after the anthems faded into the night. Controversy and potential danger marked the meeting at the Lusail circuit, bringing recent decisions made by Formula One\u2019s governing body, the FIA, sharply into scrutiny on the same day its president, Mohammed Ben Sulayem, had demanded drivers mind their own business when questioning his governance.</p> \n<p>Verstappen was in imperious form at Lusail in a race peppered with safety car interventions that he handled with aplomb and while being hounded throughout by a charging Lando Norris, who stayed within two seconds of the Dutchman until he received a penalty that took him out of contention.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/01/max-verstappen-accuses-george-russell-of-trying-to-screw-him-over-at-qatar-gp\">Max Verstappen accuses George Russell of \u2018trying to screw him over\u2019 at Qatar GP</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Behind the world champion Charles Leclerc was second for Ferrari and Oscar Piastri third, while his McLaren teammate Norris endured a torrid afternoon, relegated from \u00adsecond to last with a 10-second stop-go penalty for failing to slow under double yellow flags. While he came back to finish 10th the likely prospect of a tight fight to the flag with Verstappen was ended after his penalty, which he accepted, given he had not lifted off. Ultimately it was enough to ensure the constructors\u2019 championship between the two teams will now go to the wire at next weekend\u2019s season finale in Abu Dhabi.</p> \n<p>Yet what had been much of a procession for the first half with Verstappen leading from Norris, the top 10 largely circling line astern from one another in a laborious exercise in tyre management was turned by a debatable decision by the FIA race director.</p> \n<p>Just after the halfway point an errant wing mirror, dislodged from Alex Albon\u2019s Williams, was left on track toward the end of the start-finish straight in the braking zone but nothing was done about it for three laps. It was patently in a \u00adposition where it could be hit by cars and considered enough of an issue to be marked by yellow flags.</p> \n<p>Yet as they continued to cycle round past it and race control still did not intervene, it was inevitably shifted by being crushed into pieces by Valtteri Bottas\u2019s Sauber. Immediately afterwards both Lewis Hamilton and Carlos Sainz picked up punctures, almost certainly from the debris, raising serious questions as to why the race had not been \u00adneutralised to allow marshals to remove it sooner.</p> \n<p>The incident once more puts the spotlight on the FIA, given it comes so soon after the former race \u00addirector <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/12/fia-surprised-by-unexpected-departure-of-f1-race-director-before-end-of-2024-season\">Niels Wittich was replaced</a> with just three races remaining. He has since said he did not resign and it is reported he was sacked. Wittich was replaced by Rui Marques, who was previously the race director for Formula Two and Formula Three but the timing of the change, with three complex races remaining and an inexperienced race director in place, was questioned by drivers and teams alike.</p> \n<p>The FIA made no comment on why Wittich had been replaced but over recent weeks frustration with the governing body has been \u00adincreasing. This weekend Mercedes\u2019 George Russell, a director of the Grand Prix Drivers\u2019 Association had demanded \u201cclarity and understanding of what is going on and who is getting fired next\u201d. A comment which was met on Sunday with a dismissive \u00adrebuttal by Ben Sulayem. \u201cDo we tell them how to drive? Do we tell them what to have as their strategy? It\u2019s none of their business,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>However the president will nonetheless be under even further pressure to explain the circumstances of Wittich\u2019s departure after the events at the Lusail circuit which could have caused a serious accident and the apparent indecision, given as soon as the punctures occurred the safety car was immediately called to deal with the debris. The FIA have stated they will issue an explanation of the decisions made by race control on Monday.</p> \n<p>Piastri felt it should have been dealt with sooner. \u201cBeing in the braking zone for turn one where you are trying to overtake, I don\u2019t know what we were going to do until someone hit it,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving it sit there for 30&nbsp;laps of the race would not have been very smart. It probably should have been [moved] a bit earlier.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you\u2019re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The final result however was a major score for Ferrari who expected to be beaten by McLaren here. It takes the constructors\u2019 championship to the season finale with Norris\u2019s penalty costing McLaren dear and considered very severe. McLaren are looking to claim their first title since 1998 and remain favourites but Ferrari have now closed the gap to 21 points with 44 on offer in Abu Dhabi.</p> \n<p>Behind all of which furore, Hamilton, in his penultimate race for Mercedes, toiled fruitlessly. He was flagged for a false start and took a five-second penalty. Struggling with the balance of the car all race, he had the puncture and then received a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane. The driver, thoroughly fed-up, asked to retire his car but the team insisted he stick at it, which will not have improved his mood and he finished 12th. McLaren and Ferrari will go into the finale fired up but Hamilton can only hope his farewell is of finer stuff.</p> \n<p>Russell was in fourth for Mercedes, Pierre Gasly fifth for Alpine, Sainz sixth for Ferrari, Fernando Alonso seventh for Aston Martin, Guanyu Zhou eighth for Sauber and Kevin Magnussen ninth for Haas.</p>",

Verstappen was in imperious form at Lusail in a race peppered with safety car interventions that he handled with aplomb and while being hounded throughout by a charging Lando Norris, who stayed within two seconds of the Dutchman until he received a penalty that took him out of contention. Behind the world champion Charles Leclerc was second for Ferrari and Oscar Piastri third, while his McLaren teammate Norris endured a torrid afternoon, relegated from second to last with a 10-second stop-go penalty for failing to slow under double yellow flags. While he came back to finish 10th the likely prospect of a tight fight to the flag with Verstappen was ended after his penalty, which he accepted, given he had not lifted off. Ultimately it was enough to ensure the constructors\u2019 championship between the two teams will now go to the wire at next weekend\u2019s season finale in Abu Dhabi. Yet what had been much of a procession for the first half with Verstappen leading from Norris, the top 10 largely circling line astern from one another in a laborious exercise in tyre management was turned by a debatable decision by the FIA race director. Just after the halfway point an errant wing mirror, dislodged from Alex Albon\u2019s Williams, was left on track toward the end of the start-finish straight in the braking zone but nothing was done about it for three laps. It was patently in a position where it could be hit by cars and considered enough of an issue to be marked by yellow flags. Yet as they continued to cycle round past it and race control still did not intervene, it was inevitably shifted by being crushed into pieces by Valtteri Bottas\u2019s Sauber. Immediately afterwards both Lewis Hamilton and Carlos Sainz picked up punctures, almost certainly from the debris, raising serious questions as to why the race had not been neutralised to allow marshals to remove it sooner. The incident once more puts the spotlight on the FIA, given it comes so soon after the former race director Niels Wittich was replaced with just three races remaining. He has since said he did not resign and it is reported he was sacked. Wittich was replaced by Rui Marques, who was previously the race director for Formula Two and Formula Three but the timing of the change, with three complex races remaining and an inexperienced race director in place, was questioned by drivers and teams alike. The FIA made no comment on why Wittich had been replaced but over recent weeks frustration with the governing body has been increasing. This weekend Mercedes\u2019 George Russell, a director of the Grand Prix Drivers\u2019 Association had demanded \u201cclarity and understanding of what is going on and who is getting fired next\u201d. A comment which was met on Sunday with a dismissive rebuttal by Ben Sulayem. \u201cDo we tell them how to drive? Do we tell them what to have as their strategy? It\u2019s none of their business,\u201d he said. However the president will nonetheless be under even further pressure to explain the circumstances of Wittich\u2019s departure after the events at the Lusail circuit which could have caused a serious accident and the apparent indecision, given as soon as the punctures occurred the safety car was immediately called to deal with the debris. The FIA have stated they will issue an explanation of the decisions made by race control on Monday. Piastri felt it should have been dealt with sooner. \u201cBeing in the braking zone for turn one where you are trying to overtake, I don\u2019t know what we were going to do until someone hit it,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving it sit there for 30 laps of the race would not have been very smart. It probably should have been [moved] a bit earlier.\u201d The final result however was a major score for Ferrari who expected to be beaten by McLaren here. It takes the constructors\u2019 championship to the season finale with Norris\u2019s penalty costing McLaren dear and considered very severe. McLaren are looking to claim their first title since 1998 and remain favourites but Ferrari have now closed the gap to 21 points with 44 on offer in Abu Dhabi. Behind all of which furore, Hamilton, in his penultimate race for Mercedes, toiled fruitlessly. He was flagged for a false start and took a five-second penalty. Struggling with the balance of the car all race, he had the puncture and then received a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane. The driver, thoroughly fed-up, asked to retire his car but the team insisted he stick at it, which will not have improved his mood and he finished 12th. McLaren and Ferrari will go into the finale fired up but Hamilton can only hope his farewell is of finer stuff. Russell was in fourth for Mercedes, Pierre Gasly fifth for Alpine, Sainz sixth for Ferrari, Fernando Alonso seventh for Aston Martin, Guanyu Zhou eighth for Sauber and Kevin Magnussen ninth for Haas.",

In that time, 6,288 people crossed the Channel, compared with 768 over the same period last year. The data will be used by the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, to explain why the number of crossings by small boats carrying people seeking refuge has jumped in recent weeks. After a fortnight when bad weather prevented any crossings, two dinghies reached UK waters after midnight on Saturday with a combined total of 122 people onboard. This took the number of people who have arrived since 4 July to 20,110. It comes as Cooper prepares to make a statement to the House of Commons on a deal she signed last week with the Iraqi government on joint cooperation to tackle people-smuggling gangs and increase returns of rejected claimants. According to Home Office data covering 11 October to 10 November, 26 of the 31 days were classified as \u201cred\u201d, compared with just three over the same dates in 2023. When the Conservative government left office, 2024 was on track to be the busiest ever year for small boat arrivals, with 13,574 people crossing the Channel in the six months leading up to the election. That was almost 19% more than the 11,433 who crossed in the same period in 2023, 5% more than the 12,900 in the previous record year of 2022, and more than double the 6,594 in 2021. In her statement to the Commons on Monday, Cooper is expected to contrast the government\u2019s strategy with the record of her predecessors, who she will say lost control of every aspect of the immigration and asylum system, from small boat arrivals and asylum hotel costs to the total levels of net migration. It took about eight and a half months for arrivals to pass 20,000 after Rishi Sunak became prime minister. His tenure began in the autumn, meaning his first few months in power coincided with winter weather conditions when typically fewer crossings take place. By contrast, Starmer took on the role in the middle of the summer period when crossings are usually at their most numerous amid spells of better weather. It has taken about five months for arrivals to pass 20,000 since he came to power. A Labour source said: \u201cRobert Jenrick told the truth last week. He said the Tory party\u2019s \u2018handling of immigration let the country down badly\u2019 and \u2018caused immense and lasting harm\u2019. We will not repeat those same mistakes.\u201d The government minister Pat McFadden told Sky News\u2019 Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips that the UK \u201cwill always need migration\u201d but that it had to be balanced with training the British workforce so \u201cyou\u2019re not over-reliant on immigration\u201d. He said Labour would not be setting net migration targets but would publish a plan next week to reduce legal and illegal migration. The Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, admitted on Wednesday that previous Tory governments had failed to keep their promises on immigration, and she pledged to launch a radical review of Tory immigration policies. Figures from the Office for National Statistics on Thursday showed that net migration ballooned to 906,000 in 2023.",

A new kind of fear took over, that of the unknown. \u201cWe felt completely lost,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>In the darkness of the early hours on Saturday, the streets of Syria\u2019s second city were empty apart from uniformed fighters largely from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), who roamed Aleppo\u2019s sweeping plazas and gathered under its ancient citadel. They <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/29/syrian-rebels-launch-surprise-attack-on-aleppo\">rapidly seized control</a> of much of the city with little resistance from government forces.</p> \n<p>Within hours, the second largest city in Syria was suddenly under the control of militant Islamists, as shocked residents reeled from the rapid withdrawal of government troops loyal to Damascus. They remained unsure what life would be like under the militants\u2019 newfound rule.</p> \n<p>Fearing reprisals by Damascus, Nasma and her family frantically packed their bags and readied themselves to flee. She was proud of never having left Aleppo, not after the popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011 spilled into a bloody civil war; not after her home town was gripped by fierce street battles in which rebel fighters pushed for control of every inch of territory while Russian airstrikes pummelled the city.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"94c2fbf5-ce79-417f-a472-9b57b0e58e95\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4NaFx97GkEI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>They had opted to stay after Assad regained control of Aleppo in 2016. This moment threatened to be different.

      "bodyText": "It was 2am on Saturday when Nasma\u2019s husband told her there were uniformed fighters in their neighbourhood of western Aleppo \u2013 but they were not from the Syrian army. He stood on their balcony to get a better view, before the men told him to go back indoors. News of the militias\u2019 advance in the countryside around Aleppo had spread fast, although Nasma \u2013 who requested a pseudonym for her safety \u2013 didn\u2019t believe that change was coming until she saw displaced people arriving in the city from surrounding villages. \u201cWe had lost hope of something like this ever happening, so we refused to believe it at first, and the main reason for our disbelief was fear,\u201d she said. \u201cIt felt like a distant dream.\u201d Then the militants crossed into Aleppo city. \u201cAt that moment we realised this time was different,\u201d Nasma said. A new kind of fear took over, that of the unknown. \u201cWe felt completely lost,\u201d she said. In the darkness of the early hours on Saturday, the streets of Syria\u2019s second city were empty apart from uniformed fighters largely from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), who roamed Aleppo\u2019s sweeping plazas and gathered under its ancient citadel. They rapidly seized control of much of the city with little resistance from government forces. Within hours, the second largest city in Syria was suddenly under the control of militant Islamists, as shocked residents reeled from the rapid withdrawal of government troops loyal to Damascus. They remained unsure what life would be like under the militants\u2019 newfound rule. Fearing reprisals by Damascus, Nasma and her family frantically packed their bags and readied themselves to flee. She was proud of never having left Aleppo, not after the popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011 spilled into a bloody civil war; not after her home town was gripped by fierce street battles in which rebel fighters pushed for control of every inch of territory while Russian airstrikes pummelled the city. They had opted to stay after Assad regained control of Aleppo in 2016. This moment threatened to be different. Getting out of the city, however, was looking difficult. The road south to Homs, which remains under Syrian regime control, appeared too dangerous for them as the fighting moved south. Instead, Nasma passed the time at the weekend frantically searching for information on social media and reading messages from some of her family elsewhere in Aleppo. Uniformed and armed fighters knocked on residents\u2019 doors and used loudspeakers normally used for broadcasting the call to prayer from the city\u2019s stone minarets to tell people to stay at home, trying to reassure them their families and property would be safe, she said. \u201cPeople said these soldiers were behaving well, and even reassuring them that they came to protect them and wouldn\u2019t harm anyone,\u201d Nasma said. Fears of reprisal airstrikes by Damascus and allied forces continued to grip the residents as the weekend wore on, worsened by a strike in the centre of the city close to the entrance of Aleppo university hospital. Humanitarian groups on the ground said they believed the strike was carried out by Russian forces, recalling those that destroyed swaths of the eastern part of the city a decade ago. Yemn Sayed Issa, working with the humanitarian organisation Violet whose ambulances sustained damage in the airstrike, said: \u201cThe airstrike targeted the middle of Aleppo \u2026 We believe 12 were killed and more injured. The hospital there is not working and there are no medics working there. \u201cMost people there are afraid and are staying at home. Aleppo lacks so many things to be honest, there\u2019s a need for bread, food and water. I think in 24 hours there\u2019s probably going to be a curfew enforced, to keep people off the streets,\u201d he said in a voice message sent to the organisation ActionAid. What life could be like under HTS remained unclear. The group, designated as a terrorist organisation by Washington in 2013, has ruled neighbouring Idlib province for years under the leadership of Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, who has a $10m (\u00a37.6m) bounty on his head. While Jolani has attempted to demonstrate the group\u2019s ability to govern Idlib, setting up institutions and encouraging a flow of international aid that sustains millions of people sheltering there, the group has also been accused of repressing challenges to its rule. Karam Shaar, an analyst at the New Lines Institute, long exiled from his home town, said many Aleppans, millions of whom have been displaced within Syria and overseas, were cautiously optimistic about the change of rule. \u201cThose who are happy, and I think they are the majority, are happy as they can now go back to their homes. People who are abroad can go back to Syria and visit Aleppo again \u2013 I am in that camp,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I also think many are scared because of what\u2019s going to come next,\u201d he added, fearing more airstrikes by the regime in Damascus and their allies in Moscow. He was also concerned about how HTS would run a major city. \u201cThey have proven to be much more competent than other de-facto authorities in the country, meaning providing public services, but they are radical Islamists,\u201d he said, pointing to the group\u2019s efforts to distance itself from its past affiliation with al-Qaida. \u201cI still think they should be considered too extreme to the average Aleppan,\u201d he said. They had never expressed any desire to rule territory through democratic means, he added. Late on Saturday night, Jolani released a message to his foot soldiers intended to show that things could be different with his newly expanded rule of Aleppo. \u201cIslam has taught us kindness and mercy,\u201d he said. \u201cYour bravery in battle does not mean cruelty and injustice towards civilians.\u201d He told fighters they should be role models \u201cof tolerance and forgiveness \u2026 Beware of excessive killing.\u201d Despite Jolani\u2019s recent overtures to Christian and Druze leaders around Idlib in a display of potential tolerance, Aleppo\u2019s Christian communities were fearful. Archbishop Afram Maalouli, of the Greek Orthodox archdiocese in the city, told those who wished to remain in the city to \u201cavoid wandering\u201d, but he reassured his flock that prayers in their churches would remain ongoing \u201csubject to circumstance\u201d.

While abandoning the treaty aligned with the first Trump administration\u2019s broader opposition to arms control, continuing to pressure Mr Putin into compliance would have been the wiser course. Targeting Kyiv\u2019s forces are the hypersonic Oreshnik missile and the ballistic Iskander missile. Both can carry a nuclear warhead and would have been barred under the INF treaty. These weapons signal an alarming return to cold war-style tit-for\u2011tat posturing, with great powers ramping up their military capabilities. Their use highlights Moscow\u2019s accelerated missile development. But it also raises questions about the implications of a nuclear-tipped Oreshnik missile \u2013 capable of striking European capitals within 12 to 16 minutes \u2013 for Nato security. The deployment of such missiles exposes the risks of abandoning arms control.

A central remaining question has been why Russian agents were sent to Salisbury to kill Skripal.</p> <p>In his witness statement, Skripal said that when he worked for the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency, he had access to \u201csecret information\u201d and \u201cwas aware of allegations that Putin had been involved in illegal activity to do with the disposal of rare metals\u201d.</p> <p>When Skripal was interviewed by British police after the nerve agent attack in March 2018, he talked about Putin \u201cembezzling\u201d the proceeds of aluminium sales.</p> <p>Asked by counsel to the inquiry, Andrew O\u2019Connor, whether knowledge of Putin\u2019s \u201ccriminal embezzlement\u201d could have been the motive for the attack at the inquiry, Jonathan Allen, the director general of defence and intelligence at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, said he took Skripal\u2019s claim at face value. </p> <p>He said: \u201cIt makes sense that if he [Skripal] was working as a senior member of the GRU he would have access to secret information. On the allegations regarding President Putin, it is very difficult to know exactly what happens in Russia. The civil society is pretty nonexistent, the independent media has been shut down, the judicial system operates to protect the government and President Putin.</p> <p>\u201cThere have been numerous open-source works which link senior figures in the government including the president to control of natural resources, to control of the sources of Russian wealth and suggestions they profited from those. Certainly President Putin is at the top of a state that is highly corrupt and which ensures loyalty through patronage and fear. I would say they could be motives.\u201d</p> <p>Since October, an inquiry in the UK has been looking at the circumstances surrounding the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/12/dawn-sturgess-parents-await-novichok-inquiry-answers\">Dawn Sturgess</a>, who was poisoned with novichok in June 2018, three months after the attack on Skripal.</p> <p>On the final day of evidence last week, Allen was asked about an email chain produced at the inquiry involving Foreign Office and UK Cabinet officials in which they reported remarks Putin had made about Skripal and Sturgess, who died after spraying herself with nerve agent from a fake perfume bottle found by her partner Charlie Rowley.</p> <p>The officials said Putin had described Skripal as a \u201ctraitor\u201d and suggested he may have worked with the UK after he came to England after a spy swap. Putin is reported to have said: \u201cHe left and continued cooperating and he consulted some special services.\u201d Allen said he could not comment on this claim.</p> <p>Of Sturgess and Rowley, Putin reportedly said: \u201cDo you want to say we have also poisoned some homeless person? Some guys come and begin poisoning homeless people there. Nonsense. What, do they work for some kind of cleansing department?\u201d</p> <p>Allen said the comments were \u201crather callous\u201d. He said: \u201cThey are offensive in the extreme, and again rather indicative perhaps of his rather dismissive attitude to what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p> <p>On the final day of the inquiry on Monday, Sturgess\u2019s legal team will argue that more could have been done to protect the British people from the Russian threat.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Vladimir Putin may have ordered the assassination attempt on Sergei Skripal because the former Russian spy harboured secret information about the Russian president\u2019s \u201ccriminal embezzlement\u201d of profits from metals production, the UK government believes. A leading intelligence official on Russia has said he took \u201cat face value\u201d Skripal\u2019s assertions that secrets he knew about how Putin may have made money led to the nerve agent attack on him in Salisbury. An inquiry into the poisonings has heard that Foreign Office experts concluded Putin personally ordered the attack as it was inconceivable that such an audacious action would have been carried out without his say-so. A central remaining question has been why Russian agents were sent to Salisbury to kill Skripal. In his witness statement, Skripal said that when he worked for the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency, he had access to \u201csecret information\u201d and \u201cwas aware of allegations that Putin had been involved in illegal activity to do with the disposal of rare metals\u201d. When Skripal was interviewed by British police after the nerve agent attack in March 2018, he talked about Putin \u201cembezzling\u201d the proceeds of aluminium sales. Asked by counsel to the inquiry, Andrew O\u2019Connor, whether knowledge of Putin\u2019s \u201ccriminal embezzlement\u201d could have been the motive for the attack at the inquiry, Jonathan Allen, the director general of defence and intelligence at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, said he took Skripal\u2019s claim at face value. He said: \u201cIt makes sense that if he [Skripal] was working as a senior member of the GRU he would have access to secret information. On the allegations regarding President Putin, it is very difficult to know exactly what happens in Russia. The civil society is pretty nonexistent, the independent media has been shut down, the judicial system operates to protect the government and President Putin. \u201cThere have been numerous open-source works which link senior figures in the government including the president to control of natural resources, to control of the sources of Russian wealth and suggestions they profited from those. Certainly President Putin is at the top of a state that is highly corrupt and which ensures loyalty through patronage and fear. I would say they could be motives.\u201d Since October, an inquiry in the UK has been looking at the circumstances surrounding the death of Dawn Sturgess, who was poisoned with novichok in June 2018, three months after the attack on Skripal. On the final day of evidence last week, Allen was asked about an email chain produced at the inquiry involving Foreign Office and UK Cabinet officials in which they reported remarks Putin had made about Skripal and Sturgess, who died after spraying herself with nerve agent from a fake perfume bottle found by her partner Charlie Rowley. The officials said Putin had described Skripal as a \u201ctraitor\u201d and suggested he may have worked with the UK after he came to England after a spy swap. Putin is reported to have said: \u201cHe left and continued cooperating and he consulted some special services.\u201d Allen said he could not comment on this claim. Of Sturgess and Rowley, Putin reportedly said: \u201cDo you want to say we have also poisoned some homeless person? Some guys come and begin poisoning homeless people there. Nonsense. What, do they work for some kind of cleansing department?\u201d Allen said the comments were \u201crather callous\u201d. He said: \u201cThey are offensive in the extreme, and again rather indicative perhaps of his rather dismissive attitude to what\u2019s happened.\u201d On the final day of the inquiry on Monday, Sturgess\u2019s legal team will argue that more could have been done to protect the British people from the Russian threat.",

      "body": "<p>I love the amorous mayhem of Handel\u2019s operas, but have always had my doubts about his oratorios, especially the <em>Messiah</em>. First there\u2019s the bossy compulsion to stand during the \u201cHallelujah\u201d chorus, just because a spurious tradition says that King George II did so in 1743; once hoisted upright, you have to fidget through endless awkwardly mis-accentuated iterations of \u201cfor ever and ever\u201d. I\u2019m also puzzled by the quirks of the biblical text, which are underlined by musical repetition. The soprano rhapsodises like a fetishist about the \u201cbeautiful feet\u201d of those who preach the gospel, and the tenor prophesies that \u201cevery valley shall be exalted\u201d by the saviour: will salvation really reflate those sagging hollows in the landscape?</p> <p>But after reading Charles King\u2019s <em>Every Valley: The Story of Handel\u2019s Messiah</em>, I have been converted. King doesn\u2019t exactly explicate the phrase he takes for his title, but he points out that Martin Luther King often quoted it in his orations about civil rights, so I probably shouldn\u2019t quibble. More importantly, his book humanises the work\u2019s exalted creators and demonstrates that the <em>Messiah</em> is not a pompous manifesto of faith but a troubled, often desperate quest for consolation. Despite those hectoring hallelujahs, what moves King is the oratorio\u2019s prescription for overcoming personal misery.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Installed at the English court, Handel spied for his royal patrons in Germany while his music glorified the local Hanoverians</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>King begins with the librettist Charles Jennens, a rich but miserably hypochondriac book collector, haunted by the suicide of a brother who had cut his throat and then for good measure defenestrated himself at the Middle Temple. The biblical quotations that Jennens collaged together for Handel had a secret psychological plot: they were \u201can affirmation of something Jennens himself had always found it hard to believe in\u201d. Handel too, as seen by King, is a worldly figure, an obese epicure \u201cwith prominent jowls and a chin that stairstepped down into his cravat\u201d. His statue in Westminster Abbey shows him pointing a finger heavenwards as he displays a page of the <em>Messiah</em> score that declares his faith in a redeemer; a trumpet pokes out at us, ready to amplify the pious message. But far from ingratiating himself with God, Handel had a diabolical temper and once silenced the uncooperative soprano Francesca Cuzzoni by telling her \u201cI am Beelzebub, the chief of the devils!\u201d and threatening to toss her out of the window.</p> <p>The soprano who appeared in the first performance of the <em>Messiah</em>, Susannah Cibber, was less turbulent in rehearsals than Cuzzoni but even more flagrant offstage. She was trafficked by her husband, who sold her sexual favours to a crony to defray his debts. Sneaky servants drilled holes in walls to watch her lover \u201cput his privy member between her legs\u201d, and scandal sheets reported on her sensational abduction from a country retreat by a posse of armed thugs. After these infamies, her performance in the <em>Messiah</em> was an attempt to relaunch her career and launder her sullied reputation: early audiences took her delivery of Handel\u2019s solemn recitatives about Christ\u2019s agony to be a personal appeal for restitution, since she, too, was \u201cdespised and rejected\u201d and \u201cacquainted with grief\u201d. Supplied with this subtext, the oratorio becomes something of an enjoyably tawdry soap opera.</p> <p>King, a professor of international affairs in Washington DC, does a fine job of implicating Handel in the conflicts and contradictions of an unsettled society. He first travelled from Hanover to London in 1710, arriving in what seemed to be \u201ca failed state, mired in revolution, political conspiracy and murder\u201d. Installed at the English court, he unofficially spied for his royal patrons at home in Germany while composing music to glorify the local Hanoverians, who captured the crown from the Stuart dynasty in 1714: King argues that the chorus in the <em>Messiah</em> that salutes Christ as \u201cWonderful, Counsellor, the Prince of Peace\u201d was a coded tribute to George II. Handel\u2019s colleague Thomas Arne, who happened to be Susannah Cibber\u2019s brother, supplied the monarchy with its imperial anthem in \u201cRule, Britannia!\u201d. Although Britons here boast that they \u201cnever never never shall be slaves\u201d, they happily profited from the enslavement of others.

      "bodyText": "I love the amorous mayhem of Handel\u2019s operas, but have always had my doubts about his oratorios, especially the Messiah. First there\u2019s the bossy compulsion to stand during the \u201cHallelujah\u201d chorus, just because a spurious tradition says that King George II did so in 1743; once hoisted upright, you have to fidget through endless awkwardly mis-accentuated iterations of \u201cfor ever and ever\u201d. I\u2019m also puzzled by the quirks of the biblical text, which are underlined by musical repetition. The soprano rhapsodises like a fetishist about the \u201cbeautiful feet\u201d of those who preach the gospel, and the tenor prophesies that \u201cevery valley shall be exalted\u201d by the saviour: will salvation really reflate those sagging hollows in the landscape? But after reading Charles King\u2019s Every Valley: The Story of Handel\u2019s Messiah, I have been converted. King doesn\u2019t exactly explicate the phrase he takes for his title, but he points out that Martin Luther King often quoted it in his orations about civil rights, so I probably shouldn\u2019t quibble. More importantly, his book humanises the work\u2019s exalted creators and demonstrates that the Messiah is not a pompous manifesto of faith but a troubled, often desperate quest for consolation. Despite those hectoring hallelujahs, what moves King is the oratorio\u2019s prescription for overcoming personal misery. King begins with the librettist Charles Jennens, a rich but miserably hypochondriac book collector, haunted by the suicide of a brother who had cut his throat and then for good measure defenestrated himself at the Middle Temple. The biblical quotations that Jennens collaged together for Handel had a secret psychological plot: they were \u201can affirmation of something Jennens himself had always found it hard to believe in\u201d. Handel too, as seen by King, is a worldly figure, an obese epicure \u201cwith prominent jowls and a chin that stairstepped down into his cravat\u201d. His statue in Westminster Abbey shows him pointing a finger heavenwards as he displays a page of the Messiah score that declares his faith in a redeemer; a trumpet pokes out at us, ready to amplify the pious message. But far from ingratiating himself with God, Handel had a diabolical temper and once silenced the uncooperative soprano Francesca Cuzzoni by telling her \u201cI am Beelzebub, the chief of the devils!\u201d and threatening to toss her out of the window. The soprano who appeared in the first performance of the Messiah, Susannah Cibber, was less turbulent in rehearsals than Cuzzoni but even more flagrant offstage. She was trafficked by her husband, who sold her sexual favours to a crony to defray his debts. Sneaky servants drilled holes in walls to watch her lover \u201cput his privy member between her legs\u201d, and scandal sheets reported on her sensational abduction from a country retreat by a posse of armed thugs. After these infamies, her performance in the Messiah was an attempt to relaunch her career and launder her sullied reputation: early audiences took her delivery of Handel\u2019s solemn recitatives about Christ\u2019s agony to be a personal appeal for restitution, since she, too, was \u201cdespised and rejected\u201d and \u201cacquainted with grief\u201d. Supplied with this subtext, the oratorio becomes something of an enjoyably tawdry soap opera. King, a professor of international affairs in Washington DC, does a fine job of implicating Handel in the conflicts and contradictions of an unsettled society. He first travelled from Hanover to London in 1710, arriving in what seemed to be \u201ca failed state, mired in revolution, political conspiracy and murder\u201d. Installed at the English court, he unofficially spied for his royal patrons at home in Germany while composing music to glorify the local Hanoverians, who captured the crown from the Stuart dynasty in 1714: King argues that the chorus in the Messiah that salutes Christ as \u201cWonderful, Counsellor, the Prince of Peace\u201d was a coded tribute to George II. Handel\u2019s colleague Thomas Arne, who happened to be Susannah Cibber\u2019s brother, supplied the monarchy with its imperial anthem in \u201cRule, Britannia!\u201d. Although Britons here boast that they \u201cnever never never shall be slaves\u201d, they happily profited from the enslavement of others. Both Jennens and Handel were clients of the South Sea Company, whose \u201csignature money-making venture\u201d, as King notes, was \u201cthe involuntary transport of human beings\u201d from Africa to the American colonies. Music, the airiest and most spiritual of arts, is murkily embedded in the realities of politics, commerce and inhuman exploitation. All the same, King derives an irreligious solace from the Messiah. He turned to it, he reveals, after a time of troubles \u2013 first, the morbidly anxious pandemic, then his wife\u2019s serious illness, finally the ghastly day in 2021 when, blocks from his house, Trump\u2019s crazed vigilantes overran the US Capitol. The \u201cmessed-up state of everything\u201d left King with a desire for \u201chealing light\u201d; this was supplied by Handel\u2019s tenor who, before he exalts the valleys, conveys God\u2019s reassurance by declaiming, \u201cComfort ye, my people\u201d. Listening to this at home on their antiquated gramophone, King and his wife burst into grateful tears. After the recent election, they will be in need of further comfort. But the Messiah, King says, is an admonition \u201cto live bravely in the face of disaster and defeat\u201d, and I hope it sustains him during the next four years of what the tenor rightly calls \u201ciniquity\u201d. \u2022 Every Valley: The Story of Handel\u2019s Messiah by Charles King is published by Bodley Head (\u00a325).

      "bodyText": "The UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees has suspended aid deliveries through the main lifeline for the Gaza Strip after a fresh attack by armed gangs on a humanitarian convoy, amid a severe food crisis caused by more than a year of fighting between Israel and Hamas. In a statement on Sunday, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of Unrwa, said several trucks carrying food supplies were looted the day before on the road from Kerem Shalom on the border with Israel, now the main aid crossing point into the besieged Palestinian territory. The route had not been safe for months, he said on X, referring to the unprecedented hijacking of nearly 100 aid trucks last month. \u201cThis difficult decision comes at a time hunger is rapidly deepening \u2026 due to the ongoing siege, hurdles from Israeli authorities, political decisions to restrict the amounts of aid, lack of safety on aid routes and targeting of local police. All of the above led to a breakdown in law and order,\u201d he said. Lazzarini said protecting aid workers and supplies was Israel\u2019s responsibility as the occupying power in the Palestinian territories, and he called on the country to \u201censure aid flows into Gaza safely\u201d and to \u201crefrain from attacks on humanitarian workers\u201d. An Israeli airstrike on Saturday in Khan Younis killed three contractors working for World Central Kitchen, Palestinian media reported, leading the US-based charity to pause operations. The Israeli military said one of the World Central Kitchen employees was a Hamas militant involved in the 7 October attacks that triggered the war. It did not provide evidence to support the claim. The aid organisation lost seven workers in an Israeli drone strike in April that Israel said was a mistake. Humanitarian agencies working in Gaza have struggled to collect and distribute supplies amid Israeli military activity, blocks on movement and Israeli attacks that have targeted employees, suspending operations on several occasions. According to Unrwa, only 65 aid trucks a day entered Gaza in November, compared with a prewar average of 500. As of October, 333 aid workers had been killed since the conflict began, according to the UN. The world body estimates that about one-third of aid is stolen by armed gangs who resell it at extortionate prices. Israel denies deliberately restricting aid to Gaza or ignoring the proliferation of gangs and organised crime. It also accuses Hamas of diverting aid. The Palestinian militant group denies that, in turn alleging that Israel has tried to foment anarchy by systematically targeting Hamas-employed police guarding aid convoys. At least 32 people were killed in Israeli strikes across the enclave in the past 24 hours, while Hamas leaders met Egyptian security officials in Cairo on Sunday to discuss reviving ceasefire talks. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the attacks. The Biden administration wants to build on the success of last week\u2019s ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese group Hezbollah, although there is no indication yet from Hamas or Israel that their terms for a truce have changed. The White House is working on a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza but is \u201cnot there yet\u201d, Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, told NBC on Sunday. About 44,300 Palestinians have been killed in more than a year of fighting, according to the local health ministry, whose figures are considered by the UN to be accurate, and 90% of the 2.3 million population have been displaced from their homes. A total of 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 taken captive in the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. Israel says 63 of the remaining 101 hostages are still alive. Meanwhile, the Lebanon ceasefire appeared to be on shaky ground as both sides accused the other of new violations. The Israeli military carried out airstrikes in four areas on the Syria-Lebanon border on Saturday against what it said was military infrastructure and Hezbollah activities that \u201cposed a threat\u201d. The Syrian border is a key weapons supply route for the Iran-allied group. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said an Israeli strike on a car in Majdal Zoun wounded three people including a seven-year-old child. Israeli warplanes targeted what the military claimed was a rocket storage facility on Thursday, reportedly hitting a location north of the Litani River, which is not included in the 60-day ceasefire and staged withdrawal agreement. Israeli forces have aimed gun and tank fire at cars and people returning to areas near the UN-demarcated blue line separating the two countries, which Israel still considers restricted. Thousands of displaced civilians have attempted to return to their homes in southern Lebanon in the past few days amid contradictory instructions from Lebanese and Israeli officials.",

A selection will be published in our Readers\u2019 best photographs galleries and in the print edition on Saturdays.",

Wark said she felt the comments were \u201creally, really in the wrong place\u201d and that they made people \u201cuncomfortable\u201d.</p> <p>The former Newsnight host said she raised it at the time with an executive at the production company, Shine, and the gist of the reply was \u201calmost as if it was some kind of affliction\u201d, adding: \u201cAnd if his behaviour became too egregious, he\u2019d be pulled back.\u201d</p> <p>Wark was one of 13 people making allegations about Wallace\u2019s conduct over a 17-year period, BBC News reported last Thursday. The claims included Wallace talking openly about his sex life, taking his top off in front of a female worker saying he wanted to \u201cgive her a fashion show\u201d, and telling a junior female colleague he wasn\u2019t wearing any boxer shorts under his jeans.</p> <h2>Allegations dating back 19 years</h2> <p>Many of the accusations against Wallace span the last decade, the height of Wallace\u2019s TV fame, but some date as far back as 19 years. BBC News reported that a worker on MasterChef said Wallace regularly made sexually explicit remarks on set in 2005 and 2006.</p> <p>A former contestant, Dr Kate Tomas, has said she complained about his treatment of her on the show in 2008 but that nothing was done. In a video on TikTok, Tomas alleged that he sexually harassed her and described him as \u201cdisgusting and repulsive\u201d.</p> <p>She called him a \u201cracist piece of shit\u201d and claimed he impersonated an Indian accent in front of a staff member who was Indian. Tomas said his actions meant she refused to appear again on the show when they asked her to return as one of the \u201cbest losers\u201d.</p> <h2>Kirstie Allsopp</h2> <p>The presenter Kirstie Allsopp became the latest person to accuse Wallace of making inappropriate remarks when she said he referred to sex acts shortly after meeting her.</p> <p>Writing on X on Sunday, the co-host of Location, Location, Location <a href=\"https://x.com/KirstieMAllsopp/status/1863168839816499630\">said</a>: \u201cWithin 1 hour of meeting Gregg Walllace he told me of a sex act that he and his partner at the time enjoyed \u2018every morning\u2019, she\u2019d just left the room, we were filming a pilot. Did he get off on how embarrassed I was? It was totally unprofessional, I\u2019m a #MiddleClassWomanOfaCertainAge.\u201d</p> <p>Allsopp said Wallace made the remarks in the green room rather than on camera. She added: \u201cWhy say nothing? Because you feel, in no particular order, embarrassed, a prude, shocked, waiting for a male colleague to call him out, not wanting to \u2018rock the boat\u2019, thinking it\u2019s better to plough on with the day, assuming you misheard/misunderstood or just don\u2019t get the joke.\u201d</p> <h2>Complaint in 2012</h2> <p>A number of women have said they reported concerns about Wallace to television bosses years ago but he was allowed to remain on screen. The actor and author Emma Kennedy said she complained about the presenter to production staff in 2012 after he allegedly touched another woman\u2019s bottom.</p> <p>Kennedy, who won the seventh edition of Celebrity MasterChef, said: \u201cI complained about behaviour I witnessed on MasterChef in 2012. They knew then. They knew before then and they\u2019ve known since.</p> <p>\u201cThe photographer had a young female assistant and she bent over and in front of me.

I think he touched her, because she did react, though I cannot be 100% certain that he did touch her.</p> <p>\u201cHe thought it was funny. It wasn\u2019t the act of a sexual predator; it was the act of somebody who just doesn\u2019t get that that stuff is inappropriate.\u201d</p> <p>Kennedy said she later spoke to a member of the MasterChef public relations team and that \u201cthe only topic of conversation was \u2018when the problem with GW was going to come to light\u2019\u201d.</p> <h2>Complaint in 2017</h2> <p>The Sunday Times has <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/article/gregg-wallace-bbc-allegations-accused-d8hkq63fp\">reported</a> that Wallace was told by a BBC executive in 2017 that his behaviour was \u201cunacceptable and cannot continue\u201d after complaints were made by the broadcaster Aasmah Mir, who appeared on the 12th series of Celebrity MasterChef.</p> <p>Kate Phillips, who oversees unscripted programmes for the BBC, said she would ensure that she was \u201cinformed straight away\u201d should further allegations be made against the MasterChef host, according to the report.</p> <p>Mir apparently wrote in an email forwarded to Phillips in November 2017: \u201cShould anything happen in the future, I don\u2019t want to feel guilty when people say \u2018why wasn\u2019t anything said before?\u2019, or for producers or editors to claim they didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <h2>Warning in 2018</h2> <p>Wallace is said to have received a warning from BBC bosses in 2018 after a complaint was raised about his behaviour on the quizshow Impossible Celebrities. Two of the women who complained <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd7n1e8n721o\">told BBC News</a> that he made staff feel uncomfortable by talking about his sex life and making \u201cdisgusting\u201d sexual jokes.</p> <p>The broadcaster reported that a formal HR investigation took place and concluded that \u201cmany aspects of [Wallace\u2019s] behaviour were both unacceptable and unprofessional\u201d.</p> <p>In a subsequent letter, seen by BBC News, a BBC executive said she had held a 90-minute meeting with Wallace to make clear \u201chow seriously the BBC takes this matter\u201d. She also reassured the workers that action would be taken \u201cto prevent a similar reoccurrence and to safeguard others in the future\u201d. But further incidents have since emerged.</p> <h2>Complaint in 2022</h2> <p>A letter containing several allegations of inappropriate behaviour by Wallace was sent to the BBC in 2022 but did not prompt further investigation at the time, the<em> </em>Observer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/nov/30/gregg-wallace-behaviour-letter-bbc-2022-masterchef-presenter\">revealed</a> on Sunday.</p> <p>The letter described a \u201cpattern of behaviour\u201d by the<em> </em>MasterChef presenter that \u201cclearly fails to meet the sexual harassment and bullying standards that prohibit unwelcome sexual advances and sexual innuendo\u201d.</p> <p>Dawn Elrick, the director and producer who sent the 2022 letter on behalf of other women who had contacted her, said the BBC suggested each individual would have to make their own direct complaint to the corporation.</p> <p>Elrick said that soon after sending the letter she also submitted the allegations to the BBC via Navex Global, an external whistleblowing service. She said she received no further contact with regards to that report.</p> <p>Elrick said the BBC\u2019s lack of action showed there was \u201cno satisfactory means of reporting sexual harassment and bullying within the TV industry\u201d.</p> <h2>Claims about other shows</h2> <p>Wallace is facing claims from people who worked or appeared on other shows in addition to those related to MasterChef, Celebrity MasterChef and Impossible Celebrities. Women who worked on the shows Gregg Wallace\u2019s Big Weekends and Eat Well for Less? allege he regularly behaved inappropriately, including making \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d comments about sex.</p> <p>One woman said he made constant \u201clesbian jokes\u201d and became \u201cfascinated\u201d by her relationships with women and wanted to know the \u201clogistics\u201d of how she dated, while filming Big Weekends in 2019.</p> <p>Another woman told BBC News that while working on the Channel 5 programme at the same time Wallace\u2019s conversation often revolved around sex, including spanking and domination.</p> <p>Last year, Wallace stood down from the show Inside the Factory after staff at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in York complained that he made inappropriate comments about the weight of female employees.</p> <h2>Wallace responds</h2> <p>Wallace\u2019s lawyers have said the suggestion that he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature is entirely false.</p> <p>He took aim at his accusers in an Instagram video on Sunday, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve been doing MasterChef for 20 years, amateur, celebrity and professional MasterChef, and I think in that time I have worked with over 4,000 contestants of all different ages, all different backgrounds, all walks of life.</p> <p>\u201cApparently now, I\u2019m reading in the paper, there\u2019s been 13 complaints in that time. In the newspaper, I can see the complaints coming from a handful of middle-class women of a certain age, just from Celebrity MasterChef. This isn\u2019t right.</p> <p>\u201cIn 20 years, over 20 years of television, can you imagine how many women, female contestants on MasterChef, have made sexual remarks, or sexual innuendo? Can you imagine?\u201d</p> <p>Wallace went on to claim that \u201cabsolutely none\u201d of the staff on his other shows had complained about him.</p> <p>He said: \u201cLook, this is important to me. Twenty years of doing Celebrity MasterChef, amateur, professional, Eat Well for Less?, Inside the Factory. Do you know how many staff, all different sorts of staff, you imagine the people I\u2019ve worked with. Do you know how many staff complained about me in that time? Absolutely none. Zero. Seriously.\u201d</p> <h2>Broadcasters respond</h2> <p>MasterChef\u2019s production company, Banijay UK, has launched an investigation into Wallace\u2019s behaviour and said the 60-year-old is \u201ccommitted to fully cooperating throughout the process\u201d.</p> <p>It said in a statement last week: \u201cWhile this review is under way, Gregg Wallace will be stepping away from his role on MasterChef and is committed to fully cooperating throughout the process.

It said anyone with issues or concerns could contact speakup@banijayuk.com in confidence.</p> <p>A BBC spokesperson said: \u201cWe are always clear that any behaviour which falls below the standards expected by the BBC will not be tolerated. Where an individual is contracted directly by an external production company we share any complaints or concerns with that company and we will always support them when addressing them.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Channel 5, which airs Big Weekends, said: \u201cWe take any allegations of this nature extremely seriously.

      "bodyText": "Gregg Wallace has been accused of making sexualised jokes and other inappropriate remarks towards a range of women dating back nearly two decades. The 60-year-old MasterChef presenter announced last week that he was stepping back from the BBC show amid an investigation into his conduct. Wallace\u2019s lawyers have said it is entirely false to suggest he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature. On Sunday he said his accusers were \u201cmiddle-class women of a certain age\u201d and claimed that \u201cabsolutely none\u201d of the staff on his other shows had complained about him. These are the allegations that have emerged in the last four days. Kirsty Wark and the 13 accusers The broadcaster Kirsty Wark was one of the first women to publicly accuse Wallace of inappropriate behaviour, telling BBC News last week that he told \u201csexualised\u201d jokes during filming of Celebrity MasterChef in 2011.

Kirstie Allsopp The presenter Kirstie Allsopp became the latest person to accuse Wallace of making inappropriate remarks when she said he referred to sex acts shortly after meeting her. Writing on X on Sunday, the co-host of Location, Location, Location said: \u201cWithin 1 hour of meeting Gregg Walllace he told me of a sex act that he and his partner at the time enjoyed \u2018every morning\u2019, she\u2019d just left the room, we were filming a pilot.

Complaint in 2017 The Sunday Times has reported that Wallace was told by a BBC executive in 2017 that his behaviour was \u201cunacceptable and cannot continue\u201d after complaints were made by the broadcaster Aasmah Mir, who appeared on the 12th series of Celebrity MasterChef. Kate Phillips, who oversees unscripted programmes for the BBC, said she would ensure that she was \u201cinformed straight away\u201d should further allegations be made against the MasterChef host, according to the report. Mir apparently wrote in an email forwarded to Phillips in November 2017: \u201cShould anything happen in the future, I don\u2019t want to feel guilty when people say \u2018why wasn\u2019t anything said before?\u2019, or for producers or editors to claim they didn\u2019t know.\u201d Warning in 2018 Wallace is said to have received a warning from BBC bosses in 2018 after a complaint was raised about his behaviour on the quizshow Impossible Celebrities. Two of the women who complained told BBC News that he made staff feel uncomfortable by talking about his sex life and making \u201cdisgusting\u201d sexual jokes. The broadcaster reported that a formal HR investigation took place and concluded that \u201cmany aspects of [Wallace\u2019s] behaviour were both unacceptable and unprofessional\u201d. In a subsequent letter, seen by BBC News, a BBC executive said she had held a 90-minute meeting with Wallace to make clear \u201chow seriously the BBC takes this matter\u201d. She also reassured the workers that action would be taken \u201cto prevent a similar reoccurrence and to safeguard others in the future\u201d. But further incidents have since emerged. Complaint in 2022 A letter containing several allegations of inappropriate behaviour by Wallace was sent to the BBC in 2022 but did not prompt further investigation at the time, the Observer revealed on Sunday. The letter described a \u201cpattern of behaviour\u201d by the MasterChef presenter that \u201cclearly fails to meet the sexual harassment and bullying standards that prohibit unwelcome sexual advances and sexual innuendo\u201d. Dawn Elrick, the director and producer who sent the 2022 letter on behalf of other women who had contacted her, said the BBC suggested each individual would have to make their own direct complaint to the corporation. Elrick said that soon after sending the letter she also submitted the allegations to the BBC via Navex Global, an external whistleblowing service. She said she received no further contact with regards to that report. Elrick said the BBC\u2019s lack of action showed there was \u201cno satisfactory means of reporting sexual harassment and bullying within the TV industry\u201d. Claims about other shows Wallace is facing claims from people who worked or appeared on other shows in addition to those related to MasterChef, Celebrity MasterChef and Impossible Celebrities. Women who worked on the shows Gregg Wallace\u2019s Big Weekends and Eat Well for Less? allege he regularly behaved inappropriately, including making \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d comments about sex. One woman said he made constant \u201clesbian jokes\u201d and became \u201cfascinated\u201d by her relationships with women and wanted to know the \u201clogistics\u201d of how she dated, while filming Big Weekends in 2019. Another woman told BBC News that while working on the Channel 5 programme at the same time Wallace\u2019s conversation often revolved around sex, including spanking and domination. Last year, Wallace stood down from the show Inside the Factory after staff at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in York complained that he made inappropriate comments about the weight of female employees. Wallace responds Wallace\u2019s lawyers have said the suggestion that he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature is entirely false. He took aim at his accusers in an Instagram video on Sunday, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve been doing MasterChef for 20 years, amateur, celebrity and professional MasterChef, and I think in that time I have worked with over 4,000 contestants of all different ages, all different backgrounds, all walks of life. \u201cApparently now, I\u2019m reading in the paper, there\u2019s been 13 complaints in that time.

      "bodyText": "Jamie Jackson is our man at Old Trafford for Manchester United 4-0 Everton: And that will be all from me. Liverpool are currently beating crisis club Manchester City 1-0, thanks to a brilliant assist from Mohamed Salah for Cody Gakpo. Click here to find out more: Bye for now. Here is some more football content goodness from earlier today: Apropos of \u2026 football, Napoli have just beaten Torino 1-0 away. They are four clear at the top as it stands. Aston Villa\u2019s most recent victory was 2-0 against Bologna in the Champions League on 22 October. As the eagle-eyed among you will have noticed, it is now December. Anyway, Liverpool v Manchester City is very much on: \u201cEnzo Maresca\u2019s side are in third place due to alphabetical order, as they have an identical record to Arsenal, while Villa slipped to 12th after a fifth successive Premier League match without victory.\u201d That is the Premier League\u2019s match report. So is it alphabetical during the season, but then away goals in head to head at the end? A curious one to consider. It has been brought to my attention that Arsenal are (it would appear) second on away goals scored against Chelsea, rather than alphabetical order. If the head-to-head doesn\u2019t separate the teams, then it comes down to away goals in the head-to-head, and Arsenal scored in the 1-1 draw at Chelsea on 10 November. \u201cIf any clubs finish with the same number of points, their position in the Premier League table is determined by goal difference, then the number of goals scored, then the team who collected the most points in the head-to-head matches, then who scored most away goals in the head-to-head.\u201d Anyone turning up at Chelsea with hopes of seeing a wild exhibition of end-to-end, brainless football should start making alternative plans. They are maturing nicely under Enzo Maresca, whose focus on control is squeezing the life out of opposition sides, and continued their rise with this emphatic win over a supine Aston Villa. It would be tempting to talk of Tottenham at least being predictable in their unpredictability, of the way they cannot but follow up a great result with a disappointing one, of the inevitability of them, having beaten Manchester City 4-0 last weekend, failing to beat Fulham at home this. But actually the story on Sunday was far more about Fulham, how well they played and how mystifying it was they didn\u2019t take all three points having had the better of the majority of the game. Watching the Palmer goal again, it remains absolutely stunning, but Emery will be furious at the lack of urgency from his defenders. They just look knackered. Stat attack: Chelsea move joint-second, also known as third. They have an identical record to Arsenal, but are third on alphabetical order. Played 13, won seven, drawn 4, lost two, goal difference +12. Why not treat yourself and check out the table here. You want Liverpool v Manchester City? Of course you do. John Brewin has all the action: \u201cWhip-dee-doo-dah,\u201d is pundit Daniel Sturridge\u2019s assessment of Palmer\u2019s goal as he watches the replay. And I know exactly what he means. Villa were way off the pace. But Cole Palmer is a true artist, the Paul C\u00e9zanne of the Premier League. All part of our growth. Their growth, that is. And here comes Will Lankshear! Oh, Tom Cairney was sent off for Fulham a while back there, having scored the equaliser. Five added minutes, minimum, at Chelsea. Heady days at Old Trafford, with Amorim off to an exceptional start. 89 min: Felix brings a good save from Olsen as Chelsea go hunting more goals. Then he\u2019s booked for a clumsy tackle. 87 min: As I try to calm my nerves at what a good goal that was, and how brilliant Palmer has been in an all-round excellent Chelsea display, he is taken off to a standing ovation. Lavia and Palmer off, Gusto and Felix on. Oh my word that is a goal and a half. Having won the free-kick, it\u2019s taken short. Madueke does well to wait for his moment and feed Palmer. \u201cCold\u201d Palmer buys half a yard on the edge with a smart touch to his left. Having teed up the position and space for a shot, he wraps his left foot around the ball, calmly firing a curling, power-packed shot right into the top corner. Olsen is a mere spectator in goal as he watches the ball sail past him. Cole Palmer is very very very good at football. And that is that. Cole Palmer that is a DISGRACE! What a goal! 82 min: Caicedo shows his worth by intercepting a Villa pass and then embarking on a direct run from box to box. Old school. He feeds Palmer, who naturally doesn\u2019t waste the ball, but wins a free-kick near the edge of the area. But back to Ange-ball. Two draws from winning positions in the week following the thrashing of City isn\u2019t all that great. If indeed it finishes 1-1. \u201cI think everyone talks about new manager bounce,\u201d Everton\u2019s Dyche said on Friday before facing Manchester United and their shiny new manager. \u201cIt\u2019s more difficult in that way \u2026 they\u2019ve got good players, I\u2019m sure he [Amorim] has been working with the players and trying to get his thoughts across. \u201cI don\u2019t know much of his work, other than stuff from the TV, stats and facts.\u201d An email! Entitled: \u201cReaction.\u201d \u201cDisbelief mixed with fear of the inevitable stoppage time Spurs winner,\u201d writes Richard Hirst of Tottenham 1-1 Fulham (latest score). \u201cI\u2019ve been a Fulham fan for 60 years - I have previous.\u201d 74 min: Emery sits on his airline-style seat with his hands plunged into his pockets and a puzzled look on his fact. How does he get his team out of this current malaise? How has their form fallen off a cliff like this? My expert opinion is that they look tired. Give them a couple of days off. 72 min: Villa have done next to nothing. But if they get a goal here it\u2019ll make for a spicy denouement. They\u2019ve just had one corner, and have forced another. 70 min: Cole Palmer is just very good at football. He takes a pass with Chelsea looking to break. Instead of rushing things and making a hurried decision, he slows, takes an extra touch, and has a look to see what is on. Just like that, he clips a beautiful pass that curls into the path of Jackson, making a run down the Blues\u2019 left. Jackson then mucks up his own pass but still. Good run, good move. Maresca now takes Jackson off for Christopher Nkunku. Noni Madueke on for Sancho too. 67 min: Changes for Villa. Firstly, Barkley on for Kamara, which was on 62 min. Now Philogene and Rogers are off for Leon Bailey and Jhon Duran. All square in north London. You know, the longer that goes on at 1-1 \u2026 Richard, send me your reaction ASAP please. 64 min: Thanks to Scott for the heads up on email. Martinez, the Villa goalie, was taken off at half time, which I missed while making a cup of tea. I believe he may have been injured after that howler which nearly handed a goal to Jackson. Robin Olsen is in nets for Villa. Wowzers, United are BACK, baby! Ruben\u2019s at the wheel. 59 min: A break in play, unfortunately, because Fofana is going off injured for \u201cChels\u201d. Benoit Badiashile comes on. According to the commentators, Fofana stood on the ball and injured himself in the process, although in the style of a certain former Arsenal gaffer, I didn\u2019t see it. \u201cYeah Luke, but Fulham 12 shots to Spurs\u2019 six, and 10 corners to Spurs\u2019 four,\u201d fumes Richard Hirst. \u201cLess about Ange-ball than Fulham\u2019s customary inability to acquaint ball with net.\u201d 54 min: Sancho, who perhaps needless to say looks like an utterly different player to the Manchester United version, cuts in from the Chelsea left and sprints towards the box. Again Villa just look tired as they try to cover the Chelsea moves. The ball makes its way to Palmer who tries a lovely little pass back into the path of Sancho, who perhaps didn\u2019t quite read his teammate\u2019s intention. The ball ends up in the grateful hands of Martinez. Go Tottenham! Go Ange-ball! I love being wrong! And I\u2019ve got used to it! And there is the commentator\u2019s curse in full effect! The longer Spurs v Fulham is 0-0, the more I suspect it\u2019ll end 0-1 Fulham. I\u2019m a biiiiiig fan of Ange-ball after that Roma game though, as I mentioned earlier. The Ruben Amorim era goes from strength to strength. Seems like Rashford has responded to this, too: 46 min: McGinn has an early chance for the visitors and forces a save from Sanchez with a good curled effort. On the bench, Unai Emery looks suitably perplexed with his team\u2019s plight. Allez! Chelsea 2-0 Aston Villa Manchester United 2-0 Everton Tottenham 0-0 Fulham And here is your half-time reading \u2013 Michael Butler speaks to Tony Adams: 45 min+1: Watkins suddenly has a sight of goal after Fernandez is dispossessed by Philogene. Watkins cracks a low shot, saved by Sanchez. Careless from Chelsea, and that might affect Maresca\u2019s half-time team talk a bit because they were in full control until then. 45 min: We\u2019ll have a minimum of five minutes added on at Stamford Bridge. Tottenham v Fulham remains NIL-NIL. United win the third, fourth and fifth ball (not that I\u2019ve seen the goal mind you) and they are 2-0 up on Everton at Old Trafford. 41 min: Now Palmer takes a ball to feet from Caicedo and turns and shoots from the edge of the area \u2013 but he scuffs it badly. Still, lots of space to operate for Chelsea\u2019s attackers. Villa look punch-drunk. It\u2019s a classy move by Chelsea and classy assist by (who else, by the way?) Cole Palmer. He arrows a pass to the feet of Fernandez who places a smart finish beyond Martinez from just inside the area. It\u2019s a perfect first touch that tees up the shot perfectly, but doesn\u2019t give the covering defenders a chance to get near him. Villa look way off the pace defensively and their slump is threatening to become a crisis. Villa were wobbling. Now they are two down. 35 min: Chelsea are pushing. Villa are wobbling. Sancho buys a yard of space in the box and fires a shot goalwards but it\u2019s high and wide. He has a word with the ref after, as if he wants a penalty, but his claim is waved away. Perhaps he got a little shove in the back but nothing major. Manchester United, presumably having won a second ball, take the lead via Marcus Rashford. Tottenham \u2026 0 Fulham \u2026 0 (latest score) 30 min: Deary me! After claiming that cross from Neto, Martinez dallies with the ball having put it on the deck, looking to play a pass to a defender. He eventually plays a quite dreadful pass which is almost straight into the path of Jackson, who is trying to press the ball and be a nuisance. I say almost into the path, because it\u2019s slightly behind the striker, but he still takes a touch towards goal, and Martinez dives desperately to block. That could have raised the comedy stakes considerably. 29 min: Neto advances threateningly down the Chelsea right. He checks back and then floats a delightfully inviting cross towards the far post. Martinez does well to leap and claim it. It is also sans goals at Tottenham v Fulham. Manchester United \u2026 0 Everton \u2026 0 (latest score) 25 min: Scenes. Chelsea set up the free-kick from about 10 yards. Villa are of course lined up, camped on the goal line. Fernandez touches the ball to Palmer, who slams a shot straight at Martinez. Lavia has a follow up effort that is also blocked. Villa get away with it! 23 min: Drama! Palmer mugs Tielemans on the edge of the Villa box. He turns and drills a powerful shot which is destined for the bottom corner. Martinez saves, and then the ref rules it was a backpass from Pau Torres after the ball was parried by the goalie, and the goalie picks it up! Free-kick for Chelsea near the penalty spot! Literally just outside the six yard box! 21 min: Sancho threatens again on the left for Chelsea. Lavia with a smart ball in behind. But Villa manage to cover. 18 min: It\u2019s been a lively start at the Bridge, with the caveat that Chelsea showed zero interest in pressing the ball in the opening moments. The Aston Villa defenders were just standing there wondering what to do with the ball. I wonder why Maresca told them to do that? Maybe a chance to have a nice little rest before getting into the game properly? \u201cLuke, Morning greetings from Free State California,\u201d writes Mary Waltz. \u201cLooking at Everton\u2019s December fixtures this may be the only chance for Everton to pick up points. This says a lot about both squads. Sigh.\u201d I\u2019m still chuckling about Ruben Amorim\u2019s thoughts on what to expect from Everton, that he gave on Friday: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a different match, with a lot of fighting, a lot of long balls, second balls \u2026 a quality coach that understands the league.\u201d Oh yes, a quality coach, but terrible football, you understand. I like the cut of Amorim\u2019s jib. 15 min: Villa stream forward again and Watkins is one on one! Albeit from an angle. His teammate Rogers is in the middle, praying for a pass. But Watkins shoots and Sanchez saves. 13min: Amusing emails aside, football is happening at Stamford Bridge. Villa break and Tielemans has a sniff of goal from inside the box. But Chelsea close him down and then break at high speed, and nearly fashion a sniff of their own, down the other end. This is the kind of Sunday football email, from Richard Hirst, that I can really get behind: \u201cMuch discussion about how Spursy it would be for them to lose today. Well there are two teams involved and the Fulham equivalent of Spursy is Fulhamish. Given that last weekend we lost 4-1 at home to a team in the relegation zone, it would be very Fulhamish to win today. But if the Fulhamish/Spursy thing is for Fulham to win, then that is the expectation. So, in fact, the real Fulhamish/Spursy thing would be for Spurs to win. Clear so far? \u201cAnd now that I\u2019ve jinxed Spurs by saying they will win, Fulham will win. \u201d The Villa players were protesting that Philogene was fouled by Cucurella but their protestations were utterly futile. Goalless at Old Trafford and Tottenham Stadium. Cucurella does well to whip the ball away from Philogene with Chelsea\u2019s players in advanced areas after a set-piece. He exchanges passes with Sancho and plays a low ball into the middle, which takes a nick off a defender. Jackson tucks in a tidy finish off the near post. And that is 1-0. It\u2019s in there. 6 min: Morgan Rogers tries to make a break in midfield, down the middle, and appears to be fouled from behind. But the referee lets play continue and Chelsea can clear. Bill Leslie and Alan Smith are back with us on comms. Sancho cuts in from the Chelsea left and links with Palmer. A quiet start so far overall though. This is interesting: Chelsea are showing no interest in pressing from the front early doors. David Jones has been pressed into service as lead commentator. This is big. Sky Sports have got some audio problems so the presenter and pundits are commentating for the moment. I had some team news problems and said Bailey was starting for Villa which was wrong. Apologies. Here we go. Maresca has made 10 changes from the midweek win at Heidenheim. Jadon Sancho is the player to keep his place in the lineup. How big is three points against Aston Villa, Enzo Maresca is asked. (I live for this stuff.) \u201cIt\u2019s a big game,\u201d Maresca says. \u201cIt will be a tough game, the same as the rest. We are not focused on the top four. We are just focused on the game.\u201d Is it a formation change? \u201cIt could be. We\u2019ll see.\u201d Great, thanks for that. And why is he starting with Jadon Sancho? \u201cJadon Sancho is doing well \u2026 he was very good in the Conference League. I said many times. He\u2019s very important for us, and hopefully he can help us.\u201d Second comment on this: \u201cWhat a team. I love football hehe.\u201d Don\u2019t we all mate. The live game on a well-known sports broadcaster is Chelsea v Aston Villa. I must say that after Tottenham v Roma on Thursday, the most entertaining game I\u2019ve seen in ages, I\u2019d rather watch Spurs v Fulham. But as a wise person once said: \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d I could have sworn Micah Richards just called his fellow pundit Daniel Sturridge \u201cDave\u201d.

      "body": "<p>An aromatic blend of spices and <em>bolani</em>, stuffed pan-fried bread, and the voice of Asad Badie, an Afghan pop singer who rose to stardom in the 1980s, foreshadowed a meal experience that one could easily believe was taking place thousands of miles away.</p> <p>In reality, it was almost 1pm in Tucson, Arizona, when Ritiek Rafi and Ahmad Bahaduri started to greet and take orders from customers in Dari and English inside the only Afghan restaurant in the city.</p> <p>As Rafi and Bahaduri would say, it\u2019s like eating on a corner in Kabul \u2013 a nostalgia that inspired the name of the restaurant.</p> <p>\u201cOur language of love is food,\u201d said Rafi, a US citizen who came to Arizona as a refugee in 1999, shortly after the Taliban first seized power in Afghanistan.</p> <p>\u201cAfter the fall of Kabul in 2021, we realized that the Afghans who were being resettled here were asking, \u2018where can we have authentic Afghan food?\u2019 We thought they needed a place like this and we called it Kabul Corner.\u201d</p> <p>Kabul Corner opened its doors in September 2023, more than two years after the Taliban <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/15/the-fall-of-kabul-a-20-year-mission-collapses-in-a-single-day\">reconquered Afghanistan</a>, forcing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/16/biden-afghanistan-withdrawal-book\">chaotic withdrawal of US troops</a> from the capital. The Taliban <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/oct/09/afghan-women-exile-taliban-justice-gender-apartheid-crime-against-humanity\">quickly deprived women of basic rights</a> and threatened to kill whoever opposed its regime.</p> <p>Fearing reprisals after a 20-year US military presence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/16/kabul-airport-chaos-and-panic-as-afghans-and-foreigners-attempt-to-flee-the-capital\">tens of thousands of Afghans rushed</a> to Kabul\u2019s international airport, attempting to escape the country at any cost. The US evacuation flights were technically designed for those who assisted American forces. But in reality, those airlifted from Kabul were the lucky ones who managed to get on a flight in time. Many were left behind.</p> <p>In all, more than 77,000 Afghans have been relocated to the US under an effort dubbed Operation Allies Welcome, according to data provided by the Department of Homeland Security. Since 2021, more than 3,600 of them have settled in Arizona. That\u2019s more than the total number who arrived between 1981, when the Arizona Refugee Resettlement Program started <a href=\"https://des.az.gov/sites/default/files/Refugee_Arrivals_Report.pdf?time=1731502478357\">keeping track</a>, and 2020. According to the program, funded by the US health department, at least 1,000 Afghan immigrants live in Tucson.</p>    <p>Asked how Kabul Corner manages to offer authentic Afghan food in the second largest city in Arizona, Rafi and Bahaduri gave a quick and irrefutable answer: Enayatullah Sherzada.</p> <p>Long before the 38-year-old immigrant became the main cook at Kabul Corner, Sherzada worked for a company that supplied oil to US military bases in Afghanistan, he said.</p> <p>As the Taliban reclaimed power, Sherzada knew his involvement with the US made him a target. He rushed to the airport in Kabul and was able to get on an evacuation flight. After a rigorous screening and vetting process conducted by US intelligence officials, Sherzada arrived in Arizona in late August of 2021.</p> <p>As soon as he arrived, he filed an asylum application, which was ultimately approved and allowed him to become a permanent resident. Rafi and Bahaduri were impressed with his cooking at events for new arrivals, and he pledged to work for them if they ever opened a restaurant.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I received my green card I felt much better. My stress level went down because I had feared being sent back. Afghanistan is not a safe place,\u201d said Sherzada, with the help of Rafi, who translated for him.</p> <p>\u201cBut my parents and two brothers are still in Afghanistan. They don\u2019t have a way to get out.\u201d</p> <p>Once Afghan refugees like Sherzada are relocated to places like Tucson \u2013 which has been lauded for its efficient resettlement efforts \u2013 local resettlement agencies help them integrate into a new society. Among those agencies is the International Rescue Committee, which has assisted more than 600 Afghan evacuees in Tucson since August 2021.</p>    <p>Housing security and the language barrier are some of the challenges Afghan immigrants face upon their arrival, said Meheria Habibi, a former refugee from Afghanistan and now the deputy director at Tucson\u2019s International Rescue Committee. But the biggest challenge is family separation, Habibi concluded.</p> <p>\u201cWe have examples like this mother who got on an evacuation plane thinking that her young children and husband were also on the plane, and at the end they didn\u2019t realize that they were separated,\u201d said Habibi, who started working as an interpreter for the resettlement agency in 2002.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that many members of our community have moved their families around within Afghanistan and they are trying to get them out of there.

      "bodyText": "An aromatic blend of spices and bolani, stuffed pan-fried bread, and the voice of Asad Badie, an Afghan pop singer who rose to stardom in the 1980s, foreshadowed a meal experience that one could easily believe was taking place thousands of miles away. In reality, it was almost 1pm in Tucson, Arizona, when Ritiek Rafi and Ahmad Bahaduri started to greet and take orders from customers in Dari and English inside the only Afghan restaurant in the city. As Rafi and Bahaduri would say, it\u2019s like eating on a corner in Kabul \u2013 a nostalgia that inspired the name of the restaurant. \u201cOur language of love is food,\u201d said Rafi, a US citizen who came to Arizona as a refugee in 1999, shortly after the Taliban first seized power in Afghanistan. \u201cAfter the fall of Kabul in 2021, we realized that the Afghans who were being resettled here were asking, \u2018where can we have authentic Afghan food?\u2019 We thought they needed a place like this and we called it Kabul Corner.\u201d Kabul Corner opened its doors in September 2023, more than two years after the Taliban reconquered Afghanistan, forcing the chaotic withdrawal of US troops from the capital. The Taliban quickly deprived women of basic rights and threatened to kill whoever opposed its regime. Fearing reprisals after a 20-year US military presence, tens of thousands of Afghans rushed to Kabul\u2019s international airport, attempting to escape the country at any cost. The US evacuation flights were technically designed for those who assisted American forces. But in reality, those airlifted from Kabul were the lucky ones who managed to get on a flight in time. Many were left behind. In all, more than 77,000 Afghans have been relocated to the US under an effort dubbed Operation Allies Welcome, according to data provided by the Department of Homeland Security. Since 2021, more than 3,600 of them have settled in Arizona. That\u2019s more than the total number who arrived between 1981, when the Arizona Refugee Resettlement Program started keeping track, and 2020. According to the program, funded by the US health department, at least 1,000 Afghan immigrants live in Tucson. Asked how Kabul Corner manages to offer authentic Afghan food in the second largest city in Arizona, Rafi and Bahaduri gave a quick and irrefutable answer: Enayatullah Sherzada. Long before the 38-year-old immigrant became the main cook at Kabul Corner, Sherzada worked for a company that supplied oil to US military bases in Afghanistan, he said. As the Taliban reclaimed power, Sherzada knew his involvement with the US made him a target. He rushed to the airport in Kabul and was able to get on an evacuation flight. After a rigorous screening and vetting process conducted by US intelligence officials, Sherzada arrived in Arizona in late August of 2021. As soon as he arrived, he filed an asylum application, which was ultimately approved and allowed him to become a permanent resident. Rafi and Bahaduri were impressed with his cooking at events for new arrivals, and he pledged to work for them if they ever opened a restaurant. \u201cWhen I received my green card I felt much better. My stress level went down because I had feared being sent back. Afghanistan is not a safe place,\u201d said Sherzada, with the help of Rafi, who translated for him. \u201cBut my parents and two brothers are still in Afghanistan. They don\u2019t have a way to get out.\u201d Once Afghan refugees like Sherzada are relocated to places like Tucson \u2013 which has been lauded for its efficient resettlement efforts \u2013 local resettlement agencies help them integrate into a new society. Among those agencies is the International Rescue Committee, which has assisted more than 600 Afghan evacuees in Tucson since August 2021. Housing security and the language barrier are some of the challenges Afghan immigrants face upon their arrival, said Meheria Habibi, a former refugee from Afghanistan and now the deputy director at Tucson\u2019s International Rescue Committee. But the biggest challenge is family separation, Habibi concluded. \u201cWe have examples like this mother who got on an evacuation plane thinking that her young children and husband were also on the plane, and at the end they didn\u2019t realize that they were separated,\u201d said Habibi, who started working as an interpreter for the resettlement agency in 2002. \u201cWe know that many members of our community have moved their families around within Afghanistan and they are trying to get them out of there. And on top of that, addressing their life here, attending their jobs, making sure they\u2019re paying their bills, following up on their own applications, whether that\u2019s asylum or adjusting their parole status \u2013 it adds a lot of stress and anxiety.\u201d Habibi said that while most Afghan families in Tucson had been able to obtain legal permanent residency, many are still awaiting decisions on their requests for asylum or petitions to reunite with their relatives back in Afghanistan. *** As lunchtime hit its busiest point, the most popular dishes were brought out from the kitchen to the half a dozen of tables in the restaurant: banjan borani, or fried eggplants simmered in a spiced tomato sauce; do piaza, or lamb stew with saut\u00e9ed onions; and generous portions of basmati rice and naan. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to Americanize our food because we will lose our purpose, which is to keep the taste of our home,\u201d said Bahaduri, while bringing a dish of bolani kacholo, or fried bread stuffed with potatoes and a side of mint chutney. \u201cThat\u2019s why we make our food with Afghan ingredients only.\u201d The shelves inside the restaurant are packed with dried fruits, desserts and spices in sealed bags and containers. Kabul Corner\u2019s owners said they pay a food production company based in northern California \u2013 home to another large Afghan community \u2013 to bring authentic Afghan products to Tucson. As of 2022, the Afghan diaspora in the US was made up of approximately 250,000 individuals who were either born in Afghanistan or reported Afghan ancestry. Advocates say Afghans have been treated differently from similar refugee groups who have been offered permanent status under congressional adjustment acts \u2013 which can allow those with parole status to become permanent residents \u2013 passed by Congress, such as Cubans escaping communism, Hungarians fleeing Soviet repression and Vietnamese refugees following the fall of Saigon. The Afghan Adjustment Act received bipartisan support, but it has been stalled in Congress for more than two years. The Biden administration has created temporary avenues for those Afghans in limbo, including by extending their work permits and deportation protections under the Temporary Protected Status program. But under the new Trump administration, temporary protections are at risk. Trump has named Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump\u2019s anti-immigration policies, including the Muslim travel ban and the family separation policy, as his White House deputy chief of staff for policy. Trump has also chosen the South Dakota governor, Kristi Noem, to be his secretary of homeland security. Noem opposed resettling Afghan refugees in South Dakota in 2021, citing concerns about the adequacy of the vetting process. Meanwhile, because of the Taliban\u2019s repression and the country\u2019s economic instability, thousands of Afghans have made their way to Latin America, hoping to reach the US southern border and claim asylum on US soil. Trump has not said precisely what will happen to Afghan evacuees who have yet to receive permanent status, but he has promised to end Temporary Protected Status programs created by the Biden administration, which include the one for Afghans. *** While the community has grown exponentially in areas like northern California, Los Angeles, Washington DC, New Jersey and New York, the resettlement of Afghans in Arizona happened at a much slower pace. Rafi remembered when she arrived more than two decades ago in the US, residents, used to the mostly Latino population in Tucson, confused her with a Latina immigrant at bus stations and supermarkets. People would often speak to her in Spanish, she added. Before Bahaduri, also now a US citizen, settled in Arizona, he worked for the US government as an engineer in the reconstruction of areas affected by the conflict in Afghanistan. That qualified him for a special immigrant visa, available to those who were employed by or on behalf of the US government. In 2014, when he migrated to the US as a refugee, there were about 70 Afghan families in Tucson, and no Afghan restaurants or associations. \u201cIn 2021, we started helping them find donations, providing transportation, translation for their immigration paperwork and that\u2019s when we created a non-profit organization here, the Tucson Afghan Community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were the bridge between the newcomers and the resettlement agencies.\u201d As of 30 June 2024, nearly 60,000 applicants had submitted all the required paperwork for visas like Bahaduri\u2019s, and were awaiting initial approval to move ahead with the process, according to the US state department. But those who didn\u2019t work for the US government during the 20-year war don\u2019t qualify for the special immigrant visa. And even those who did work for Washington have struggled to obtain the visas under the program, amid vast backlogs, bureaucratic errors and a severely limited supply. Those millions of people are still living in Afghanistan under conditions that infringe on their fundamental rights. Back in Tucson, Habibi, the resettlement agency official, said given the restrictions on asylum by the Biden administration and Trump\u2019s promise to oversee mass deportations, Afghans in Tucson are constantly wondering: \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to me?\u201d \u201cWill my family have a chance to resettle in the US?\u201d \u201cAm I going to be put in a camp?\u201d Rafi and Bahaduri said those are the same concerns raised by some of the Afghan immigrants who visit Kabul Corner regularly. \u201cIt was important for us to show our people and others the culture and the hospitality of Afghans here in Tucson,\u201d Rafi said. \u201cBut we also want to let our people know that this is a safe place, somewhere they won\u2019t leave hungry, a bit of happiness.\u201d",

He is not a conspiracy theorist, he hasn\u2019t been investigated for sex trafficking. Unlike the president-elect\u2019s pick to lead the Department of Energy, he is not a fracking CEO.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a lunatic,\u201d said Patrick Donnelly, the great basin director for the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cHe\u2019s not someone wholly inappropriate for the job. But I fear the way his extractive agenda will play out in public lands.\u201d</p> \n<p>Over the next four years, Burgum is poised to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/sep/28/trump-oil-national-parks-wildlife-election\">radically remake</a> the agency that oversees 500m acres (200m hectares) of public lands, including national parks and wildlife refuges. A former software executive and one-time climate pragmatist, Burgum has become closely enmeshed with oil and gas industry executives.</p> \n<p>Burgum led the Trump campaign\u2019s development of its energy policy. After Trump asked oil executives to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/09/trump-oil-industry-campaign-money/?itid=lk_inline_manual_8\">steer $1bn</a> toward his campaign, Burgum promised them Trump would halt Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cattack\u201d on fossil fuels. As Trump makes good on his promise to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d, Burgum will be overseeing the department that expedites those drilling permits.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s going to be an effort to get every ounce of fuel out of the ground and burn it,\u201d said Daniel R Patterson, a former environmental protection specialist for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), a division of interior, who filed a whistleblower complaint during the first Trump administration. \u201cAnd if we do that, we\u2019re burning ourselves.\u201d</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Burgum had long had an affinity for Teddy Roosevelt, the US president who established the national parks system and was a champion of the outdoors. Roosevelt was from New York, but had a special connection to the Dakotas, seeking solace in the region\u2019s sweeping badlands.</p> \n<p>The 26th president was also known for his machiavellian political philosophy. \u201cTeddy Roosevelt encouraged America to speak softly and carry a big stick,\u201d Burgum said at the Republican national convention in Milwaukee. \u201cEnergy dominance will be the big stick that President Trump will carry.\u201d</p> \n<p>In addition to managing the interior department, Trump has also tasked Burgum with serving as an \u201cenergy czar\u201d, overseeing energy policy across the federal government at the helm of a new \u201cnational energy council\u201d.</p> \n<p>He will be, in essence, a fox guarding the henhouse \u2013 in a position to tear down environmental regulations, and ramp up extraction. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see a hard turn, to almost complete hostility to conservation interests,\u201d said Patterson.</p> \n<p>With Burgum at the head of the department, Patterson added, \u201cthe direction from DC is going to be to permit as much resource exploitation as possible. And interior employees are going to be asked to push the boundaries of the law more.\u201d</p> \n<p>Burgum\u2019s zeal for extraction \u2013 and his focus on ramping up oil and gas production \u2013 could make him more efficient and effective than Trump\u2019s previous interior secretaries. Trump\u2019s first interior leader, Ryan Zinke, racked up <a href=\"https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/a-guide-to-the-14-federal-investigations-into-ryan-zinke/\">18 ethics</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/16/ryan-zinke-trump-interior-secretary-misused-position-watchdog\">investigations</a> in just under two years. His replacement David Bernhardt was also dogged by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/climate/bernhardt-interior-department-ethics-investigation.html\">allegations</a> of ethics violations \u2013 and was investigated for carrying on his work as an oil industry lobbyist even after he joined the administration.</p> \n<p>Burgum\u2019s relatively short political career has not been without scandal. During his short-lived presidential bid, he <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doug-burgum-president-campaign-gift-cards-20-donations-legal-experts/\">drew attention for offering $20 gift cards to people who would donate $1 </a>to his campaign, so he would have enough individual donors to make the Republican primary debate stage. But until quite recently, Burgum was viewed as a relative moderate.</p> \n<p>Initially, he was known for his bipartisanship and pragmatism. Tribal leaders in North Dakota have credited him with <a href=\"https://alaskabeacon.com/2024/11/19/north-dakota-tribal-leaders-see-burgum-as-ally-in-interior-energy-role/\">smoothing tenuous</a> relationships between tribal and state governments, and though he urged the federal government to take quicker action to clear out protesters of the Dakota Access Pipeline, he advocated <a href=\"https://northdakotamonitor.com/2024/02/26/testimony-shows-burgum-didnt-want-dapl-to-escalate-into-a-standoff/\">against using force</a> after taking over as governor toward the end of the standoff.</p> \n<p>He was never a progressive champion of climate action \u2013 but he promoted the same \u201call of the above\u201d approach to energy that Democratic administration have supported, backing North Dakota\u2019s powerful oil and gas industry while also encouraging the development of renewable energy infrastructure. In 2021, he set a goal that North Dakota would stop adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2030, becoming \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d \u2013 advocating for a plan that retained the state\u2019s fossil fuel industries while investing in carbon capture and storage technologies to offset emissions. At the time, environmental groups supported Burgum\u2019s pledge, but noted the impracticality of relying on unproven carbon capture technology rather than a transition away from fossil fuels.</p> \n<p>But in the past year and a half, Burgum underwent a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/07/05/doug-burgum-north-dakota-vice-president-candidate-00166496\">Maga conversion</a>, becoming one of Donald Trump\u2019s closest advisers on energy policy, coordinating closely with oil industry executives.</p> \n<p>* * *</p> \n<p>At a now infamous meeting between Trump and oil executives were Burgum and Harold Hamm \u2013 the head of Oklahoma-based energy company Continental Resources. The two men are close allies in politics and business.</p> \n<p>Hamm has donated to Burgum\u2019s political campaigns ($250,000 to his presidential bid), and help finance his pet projects (<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/politics-harold-hamm-north-dakota-doug-burgum-bismarck-1ee63c80b17c218f19337719de94131d\">giving $50m </a>to fund the Theodore Roosevelt library in North Dakota). His Continental Resources, which is the largest oil and gas leaseholder in North Dakota, also leases land from Burgum\u2019s family for oil and gas extraction.</p> \n<p>And their chumminess blossomed as Hamm, who has become one of Trump\u2019s biggest benefactors and advisers, reportedly helped talk up Burgum at Mar-a-Lago.

      "bodyText": "Of all Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees so far, Doug Burgum has stood out for appearing to be one of the most conventional. The billionaire governor of North Dakota \u2013 like most picks to lead the Department of the Interior, the largest landowner in the US west \u2013 comes from a western state. He is not a conspiracy theorist, he hasn\u2019t been investigated for sex trafficking. Unlike the president-elect\u2019s pick to lead the Department of Energy, he is not a fracking CEO. \u201cHe\u2019s not a lunatic,\u201d said Patrick Donnelly, the great basin director for the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cHe\u2019s not someone wholly inappropriate for the job. But I fear the way his extractive agenda will play out in public lands.\u201d Over the next four years, Burgum is poised to radically remake the agency that oversees 500m acres (200m hectares) of public lands, including national parks and wildlife refuges. A former software executive and one-time climate pragmatist, Burgum has become closely enmeshed with oil and gas industry executives. Burgum led the Trump campaign\u2019s development of its energy policy. After Trump asked oil executives to steer $1bn toward his campaign, Burgum promised them Trump would halt Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cattack\u201d on fossil fuels. As Trump makes good on his promise to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d, Burgum will be overseeing the department that expedites those drilling permits. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be an effort to get every ounce of fuel out of the ground and burn it,\u201d said Daniel R Patterson, a former environmental protection specialist for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), a division of interior, who filed a whistleblower complaint during the first Trump administration. \u201cAnd if we do that, we\u2019re burning ourselves.\u201d *** Burgum had long had an affinity for Teddy Roosevelt, the US president who established the national parks system and was a champion of the outdoors. Roosevelt was from New York, but had a special connection to the Dakotas, seeking solace in the region\u2019s sweeping badlands. The 26th president was also known for his machiavellian political philosophy. \u201cTeddy Roosevelt encouraged America to speak softly and carry a big stick,\u201d Burgum said at the Republican national convention in Milwaukee. \u201cEnergy dominance will be the big stick that President Trump will carry.\u201d In addition to managing the interior department, Trump has also tasked Burgum with serving as an \u201cenergy czar\u201d, overseeing energy policy across the federal government at the helm of a new \u201cnational energy council\u201d. He will be, in essence, a fox guarding the henhouse \u2013 in a position to tear down environmental regulations, and ramp up extraction. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see a hard turn, to almost complete hostility to conservation interests,\u201d said Patterson. With Burgum at the head of the department, Patterson added, \u201cthe direction from DC is going to be to permit as much resource exploitation as possible. And interior employees are going to be asked to push the boundaries of the law more.\u201d Burgum\u2019s zeal for extraction \u2013 and his focus on ramping up oil and gas production \u2013 could make him more efficient and effective than Trump\u2019s previous interior secretaries. Trump\u2019s first interior leader, Ryan Zinke, racked up 18 ethics investigations in just under two years. His replacement David Bernhardt was also dogged by allegations of ethics violations \u2013 and was investigated for carrying on his work as an oil industry lobbyist even after he joined the administration. Burgum\u2019s relatively short political career has not been without scandal. During his short-lived presidential bid, he drew attention for offering $20 gift cards to people who would donate $1 to his campaign, so he would have enough individual donors to make the Republican primary debate stage. But until quite recently, Burgum was viewed as a relative moderate. Initially, he was known for his bipartisanship and pragmatism. Tribal leaders in North Dakota have credited him with smoothing tenuous relationships between tribal and state governments, and though he urged the federal government to take quicker action to clear out protesters of the Dakota Access Pipeline, he advocated against using force after taking over as governor toward the end of the standoff. He was never a progressive champion of climate action \u2013 but he promoted the same \u201call of the above\u201d approach to energy that Democratic administration have supported, backing North Dakota\u2019s powerful oil and gas industry while also encouraging the development of renewable energy infrastructure. In 2021, he set a goal that North Dakota would stop adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2030, becoming \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d \u2013 advocating for a plan that retained the state\u2019s fossil fuel industries while investing in carbon capture and storage technologies to offset emissions. At the time, environmental groups supported Burgum\u2019s pledge, but noted the impracticality of relying on unproven carbon capture technology rather than a transition away from fossil fuels. But in the past year and a half, Burgum underwent a Maga conversion, becoming one of Donald Trump\u2019s closest advisers on energy policy, coordinating closely with oil industry executives. * * * At a now infamous meeting between Trump and oil executives were Burgum and Harold Hamm \u2013 the head of Oklahoma-based energy company Continental Resources. The two men are close allies in politics and business. Hamm has donated to Burgum\u2019s political campaigns ($250,000 to his presidential bid), and help finance his pet projects (giving $50m to fund the Theodore Roosevelt library in North Dakota). His Continental Resources, which is the largest oil and gas leaseholder in North Dakota, also leases land from Burgum\u2019s family for oil and gas extraction. And their chumminess blossomed as Hamm, who has become one of Trump\u2019s biggest benefactors and advisers, reportedly helped talk up Burgum at Mar-a-Lago. As a profile of Hamm in the industry publication Hart Energy asserts: \u201cWhen Harold Hamm talks US energy, President-Elect Donald Trump listens.\u201d Burgum and Hamm worked in tandem to shore up support for Trump among industry executives. And a now infamous meeting with executives where Trump asked for $1bn in support, Burgum promised that if elected, Trump would \u201cstop the hostile attack against all American energy\u201d on \u201cday one\u201d, according to a recording obtained by the Washington Post. In his dual role as energy czar and interior secretary, environmentalists are bracing for him to gut regulations and speed-up permitting in ecologically vulnerable regions \u2013 further opening up the Arctic national wildlife refuge in Alaska for oil and gas exploration, or welcoming uranium and coal development in areas bordering the Grand Canyon. Trump has given Burgum one diktat: drill. Conservationists fear Burgum is likely to oblige not with sweeping action, but by way of a thousand cuts to environmental rules and regulations, allowing not only oil and gas companies, but also mining companies and other businesses unencumbered access to public lands. \u201cThe reality is, BLM approves everything that comes in front of them, and that\u2019s true no matter who is present in the White House,\u201d said Donnelly of the Center for Biological Diversity. Of greater concern, he said, is how that permitting happens. \u201cThat\u2019s something I really fear, because the ramifications of the first Trump administration are still extremely present in our lives,\u201d he said. During his first administration, Trump oversaw the rollback of more than 125 environmental rules, many with the aid of the interior department, whose secretary will wield vast power over how environmental regulations are interpreted and implemented. For example, the BLM created new rules to roll back restrictions on methane releases from oil and gas wells. A US district court eventually found the rule to be flawed, but then a Wyoming court struck down Obama-era restrictions on methane that preceded the Trump rule. All the while, companies were allowed to release methane unfettered. Burgum could also help Trump gut the interior department, reducing staff at key offices that oversee vast areas of public land \u2013 undermining the department\u2019s ability to monitor public lands and enforce regulations. Career interior employees may also choose to retire or leave. \u201cPublic employees largely do these jobs because they believe in the public interest,\u201d said Patterson. \u201cIf a new political boss comes in and tries to turn the agency into a giant bulldozer to pave the way for moneyed interests, they may not want to be a part of that.\u201d There were 4,900 fewer employees at the interior department at the end of Trump\u2019s first term compared to the beginning. \u201cWe know there\u2019s a big emphasis and thrust of the incoming administration on reducing the size of the federal government, and we worry that BLM will once again be in the crosshairs,\u201d said Robert Dewey, vice-president for government relations with the non-profit group Defenders of Wildlife. \u201cIf it is targeted, that would have an impact on their ability to balance conservation along with their other objectives.

Nobody tracked Fern\u00e1ndez and the midfielder jabbed a swerving shot past Mart\u00ednez from the edge of the area. Game over? Pretty much. Villa, who replaced the injured Mart\u00ednez with Robin Olsen, had a couple of forays but they look a shadow of their former selves. Has the Champions League worn them out? \u201cWe are not a surprise like last year,\u201d Emery said. Nor are they as consistent as Chelsea. They pushed for a third, Jackson shooting over, and got it when Noni Madueke found Palmer after coming off the bench. Palmer had worked hard off the ball and here was his reward: a left-foot shot that arced beyond Olsen from 25 yards, hammering home Chelsea\u2019s supremacy.",

The two companies \u2013 the UK\u2019s biggest insurer, Aviva, and the Churchill owner, Direct Line, known for motor cover and its red phone on wheels mascot \u2013 are facing off in a takeover tussle that has sent the Direct Line share price soaring, amid speculation that Aviva could raise its offer or launch a hostile bid, or face a counterbid. Winslow, who took the helm at Direct Line in March, joining from Aviva, claimed the new management team was \u201cmaking excellent progress in the early stages of a significant turnaround\u201d. He told the Sunday Times that Direct Line had \u201cgreat brands\u201d and was better off pushing ahead on its own with a \u201ca strong standalone story and clear path to create shareholder value\u201d. Direct Line last week rejected a non-binding proposal from Aviva worth 250p a share, made up of cash and Aviva shares, saying it was \u201chighly opportunistic and substantially undervalued the company\u201d, and has declined to engage further with the Aviva board. Direct Line\u2019s chair, Danuta Gray, met the Aviva chair, George Culmer, last week to explain why the company could not accept a proposal that low. Aviva, run by Dame Amanda Blanc, has been on a charm offensive, talking to a number of Direct Line shareholders to persuade them of the merits of its approach, and to get them to encourage the board to engage in talks. Several are also investors in Aviva, including Schroders, Fidelity, Redwheel and M&amp;G. Shares in FTSE 250-listed Direct Line jumped by 41% on Thursday after news of Aviva\u2019s approach, and closed a further 4.6% higher on Friday at 234.8p, up 10.4p. Aviva needs to raise its offer by \u201cseveral hundred million pounds\u201d, according to Sir Peter Wood \u2013 the Royal Bank of Scotland executive who founded Direct Line in Croydon in 1985 and revolutionised car insurance with the simple notion of cutting out the middleman, the broker, and selling direct, by phone. Wood told the Mail on Sunday that Direct Line had lost its way, and that it would take Winslow three to four years to turn the company around. Analysts said there was scope for Aviva to raise its offer to 270p a share by increasing the share component of the deal, with some talking of 300p a share. It is the second time this year that Direct Line has faced an unwanted suitor. The Kent-based company, which owns the Churchill, Green Flag and Darwin brands, rejected two takeover proposals from the Belgian insurance group Ageas in February and March, valuing it at \u00a33.2bn. Analysts said there could be a counterbid from Ageas. It is one of the largest car insurers in the UK and has more than 4 million customers across car, home, travel and business insurance. Its chief executive, Hans de Cuyper, said in October that Ageas was open to making further bids for UK companies. Winslow\u2019s management team includes other ex-Aviva colleagues, Jane Poole, now Direct Line\u2019s chief financial officer, and Maz Bown, its chief risk officer. Winslow has announced 550 job cuts as part of a \u00a3100m cost savings programme after a smaller-than-expected return to profit in September. The proposed takeover could raise competition concerns and mean higher prices for customers, according to James Daley, the managing director of the consumer group Fairer Finance.

Alex Mackenzie, an analyst at BNP Paribas Exane, estimates that Direct Line has a 12% share of the motor market, behind the market leader Admiral, and 10% in home insurance, \u201cand so we expect that anti-trust constraints will be limited\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Papa No\u00ebl, who has died aged 83, was a songwriter and guitar hero during the golden age of Congolese music from the 1950s to the 70s, when rumba and soukous dominated the African music scene. The electric guitar played a key role in the charming, lilting, Cuban-influenced dance music that emerged from a country battered by corruption and fighting, and No\u00ebl was known for a style that was elegant and technically brilliant, with a quick-fingered virtuosity that was light and never over-flashy.</p> <p>He played with a remarkable array of bands, both in L\u00e9opoldville (known as Kinshasa after 1966) and across the river in the neighbouring country of Congo-Brazzaville, working with the two key figures in Congolese music, Joseph Kabasele (le Grand Kall\u00e9), leader of the band African Jazz, and Franco, a guitarist who ran the massively successful OK Jazz. </p> <p>No\u00ebl became famed for his guitar work alongside Franco, which showed off their contrasting styles \u2013 Franco often taking a heavier, more aggressive approach. After Franco\u2019s death he moved to Europe, where he continued to promote classic Congolese rumba, also playing acoustic guitar while working with musicians from Cuba and France as well as veterans from what had then been renamed Zaire.</p> <p>Born Antoine Monswet<em> </em>in L\u00e9opoldville, then the capital of the Belgian Congo (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), he grew up listening to <em>son cubano</em> music played on the much-prized phonograph owned by his mother, a shopkeeper. He never discussed his father, who was from Brazzaville, but did say that his grandmother bought him his first guitar, and that he taught himself to play, learning Cuban styles, Django Reinhardt pieces (with help from the Belgian jazz guitarist Bill Alexandre), and the early rumba songs released by the fledgling Congolese recording industry. </p> <p>Gradually he got to know the new rumba stars, who were impressed by his talent, and at 16 he made his first recording, playing alongside his idol Leon Bukasa on his hit Clara Badimuene. But in 1958 he quit to join Rock-a-Mambo, working alongside former members of OK Jazz. In 1960, the year of Congolese independence, he moved to Brazzaville to play with another successful band, Orchestre Bantou, which included more former members of OK Jazz.</p> <p>By 1962 he was back in L\u00e9opoldville, where he joined Kabasele in Orchestre African Jazz, replacing Docteur Nico (Nico Kasanda), widely regarded as the finest Congolese guitarist of the era. No\u00ebl fitted in well, but in 1968 he left to form his own band, Orchestre Bamboula. He did not enjoy the administrative work, so went back to playing in a succession of other bands.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>In 2013 he released Color, a 'duo rumbaccordion' set with the French accordion player Viviane Arnoux</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Then in 1978 he was invited by Franco to join what was now called Tout Puissant OK Jazz. It was another successful move, with Franco at times allowing him to share the lead guitar role, and to provide songs for the band. These included the 1982 hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PweWnbl6qAo\">Tangawizi</a>, the story of a marriage break-up as seen from the viewpoints of both women involved. He toured widely with TPOK Jazz in Africa and Europe \u2013 but there was a downside in playing with such a high-profile band. Soon after No\u00ebl had joined, Franco was jailed in Zaire for what were considered obscene lyrics to the songs Helene and Jacky. Some band members, including No\u00ebl, were also locked up for three weeks, before being released on a presidential pardon.</p> <p>There was further trouble in 1984, when No\u00ebl crossed to Brazzaville to record his first solo album, Bon Samaritain, which consisted of his own compositions and proved to be a major success. Franco was furious that he hadn\u2019t been told, and No\u00ebl expected to be fired. But he stayed on, and Franco even invited No\u00ebl\u2019s singer, Carlyto Lassa, to join TPOK Jazz.</p> <p>After Franco\u2019s death in 1989 No\u00ebl recorded an album with surviving band members in Zaire before moving to Europe to keep the classic rumba style alive. In 1994 he recorded a second solo album of his own songs, Haute Tension (again with Lassa) in Paris, and in 1998 played on Galo Negro, an album by the former TPOK singer Sam Mangwana, and became the director of Mangwana\u2019s touring band. In 2000 No\u00ebl gave a celebrated \u201cunplugged\u201d performance at Womad in the UK, alongside the Congolese guitarists Mose Fan Fan and Syran Mbenza. The following year he played on Rumba Congo, the debut album by K\u00e9k\u00e9le, a band of seasoned veterans that was seen as the country\u2019s answer to Cuba\u2019s Buena Vista Social Club.</p> <p>Wanting to explore rumba\u2019s Cuban roots, he also recorded with the Cuban singer-songwriter Adan Pedroso and travelled to Havana to work with the Cuban tres player Papi Oviedo. Their acoustic album Bana Congo was released in 2002.

      "bodyText": "Papa No\u00ebl, who has died aged 83, was a songwriter and guitar hero during the golden age of Congolese music from the 1950s to the 70s, when rumba and soukous dominated the African music scene. The electric guitar played a key role in the charming, lilting, Cuban-influenced dance music that emerged from a country battered by corruption and fighting, and No\u00ebl was known for a style that was elegant and technically brilliant, with a quick-fingered virtuosity that was light and never over-flashy. He played with a remarkable array of bands, both in L\u00e9opoldville (known as Kinshasa after 1966) and across the river in the neighbouring country of Congo-Brazzaville, working with the two key figures in Congolese music, Joseph Kabasele (le Grand Kall\u00e9), leader of the band African Jazz, and Franco, a guitarist who ran the massively successful OK Jazz. No\u00ebl became famed for his guitar work alongside Franco, which showed off their contrasting styles \u2013 Franco often taking a heavier, more aggressive approach. After Franco\u2019s death he moved to Europe, where he continued to promote classic Congolese rumba, also playing acoustic guitar while working with musicians from Cuba and France as well as veterans from what had then been renamed Zaire. Born Antoine Monswet in L\u00e9opoldville, then the capital of the Belgian Congo (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), he grew up listening to son cubano music played on the much-prized phonograph owned by his mother, a shopkeeper. He never discussed his father, who was from Brazzaville, but did say that his grandmother bought him his first guitar, and that he taught himself to play, learning Cuban styles, Django Reinhardt pieces (with help from the Belgian jazz guitarist Bill Alexandre), and the early rumba songs released by the fledgling Congolese recording industry. Gradually he got to know the new rumba stars, who were impressed by his talent, and at 16 he made his first recording, playing alongside his idol Leon Bukasa on his hit Clara Badimuene. But in 1958 he quit to join Rock-a-Mambo, working alongside former members of OK Jazz. In 1960, the year of Congolese independence, he moved to Brazzaville to play with another successful band, Orchestre Bantou, which included more former members of OK Jazz. By 1962 he was back in L\u00e9opoldville, where he joined Kabasele in Orchestre African Jazz, replacing Docteur Nico (Nico Kasanda), widely regarded as the finest Congolese guitarist of the era. No\u00ebl fitted in well, but in 1968 he left to form his own band, Orchestre Bamboula. He did not enjoy the administrative work, so went back to playing in a succession of other bands. Then in 1978 he was invited by Franco to join what was now called Tout Puissant OK Jazz. It was another successful move, with Franco at times allowing him to share the lead guitar role, and to provide songs for the band. These included the 1982 hit Tangawizi, the story of a marriage break-up as seen from the viewpoints of both women involved. He toured widely with TPOK Jazz in Africa and Europe \u2013 but there was a downside in playing with such a high-profile band. Soon after No\u00ebl had joined, Franco was jailed in Zaire for what were considered obscene lyrics to the songs Helene and Jacky. Some band members, including No\u00ebl, were also locked up for three weeks, before being released on a presidential pardon. There was further trouble in 1984, when No\u00ebl crossed to Brazzaville to record his first solo album, Bon Samaritain, which consisted of his own compositions and proved to be a major success. Franco was furious that he hadn\u2019t been told, and No\u00ebl expected to be fired. But he stayed on, and Franco even invited No\u00ebl\u2019s singer, Carlyto Lassa, to join TPOK Jazz. After Franco\u2019s death in 1989 No\u00ebl recorded an album with surviving band members in Zaire before moving to Europe to keep the classic rumba style alive. In 1994 he recorded a second solo album of his own songs, Haute Tension (again with Lassa) in Paris, and in 1998 played on Galo Negro, an album by the former TPOK singer Sam Mangwana, and became the director of Mangwana\u2019s touring band. In 2000 No\u00ebl gave a celebrated \u201cunplugged\u201d performance at Womad in the UK, alongside the Congolese guitarists Mose Fan Fan and Syran Mbenza. The following year he played on Rumba Congo, the debut album by K\u00e9k\u00e9le, a band of seasoned veterans that was seen as the country\u2019s answer to Cuba\u2019s Buena Vista Social Club. Wanting to explore rumba\u2019s Cuban roots, he also recorded with the Cuban singer-songwriter Adan Pedroso and travelled to Havana to work with the Cuban tres player Papi Oviedo. Their acoustic album Bana Congo was released in 2002. Five years later he recorded a new solo album, Caf\u00e9 Noir, in which he was joined by a cast that included Cuban musicians and the Cameroonian saxophonist Manu Dibango. In 2013 he released Color, a \u201cduo rumbaccordion\u201d set with the French accordion player Viviane Arnoux, who had worked with him on the Mangwana and K\u00e9k\u00e9le projects, and with whom he toured in France and South Africa. She described him as \u201cfun, interesting, happy to teach me his culture \u2026 sometimes difficult because he had a strong character, but very human\u201d. It was widely accepted that Papa No\u00ebl was given his stage name because he was born on Christmas Day \u2013 a story he encouraged. But he also told friends that he had been born on 29 December \u2013 confirmed by his wife as the correct date \u2013 and that he took it because No\u00ebl is the backwards spelling of Leon, a tribute to Leon Bukasa. He is survived by Danielle \u201cDadie\u201d Nedule Monswet (nee Rosso), a French painter whom he married in 1992, and by seven children from two earlier marriages. \u2022 Antoine Nedule Monswet (Papa No\u00ebl), guitarist and songwriter, born 29 December 1940; died 11 November 2024",

His writing, in several languages and on a head-spinning array of topics, sprawls into dozens of volumes within which a reader may easily feel disoriented and intimidated. Kempe\u2019s response to this challenge is ingenious and twofold. First, rather than downplaying the scale and eccentricity of Leibniz\u2019s achievement, he celebrates it as the feature that paradoxically speaks to the modern moment the most clearly. Second, even as he relishes Leibniz\u2019s insatiable curiosity and prolixity, the form of the biography is designed to make it manageable in scale. Rather than seeking to cover the whole of a complex and restless life, Kempe gives us \u201cseven pivotal days\u201d when Leibniz\u2019s movements and his acts of writing can be pinned down with some precision, and where we can see some of his key insights \u2013 such as the formulation of differential calculus, credit for which he disputed throughout his life with Newton and his followers \u2013 begin to crystallise.</p> <p>The virtue of this approach lies in the fact that it is not arbitrary: the form of the biography is part of the argument that Kempe wants to make about its subject.

Leibniz loved concocting beautiful metaphors to explain this idea, such as the <em>bruit de la mer</em>, the roar of the sea, in which the loud crashing of a wave is made up of many small waves producing sounds too tiny to be audible to human ears.

He is, instead, the great philosopher of the possible; the thinker who sees the surface of reality as rippling with possibilities, not all of which will achieve the privilege of being realised. This was true for Leibniz himself, who left an abundance of unfinished projects, and many of whose schemes for personal advancement and attempts to effect practical and political change came to nought. Kempe\u2019s affinity and admiration for his subject, his determination to celebrate his restless effusiveness, is winning, even if the enthusiasm can become, at times, rather too breathless: descriptions such as \u201cwords and ideas just poured out him\u201d recur more often than necessary, giving the book its own tendency to gush.

      "body": "<p>The House of Commons\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/29/mps-vote-for-assisted-dying-in-england-and-wales\">backing of the assisted dying bill</a> for England and Wales was a historic moment but just the first step in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/29/what-happens-next-assisted-dying-bill\">long process</a>.</p> <p>One thing that was clear is that many MPs hope to see significant amendments to the bill that they voted on. That includes some MPs who voted in favour of Kim Leadbeater\u2019s bill but only because they anticipate that lingering concerns they have will be dealt with before it becomes law.</p> <p>So what are the amendments likely to be proposed and which could be made to the final bill?</p>  <h2>Beefing up safeguarding and preventing coercion</h2>  <p>One of the key issues for many who voted against the bill is that vulnerable people, particularly those with disabilities, could choose an assisted death to avoid being a burden on their family, including because of the cost of care. There are also concerns about people being coerced into making the choice. Critics believe that the bill\u2019s restriction of assisted dying to mentally competent adults diagnosed with a terminal illness and expected to have six months or less to live, and its requirement for medical and judicial oversight, are insufficient.</p> <p>One of the suggestions is to amend the bill to state that assisted dying must never be raised initially by medical practitioners and should be patient-led. Another is to introduce a review or reversal process, without which the fear is that victims of coercive control will not have any recourse. Marie Tidball, a Labour MP who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/24/mum-state-labour-candidate-disabled-oxford\">born with a congenital disability</a> that affects all four limbs, called for \u201cdishonesty\u201d, \u201ccoercion\u201d and \u201cpressure\u201d to be properly defined in the final bill.</p> <h2>Improving judicial and medical oversight</h2>  <p>As the bill stands, a request for assisted dying would have to be signed off by two doctors and a high court judge, but there are concerns at the lack of detail surrounding this. There have been calls for the bill to specify training required for medical practitioners and judges, particularly so they can identify signs of coercion. Additionally, some want doctors who approve the necessary medication to have a special licence.</p> <h2>Addressing the risk of a 'slippery slope'</h2>  <p>Another major concern with the bill is the slippery slope argument. This is the theory that once assisted dying is introduced it will become normalised in the eyes of the public and MPs and will inevitably be extended with fewer restrictions.

      "bodyText": "The House of Commons\u2019 backing of the assisted dying bill for England and Wales was a historic moment but just the first step in a long process. One thing that was clear is that many MPs hope to see significant amendments to the bill that they voted on. That includes some MPs who voted in favour of Kim Leadbeater\u2019s bill but only because they anticipate that lingering concerns they have will be dealt with before it becomes law. So what are the amendments likely to be proposed and which could be made to the final bill? Beefing up safeguarding and preventing coercion One of the key issues for many who voted against the bill is that vulnerable people, particularly those with disabilities, could choose an assisted death to avoid being a burden on their family, including because of the cost of care. There are also concerns about people being coerced into making the choice. Critics believe that the bill\u2019s restriction of assisted dying to mentally competent adults diagnosed with a terminal illness and expected to have six months or less to live, and its requirement for medical and judicial oversight, are insufficient. One of the suggestions is to amend the bill to state that assisted dying must never be raised initially by medical practitioners and should be patient-led. Another is to introduce a review or reversal process, without which the fear is that victims of coercive control will not have any recourse. Marie Tidball, a Labour MP who was born with a congenital disability that affects all four limbs, called for \u201cdishonesty\u201d, \u201ccoercion\u201d and \u201cpressure\u201d to be properly defined in the final bill. Improving judicial and medical oversight As the bill stands, a request for assisted dying would have to be signed off by two doctors and a high court judge, but there are concerns at the lack of detail surrounding this. There have been calls for the bill to specify training required for medical practitioners and judges, particularly so they can identify signs of coercion. Additionally, some want doctors who approve the necessary medication to have a special licence. Addressing the risk of a 'slippery slope' Another major concern with the bill is the slippery slope argument. This is the theory that once assisted dying is introduced it will become normalised in the eyes of the public and MPs and will inevitably be extended with fewer restrictions. There has been a suggestion that some MPs want some kind of protection within the bill to prevent \u2013 or at least create stiff obstacles to \u2013 this happening. It is difficult to see how this would be achieved as parliament cannot make laws that would restrict future parliaments. Investment in palliative care In Friday\u2019s debate there were calls from MPs on both sides of the debate for the inadequate funding for palliative care and postcode lottery to be addressed. While the way to do this does not rest within the bill, many believe it is an issue that must be addressed in tandem with it, to ensure that if assisted dying is made legal, people will not be choosing it solely because they do not have access to proper palliative care, which could alleviate their suffering. Could the eligibility criteria actually be extended? Some have suggested that Leadbeater\u2019s bill is too narrow and have questioned why it should not be extended, for example to people with a terminal illness with more than six months to live or people living unbearable pain but who do not have a terminal illness. However, given how tight the vote was and the concerns raised by opponents, extending the eligibility criteria before it becomes law looks like a non-starter.",

      "body": "<p>Elizabeth Hughes Gossett shouldn\u2019t have survived beyond 11, the age at which she developed type 1 diabetes. Born in Albany, New York, Gossett received her diagnosis in 1918 when diabetes had no known treatment. Tragically, her life expectancy was just a matter of months. Her parents desperately searched for any way to keep their daughter alive. A New Jersey physician had developed a radical course of action: keeping the blood sugar levels of diabetic children low by feeding them the bare minimum needed to survive. This could see a prognosis of months extended to years. These young patients weren\u2019t exactly <em>living, </em>but they were alive.</p> <p>In the spring of 1919, Gossett went into this starvation clinic. She\u2019d have been constantly cold and hungry. Emaciated, unable to move or grow. At its lowest, her weight dropped to 20kg. Three years later, Gossett was lingering on death\u2019s threshold but, crucially, hadn\u2019t crossed to the other side.</p> <p>\u201cAnd as result,\u201d Dr Ariel Zeleznikow-Johnston explains to me, \u201cshe was still alive when, in 1921, what had hitherto seemed impossible was achieved: insulin treatment was developed.\u201d Gossett received her first injection of the hormone in 1922 and started to eat again, move again, <em>live </em>again. She survived into her 70s, taking about 42,000 insulin shots in that time.</p> <p>\u201cYou see,\u201d Zeleznikow-Johnston says, \u201cfor millions of years, people just died from diabetes, something that was thought to be inevitable. Unchangeable. Then suddenly, from nowhere, this was no longer true.\u201d In Gossett\u2019s case, there was a limbo period: years between her diagnosis and a treatment becoming available. \u201cIn 1918, most kids diagnosed with type 1 diabetes died. Elizabeth didn\u2019t, because the pause button was pressed and, as a result, a future was bought for her. That\u2019s what I\u2019m advocating for.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s this idea which lies at the heart of Zeleznikow-Johnston\u2019s new book, <em>The Future Loves You: How and Why We Should Abolish Death</em>. A manifesto for \u2013 and road map to, he hopes \u2013 today\u2019s terminally diseased and dying being offered a pause button of their own. A chance to halt their biological clocks, until such a time that science and medicine has advanced sufficiently. Maybe, even, the prospect of immortality. He\u2019s convinced the technology already exists to make much of this possible, and costs little more than a midrange secondhand car.</p> <p>Zeleznikow-Johnston, 31, is a research fellow at Melbourne\u2019s Monash University. \u201cI\u2019ve been interested in neuroscience forever,\u201d he says, from his recently acquired, bright, campus office. \u201cIt\u2019s the confluence of biology \u2013 the wet mechanics \u2013 of how cells and neurons work, philosophical questions of identity, and the fun, cognitive mechanics of how the brain functions.\u201d You know that feeling of having a word on the tip of your tongue, but can\u2019t quite get it? \u201cWorking out what\u2019s happening there,\u201d he says, \u201cis basically my day job. Exploring how brains give rise to consciousness.\u201d</p>    <p>He\u2019s also interested in the history of medical progress and where the future lies. \u201cLogically, where we can expect this technology to be in 10, 20, 100 years from now. That\u2019s what took me to the prospect of preservation: how we might still be around in decades and centuries to come.\u201d In other words, could we give ourselves a shot at making use of medicine\u2019s far-off advances? \u201cWith the advent of brain preservation,\u201d he writes, \u201cI don\u2019t think that you, or anyone you love, has to die at all.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>First, though, a much simpler</strong></em> question: would you even want life eternal? So outlandish is the notion, you\u2019ve likely given it little thought. In his line of work, it\u2019s a topic Zeleznikow-Johnston finds himself grappling with regularly. \u201cReminders that my brain and body are constantly decaying,\u201d he says, \u201ccan become a bit much from time to time; it can feel heightened. And I\u2019ve always been suspicious that our societal acceptance of death comes from an inability to imagine anything otherwise.\u201d It\u2019s a hunch, he says, that\u2019s not purely anecdotal: scientific literature, he mentions, backs him up.</p> <p>\u201cStudies show that if you survey people across all ages,\u201d he says, \u201cand ask how long they\u2019d like to live for, most only ask for five to 10 years longer than their demographic is statistically likely to get: 90, let\u2019s say.\u201d Zeleznikow-Johnston believes this presents an incomplete picture.</p> <p>Research also shows these answers change when it\u2019s stipulated that respondents would be guaranteed good mental and physical health into their later decades. \u201cImmediately the figure jumps: 120 years, 150, longer. And there\u2019s a strong correlation between someone\u2019s age and how long they say they want to live for: the older you get, the further away you want the deadline. When you survey terminally ill people, in hospices and on their deathbed, the vast majority still have a very strong will to live. In most circumstances, I\u2019d argue, people would like to live longer, but feel it\u2019s not possible.\u201d In essence, as our deadline approaches, few people actually want to die.</p>    <p>It\u2019s a divergence from much received wisdom. Twentieth-century thinkers like Bernard Williams and Viktor Frankl posited that death gives life meaning. It\u2019s an argument Zeleznikow-Johnston offers short shrift. \u201cSome say we need death because it sets a deadline to achieve goals,\u201d he says, \u201cbut that\u2019s not compelling.\u201d In his book, he rejects, too, suggested environmental and social benefits of dying, too.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s less that there are strong arguments why death is good,\u201d he argues, \u201cbut what I call palliative philosophy: death is inevitable, we want convincing reasons as to why that\u2019s good, so we create them. In fact, we spend vast amounts globally on healthcare and medical research.\u201d It makes up 10% of global economic activity. \u201cModern medicine is really the practice of trying to keep death at bay. But we haven\u2019t yet acknowledged or agreed \u2013 as a society \u2013 that the end goal of medical research is actually to eliminate disease completely.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the early 2000s,\u201d he says, \u201cspecialists were pushing for urgent debates about AI capability and safety. There was no timeline, but they warned of what was coming.\u201d Their pleas weren\u2019t heeded. \u201cFrom 2012, AI exploded. Wider society hadn\u2019t talked about it, and now we\u2019re under-equipped and under-prepared.\u201d Zeleznikow-Johnston suspects a similar revolution in mortality is creeping up on us. Even if you dismiss the rest of what he\u2019s advocating, he says, on the topic of \u201cdefeating death: good or bad?\u201d we ought to make up our minds. Presuming we opt for the former, Zeleznikow-Johnston reckons he might just have a plan.</p> <p><em><strong>Before grappling with the</strong></em> practicalities of extending our lifespans, consider its foundations, he says. \u201cOnly when we understand what it is to die, can we consider what it means to keep living. Sure,\u201d he concedes, \u201cif someone developed an anti-ageing drug that halted the ageing process, it wouldn\u2019t need wider discussion.\u201d We\u2019d simply live as we do now, with the prospect of life lasting indefinitely, if we remain out of harm\u2019s way. But this isn\u2019t quite Zeleznikow-Johnston\u2019s vision. His is complex, with any potential payoffs in the distant future. Possibly, he\u2019d see us resurrected in unrecognisable forms. \u201cPeople assume we have a crisp, clear idea of what death is,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen that\u2019s not the case: it\u2019s far murkier.\u201d</p> <p>In his book, <em>The Future Loves You</em>, Zeleznikow-Johnston outlines how the demarcation between life and death blurs. \u201cUntil the middle of the 20th century, if you stopped breathing and your heart stopped beating, you were declared dead. No further interventions were available.\u201d Technology changed things. \u201cWe developed mechanical ventilators to keep us breathing; machines to keep blood circulating when the heart stops.\u201d Today, life support devices can act as a fully artificial heart and lungs. \u201cThese advances pushed us toward a definition of death based on brain activity.\u201d</p> <p>In 1968, brain death was introduced into clinical practice: the irreversible cessation of brain functions. Once again, scientific advances now suggest this might be defunct. \u201cWe see that little bits of brain function, like regulation of body temperature or hormone function, can remain, even when most medics would declare someone dead,\u201d he says. Increasingly, medical innovations will allow for certain brain functions to be replicated artificially. \u201cProsthetics are returning blood pressure control to spinal injury patients. After stroke or brain damage, implants can let people talk or use limbs. It\u2019s fairly primitive now, but they\u2019ll improve.\u201d Where, then, do we draw the life/death line?</p>    <p>Increasingly, says Zeleznikow-Johnston, experts are turning to identity. \u201cMaybe a real definition of death,\u201d he says, \u201cis when someone\u2019s personal identity \u2013 their connectome \u2013 is permanently lost.\u201d In layperson\u2019s terms, when our unique consciousness disappears for good. \u201cMost relevant are areas of the brain like the cortex: home to personality and long-term memory.\u201d Much like the total of our genetic makeup is known as our genome, our identity is found in what\u2019s labelled our connectome; the entirety of connections between neurons in our brains. \u201cIt can\u2019t be about the physical stuff in our brain,\u201d he says; the cells which make up our body mass continually renew over the course of a lifetime.</p> <p>Just as it\u2019s the words printed in a book, rather than the specific ink used to form them, that gives its pages meaning, Zeleznikow-Johnston believes the same to be true of you and I. Here lies the heart of Zeleznikow-Johnston\u2019s proposition. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then what can we do <em>now</em> to preserve these identities, when we can\u2019t currently cure someone\u2019s health issue, but might in the future, if only we could buy some time.\u201d</p> <p>With current technology<em><strong>, </strong></em>Zeleznikow-Johnston believes, this is already possible; scientifically straightforward, too. There are the obvious examples where we press pause already: sperm, eggs or embryos can be frozen in stasis for decades before being implanted. \u201cWhat you\u2019re likely less aware of,\u201d he says, \u201care other analogous surgical procedures already in use. Sometimes, during surgery for aneurysms, or damage to blood vessels around the heart, doctors cannot simply route around with bypasses.\u201d Blood flow in these bodies needs halting if an operation has any chance of success. In normal circumstances, this would prove fatal. For decades, however, surgeons have been circumventing death with a technique known as deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s essentially medical hypothermia,\u201d he says. \u201cCool someone\u2019s body down to around 20C, their heart and brain activity and blood circulation will totally stop.\u201d Essentially, the patient looks dead. Procedures can last 30-40 minutes. \u201cThen once re-warmed, miraculously, most of the time patients are restored to consciousness with cognitive function intact.\u201d After 60 minutes in this state, the risk of brain injury increases. \u201cBut it\u2019s a useful precedent: putting people in stasis might be possible if done right, as long as we hold on to those psychological properties inside the connectome.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Up until the 20th century if your heart stopped beating, you were dead</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rudimentary efforts to achieve this started in the mid-1960s: American psychology professor James Bedford, the first human to be frozen; cryonically preserved. To date, roughly 600 people globally have undergone a cryonic procedure. \u201cThere\u2019s good reason to think techniques used in previous decades are just no good,\u201d argues Zeleznikow-Johnston. \u201cTry to straight freeze a human body or brain, ice crystals destroy the tissue. More complicated versions have been tried, the addition of what\u2019s ostensibly antifreeze, but they\u2019ve led to severe dehydration.\u201d Put bluntly, brains shrivel up. \u201cObviously, nobody has demonstrated the reversal of the process, and brain tissue preserved this way doesn\u2019t look good under a microscope.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Now, Zeleznikow-Johnston</strong></em> offers an alternative suggestion: aldehyde-stabilised cryopreservation, also known as fixation. \u201cEssentially,\u201d he says, \u201cby introducing chemicals at the opportune moment which preserve the structure of someone\u2019s brain, we can hold onto its circuitry and structures.\u201d</p> <p>Once frozen, in essence, preserving our identity indefinitely. \u201cIn labs, this process of fixation is used routinely with animal research. Developed in 2015, it\u2019s not a complicated procedure and has been tested on large animals and humans, postmortem.\u201d</p> <p>Two groups on the US west coast, Zeleznikow-Johnston tells me, are on the cusp of offering this to the public. Another in Europe. \u201cIt can certainly be done today,\u201d he\u2019s confident, \u201cand in the next year, it\u2019ll be more accessible. It could be rolled out quickly, if there was demand.\u201d</p> <p>He tots up rough costs in the book\u2019s closing chapters: at today\u2019s prices, roughly $13,000 should pay for the initial preservation procedure. If done at scale, a further $1,300 annually should account for on-going storage and associated admin costs. \u201cI\u2019m not an accountant,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut that\u2019s my best estimate.\u201d Small change compared to the cash required for many medical procedures \u2013 from cancer therapies to transplants.</p> <p>But how we might eventually resurrect remains unclear. What use is pressing pause without a restart button? There, he accepts, we\u2019re firmly into the field of sci-fi. Unfazed, Zeleznikow-Johnston opines that major advances in nanomedicine offer one route; else there\u2019s what\u2019s known as mind-uploading, or mind-emulation \u2013 transferring someone to a digital form. \u201cBreak down the elements and it\u2019s a fairly straightforward extrapolation from today\u2019s technology,\u201d he says. \u201cTake very high resolution scans of brain structure to characterise how someone\u2019s neurons work, recreate it in a digital format then put it in another robotic, virtual or biological body.\u201d Future scientists will need to fill in the details. \u201cYet if the memories and experiences which define us are held on to, a person has survived. A robotic or digital brain, if done right, I\u2019d argue, is still you.\u201d</p> <p>If tomorrow, Zeleznikow-Johnston received a terminal diagnosis, he\u2019d eventually undergo the brain preservation procedure. He\u2019d encourage friends and family to follow. \u201cMy fear of death hasn\u2019t been assuaged,\u201d he says. \u201cIt still scares me. What I\u2019m proposing isn\u2019t magic, even if it comes to fruition.\u201d Countless variables would need to land in our favour: the tech developed and implemented properly. Nuclear war and climate catastrophe avoided. Some future generation opting to offer their distant ancestors another chance at life. \u201cEven with a guarantee of everyone I love returning, I\u2019d still miss them in the short term, but it does provide some comfort. My existential despair that everyone I love will one day disappear hasn\u2019t gone away completely, but it offers a glimmer of hope.\u201d</p> <p>Still unconvinced? Just look, he urges, to anaesthesia. \u201cPrior to the mid-19th century, if you needed an operation, you just had to cope with the pain. Yes, you could take some herbs, alcohol; maybe opiates if they were available.\u201d Alternatives included what was, ostensibly, strangulation, else delivering a knockout blow to the patient\u2019s head. \u201cThis was the case throughout human history, until the discovery of anaesthesia. It was an unprecedented change. No longer did you have to suffer.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s far from consensus on these topics: much is uncharted territory. A newly published survey of 300 neuroscientists found 40% predict brain preservation and restoration will prove possible. Still, Zeleznikow-Johnston is more than prepared to see his entire thesis shot down. \u201cSceptics should put in the effort to scrutinise and critically appraise my proposal,\u201d he says, \u201ceither proving that what I\u2019m advocating for can\u2019t work \u2013 in which case I\u2019ll apologise and abandon it \u2013 or they\u2019ll realise what I\u2019m suggesting has merit. It\u2019s time to establish an academic consensus on the current and near-term feasibility of brain preservation.\u201d One thing, however, is for certain: in an instant, what was once believed impossible can become just another fact of life.</p> <p><em>The Future Loves You: How and Why we Should Abolish Death by Dr Ariel Zeleznikow-Johnston, published by Allen Lane at \u00a325.

Zeleznikow-Johnston, 31, is a research fellow at Melbourne\u2019s Monash University. \u201cI\u2019ve been interested in neuroscience forever,\u201d he says, from his recently acquired, bright, campus office. \u201cIt\u2019s the confluence of biology \u2013 the wet mechanics \u2013 of how cells and neurons work, philosophical questions of identity, and the fun, cognitive mechanics of how the brain functions.\u201d You know that feeling of having a word on the tip of your tongue, but can\u2019t quite get it? \u201cWorking out what\u2019s happening there,\u201d he says, \u201cis basically my day job. Exploring how brains give rise to consciousness.\u201d He\u2019s also interested in the history of medical progress and where the future lies. \u201cLogically, where we can expect this technology to be in 10, 20, 100 years from now. That\u2019s what took me to the prospect of preservation: how we might still be around in decades and centuries to come.\u201d In other words, could we give ourselves a shot at making use of medicine\u2019s far-off advances? \u201cWith the advent of brain preservation,\u201d he writes, \u201cI don\u2019t think that you, or anyone you love, has to die at all.\u201d First, though, a much simpler question: would you even want life eternal? So outlandish is the notion, you\u2019ve likely given it little thought. In his line of work, it\u2019s a topic Zeleznikow-Johnston finds himself grappling with regularly. \u201cReminders that my brain and body are constantly decaying,\u201d he says, \u201ccan become a bit much from time to time; it can feel heightened. And I\u2019ve always been suspicious that our societal acceptance of death comes from an inability to imagine anything otherwise.\u201d It\u2019s a hunch, he says, that\u2019s not purely anecdotal: scientific literature, he mentions, backs him up. \u201cStudies show that if you survey people across all ages,\u201d he says, \u201cand ask how long they\u2019d like to live for, most only ask for five to 10 years longer than their demographic is statistically likely to get: 90, let\u2019s say.\u201d Zeleznikow-Johnston believes this presents an incomplete picture. Research also shows these answers change when it\u2019s stipulated that respondents would be guaranteed good mental and physical health into their later decades. \u201cImmediately the figure jumps: 120 years, 150, longer. And there\u2019s a strong correlation between someone\u2019s age and how long they say they want to live for: the older you get, the further away you want the deadline. When you survey terminally ill people, in hospices and on their deathbed, the vast majority still have a very strong will to live. In most circumstances, I\u2019d argue, people would like to live longer, but feel it\u2019s not possible.\u201d In essence, as our deadline approaches, few people actually want to die. It\u2019s a divergence from much received wisdom. Twentieth-century thinkers like Bernard Williams and Viktor Frankl posited that death gives life meaning. It\u2019s an argument Zeleznikow-Johnston offers short shrift. \u201cSome say we need death because it sets a deadline to achieve goals,\u201d he says, \u201cbut that\u2019s not compelling.\u201d In his book, he rejects, too, suggested environmental and social benefits of dying, too. \u201cIt\u2019s less that there are strong arguments why death is good,\u201d he argues, \u201cbut what I call palliative philosophy: death is inevitable, we want convincing reasons as to why that\u2019s good, so we create them. In fact, we spend vast amounts globally on healthcare and medical research.\u201d It makes up 10% of global economic activity. \u201cModern medicine is really the practice of trying to keep death at bay. But we haven\u2019t yet acknowledged or agreed \u2013 as a society \u2013 that the end goal of medical research is actually to eliminate disease completely.\u201d \u201cIn the early 2000s,\u201d he says, \u201cspecialists were pushing for urgent debates about AI capability and safety. There was no timeline, but they warned of what was coming.\u201d Their pleas weren\u2019t heeded. \u201cFrom 2012, AI exploded. Wider society hadn\u2019t talked about it, and now we\u2019re under-equipped and under-prepared.\u201d Zeleznikow-Johnston suspects a similar revolution in mortality is creeping up on us. Even if you dismiss the rest of what he\u2019s advocating, he says, on the topic of \u201cdefeating death: good or bad?\u201d we ought to make up our minds. Presuming we opt for the former, Zeleznikow-Johnston reckons he might just have a plan. Before grappling with the practicalities of extending our lifespans, consider its foundations, he says. \u201cOnly when we understand what it is to die, can we consider what it means to keep living. Sure,\u201d he concedes, \u201cif someone developed an anti-ageing drug that halted the ageing process, it wouldn\u2019t need wider discussion.\u201d We\u2019d simply live as we do now, with the prospect of life lasting indefinitely, if we remain out of harm\u2019s way. But this isn\u2019t quite Zeleznikow-Johnston\u2019s vision. His is complex, with any potential payoffs in the distant future. Possibly, he\u2019d see us resurrected in unrecognisable forms. \u201cPeople assume we have a crisp, clear idea of what death is,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen that\u2019s not the case: it\u2019s far murkier.\u201d In his book, The Future Loves You, Zeleznikow-Johnston outlines how the demarcation between life and death blurs. \u201cUntil the middle of the 20th century, if you stopped breathing and your heart stopped beating, you were declared dead. No further interventions were available.\u201d Technology changed things. \u201cWe developed mechanical ventilators to keep us breathing; machines to keep blood circulating when the heart stops.\u201d Today, life support devices can act as a fully artificial heart and lungs. \u201cThese advances pushed us toward a definition of death based on brain activity.\u201d In 1968, brain death was introduced into clinical practice: the irreversible cessation of brain functions. Once again, scientific advances now suggest this might be defunct. \u201cWe see that little bits of brain function, like regulation of body temperature or hormone function, can remain, even when most medics would declare someone dead,\u201d he says. Increasingly, medical innovations will allow for certain brain functions to be replicated artificially. \u201cProsthetics are returning blood pressure control to spinal injury patients. After stroke or brain damage, implants can let people talk or use limbs. It\u2019s fairly primitive now, but they\u2019ll improve.\u201d Where, then, do we draw the life/death line? Increasingly, says Zeleznikow-Johnston, experts are turning to identity. \u201cMaybe a real definition of death,\u201d he says, \u201cis when someone\u2019s personal identity \u2013 their connectome \u2013 is permanently lost.\u201d In layperson\u2019s terms, when our unique consciousness disappears for good. \u201cMost relevant are areas of the brain like the cortex: home to personality and long-term memory.\u201d Much like the total of our genetic makeup is known as our genome, our identity is found in what\u2019s labelled our connectome; the entirety of connections between neurons in our brains. \u201cIt can\u2019t be about the physical stuff in our brain,\u201d he says; the cells which make up our body mass continually renew over the course of a lifetime. Just as it\u2019s the words printed in a book, rather than the specific ink used to form them, that gives its pages meaning, Zeleznikow-Johnston believes the same to be true of you and I. Here lies the heart of Zeleznikow-Johnston\u2019s proposition. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then what can we do now to preserve these identities, when we can\u2019t currently cure someone\u2019s health issue, but might in the future, if only we could buy some time.\u201d With current technology, Zeleznikow-Johnston believes, this is already possible; scientifically straightforward, too. There are the obvious examples where we press pause already: sperm, eggs or embryos can be frozen in stasis for decades before being implanted. \u201cWhat you\u2019re likely less aware of,\u201d he says, \u201care other analogous surgical procedures already in use. Sometimes, during surgery for aneurysms, or damage to blood vessels around the heart, doctors cannot simply route around with bypasses.\u201d Blood flow in these bodies needs halting if an operation has any chance of success. In normal circumstances, this would prove fatal. For decades, however, surgeons have been circumventing death with a technique known as deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially medical hypothermia,\u201d he says. \u201cCool someone\u2019s body down to around 20C, their heart and brain activity and blood circulation will totally stop.\u201d Essentially, the patient looks dead. Procedures can last 30-40 minutes. \u201cThen once re-warmed, miraculously, most of the time patients are restored to consciousness with cognitive function intact.\u201d After 60 minutes in this state, the risk of brain injury increases. \u201cBut it\u2019s a useful precedent: putting people in stasis might be possible if done right, as long as we hold on to those psychological properties inside the connectome.\u201d Rudimentary efforts to achieve this started in the mid-1960s: American psychology professor James Bedford, the first human to be frozen; cryonically preserved. To date, roughly 600 people globally have undergone a cryonic procedure. \u201cThere\u2019s good reason to think techniques used in previous decades are just no good,\u201d argues Zeleznikow-Johnston. \u201cTry to straight freeze a human body or brain, ice crystals destroy the tissue. More complicated versions have been tried, the addition of what\u2019s ostensibly antifreeze, but they\u2019ve led to severe dehydration.\u201d Put bluntly, brains shrivel up. \u201cObviously, nobody has demonstrated the reversal of the process, and brain tissue preserved this way doesn\u2019t look good under a microscope.\u201d Now, Zeleznikow-Johnston offers an alternative suggestion: aldehyde-stabilised cryopreservation, also known as fixation. \u201cEssentially,\u201d he says, \u201cby introducing chemicals at the opportune moment which preserve the structure of someone\u2019s brain, we can hold onto its circuitry and structures.\u201d Once frozen, in essence, preserving our identity indefinitely. \u201cIn labs, this process of fixation is used routinely with animal research. Developed in 2015, it\u2019s not a complicated procedure and has been tested on large animals and humans, postmortem.\u201d Two groups on the US west coast, Zeleznikow-Johnston tells me, are on the cusp of offering this to the public. Another in Europe. \u201cIt can certainly be done today,\u201d he\u2019s confident, \u201cand in the next year, it\u2019ll be more accessible. It could be rolled out quickly, if there was demand.\u201d He tots up rough costs in the book\u2019s closing chapters: at today\u2019s prices, roughly $13,000 should pay for the initial preservation procedure. If done at scale, a further $1,300 annually should account for on-going storage and associated admin costs. \u201cI\u2019m not an accountant,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut that\u2019s my best estimate.\u201d Small change compared to the cash required for many medical procedures \u2013 from cancer therapies to transplants. But how we might eventually resurrect remains unclear. What use is pressing pause without a restart button? There, he accepts, we\u2019re firmly into the field of sci-fi. Unfazed, Zeleznikow-Johnston opines that major advances in nanomedicine offer one route; else there\u2019s what\u2019s known as mind-uploading, or mind-emulation \u2013 transferring someone to a digital form. \u201cBreak down the elements and it\u2019s a fairly straightforward extrapolation from today\u2019s technology,\u201d he says. \u201cTake very high resolution scans of brain structure to characterise how someone\u2019s neurons work, recreate it in a digital format then put it in another robotic, virtual or biological body.\u201d Future scientists will need to fill in the details. \u201cYet if the memories and experiences which define us are held on to, a person has survived. A robotic or digital brain, if done right, I\u2019d argue, is still you.\u201d If tomorrow, Zeleznikow-Johnston received a terminal diagnosis, he\u2019d eventually undergo the brain preservation procedure. He\u2019d encourage friends and family to follow. \u201cMy fear of death hasn\u2019t been assuaged,\u201d he says. \u201cIt still scares me. What I\u2019m proposing isn\u2019t magic, even if it comes to fruition.\u201d Countless variables would need to land in our favour: the tech developed and implemented properly. Nuclear war and climate catastrophe avoided. Some future generation opting to offer their distant ancestors another chance at life. \u201cEven with a guarantee of everyone I love returning, I\u2019d still miss them in the short term, but it does provide some comfort. My existential despair that everyone I love will one day disappear hasn\u2019t gone away completely, but it offers a glimmer of hope.\u201d Still unconvinced? Just look, he urges, to anaesthesia. \u201cPrior to the mid-19th century, if you needed an operation, you just had to cope with the pain. Yes, you could take some herbs, alcohol; maybe opiates if they were available.\u201d Alternatives included what was, ostensibly, strangulation, else delivering a knockout blow to the patient\u2019s head. \u201cThis was the case throughout human history, until the discovery of anaesthesia. It was an unprecedented change. No longer did you have to suffer.\u201d There\u2019s far from consensus on these topics: much is uncharted territory. A newly published survey of 300 neuroscientists found 40% predict brain preservation and restoration will prove possible. Still, Zeleznikow-Johnston is more than prepared to see his entire thesis shot down. \u201cSceptics should put in the effort to scrutinise and critically appraise my proposal,\u201d he says, \u201ceither proving that what I\u2019m advocating for can\u2019t work \u2013 in which case I\u2019ll apologise and abandon it \u2013 or they\u2019ll realise what I\u2019m suggesting has merit. It\u2019s time to establish an academic consensus on the current and near-term feasibility of brain preservation.\u201d One thing, however, is for certain: in an instant, what was once believed impossible can become just another fact of life.

The program is one of only two dedicated legal services for sex workers across Australia and Smith is the only lawyer in Victoria who solely represents clients in the industry. She describes her role as that of a \u201cshepherd,\u201d guiding clients through the often overwhelming and complex legal system.

For these clients, she advises filing a complaint with the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission. The VEOHRC commissioner, Ro Allen, told Guardian Australia since new protections for sex workers came into effect in 2022, they have received 26 complaints about the protected attribute \u201cprofession, trade and occupation\u201d connected to sex work. Allen said the four most raised complaints relate to being refused access to rental properties or accommodation, financial or advertising services or employment due to history as a sex worker. \u201cEveryone has the right to be treated fairly and to participate fully in society, regardless of the work they do,\u201d Allen said. \u201cUnfortunately, for people who work in the sex industry, discrimination has been a common experience.\u201d \u2018Police just aren\u2019t interested\u2019 Southside Justice\u2019s work also extends to criminal matters, with Smith helping her clients report sexual assault, stalking, theft and breaches of intervention orders to police.

A spokesperson said police \u201cundertook a range of measures to ensure a smooth transition for the final stage of sex work decriminalisation\u201d, including an introduction of mandatory training for all officiers. \u201cWhile Victoria police\u2019s role in the sex work industry has changed, our obligation and commitment to ensuring community safety remains the same,\u201d they said. Meanwhile, Vixen, a prominent advocacy organisation for sex workers, had its funding halved, and the government\u2019s funding for Southside Justice dried up in June. The Victorian Legal Services Board stepped up to provide $350,000 of further funding to prevent their immediate and imminent closure but the community legal centre is seeking $2.5m from the government over four years to expand the team. In parliament, the Animal Justice party MP Georgie Purcell has taken up Patten\u2019s mantle, advocating for Southside Justice and Vixen to receive more funding. \u201cAs a former stripper, I know all too well the stigma attached to sex work and the discrimination that comes with it too,\u201d she says. \u201cI saw it as an obligation and a duty to continue this vital work.\u201d Purcell says the decriminalisation of sex work followed a \u201cpattern of behaviour\u201d by the government, where it makes \u201cbold, progressive announcement\u201d but fails to follow through. A spokesperson for the Victorian government said it had not cut funding for Southside Justice, describing the grant as \u201cspecific and limited\u201d to help with the transition to decriminalisation. They said the government continued to \u201csupport sex workers through funding for advocacy organisations, as well as developing resources and guidance for the industry\u201d. * Name has been changed",

      "body": "<p>It is one of the most important industrial collections in the world, with more than 175,000 artworks, ceramics and photographs, spanning two centuries of history.</p> <p>The Wedgwood Collection <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/03/wedgwood-collection-saved-nation-3m-public-donations\">was acquired for the nation</a> by the charity Art Fund and gifted to the Victoria and Albert Museum 10 years ago today, and researchers are still uncovering new treasures within it, from china with royal connections to family keepsakes. The fundraising drive to buy the archive is still the most successful ever held by Art Fund.</p> <p>Josiah Wedgwood founded a ceramics company in 1759, which would become one of the largest and most famous manufacturers of Staffordshire pottery. Designs, objects and manuscripts collected by the Wedgwood family cover \u201chistory from the Industrial Revolution to today\u201d, Catrin Jones, chief curator of the V&amp;A Wedgwood Collection, said.</p> <p>Recent discoveries in the collection include dinner plates salvaged from a ship that sank more than 100 years ago off the coast of Norway, Queen Mary\u2019s dolls\u2019 house tea set and a first edition Portland vase bequeathed by Ralph Vaughan Williams, the British composer who died in 1958.</p>    <p>Vaughan Williams was a member of the Wedgwood family, as was the naturalist Charles Darwin. Another treasure from the archive is an Egyptian-style canopic vase \u2013 like those found containing body parts in pharaohs\u2019 tombs \u2013 which was made for Erasmus Darwin, Charles\u2019s grandfather. An exhibition, Wedgwood and Darwin, celebrating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jan/15/ceramics-industry-waterford-wedgwood\">the family\u2019s connection</a>, is planned for February 2025.</p> <p>The Wedgwood Collection has also bought 60 contemporary Wedgwood pieces by modern-day artists for the V&amp;A\u2019s archive to mark the 10th anniversary. This includes the plate set, Harlem Toile de Jouy, by the designer Sheila Bridges which blends the traditional motif with the artist\u2019s own experience as an African American from New York, and a ceramic badge that reimagines Wedgwood\u2019s abolitionist anti-slavery medallion by the graphic designer Amy Sproston.</p> <p>\u201cI think it is particularly important because it\u2019s very complete,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe have the ceramics, the designs, the archive all together \u2013 it also means a lot to people. A lot of people have a Wedgwood connection, whether it\u2019s being interested in collecting or because their granny had a teapot. Everyone recognises the blue and white; it\u2019s iconic.\u201d</p> <p>Wedgwood not only invented new ceramic materials such as jasperware and black basalt but was among the first makers to stamp his name on his product.</p> <p>\u201cHe was the father of modern marketing. We talk about influencers all the time today, but he was a pioneer of that approach \u2013 he placed his objects with well known people, from the time of Queen Charlotte on.\u201d</p> <p>The archive is housed at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/01/wedgwood-museum-industrial-past-collection-history\">Wedgwood\u2019s site in Stoke,</a> where its namesake started his work as a potter in 1759, alongside a working 1940s factory. The company still produces ceramics in the town, known as the world capital of pottery.</p> <p>Jones said: \u201cThe Wedgwood name brings people to the city. I think there\u2019s a narrative of industrial decline and it\u2019s important to recognise the industry employs fewer people than it once did, but there are things to be optimistic about. We can talk about the history and the impact it had and how the individuals in this area shaped the company.\u201d</p>    <p>In the archive are letters from female factory workers employed at Wedgwood during Josiah\u2019s lifetime which describe visiting the Houses of Parliament to fight for abolition and the end of slavery.</p> <p>\u201cHe was very well connected through friendships and business success but while he was engaged with building up wealthy clientele, he had radical ideas and his family were very involved with issues and campaigning. They were on the right side of history, if not on the popular side during their lifetime,\u201d said Jones.</p> <p>The curator said that one of the reasons Wedgwood has endured as a brand is its collaborations with artists and designers.</p> <p>\u201cThey had a great ability to work with top artists and designers in each era. They recognised that good design was the foundation of a successful product.

      "bodyText": "It is one of the most important industrial collections in the world, with more than 175,000 artworks, ceramics and photographs, spanning two centuries of history. The Wedgwood Collection was acquired for the nation by the charity Art Fund and gifted to the Victoria and Albert Museum 10 years ago today, and researchers are still uncovering new treasures within it, from china with royal connections to family keepsakes. The fundraising drive to buy the archive is still the most successful ever held by Art Fund. Josiah Wedgwood founded a ceramics company in 1759, which would become one of the largest and most famous manufacturers of Staffordshire pottery. Designs, objects and manuscripts collected by the Wedgwood family cover \u201chistory from the Industrial Revolution to today\u201d, Catrin Jones, chief curator of the V&amp;A Wedgwood Collection, said. Recent discoveries in the collection include dinner plates salvaged from a ship that sank more than 100 years ago off the coast of Norway, Queen Mary\u2019s dolls\u2019 house tea set and a first edition Portland vase bequeathed by Ralph Vaughan Williams, the British composer who died in 1958. Vaughan Williams was a member of the Wedgwood family, as was the naturalist Charles Darwin. Another treasure from the archive is an Egyptian-style canopic vase \u2013 like those found containing body parts in pharaohs\u2019 tombs \u2013 which was made for Erasmus Darwin, Charles\u2019s grandfather. An exhibition, Wedgwood and Darwin, celebrating the family\u2019s connection, is planned for February 2025. The Wedgwood Collection has also bought 60 contemporary Wedgwood pieces by modern-day artists for the V&amp;A\u2019s archive to mark the 10th anniversary. This includes the plate set, Harlem Toile de Jouy, by the designer Sheila Bridges which blends the traditional motif with the artist\u2019s own experience as an African American from New York, and a ceramic badge that reimagines Wedgwood\u2019s abolitionist anti-slavery medallion by the graphic designer Amy Sproston. \u201cI think it is particularly important because it\u2019s very complete,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe have the ceramics, the designs, the archive all together \u2013 it also means a lot to people. A lot of people have a Wedgwood connection, whether it\u2019s being interested in collecting or because their granny had a teapot. Everyone recognises the blue and white; it\u2019s iconic.\u201d Wedgwood not only invented new ceramic materials such as jasperware and black basalt but was among the first makers to stamp his name on his product. \u201cHe was the father of modern marketing. We talk about influencers all the time today, but he was a pioneer of that approach \u2013 he placed his objects with well known people, from the time of Queen Charlotte on.\u201d The archive is housed at Wedgwood\u2019s site in Stoke, where its namesake started his work as a potter in 1759, alongside a working 1940s factory. The company still produces ceramics in the town, known as the world capital of pottery. Jones said: \u201cThe Wedgwood name brings people to the city. I think there\u2019s a narrative of industrial decline and it\u2019s important to recognise the industry employs fewer people than it once did, but there are things to be optimistic about. We can talk about the history and the impact it had and how the individuals in this area shaped the company.\u201d In the archive are letters from female factory workers employed at Wedgwood during Josiah\u2019s lifetime which describe visiting the Houses of Parliament to fight for abolition and the end of slavery. \u201cHe was very well connected through friendships and business success but while he was engaged with building up wealthy clientele, he had radical ideas and his family were very involved with issues and campaigning. They were on the right side of history, if not on the popular side during their lifetime,\u201d said Jones. The curator said that one of the reasons Wedgwood has endured as a brand is its collaborations with artists and designers. \u201cThey had a great ability to work with top artists and designers in each era. They recognised that good design was the foundation of a successful product. You see that in every period from their work with George Stubbs to Eduardo Paolozzi. \u201cOne of my favourite pieces was bought from Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s estate. It\u2019s art deco, a very glamorous coffee set designed by French designer Paul Follot. It\u2019s a perfect combination of modern design, monochrome and glitzy. It speaks to a collector \u2013 Lagerfeld \u2013 but also to Wedgwood\u2019s amazing ability to produce quality ceramics.\u201d Tristram Hunt, director of the V&amp;A, said: \u201cThe strength of the Wedgwood Collection lies in its inspiration for today\u2019s designers.

      "body": "<p>Nine years ago, Nikki Schultek, an active and healthy woman in her early 30s, experienced a sudden cascade of debilitating and agonising symptoms \u2013 including cognitive and breathing problems and heart arrhythmia \u2013 and was investigated for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/multiple-sclerosis\">multiple sclerosis</a>. But three brain scans and numerous X-rays later, there was still no diagnosis or treatment plan. \u201cIt was like living in a nightmare, imagining not watching my children \u2013 three and five years old \u2013 grow up,\u201d says Schultek.</p> <p>Now, speaking on a video call from North Carolina, she is as bright as a button and shows no signs of degenerative brain disease. It turned out she had multiple chronic infections, including <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> bacteria, which causes Lyme disease and which had stealthily reached her brain. Antibiotics restored her health, but <em>B</em><em> burgdorferi</em> is hard to eradicate once in the brain. She may need maintenance treatment to keep the disease at bay.</p> <p>Schultek is not the only person whose neurological disorder turned out to be caused by microbes in the brain. A <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37283269/\">recent paper she jointly lead-authored</a>, published in Alzheimer\u2019s and Dementia, compiled a long list of case reports where infectious disease was discovered to be the primary cause of dementia, meaning that, in many cases, the dementia was reversible. A few of the patients died, but most survived and saw significant improvements in cognitive function, including a man in his 70s who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease after his swift cognitive decline saw him unable to drive or, eventually, leave the house alone. A sample of his cerebrospinal fluid was taken and revealed a fungal infection caused by <em>Cryptococcus neoformans</em>. Within two years of taking antifungal medication, he was driving again and back at work as a gardener.</p> <p>Richard Lathe, a professor of infectious medicine at the University of Edinburgh and another lead author of the paper, says these patients \u201cwere by accident found to be suffering from various fungal, bacterial or viral infections, and when they treated the patient with antifungals, antivirals or antibiotics, the dementia went away\u201d. He, among others, has been investigating the possibility that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jul/11/unlocking-the-gut-microbiome-and-its-massive-significance-to-our-health\">like the gut</a>, the brain hosts a community of microbes \u2013 an area of largely scientifically uncharted waters, but with huge life-saving potential.</p> <p>A common infection among the dementia cases was what the gardener had: <em>C neoformans</em>, a fungus often found in plants and animals, the spores of which are easily inhaled. The dominant bacterial infection was <em>Borrelia</em>. Only a few viruses were reported, among them herpes simplex and herpes zoster (which&nbsp;causes&nbsp;shingles).</p> <p>Lathe is part of an international group of scientists collaborating on the <a href=\"https://www.alzpi.org/team\">Alzheimer\u2019s Pathobiome Initiative</a>, which is led by Schultek, as executive director and founder. (\u201cPathobiome\u201d refers to the pathogenic \u2013 disease-causing \u2013 microbes and the host\u2019s susceptibility to them.) She has brought together scientists from different fields \u2013 including microbiologists, immunologists, gerontologists and neurologists&nbsp;\u2013 to better understand the role of microbes in the brain, to devise ways to diagnose and treat brain infections that might ordinarily fly under the medical radar, and to identify useful preventive measures, from vaccines to lifestyle factors. First and foremost, though, says Lathe, is establishing what percentage of dementias are caused by infections that could be treated: \u201cWe know there are some. We know it\u2019s unlikely to be 100%, but our guess is that probably half or more could potentially be treated.\u201d</p>    <p>***</p> <p>It used to be widely assumed that the brain was the last bastion of sterility in the human body \u2013 it has a blood-brain barrier, for one, which microbes were thought to be too big to pass through \u2013 but it turns out that microbes flourish in the brain. The brain microbiome is hard to study, though, because we can\u2019t just take a sample as we would for the gut, or&nbsp;swab it like a vagina or a nose.</p> <p>That said, the notion that microbial infection has a role in dementia goes back to Alois Alzheimer who, in 1906, discovered the disease that now bears his name, and Oskar Fischer, who also identified it a year later. Both had suspected that microbes were involved, \u201cbut weren\u2019t able to follow this up\u201d, says Lathe. There is a now a raft of research supporting those early hunches. In Denmark, <a href=\"https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/janet-janbek/publications/\">Janet Janbek</a> \u201chas shown that people with multiple infections are at risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and conversely that people with Alzheimer\u2019s have an increased risk of infections of all kinds\u201d, says Lathe. Other researchers, such as Luis Carrasco in Madrid, have been discovering infections in the brain and nervous system.</p> <p>When Lathe started looking for evidence of microbial life in samples from brains left to medical science, a clearer picture emerged. His paper, <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.06.527297v1\">The Remarkable Complexity of the Brain Microbiome in Health and Disease</a>, looked at brains of people who didn\u2019t have dementia and compared them with Alzheimer\u2019s brains. It found that, while there was a remarkable diversity of species in the control brains, there were often overgrowths of certain bugs in Alzheimer\u2019s brains. In the control brains, microbes differed between brain regions and individuals, hosting mainly fungi, bacteria and chloroplastida (algae-related species). The virus adenovirus type C \u2013 a common culprit for respiratory infections&nbsp;\u2013 was often present, but there weren\u2019t many viruses represented.</p> <p>In many \u2013 but not all \u2013 of the Alzheimer\u2019s brains, says Lathe: \u201cWe saw an overabundance of several microbes&nbsp;\u2013 the major ones are species such as <em>Streptococcus</em> and <em>Staphylococcus</em> in the bacteria, and in the yeasts it\u2019s things like <em>Candida</em> and <em>Cryptococcus</em>, which are all well known to cause diverse pathologies in humans.\u201d There was also a mysterious algae-related species, but it hasn\u2019t been studied much in relation to human health. \u201cIt could be very important, but&nbsp;we don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d</p> <p>This paper was completed in 2023 and submitted to a journal, says Lathe, that wanted independent confirmation of the results before publishing, \u201cwhich is fair enough\u201d. Three research centres in the US have been continuing this line of inquiry. David Corry, a specialist in asthma at Baylor College of Medicine, Texas, has been taking brain samples and plating them directly on agar, says Lathe. \u201cHe\u2019s seen some very interesting microbes coming up. This is just looking at what grows.\u201d Next up is Brian Balin at Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, who \u201chas been arguing that not all the microbes you see in human pathologies will grow in agar\u201d, says Lathe. They need very specialised \u201cmedia\u201d to grow in \u2013 or, even better, human cells. \u201cSo he\u2019s been plating the same brain samples on to human monocytes [a type of white blood cell] in tissue culture, and he sees additional organisms coming up that weren\u2019t previously reported.\u201d Finally, Garth Ehrlich at Drexel University College of Medicine, also in Philadelphia, is using a sophisticated gene amplification method to confirm the identities of microbes in the brain; he is finding <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37780846/\">similar clustering of microbes</a> in samples from Alzheimer\u2019s patients.</p> <p>In the gut, we know that there are good microbes and bad microbes, with a healthy and diverse biome working to keep potential pathogens at bay. \u201cIs&nbsp;the same true in the brain?\u201d asks Lathe. \u201cWe don\u2019t know \u2013 we\u2019ll only find out when we do the analysis in more detail.\u201d (Based on what we know so far, there won\u2019t be the same diversity as in the gut.) But there are still doubters and the notion remains controversial. While it is hard to get any sceptics to go on the record, says Lathe, \u201cif&nbsp;you submit your grant to various places, you get anonymous comments: \u2018I don\u2019t believe it.\u2019 \u2018This is impossible.\u2019 To this day, it\u2019s very, very hard to get funding because of&nbsp;the \u2026 we call them dinosaurs.\u201d</p> <p>While microbes are found in brains of all ages, more pathogens get through at ages when immunity is weaker, such as babies under one and older adults, as the body\u2019s defences weaken and infections and inflammation seep around it more easily. So, is there anything we can do to keep our brain microbiomes healthy?</p>    <p>***</p> <p>The BCG vaccine was originally used against tuberculosis, but it is also often part of a treatment programme for bladder cancer. \u201cIt stimulates the immune system,\u201d says Lathe. A team of researchers in Jerusalem, he says, decided to look at patients who survived bladder cancer and compare dementia prevalence among patients treated with BCG and those who weren\u2019t. \u201cDo they differ in the rate at which they get Alzheimer\u2019s disease?\u201d The answer is yes \u2013 the BCG group appeared to get 75% protection against Alzheimer\u2019s. A number of studies have now found varying levels of protection from BCG, with an average, <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aging-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2023.1243588/full\">according to one&nbsp;meta\u2011analysis</a>, of 45%.</p> <p>A raft of other vaccines have been investigated. This year, says Lathe, \u201cthere was a paper out on shingles \u2013 the zoster vaccine\u201d. This protects against the chickenpox virus, which presents as shingles in adulthood, \u201cwhich is very debilitating, particularly in elderly people, so there is now a [UK] government policy for people in their 70s to receive a zoster vaccine\u201d. In individuals who had that vaccine, there was also a reduction in Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cWe did a complete list of all the vaccines \u2026 diphtheria, hepatitis, zoster, influenza, pneumococcus, typhoid. They all, to a greater or lesser extent, are protective against Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Boost your immune system!\u201d</p> <p>BCG, meanwhile, has been shown to ward off a host of age\u2011related conditions, including skin infections and pneumonias. \u201cOne of the ways in which we would like to take this forward is to recommend routine vaccination of different types of elderly people to prevent not just Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but also&nbsp;age-related&nbsp;morbidities.\u201d</p> <p>Being aware of and treating infections around the body in a timely way could also help \u2013 although at present, says Schultek, it would be rare for a clinician to test for brain infections, even at the onset of cognitive problems. Until new diagnostic tests are developed, they would need to access cerebrospinal fluid, which feeds and cleans the brain, to look for signs of brain infection. This requires a lumbar puncture \u2013 a&nbsp;needle going into the lower back \u2013 and while the procedure is routine in hospitals, it is not without risks and side-effects (such as headaches) and it can take a few days to recover. Of course, if you have Alzheimer\u2019s, the possibility of discovering you have a treatable version would make it worth the risk.</p> <p>If you have recurring herpes infections anywhere on your body, Schultek recommends treating, or preventing recurrence, with antiviral medication such as Aciclovir or Valaciclovir, which are available on the NHS. It may be worth being screened for Lyme disease, too, she says, \u201cif you\u2019re in an endemic area\u201d, because the sooner you treat it, the better.</p> <p>Good hygiene, such as hand-washing, may do more than stop you catching a cold or the flu. A&nbsp;newly published <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/230/Supplement_2/S150/7754701?login=false\">paper by members of the Alzheimer\u2019s Pathobiome Initiative</a> explores how \u201cmicrobes invade the sensory systems of the head and neck to exploit the brain\u201d, says Schultek. \u201cThis pertains to viruses and bacteria that can enter through the nose, like Covid, as well as microbes that enter via the mouth, eyes and ears.\u201d These senses often become defective as Alzheimer\u2019s develops, \u201cand the evidence suggests part of this might be due to these infections impacting our ability to smell, but then also impacting the brain itself\u201d. </p> <p>The nose is an increasingly well\u2011established route for microbes to reach the brain. \u201cA research team at Griffith University in Australia found that you could infect mice with <em>Chlamydia pneumoniae</em>, which can cause pneumonia or a cold, and you could cause the mice to develop an Alzheimer\u2019s-like pathology in the brain,\u201d says Schultek. \u201cAnd this is not the only group that has shown it. Dr Balin was the first one to show this and demonstrate that this organism is able to get through the nose and enter the brain.\u201d This triggered a flurry of media reports that avoiding picking one\u2019s nose could help lower dementia risk.

      "bodyText": "Nine years ago, Nikki Schultek, an active and healthy woman in her early 30s, experienced a sudden cascade of debilitating and agonising symptoms \u2013 including cognitive and breathing problems and heart arrhythmia \u2013 and was investigated for multiple sclerosis. But three brain scans and numerous X-rays later, there was still no diagnosis or treatment plan. \u201cIt was like living in a nightmare, imagining not watching my children \u2013 three and five years old \u2013 grow up,\u201d says Schultek. Now, speaking on a video call from North Carolina, she is as bright as a button and shows no signs of degenerative brain disease. It turned out she had multiple chronic infections, including Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria, which causes Lyme disease and which had stealthily reached her brain. Antibiotics restored her health, but B burgdorferi is hard to eradicate once in the brain. She may need maintenance treatment to keep the disease at bay. Schultek is not the only person whose neurological disorder turned out to be caused by microbes in the brain. A recent paper she jointly lead-authored, published in Alzheimer\u2019s and Dementia, compiled a long list of case reports where infectious disease was discovered to be the primary cause of dementia, meaning that, in many cases, the dementia was reversible. A few of the patients died, but most survived and saw significant improvements in cognitive function, including a man in his 70s who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease after his swift cognitive decline saw him unable to drive or, eventually, leave the house alone. A sample of his cerebrospinal fluid was taken and revealed a fungal infection caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. Within two years of taking antifungal medication, he was driving again and back at work as a gardener. Richard Lathe, a professor of infectious medicine at the University of Edinburgh and another lead author of the paper, says these patients \u201cwere by accident found to be suffering from various fungal, bacterial or viral infections, and when they treated the patient with antifungals, antivirals or antibiotics, the dementia went away\u201d. He, among others, has been investigating the possibility that, like the gut, the brain hosts a community of microbes \u2013 an area of largely scientifically uncharted waters, but with huge life-saving potential. A common infection among the dementia cases was what the gardener had: C neoformans, a fungus often found in plants and animals, the spores of which are easily inhaled. The dominant bacterial infection was Borrelia. Only a few viruses were reported, among them herpes simplex and herpes zoster (which causes shingles). Lathe is part of an international group of scientists collaborating on the Alzheimer\u2019s Pathobiome Initiative, which is led by Schultek, as executive director and founder. (\u201cPathobiome\u201d refers to the pathogenic \u2013 disease-causing \u2013 microbes and the host\u2019s susceptibility to them.) She has brought together scientists from different fields \u2013 including microbiologists, immunologists, gerontologists and neurologists \u2013 to better understand the role of microbes in the brain, to devise ways to diagnose and treat brain infections that might ordinarily fly under the medical radar, and to identify useful preventive measures, from vaccines to lifestyle factors. First and foremost, though, says Lathe, is establishing what percentage of dementias are caused by infections that could be treated: \u201cWe know there are some. We know it\u2019s unlikely to be 100%, but our guess is that probably half or more could potentially be treated.\u201d *** It used to be widely assumed that the brain was the last bastion of sterility in the human body \u2013 it has a blood-brain barrier, for one, which microbes were thought to be too big to pass through \u2013 but it turns out that microbes flourish in the brain. The brain microbiome is hard to study, though, because we can\u2019t just take a sample as we would for the gut, or swab it like a vagina or a nose. That said, the notion that microbial infection has a role in dementia goes back to Alois Alzheimer who, in 1906, discovered the disease that now bears his name, and Oskar Fischer, who also identified it a year later. Both had suspected that microbes were involved, \u201cbut weren\u2019t able to follow this up\u201d, says Lathe. There is a now a raft of research supporting those early hunches.

The home value index compiled by the data group CoreLogic showed housing prices rose by a modest 0.1% in November \u2013 its weakest Australia-wide result since January 2023. Last month the national median house price was $812,933. It was $1,196,809 in Sydney, $776,949 in Melbourne, $886,540 in Brisbane and $813,716 in Adelaide. November could be the last month of growth in this \u201ccycle\u201d, according to CoreLogic\u2019s research director, Tim Lawless. \u201cThe mid-sized capitals and most of the regional \u2026 markets continue to provide some support for growth in the national index,\u201d Lawless said. \u201cBut it is clear momentum is also leaving these markets.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Lawless said the downturn was gathering speed in Melbourne and Sydney and the market in the mid-sized capitals \u2013 which have experienced the highest growth \u2013 was also slowing down. Rents increased in every capital city in November, with the national rental index rising by 0.2%. CoreLogic considers rental market to be experiencing a \u201crelatively flat run of growth\u201d, even though rents are still rising at more than twice the pre-pandemic decade average of 2%. Overall, the Australia-wide price of rental properties has increased by 5.3% over the past 12 months. A year ago rents were increasing at the annual rate of 8.1%, according to the CoreLogic report. \u201cIt will be interesting to see if the rate of rental growth rebounds through the seasonally strong first quarter of the year in 2025,\u201d Lawless said. \u201cBut beyond any seasonality, it looks increasingly like the rental boom is over.\u201d House prices fell in Melbourne, Darwin, Sydney and Canberra in November, with the Victorian capital experiencing the biggest drop at -0.4%. House prices have decreased in Melbourne in over 10 of the past 12 months, according to CoreLogic, falling by 2.3% overall. House prices fell in Sydney for a second month in a row in November, dropping by 0.2%, which followed a 0.1% decrease in October. CoreLogic said September was likely the peak of its growth cycle. There were also more houses for sale in Sydney and Melbourne than there had been at this time of year since 2018. Compared with the previous five-year average, property listings were 10.4% higher in Sydney and 9.1% higher in Melbourne. Perth\u2019s housing marked continued to lead the nation, Corelogic said, with prices up 1.1% in November and rising by 3.0% over the spring quarter. But this was the smallest increase over a three-month period since April 2023 and less than half the 6.7% rate of growth the Western Australian capital recorded over the June quarter. Outside the capital cities, Corelogic\u2019s report said regional housing trends had been \u201ca little stronger\u201d. The combined regional housing index rose by 1.1% over the past three months compared with a 0.3% lift across the combined capitals. As with the capital cities, the results in regional Australia were mixed. While housing prices in regional Victoria fell by 0.9% over the past three months, they increased in every other state.

Mike Jones, by email Send new questions to nq@theguardian.com. Readers reply I have a dim recollection that buried somewhere in Orwell\u2019s correspondence is his answer to the same question, asked of him some time after that essay on the perfect pub appeared \u2013 his answer being that he had made up the name, wanting something he had never heard any actual pub being called and hoping to avoid people trying to work out which one he was describing (in days when there were still pubs on every other street corner). Eventually, nature imitated art. The great man would probably be quite amused by that. Petronius In the National Portrait Gallery, there is a portrait of Sir Walter Raleigh by an unknown artist.

      "body": "<p>It was the turn of the 1970s when Brett and Wendy Whiteley moved into what was then a \u201cvery old, run-down house\u201d overlooking Sydney Harbour. The couple had spent most of the previous decade living between the bright lights of London\u2019s Ladbroke Grove and New York\u2019s Chelsea hotel, together with their young daughter, Arkie.</p> <p>Returning to comparatively sleepy Sydney might have felt like a step down \u2013 but Wendy Whiteley loved their Lavender Bay home so much that it didn\u2019t matter. Many of Brett\u2019s most famous paintings were produced from its balcony, which offers a prime view of the harbour. The family lived there until the late 1980s, when the couple divorced. They had both battled heroin addiction but, while Wendy managed to get clean, Brett died from an overdose in 1992. Arkie died from cancer in 2001. In her grief, Whiteley spent years and millions of dollars converting the derelict RailCorp-owned land adjacent to their home into a charming secret garden \u2013 one now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/09/wendy-whiteleys-secret-garden-is-safe-for-decades-to-come\">protected by a long-term council lease</a>.</p> <p>In our conversation, Whiteley reported feeling amazed to still be here at 83. She is matter of fact when discussing bereavement and addiction, as she\u2019s now very used to talking about the hard things. She considers the 1960s the best time of her life, largely due to the front-row seat she had to the decade\u2019s cultural revolution. And she still lives in that Lavender Bay home, which, like the garden, she has lovingly transformed over the years into something beautiful. You can hear the roar of children screaming at Luna Park from her living room but it\u2019s noise she doesn\u2019t mind, because it\u2019s a happy sound.</p> <p>Here Whiteley tells us about the most cherished and most useful items in a home rich with history \u2013 both the personal and the culturally significant.</p> <h2>What I\u2019d save from my house in a fire</h2>    <p>There\u2019s a lot of things but what I would really hate to lose is a mouse hand puppet that Arkie and I made together when she was in kindergarten, just after we first got back to live in Sydney.</p> <p>We had to make something for the school, so we made this and it just turned out so well. We made the face out of papier-mache. I made a lovely little corduroy frock with some red buttons for it to wear. I think Brett did a little bit of pinching on the mouse\u2019s face. And we mounted it on a metal stand, so it\u2019s like a sculpture. It now sits on my sculpture shelf next to a Balinese puppet.</p> <p>I\u2019ve come to realise that I\u2019m incredibly attached to it, particularly because it was made for Arkie and we all made it together. My daughter died, and Brett died too. So it\u2019s a real emotional connection [to] her being very much alive and young and the beginning of a life, rather than the end of her life. It\u2019s a memory of a very happy time \u2013 she was so excited to take it to school.</p> <h2>My most useful object</h2> <p>A well-seasoned cast iron fry-pan \u2013 the old-fashioned kind, when they used to come from Spain.</p> <p>I\u2019ve bought plenty of new non-stick fry-pans but this one, which must be 50 years old at least, is still my favourite. This thing\u2019s so beautifully seasoned, and so nice to look at. Add a little bit of oil and you can fry the best egg in there. Fried eggs are the best thing to have in the morning. Scrambled is second.</p> <p>And it holds a lot of memories, that fry-pan. Arkie used it, we all used it, it was everybody\u2019s favourite cooking thing. I got it when we first moved into Lavender Bay and it\u2019s still here \u2013 like me.</p> <h2>The item I most regret losing</h2> <p>There are two pieces of jewellery, both made for me or given for a special occasion, that I lost. The first was a necklace that <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/culture/art-and-design/jeweller-to-the-stars-tony-white-s-personal-collection-set-for-auction-20201008-p5638h.html\">Tony White</a> made for me, which I lost somewhere in a nightclub in London. That one was really all my fault. It was a rasta nightclub in the back of Portobello Road and it was very wild \u2013 everybody was drinking and smoking a lot of hashish.</p>    <p>I also had a Georgian gold brooch that [Brett\u2019s mother] Beryl Whiteley gave me as something to wear for when Brett and I got married in New York. It just fell off somewhere a few weeks later, which Brett was furious about and I was upset about too. Beryl was very upset that I\u2019d lost it, because she thought that meant I didn\u2019t care enough about the brooch.</p> <p>I hate the wedding photographs of Brett and me but the brooch looks very nice. We were trying to keep everybody happy about the way we looked. Brett had his hair cut and he bought a suit, which he wore that day and never again. A good friend of mine made the wedding frock and I just hated it. It doesn\u2019t look like us at all.

Fibre-optic filaments whisk emails, Netflix and military secrets through deep water, where the cord \u2013 about as thick as a garden hose \u2013 gathers barnacles and seaweed. Australia is connected to 15 of them (that we know of), with the main landing stations in Sydney and Perth. They are buried under the beach, then fed out into the open water at depths of up to 8km before re-emerging in landing stations in Singapore, Oman and Hawaii, among others. And they\u2019re vulnerable to sabotage and accidents, to hacking and (very occasionally) sharks. Last month two cables in the Baltic Sea \u2013 one connecting Finland and Germany, the other connecting Sweden and Lithuania \u2013 were damaged in a suspected sabotage attack. They were damaged at about the same time a Chinese-registered ship passed over them. On Thursday the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, said the Baltic Sea was now a \u201chigh-risk\u201d zone. And experts say Australia\u2019s own cables are not immune from threats. Despite the blustering promises of satellite technology, and despite the difficulty of building infrastructure thousands of metres beneath the surface, these cables still carry 99% of Australia\u2019s data. They can carry up to 300 terabits of data a second, making their capacity \u201cvirtually limitless\u201d. The maritime security expert Sam Bashfield is a research fellow at the University of Melbourne\u2019s Australia India Institute.

There are between 100 and 200 breaks a year but only a limited number of ships that can fix them. When two of the three cables connecting Tasmania to the mainland were accidentally cut on the same day in March 2022, it gave an idea of the disruption that occur. Tonga, which has only one cable connecting it to the rest of the world, spent weeks without the internet this year. Last week Google Cloud revealed its Australia Connect project. New cables will connect Australia with Christmas Island and Fiji, where other connections go on to Singapore and the US. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said the new systems would \u201cexpand and strengthen the resilience of Australia\u2019s own digital connectivity\u201d and \u201csupport secure, resilient and reliable connectivity across the Pacific\u201d. Australia has also announced it will spend $18m over four years on a cable connectivity and resilience centre to strengthen engagement in the region \u2013 a move broadly seen as part of the Quad\u2019s efforts to limit China\u2019s influence. But it doesn\u2019t own the cables \u2013 they\u2019re owned by telecommunications companies and increasingly the \u201chyperscalers\u201d, including Amazon, Meta and Google.

They also occur up the east coasts of South America and South Africa, as well as New Zealand\u2019s South Island, but are referred to by different terms elsewhere, Speer says. \u201cThe topography plays a similar part [there]\u201d. How is global heating changing southerly busters? In research published this year, Speer and his colleagues found that global heating had increased the frequency of southerly busters over the last three decades. Analysing data from 1970 to 2023, they found that before 1995, the busters that occurred were mostly severe \u2013 defined by wind gusts greater than 74km/h. From 1996 onwards, the number of less severe busters began to increase, shooting up dramatically between 2017 and 2022. \u201cWhile those severe ones haven\u2019t decreased, there have just always been very few of them,\u201d Speer says. \u201cYou\u2019ll see typically one to two per year before the 1990s, and from 1990s the weaker ones gradually pick up.\u201d There was a huge increase in the frequency of weaker southerly busters over the triple La Ni\u00f1a years of 2020 to 2022, he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s just that people didn\u2019t notice them.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple in October and November and one came through overnight and I didn\u2019t notice any gusts at all.\u201d While southerly busters can provide cool relief after a heatwave, Speer and his colleagues warn that their increasing frequency may make it more dangerous for planes taking off and landing, for people swimming and in boats, and could elevate bushfire danger and also the chances of wind damage to coastal property. Is increasingly extreme weather making predictions harder? Extreme weather including heatwaves and flash flooding are increasing in frequency globally. These extreme events are considered rare and severe in the context of a region\u2019s \u201ctypical\u201d climate. Meteorologists usually define a region\u2019s climate using a 30-year average of mainly rainfall and temperature data. But Speer suggests that extreme short-term climate variations are making these 30-year averages less useful as a baseline comparison of what is normal. New research he co-authored, published in the journal Academia Environmental Sciences and Sustainability, suggests that scientists need to update their climate models to provide more accurate seasonal and annual rainfall and temperature forecasts. Because extreme variations are now occurring in periods of a decade or shorter, big changes can inadvertently be hidden in averages over longer periods. \u201cThe averages of extreme events \u2013 [for example] no rain versus a hell of a lot of rain \u2013 they can cancel out over 30 years,\u201d Speer says. The study\u2019s authors suggest that different regions may need to come up with their own shorter climate time periods to more accurately forecast extreme weather events in future.",

The best-of-14-games match is scheduled to take place from 23 November to 15 December at Resorts World Sentosa in Singapore for an overall prize fund of $2.5m (\u00a31.98m).</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Ding became China's first men\u2019s world chess champion by defeating Ian Nepomniachtchi last year in Kazakhstan, winning the title vacated by longtime world No 1 Magnus Carlsen of Norway. But the 32-year-old from Zhejiang province has played only 44 classical games in the 19 months since winning the world title while battling personal difficulties including depression and will go off as an underdog in his first world title defense.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Gukesh, commonly known as Gukesh D, stunned the chess establishment by winning the eight-man Candidates tournament in Toronto aged 17 to become the youngest ever challenger for the world championship, finishing top of a stacked field that included Nepomniachtchi, Hikaru Nakamura and Fabiano Caruana. The 18-year-old can shatter the record for youngest ever world champion held by Garry Kasparov, who was 22 when he dethroned Karpov in their 1985 rematch in Moscow.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>The format</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The match will consist of 14 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw. Whoever reaches seven and a half points first will be declared the champion.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The time control for each game in the classical portion is 120 minutes per side for the first 40 moves, then 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with a 30-second increment per move starting with move 41.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If the score is equal after 14 games, tiebreak games with faster time controls will be played:</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;A match consisting of four rapid games with 15 minutes per side and a 10-second increment starting with move 1 would be played. If a player scores 2\u00bd points or more, he would win the championship.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;If the score is still equal, a mini-match of two rapid games would be played, with 10 minutes per side and a five-second increment starting with move 1. If a player scored 1\u00bd points or more, he would win the championship.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;If the score is equal after the rapid portion, a mini-match of two blitz games would be played, with a time control of three minutes per side and a two-second increment starting with move 1. If a player scored 1\u00bd points or more, he would win the championship. A drawing of lots would take place before each mini-match to decide which player plays with the white pieces.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;If the blitz mini-match are tied, a single blitz game with a time control of three minutes per side and a two-second increment starting with move 1 would be played, and the winner would win the championship. A drawing of lots would decide which player plays with the white pieces. If this game was drawn, another blitz game with reversed colors would be played with the same time control, and the winner would win the championship. This process is repeated until either player wins a game.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Players are not allowed to agree to a draw before black's 40th move.

The 18-year-old declined a draw offer by refusing a threefold repetition with 26...Qh4!?, instead of taking a draw by repetition with Qe7!, drawing audible gasps from the gallery assembled outside the sound-proof playing hall. \u201cI just thought I always have counterplay and I saw no reason to take [a draw] now,\u201d Gukesh said. \u201cI wanted to make a few more moves and see what happens.\u201d But with time pressure mounting for both players ahead of the first time control, Ding seemingly gave up his advantage with a queen exchange (34.Qc2!?). The position simplified into a rook endgame, with neither player able to find a breakthrough before the game concluded with a series of repetitions after 4hr 15min. Ding entered the first defense of his world championship a week ago having gone 28 classical games without a win, a wretched run of form that saw him drop to 23rd in the world rankings and prompted the oddsmakers to install him as roughly a 3-1 longshot in the match. But he sprang a major surprise in Monday\u2019s first game by winning as black, dramatically ending the 304-day winless streak. Game 2 on Tuesday was a tame 23-move draw, before Gukesh struck back on Wednesday with a win in Game 3. The fourth and fifth games were each calm draws. The fifth-ranked Gukesh, already the youngest ever world title challenger in the competition\u2019s 138-year history, can shatter the record for youngest ever undisputed world champion held by Garry Kasparov, who was 22 when he dethroned Anatoly Karpov in their 1985 rematch in Moscow. \u201cSo far it\u2019s been good,\u201d Gukesh said when asked to assess his performance so far. \u201cObviously I still can improve my play. There are a lot more gamews to try and do that. It\u2019s an equal match so far. Considering that I was also trailing after the first game, I\u2019m happy to be here. But it\u2019s too early to think about anything like that. We are not even halfway through the event.\u201d The overall score in their $2.5m showdown at Resorts World Sentosa is 3-3 ahead of Monday\u2019s rest day. Whoever reaches seven and a half points first will be declared the champion in the scheduled three-week contest at the Equarius Hotel at the Resorts World Sentosa, an island resort off Singapore\u2019s southern coast.",

The hillier parts of Scotland are braced for the coldest weather, although forecasters expect widespread sub-zero conditions in rural areas on Monday and Tuesday.

The cold snap is expected to cause some travel disruption on higher ground, with ice, frost and fog forecast for the first half of this week, meteorologists said.

The prospect of Trump\u2019s second administration is devastating for many American women, but its reverberations are also echoing for women across the globe, and bringing much more fear and uncertainty than last time around.</p> <p>Eight years ago, while Trump\u2019s success shocked women in Britain, it also brought rays of hope \u2013 in the shape of a resurgence of solidarity. On the day after the election in 2016, I remember going into my workplace, a <a href=\"https://www.refugeewomen.co.uk/\">charity for refugee women</a>, feeling pretty bleak, and looking at other women\u2019s downcast faces. Then, at the end of the day, one of our colleagues had the most unexpected news. The charity\u2019s online donations had rocketed.</p> <p>Looking at the list of donations, many accompanied by messages of support, my heart rose. I realised that so many women, waking up to that bitter news, had chosen not despair but determined support for those Trump hated most \u2013 women and migrants \u2013 and had backed up that empathy with action.</p> <p>A few months later, that rise of solidarity took its most colourful and energising form. The Women\u2019s Marches didn\u2019t just take place in Washington and cities across the US, they took place on every continent. Even women in Antarctica organised a rally on an expedition ship. I saw them as part of a gathering wave of women\u2019s protests. Through the Green Wave in Latin America and other protests against violence and for reproductive rights everywhere from Poland to South Korea, India to Ireland, so many women\u2019s movements were becoming more visible. The Women\u2019s Marches were a kind of icing on the cake, so bright, so lovely \u2013 but also fragile, and soon to show cracks.</p> <p>There are protests planned in Washington for Trump\u2019s second inauguration, but they are likely to be more muted, and they are unlikely be accompanied by pink-hatted crowds flowing through cities across the world. Why?</p>    <p>Some of the cracks that make solidarity so elusive this time were around starting to be apparent back then. The famous image of activist Angela Peoples holding the \u201cWhite women voted for Trump\u201d sign on the 2017 Washington march is being shared again. And her point is more urgent now. Yet again, a majority of white women chose to put a sexual abuser in the White House and to undermine other women\u2019s reproductive rights.</p> <p>As one black woman said so pertinently on social media in response to the suggestion of another women\u2019s march: \u201cWhite women should have marched yourselves down to the polls to vote against Trump.\u201d </p> <p>And other rifts that started to open then have also gaped ever more widely since. In Britain, arguments quickly erupted in 2017 over whether the Women\u2019s March was either <a href=\"https://thebeaverlse.co.uk/lse-societies-fail-organise-womens-march/\">too exclusive of trans women</a> \u2013 since those pink hats might be \u201cexcluding trans women\u201d \u2013 or, on the contrary, <a href=\"https://www.mumsnet.com/talk/womens_rights/3483242-Womens-March-London-says-trans-voices-should-be-elevated-over-womens-voices\">too eager to centre them</a>. Since then, winning arguments on gender identity seems to be more important to some feminists than finding common ground.</p> <p>As the backlash gathers pace, not only in the US, international feminist solidarity has weakened on other fronts too. In the past, there was a bland hope in many international organisations that liberal feminism could be promoted everywhere with the backing of US power and money. That vision became more and more fragile, but it really fell apart when the US withdrew from Afghanistan in summer 2021 and Afghan women, once blithely promised support and protection, were forced back into their homes and brutally punished for speaking out.</p> <p>And it became even harder to hold on to the rhetoric of global women\u2019s solidarity once western women became helpless witnesses to the conflict in Gaza. While <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/usa-israel-has-used-us-made-arms-gaza-violation-international-law-new-report\">US-made bombs</a> fall on women and children, it\u2019s hard to imagine marching for American women\u2019s freedoms.</p> <p>In these dark times, maybe it sounds mad to say that I\u2019m not giving up on women\u2019s solidarity. But to me, as to so many women, solidarity isn\u2019t an idea, it\u2019s a practice; it\u2019s not a performance, it\u2019s work \u2013 hard work. Recently, I\u2019ve been speaking to women across the globe \u2013 from Northern Ireland to Canada, from Iran to Peru \u2013 and over and over again I hear how they continue their feminist work, which may not involve so much marching and singing now, but is just as fierce and dogged as it ever was.</p> <p>Every day, a woman needs an abortion, needs a refuge, needs a lawyer, needs food, needs shelter, and, every day, women are stepping up for one another, feeding, caring, building, healing, planting.</p> <p>This very material sense of a common struggle, based on shared experiences of marginalisation and disempowerment, has not disappeared. On the contrary, as the populist right rises, it becomes more entrenched where it matters, not so much on platforms and podiums as on the frontline of survival.</p> <p>So as I listen to these women, as their stories flow towards and through me, I recognise that there at the roots a deep solidarity keeps growing in the dark, and I have faith that one day I\u2019ll see it flowering again.</p> <p><em>Natasha Walter is the author of Before the Light Fades: A Family Story of Resistance, and the founder of Women for Refugee Women</em></p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

There are protests planned in Washington for Trump\u2019s second inauguration, but they are likely to be more muted, and they are unlikely be accompanied by pink-hatted crowds flowing through cities across the world. Why? Some of the cracks that make solidarity so elusive this time were around starting to be apparent back then. The famous image of activist Angela Peoples holding the \u201cWhite women voted for Trump\u201d sign on the 2017 Washington march is being shared again. And her point is more urgent now. Yet again, a majority of white women chose to put a sexual abuser in the White House and to undermine other women\u2019s reproductive rights. As one black woman said so pertinently on social media in response to the suggestion of another women\u2019s march: \u201cWhite women should have marched yourselves down to the polls to vote against Trump.\u201d And other rifts that started to open then have also gaped ever more widely since. In Britain, arguments quickly erupted in 2017 over whether the Women\u2019s March was either too exclusive of trans women \u2013 since those pink hats might be \u201cexcluding trans women\u201d \u2013 or, on the contrary, too eager to centre them. Since then, winning arguments on gender identity seems to be more important to some feminists than finding common ground. As the backlash gathers pace, not only in the US, international feminist solidarity has weakened on other fronts too. In the past, there was a bland hope in many international organisations that liberal feminism could be promoted everywhere with the backing of US power and money. That vision became more and more fragile, but it really fell apart when the US withdrew from Afghanistan in summer 2021 and Afghan women, once blithely promised support and protection, were forced back into their homes and brutally punished for speaking out. And it became even harder to hold on to the rhetoric of global women\u2019s solidarity once western women became helpless witnesses to the conflict in Gaza. While US-made bombs fall on women and children, it\u2019s hard to imagine marching for American women\u2019s freedoms. In these dark times, maybe it sounds mad to say that I\u2019m not giving up on women\u2019s solidarity. But to me, as to so many women, solidarity isn\u2019t an idea, it\u2019s a practice; it\u2019s not a performance, it\u2019s work \u2013 hard work. Recently, I\u2019ve been speaking to women across the globe \u2013 from Northern Ireland to Canada, from Iran to Peru \u2013 and over and over again I hear how they continue their feminist work, which may not involve so much marching and singing now, but is just as fierce and dogged as it ever was. Every day, a woman needs an abortion, needs a refuge, needs a lawyer, needs food, needs shelter, and, every day, women are stepping up for one another, feeding, caring, building, healing, planting. This very material sense of a common struggle, based on shared experiences of marginalisation and disempowerment, has not disappeared. On the contrary, as the populist right rises, it becomes more entrenched where it matters, not so much on platforms and podiums as on the frontline of survival. So as I listen to these women, as their stories flow towards and through me, I recognise that there at the roots a deep solidarity keeps growing in the dark, and I have faith that one day I\u2019ll see it flowering again.

      "body": "<p>My boyfriend\u2019s parents coached youth sports teams in the 90s, so they have many anecdotes about how children handle winning and losing. Two cousins on separate soccer teams were so competitive that the one who lost would refuse the post-game high-five, instead retreating to some nearby bushes to cry. A little girl used to kick opponents with her ice skates during hockey; another refused to pass because her dad gave her cash for every goal she scored. One boy, when his team lost, lay flat out on the ice and simply wouldn\u2019t get up.</p> <p>There\u2019s a general consensus that, in addition to boosting fitness, youth sports impart valuable life skills, like teamwork and discipline. Winning and losing are especially significant, because they prepare children for the setbacks and challenges they will face in adult life.</p> <p>Expert opinion on the topic is not uniform, but many agree with that general logic. \u201cWinning and losing experiences are crucial,\u201d says Dr Billy Garvey, a developmental and behavioral pediatrician and author of Ten Things I Wish You Knew about Your Child\u2019s Mental Health<em>. </em>For children, especially those aged five to 12, learning to navigate the ups and downs of competition is a stepping stone to stable self-esteem and resilience, he tells me.</p> <p>Garvey has a three-year-old daughter who, he tells me, is particularly competitive. \u201cWhen she loses, I ensure that I connect with her, validate her frustration, anger or feeling that it\u2019s unfair,\u201d he says. Once she\u2019s calmer, he adds, \u201cI can help her learn the lesson in losing, by saying something like: \u2018See how happy your little brother Charlie is that he won? I bet that feels nice for him.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDisappointment should always be complemented with unconditional love and support,\u201d says Garvey. When kids are supported through losing, they benefit psychologically from the understanding that their worth is not tied to their performance, and that their effort and growth matter more than winning, he says. Meanwhile, winning can be a \u201cgenuine opportunity to take pride in themselves when that effort has been successful\u201d.</p> <p>Jordan Lund has three children under age eight and coaches youth hockey, baseball and soccer in Squamish, British Columbia, in Canada. He agrees that kids need to experience competition, though a gentle approach is key. \u201cKids like to be challenged,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have a fire and spirit in them to root for their teammates\u2019 success and to accomplish things themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Lund\u2019s teams don\u2019t use scoring or standings yet, but he believes it\u2019s important for kids to learn about winning and losing, provided coaches create a psychologically safe environment. That means no yelling at kids to \u201clook alive\u201d or embarrassing those who fumble a play. \u201cSome of the coaches we had in the 80s were not so conscious of that,\u201d Lund remembers.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Yet the environment of youth sports can often be shaped by a different set of values \u2013 one that prioritizes performance and victory above all else. Some experts argue that, in recent decades, youth sports, once a space for fun and personal development, have become increasingly high-stakes arenas where children are treated like miniature professional athletes.</p> <p>\u201cSport as a whole is becoming more competitive,\u201d says Jaclyn Ellis, a Chicago-based mental-performance coach who works with athletes in their pre-teens and older. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming harder for athletes to accept failure because the pressure to perform is so intense, even at young ages.\u201d Ellis observes this in junior leagues, too, where parents of children who express early interest or skill at a certain sport may route their child toward a path of specialization and intense training, hoping it will lead to scholarships and a career.</p> <p>Ellis says over-ascribing to the win/lose binary is \u201ccalled \u2018all-or-none thinking\u2019\u201d, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very black-or-white, but most of the time, performance is not just good or bad \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of grey area.\u201d</p> <p>Rigid thinking can make losing a threat to a player\u2019s sense of self, and also render winning joyless. Ellis described one 14-year-old soccer player\u2019s body language after a successful play. \u201cShe scored a goal and walked back, shoulders drooping, and her coach was like: \u2018What, no celebration?\u2019 and she just said: \u2018Well, it\u2019s my job to score a goal. Why should I celebrate that?\u2019\u201d Ellis recounts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/\" data-alt=\"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, \u2018Well Actually\u2019, then \u2018Read more on living a good life in a complex world,\u2019 then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say \u2018More from this section\u2019\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>For perfectionists, this mindset can make them reluctant to even try unless they\u2019re sure they can succeed flawlessly. \u201cWhat is that teaching us?\u201d Ellis asks. \u201cWe\u2019re not willing to get out of our comfort zone, not even willing to try.\u201d</p> <p>Ellis uses cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques to help young athletes see that their worth isn\u2019t tied to perfect outcomes. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to rewire the brain to understand that \u2018all or none\u2019 thinking is hurtful to your mind and performance,\u201d she says. Instead, she encourages young athletes to embrace challenges and imperfections, guiding them to see that growth is found not in a win or loss, but in having a positive mindset and mental flexibility.</p> <p>This \u201ccultural obsession with winning\u201d or \u201cprofessionalization\u201d of youth sports is one reason kids are losing their enthusiasm for sports, says Ryan Snelgrove, a professor of sport and recreation management at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada.</p> <p>According to data from the Aspen Institute\u2019s <a href=\"https://projectplay.org/state-of-play-2022/participation-trends\">Project Play</a>, the percentage of US children aged six to 12 who regularly played a team sport dropped from 45% in 2008 to 37% in 2021 \u2013 a trend mirrored in Canada, England and Australia. A 2024 <a href=\"https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/27833/Professionalization-of-youth-sports-can-lead-to\">report</a> from the American Academy of Pediatrics reveals that 70% of children quit sports by age 13, often citing that they simply have stopped having fun.</p> <p>\u201cKids say: \u2018I stopped playing because I don\u2019t have fun anymore,\u2019\u201d says Snelgrove. When Amanda Visek, a sports scientist and associate professor at the George Washington University, asked children to list and rank factors that make sports fun, winning came in 48th place. She found that kids valued \u201ctrying your best\u201d, \u201cgetting play time\u201d and bonding with teammates more highly.</p> <p>Snelgrove has examined efforts to make youth sports more inclusive and boost participation. About a decade ago, Ontario Soccer and Canada Soccer launched player-development strategies that eliminated scoring and standings for children under 12, aiming to shift the focus from winning to skill development, cooperation and fun \u2013 the reason why parent and coach Lund\u2019s teams don\u2019t use scoring and standings.</p> <p>Not everyone supports this shift.<strong> </strong>\u201cA silent majority of people are by and large indifferent in the sense that they understand that there is a value for not always keeping score for focusing on other components. And then, there are those who would be happy to see a little bit more competition,\u201d says Lund.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Some parents worry that removing the focus on winning undermines lessons in emotional strength and sportsmanship, says Snelgrove. \u201cWe have a lot of \u2018character building\u2019 social goals for youth sports,\u201d he says, \u201cbut they\u2019re a bit divorced from what developmental psychologists say is appropriate for children under 12, which is to focus mostly on enjoyment and developing cooperative skills.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSports become a battleground in the culture wars,\u201d Snelgrove adds.

      "bodyText": "My boyfriend\u2019s parents coached youth sports teams in the 90s, so they have many anecdotes about how children handle winning and losing. Two cousins on separate soccer teams were so competitive that the one who lost would refuse the post-game high-five, instead retreating to some nearby bushes to cry. A little girl used to kick opponents with her ice skates during hockey; another refused to pass because her dad gave her cash for every goal she scored. One boy, when his team lost, lay flat out on the ice and simply wouldn\u2019t get up. There\u2019s a general consensus that, in addition to boosting fitness, youth sports impart valuable life skills, like teamwork and discipline. Winning and losing are especially significant, because they prepare children for the setbacks and challenges they will face in adult life. Expert opinion on the topic is not uniform, but many agree with that general logic. \u201cWinning and losing experiences are crucial,\u201d says Dr Billy Garvey, a developmental and behavioral pediatrician and author of Ten Things I Wish You Knew about Your Child\u2019s Mental Health. For children, especially those aged five to 12, learning to navigate the ups and downs of competition is a stepping stone to stable self-esteem and resilience, he tells me. Garvey has a three-year-old daughter who, he tells me, is particularly competitive. \u201cWhen she loses, I ensure that I connect with her, validate her frustration, anger or feeling that it\u2019s unfair,\u201d he says. Once she\u2019s calmer, he adds, \u201cI can help her learn the lesson in losing, by saying something like: \u2018See how happy your little brother Charlie is that he won? I bet that feels nice for him.\u2019\u201d \u201cDisappointment should always be complemented with unconditional love and support,\u201d says Garvey. When kids are supported through losing, they benefit psychologically from the understanding that their worth is not tied to their performance, and that their effort and growth matter more than winning, he says. Meanwhile, winning can be a \u201cgenuine opportunity to take pride in themselves when that effort has been successful\u201d. Jordan Lund has three children under age eight and coaches youth hockey, baseball and soccer in Squamish, British Columbia, in Canada. He agrees that kids need to experience competition, though a gentle approach is key. \u201cKids like to be challenged,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have a fire and spirit in them to root for their teammates\u2019 success and to accomplish things themselves.\u201d Lund\u2019s teams don\u2019t use scoring or standings yet, but he believes it\u2019s important for kids to learn about winning and losing, provided coaches create a psychologically safe environment. That means no yelling at kids to \u201clook alive\u201d or embarrassing those who fumble a play. \u201cSome of the coaches we had in the 80s were not so conscious of that,\u201d Lund remembers. *** Yet the environment of youth sports can often be shaped by a different set of values \u2013 one that prioritizes performance and victory above all else. Some experts argue that, in recent decades, youth sports, once a space for fun and personal development, have become increasingly high-stakes arenas where children are treated like miniature professional athletes. \u201cSport as a whole is becoming more competitive,\u201d says Jaclyn Ellis, a Chicago-based mental-performance coach who works with athletes in their pre-teens and older. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming harder for athletes to accept failure because the pressure to perform is so intense, even at young ages.\u201d Ellis observes this in junior leagues, too, where parents of children who express early interest or skill at a certain sport may route their child toward a path of specialization and intense training, hoping it will lead to scholarships and a career. Ellis says over-ascribing to the win/lose binary is \u201ccalled \u2018all-or-none thinking\u2019\u201d, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very black-or-white, but most of the time, performance is not just good or bad \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of grey area.\u201d Rigid thinking can make losing a threat to a player\u2019s sense of self, and also render winning joyless. Ellis described one 14-year-old soccer player\u2019s body language after a successful play. \u201cShe scored a goal and walked back, shoulders drooping, and her coach was like: \u2018What, no celebration?\u2019 and she just said: \u2018Well, it\u2019s my job to score a goal. Why should I celebrate that?\u2019\u201d Ellis recounts. For perfectionists, this mindset can make them reluctant to even try unless they\u2019re sure they can succeed flawlessly. \u201cWhat is that teaching us?\u201d Ellis asks. \u201cWe\u2019re not willing to get out of our comfort zone, not even willing to try.\u201d Ellis uses cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques to help young athletes see that their worth isn\u2019t tied to perfect outcomes. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to rewire the brain to understand that \u2018all or none\u2019 thinking is hurtful to your mind and performance,\u201d she says. Instead, she encourages young athletes to embrace challenges and imperfections, guiding them to see that growth is found not in a win or loss, but in having a positive mindset and mental flexibility. This \u201ccultural obsession with winning\u201d or \u201cprofessionalization\u201d of youth sports is one reason kids are losing their enthusiasm for sports, says Ryan Snelgrove, a professor of sport and recreation management at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. According to data from the Aspen Institute\u2019s Project Play, the percentage of US children aged six to 12 who regularly played a team sport dropped from 45% in 2008 to 37% in 2021 \u2013 a trend mirrored in Canada, England and Australia. A 2024 report from the American Academy of Pediatrics reveals that 70% of children quit sports by age 13, often citing that they simply have stopped having fun. \u201cKids say: \u2018I stopped playing because I don\u2019t have fun anymore,\u2019\u201d says Snelgrove. When Amanda Visek, a sports scientist and associate professor at the George Washington University, asked children to list and rank factors that make sports fun, winning came in 48th place. She found that kids valued \u201ctrying your best\u201d, \u201cgetting play time\u201d and bonding with teammates more highly. Snelgrove has examined efforts to make youth sports more inclusive and boost participation. About a decade ago, Ontario Soccer and Canada Soccer launched player-development strategies that eliminated scoring and standings for children under 12, aiming to shift the focus from winning to skill development, cooperation and fun \u2013 the reason why parent and coach Lund\u2019s teams don\u2019t use scoring and standings. Not everyone supports this shift. \u201cA silent majority of people are by and large indifferent in the sense that they understand that there is a value for not always keeping score for focusing on other components. And then, there are those who would be happy to see a little bit more competition,\u201d says Lund. *** Some parents worry that removing the focus on winning undermines lessons in emotional strength and sportsmanship, says Snelgrove. \u201cWe have a lot of \u2018character building\u2019 social goals for youth sports,\u201d he says, \u201cbut they\u2019re a bit divorced from what developmental psychologists say is appropriate for children under 12, which is to focus mostly on enjoyment and developing cooperative skills.\u201d \u201cSports become a battleground in the culture wars,\u201d Snelgrove adds. Debates over the value of participation trophies often reflect broader societal concerns about giving children the opportunity to develop grit. For instance, in 2023, North Carolina Republican senators introduced legislation to enact a statewide ban on youth sports awards \u201cbased solely on participation\u201d. In 2018, when USA Hockey shifted its focus away from scoring and standings for junior players, there was little fanfare \u2013 intentionally. \u201cWhen you challenge [people\u2019s] beliefs, they dig their heels in pretty quick,\u201d Ken Martel, senior director of player and coach development at USA Hockey, tells me. Martel says USA Hockey is seeing growing registration: youth player rates increased 12% between 2009 and 2022. In the category for eight-year-olds and under, registration increased 94%. Soccer, meanwhile, has emerged as the most popular sport with Canadian children. It\u2019s not possible to say how de-emphasizing scoring has affected these numbers, but it apparently hasn\u2019t hurt.

      "bodyText": "A new legal petition filed by more than 170 top environmental groups demands that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) begin monitoring for microplastics in drinking water, an essential first step to reining in pollution viewed as one of the nation\u2019s most pressing public health threats. The scale of microplastic water pollution, the extent to which the substance is lodged throughout human bodies, and the many health implications have come into sharp focus in recent years, but the EPA still has not taken meaningful action, public health advocates say. The petition pushes the agency to begin monitoring microplastics as an emerging contaminant under the Safe Drinking Water Act in 2026. \u201cThe EPA has been thinking about it, but they have not been acting, and the goal here is to get them to act,\u201d said Erin Doran, a senior attorney at Food &amp; Water Watch, one of the petitioners. Microplastics are microscopic bits of plastics that are either intentionally added to products or shed from larger products containing plastic, from clothing to tires to cookware. The substance has been found in the clouds, atop Mount Everest, in deep ocean trenches and in the Arctic. It can contain any number of 20,000 plastic chemicals, and often is attached to highly toxic human-made compounds \u2013 like PFAS, bisphenol and phthalates \u2013 linked to cancer, neurotoxicity, hormone disruption or developmental toxicity. Microplastics have been found to cross the brain and placental barriers, and those who have them in their heart tissue are twice as likely to have a heart attack or stroke during the next several years. Independent testing has found them in virtually all drinking water samples tested, and other research estimated the average person ingests about 4,000 particles in drinking water annually. California last year became the first state to start monitoring for the substance. So far, the EPA has only identified the Safe Drinking Water Act\u2019s Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule as a potential mechanism for monitoring microplastics instead of committing to tracking them, Doran said. The law requires the EPA to begin monitoring for a new set of emerging contaminants, such as microplastics, every five years. The proposed list will be assembled in the coming year, and a final group of chemicals to monitor will be published in early 2026. The agency has also opened conversations with \u201cstakeholders\u201d about the rule, Doran said, but it has not indicated it will include the substance in the upcoming monitoring program. \u201cThe importance of acting now \u2026 is because it happens in five-year cycles, and those delays could cascade down the line,\u201d Doran said.

Trump\u2019s allies involved with environmental issues, including those in the chemical industry, leadership in Congress and water utilities, have said they want to rewrite the Safe Drinking Water Act, which would probably make it more difficult to regulate new pollutants, such as microplastics, in water.

Inside it\u2019s a cross between a car boot sale and a mechanically minded pharaoh\u2019s tomb, a wonderland of paraphernalia that extends from a doubledecker Glasgow tramcar of 1901 to an Antarctic-crossing Sno-cat, to a rubber duck whose shape is sufficiently like Jupiter comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko that scientists used it to model the 2014 visit there by the <a href=\"https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co8454486/toy-duck-used-in-preparation-for-the-rosetta-probe-mission-2014-toy-recreational-artefact?_gl=1*1bdi421*_gcl_au*MTIxMTcwMzM1NS4xNzMyMjgwOTcz\">Philae lander</a>.

The objects are arranged, he says, like buildings on city blocks, rising and falling in height and density, with a long, high stack of vehicles along one side. Around this hall are two levels filled with 18 miles of shelving, in long aisles repeating and receding towards infinity, each object tagged with its own barcode.

The presiding spirit is practical, aimed at helping curators do their job. They can now, for example, see more clearly what they have, and can photograph and film items for the benefit of research requests from distant places. Architectural artistry exists mostly as paint on the floor and subtle choices of placement. There are places, for example in an entrance sequence that look a bit cash-strapped, when you could wish for a bit more joy in the built fabric, but on the whole this is a project that has got its priorities right.

There are places, for example in an entrance sequence that look a bit cash-strapped, when you could wish for a bit more joy in the built fabric, but on the whole this is a project that has got its priorities right. Thanks to its contents, it is also magnificent. For details of how to visit the Science and Innovation Park, Wroughton, Swindon, click here.",

The Metropolitan police said a 34-year-old man was arrested on Saturday evening at an address in Hertfordshire and remained in custody. The investigation, which forced the closure of the Groucho Club earlier this week, concerns reports that a woman was raped inside the venue in Dean Street, Soho, on 13 November. The woman is being supported by specialist officers, the Met said. Earlier this week, a Westminster council licensing hearing ruled that the licence for the Groucho Club should be suspended for up to 28 days until a full hearing could take place. The initial hearing was held after concerns by the Met that the venue had breached licensing conditions and had been the scene of a serious crime. The Met said that at this stage there was no suggestion that employees of the venue were involved in the rape. The investigation into the report of a rape at the venue is being led by detectives from the Met\u2019s central west public protection team. The closure of the club, which costs up to \u00a31,500 a year to join and whose members include many well-known figures, was announced as the lucrative festive season began.

      "body": "<p>On a bright Sunday morning in occupied Paris, 23 July 1943, a German soldier was standing at the Pont de Solf\u00e9rino, watching the river go by. Suddenly, a young woman on a bicycle approached him, took out a revolver, and shot him twice in the head.</p> <p>Cycling away, she was spotted by the head of the collaborationists of Versailles, who drove his car into her, knocking her over, then handcuffed her and took her to the Gestapo offices in Rue des Saussaies, where he handed her over and collected his bounty for arresting a \u201cterrorist\u201d.</p> <p>The woman was Madeleine Riffaud, who has died aged 100. At the time of the shooting she was a 19-year-old trainee midwife and member of a resistance unit based in the Paris Faculty of Medicine. Four years previously, she and her family had left Picardy, dive-bombed by Stukas during \u201cl\u2019Exode\u201d \u2013 the mass movement of people fleeing southwards before the invading German forces in 1940. </p> <p>After the Franco-German armistice, Riffaud had returned home with her sick grandfather. At Amiens, crossing the square to the offices of the Red Cross to find a stretcher for him, she was molested by German soldiers. Their commanding officer reprimanded them, but then kicked her in the backside, sending her flying. Humiliated, she resolved that she would find others who were resisting the Germans, and join them.</p> <p>She made contact with the resistance in 1942 when she contracted tuberculosis, which she called \u201cthe Aids of our epoch\u201d, and was sent to a sanatorium for students at Saint-Hilaire de Touvet, near Grenoble. There she met Marcel Gagliardi, a medical student and young communist with links to the Front National for an Independent France (FN), a front organisation of the Communist party. They returned to Paris, where she enrolled in a midwifery school at Port Royal and joined the FN at the faculty of medicine, taking the nom de guerre Rainer, after the poet Rainer Maria Rilke. </p> <p>The armed struggle was taking off, led by the Francs Tireurs et Partisans-Main d\u2019Oeuvre Immigr\u00e9e (FTP-MOI), which suffered terrible losses. She decided to join the FTP, even though she was told that she would not survive for more than five months. Paris in July 1943 was already being rocked by demonstrations and strikes, and her attack was a dramatic agitprop designed to rouse the Parisians to revolt.</p> <p>Even more extraordinary than this feat of arms by a female resister was the fact that over six weeks Madeleine survived torture, the firing squad and deportation. Transferred to Fresnes prison and expecting to be shot, she was given a small photo of St Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux by a female prisoner, and wondered whether this protected her. In prison she also wrote poetry.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>While in prison and expecting to be shot, she was given a photo of St Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux and wondered if this protected her</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She was freed on 18 August in an exchange of prisoners organised by the Swedish consul Raoul Nordling, and returned to the resistance. As a lieutenant in the Compagnie Saint-Just she forced the surrender of a German train in Belleville tunnel and took part in fighting on the Place de la R\u00e9publique in the run-up to the liberation of Paris.</p> <p>Born at Arvillers, in the Somme region of northern France, Madeleine was the only daughter of Armande (nee Boissin) and \u00c9mile Riffaud, both primary-school teachers from the Limousin who had come to find work in this \u201cgraveyard\u201d of the first world war. She claimed that her activism was inspired by her great-great-grandfather, who had taken part in the popular uprising against Louis-Napol\u00e9on\u2019s coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in 1851 and been sent to do forced labour in Algeria, a <em>for\u00e7at</em> like Victor Hugo\u2019s Jean Valjean.</p> <p>At the liberation, Riffaud suffered from terrible depression, but her poetry brought her into contact with the surrealist poets. She said that she owed her life to Paul \u00c9luard, who virtually adopted her and saw to the publication of her first poems, Le Poing Ferm\u00e9 (The Clenched Fist, 1945), for which Picasso drew a portrait of her.</p> <p> She was briefly married to Paul Daix, a young communist who had been deported to Mauthausen concentration camp. She thought that he would look after her, while he imagined that she was like Delacroix\u2019s Liberty leading the people.

      "bodyText": "On a bright Sunday morning in occupied Paris, 23 July 1943, a German soldier was standing at the Pont de Solf\u00e9rino, watching the river go by. Suddenly, a young woman on a bicycle approached him, took out a revolver, and shot him twice in the head. Cycling away, she was spotted by the head of the collaborationists of Versailles, who drove his car into her, knocking her over, then handcuffed her and took her to the Gestapo offices in Rue des Saussaies, where he handed her over and collected his bounty for arresting a \u201cterrorist\u201d. The woman was Madeleine Riffaud, who has died aged 100. At the time of the shooting she was a 19-year-old trainee midwife and member of a resistance unit based in the Paris Faculty of Medicine. Four years previously, she and her family had left Picardy, dive-bombed by Stukas during \u201cl\u2019Exode\u201d \u2013 the mass movement of people fleeing southwards before the invading German forces in 1940. After the Franco-German armistice, Riffaud had returned home with her sick grandfather. At Amiens, crossing the square to the offices of the Red Cross to find a stretcher for him, she was molested by German soldiers. Their commanding officer reprimanded them, but then kicked her in the backside, sending her flying. Humiliated, she resolved that she would find others who were resisting the Germans, and join them. She made contact with the resistance in 1942 when she contracted tuberculosis, which she called \u201cthe Aids of our epoch\u201d, and was sent to a sanatorium for students at Saint-Hilaire de Touvet, near Grenoble. There she met Marcel Gagliardi, a medical student and young communist with links to the Front National for an Independent France (FN), a front organisation of the Communist party. They returned to Paris, where she enrolled in a midwifery school at Port Royal and joined the FN at the faculty of medicine, taking the nom de guerre Rainer, after the poet Rainer Maria Rilke. The armed struggle was taking off, led by the Francs Tireurs et Partisans-Main d\u2019Oeuvre Immigr\u00e9e (FTP-MOI), which suffered terrible losses. She decided to join the FTP, even though she was told that she would not survive for more than five months. Paris in July 1943 was already being rocked by demonstrations and strikes, and her attack was a dramatic agitprop designed to rouse the Parisians to revolt. Even more extraordinary than this feat of arms by a female resister was the fact that over six weeks Madeleine survived torture, the firing squad and deportation. Transferred to Fresnes prison and expecting to be shot, she was given a small photo of St Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux by a female prisoner, and wondered whether this protected her. In prison she also wrote poetry. She was freed on 18 August in an exchange of prisoners organised by the Swedish consul Raoul Nordling, and returned to the resistance. As a lieutenant in the Compagnie Saint-Just she forced the surrender of a German train in Belleville tunnel and took part in fighting on the Place de la R\u00e9publique in the run-up to the liberation of Paris. Born at Arvillers, in the Somme region of northern France, Madeleine was the only daughter of Armande (nee Boissin) and \u00c9mile Riffaud, both primary-school teachers from the Limousin who had come to find work in this \u201cgraveyard\u201d of the first world war. She claimed that her activism was inspired by her great-great-grandfather, who had taken part in the popular uprising against Louis-Napol\u00e9on\u2019s coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in 1851 and been sent to do forced labour in Algeria, a for\u00e7at like Victor Hugo\u2019s Jean Valjean. At the liberation, Riffaud suffered from terrible depression, but her poetry brought her into contact with the surrealist poets. She said that she owed her life to Paul \u00c9luard, who virtually adopted her and saw to the publication of her first poems, Le Poing Ferm\u00e9 (The Clenched Fist, 1945), for which Picasso drew a portrait of her. She was briefly married to Paul Daix, a young communist who had been deported to Mauthausen concentration camp. She thought that he would look after her, while he imagined that she was like Delacroix\u2019s Liberty leading the people. But, she says, they were both \u201cin pieces\u201d and their marriage did not survive the birth of their daughter, Fabienne, who inherited her TB. After the war Riffaud threw herself into journalism, writing for the communist paper L\u2019Humanit\u00e9 and other leftwing publications. She claimed not to have read Marx and Engels, citing only the line that \u201ca people who oppress another can never be a free people\u201d. While reporting on the struggle against French colonialism in Vietnam, she met the poet Nguy\u00ean \u00d0inh Thi in 1951 and lived with him in North Vietnam for four years. During the Algerian war, her car was ambushed by the pro-settler Organisation Arm\u00e9e Secr\u00e8te (OAS) in 1962, and she was injured.

She published a memoir, On l\u2019Appelait Rainer (They Called Her Rainer), in 1994. Blind in later years, she was cheered in her Paris flat by the song of the exotic birds she kept. Fabienne predeceased her. \u2022 Marie Madeleine Armande Riffaud, resistance fighter and journalist, born 23 August 1924; died 6 November 2024",

The senior Labour MP voted against changing the law because she fears vulnerable people will get swept up in the assisted dying route when \u201cactually what they really need is access to hospice care and proper end-of-life care\u201d. The Commons backed a bill proposed by the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater by 330 votes for to 275 against on Friday, in a significant move towards giving eligible people greater choice over the way they die. Leadbeater has given repeated assurances that the bill will be measured and appropriate safeguards will be put in place to ensure that nobody is pressed into assisted dying. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, faced calls during the parliamentary debate to \u201cput firm commitments on palliative care on the table\u201d whether or not the bill becomes law. Already, some MPs who backed the bill on Friday have signalled they could consider changing their mind further along the process because of their concerns around safeguarding. Raising questions once again over the state of palliative care in England and Wales, Abbott told the BBC\u2019s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme: \u201cWe\u2019re moving to a situation where it will be cheaper for a GP to get a very ill person to sign on the dotted line for assisted suicide than to find them a place in a hospice.\u201d Meanwhile, Pat McFadden, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, indicated on Sunday that people may have to pay to fund an assisted dying system.

In developing countries, they can mean outright hunger.</p> <p>Sometimes these price jumps follow extreme weather events, as in the case of the Spanish floods. Scientists tell us such events have already become more common as a result the climate crisis, and will continue to multiply. Or the jumps may result from the higher temperatures that have become a new and alarming normal, forcing farmers to rethink longstanding cultivation patterns.</p> <p>A paper for the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/publication/world-economic-situation-and-prospects-july-2024-briefing-no-182/\">UN\u2019s Department for Economic and Social Affairs</a> recently said: \u201cStaple crops like corn, soya beans, wheat, rice, cotton and oats exhibit suboptimal growth when exposed to excessive heat.\u201d</p> <p>It went on to warn that the diminishing availability of water was another damaging factor \u2013 with the wider spread of pests and diseases \u2013 as climate patterns changed.</p> <p>If a single foodstuff is affected, or a defined region, the impact in shoppers\u2019 baskets, in the developed world at least, may be minimal: retailers can source alternative producers, and shoppers can substitute other products. But economists are increasingly starting to assemble evidence that global heating is putting systemic upward pressure on food inflation \u2013 as well as injecting volatility into the food production system worldwide.</p> <p>The challenges can be compounded by climate-related transport bottlenecks, as when the number of ships that could transit the Panama Canal each day had to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/22/changing-climate-casts-a-shadow-over-the-future-of-the-panama-canal-and-global-trade\">cut because of low water levels</a>.</p> <p>Research <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-01173-x\">published earlier this year</a> in the journal Communications Earth &amp; Environment found that climate pressures could add on average anything from 0.9 to 3.2 percentage points to global food price inflation over the next decade, depending on how much hotter we allow the planet to get. In hard-hit regions, the impact can be much worse.</p> <p>This is yet another reason that action on curbing emissions is essential, and it strengthens the arguments of countries who were fighting for a bigger financial settlement from the rich world at the Cop29 summit. But even on the best-case scenario, climate-related price chaos is already here to stay.</p> <p>All which raises the question of whether policymakers have the tools to cope with this new era of uncertainty. Whacking up interest rates is not meant to be the right response to supply shocks anyway but it seems particularly ill-suited to dealing with climate-induced shortages.</p> <p>The European Central Bank president, Christine Lagarde, discussed some of these issues last year at the central bankers\u2019 annual gabfest in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230825~77711105fe.en.html\">in a speech</a> that questioned whether conventional monetary policy could work in what she called \u201can age of shifts and breaks\u201d. (Lagarde also referred to other important structural changes, such as the geopolitical reordering of trade patterns.)</p> <p>The economist Isabella Weber has shown that corporations have extraordinary pricing power in the grip of shocks such as this, which they use to build profit margins at the expense of consumers.</p> <p>She believes governments may have to use unconventional approaches to managing the resulting inflation \u2013 including price caps, and potentially even building up <a href=\"https://us.boell.org/sites/default/files/importedFiles/2024/06/25/policy-paper-buffer-stocks-against-inflation.pdf\">buffer stocks of staple foods</a> for emergencies.</p> <p>The latter sounds like an extreme measure, but Liz Truss\u2019s energy price guarantee \u2013 a drastic intervention in the UK\u2019s energy market to shield households from soaring bills after the Russian invasion of Ukraine \u2013 would have been unthinkable, until it wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>Clearly, a significant part of the response to climate-induced price rises should also be to invest in global resilience in the face of the onrushing crisis: flood defences, more weather-resistant crop varieties, and research into tackling pests and diseases.</p> <p>But as the economist Andrew Sissons <a href=\"https://acjsissons.medium.com/what-can-governments-do-about-the-cost-of-living-2fc314c4d6d0\">argued recently</a>, in the current political environment there is a problem with many of these solutions \u2013 they are costly, and long term.</p> <p>Judging by the spate of global elections over the past 12 months in which incumbents have been turfed out, voters have little patience for the price of staples rocketing. The cost of a box of eggs featured repeatedly in the US campaign, for example.</p> <p>There is little sense either that the cash-strapped public are prepared to bear the costs of insulating the economy against structural shifts such as these \u2013 or that politicians are willing to discuss the trade-offs honestly. And populists, including Reform in the UK, are ever-ready to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/apr/08/reform-uk-criticised-for-claiming-funding-nhs-and-reaching-net-zero-are-at-odds\">pounce on environmental spending</a> as wasteful and unnecessary.</p> <p>Ed Miliband\u2019s green investment dash in the UK may be an honourable exception \u2013 but Labour\u2019s current plans are a shadow of the \u00a328bn a year once promised, and the payback in terms of lower bills looks a long way off. Or, as Sissons puts it: \u201cThe things that actually work to tackle cost of living crises may not fit neatly into electoral cycles.\u201d</p> <p>Food price shocks are only one aspect of the climate crisis, but their growing frequency is a warning sign that we are entering a new, more volatile era, with a policy toolkit created in calmer times.</p>",

In the rich world these cause inconvenience and make the lives of low-income households harder. In developing countries, they can mean outright hunger. Sometimes these price jumps follow extreme weather events, as in the case of the Spanish floods. Scientists tell us such events have already become more common as a result the climate crisis, and will continue to multiply. Or the jumps may result from the higher temperatures that have become a new and alarming normal, forcing farmers to rethink longstanding cultivation patterns. A paper for the UN\u2019s Department for Economic and Social Affairs recently said: \u201cStaple crops like corn, soya beans, wheat, rice, cotton and oats exhibit suboptimal growth when exposed to excessive heat.\u201d It went on to warn that the diminishing availability of water was another damaging factor \u2013 with the wider spread of pests and diseases \u2013 as climate patterns changed. If a single foodstuff is affected, or a defined region, the impact in shoppers\u2019 baskets, in the developed world at least, may be minimal: retailers can source alternative producers, and shoppers can substitute other products. But economists are increasingly starting to assemble evidence that global heating is putting systemic upward pressure on food inflation \u2013 as well as injecting volatility into the food production system worldwide. The challenges can be compounded by climate-related transport bottlenecks, as when the number of ships that could transit the Panama Canal each day had to be cut because of low water levels. Research published earlier this year in the journal Communications Earth &amp; Environment found that climate pressures could add on average anything from 0.9 to 3.2 percentage points to global food price inflation over the next decade, depending on how much hotter we allow the planet to get. In hard-hit regions, the impact can be much worse. This is yet another reason that action on curbing emissions is essential, and it strengthens the arguments of countries who were fighting for a bigger financial settlement from the rich world at the Cop29 summit. But even on the best-case scenario, climate-related price chaos is already here to stay. All which raises the question of whether policymakers have the tools to cope with this new era of uncertainty. Whacking up interest rates is not meant to be the right response to supply shocks anyway but it seems particularly ill-suited to dealing with climate-induced shortages. The European Central Bank president, Christine Lagarde, discussed some of these issues last year at the central bankers\u2019 annual gabfest in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in a speech that questioned whether conventional monetary policy could work in what she called \u201can age of shifts and breaks\u201d. (Lagarde also referred to other important structural changes, such as the geopolitical reordering of trade patterns.) The economist Isabella Weber has shown that corporations have extraordinary pricing power in the grip of shocks such as this, which they use to build profit margins at the expense of consumers. She believes governments may have to use unconventional approaches to managing the resulting inflation \u2013 including price caps, and potentially even building up buffer stocks of staple foods for emergencies. The latter sounds like an extreme measure, but Liz Truss\u2019s energy price guarantee \u2013 a drastic intervention in the UK\u2019s energy market to shield households from soaring bills after the Russian invasion of Ukraine \u2013 would have been unthinkable, until it wasn\u2019t. Clearly, a significant part of the response to climate-induced price rises should also be to invest in global resilience in the face of the onrushing crisis: flood defences, more weather-resistant crop varieties, and research into tackling pests and diseases. But as the economist Andrew Sissons argued recently, in the current political environment there is a problem with many of these solutions \u2013 they are costly, and long term. Judging by the spate of global elections over the past 12 months in which incumbents have been turfed out, voters have little patience for the price of staples rocketing. The cost of a box of eggs featured repeatedly in the US campaign, for example. There is little sense either that the cash-strapped public are prepared to bear the costs of insulating the economy against structural shifts such as these \u2013 or that politicians are willing to discuss the trade-offs honestly. And populists, including Reform in the UK, are ever-ready to pounce on environmental spending as wasteful and unnecessary. Ed Miliband\u2019s green investment dash in the UK may be an honourable exception \u2013 but Labour\u2019s current plans are a shadow of the \u00a328bn a year once promised, and the payback in terms of lower bills looks a long way off. Or, as Sissons puts it: \u201cThe things that actually work to tackle cost of living crises may not fit neatly into electoral cycles.\u201d Food price shocks are only one aspect of the climate crisis, but their growing frequency is a warning sign that we are entering a new, more volatile era, with a policy toolkit created in calmer times.",

It\u2019s happening in smaller, tighter, face-to-face communities.<em>\u201d</em></p> <p>For Leah Greenberg and Ezra Levin, there is a sense of deja vu. The former congressional staffers co-founded the progressive group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/08/indivisible-guide-progressives-tea-party-tactics\">Indivisible</a> in response to Trump\u2019s first win in 2016. Over the weekend after Thanksgiving that year at Levin\u2019s home in Austin, Texas, they started writing the <a href=\"https://www.indivisible.org/\">Indivisible Guide</a> to help people organise locally to fight back against the Trump agenda.</p> <p>The guide <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2018-state-of-the-union-address/anti-trump-resistance-turns-year-old-grows-n838821\">captured the public imagination</a> and inspired the creation of thousands of Indivisible groups that played a <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/we-are-indivisible-excerpt-progressives-obamacare-affordable-care-act-907275/\">crucial part in saving</a> former president Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law. The Indivisible movement also helped Democrats regain the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections.</p> <p>Since the 2024 election, Greenberg and Levin have released a new guide, <a href=\"https://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=u001.W2s9Mti6a-2FCtRP1HQII2ZQC4OHvV3Q-2FGrz1T5Boim9NI6OupH-2Fe69M-2FiBDrs-2F6frxlEJ-2FEzBWGNtsF4STX3E3-2F0TjEBxVgWHta9F7sbqCOYzTVAwwdmfAiEtkGflYfKKI6bjI8ybHG1mMWhphH5pqg-3D-3Djrfv_bf4JG6rVotaFp8XsYJMcbJfioizxoiq-2Fqxyutbjh0J6VFnnbrxfRSj2Enh3scfnONS0-2BKCPNmg9OH09szdWruCmRTiu2xRjWK8S3zqXkh9P9XJDZn3gUHS5DQlOJTD8MDivp0zPbd8Am-2BKRQEri7JSlKclH7-2BK-2F85GwNotsu5pLdXOSRdsrecq4zm7sEJxFsdLJOIKPjMWgSfx8rqJwgCjI848rSJHwPYtg5sHk5M50bRJ5W-2BHFO-2Bx7vlhwSW9kykIHP3-2FJMCPcLIKjG4qBC1snI-2FerCgEucTijN9PfUzo6dyuPM-2F-2Fx5SlkyONblTiY3iNp4mNqH5udxRB-2FPZqsetRkO9d-2FfFY41DN-2BsSx5giv-2BNgsCLEvUEAJMm6ERTUuuptE8GyVSiQ-2BTnDoOtH3bkmw-3D-3D\">Indivisible: A Practical Guide to Democracy on the Brink</a>, focusing on local action and targeted campaigns, and note that about a hundred new Indivisible groups have since formed in red, blue and purple states.</p> <p>Levin said: \u201cI\u2019m encouraged that the general response I\u2019m getting from our folks on the ground is that they\u2019re determined.

They\u2019re going through a lot of different parts of the stages of grief but they do not show signs of just totally checking out.\u201d</p> <p>A further question mark concerns the media. Some outlets are reaffirming a commitment to accountability journalism but grappling with fatigue, audience disengagement and loss of trust while trying to avoid amplifying every Trump outburst. Ominously, the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/10/25/washington-post-endorsement-president/\">declined to endorse a presidential candidate</a> ahead of election day.</p> <p>The first resistance was not entirely liberal and Democratic. It was a coalition that also included \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans. Among the most pugnacious was the Lincoln Project, a political action committee founded in December 2019 by moderate conservative operatives to eviscerate Trump and noted for its eye-catching, hard-hitting adverts.</p> <p>One of its cofounders, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/27/rick-wilson-lincoln-project-dismiss-trump-ron-desantis\">Rick Wilson</a>, is determined to keep at it.

We\u2019re still in this fight.</p> <p>\u201cWe lost an election as part of a big coalition. We were on the wrong side of the electoral fight but we\u2019re not on the wrong side of history so we\u2019re going to keep punching and trying to make sure that both the people and the policies he wants to impose on America aren\u2019t successful.\u201d</p> <p>For all the monument scale of the Women\u2019s March, it did not prevent women losing a fundamental right the following year when the supreme court ended the constitutional right to abortion. Wilson, who worked as a consultant and political ad maker for numerous candidates and state parties, commented: \u201cAs excited people were by the whole pussy hat thing, it didn\u2019t work, so if people are taking a beat in the broad movement to decide what messaging they need to do and what\u2019s the smart way to do it, that\u2019s a good outcome.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a sign of weakness. That\u2019s a sign of strategic caution and posture, taking a moment to figure out what\u2019s going to work. Because, again, pink pussy hats didn\u2019t close the deal. They didn\u2019t change the outcomes that we needed to have.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI\u2019m results-oriented and win-oriented and even though some people are depressed and down and beat up right now, you got to at some point lick your wounds and get back up, get back in the fight.

      "bodyText": "For years, the cable news channel MSNBC has been a reliable liberal voice in the US media landscape, but amid the return of Donald Trump to the White House and its own business upheavals the network is now in crisis. The world\u2019s richest man, and close Trump ally, Elon Musk has even \u2013 possibly jokingly \u2013 repeatedly publicly touted the idea of buying MSNBC after the parent company of the channel, Comcast, recently revealed that it would spin off the cable news network. Audience fatigue with Trump\u2019s re-election and high-profile MSNBC hosts\u2019 potential missteps in reaction to that event could make it difficult for the new company to boost the channel\u2019s ratings, which were already declining before the election, and continue providing a leftwing perspective on global events, US media analysts told the Guardian. The negative reports about the channel over the last month are just the latest examples of an established US media company struggling to find its footing as people continue to drop cable television packages and instead use streaming services. But the particularly sharp recent ratings decline and reports of Musk perhaps buying the network could make it especially difficult for high-profile programming such as Morning Joe and The Rachel Maddow Show to continue providing a progressive alternative to Fox News, the analysts say. During Trump\u2019s first term, \u201cMSNBC really stood as a center for resisting and critiquing Trump,\u201d said Kathryn Cramer Brownell, associate professor of history at Purdue University and author of 24/7 Politics: Cable Television and the Fragmenting of America from Watergate to Fox News. \u201cIt remains to be seen if they are able to forge an identity and a political viewership in opposition to Trump or not,\u201d she added. In 2016, an average of 4.2 million people tuned into CNN, Fox News and MSNBC, according to the Pew Research Center. In 2022, that number decreased to 3.8 million. MSNBC briefly saw a significant ratings increase during the 2020 tumult of the Covid-19 pandemic, Black Lives Matter protests and presidential election, but they later again declined. In October, the Comcast president said the company was considering spinning off its cable networks, including CNBC and MSNBC into a separate company. Then last week, the company made an official announcement. Since election day, MSNBC has averaged about 521,000 viewers each day, a 38% decrease from its 2024 average before 5 November, according to data from Nielsen. Then Morning Joe hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort to speak with him about \u201cabortion, mass deportation\u201d and his threats of \u201cretribution against political opponents and media outlets\u201d, Scarborough said on air about the meeting. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see eye-to-eye on a lot of issues, and we told him so,\u201d Scarborough said, but they agreed to continue a dialogue. Afterwards, the hosts faced a significant backlash and ratings decrease. \u201cThey made a fundamental business error,\u201d Jeff Jarvis, a journalism professor and author, said. \u201cThere is now a large new ecosystem of independent media, and people left the Washington Post and they are leaving MSNBC, and that worries me.\u201d Brownell said she was not surprised by the morning show hosts meeting with the president-elect. \u201cMedia businesses frequently rely on cultivating relationships with political leaders and presidential administrations. It\u2019s part of how they remain relevant,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you can see the backlash with a show that kind of leans left and relies on those critics of Trump as their audience members.\u201d The future of such shows is also uncertain because of Comcast\u2019s decision to spin off the cable news networks along with channels such E!, USA and the Golf Channel into a separate company. \u201cWhen you look at our assets, talented management team and balance-sheet strength, we are able to set these businesses up for future growth,\u201d said Brian L Roberts, chairman and CEO of Comcast. After the announcement, Donald Trump Jr, joked on X that Musk should buy MSNBC, to which Musk replied: \u201cHow much does it cost?\u201d A spinoff does not mean the company is for sale. Musk, who owns X, was one of Trump\u2019s biggest backers this election and is now reportedly part of his inner circle, had previously described MSNBC as the \u201cutter scum of the Earth\u201d. CNN reported that billionaires with \u201cliberal bona fides\u201d have also expressed interest in buying MSNBC. \u201cI fear that [Musk] could try to buy MSNBC, and I fear that Comcast could be immoral enough to sell it to him,\u201d Jarvis said. Even if one of the liberal billionaires buys the network, its ability to be profitable in the long-term while providing left-leaning news and commentary is uncertain as people stop subscribing to cable. But after the 2016 election and the victor\u2019s constant attacks on the media, many news organizations, including MSNBC, got a so-called \u201cTrump bump\u201d. Could that happen again once he takes office? \u201cIf there is a Trump bump, I suspect it will be delayed,\u201d said Marty Kaplan, who holds the Norman Lear Chair in entertainment, media and society at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. \u201cIt may take a few beats for doomscrollers to get past the nausea.

As far back as January, the president of low-pay campaign group One Fair Wage recalls telling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democratic</a> leaders in Washington DC that voters were worried about the cost of living.</p> <p>\u201cIt just went on deaf ears,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the biggest challenges we faced was they kept wanting to talk about the economy. And we kept saying, it\u2019s not about <em>the</em> economy, it\u2019s about <em>our</em> economy: it\u2019s about <em>my</em> economy, <em>my</em> ability to pay for eggs and gas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd so, it was no surprise to us that people did not turn out, why people did not feel incredibly motivated \u2013 whether they didn\u2019t vote or they voted for Kamala or they voted for Trump,\u201d said Jayaraman, director of the food labor research center at University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThere was a universal feeling of \u2018you\u2019re not listening to us.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>A single mom working three jobs as a waitress, and struggling to make ends meet on a sub-minimum tipped wage, is \u201cnot going to take time out of her three jobs to vote for either person\u201d, she added. \u201cThere\u2019s no future for the party unless they really address the needs of working people. And I use the word \u2018address\u2019. It isn\u2019t just running on the issue.\u201d</p> <h2>Democrats face calls to act</h2> <p>Sam Taub has worked as a server for the past 10 years in Michigan, one of the key election swing states, which <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/06/trump-sweeps-michigan-swing-states/76090868007/\">swung</a> from Joe Biden in 2020 to Donald Trump in 2024. Taub was not that surprised by this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/donald-trump-wins-us-presidential-election\">result</a>.</p> <p>\u201cYou see a lot of generalizations of people who live in the midwest, people who are working class and people who are working-class in the midwest,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as somebody who is one of those people, it is a little bit frustrating to hear people say that they\u2019re listening to you \u2013 and then not actually listen to you.</p> <p>\u201cThe message that Democrats really need to understand is that they can\u2019t assume that they already know what people think and what people need.\u201d</p>    <p>Taub is one of hundreds of service industry workers who backed an open letter, organized by One Fair Wage in the wake of the 2024 election results, urging the Democratic party to do more to address the needs of working people.</p> <p>Democrats at the state level need to fight to protect workers rights even more given the upcoming second <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\">Trump administration</a>, he argued, and <a href=\"https://www.wkar.org/wkar-news/2024-11-21/one-fair-wage-pushes-lawmakers-to-keep-minimum-wage-increase-as-planned\">push back </a>against industry efforts to scale back or prevent policies, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/27/no-tax-on-tips-unlivable-minimum-wages\">raising the sub-minimum wage</a> for servers in Michigan, from taking effect.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious Donald Trump is not going to protect workers\u2019 rights, so it\u2019s really important for politicians at the state level to do everything that is within their power to protect workers,\u201d said Taub. \u201cBy getting rid of the sub-minimum wage, which is something that\u2019s happening gradually, we can help a lot of people.\u201d</p> <p>Juan Carlos Romero, a bartender in New York City, has worked in the restaurant industry for 16 years. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to try to make ends meet\u201d in this economy, he said.</p> <p>Under Trump workers in the service industry aren\u2019t going to see improvements, he suggested, arguing that the incoming administration\u2019s proposals \u2013 such as eliminating taxes on tips \u2013 overlook the fundamental issue that so many service workers are in precarious economic circumstances because they rely on tips and sub-minimum hourly wages.</p> <p>Democrats must use the final weeks before Trump takes office \u201cto support us\u201d, he added. \u201cI think our desperation comes from the reality that we see, and especially if wages stay like this, [that] they\u2019re going to continue to affect people on a daily basis. So it really is a call to action that is desperately needed by folks in the industry.\u201d</p> <h2>Fears of recession</h2> <p>Campaigners and academics fear the Democratic party\u2019s losses of the White House and Senate majority, and its failure to retake the House majority will leave workers on lower incomes \u2013 especially immigrants \u2013 vulnerable.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the consequences of this election is that the government backs away from having people\u2019s back when they want to join a union,\u201d said Sharon Block, executive director of the Center for Labor and a Just Economy at Harvard Law School. \u201cThere\u2019s just a cool irony to that that I think is just devastating: this is a time when people need to be in a union more than ever.\u201d</p> <p>Deportation plans targeting undocumented and temporary workers are already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/07/trump-mass-deportation-immigration-fears\">inciting fear</a> among these workers. Immigration groups are <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/h-1b-revamp-languishes-in-bidens-unfinished-immigration-agenda\">pushing</a> Biden to solidify protections for immigrants before he leaves office in January.</p> <p>\u201cI think that the anti-immigrant fervor out of Trump and his acolytes is terrifying and defies humanity,\u201d said Judy Conti, director of government affairs at the National Employment Law Project. \u201cAnd I think immigrant workers everywhere have reason to be worried about discrimination, potential violence, workplace raids.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs, and the impact they may have on the costs of basic goods and necessities, are also causing concern.</p> <p>\u201cIf they\u2019re not talking about raising wages, which they\u2019re not, but they\u2019re talking about making all of the goods and services that we need for our day-to-day lives 20% more expensive,\u201d warned Conti. \u201cI have fears of recession, and certainly fears that things are going to be less affordable for the people who can\u2019t afford it most.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats who still hold office nationwide are facing calls to help such people when Trump reaches the White House. \u201cEven if you fail,\u201d the <a href=\"https://onefairwage.typeform.com/OFWopenletter\">One Fair Wage letter</a> said, \u201cat least we\u2019ll see you fighting for once.\u201d</p>",

Democrats at the state level need to fight to protect workers rights even more given the upcoming second Trump administration, he argued, and push back against industry efforts to scale back or prevent policies, such as raising the sub-minimum wage for servers in Michigan, from taking effect. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious Donald Trump is not going to protect workers\u2019 rights, so it\u2019s really important for politicians at the state level to do everything that is within their power to protect workers,\u201d said Taub. \u201cBy getting rid of the sub-minimum wage, which is something that\u2019s happening gradually, we can help a lot of people.\u201d Juan Carlos Romero, a bartender in New York City, has worked in the restaurant industry for 16 years. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to try to make ends meet\u201d in this economy, he said. Under Trump workers in the service industry aren\u2019t going to see improvements, he suggested, arguing that the incoming administration\u2019s proposals \u2013 such as eliminating taxes on tips \u2013 overlook the fundamental issue that so many service workers are in precarious economic circumstances because they rely on tips and sub-minimum hourly wages. Democrats must use the final weeks before Trump takes office \u201cto support us\u201d, he added. \u201cI think our desperation comes from the reality that we see, and especially if wages stay like this, [that] they\u2019re going to continue to affect people on a daily basis. So it really is a call to action that is desperately needed by folks in the industry.\u201d Fears of recession Campaigners and academics fear the Democratic party\u2019s losses of the White House and Senate majority, and its failure to retake the House majority will leave workers on lower incomes \u2013 especially immigrants \u2013 vulnerable. \u201cOne of the consequences of this election is that the government backs away from having people\u2019s back when they want to join a union,\u201d said Sharon Block, executive director of the Center for Labor and a Just Economy at Harvard Law School. \u201cThere\u2019s just a cool irony to that that I think is just devastating: this is a time when people need to be in a union more than ever.\u201d Deportation plans targeting undocumented and temporary workers are already inciting fear among these workers. Immigration groups are pushing Biden to solidify protections for immigrants before he leaves office in January. \u201cI think that the anti-immigrant fervor out of Trump and his acolytes is terrifying and defies humanity,\u201d said Judy Conti, director of government affairs at the National Employment Law Project. \u201cAnd I think immigrant workers everywhere have reason to be worried about discrimination, potential violence, workplace raids.\u201d Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs, and the impact they may have on the costs of basic goods and necessities, are also causing concern. \u201cIf they\u2019re not talking about raising wages, which they\u2019re not, but they\u2019re talking about making all of the goods and services that we need for our day-to-day lives 20% more expensive,\u201d warned Conti. \u201cI have fears of recession, and certainly fears that things are going to be less affordable for the people who can\u2019t afford it most.\u201d Democrats who still hold office nationwide are facing calls to help such people when Trump reaches the White House. \u201cEven if you fail,\u201d the One Fair Wage letter said, \u201cat least we\u2019ll see you fighting for once.\u201d",

The Save Blackwater River campaign, in partnership with a citizen action group, toppled all four Milton politicians running for re-election last month in a remarkable victory for grassroots activism. As a result, plans for the 25-acre wastewater treatment facility that was to have been constructed partly on wetlands feeding the environmentally sensitive river are in suspension. And the new intake of Milton city councilors must work quickly with its other four members who were not up for election to decide how to deal with toxic effluent the previous panel wanted to spray on to fields that would, environmental engineers concluded, pose a likely threat to its drinking water. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a cliche to say it, but it really is a new day in this city,\u201d said Pam Mitchell, co-founder of the Concerned Citizens of Milton group that helped promote the four new councilors, who are all residents or business owners there. \u201cThe people here are very protective of their river and their community, and these elections showed that.

The Florida department of environmental protection (DEP) has ordered the city to stop releasing treated effluent from it into the Blackwater, which is popular for fishing and other water-based recreation, by the end of next year. But she said residents could not accept the city\u2019s solution, namely the proposed new plant on a clay-based site vulnerable to flooding, close to the banks of the Blackwater, and which geologists hired by the citizens\u2019 groups determined was a potential hazard to the river in the event of the failure of a sewer line running under it. Outside developers, championed by some city officials and councilors, were in line for a lucrative payday to build the new, higher capacity plant, that protesters say was being railroaded through with insufficient discussion or input from residents.

He also formed intimate relationships with three other women while concealing from them the fact that he was married with children and was a police spy.</p> <p>Another key question centres on longstanding claims \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/undercover-with-paul-lewis-and-rob-evans/2017/jan/16/probe-into-claim-that-police-spy-set-fire-to-debenhams-expected-to-end-by-july\">previously aired in</a> parliament \u2013 that Lambert was a member of a coordinated group that planted incendiary devices in Debenhams stores in 1987.</p> <p>If true, it would mean that a serving police officer, tasked with preventing crime, set alight a leading high street store in a major act of criminal damage. The current value of the damage caused would now be in the region of \u00a3960,000.</p> <p>Lambert was commended for his undercover work and credited with gaining the information that led to the convictions of activists for the arson attacks on the Debenhams stores.</p> <p>He is likely to be questioned about how he obtained detailed information about the conspiracy which he submitted in a series of reports to his superiors.</p> <p>Two activists who admit their involvement in the arson plot have testified at the inquiry. Geoff Sheppard, who was jailed over the plot, said a group of four activists carried out the arson attacks.</p> <p>He said Lambert was \u201can integral part\u201d of the group, acting as a \u201ccharismatic, forceful\u201d leader. \u201cHe was definitely very keen on carrying out these actions. He was definitely very active \u2026 in the planning stages pushing it forward, wanting to make this thing happen.\u201d</p> <p>Sheppard added that Lambert and the three activists met in a house in Haringey, north London on 11 July 1987, collected the incendiary devices and then set off to plant them in their designated branches of Debenhams. Lambert\u2019s target was the Harrow branch, which was later that day set on fire, he added.</p> <p>The second activist, Paul Gravett, echoed Sheppard\u2019s version of events. Gravett was never arrested for his part in the plot. However, he has come forward to break decades of silence and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/13/spy-cops-inquiry-undercover-officer-accused-debenhams\">detail his involvement to the inquiry</a>. In return, he has been granted immunity from prosecution.</p> <p>He said Lambert had initiated the arson plot by suggesting that the activists should step up their protests against the fur trade. He added the activists believed that Lambert was a trusted campaigner as he had by then committed other criminal acts to further the cause of animal rights.</p> <p>Another activist, Helen Steel, also accused Lambert of being involved in the arson attacks. The inquiry has heard evidence that Lambert and the rest of the group held clandestine meetings in parks in the run-up to the attacks.

      "bodyText": "Four witnesses have testified at a public inquiry that an undercover police officer carried out an arson attack on a well-known high street department store while pretending to be an ardent animal rights campaigner. Their testimony directly contradicts consistent denials by the undercover officer Bob Lambert, who says he did not set fire to a London branch of Debenhams, causing damage totalling \u00a3340,000. Starting on Monday, the undercover policing inquiry is due to question Lambert for a week about his controversial deployment of infiltrating animal rights campaigners and anarchists for five years in the 1980s. It is the first time Lambert has been formally held to account in public for his conduct as an undercover officer. He is a prominent figure in the scandal surrounding the police\u2019s use of undercover officers to spy on tens of thousands of political activists between 1968 and 2010. Lambert will also be questioned about how he fathered a child with an activist and then vanished for decades from their lives. He also formed intimate relationships with three other women while concealing from them the fact that he was married with children and was a police spy. Another key question centres on longstanding claims \u2013 previously aired in parliament \u2013 that Lambert was a member of a coordinated group that planted incendiary devices in Debenhams stores in 1987. If true, it would mean that a serving police officer, tasked with preventing crime, set alight a leading high street store in a major act of criminal damage. The current value of the damage caused would now be in the region of \u00a3960,000. Lambert was commended for his undercover work and credited with gaining the information that led to the convictions of activists for the arson attacks on the Debenhams stores. He is likely to be questioned about how he obtained detailed information about the conspiracy which he submitted in a series of reports to his superiors. Two activists who admit their involvement in the arson plot have testified at the inquiry. Geoff Sheppard, who was jailed over the plot, said a group of four activists carried out the arson attacks. He said Lambert was \u201can integral part\u201d of the group, acting as a \u201ccharismatic, forceful\u201d leader. \u201cHe was definitely very keen on carrying out these actions. He was definitely very active \u2026 in the planning stages pushing it forward, wanting to make this thing happen.\u201d Sheppard added that Lambert and the three activists met in a house in Haringey, north London on 11 July 1987, collected the incendiary devices and then set off to plant them in their designated branches of Debenhams. Lambert\u2019s target was the Harrow branch, which was later that day set on fire, he added. The second activist, Paul Gravett, echoed Sheppard\u2019s version of events. Gravett was never arrested for his part in the plot. However, he has come forward to break decades of silence and detail his involvement to the inquiry. In return, he has been granted immunity from prosecution. He said Lambert had initiated the arson plot by suggesting that the activists should step up their protests against the fur trade. He added the activists believed that Lambert was a trusted campaigner as he had by then committed other criminal acts to further the cause of animal rights. Another activist, Helen Steel, also accused Lambert of being involved in the arson attacks. The inquiry has heard evidence that Lambert and the rest of the group held clandestine meetings in parks in the run-up to the attacks. Steel said she attended one of these meetings at which Lambert was present, but declined to participate in the plot. She said Lambert later spoke to her and other campaigners about his role in the attacks. Steel was deceived into a two-year relationship by another undercover officer, John Dines, whom she exposed after piecing together clues. Belinda Harvey had an 18-month relationship with Lambert in 1987 and 1988 when he did not disclose to her his true identity. She said Lambert discussed the plan to set fire to the Debenhams stores \u201con several occasions before they happened\u201d. When asked if she was clear that he was going to be one of the people planting the devices, she replied: \u201cHundred per cent he was one of the people.\u201d Harvey thought the arson attacks were \u201cso wrong\u201d and tried to dissuade him, but he replied :\u201cOh, I can\u2019t; I am in it too deep.\u201d Lambert denies her account and says he did not know about the attacks in advance.",

But over the last decade the capacity of trees and soil to absorb excess CO\u2082 has shrunk by 20% due to deforestation and climate change.</p> <p>The main culprit, according to the report, is unsustainable agricultural practices, which are responsible for 80% of forest loss. These techniques, which include heavy use of chemical inputs, pesticides and water diversion, also erode soil, diminish water supplies and contaminate ecosystems.</p> <p>In the short term, this intensive extraction can be more profitable, but it soon leads to lower crop yields and poorer nutrition quality of harvests.

      "bodyText": "Land degradation is expanding worldwide at the rate of 1m sq km every year, undermining efforts to stabilise the climate, protect nature and ensure sustainable food supplies, a study has highlighted. The degraded area is already 15m sq km, an area greater than Antarctica, the scientific report says, and it calls for an urgent course correction to avoid land abuse \u201cirretrievably compromising Earth\u2019s capacity to support human and environmental wellbeing\u201d. The paper aims to galvanise global efforts to sustainably manage land ahead of a summit of 200 nations this week in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, under the UN convention on combating desertification (UNCCD). This convention is the least well known of three international meetings, along with the climate and biodiversity Cops, that were established at the 1992 Earth summit to ensure the planet remained habitable. The new report underscores how all these issues are interlinked and contributing to a series of environmental and humanitarian crises. The UNCCD executive secretary, Ibrahim Thiaw, whose organisation collaborated on the report, said: \u201cIf we fail to acknowledge the pivotal role of land and take appropriate action, the consequences will ripple through every aspect of life and extend well into the future, intensifying difficulties for future generations.\u201d The synthesis study, Stepping Back from the Precipice, was produced at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), which analysed the land use issue in the context of the planetary boundaries framework. It noted that until recently land ecosystems absorbed nearly one-third of human-caused carbon dioxide pollution, even as those emissions increased by half. But over the last decade the capacity of trees and soil to absorb excess CO\u2082 has shrunk by 20% due to deforestation and climate change. The main culprit, according to the report, is unsustainable agricultural practices, which are responsible for 80% of forest loss. These techniques, which include heavy use of chemical inputs, pesticides and water diversion, also erode soil, diminish water supplies and contaminate ecosystems. In the short term, this intensive extraction can be more profitable, but it soon leads to lower crop yields and poorer nutrition quality of harvests. In a growing number of cases it results in desertification and dust bowls. The report identifies several degradation hotspots in dry regions such as south Asia, northern China, the High Plains and California in the US, and the Mediterranean. A third of humanity now lives in drylands, which include three-quarters of Africa. This has dire humanitarian effects because low-income countries and socioeconomic groups are disproportionately affected. Women face increased workloads and health threats, while children are at greater risk of malnutrition and educational setbacks. Extra pressure comes from climate disruption, which intensifies land degradation through prolonged droughts and intensified floods. The authors said the report showed the importance of taking an integrated approach to these problems. \u201cPolicymakers should strengthen their focus on land as a cornerstone of global sustainability,\u201d said Claudia Hunecke, a scientist at PIK. \u201cNeglecting land degradation risks pushing humanity beyond its safe operating space, exacerbating resource pressures, poverty, migration and conflict. \u201cPolicymakers must address both the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of land use. The interconnectedness of land use with the Earth system and human livelihoods can act as an important lever to achieve sustainability goals.\u201d",

Krik Krak the cricket (Nicole Louise Lewis) and the Blue Rinse Fairy (Michael Bertenshaw) are part of the drama but step outside it, for fun and games, to talk directly to the audience. \u201cWhen I say \u2018Krik\u2019, you say \u2018Krak,\u2019\u201d says Krik Krak, and we do so, in rap-like rhythm. There are some nice innovations, including a sweet scene leading to the birth of Pinocchio and a surprise twist in the figure of the ageing Blue Rinse Fairy, who talks about brain fog and is not all she seems. But the mendacious wooden puppet\u2019s quest to become human is, in all honesty, too much like children\u2019s entertainment to carry cross-generational appeal. Under the direction of Omar F Okai, the swerves into audience participation feel like pauses, slowing the flow of the story, especially in the first half. Trish Cooke\u2019s script is clear, simple and emphatically basic, with instructive lessons for children, moral or otherwise, pointed out and summarised repeatedly. The plinky incidental sound and Stewart J Charlesworth\u2019s luminous set, with its riot of colour, are sometimes reminiscent of an arcade game \u2013 and instead of planting his five gold coins, Pinocchio even loses them in a slot machine. The production is winning with its songs though, which are quickly catchy. The music by Robert Hyman, and lyrics by Hyman and Cook, comprise an exuberant blend of reggae, soca, disco, soul and funk. Collymore\u2019s Pinocchio is a mischievous charmer who busts some good moves and sings his heart out. The rest of the cast are as spirited. While it may not grip the adults as much as the children, it exudes festive warmth. \u2022 At Theatre Royal Stratford East, London, until 4 January",

Outside of that, I think it was a very similar kind of contest. Again, they are a very high press and high tempo team. And I thought we, in general, to look over the 90 minutes, I think we coped with that a little bit better than we did the other night. The objective tonight was to finish strongly, and I thought the subs that we brought on made a big impact that we did.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Yet again, however, Brazil proved more clinical than the Matildas, something the coach reflected on. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThere was a couple of times where we were in great positions and had we just executed the pass better or made a better decision we\u2019d have been in Because, the downfall of the way Brazil plays that, if you get out of the pressure, there are real opportunities to hurt them.

Disappointed we couldn\u2019t a the result but I think we put out a better performance tonight. </p> <p>\u201cWe obviously looked at [Thursday\u2019s] performance, and I think there were some changes that we made. You saw that in the formation that we came out with. I think it was frustrating for us because we did create a lot of opportunities. And there was possibly a few, almost one-on-one situations that if the play had of run on, we might have got a few chances. So I think we did much better today, creating those 100% chances then we did in the last game.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>And on the rising talent in the Brazilian side. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cI think they\u2019ve got a whole squad of players, honestly. I think they have variety in their players as well. You\u2019ve got a player that can come into the six [role], into the midfield and then also into the back line.

There will be plenty of lessons and questions to take from tonight and Thursday\u2019s games, as well; especially given that, like Brazil, they too are going through their own period of renewal. What lessons can be taken from <em>As Canarinhas</em>?</p> <p>One thing that should be certain, though, as if we needed another reminder, is that Caitlin Foord is very, very, very good at football.

      "bodyText": "And with that, I think I\u2019m done. My name\u2019s been Joey Lynch and it\u2019s been a great pleasure to have your company throughout tonight\u2019s minute-by-minute coverage of Australia\u2019s 2-1 loss to Brazil. If you\u2019re a Matildas fans, you\u2019ll inevitably be down about these back-to-back losses and hoping for a bounce-back against Taiwan in the week ahead but geez, if you\u2019re a football fan, you\u2019ve got to be excited about some of the talent coming through this Brazilian team. Three years out from a home World Cup and they\u2019re already looking as if they\u2019re getting ready to make some noise. And remember, if you\u2019ve enjoyed watching the Matildas in action tonight \u2013 or at any point in recent years \u2013 you can catch some of Australian football\u2019s best talent and up-and-coming prospects by getting along to or watching the A-League Women and even, when it starts in the new year, your local NPLW competition. And now it\u2019s the turn of caretaker coach Tom Sermanni to talk about the game with Network Ten, asked first about the difference between his outfit and Brazil. \u201cThe difference is, first and foremost, the referee gave a couple of early yellow cards, so that settled the game down a little bit. Outside of that, I think it was a very similar kind of contest. Again, they are a very high press and high tempo team. And I thought we, in general, to look over the 90 minutes, I think we coped with that a little bit better than we did the other night. The objective tonight was to finish strongly, and I thought the subs that we brought on made a big impact that we did.\u201d Yet again, however, Brazil proved more clinical than the Matildas, something the coach reflected on. \u201cThere was a couple of times where we were in great positions and had we just executed the pass better or made a better decision we\u2019d have been in Because, the downfall of the way Brazil plays that, if you get out of the pressure, there are real opportunities to hurt them. And we got into positions to do that and just took the wrong options sometimes, or the pass just wasn\u2019t quite up to what it needed to be.\u201d Tameka Yallop reflecting on tonight\u2019s game on Network Ten: \u201cWe do want to play Top 10 teams. That\u2019s what we wanted to, here on home soil as well. Disappointed we couldn\u2019t a the result but I think we put out a better performance tonight. \u201cWe obviously looked at [Thursday\u2019s] performance, and I think there were some changes that we made. You saw that in the formation that we came out with. I think it was frustrating for us because we did create a lot of opportunities. And there was possibly a few, almost one-on-one situations that if the play had of run on, we might have got a few chances. So I think we did much better today, creating those 100% chances then we did in the last game.\u201d And on the rising talent in the Brazilian side. \u201cI think they\u2019ve got a whole squad of players, honestly. I think they have variety in their players as well. You\u2019ve got a player that can come into the six [role], into the midfield and then also into the back line. So honestly, I think they\u2019ve got a whole team of Marta\u2019s coming through.\u201d Emily van Egmond speaking to Network 10: \u201cThey got the better of us on set pieces, something we have to get better at. But I thought towards the end, the girls put in a great shift, and probably unlucky not to come up with an equalizer.\u201d Brazil has come to Australia and taken two games from two from the Matildas; the rejuvenation this South American power is undergoing ahead of a home World Cup in 2027 adding another major milestone after their silver medal earlier this year. They deserved both of these wins, too. They created more and better chances than the Matildas across both games and proved clinical when they needed to be. Playing in just her third and fourth caps, 23-year-old Amanda Gutierres, who added an assist tonight to go alone with her brace from Thursday evening, looks as if she\u2019s going to be an absolute star. The Matildas will now head to Victoria for two games against Taiwan where, despite several of their bigger European names being expected to head back to their clubs, they\u2019ll be expected to win. There will be plenty of lessons and questions to take from tonight and Thursday\u2019s games, as well; especially given that, like Brazil, they too are going through their own period of renewal. What lessons can be taken from As Canarinhas? One thing that should be certain, though, as if we needed another reminder, is that Caitlin Foord is very, very, very good at football. Sam Kerr continues to near a return and will be a massive in for this side but across this past year, Brazil being the latest example, the Arsenal attacker has shown that she will still have a huge role to play when she does. 90+7 Mins: We\u2019re entering last roll of the dice areas now, the frustration evident on Gielnik as she has a forthright exchange with Bruninha after another attack can\u2019t find an equaliser. 90+5 Mins: More desperate efforts to find an equaliser as they launch more balls into the box. This time, though, Brazil are able to grab the ball and get it up the other end, where forces Micah into another save. The visitors now have a corner which is promptly wasted. 90+2 Mins: The Energizer Bunny has posters of Ellie Carpenter on its wall \u2026 that\u2019s good, I\u2019m going to Tweet/BlueSky that. The fullback gets forward yet again and wins her side a corner with her hustle. It falls to Raso for a shot at the back post but as with Dudinha looming, she drags it wide. 90+1 Mins: Brazil burst forward in transition and finds space in behind \u2026 only for the flag to go up to indicate she was offside when the pass to her was played. 90 Mins: Increasing desperation from the Matildas as they try to find an equaliser. Brazil\u2019s attacking shift feels a bit of a memory now as they clear the ball away and there\u2019s no attacker in the vicinity to pressure Micah as she collects the ball near the halfway line. 89 Mins: Kennedy pulls rank to take the free kick. She bends it towards goal but Lorena has the time to take a step to her right and punch it over the bar. 88 Mins: The Matildas get things going with a throw in, with Raso \u2013 don\u2019t tell her defeats in friendlies don\u2019t matter, either \u2013 winning a corner. That set piece comes to nothing but soon afterwards the Matildas get forward and Galic wins a free kick just on the edge of the penalty area. 87 Mins: Results don\u2019t matter in friendlies? Don\u2019t tell that to Carpenter, who is having a word with the referee to make sure all of the time lost to Lorena\u2019s treatment is to be added on. 85 Mins: Gielnik forces a strong save from Lorena after she turns Haas and lashes a shot towards the top corner. Replays showed it looked to be going wide but the keeper couldn\u2019t take that chance and forced it out for a corner. Lorena falls awkwardly on her left shoulder after she punches away the corner \u2013 her arms getting bent up awkwardly as she falls on it \u2013 and requires treatment. 83 Mins: Brazil\u2019s admirable attacking intent forces a turnover and the ball is worked to Nycole on the right, only for Kennedy to twice close down her crosses. Australia quickly advances back in the other direction only for Gielnik to have her shot charged down. 81 Mins: There\u2019s been a few more changes for Brazil, with Bruninha coming on for Portilho, Fe Palermo for Kak\u00e1, and La\u00eds Estevam replacing Lauren. This has been accompanied by a switch to a more attacking formation, too, as the visitors look for a third that would put this game to bed. 79 Mins: Carpenter is running her guts out \u2013 one wonders what Joe Montemurro is thinking, given that Lyon play Reims on Friday evening \u2013 again getting down the right and threatening the Brazilian backline. 76 Mins: The official crowd on the Gold Coast is 25,297, beating out the 24,644 that watched the Socceroos lose to Bahrain at this venue a few months ago. It\u2019s the 16th consecutive home sell-out for this side. 75 Mins: Nycole plays the ball out to Duda, who in turn tries to slide a pass through to Gomes on the left but there\u2019s just to much mustard on it and it goes out for a goal kick. 75 Mins: Galic plays the ball out to Carpenter on the right, who in turn combines with Raso as the Matildas get forward. After Kennedy comes up to get a bit of the action, too, the Spurs attacker sends in a cross that bounces out to Yallop but before she can get a shot off, Nycole comes up behind her like a librarian and pokes the ball away. 71 Mins: Galic shoots from the top of the box but it\u2019s a comfortable enough save for Lorena. Lauren went down injured before the shot came in and Brazil aren\u2019t happy play was allowed to continue. Both sets of players head to the dugout for a drink and further instruction as the defender receives treatment. 69 Mins: A reminder of the danger of Brazil. Another dangerous looking switch from the visitors gets the ball to Adriana on the right. Freier gets back to help the defence and puts it out for a corner. Substitute Dudinha gets her first shot of the game off that set piece after Brazil work the ball to her outside the penalty area but her long-range effort is high. 66 Mins: Haas pretty much hip checks Freier from behind, giving away a free kick. Nominally, she\u2019s signed to Internacional but after this series maybe the Broncos or Titans might be interested; we\u2019ve already seen Sheridan Gallagher make the football \u2013 league \u2013 football jump, after all! The free kick is taken quickly and springs Raso into a dangerous area of space on the right but her attempt to cut the ball back from the byline is closed down. 63 Mins: Carpenter charges straight down the middle of the park before laying it off for Raso on the right. She keeps the ball low in search of Gielnik but the ball is cleared away by Brazi. The visitors take the ball up the other end quickly but Grant wins a free kick from Portilho to end the danger. 62 Mins: Brazil make a couple of changes as Dudinha replaces Gio and Nycole Raysla replaces the dangerous \u2013 just four games into her international career and she\u2019s properly established that adjective \u2013 Gutierres. 60 Mins: Charli Grant has joined Gielnik and Galic as a waiting substitute and now replaces Nevin. The Melbourne Victory attacker replaces a fellow A-League Women striker in Heyman and Galic has replaced van Egmond. Raso stays out there \u2026 and immediately has a heavy collision with Duda. 59 Mins: Freier threatens to burst down the left flank but Kaka gets across to lay in a challenge and shuts down the danger, winning a throw in for her side. 57 Mins: The Matildas have a corner! Nevin swings it just beyond the penalty area but the Australians can\u2019t get a strong head on it. Nonetheless, they retain and recycle possession across the backline. Raso was flattened behind play before the corner, too, and looked a bit sore. Her Spurs have Everton on Sunday and with Emily Gielnik and Daniela Galic warming up, she might soon be coming off. 55 Mins: Duda gives away a free kick in a dangerous area after bringing down Yallop. The Brazilian midfielder and her dugout are none too pleased about it but Kennedy\u2019s resulting free kick goes straight into the wall. 54 Mins: Australia break quickly in transition down the right through Carpenter, their first real attack of the half. It\u2019s one that ends in disappointment, though, as van Egmond sends a wayward pass towards her right back that goes out for a Brazilian throw-in and brings the threat to a close. 53 Mins: Brazil twice find space on the right flank to drive low crosses into the box but twice the Matildas clear, the latter time for a corner. Haas meets Angelina\u2019s resulting delivery with an acrobatic looking attempt but it bounces wide. 52 Mins: It\u2019s currently 24 degrees on the Gold Coast but the humidity is sitting at 94%. How this game is still going as quickly as it is? That\u2019s beyond me. 50 Mins: Another corner, again sent short to Gutierres but this time the Matildas clear it before she can pick out a teammate. 49 Mins: Brazil swings in their eighth corner of the game \u2013 Australia has had none \u2013 but it comes to nothing. After Brazil keeps the ball in their attacking third, Prior blocks an attempted cross by Duda out for a throw-in. 48 Mins: Not the type of first impression that Prior will have wanted to make, the ball is slid past her and springs Gio into space. Fortunately for the debutant, the resulting shot goes high over the bar. 46 Mins: We are back underway on the Gold Coast, with Brazil leading the Matildas two goals to one. Confirmation of those changes, with Foord replaced by Freier and Prior coming on for Hunt. Looks like some changes are coming for the Matildas. After showing some late flashes on Thursday \u2013 albeit after Brazil had the game won \u2013 Sharn Freier will be coming on for Caitlin Foord, while Tash Prior is entering the game and, in doing so, becomes Matilda #231. Here\u2019s the goal that saw the Matildas halve the deficit in the shadow of the half-time break. Ok, everybody breath. A frantic first-half comes to a close and as was the case in Brisbane last Thursday, it\u2019s Brazil that will hold a 2-1 lead heading into the sheds. Though the Matildas often thrive in chaotic games like this, Arthur Elias\u2019 side has probably had the best of the action so far, being clinical with a couple of chances and looking the more threatening of the two sides and forcing Micah into some of important saves. Moved into the starting XI, Adriana in particular will be wondering how she hasn\u2019t scored, given the chances she has had. Though second-best, Australia has at least been better than their last opening half; able to move the ball into threatening areas a bit more than they did in the first half of the first meeting between these two sides, even if they\u2019re still not testing Lorena in the Brazilian goal as often as they would like. The transitional nature of the game is helping in that regard. Probably helping the Matildas, this game hasn\u2019t been as physical as the Battle in Brisbane was; a few early yellow cards from the referee helping to reign in some of the biff. 45+5: Some silly bugger in the crowd with a whistle has given it their own half-time whistle, fooling the ground announcer into announcing the break while the action is still happening. That has to be one of my least favourite gags that has popped up in modern football. 45+4 Mins: Foord goes on a windy run but can\u2019t find an angle towards goal and instead opts to play it to Raso, who has her cross charged down. The Matildas keep the ball in their attacking third, however, and Raso springs Carpenter into space on the right side of the penalty area. Her cross, though, is closed down too. 45+2 Mins: As she does so well, Carpenter gets forward, twists and turns and wins a free kick on the right flank. Cooney-Cross fires the free kick towards deep past the back post and Raso can\u2019t keep her attempt to send the ball back into the danger zone in. Good lord it\u2019s all happening on the Gold Coast. I can\u2019t hardly keep up with it all. But against the run of play, the Matildas have grabbed one back! Foord seizes upon a ball played down the right by Yallop, skips past Isa Haas and places a perfectly weighted pass to Raso at the back post, with the Tottenham attacker placing the ball home to halve the deficit. Foord is going to be coming off at halftime but she\u2019s left us with a reminder, she really is an absolutely incredible player. Brazil will feel they should have had a free kick for a foul by Yallop on Adriana during the buildup but there\u2019s no VAR in this game to bring it back. Amid protests from the Brazil dugout, one of their members of staff is booked. The Matildas are being overrun by a rampant Brazil and just like at the Olympics, a set piece has driven a dagger through the side in Green and Gold. A short-corner routine gets the ball to Gutierres at the top of the box, where she rounds Raso and floats in a perfectly weighted ball to the back post. Having shaken off the attention of her marker Heyman, it\u2019s met there by Lauren, who bundles the ball over the line for her first international goal and to double her side\u2019s advantage. 38 Mins: Micah is the only reason this isn\u2019t 2-0. Gutierres is played into space all on her own behind the Matildas\u2019 backline and lashes a shot towards the near-post but the Liverpool keeper is just able to keep it out. 34 Mins: Brazil again come very close to a second. And again it\u2019s Adriana. She and Portilho play a delightful one-two atop the box, the latter backheeling it back into her path, before Adriana places a shot just across the face of goal \u2013 Gutierres desperate attempt to slide in at the far post and turn it in just coming up short. 32 Mins: A threat of two goals in quick succession as a corner falls to Adriana at the back of a large pack of players, with the attacker taking a touch before lashing an effort over the bar. Space behind the Matildas costs them again. A rapid move from Brazil as Duda swings a pass across the pitch to find a wide-open Adriana and switch the play from left to right. With no support around her and two attackers to think about, Nevin is caught badly out of position as a first-time ball is played in behind for Portilho, who advances into the area and smashes the ball into the top corner of the net. 28 Mins: A free kick is swung into the box by Brazil and met with a glancing header from Duda, one that bounces just wide of Micah\u2019s near post. 27 Mins: This game is absolutely frantic at the moment, the ball pinging from one end to another like it\u2019s a game of basketball \u2013 only both teams are the Seven-Seconds-or-Less Phoenix Suns. 25 Mins: The ball falls to Adriana just inside the Matildas\u2019 penalty area on the right but she can\u2019t get a shot away before she\u2019s closed down and the ball is cleared away by Nevin. 24 Mins: Brazil\u2019s nominal third-choice goalkeeper Cl\u00e1udia is doing some warm-ups and surveying the scene after Lorena went down. Seems whatever forced Honegger off in Brisbane won\u2019t allow her to be called upon on the Gold Coast. 23 Mins: Brazil clear the initial free kick but the Matildas keep the pressure on, Raso and Foord both having attempts on goal \u2013 the latter\u2019s attempt going out for a goal kick. 22 Mins: The Matildas are putting together a period of sustained pressure, here. Carpenter forces a strong save after she lashes in a shot from an angle. The wingback collects the rebound and finds Cooney-Cross, who is brought down for a free kick in a dangerous area on the right. 21 Mins: Foord with a super ball to spring Yallop into the area, with the resulting left-footed effort forcing a save from Lorena at her near post. 20 Mins: We\u2019ve got out first stoppage of the game as Lorena goes down requiring treatment. Much to the frustration of the crowd, we saw plenty of this in Brisbane, with Honegger eventually being forced off. Both sides take advantage of the break to re-hydrate and consult with their dugouts. 18 Mins: Some better play by the Australians as they work the ball around before Nevin whips in a lethal looking ball from the left. Lorena can only parry it away as it bounces in front of her and Duda is able to boot it clear just before Raso can get to it. 17 Mins: Lauren is all over the back of Raso as the attacker tries to carry the ball into Brazil\u2019s half to an extent that I can\u2019t be certain she wasn\u2019t attempting to get a piggyback ride. She becomes the second Brazilian to see yellow. 15 Mins: Brazil still buzzing around the Australian penalty area, Kaka heading an effort straight at Micah after a cross in from the left. Pressure continues to build on the hosts. 14 Mins: van Egmond has her pocket picked in the midfield by Giovana, who carries the ball forward before sliding it across for Portilho. She lashes in a shot toward the near post that Micah puts out for a corner. 12 Mins: Foord and Adriana battle for the ball on Brazil\u2019s attacking right flank, with the former eventually blocking the latter\u2019s attempted cross for a corner. The dangerous Adriana fires on goal from range on the third phase of that corner but she can\u2019t get it on target. 10 Mins: Signs of life for the Matildas and they work the ball around the area and try to lock it in their attacking half. The move ends with Hayley Raso lashing a long-range shot in on goal that\u2019s claimed by Lorena. 9 Mins: van Egmond\u2019s long clearance falls to Foord, who almost has her shirt ripped off by Kaka as she tries to get forward. After the treatment she copped in Brisbane, Foord shoves her rival off her to the ground as the whistle is blown and claps when a yellow card is produced for the Brazilian. That early caution should serve as a tone-setter. Pull that kind of thing and you\u2019re one bad challenge away from being dismissed. 8 Mins: Kennedy comes up nursing her right ankle after being forced to chase down a ball in behind. Something to keep an eye on. 6 Mins: Australia get the ball forward and while Yallop can\u2019t turn forward, she wins a throw-in. Brazil soon win the ball back though, Gabi Portilho leaving Hunt in her wake as she streaks down the right. Her cross, however, can\u2019t find a teammate. 4 Mins: The Matildas are being put under some significant pressure early on as Angelina lashes a first time effort just wide of the goal. Micah probably had it covered but as former Matilda Grace Gill says on the coverage \u201cearly warning signs\u201d. 2 Mins: Aline Gomes charges down the left flank and puts a cross in but Australia are able to scramble it clear. Brazil keep the ball in Australia\u2019s half and moments later the ball sits up for Amanda Gutierres to lash a shot at goal, one Micah is forced to parry away. Early pressure on the Matildas. 1 Min: A poor throw-in by Brazil gives Australia an early turnover in their foes half but they can\u2019t make anything from it. The whistle has sounded and action is underway on the Gold Coast \u2013 one wonders how many schoolies are in the stands. The anthems have been sung and the action is imminent. Before we get to that, however, Ellie Carpenter will be presented with her trophy as the first-ever AFC Women\u2019s International Footballer of the Year \u2013 a gong for internationally-based players \u2013 just before kick off. Football Australia CEO James Johnson will present her with the trophy. He\u2019s a Queenslander, too, played for the Brisbane Strikers and everything. One wonders if that will come up on the broadcast. The anthems are being and it\u2019s Brazil\u2019s that is up first; Francisco Manuel da Silva absolutely knew how to write a tune. The A-League Women has opted to play through this international window but, given the host of domestic-based players that have been called up by Tom Sermanni \u2013 many of whom will join the squad and shape as likely contributors against Taiwan \u2013 the league has split its round five across two weekends \u2013 two games taking place yesterday and another four to come next week. In the first of the two games yesterday, Melbourne City looked much more comfortable than the 2-0 score line suggested as they eased to a win over Western Sydney Wanderers, while the Central Coast Mariners came-from-behind to defeat Canberra United and stay undefeated \u2013 16-year-old Tiana Fuller scoring with her first touch in professional football to spark the comeback. It\u2019s not just Australia and Brazil in action this week, of course, with plenty of other games taking place across the international window. Goals from Eug\u00e9nie Le Sommer and Amel Majri helped France beat Nigeria 2-1 at the Stade Raymond Kopa overnight, Spain and Germany recorded convincing wins over South Korea and Switzerland, and Argentina beat Colombia on penalties. The marquee match of the window took place at Wembley, where England and the United States played out a 0-0 draw in front of 78,346 fans. \ud83d\udea8Late change to the starting XI claxon\ud83d\udea8 And it\u2019s a big change, too. Steph Catley has been withdrawn from the XI and is being replaced by Courtney Nevin, with Emily van Egmond now set to captain the side in her 151st game. Before Arsenal fans go into a panic \u2013 well, too much of a panic, at least \u2013 the Matildas are calling it a precautionary measure after she felt tightness in her lower leg during the pre-match warm-up. The email inbox has been hit up by James Paraskevas, who is in a confident mood as Australia prepare to take on the Olympic silver medallists. \u201cIt was expected Brazil would win the first game. Our players are based on Europe/USA and playing more and more minutes these days. The Brazilians got their contacts in for a gig in Europe or the A League Women. I would say most are still playing in Brazil so these games are more important to them than Australia. All player will be recovered tonight for Australia and the Matildas will win the true test tonight 3-0. Easy. Goals to Heyman, Raso and Van Edmond.\u201d After Thursday was understandably all about Clare Polkinghorne, tonight will see Emily van Egmond honoured for reaching 150 caps in that game, just the fourth Australian \u2013 man or woman \u2013 to play that many senior internationals. In starting tonight, she will make her 151st appearance moving into equal second with Cheryl Salisbury on the all time caps list for an Australian footballer Tameka Yallop is interviewed on the Network 10 coverage, with the Brisbane local talking about how special it is to be playing on the Gold Coast. Steph Catley is almost certain to be headed back to Arsenal after tonight\u2019s game \u2013 they\u2019ve got a game against Aston Villa next Sunday \u2013 but I wonder if the Melbourne local would have expressed similar sentiment about playing in Geelong next week. One of the most notable features of Thursday evening\u2019s clash was the physicality that the Brazilians brought to the contest \u2013 Tom Sermanni is fielding questions about it on Network Ten\u2019s pre-game coverage. In combination with an intense press that brought a level of intensity all its own in the humid conditions, As Canarinhas committed 17 fouls \u2013 and probably getting away with another few that easily could have been called \u2013 and had Vit\u00f3ria Calhau sent off late after she picked up a second yellow card. It was an approach that frustrated Matildas\u2019 players, fans, and Sermanni, the latter hopeful that the referees adopt a stricter approach in this evening\u2019s game but, at the same time, insisting that his side are ready to match their foe\u2019s physicality. \u201cI think you have to fight fire with fire. The challenge \u2026 is that Brazil have adopted a very different style of football to what we expect Brazil to play and a different style to what most of the top teams play. \u201cThe reality is that you need to be able to match that and to adjust to play effectively against that. You have got to balance that out by looking at where the opportunities are to hurt them. A lot of that is to play a similar kind of game to them when we get the ball forward early and get one-on-one match-ups with their defenders.\u201d As you might have guessed from her being named on the bench, while there were a few reports circulating that the Brisbane game was set to be the last of her career, that 3-1 loss was Clare Polkinghorne\u2019s send-off game \u2013 not her final goodbye. Both the defender and caretaker coach Tom Sermanni were quick to clear up post-game that she would remain available for selection in this game as well as in the two games against Taiwan that will follow in Victoria next week. Then, she will hang up her legendary boots. To some observers, Australia\u2019s pace of change isn\u2019t quick enough. Since that famous victory over France in Brisbane the Matildas have mostly stuttered, underlined by their group stage Olympics exit. Ten of the 11 players who started on Thursday were veterans of both last year\u2019s World Cup squad and the group who went to Paris. Here\u2019s Jack Snape\u2019s deeper look at that Lang Park clash and the Matildas time warp. The teams are in and the Matildas made three changes to the side that lost 3-1 in Brisbane. Teagan Micah starts in place of Mackenzie Arnold in goal \u2013 making her first start since facing Canada on December 5 last year \u2013 and Queenslander Tameka Yallop and striker Michelle Heyman take their place in the outfield. Clare Polkinghorne moves to the bench after her send-off game at Lang Park while Winonah Heatley also takes up a position amongst the substitutes after making her first international start in the loss. It will be interesting to see what kind of shape the team adopts with this line-up. Will they move to a back four? Or will they retain the back five that has been a feature of their previous three games under Tom Sermanni, with Steph Catley kicking inside next to Alanna Kennedy and Clare Hunt and Yallop serving as a wing-back? Brazil are also making a change in goal, albeit that may have been a forced one given Lorena replaced an injured Natascha Honegger during Thursday\u2019s game, to go along with five changes amongst the outfielders. Newly crowned NWSL champions Angelina and Adriana as well as Lauren, Kak\u00e1, and Gio Queiroz come in for coach Arthur Elias. Howdy all and welcome to live coverage of the Matildas international friendly against Brazil at Robina Stadium on the Gold Coast. It was just 72 hours ago that these two sides were locking horns in Brisbane and it\u2019s safe to say that the hosts will be looking for both improvement and a spot of retribution; a very physical Brazil spoiling Clare Pokinghorne\u2019s send-off game at Lang Park by starting quickly before running out relatively comfortable 3-1 victors. Taking advantage of the ample early space the Matildas left behind their lines in the opening exchanges, Amanda Gutierres nabbed an early brace in just her third senior international in that one, before Gio Queiroz grabbed one of her own early in the second half after coming on in the 23rd minute for an injured Mar\u00edlia Furiel. Here\u2019s my full match report to bring you up to speed. And here\u2019s the full minute-by-minute from Martin Pegan if you want an even more expansive breakdown. Despite some rainy conditions throughout the day, Football Australia has already announced that the last of the tickets available for this evening\u2019s game have been snapped up, making this the 16th consecutive time the Matildas have exhausted ticket allocations on home soil. Kick-off time on the Coast of Gold is 6:35pm local / 7:35pm AEDT.",

Add the unbeaten 33 he ransacked with the bat \u2013 plus the fact that Harry Brook\u2019s 171 contained five slices of fortune \u2013 and it was pretty clear why Carse was named player of the match at the end of this eight-wicket win.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to say I knew this day would come,\u201d Carse said, having claimed six for 42 in New Zealand\u2019s second innings of 254 all out. \u201cBut I was always ambitious to think I can play cricket at this level. I\u2019m just very proud of today\u2019s performance.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/mar/09/cricket.englandcricketseries\">Hamilton in 2008</a> was the last time an England seamer, Ryan \u00adSidebottom, claimed 10 wickets across two innings in an overseas Test and, 1-0 up with two to play, this side now has a golden chance to become the first since that tour to claim a series win in New Zealand. Although the hosts will surely not be so generously butter-fingered in Wellington next week, having somehow dropped eight catches here.</p> <p>Like Stokes, Carse is partial to a spot of ink and on his upper left arm are a series of coordinates. They represent the city of his birth, \u00adGqeberha in South Africa (Port Elizabeth as it was previously known), and the journey tra\u00advelled to end up with three lions on his chest. It has been a bumpy ride at times, too, both a career-threatening knee injury sustained in late 2021 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/may/31/england-durham-brydon-carse-banned-after-betting-on-cricket\">a three-month ban</a> this year for forgetting that professional cricketers are barred from betting on the sport.</p> <p>The second of those sliding doors moments led to Stokes, his Durham teammate, acting as mentor, having had a few scrapes of his own back in the day. The advice was not to let the error define him as a person and Stokes is reaping the benefits. </p> <p>The England Test captain said: \u201cWhen those kinds of things come from \u00adsomeone who knows what it\u2019s like to go through certain stuff it means a bit more to the person \u00adlistening. He knows how much value I have in him as a player. I guess it might make him run a little bit harder when it\u2019s me \u00adasking him to bowl an extra over.\u201d</p>    <p>Stokes described the strapping 29-year-old as three bowlers in one: able to effect short-ball plans, keep things tight, and also home in on those pads and stumps with nip. All three qualities were on show here and not least on a fourth morning when he pinned Nathan Smith and Matt Henry lbw in the space of five balls and later returned to end Mitchell\u2019s \u00adstubborn resistance. The surface had flattened out, Stokes had a stiff back, and no&nbsp;one else looked that threatening.</p> <p>This was the first time since 2021 that Carse had claimed a five-wicket haul in first-class cricket and just the sixth of his career. While personally gratifying, it was also a reminder of England\u2019s increasing belief that Test cricket is a different beast to playing with a Dukes ball in April and that attributes trump county statistics.</p> <p>After a 40-minute lunch break for England to ponder their approach to a target of 104 \u2013 39 minutes and 59 seconds of which were probably not required \u2013 Zak Crawley followed his first-innings duck by chipping a return catch to Henry for just one. Jacob Bethell sauntered out at No&nbsp;3 and hit an unbeaten 50 from 37 balls. There was a bit of master and apprentice after he pulled the final run square, with Joe Root, unbeaten on 23 at the end of his 150th Test, putting an arm round him as they walked off.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/30/australia-vs-india-test-series-squad-josh-hazlewood-adelaide\">Josh Hazlewood ruled out of second Test in huge blow for Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pressure was off in one sense, with the Hagley Oval pitch too true not to make an England win a for\u00admality. But Bethell, a stripling aged 21, displayed the temperament and technique that makes a first-class average of 25 misleading. He hits a pretty long ball too, with the six he smoked square off fellow newcomer Smith late on a beauty. \u201cIt was set up for him to express himself,\u201d Stokes said, the tone having already been set in the chase by a typically madcap 18-ball 27 from Ben Duckett.</p> <p>In many ways Stokes was more impressed by Bethell\u2019s 10 in the first innings; a passage of play in which Henry and Tim Southee probed away with the new ball under leaden skies before New Zealand\u2019s ruinous run of eight dropped catches began. \u201cHe played and missed a lot early on,\u201d Stokes said. \u201cBut I loved the way he just scratched his mark, walked to square leg and came back to face up again. If he sticks to that attitude and swagger, I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d</p> <p>Tom Latham, Stokes\u2019s opposite number, had plenty more to ponder and so soon after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/03/cricket-new-zealand-beat-india-again-historic-test-series-win\">that monumental 3-0 win in India</a>, be it his side\u2019s slippery fingers, a first-innings 348 that was riddled with soft dismissals, or whether Southee, having announced this series will be his last, has in fact already run out of road.</p> <p>The New Zealand way is not to panic, however, and the Basin Reserve, scene of the second Test next week and the ground where their series-levelling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/28/new-zealand-england-second-test-day-five-match-report\">one-run victory</a> against England last year took place, should be a decent reminder of this.</p>",

Add the unbeaten 33 he ransacked with the bat \u2013 plus the fact that Harry Brook\u2019s 171 contained five slices of fortune \u2013 and it was pretty clear why Carse was named player of the match at the end of this eight-wicket win. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say I knew this day would come,\u201d Carse said, having claimed six for 42 in New Zealand\u2019s second innings of 254 all out. \u201cBut I was always ambitious to think I can play cricket at this level. I\u2019m just very proud of today\u2019s performance.\u201d Hamilton in 2008 was the last time an England seamer, Ryan Sidebottom, claimed 10 wickets across two innings in an overseas Test and, 1-0 up with two to play, this side now has a golden chance to become the first since that tour to claim a series win in New Zealand. Although the hosts will surely not be so generously butter-fingered in Wellington next week, having somehow dropped eight catches here. Like Stokes, Carse is partial to a spot of ink and on his upper left arm are a series of coordinates. They represent the city of his birth, Gqeberha in South Africa (Port Elizabeth as it was previously known), and the journey travelled to end up with three lions on his chest. It has been a bumpy ride at times, too, both a career-threatening knee injury sustained in late 2021 and a three-month ban this year for forgetting that professional cricketers are barred from betting on the sport. The second of those sliding doors moments led to Stokes, his Durham teammate, acting as mentor, having had a few scrapes of his own back in the day. The advice was not to let the error define him as a person and Stokes is reaping the benefits. The England Test captain said: \u201cWhen those kinds of things come from someone who knows what it\u2019s like to go through certain stuff it means a bit more to the person listening. He knows how much value I have in him as a player. I guess it might make him run a little bit harder when it\u2019s me asking him to bowl an extra over.\u201d Stokes described the strapping 29-year-old as three bowlers in one: able to effect short-ball plans, keep things tight, and also home in on those pads and stumps with nip. All three qualities were on show here and not least on a fourth morning when he pinned Nathan Smith and Matt Henry lbw in the space of five balls and later returned to end Mitchell\u2019s stubborn resistance. The surface had flattened out, Stokes had a stiff back, and no one else looked that threatening. This was the first time since 2021 that Carse had claimed a five-wicket haul in first-class cricket and just the sixth of his career. While personally gratifying, it was also a reminder of England\u2019s increasing belief that Test cricket is a different beast to playing with a Dukes ball in April and that attributes trump county statistics. After a 40-minute lunch break for England to ponder their approach to a target of 104 \u2013 39 minutes and 59 seconds of which were probably not required \u2013 Zak Crawley followed his first-innings duck by chipping a return catch to Henry for just one. Jacob Bethell sauntered out at No 3 and hit an unbeaten 50 from 37 balls. There was a bit of master and apprentice after he pulled the final run square, with Joe Root, unbeaten on 23 at the end of his 150th Test, putting an arm round him as they walked off. The pressure was off in one sense, with the Hagley Oval pitch too true not to make an England win a formality. But Bethell, a stripling aged 21, displayed the temperament and technique that makes a first-class average of 25 misleading. He hits a pretty long ball too, with the six he smoked square off fellow newcomer Smith late on a beauty. \u201cIt was set up for him to express himself,\u201d Stokes said, the tone having already been set in the chase by a typically madcap 18-ball 27 from Ben Duckett. In many ways Stokes was more impressed by Bethell\u2019s 10 in the first innings; a passage of play in which Henry and Tim Southee probed away with the new ball under leaden skies before New Zealand\u2019s ruinous run of eight dropped catches began. \u201cHe played and missed a lot early on,\u201d Stokes said. \u201cBut I loved the way he just scratched his mark, walked to square leg and came back to face up again. If he sticks to that attitude and swagger, I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d Tom Latham, Stokes\u2019s opposite number, had plenty more to ponder and so soon after that monumental 3-0 win in India, be it his side\u2019s slippery fingers, a first-innings 348 that was riddled with soft dismissals, or whether Southee, having announced this series will be his last, has in fact already run out of road. The New Zealand way is not to panic, however, and the Basin Reserve, scene of the second Test next week and the ground where their series-levelling one-run victory against England last year took place, should be a decent reminder of this.",

      "body": "<p>Reform UK is celebrating \u201can extraordinary sense of momentum\u201d north of the border, as Scotland\u2019s top polling expert predicts the populist right party could end up deciding the next Holyrood government.</p> <p>The deputy leader, Richard Tice, said his party\u2019s mood was <strong>\u201c</strong>bullish and optimistic\u201d as it held its first Scottish conference in Perth on Saturday.</p> <p>Reform took 7% of the vote in Scotland at July\u2019s general election, overtaking the Conservatives in 25 seats, despite virtually no campaigning or party infrastructure north of the border.</p> <p>Last month, in a flurry of council byelections in Aberdeenshire and Glasgow, Reform gained between 12% and 25% of first preferences, while recent polling has put the party beyond 10%, which, according to Holyrood\u2019s proportional voting system, could translate into up to 12 MSPs at the next Scottish parliament elections.</p> <p>According to Prof Sir John Curtice, Britain\u2019s most trusted elections guru, Reform\u2019s momentum is \u201cfundamental\u201d to the next Holyrood election, whether that takes place in 2026 as planned or sooner. There has been speculation this may happen if the SNP minority government struggles to pass <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/22/scottish-arts-sector-appeals-to-ministers-over-devastating-budget-cuts\">an unpopular cuts budget</a>.</p> <p>\u201cReform are running around 10% in the regional list [under Scotland\u2019s PR system, voters choose both a constituency MSP and a party from a regional list], so they are set for at least eight, possibly 12, MSPs if there were to be an early election,\u201d said Curtice. This could result in them overtaking both the Scottish Greens and Lib Dems.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the numbers for the other parties, Reform getting into Holyrood would make it impossible to form either a government that was backed solely by pro-independence parties [SNP and Scottish Greens] or a government that was backed solely by [other unionist parties] Labour, Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives.\u201d</p> <p>Tice acknowledged this prospect \u201cputs us in very interesting position\u201d.</p> <p>With the party now putting more resources into infrastructure in Scotland and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/26/more-straight-talking-how-reform-uk-is-picking-up-support-in-wales\">Wales</a>, with the aim of 30 branches north of the border by the end of the year, Reform is \u201cnot taking anything for granted, but we\u2019re making good progress\u201d, he said. \u201cWe are going to have much more representation in Scotland than anybody expected just six months ago.

      "bodyText": "Reform UK is celebrating \u201can extraordinary sense of momentum\u201d north of the border, as Scotland\u2019s top polling expert predicts the populist right party could end up deciding the next Holyrood government. The deputy leader, Richard Tice, said his party\u2019s mood was \u201cbullish and optimistic\u201d as it held its first Scottish conference in Perth on Saturday. Reform took 7% of the vote in Scotland at July\u2019s general election, overtaking the Conservatives in 25 seats, despite virtually no campaigning or party infrastructure north of the border. Last month, in a flurry of council byelections in Aberdeenshire and Glasgow, Reform gained between 12% and 25% of first preferences, while recent polling has put the party beyond 10%, which, according to Holyrood\u2019s proportional voting system, could translate into up to 12 MSPs at the next Scottish parliament elections. According to Prof Sir John Curtice, Britain\u2019s most trusted elections guru, Reform\u2019s momentum is \u201cfundamental\u201d to the next Holyrood election, whether that takes place in 2026 as planned or sooner. There has been speculation this may happen if the SNP minority government struggles to pass an unpopular cuts budget. \u201cReform are running around 10% in the regional list [under Scotland\u2019s PR system, voters choose both a constituency MSP and a party from a regional list], so they are set for at least eight, possibly 12, MSPs if there were to be an early election,\u201d said Curtice. This could result in them overtaking both the Scottish Greens and Lib Dems. \u201cIf you look at the numbers for the other parties, Reform getting into Holyrood would make it impossible to form either a government that was backed solely by pro-independence parties [SNP and Scottish Greens] or a government that was backed solely by [other unionist parties] Labour, Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives.\u201d Tice acknowledged this prospect \u201cputs us in very interesting position\u201d. With the party now putting more resources into infrastructure in Scotland and Wales, with the aim of 30 branches north of the border by the end of the year, Reform is \u201cnot taking anything for granted, but we\u2019re making good progress\u201d, he said. \u201cWe are going to have much more representation in Scotland than anybody expected just six months ago. We could well be the third biggest party in Holyrood.\u201d Scottish Conservatives play down the threat \u2013 although Reform\u2019s initial breakthrough was described as \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d by the new leader, Russell Findlay \u2013 and point to their four byelection wins in Aberdeenshire, despite the defections of two popular local councillors and Reform securing 25% of first preferences in Fraserburgh, known to be one of the most pro-Brexit areas of the country. The task for Findlay, who styles himself as a straight talker unencumbered by the party machine, is to reconnect with those switchers or stay-at-homes ahead of 2026. But privately, MSPs across the political spectrum accept that the rise of Reform in Scotland presents a challenge for every party and could significantly change the tone of Holyrood dealings. In Glasgow, Tice says Reform took votes from \u201csocially conservative Labour supporters\u201d in November\u2019s council byelections, and Curtice points out that the support it has picked up since the general election \u201cis much more diverse \u2013 a bit from the Tories, a bit from Labour, the disillusioned, dissatisfied voter. The one party they\u2019re not picking up much from is the SNP.\u201d Local reports suggest the majority of Reform organising is still happening online, but graduating to more in-person events and the establishment of local branches, in particular in Aberdeenshire. Andy Maciver, a former Tory adviser and a co-host of the Holyrood Sources podcast, says Reform still need to tailor Scotland-specific messages: he predicts they can pick up votes on the regional list \u201csimply by saying things other parties won\u2019t\u201d, for example on net zero. Tice says Reform\u2019s pledge to scrap net zero has its \u201cmost immediate impact\u201d on the north-east of Scotland, hub of the oil and gas industry, where anxiety about transition is rife. Nigel Farage did not come to Scotland during the election campaign, claiming it was \u201ctoo dangerous\u201d, but Maciver cautions that \u201ceven anti-devolution, arch-unionist Scots are not attracted to the Englishness, as opposed to the Britishness, that Farage represents\u201d. \u201cThere are people who are ready for the Reform message, but they need the right messenger to deliver it, who can handle the negative response that will go with it.\u201d",

If you\u2019re looking for a castle stay with a dog in tow, this is for you \u2013 there\u2019s no extra charge for canine guests and they\u2019ll love running in the grounds.

Our room had a four-poster bed, and plenty of space for a sofa and armchairs. There\u2019s a resident ghost, the green lady, as well as a panelled great hall, a dungeon and a friendly bar where we enjoyed smoked salmon and gin distilled about a mile away at GlenWyvis. <br><em>Rooms from \u00a370 per night; </em><em><a href=\"https://bespokehotels.com/tullochcastlehotel/\">bespokehotels.com/tullochcastlehotel</a></em></p> <h2>Thornton Castle, Laurencekirk, Aberdeenshire</h2>    <p>Run as a B&amp;B, you\u2019re staying in someone\u2019s home\u2026 that just happens to be a castle.

There are records of Thorntons owning the castle as far back as the 13th century: the current owners are descended from a lawyer who was distantly related to the original Thorntons, and bought it back in the 19th century.

It later became a ruin, before being rebuilt in the 1980s by an Aberdeen architect.

Each main bedroom has its own floor and there\u2019s an outdoor dining area and a balcony from which to gaze out to sea. Best of all is a turret-top, round viewing room, the perfect place for a drink as the sun goes down.

It\u2019s a traditional, imposing castle that combines a delightful and slightly faded interior with a 1970s conservatory \u2013 but no sniffing at that, the picture windows are magnificent to sit beside and watch the ever-changing waterscape.

The cultural centre in Cardiff is thriving and reached its 20th anniversary last Wednesday, marking the date with the unveiling of a poem by the country\u2019s national poet, Hanan Issa. Her verse, <a href=\"https://www.wmc.org.uk/en/news-and-features/dreams-building-poem-for-20th-birthday#:~:text=building%20is%20dreaming.-,Dreams%20building%2C,children%20out%20through%20glass%20doors.\">Dreams Building</a>, pays homage to the now-famous line of poetry \u2013 \u201cIn These Stones Horizons Sing\u201d<em> \u2013 </em>inscribed across the glass and slate facade of the centre.

      "body": "<p>Helen Lecointe answers the phone sounding frazzled. As the senior manager of the <a href=\"https://www.woodsidesanctuary.org.uk/\">Woodside Animal Welfare Trust</a> in Plymouth, she is tasked with not only herding cats, but accommodating them, too, and this autumn, she says, the shelter is rapidly approaching breaking point. \u201cIt just feels as if it\u2019s been nonstop,\u201d she says. Long after the supposed end of kitten season, the shelter is still receiving a steady stream of newborns, along with pregnant cats.</p> <p>Out in the community, at the Plymouth dockyards and elsewhere, large colonies of feral cats have sprung up, and are multiplying exponentially. And then there is the increasing number of often beloved pets being relinquished by their owners, who can no longer look after them or afford their care.</p> <p>With other animal rescue charities and shelters around the country reporting the same, it amounts to a national cat-astrophe, driven by the boom and bust in pet ownership since the pandemic and, lately, mounting pressure placed on owners by rising costs and insecure housing.</p> <p>At the start of this month, Woodside <a href=\"https://www.plymouthchronicle.co.uk/plymouth-animal-welfare-sanctuary-struggles-to-cope/\">was housing</a> 100 cats and kittens, with a further 80 on the waiting list. \u201cEvery pen is full,\u201d says Lecointe, but demand is showing no signs of slowing. \u201cOur welfare worker is going out, then ringing us up saying, \u2018I\u2019ve got a pregnant cat\u2019, \u2018I\u2019ve got a litter.\u2019 It really is a scramble to try to find spaces for them.\u201d</p> <p>Lecointe\u2019s colleagues are already fostering kittens in their own homes, she says; if the calls don\u2019t slow down soon, they may be forced to erect temporary pens in the staff bathrooms. \u201cIt\u2019s not much fun, to be honest.\u201d</p>    <p>Lecointe has been with the trust since 1985 and says this recent surge of cats needing help has been one of the worst in memory. Other animal rescue charities are saying the same. <a href=\"https://www.cats.org.uk/support-us/support-us-ppc?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA6Ou5BhCrARIsAPoTxrB4Mr-as_eYCFV96vVZWQxFWIHTLx54Q75EAq9UtmCOzp_mRBZy-awaAp7AEALw_wcB\">Cats Protection</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/23/number-of-abandoned-cats-soars-by-more-than-30-in-uk\"> has reported</a> a 34% increase in the number of cats and kittens being abandoned in the UK this year, putting pressure on all its services.</p> <p>\u201cThe fuller we get, the more calls we can\u2019t help in that moment \u2013 and the longer our waiting list gets, the longer people have to wait to bring their cat in,\u201d says Tania Marsh, the deputy manager of Cat Protection\u2019s UK <a href=\"https://www.cats.org.uk/find-us/find-the-ncc\">National Cat Adoption Centre</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.battersea.org.uk/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=pure_brand&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA6Ou5BhCrARIsAPoTxrDbhbGlZRkiP5lT91u3B47yZ2nuCKq7v8t4Wf6THxtzLNrvWY0TUoYaAv1qEALw_wcB\">Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home</a> has also seen a surge in stray cats, up about 8% in the past year \u2013 but most of their intake is pets being brought in by their owners to be rehomed, says Bridie Williams, the rehoming and welfare manager at the London cattery. \u201cI\u2019ve worked here for five-and-a-half years and the list of cats waiting for a space to come in is larger than I\u2019ve ever seen it\u2026 It can be overwhelming sometimes, when you see just the sheer need that\u2019s out there.\u201d</p> <p>Shelters say that the current crisis reflects the long tail of the pandemic. In the 12 months to March 2021, 3.2m UK households acquired a pet,<a href=\"https://www.ukpetfood.org/resource/pfma-releases-latest-pet-population-data.html\"> according to</a> <a href=\"https://www.ukpetfood.org/\">industry association UK Pet Food </a>(formerly the PFMA), amounting to an estimated total of 12 million cats.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Most of Battersea\u2019s intake is pets, being brought in by their owners to be rehomed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The PFMA warned of welfare concerns at the time, with just 10% of new owners expressing concern about their eventual return to the office. Cats may be more independent than dogs but, three-and-a-half years later, those grim predictions are coming to pass: cat ownership <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/23/number-of-abandoned-cats-soars-by-more-than-30-in-uk\">is now falling after</a> that pandemic surge, with many formerly favoured felines being relinquished or simply left to fend for themselves.</p> <p>For shelters, the problem is now growing as abandoned pets give birth to first-generation ferals, even going on to form sizeable colonies. That may also be a hangover from the lockdowns, which put a pause on veterinary procedures and resulted in long waiting lists. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t get your cat neutered, even if you wanted to,\u201d says Lecointe.</p> <p>But when one cat can have three or more litters in a single season, the problem can quickly escalate. In mid-October, a Cats Protection branch in Suffolk<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c99vdlv9keeo\"> announced a </a>drive to trap and neuter as many feral cats as possible, to stop their numbers from rising, even if they were found to be unsuitable for rehoming.</p> <p>Lecointe says Woodside is currently working to contain a colony on a local housing estate comprising 80 or 90 cats. \u201cObviously, we have to do that gradually, because you can\u2019t suddenly come back with that number of kittens without giving all the cattery girls a nervous breakdown.\u201d They are on the edge as it is, Lecointe says, laughing.</p> <p><em><strong>Even the changing climate</strong></em> may be playing a part. Kitten season typically lasts for five months over the summer, but in recent years cats have been reproducing for longer. Lecointe \u201ccan\u2019t help but connect it\u201d to warming temperatures. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to prove \u2013 except that we\u2019re literally seeing it.\u201d Williams, at Battersea, also says that kitten season is now year-round, sometimes taking owners by surprise. \u201cWe have seen more people coming forward with large, multi-cat households, where it\u2019s just got out of control quite quickly.\u201d</p>    <p>In the bigger picture, shelters say, the current crisis of unwanted cats is being driven by others. Many people are being forced to give up beloved pets because they can no longer afford them (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/23/uk-watchdog-launches-full-investigation-over-fears-pet-owners-are-overpaying\">with veterinary costs also having skyrocketed</a>), or they are having to move to accommodation where they are not allowed.</p> <p>Those are the most heartbreaking cases to deal with, says Lecointe. \u201cYou feel desperately sorry for the animal, having to find a new home \u2013 but you also feel sorry for the person as well, because it\u2019s not a choice, it\u2019s circumstance.\u201d</p> <p>Some owners can\u2019t face having that interaction at all. Lecointe says she will regularly arrive at work in the morning to find a box left at the sanctuary gates, with a cat \u2013 or multiple cats \u2013 inside.

      "bodyText": "Helen Lecointe answers the phone sounding frazzled. As the senior manager of the Woodside Animal Welfare Trust in Plymouth, she is tasked with not only herding cats, but accommodating them, too, and this autumn, she says, the shelter is rapidly approaching breaking point. \u201cIt just feels as if it\u2019s been nonstop,\u201d she says. Long after the supposed end of kitten season, the shelter is still receiving a steady stream of newborns, along with pregnant cats. Out in the community, at the Plymouth dockyards and elsewhere, large colonies of feral cats have sprung up, and are multiplying exponentially. And then there is the increasing number of often beloved pets being relinquished by their owners, who can no longer look after them or afford their care. With other animal rescue charities and shelters around the country reporting the same, it amounts to a national cat-astrophe, driven by the boom and bust in pet ownership since the pandemic and, lately, mounting pressure placed on owners by rising costs and insecure housing. At the start of this month, Woodside was housing 100 cats and kittens, with a further 80 on the waiting list. \u201cEvery pen is full,\u201d says Lecointe, but demand is showing no signs of slowing. \u201cOur welfare worker is going out, then ringing us up saying, \u2018I\u2019ve got a pregnant cat\u2019, \u2018I\u2019ve got a litter.\u2019 It really is a scramble to try to find spaces for them.\u201d Lecointe\u2019s colleagues are already fostering kittens in their own homes, she says; if the calls don\u2019t slow down soon, they may be forced to erect temporary pens in the staff bathrooms. \u201cIt\u2019s not much fun, to be honest.\u201d Lecointe has been with the trust since 1985 and says this recent surge of cats needing help has been one of the worst in memory. Other animal rescue charities are saying the same. Cats Protection has reported a 34% increase in the number of cats and kittens being abandoned in the UK this year, putting pressure on all its services. \u201cThe fuller we get, the more calls we can\u2019t help in that moment \u2013 and the longer our waiting list gets, the longer people have to wait to bring their cat in,\u201d says Tania Marsh, the deputy manager of Cat Protection\u2019s UK National Cat Adoption Centre. Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home has also seen a surge in stray cats, up about 8% in the past year \u2013 but most of their intake is pets being brought in by their owners to be rehomed, says Bridie Williams, the rehoming and welfare manager at the London cattery. \u201cI\u2019ve worked here for five-and-a-half years and the list of cats waiting for a space to come in is larger than I\u2019ve ever seen it\u2026 It can be overwhelming sometimes, when you see just the sheer need that\u2019s out there.\u201d Shelters say that the current crisis reflects the long tail of the pandemic. In the 12 months to March 2021, 3.2m UK households acquired a pet, according to industry association UK Pet Food (formerly the PFMA), amounting to an estimated total of 12 million cats. The PFMA warned of welfare concerns at the time, with just 10% of new owners expressing concern about their eventual return to the office. Cats may be more independent than dogs but, three-and-a-half years later, those grim predictions are coming to pass: cat ownership is now falling after that pandemic surge, with many formerly favoured felines being relinquished or simply left to fend for themselves. For shelters, the problem is now growing as abandoned pets give birth to first-generation ferals, even going on to form sizeable colonies. That may also be a hangover from the lockdowns, which put a pause on veterinary procedures and resulted in long waiting lists. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t get your cat neutered, even if you wanted to,\u201d says Lecointe. But when one cat can have three or more litters in a single season, the problem can quickly escalate. In mid-October, a Cats Protection branch in Suffolk announced a drive to trap and neuter as many feral cats as possible, to stop their numbers from rising, even if they were found to be unsuitable for rehoming. Lecointe says Woodside is currently working to contain a colony on a local housing estate comprising 80 or 90 cats. \u201cObviously, we have to do that gradually, because you can\u2019t suddenly come back with that number of kittens without giving all the cattery girls a nervous breakdown.\u201d They are on the edge as it is, Lecointe says, laughing. Even the changing climate may be playing a part. Kitten season typically lasts for five months over the summer, but in recent years cats have been reproducing for longer. Lecointe \u201ccan\u2019t help but connect it\u201d to warming temperatures. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to prove \u2013 except that we\u2019re literally seeing it.\u201d Williams, at Battersea, also says that kitten season is now year-round, sometimes taking owners by surprise. \u201cWe have seen more people coming forward with large, multi-cat households, where it\u2019s just got out of control quite quickly.\u201d In the bigger picture, shelters say, the current crisis of unwanted cats is being driven by others. Many people are being forced to give up beloved pets because they can no longer afford them (with veterinary costs also having skyrocketed), or they are having to move to accommodation where they are not allowed. Those are the most heartbreaking cases to deal with, says Lecointe. \u201cYou feel desperately sorry for the animal, having to find a new home \u2013 but you also feel sorry for the person as well, because it\u2019s not a choice, it\u2019s circumstance.\u201d Some owners can\u2019t face having that interaction at all. Lecointe says she will regularly arrive at work in the morning to find a box left at the sanctuary gates, with a cat \u2013 or multiple cats \u2013 inside. Sometimes, the box is empty by the time they get to it. Marsh, at Cats Protection, says most of the abandoned cats they take in have been left behind when their owners moved house. But there are also people who go to greater lengths to ensure that their pet won\u2019t return home, or can\u2019t be traced back to them. \u201cThey put them in a box, take them for a long drive or a long walk, put them there and then take off,\u201d says Marsh. The day we speak, one Cats Protection branch had been contacted by a member of the public who\u2019d found a sealed cardboard box containing two adult cats and two kittens, dumped in a park. Abandoning a pet violates the Animal Welfare Act in England and Wales (and is a specific crime in Scotland and Northern Ireland), but prosecution depends on being able to identify the culprit. Microchipping was made a legal requirement for all adult cats (including those kept indoors) this past June; owners who don\u2019t comply risk a fine of up to \u00a3500. Shelters are hopeful that this might result in more lost pets being returned to their owners and penalties for welfare breaches, but it may be only piecemeal protection. \u201cQuite often, you\u2019re finding a telephone number that\u2019s out of date,\u201d says Lecointe.

      "bodyText": "When Donald Trump nominated David Weldon, a 71-year-old doctor from Florida who has long questioned the safety of vaccines, to lead the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), anti-vaccine activists celebrated. The move comes as the US faces increased threats from bird flu and mpox as well as resurgences of whooping cough, measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases. \u201cHe is one of us!!\u201d the co-director of the anti-vax group Mississippi Parents for Vaccine Rights wrote on Facebook. \u201cSince before our movement had momentum. Dream Come True.\u201d \u201cEvery day more good news!\u201d wrote another prominent anti-vaxxer in West Virginia. \u201cSUCH GREAT NEWS TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d announced AutismOne, a group that has platformed the anti-vaxxer who recommended chlorine dioxide, essentially industrial bleach, to \u201ccure\u201d autism. The organization also gave Weldon an award in 2013. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely someone who\u2019s very sympathetic to the anti-vaccine cause,\u201d said Dorit Reiss, a professor of law at UC Law San Francisco. As a representative to the US House from 1995 to 2009, Weldon was a founding member of the Congressional Autism caucus, and he introduced two bills related to vaccines. One bill would have limited who can receive vaccines containing thimerosal (known as thiomersal in some countries), even though nearly all vaccines were already made without the preservative by then, despite the evidence that low doses of thimerosal are safe. Another bill sought to move the CDC\u2019s vaccine safety work to a separate, independent agency, a major change. When he left the US House of Representatives in 2008, Weldon signaled he was done with politics. Politics, at least, seemed done with him: after failed primaries for the US Senate in 2012 and the US House again in 2024, Weldon returned to practicing medicine privately. Now, Weldon has been nominated for one of the most politicized agencies in the country. But Weldon never disappeared from the public spotlight entirely. Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump\u2019s pick to lead health and human services, has frequently invoked Weldon to claim agencies like the CDC are captured by pharmaceutical interests. Weldon appeared in the anti-vaccine films Shoot \u2018Em Up and Vaxxed, which was directed by the gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield, to cast doubt on vaccines. Weldon said he attempted to slow the CDC\u2019s process of investigating the link between autism and the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine \u2013 a thoroughly discredited theory advanced by Wakefield based on unethical research. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t seem to me like we were, we were running a system that was credible,\u201d Weldon said in 2016\u2019s Vaxxed. He claimed that the agency tried to \u201cshort-circuit important research and draw premature conclusions\u201d in order to \u201cshut the door permanently and completely\u201d on any link between the MMR vaccine and autism, which research has repeatedly debunked. Children\u2019s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine organization that was led by RFK Jr until he left to pursue the US presidency last year, said that officials like Weldon would remove the federal law that compensates people for rare complications after vaccines rather than holding vaccine makers liable for each case \u2013 which could effectively end the production of key childhood vaccines. \u201cThat would be a real risk,\u201d Reiss said. \u201cIf you remove liability protection from routine childhood vaccines, manufacturers may just leave that market, leaving kids without access to these vaccines.\u201d Such a move would also make it more difficult for people to receive compensation for their very rare side effects, because their claims would need to be adjudicated individually in court. Kennedy, as HHS secretary, could also replace members of CDC\u2019s independent vaccine advisory committee. As CDC director, Weldon could reject recommendations from the advisers. The CDC makes evidence-based recommendations for immunizations, including the ones given routinely in childhood. While states aren\u2019t required to follow the recommendations, most do. Insurance companies are only required to cover vaccines that are recommended through this process, while public health departments could lose funding to administer shots to the uninsured \u2013 creating significant access issues.

Anna Leach, the chief economist at the Institute of Directors (IoD), warned that the extent of the hit to the private sector through tax rises in the budget would undermine growth and ultimately the public finances as well. \u201cAs businesses continue to absorb the consequences of the budget for their business plans, confidence has continued to plummet and is approaching the lows reached at the onset of the Covid pandemic.

      "body": "<p>A previously unknown 1580s portrait by Queen Elizabeth I\u2019s official painter has been discovered after languishing for hundreds of years in a private collection.</p> <p>Art experts hailed the \u201cwonderful\u201d discovery of a miniature by Nicholas Hilliard, which has come to light just as Hilary Mantel\u2019s Wolf Hall and all things Tudor are gripping the nation once again.</p> <p>At 58mm (2.5in) in height, the oval portrait fits in the palm of one\u2019s hand. Painted around 1585, it depicts a richly dressed young woman, thought to be Elizabeth, Lady Leighton, one of Elizabeth I\u2019s ladies-in-waiting, who captivated Sir Walter Raleigh.</p> <p>Hilliard was the great English painter of the Renaissance, appointed as the queen\u2019s official limner, or miniature painter, creating numerous portraits of her and members of her court. His exquisite, intimate miniatures are among the most revered masterpieces of European art.</p> <p>Having researched the portrait, experts Emma Rutherford and Elizabeth Goldring said it was particularly exciting to discover something that was so beautiful and in such good condition as well as completely unknown \u2013 having been in a private collection in Ireland.</p> <p>Rutherford told the Guardian: \u201cIt is a wonderful portrait, one of Hilliard\u2019s more complex portraits in terms of costume and detail. He wrote in his treatise that one of the ways to get a really good portrait is to flirt with your sitter \u2026 You can see it here, a collaboration between artist and sitter.</p> <p>\u201cThe really exciting thing is, was it meant to have been given to Sir Walter Raleigh, who had a massive crush on Lady Leighton? He wrote her love poetry. There\u2019s no evidence that anything happened. There\u2019s only evidence of him approaching her. No response from her \u2013 unless it\u2019s this miniature, which is exciting.\u201d</p> <p>Goldring, the author of an award-winning Hilliard biography, said: \u201cIt is tempting to speculate that this miniature was intended as a love token for Raleigh \u2026 Certainly, Raleigh \u2013 whose love poetry includes A Poem put into my Lady Laitons Pocket \u2013 was an ardent admirer.\u201d</p> <p>Raleigh began that poem: \u201cLady farewell whome I in silence serve/Woulde god thou knewest the depth of my desire \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Goldring said: \u201cWas this miniature a present for Raleigh, to put in his pocket, thus reciprocating for the gift of this poem?\u201d</p> <p>Leighton (n\u00e9e Knollys), whose mother was the niece of Anne Boleyn, became a gentlewoman of the privy chamber, tending to the queen\u2019s personal needs, such as preparing her clothing. In 1578 she married Sir Thomas Leighton, a soldier and diplomat.</p> <p>In this portrait, she is wearing an elaborate court dress, decorated with white bows and gold and diamond jewels, a large \u201ccartwheel\u201d ruff and a feather hairpiece and pearl in her curled auburn hair.</p> <p>Rutherford said Hilliard\u2019s miniature of Raleigh of around 1585, now in the National Portrait Gallery, depicts him in a similar manner, including the ruff. She said: \u201cThat ruff had quite a specific fashion span. So, of all the images of her to come to light, this is the one that\u2019s closest to his attempt to woo her.\u201d</p> <p>The portrait\u2019s sitter could easily be mistaken for Elizabeth I, Goldring said.

      "bodyText": "A previously unknown 1580s portrait by Queen Elizabeth I\u2019s official painter has been discovered after languishing for hundreds of years in a private collection. Art experts hailed the \u201cwonderful\u201d discovery of a miniature by Nicholas Hilliard, which has come to light just as Hilary Mantel\u2019s Wolf Hall and all things Tudor are gripping the nation once again. At 58mm (2.5in) in height, the oval portrait fits in the palm of one\u2019s hand. Painted around 1585, it depicts a richly dressed young woman, thought to be Elizabeth, Lady Leighton, one of Elizabeth I\u2019s ladies-in-waiting, who captivated Sir Walter Raleigh. Hilliard was the great English painter of the Renaissance, appointed as the queen\u2019s official limner, or miniature painter, creating numerous portraits of her and members of her court. His exquisite, intimate miniatures are among the most revered masterpieces of European art. Having researched the portrait, experts Emma Rutherford and Elizabeth Goldring said it was particularly exciting to discover something that was so beautiful and in such good condition as well as completely unknown \u2013 having been in a private collection in Ireland. Rutherford told the Guardian: \u201cIt is a wonderful portrait, one of Hilliard\u2019s more complex portraits in terms of costume and detail. He wrote in his treatise that one of the ways to get a really good portrait is to flirt with your sitter \u2026 You can see it here, a collaboration between artist and sitter. \u201cThe really exciting thing is, was it meant to have been given to Sir Walter Raleigh, who had a massive crush on Lady Leighton? He wrote her love poetry. There\u2019s no evidence that anything happened. There\u2019s only evidence of him approaching her. No response from her \u2013 unless it\u2019s this miniature, which is exciting.\u201d Goldring, the author of an award-winning Hilliard biography, said: \u201cIt is tempting to speculate that this miniature was intended as a love token for Raleigh \u2026 Certainly, Raleigh \u2013 whose love poetry includes A Poem put into my Lady Laitons Pocket \u2013 was an ardent admirer.\u201d Raleigh began that poem: \u201cLady farewell whome I in silence serve/Woulde god thou knewest the depth of my desire \u2026\u201d Goldring said: \u201cWas this miniature a present for Raleigh, to put in his pocket, thus reciprocating for the gift of this poem?\u201d Leighton (n\u00e9e Knollys), whose mother was the niece of Anne Boleyn, became a gentlewoman of the privy chamber, tending to the queen\u2019s personal needs, such as preparing her clothing. In 1578 she married Sir Thomas Leighton, a soldier and diplomat. In this portrait, she is wearing an elaborate court dress, decorated with white bows and gold and diamond jewels, a large \u201ccartwheel\u201d ruff and a feather hairpiece and pearl in her curled auburn hair. Rutherford said Hilliard\u2019s miniature of Raleigh of around 1585, now in the National Portrait Gallery, depicts him in a similar manner, including the ruff. She said: \u201cThat ruff had quite a specific fashion span. So, of all the images of her to come to light, this is the one that\u2019s closest to his attempt to woo her.\u201d The portrait\u2019s sitter could easily be mistaken for Elizabeth I, Goldring said. In fact, an 18th-century note on its back reads: \u201cThis Picture of Queen Elizabeth is done from the life by either Old Hilliard or Old Isaac Oliver [Hilliard\u2019s sometime pupil]. It was given to me 1720 by a very old Lady a great great Neice [sic] of one of the Queens maids of Honor.\u201d In their catalogue description, Goldring and Rutherford dismiss that likeness. \u201cThe miniature does depict a lady with similar colouring to Elizabeth I,\u201d they say. \u201cHowever \u2026 the face is younger \u2013 and arguably much prettier \u2013 \u2026 the hairline less recessed. Moreover, the sitter\u2019s clothing and jewellery \u2013 though indicative of high rank and status \u2013 are not as opulent as that typically seen in Hilliard\u2019s miniatures of Elizabeth I.\u201d The anonymous owners had retrieved the portrait from an old jewellery box after reading an article by Rutherford and Goldring about another miniature. Rutherford, of the Limner Company in London, will be exhibiting it at London Art Week from Monday. It is priced at about \u00a3120,000. \u201cMonday will be the first time it\u2019s been seen in public \u2013 ever,\u201d she said.",

Their visit comes as US president-elect, <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, prepares to take office in late January. Trump, who has claimed he could end the war in 24 hours, has characterised the level of US military assistance to Ukraine as a drain on American resources, and has argued the US contributes too much to Nato, relative to Europe. </p> <p>\u201cFrom day one of the war, the EU has stood by the side of Ukraine,\u201d <a href=\"https://x.com/eucopresident/status/1863119372962689369\">Costa posted on X</a> alongside an image of himself, Kallas and EU enlargement chief Marta Kos arriving via train earlier today. \u201cFrom day one of our mandate, we are reaffirming our unwavering support to the Ukrainian people.\u201d Costa, a former prime minister of Portugal, is tasked with coordinating the work of the EU\u2019s national leaders and chairing their summits. At a ceremony in Brussels on Friday, he said everyone was yearning for peace after more than 1,000 days of war, \u201cespecially the embattled and heroic Ukrainian people\u201d.</p> <p>As prime minister of Estonia, which borders Russia, Kallas emerged as one of the most staunch defenders of Ukraine, leading efforts to increase military assistance to Kyiv and tighten sanctions against Russia. Moscow this year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/13/russia-puts-estonian-prime-minister-kaja-kallas-on-wanted-list\">put her on a wanted list</a> for destroying Soviet-era monuments. Neither Kallas nor Costa, however, can make specific pledges of further aid to Ukraine as this requires the support of the EU\u2019s national governments. The EU says its institutions and member countries have made available about $133bn in Ukraine aid since the start of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine in 2022, but future support remains uncertain especially if Trump reduces US support.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-674c28798f0816561c49fcaf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-12-01T09:26:12.280Z\">9.26am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Romanians are casting ballots in a parliamentary election sandwiched between a two-round presidential race that has plunged the EU and Nato member country into unprecedented turmoil after allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference.</p> <p>Sunday\u2019s vote will elect a new government and prime minister and determine the formation of the country\u2019s 466-seat legislature.

The Russian defence ministry has said its forces have gained control over two settlements \u2013 Illinka and Petrivka \u2013 in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donetsk region. We have not yet independently verified this claim. Russian forces hold a little less than 20% of Ukraine\u2019s territory and have advanced through Donetsk region over the past two months at their fastest rate since March 2022, according to open source data. They are approaching Kurakhove and the town of Pokrovsk to the north, a key transportation hub. Pokrovsk was once home to about 50,000 people. For more than a decade \u2013 after Vladimir Putin seized parts of Donetsk oblast in 2014 \u2013 it has been a Ukrainian military centre, as well as a rail and road hub.

      "body": "<p>This week I was all geared up to slag off Rachel Reeves and now, thanks to Michael Caine, I can\u2019t. I hope you\u2019re happy, Michael. Is that what you wanted? To close down any centrist criticism of the government? Because that\u2019s what you\u2019ve done.</p> <p>Let me explain. Michael Caine, a great film star and an astute, relatable and popular public figure, has expressed his support for that petition for another general election. You know, the one that was set up a week or so ago by a pub owner from the Midlands and then got bigged up by Elon Musk. It accuses the government of having gone back on promises it made during the election campaign and, at the time of writing, it\u2019s got 2.8m signatures, one of them, presumably, Michael Caine\u2019s.</p> <p>Keir Starmer\u2019s response when asked about it was that it \u201cisn\u2019t how our system works\u201d and he is right. Michael Caine knows he\u2019s right. Michael Caine is 91. He\u2019s seen a fair few elections go against his wishes over the years and he understands, and has previously accepted, what then happens: the people he doesn\u2019t approve of get to have a proper go at governing for, barring parliamentary accidents, four or five years. Then we all get to vote again. He\u2019ll remember when Churchill was voted out in favour of Attlee at the end of the war \u2013 I expect there were a few collywobbles about the taxing and spending that ensued back then but there wasn\u2019t another election until 1950.</p> <p>What is different this time? Broken manifesto promises? Don\u2019t make me laugh \u2013 they all do that. A manifesto is not a contract. The Tories spent the whole campaign screaming that Labour would raise taxes \u2013 they could not have made it clearer that no electoral promise is binding. Everyone who voted Labour was repeatedly informed of that fact. This prediction having now, to a certain extent, come to pass is no justification for ushering in a new system where each government has four months in which to institute utopia or it\u2019s out on its ear.</p> <p>And let\u2019s be clear: the government has not raised the taxes it specifically promised not to. No doubt it\u2019s been spendier and taxier than it implied, but much of its vast mandate was based on improving public services and that requires money. Not to do that would also have been a broken promise.</p> <p>So what was Caine thinking? Is it the irascibility of age that has made him less patient than he used to be when the lefties get in? I think the reason is more worrying. I think it\u2019s a product of polarisation in politics, of tribalism, of the demonisation of anyone who disagrees.

      "bodyText": "This week I was all geared up to slag off Rachel Reeves and now, thanks to Michael Caine, I can\u2019t. I hope you\u2019re happy, Michael. Is that what you wanted? To close down any centrist criticism of the government? Because that\u2019s what you\u2019ve done. Let me explain. Michael Caine, a great film star and an astute, relatable and popular public figure, has expressed his support for that petition for another general election. You know, the one that was set up a week or so ago by a pub owner from the Midlands and then got bigged up by Elon Musk. It accuses the government of having gone back on promises it made during the election campaign and, at the time of writing, it\u2019s got 2.8m signatures, one of them, presumably, Michael Caine\u2019s. Keir Starmer\u2019s response when asked about it was that it \u201cisn\u2019t how our system works\u201d and he is right. Michael Caine knows he\u2019s right. Michael Caine is 91. He\u2019s seen a fair few elections go against his wishes over the years and he understands, and has previously accepted, what then happens: the people he doesn\u2019t approve of get to have a proper go at governing for, barring parliamentary accidents, four or five years. Then we all get to vote again. He\u2019ll remember when Churchill was voted out in favour of Attlee at the end of the war \u2013 I expect there were a few collywobbles about the taxing and spending that ensued back then but there wasn\u2019t another election until 1950. What is different this time? Broken manifesto promises? Don\u2019t make me laugh \u2013 they all do that. A manifesto is not a contract. The Tories spent the whole campaign screaming that Labour would raise taxes \u2013 they could not have made it clearer that no electoral promise is binding. Everyone who voted Labour was repeatedly informed of that fact. This prediction having now, to a certain extent, come to pass is no justification for ushering in a new system where each government has four months in which to institute utopia or it\u2019s out on its ear. And let\u2019s be clear: the government has not raised the taxes it specifically promised not to. No doubt it\u2019s been spendier and taxier than it implied, but much of its vast mandate was based on improving public services and that requires money. Not to do that would also have been a broken promise. So what was Caine thinking? Is it the irascibility of age that has made him less patient than he used to be when the lefties get in? I think the reason is more worrying. I think it\u2019s a product of polarisation in politics, of tribalism, of the demonisation of anyone who disagrees. Caine has previously said that he usually votes Conservative and that he supported Brexit, though he once told the Guardian he\u2019d voted Labour on a couple of occasions. So he\u2019s not far right \u2013 he\u2019s not Reform. He was a fan of Thatcher but he probably thought Neil Kinnock had the right to exist. Yet, in the current climate, supporting the attempted removal of a government that so recently won a landslide victory feels like a reasonable thing for a Tory like him to do. In truth, it\u2019s a really extreme position and the huge support it seems to have quickly garnered is sinister. The involvement of Elon Musk, a foreign billionaire in control of an extremely influential social media platform, should send a shiver down any British patriot\u2019s spine. Musk is pointing millions of people towards this petition, and legitimising the notion that it\u2019s appropriate to remove a government for such a flimsy reason. It has the potential to be hugely destabilising, but that flatters the vanity of narcissistic \u201cdisruptors\u201d such as Musk. And he may be the least of its advocates. The petition has clothed itself in democratic colours by calling for an election, but in reality it undermines democracy because, taken to its logical conclusion, its approach makes democracy unworkable. That\u2019s what Russia and China want to happen; we would be naive to assume they haven\u2019t lent the petition their covert support. Under such circumstances, I too feel drawn to a more tribal position. When malign online forces are undermining a new progressive government\u2019s very right to exist, and getting support from mainstream figures such as Caine, it feels irresponsible to say anything negative about the chancellor of the exchequer. Currently that\u2019s incredibly frustrating. Am I supposed to pretend that I\u2019m OK with the fact that she lied on her CV, saying she\u2019d been an economist at Halifax Bank of Scotland when in fact she\u2019d worked in the retail arm?

Minstrels tune their musical instruments and soldiers sharpen their swords. Gloucester has just been captured by Prince Edward, and royal forces are growing in the west of England. The men come to me for yarrow to staunch their bleeding, comfrey to heal their injuries, and sulphur to soothe their sores. I smile at their faith in vinegar, a woman\u2019s touch and prayer. But secretly I long to be a lowly foot soldier, fighting with the men in the mud.</p> <p>Eventually, I summon the courage to pick up an axe and infiltrate their ranks. My presence on the battlefield is not as unlikely as it might sound. Some of us, such as Margaret of Beverley, fought. Only a little cross-dressing is required. I swap my ankle-length kirtle for a tunic, the wimple on my hair for a coif and helmet, and wrap my legs in woollen hose over large linen trousers. A knife hangs at my side. My femininity is hidden beneath a heavy protective gambeson or tunic. Its stitches are grubby and grey, as if the garment itself is sewn together with gristle. The thick padding absorbs the shock of a weapon, though sometimes a blade still slips through. At this point I drop my axe, clutch my chest and groan.

I had recently been released from Covid-19 quarantine and was excited to let off steam firing slingshots and wielding spears, especially after escaping into a newfound love of history during lockdown. I had taken up metal detecting and found treasure in the fields around my home, and often fell asleep listening to the soothing tones of Tony Robinson on <em>Time Team</em>. I was also excited to have found a new way to exercise, one more sociable and enticing than the gym treadmill. There was something magical about the energy of a crowd too, experienced at last in person instead of through a screen. My billowy costume let me move lightly between the moss-licked flagstones. Sometimes children grasped my sleeves, which caught me off guard. But it had been such a lonely summer that I was happy to be pulled to and fro.</p> <p>Re-enactors spread the word about their pastime through social media, trying in this digital age to keep history alive through performance, a concept that dates back at least to ancient Rome, when grand retellings of battles drew spectators to amphitheatres in their thousands. Yet performance is only half the tale. For me, historical re-enacting is a nourishing form of time-travel. Sometimes I flounce around my flat in a tunic and drink my coffee from an animal horn just for fun. I live history for history\u2019s sake and do not require an audience at all.</p> <p>I used to work as an editor in London before embracing a more earthy path, starting a PhD in nature poetry at Cambridge with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/22/robert-macfarlane-are-we-being-good-ancestors-mostly-no\">Robert Macfarlane</a>. Now, as a BBC New Generation Thinker 2024 (a group of 10 young arts and humanities researchers), I\u2019m writing a book and a Radio 3 essay on ancient connections between soil and self. It is the chance to strengthen these fraying connections that draws me to re-enacting most of all.</p>    <p>I was born into a family of Yorkshire farmers and grew up with their muddied tales. My mother hated being sent into the slaughterhouse or into the charred black night to fetch coal. But she loved stamping potato sacks, picking carrots or racing caterpillars up the stable door. These stories are seeded into my mind, even if they are not my own \u2013 the farm was sold before I was born. Still I feel a deep nostalgia for the fertile touch of soil, which I nourish through field and forest campouts. Re-enacting is my way of reclaiming a stolen birthright; a connection to earthy heritage that all humans share.</p> <p>I love the feeling as my feet push through muddy depths of time itself. Something in my brain shifts back a gear. </p> <p>Sometimes, I just want to chop wood and forage and sleep beneath the stars; this hobby lets me do this and more. Other re-enactors such as Gavin, a softly spoken lab technician from Soham in Cambridgeshire, are driven more by social connection. He used to be shy before gaining confidence, and friends by clinking horns around a hearth. Our group enjoys a raucous mead-fuelled feast each year.</p> <p>My friend Ben, a Yorkshire cabinet-maker who part-owns Nidhoggr Mead, a Viking honey wine company, believes the lure also lies in escapism. \u201cThe large numbers of people at events are good for battles but not so good for the immersive side,\u201d he says. \u201cI just want to play in the woods or a longhouse and pretend to live in a different time period.\u201d </p> <p>One week later, I\u2019m rolling up my tunic sleeves and speeding down the dual carriageway to set up a Viking camp in Wykeham forest in North Yorkshire. There will be no public there to be satisfied, simply the pleasure of living a little more closely with the earth. My authentic leather turnshoes \u2013 tanned with vegetables \u2013 don\u2019t have much grip and I\u2019m so excited to reach the camp that I keep slipping on wet leaves. I slow down when I see my fellow campers. They\u2019re pottering back through the centuries with more calm, proof if you needed it that re-enacting is an increasingly popular detox trend among burnt-out professionals.</p> <p>Ben, our chieftain, is laying out a fur rug. His partner Lizzie, an A&amp;E doctor, is peeling onions. A skateboarder called Corey is practising crossbow while Matt, a film studio owner, is sprawled out with a sore back. </p>    <p>My sense of time slows to match the mood. It meanders with the midges, a gentler kind of traffic than the morning rush. I loiter by the logs, nibbling discreetly on a piece of pizza hidden beneath my cloak. I know pizza is not authentic, but ambushes are hungry work. Soon I search for wood to fuel the fire. I peg down a tent, hang up a shield, and look for berries. We are too far into summer for my mission to be fruitful, but it\u2019s a good excuse to chase the last rays of a dying sun. <br></p> <p>The forest is dense. Twigs, leaves and insects tangle in my frizzy hair until I resemble a dreadful swamp creature. But I have meadow on my mind and foliage will not foil my plans. When I finally break through, fresh air fills my lungs. My heart is hushed by the long grass as I collapse to catch my breath. A tick hitches a ride on my naalbound socks, but otherwise I am delightfully alone. My senses tingle at the touch of soil.</p> <p>The smell of the bubbling cauldron summons me back to camp. We wait for the vegetables to soften; snapping twigs, giggling and gambling tokens on 10th-century wooden board games, the rules for which have barely changed. As the cold cuts through my cloak, I decide this isn\u2019t historical re-enacting at all. It\u2019s an extreme form of forest-bathing that promises much more than bites and bruises. It alters my perspective, allowing me to appreciate simple things \u2013 sun, sky and soil.</p> <p>Historical re-enacting is healing in other ways. I can shake the shackles of gender, race and class and slip into skins different to my own. It\u2019s a reclamation of power, though not everyone agrees. There\u2019s always debate about the authenticity of historical TV dramas and films. Look at the uproar that greeted Ridley Scott daring to \u201clob a few sharks\u201d into the Colosseum in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/17/gladiator-ii-review-paul-mescal-denzel-washington-ridley-scott-formulaic-sequel\">Gladiator II</a></em>, and the mixed Black female actor Caroline Henderson playing a leader in Netflix\u2019s <em>Vikings: Valhalla</em><em>.</em> As a mixed Black female re-enactor in a sea of men with beards, I\u2019m not always fully authentic myself either. It\u2019s a struggle to squeeze my afro hair beneath a coif, wimple or helmet, unless I tame the fuzzy strands into tiny plaits first. The costumes are not always made for people like me. But the groups I\u2019m part of encourage me to explore a range of roles. We are 21st-century organisations based on modern values.</p>    <p>One authenticity officer assures me that \u201chistory belongs to everyone\u201d and is more diverse than people realise. While some ethnic groups were excluded from certain roles, the bustling trade routes between Europe, Africa, and the Middle East encourage us to explore the possible, if not always documented, wealth of interactions and cultural exchanges that might have taken place. It is widely accepted that Vikings reached North Africa in about 859, for example; a largely forgotten chapter in history that inspired the historical novel I\u2019m writing about what it was like to be dark in the dark ages and where early enslaved people found light. More than 100,000 Islamic silver coins have been found in Viking-age Scandinavia along with rings and clothes that some historians believe bear inscriptions to Allah. Even on our own shores, Black historical figures such as Saint Hadrian of Canterbury have played a pivotal&nbsp;role.</p> <p>While bending history too far is problematic, especially for entertainment, my love of re-enacting is rooted in keeping history alive. This might be surprising given that I dropped history at school and did not sit an exam in the subject. The greatest lesson I learned came many years later, while practising my axe-fighting skills in a field with my new Viking friends. Despite what teachers say, no textbook can bring history to life as simply living it&nbsp;can.</p>",

My friend Ben, a Yorkshire cabinet-maker who part-owns Nidhoggr Mead, a Viking honey wine company, believes the lure also lies in escapism. \u201cThe large numbers of people at events are good for battles but not so good for the immersive side,\u201d he says. \u201cI just want to play in the woods or a longhouse and pretend to live in a different time period.\u201d One week later, I\u2019m rolling up my tunic sleeves and speeding down the dual carriageway to set up a Viking camp in Wykeham forest in North Yorkshire. There will be no public there to be satisfied, simply the pleasure of living a little more closely with the earth. My authentic leather turnshoes \u2013 tanned with vegetables \u2013 don\u2019t have much grip and I\u2019m so excited to reach the camp that I keep slipping on wet leaves. I slow down when I see my fellow campers. They\u2019re pottering back through the centuries with more calm, proof if you needed it that re-enacting is an increasingly popular detox trend among burnt-out professionals. Ben, our chieftain, is laying out a fur rug. His partner Lizzie, an A&amp;E doctor, is peeling onions. A skateboarder called Corey is practising crossbow while Matt, a film studio owner, is sprawled out with a sore back. My sense of time slows to match the mood. It meanders with the midges, a gentler kind of traffic than the morning rush. I loiter by the logs, nibbling discreetly on a piece of pizza hidden beneath my cloak. I know pizza is not authentic, but ambushes are hungry work. Soon I search for wood to fuel the fire. I peg down a tent, hang up a shield, and look for berries. We are too far into summer for my mission to be fruitful, but it\u2019s a good excuse to chase the last rays of a dying sun. The forest is dense. Twigs, leaves and insects tangle in my frizzy hair until I resemble a dreadful swamp creature. But I have meadow on my mind and foliage will not foil my plans. When I finally break through, fresh air fills my lungs. My heart is hushed by the long grass as I collapse to catch my breath. A tick hitches a ride on my naalbound socks, but otherwise I am delightfully alone. My senses tingle at the touch of soil. The smell of the bubbling cauldron summons me back to camp. We wait for the vegetables to soften; snapping twigs, giggling and gambling tokens on 10th-century wooden board games, the rules for which have barely changed. As the cold cuts through my cloak, I decide this isn\u2019t historical re-enacting at all. It\u2019s an extreme form of forest-bathing that promises much more than bites and bruises. It alters my perspective, allowing me to appreciate simple things \u2013 sun, sky and soil. Historical re-enacting is healing in other ways. I can shake the shackles of gender, race and class and slip into skins different to my own. It\u2019s a reclamation of power, though not everyone agrees. There\u2019s always debate about the authenticity of historical TV dramas and films. Look at the uproar that greeted Ridley Scott daring to \u201clob a few sharks\u201d into the Colosseum in Gladiator II, and the mixed Black female actor Caroline Henderson playing a leader in Netflix\u2019s Vikings: Valhalla. As a mixed Black female re-enactor in a sea of men with beards, I\u2019m not always fully authentic myself either. It\u2019s a struggle to squeeze my afro hair beneath a coif, wimple or helmet, unless I tame the fuzzy strands into tiny plaits first. The costumes are not always made for people like me. But the groups I\u2019m part of encourage me to explore a range of roles. We are 21st-century organisations based on modern values. One authenticity officer assures me that \u201chistory belongs to everyone\u201d and is more diverse than people realise. While some ethnic groups were excluded from certain roles, the bustling trade routes between Europe, Africa, and the Middle East encourage us to explore the possible, if not always documented, wealth of interactions and cultural exchanges that might have taken place. It is widely accepted that Vikings reached North Africa in about 859, for example; a largely forgotten chapter in history that inspired the historical novel I\u2019m writing about what it was like to be dark in the dark ages and where early enslaved people found light. More than 100,000 Islamic silver coins have been found in Viking-age Scandinavia along with rings and clothes that some historians believe bear inscriptions to Allah. Even on our own shores, Black historical figures such as Saint Hadrian of Canterbury have played a pivotal role. While bending history too far is problematic, especially for entertainment, my love of re-enacting is rooted in keeping history alive. This might be surprising given that I dropped history at school and did not sit an exam in the subject. The greatest lesson I learned came many years later, while practising my axe-fighting skills in a field with my new Viking friends. Despite what teachers say, no textbook can bring history to life as simply living it can.",

Georgescu\u2019s unexpected success, after a campaign that he said had zero financing and that was based heavily on viral TikTok videos reportedly boosted by bot-like activity, has triggered nightly protests and aroused suspicions of external interference. Romania\u2019s top court ordered a recount and on Monday it is due to announce its decision on a request by a defeated candidate to annul the vote over allegations of illegal electoral activity on behalf of the second-placed candidate, Elena Lasconi.

      "body": "<p>Bassist Alex James, along with Damon Albarn, Graham Coxon and Dave Rowntree, formed Blur in 1988. In 2023, Blur brought out their ninth studio album, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/22/blur-the-ballad-of-darren-review-mature-melancholia-spiked-with-adventure-the-narcissist\">The Ballad of Darren</a></em>, and played two sold-out nights at Wembley Stadium. Alex started making cheese in 2003, and hosts an annual food and music event, the Big Feastival, on his farm in the Cotswolds. He is married to Claire Neate and has five children \u2013 Geronimo, twins Artemis and Gallileo, Sable and Beatrix. His book, <em>Over the Rainbow</em>, is his account of Blur\u2019s reformation and tour in 2023.</p> <p><strong>Why </strong><em><strong>Over the Rainbow</strong></em><strong>?<br></strong>I just think there was a proper sense of enchantment with Blur getting back together. It was magical. But it started with me cacking it on the M40 on the way into London for that first meeting with the band, to see if we could do it\u2026 four stone overweight, and just thinking: \u201cWhat band doesn\u2019t hate one another at this point?\u201d</p> <p><strong>But it worked.<br></strong>With bands, it\u2019s either completely impossible or completely effortless. And going to the gym to get into my Britpop trousers was hard, the travelling was hard, keeping Feastival going was hard. But actually playing the bass with Blur, it was like riding a bike downhill, purely joyous.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Geek out, freak out. That\u2019s the magic formula for running a festival</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>You lost four stone through eating broth and working out every day. Did you never think of doing the weight-loss jab?<br></strong>No. The great thing about going to the gym is it is horrible, but it works. When you\u2019re running a festival, you never know whether it\u2019s going to work. You know: Kelis turned up, didn\u2019t do Milkshake. Natalie Imbruglia is there but her band didn\u2019t turn up. It might rain. Did you see those tents going off in a whirlwind at Leeds this year? Terrible. Whatever you do, you can\u2019t actually guarantee that a festival is going to work. But when it comes to the gym, when you are doing your 100th burpee, you know that it\u2019s fucking working.</p> <p><strong>Let\u2019s talk Feastival. It\u2019s clear from the book that it takes up a lot of your time, even while you\u2019re touring with Blur. It\u2019s also clear that you love it, especially the cheese </strong><strong>hub. What is the cheese hub?<br></strong>It\u2019s our party within the party of Feastival, the world\u2019s stupidest nightclub that\u2019s open three days a year. There\u2019s food and music and geekery. Professors get a free pass: you can get a world expert in anything for much less hassle than a B-list celebrity. What I\u2019ve learned from running a festival is it\u2019s brilliant if you can teach people something in the daytime, and then let them forget everything in the evening. Geek out, freak out. That\u2019s the magic formula.</p>    <p><strong>Would you say that your personality leans towards having a good time?<br></strong>Hopefully, yes. My dad was a thoroughly contented soul.

      "bodyText": "Bassist Alex James, along with Damon Albarn, Graham Coxon and Dave Rowntree, formed Blur in 1988. In 2023, Blur brought out their ninth studio album, The Ballad of Darren, and played two sold-out nights at Wembley Stadium. Alex started making cheese in 2003, and hosts an annual food and music event, the Big Feastival, on his farm in the Cotswolds. He is married to Claire Neate and has five children \u2013 Geronimo, twins Artemis and Gallileo, Sable and Beatrix. His book, Over the Rainbow, is his account of Blur\u2019s reformation and tour in 2023. Why Over the Rainbow? I just think there was a proper sense of enchantment with Blur getting back together. It was magical. But it started with me cacking it on the M40 on the way into London for that first meeting with the band, to see if we could do it\u2026 four stone overweight, and just thinking: \u201cWhat band doesn\u2019t hate one another at this point?\u201d But it worked. With bands, it\u2019s either completely impossible or completely effortless. And going to the gym to get into my Britpop trousers was hard, the travelling was hard, keeping Feastival going was hard. But actually playing the bass with Blur, it was like riding a bike downhill, purely joyous. You lost four stone through eating broth and working out every day. Did you never think of doing the weight-loss jab? No. The great thing about going to the gym is it is horrible, but it works. When you\u2019re running a festival, you never know whether it\u2019s going to work. You know: Kelis turned up, didn\u2019t do Milkshake. Natalie Imbruglia is there but her band didn\u2019t turn up. It might rain. Did you see those tents going off in a whirlwind at Leeds this year? Terrible. Whatever you do, you can\u2019t actually guarantee that a festival is going to work. But when it comes to the gym, when you are doing your 100th burpee, you know that it\u2019s fucking working. Let\u2019s talk Feastival. It\u2019s clear from the book that it takes up a lot of your time, even while you\u2019re touring with Blur. It\u2019s also clear that you love it, especially the cheese hub. What is the cheese hub? It\u2019s our party within the party of Feastival, the world\u2019s stupidest nightclub that\u2019s open three days a year. There\u2019s food and music and geekery. Professors get a free pass: you can get a world expert in anything for much less hassle than a B-list celebrity. What I\u2019ve learned from running a festival is it\u2019s brilliant if you can teach people something in the daytime, and then let them forget everything in the evening. Geek out, freak out. That\u2019s the magic formula. Would you say that your personality leans towards having a good time? Hopefully, yes. My dad was a thoroughly contented soul. He was evacuated to Wales when he was a kid and had a younger sibling who died. An incredibly challenging childhood, but he always saw the bright side in everything. I grew up in sunny Bournemouth, and Graham Coxon was the first person I saw when I arrived in London. I\u2019ve been blessed. It\u2019s a gift. I\u2019ve always thought that Graham plays against you in Blur\u2019s music. If you think of Girls and Boys, you\u2019re doing a disco bassline and his guitar is angular noise.

      "body": "<p>Christmas dinner is taken <em>very</em> seriously in my family, and is more or less the highlight of the entire holidays. I start cooking two days ahead \u2013 making stock for gravy, prepping the vegetables and making a start on the pudding, which is always cold rice pudding \u2013 all while people are coming and going, peeking into pots and tasting, enjoying the smells of Christmas and drinking port, and often with a Christmas movie playing in the background. That all leads up to the centrepiece of our Christmas meal, the duck, which I take out of the fridge on the morning of the 24th and get ready for the oven. I serve it with red cabbage, kale salad, classic caramel potatoes and a nice gravy, but it\u2019s the crisp, sweet and tender roast duck that binds the entire meal together. </p> <h2>Roast duck, Danish-style</h2> <p>Prep <strong>10 min<br></strong>Cook <strong>1 hr 40 min+<br></strong>Rest<strong> 10 min<br></strong>Serves <strong>4</strong><strong>-5</strong></p> <p><strong>1 duck</strong>, about 2\u00bd-3kg, ideally with giblets</p> <p>For the stuffing<br><strong>1 beetroot</strong>, peeled<br><strong>1 cox\u2019s orange pippin apple</strong>, or similar<br><strong>1 red onion</strong>, peeled<strong><br>1 tsp coriander seeds<br>1 tsp allspice<br>3 cloves<br>4 prunes<br>10 thyme sprigs<br>2 bay leaves<br>Sea salt and </strong><strong>black pepper</strong></p> <p>Remove the giblets from inside the duck and set aside; if there is a lot of fat in the cavity, take some of it out and save it to melt for roast potatoes.</p> <p>Next, make the stuffing. Cut the beetroot, apple and onion into 2cm wedges and coarsely grind the spices, then mix all the stuffing ingredients in a bowl and season. Push the stuffing mixture into the duck\u2019s cavity, pressing it in so everything gets in there, then close up the duck with meat needles and rub the outside with more salt and pepper.</p> <p>Heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)/325F/gas 3.

      "bodyText": "Christmas dinner is taken very seriously in my family, and is more or less the highlight of the entire holidays. I start cooking two days ahead \u2013 making stock for gravy, prepping the vegetables and making a start on the pudding, which is always cold rice pudding \u2013 all while people are coming and going, peeking into pots and tasting, enjoying the smells of Christmas and drinking port, and often with a Christmas movie playing in the background. That all leads up to the centrepiece of our Christmas meal, the duck, which I take out of the fridge on the morning of the 24th and get ready for the oven. I serve it with red cabbage, kale salad, classic caramel potatoes and a nice gravy, but it\u2019s the crisp, sweet and tender roast duck that binds the entire meal together. Roast duck, Danish-style Prep 10 min Cook 1 hr 40 min+ Rest 10 min Serves 4-5 1 duck, about 2\u00bd-3kg, ideally with giblets For the stuffing 1 beetroot, peeled 1 cox\u2019s orange pippin apple, or similar 1 red onion, peeled 1 tsp coriander seeds 1 tsp allspice 3 cloves 4 prunes 10 thyme sprigs 2 bay leaves Sea salt and black pepper Remove the giblets from inside the duck and set aside; if there is a lot of fat in the cavity, take some of it out and save it to melt for roast potatoes. Next, make the stuffing. Cut the beetroot, apple and onion into 2cm wedges and coarsely grind the spices, then mix all the stuffing ingredients in a bowl and season. Push the stuffing mixture into the duck\u2019s cavity, pressing it in so everything gets in there, then close up the duck with meat needles and rub the outside with more salt and pepper. Heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)/325F/gas 3. The roasting time for the duck is 40 minutes per kilo, turning up the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 for the last 20 minutes. Lay the duck breast side down on a wire rack set over a roasting tin, then pour 500ml water into the tin and roast for an hour. Turn the duck around, so it\u2019s now sitting breast side up, and make sure there is liquid in the roasting tin all the time. If you like, add the giblets to the juices in the roasting tin for the last 30 minutes of roasting time (or add only the heart and kidneys, and fry the liver in a little butter, season well and eat on toast for a cook\u2019s treat). After the duck has roasted for its allotted time, use a meat thermometer to check the temperature where the meat meets the bone at the thighs \u2013 it should be 68C. If it is, take out the duck and leave to rest for 10 minutes; otherwise, roast it for another five or 10 minutes. Lift out and discard the giblets, if using, from the roasting tin \u2013 they have now served their purpose \u2013 then separate the fat from the juices in the tin, and save it for roasting potatoes, for adding to your red cabbage, or keep it in the fridge for another day.

      "body": "<p>There is a work in <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/electric-dreams?gad_source=1\">this enthralling show</a> to make you blink and look twice. It\u2019s by the madcap Belgian Pol Bury. On the wall is a large wooden oval sprouting hundreds of fine bristles (think of an enormous hairbrush). Your eyes move over its surface, thoughts perhaps pressing forwards, given the many rooms to go. All of a sudden there is a fractional twitch, somewhere among the thicket, imperceptible as a synaptic leap. It\u2019s as if the sculpture had a mind of its own.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/bury-3069-white-dots-on-an-oval-background-t00918\">3069 White Dots on an Oval Background</a></em> \u2013 deadpan title \u2013 fulfils Bury\u2019s 60s dream of finding the midpoint between motion and non-motion with little more than imagination and a primitive motor. It is one of so many works in this teeming, beeping, flickering, pulsating exhibition of art (dating from roughly 1950 to the 90s) that just cannot keep still. Wonderful contraptions, often involving no more than tin cans and electricity, wobble and vibrate. Screens shudder with static. Black-and-white <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/o/op-art\">op art paintings</a> revolve like the spiralling credits to Hitchcock\u2019s <em>Vertigo</em>.</p>    <p>The technology of the subtitle runs all the way from simple electricity to prisms and electromagnets, early computers to the first touch-screen devices. Helpful wall guides explain all sorts of science, from alpha waves to <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/history/fortran\">Fortran</a> (the first computer language standard) to cybernetics. The ideal art show for anyone interested in science, it is also unexpectedly moving in a quite different way: a poignant and often beautiful vision of human creativity engaging with machines.</p> <p>Initially, quite a lot of what you see has no technological underpinning at all. Vera Spencer\u2019s collage of coloured punched cards, used in mechanical looms to create complex patterns, makes a semi-abstract skyline of high buildings at night. German artist G\u00fcnther Uecker\u2019s densely hammered <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/gunther-uecker-2083\">board of white nails</a> seems to shimmer like a windblown wheatfield as you move. By far the most eye-popping exhibit of all is French artist Fran\u00e7ois Morellet\u2019s stupendous corridor of blue and red squares gyrating against each other, and setting off explosions of after-images in your optical field. Its patterns were randomly generated according to the odd and even numbers of a telephone directory.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Glades of strobe-lit steel rods vibrate and shudder when passing visitors shout out or clap</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Pixellated glass panels; mobiles that shift when you blow upon on them; poet-performer-visionary <a href=\"https://www.thewhitereview.org/feature/the-idea-machine-brion-gysin/\">Brion Gysin</a> famously announcing (you listen on headphones) that words do not belong to <em>anyone</em>, and explaining how he pioneered cut-ups with William Burroughs in the 1950s. The buildup to the space-and-data age is pure nostalgia, before the electricity really fires in.</p> <p>Blue rays dart and twinkle across black screens. Iron filings flitter through revolving wheels. The Italian kinetic artist Alberto Biasi refracts beams of light from shifting angles through crystal prisms to create ever-changing rainbows. Chinese-American cybernetic sculptor <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/wen-ying-tsai-2071\">Wen-Ying Tsai</a> installs glades of strobe-lit steel rods that vibrate and shudder when passing visitors shout out or clap.</p>    <p>With 15 sections, it\u2019s a crowded show. But the pacing is subtle, with ideal pauses for solo artists. A recreation of Venezuelan artist <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fma9IV8ojug&amp;t=20s\">Carlos Cruz-Diez</a>\u2019s 1974 immersive installation <em>Chromointerferent Environment</em> fills an entire gallery with parallel lines of light that ripple over each other like perpetual cross-tides, constantly changing the appearance of people and drifting balloons in the room. Japanese artist <a href=\"https://tatsuomiyajima.com/\">Tatsuo Miyajima</a> uses glowing rings of red and green LED numbers, programmed to move from one to 99 in unique and alternating combinations, to produce what is effectively a Buddhist installation based upon the principle of endless continuity and never-ending change.</p> <p>And the marvellous American artist <a href=\"https://www.lilianelijn.com/\">Liliane Lijn</a>, now 84, and one of the show\u2019s true stars, has early and late works on show. Best of all is a gorgeous miniature theatre \u2013 as it seems \u2013 of silver metal curtains across which lights flicker in random patterns, like voiceless and invisible actors.</p> <p>Internationalism is a curatorial principle here, so that one learns a lot about the boffin-artists who converged on Zagreb\u2019s Gallery of Contemporary Art in 1960, or at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity in Canada from 1990. The <a href=\"https://lifa-research.org/en/artists/grav/\">Grav group</a>, founded in Paris in 1960, were inspired by mathematical principles and pre-determined systems. How dry that sounds, until you enter Morellet\u2019s blazing red-blue corridor (the good old technology, incidentally, of colour).</p>    <p>Later rooms are purely archival, as with too many Tate shows of recent years: research materials laid out in prim vitrines. And here and there the art resembles period cocktail bar decor, the aesthetic shifting from James Bond to psychedelic lava lamp. But mostly these artists were really trying to harness technology to blow your mind.</p> <p>There is a hilariously solemn sequence from BBC Two\u2019s <em>Late Night Line-Up</em>, in 1968, announcing all sorts of computer-generated art that has been diligently rediscovered by the show\u2019s curators. Choreography, atonal music, a tragicomic computer-generated Mondrian that looks designed by a child, and had to be coloured in by a painter.</p> <p>Among them is the head of a robot called <em>SAM (Sound Activated Mobile)</em> created by the Polish artist <a href=\"http://www.kinetica-artfair.com/?exhibitors/2010/edward-ihnatowicz\">Edward Ihnatowicz</a>. It is a most affecting fragment \u2013 a propeller head with a powerful force of personality \u2013 that used to be attached to a body that interacted with visitors.

      "bodyText": "There is a work in this enthralling show to make you blink and look twice. It\u2019s by the madcap Belgian Pol Bury. On the wall is a large wooden oval sprouting hundreds of fine bristles (think of an enormous hairbrush). Your eyes move over its surface, thoughts perhaps pressing forwards, given the many rooms to go. All of a sudden there is a fractional twitch, somewhere among the thicket, imperceptible as a synaptic leap. It\u2019s as if the sculpture had a mind of its own. 3069 White Dots on an Oval Background \u2013 deadpan title \u2013 fulfils Bury\u2019s 60s dream of finding the midpoint between motion and non-motion with little more than imagination and a primitive motor. It is one of so many works in this teeming, beeping, flickering, pulsating exhibition of art (dating from roughly 1950 to the 90s) that just cannot keep still. Wonderful contraptions, often involving no more than tin cans and electricity, wobble and vibrate. Screens shudder with static. Black-and-white op art paintings revolve like the spiralling credits to Hitchcock\u2019s Vertigo. The technology of the subtitle runs all the way from simple electricity to prisms and electromagnets, early computers to the first touch-screen devices. Helpful wall guides explain all sorts of science, from alpha waves to Fortran (the first computer language standard) to cybernetics. The ideal art show for anyone interested in science, it is also unexpectedly moving in a quite different way: a poignant and often beautiful vision of human creativity engaging with machines. Initially, quite a lot of what you see has no technological underpinning at all. Vera Spencer\u2019s collage of coloured punched cards, used in mechanical looms to create complex patterns, makes a semi-abstract skyline of high buildings at night. German artist G\u00fcnther Uecker\u2019s densely hammered board of white nails seems to shimmer like a windblown wheatfield as you move. By far the most eye-popping exhibit of all is French artist Fran\u00e7ois Morellet\u2019s stupendous corridor of blue and red squares gyrating against each other, and setting off explosions of after-images in your optical field. Its patterns were randomly generated according to the odd and even numbers of a telephone directory. Pixellated glass panels; mobiles that shift when you blow upon on them; poet-performer-visionary Brion Gysin famously announcing (you listen on headphones) that words do not belong to anyone, and explaining how he pioneered cut-ups with William Burroughs in the 1950s. The buildup to the space-and-data age is pure nostalgia, before the electricity really fires in. Blue rays dart and twinkle across black screens. Iron filings flitter through revolving wheels. The Italian kinetic artist Alberto Biasi refracts beams of light from shifting angles through crystal prisms to create ever-changing rainbows. Chinese-American cybernetic sculptor Wen-Ying Tsai installs glades of strobe-lit steel rods that vibrate and shudder when passing visitors shout out or clap. With 15 sections, it\u2019s a crowded show. But the pacing is subtle, with ideal pauses for solo artists. A recreation of Venezuelan artist Carlos Cruz-Diez\u2019s 1974 immersive installation Chromointerferent Environment fills an entire gallery with parallel lines of light that ripple over each other like perpetual cross-tides, constantly changing the appearance of people and drifting balloons in the room. Japanese artist Tatsuo Miyajima uses glowing rings of red and green LED numbers, programmed to move from one to 99 in unique and alternating combinations, to produce what is effectively a Buddhist installation based upon the principle of endless continuity and never-ending change. And the marvellous American artist Liliane Lijn, now 84, and one of the show\u2019s true stars, has early and late works on show. Best of all is a gorgeous miniature theatre \u2013 as it seems \u2013 of silver metal curtains across which lights flicker in random patterns, like voiceless and invisible actors. Internationalism is a curatorial principle here, so that one learns a lot about the boffin-artists who converged on Zagreb\u2019s Gallery of Contemporary Art in 1960, or at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity in Canada from 1990. The Grav group, founded in Paris in 1960, were inspired by mathematical principles and pre-determined systems. How dry that sounds, until you enter Morellet\u2019s blazing red-blue corridor (the good old technology, incidentally, of colour). Later rooms are purely archival, as with too many Tate shows of recent years: research materials laid out in prim vitrines. And here and there the art resembles period cocktail bar decor, the aesthetic shifting from James Bond to psychedelic lava lamp. But mostly these artists were really trying to harness technology to blow your mind. There is a hilariously solemn sequence from BBC Two\u2019s Late Night Line-Up, in 1968, announcing all sorts of computer-generated art that has been diligently rediscovered by the show\u2019s curators. Choreography, atonal music, a tragicomic computer-generated Mondrian that looks designed by a child, and had to be coloured in by a painter. Among them is the head of a robot called SAM (Sound Activated Mobile) created by the Polish artist Edward Ihnatowicz. It is a most affecting fragment \u2013 a propeller head with a powerful force of personality \u2013 that used to be attached to a body that interacted with visitors. You can see historic footage on a nearby screen. Now it stands forlorn, in its case, the relic of a long-ago idea. For the technology is long since surpassed \u2013 and effectively dead. A faint worry that the show should still seem relevant is raised in the catalogue to Electric Dreams. Given the dross so far produced by AI, the curators need not fear. The art in this show is innocent, idealistic, absorbing and highly intelligent. It is both charmingly archaic and constantly prophetic.

Or, should I say: weight. \u201cDo you feel lighter?\u201d a friend asked me a week after I had a total colectomy to save my life. To which I replied (somewhat contradictorily): yes and no.

My trip to the GP, only six months earlier, had been precipitated by a few throbbing aches in my feet and some mild fatigue. A routine referral to check my iron levels led to a diagnosis of anaemia which, in turn, led me to my toilet at home with a faecal test. Only a year earlier, I\u2019d read the words of NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard urging us as a nation \u201cnot to be prudish about poo\u201d in light of the startling fact that bowel cancer is now the fourth most common cancer in the UK. And yet I didn\u2019t think this plea related to me as a 40-year-old woman. I didn\u2019t even think this test was necessary. Until my GP rang me 24 hours later, in a calm yet brittle voice that I had got to know only too well over the six-year obstacle course of my late husband\u2019s brain tumour. I had been prudish.

Our bodily functions don\u2019t always make for neat prose. My diagnosis doesn\u2019t exactly make for a neat story. Although the number of under-50s being diagnosed with colorectal cancer has seen a dramatic uptick, an increase of nearly 80% over the last three decades \u2013 an alarming trend that experts are still researching as to the cause \u2013 my own cause for intestinal concern, confirmed by genetic testing last year, was an unusual one. Familial adenomatous polyposis is a rare hereditary syndrome, caused by a defect in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene, a tumour suppressor gene, that raises the risk of developing colorectal cancer to nearly 100%.

Forty polyps in the rectum may seem stark when compared with the few small growths many people develop in older age. But with all of mine at less than a centimetre I could, according to my medical team, adopt one of two approaches: remove both organs simultaneously (undergoing something called an ileostomy) or keep my rectum for now and thus postpone the need for a stoma bag \u2013 with regular surveillance.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t prepare us for these choices at school, do they?\u201d a friend quipped as I began sharing my news. The pressure to make such a life-affecting decision with no medical experience felt almost gravitational with its drag and pull. It\u2019s a forcefield that also yanked me unexpectedly backwards into my past. I\u2019d had cancer before, a rare type of cancer that affects the thyroid gland, when I was 19. How jarring that this recent diagnosis should explain that summer I spent on a radioactive ward feeling othered by a disease that couldn\u2019t be accounted for. Only now it felt loaded with a new surgical quandary that I alone could answer. Should the rectum stay or go?</p> <p>I oscillated between both poles, but my instinct kept telling me to hold back. Was I being reckless in saying I wanted to give my body a chance? Worse still: naive? During one consultation, my surgeon, presuming the reasons for my apprehension, showed me pictures of younger women baring their stoma bags in their swimwear. \u201cNo one will see it,\u201d he assured me. And while I could appreciate that his assumption was based on many a woman\u2019s legitimate concerns, a little voice inside of me wanted to reply, <em>but</em> <em>I will see it. </em>Because this wasn\u2019t about an external gaze. It wasn\u2019t about swimwear, either. It was about the precious connection I had with my body. A connection that now felt painfully disjointed. Something inside of me had gone horribly wrong (again) and in the absence of any control over these mushrooming adenomas, I felt fiercely protective of whatever autonomy I still had left.</p> <p>\u201cMy husband died of brain cancer,\u201d I blurted out to a nurse practitioner about 10 minutes after I had made the decision to keep my rectum. At the time I regretted saying these words. I felt embarrassed, even. As if I\u2019d shared too much of myself and made things more overwrought than they needed to be. What relevance did this chapter in my story have in this room? What was I expecting this nurse to say in return? It would take me a little while longer to recognise the correlation between these two traumatic junctures in my life. That the loss of an organ is, in fact, another kind of grief. In my case, a large incision upon an ever-deep and still-repairing wound. \u201cYou\u2019ll grieve losing a part of you,\u201d my friend texted me in the wake of my colectomy \u2013 a friend who, only years previously, had undergone an equally lifesaving hysterectomy. At the time of reading her words, this emptiness felt almost physically heavy in its shape and form. Until I realised, and not for the first time, that all grief is a surrendering of sorts, a relinquishing to something far greater than yourself.</p> <p>And yet relinquishing to that greater thing hasn\u2019t disenfranchised me as a result. If anything, it\u2019s made me hold ever more tightly on to the choices I have. Twenty years after my cancer diagnosis, and six years since the death of my husband, this latest health scare has helped me to understand what autonomy actually means when your body becomes a site of complication. We are all passengers of our own physicality, and sometimes that physicality dictates the terms, but that doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t small gains to be made in the thicket of injury. The neurologist Oliver Sacks called the limbo one finds oneself in sickness \u201cthe night-womb\u201d before a new life has been created.

I don\u2019t know what the future holds and I may still need a stoma bag in the years that follow. But somewhere in the uncertainty of what comes next, I have found a sureness that feels just as potent. Yes, my body has failed me. But in spite of the odds, it has saved me too.",

      "body": "<p>For many years, I used to give an annual lecture to theology students training to be Anglican priests at Trinity College, Bristol, on \u201c<a href=\"https://kenanmalik.com/2012/02/06/who-needs-god/\">Why I am an atheist</a>\u201d. One perennial response from the students was that \u201cwithout belief in God, atheists can simply pick and choose which values to accept and which to reject\u201d.</p> <p>To which I would reply: \u201cYes, that\u2019s true, though we don\u2019t pick and choose values simply as individuals, or as we might pick and choose a shirt or a car, but rather as part of communities, societies, cultures, histories and traditions, and in accordance with our foundational beliefs.\u201d But, I would add, \u201cyou as believers have to pick and choose your values, too\u201d.</p> <p>In the past, thousands of witches were burned and millions of people enslaved because it was believed that God had sanctified such practices. Today, virtually no Christian thinks that. The shift has come about not because God has changed his mind but because humans have. As societies develop, so moral values change. As social attitudes to slavery and witch-burnings transformed, so Christians came to interpret the Bible differently \u2013 which is another way of saying that they chose different values as making more sense within their religious perspective.</p> <p>Today, some Christians, reading passages in Leviticus and in Paul, think that the Bible justifies the execution of gay people. Others, reading the same Bible differently, celebrate the ordination of gay priests. Similarly with controversies from abortion rights to the treatment of asylum seekers. Each side reads the Bible as they wish to fit into their own moral framework. God is not the designer of that framework but comes to be its justification. And what is true of Christians is true also of Muslims, Jews, Hindus and believers in every other faith.</p> <p>I was reminded of those students as the row developed last week over justice secretary\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shabana-mahmood\">Shabana Mahmood</a>\u2019s opposition to Kim Leadbeater\u2019s assisted dying bill and the former lord chancellor Lord Falconer\u2019s curt dismissal of it. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/shabana-mahmood-interview-first-time-i-was-racially-abused-i-was-7-x9068s6qx\">As a Muslim</a>, I have an unshakeable belief in the sanctity and the value of human life\u201d, Mahmood had told the <em>Times</em> in October, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t think that death is a service that the state should be offering.\u201d Those sentiments returned to the headlines after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/23/uk-justice-secretary-attacks-assisted-dying-bill-as-state-death-service\">letter she wrote to her constituents</a>, expressing her opposition to the proposed law, was made public. \u201cI respect\u2026 [the] religious and spiritual reasons why she believes completely in the sanctity of life,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/24/shabana-mahmood-should-not-impose-her-religious-beliefs-on-others-says-peer\">Falconer told Sky News</a>. \u201cBut I do not think it should be imposed on everybody else.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday, parliament gave a second reading to Leadbeater\u2019s bill, beginning the process of turning it into law. Falconer\u2019s comments, though, and the debate around them, were directed not simply at this particular debate but expressed a deeper unease about the role of religion in public life and the boundaries of a secular society.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The same God can speak to many moral perspectives</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For many of its advocates, secularism requires religion to be excluded from the public sphere and from political debate. This, ironically, is an understanding of secularism not so different from that of the theology students, though viewed from the opposite end of the telescope. The trainee priests worried about secularism because they feared religion might lose its public voice. And what Falconer feared, they insisted was true: that their faith determined their moral and political views.</p> <p>The reality is more complicated. Certainly, the \u201cas a\u201d prefix to an argument (\u201cas a Muslim\u201d, \u201cas a Jew\u201d, \u201cas a woman\u201d, \u201cas a white American\u201d, I believe that\u2026) is one of the abominations of contemporary politics. Not only does it shut off debate by insisting that one\u2019s identity or faith defines the limits of one\u2019s views, it also suggests that Muslims, Jews, women, white Americans and every other identity group have, or should have, a particular set of values by virtue of their identity, a crass and reactionary sentiment.</p> <p>Insisting that God mandates particular political and moral views, and so makes them unchallengeable, is equally to close off political debate and to ignore the variety of perspectives within any faith. Yet, as I suggested to my theology students, rather than their faith determining their values and politics, it is often the case that their moral and political outlook shape how they interpret religious texts or what they imagine to be God\u2019s will. We can see this in the debate over assisted dying itself. Mahmood, a Muslim, opposed the bill, as did many Christians and Jews and Buddhists and Hindus.</p> <p>But many believers\u2013 <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/mps-dignity-in-dying-england-helen-whately-westminster-b2418785.html\">possibly the majority</a> according to some polls \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.moreincommon.org.uk/media/jrko2fog/proceeding-with-caution.pdf\">disagree</a>, even if they are more likely to oppose the measure than those who are not religious. The same God can speak to many moral perspectives. Mahmood is wrong to suggest that \u201cas a Muslim\u201d she can hold only one view on this or any other debate. Falconer is wrong to suggest that for Mahmood to express her faith-based view in a democratic debate is to \u201cimpose it on everyone else\u201d.</p> <p>Secularism is not a space from which religion must be excluded but one in which the state neither affirms nor denies any religion, and so one in which no religion is granted privilege over any another, nor over any secular philosophy or ideology. A truly secular Britain would have no established church, no state-funded religious schools and no blasphemy laws.</p> <p>Last Wednesday, during PMQs, Birmingham MP Tahir Ali asked the prime minister to introduce measures \u201c<a href=\"https://x.com/i/bookmarks?post_id=1861765654178640014\">to prohibit desecration of religious texts</a> and targeted vilification of all the prophets of the Abrahamic faiths\u201d. Keir Starmer\u2019s answer should have been a simple \u201cNo. It is not the job of the state in a secular society to enforce respect of religious texts and prophets, whether of the Abrahamic faiths or not.\u201d Instead, he replied, \u201cWe are\u2026 committed to tackling all forms of hatred and division, including Islamophobia in all its forms\u201d, refusing to take a stand on the issue or to reject outright Ali\u2019s proposal for the reintroduction of blasphemy restrictions.</p> <p>But if a truly secular Britain would have no blasphemy laws (nor \u201coffence\u201d laws acting as surrogates for blasphemy laws), it would also have no issue with religious believers expressing their views in the public sphere. We need to defend secular space from religions demanding privileges. We need also to protect freedom of conscience and religious expression from an over-zealous secular state.</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I was reminded of those students as the row developed last week over justice secretary\u2019s Shabana Mahmood\u2019s opposition to Kim Leadbeater\u2019s assisted dying bill and the former lord chancellor Lord Falconer\u2019s curt dismissal of it. \u201cAs a Muslim, I have an unshakeable belief in the sanctity and the value of human life\u201d, Mahmood had told the Times in October, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t think that death is a service that the state should be offering.\u201d Those sentiments returned to the headlines after a letter she wrote to her constituents, expressing her opposition to the proposed law, was made public. \u201cI respect\u2026 [the] religious and spiritual reasons why she believes completely in the sanctity of life,\u201d Falconer told Sky News. \u201cBut I do not think it should be imposed on everybody else.\u201d On Friday, parliament gave a second reading to Leadbeater\u2019s bill, beginning the process of turning it into law. Falconer\u2019s comments, though, and the debate around them, were directed not simply at this particular debate but expressed a deeper unease about the role of religion in public life and the boundaries of a secular society. For many of its advocates, secularism requires religion to be excluded from the public sphere and from political debate. This, ironically, is an understanding of secularism not so different from that of the theology students, though viewed from the opposite end of the telescope. The trainee priests worried about secularism because they feared religion might lose its public voice. And what Falconer feared, they insisted was true: that their faith determined their moral and political views. The reality is more complicated. Certainly, the \u201cas a\u201d prefix to an argument (\u201cas a Muslim\u201d, \u201cas a Jew\u201d, \u201cas a woman\u201d, \u201cas a white American\u201d, I believe that\u2026) is one of the abominations of contemporary politics. Not only does it shut off debate by insisting that one\u2019s identity or faith defines the limits of one\u2019s views, it also suggests that Muslims, Jews, women, white Americans and every other identity group have, or should have, a particular set of values by virtue of their identity, a crass and reactionary sentiment. Insisting that God mandates particular political and moral views, and so makes them unchallengeable, is equally to close off political debate and to ignore the variety of perspectives within any faith. Yet, as I suggested to my theology students, rather than their faith determining their values and politics, it is often the case that their moral and political outlook shape how they interpret religious texts or what they imagine to be God\u2019s will. We can see this in the debate over assisted dying itself. Mahmood, a Muslim, opposed the bill, as did many Christians and Jews and Buddhists and Hindus. But many believers\u2013 possibly the majority according to some polls \u2013 disagree, even if they are more likely to oppose the measure than those who are not religious. The same God can speak to many moral perspectives. Mahmood is wrong to suggest that \u201cas a Muslim\u201d she can hold only one view on this or any other debate. Falconer is wrong to suggest that for Mahmood to express her faith-based view in a democratic debate is to \u201cimpose it on everyone else\u201d. Secularism is not a space from which religion must be excluded but one in which the state neither affirms nor denies any religion, and so one in which no religion is granted privilege over any another, nor over any secular philosophy or ideology. A truly secular Britain would have no established church, no state-funded religious schools and no blasphemy laws. Last Wednesday, during PMQs, Birmingham MP Tahir Ali asked the prime minister to introduce measures \u201cto prohibit desecration of religious texts and targeted vilification of all the prophets of the Abrahamic faiths\u201d. Keir Starmer\u2019s answer should have been a simple \u201cNo. It is not the job of the state in a secular society to enforce respect of religious texts and prophets, whether of the Abrahamic faiths or not.\u201d Instead, he replied, \u201cWe are\u2026 committed to tackling all forms of hatred and division, including Islamophobia in all its forms\u201d, refusing to take a stand on the issue or to reject outright Ali\u2019s proposal for the reintroduction of blasphemy restrictions. But if a truly secular Britain would have no blasphemy laws (nor \u201coffence\u201d laws acting as surrogates for blasphemy laws), it would also have no issue with religious believers expressing their views in the public sphere. We need to defend secular space from religions demanding privileges. We need also to protect freedom of conscience and religious expression from an over-zealous secular state. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "body": "<p>A splinter of desperation has attached itself to my sorry attempts to romanticise my life. I guess the project started in lockdown as I, along with everyone else, scrabbled around for ways to get through the days with our humanity intact. I lit little candles, you know. Kept the fairy lights on. Working from home, I wore a heel under the desk, though that was short-lived as I tripped on my dressing gown. I upgraded said gown, incidentally \u2013 on eBay I bought 1 x silky kimono thing, and for the darker months, in which we now find ourselves, something belted and lilac in silk velvet. The plan was that I could always throw it on top of my grumping thermals to add that shard of glamour when the Asda delivery man arrived, but I fear it falls slightly short of the 1930s Hollywood vision I was aiming for, and I look more like \u201ca person going through something\u201d.</p> <p>Which to be fair, is not <em>not</em> true. Who of us, especially those of us on a similar quest, those of us intent now on \u201cappreciating the little things\u201d, \u201cromanticising our life\u201d, as the phrase goes \u2013 can say different? We are the people who were drawn to this as a kind of call to action, keen to try to \u201clive with intention\u201d and look for moments of beauty, at least in part because of our inability to see it anywhere else without squinting. At first, the content this inspired was kind of lovely, in the right mood, at other times vaguely sickening. Nice ladies making extravagant coffees, and lots of tulips, avocado toast. There was something refreshing about the feeling that we were zooming in on little normal lives rather than watching grand ones from afar, beautiful people living beautifully, beyond our means. It was a quiet renouncing of the aspirational \u201cwellness\u201d world, and an embrace of accessible moments of joy. Very difficult to argue with that. Very difficult for maybe, like, six months?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A romanticised video of a girl running a bath instantly rammed a nail, for me, into the coffin of a gentle trend</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Recently, I saw one of those videos of a romanticised life that was so excruciating it made my spine itch. I\u2019ll describe it here from memory, because the thought of returning to it un-thrills me \u2013 I have this sensory allergy to the sound or feel of unglazed pottery, and this embodied for me that horrible shiver. So, some girl is running a bath, but it\u2019s more of a stew \u2013 bath salts, petals, it brought to mind the witch in Hansel and Gretel, preparing her pot. There were too many accessories required for this experience, too much admin for a process the purpose of which is, at best to relax, at worst to scrub, perhaps, dried vomit from a shoulder. But its horrors instantly rammed a nail, for me, into the coffin of a gentle trend.</p> <p>The initial appeal of romanticising one\u2019s life had been an invitation to appreciate the little things, because we felt we had no control over anything larger. You might not be able to fix the climate, the thinking went, but you certainly can fix a cocktail. Rather than focusing on an encroaching war, allow yourself maybe to focus on a glass of daffodils, in sunlight. In doing so, we first clung on to mundanity, the small delights of day-to-day life, as an escape. But soon, I fear, we started elevating these moments and placing importance on them so they had slightly too much weight to bear, narrating short videos of pasta as if documentary footage. These romanticised scenes became not just banal (if sometimes beautiful) moments in a day, but an entire lifestyle. Teethbrushing as narrative arc. Aspirational water bottle-filling at the sink.

      "bodyText": "A splinter of desperation has attached itself to my sorry attempts to romanticise my life. I guess the project started in lockdown as I, along with everyone else, scrabbled around for ways to get through the days with our humanity intact. I lit little candles, you know. Kept the fairy lights on. Working from home, I wore a heel under the desk, though that was short-lived as I tripped on my dressing gown. I upgraded said gown, incidentally \u2013 on eBay I bought 1 x silky kimono thing, and for the darker months, in which we now find ourselves, something belted and lilac in silk velvet. The plan was that I could always throw it on top of my grumping thermals to add that shard of glamour when the Asda delivery man arrived, but I fear it falls slightly short of the 1930s Hollywood vision I was aiming for, and I look more like \u201ca person going through something\u201d. Which to be fair, is not not true. Who of us, especially those of us on a similar quest, those of us intent now on \u201cappreciating the little things\u201d, \u201cromanticising our life\u201d, as the phrase goes \u2013 can say different? We are the people who were drawn to this as a kind of call to action, keen to try to \u201clive with intention\u201d and look for moments of beauty, at least in part because of our inability to see it anywhere else without squinting. At first, the content this inspired was kind of lovely, in the right mood, at other times vaguely sickening. Nice ladies making extravagant coffees, and lots of tulips, avocado toast. There was something refreshing about the feeling that we were zooming in on little normal lives rather than watching grand ones from afar, beautiful people living beautifully, beyond our means. It was a quiet renouncing of the aspirational \u201cwellness\u201d world, and an embrace of accessible moments of joy. Very difficult to argue with that. Very difficult for maybe, like, six months? Recently, I saw one of those videos of a romanticised life that was so excruciating it made my spine itch. I\u2019ll describe it here from memory, because the thought of returning to it un-thrills me \u2013 I have this sensory allergy to the sound or feel of unglazed pottery, and this embodied for me that horrible shiver. So, some girl is running a bath, but it\u2019s more of a stew \u2013 bath salts, petals, it brought to mind the witch in Hansel and Gretel, preparing her pot. There were too many accessories required for this experience, too much admin for a process the purpose of which is, at best to relax, at worst to scrub, perhaps, dried vomit from a shoulder. But its horrors instantly rammed a nail, for me, into the coffin of a gentle trend. The initial appeal of romanticising one\u2019s life had been an invitation to appreciate the little things, because we felt we had no control over anything larger. You might not be able to fix the climate, the thinking went, but you certainly can fix a cocktail. Rather than focusing on an encroaching war, allow yourself maybe to focus on a glass of daffodils, in sunlight. In doing so, we first clung on to mundanity, the small delights of day-to-day life, as an escape. But soon, I fear, we started elevating these moments and placing importance on them so they had slightly too much weight to bear, narrating short videos of pasta as if documentary footage. These romanticised scenes became not just banal (if sometimes beautiful) moments in a day, but an entire lifestyle. Teethbrushing as narrative arc. Aspirational water bottle-filling at the sink. By sharing these dull and private gestures they were granted even more importance, beyond even the intimate significance we\u2019d already attached to them, and they became examples of (and here is another phrase that sprung out of the internet in recent years, attaching itself abstractly to modern life) \u201cmain character energy\u201d. This revolves around the idea that if life is a story, you are the star.

      "body": "<p>Deep inside the Vienna Ice Skating Club, an enormous ice rink temporarily adapted into indoor tennis courts in October, Jack Draper was hard at work before one of his final tournaments of the season. His sparring partner for the day was Frances Tiafoe, a fellow top-20 player well known for his humour <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/05/carlos-alcaraz-pushed-all-the-way-in-thrilling-five-set-win-over-frances-tiafoe\">even in the searing heat of battle</a>. As they toiled through practice sets, the American kept on reacting to their spectacular winners by glancing down the court, each time trying to catch his opponent\u2019s eye so that he could crack another joke.</p> <p>Draper, however, had other priorities. The British No 1 was completely locked in, focused only on extracting the best out of himself in their limited time on court. He played some brutal, attacking tennis in the process and after an hour of great intensity, their practice ended with Draper leading by a set.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/29/andy-murray-novak-djokovic-coaching-partnership\">Coach Andy Murray could make all the difference in Novak Djokovic\u2019s push for history</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Throughout this year Draper has continually noted that his breakthrough performances are a consequence of the consistent daily work and professionalism he has recently embraced. In that silent Viennese hall, with no one else watching, his focus was undeniable.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was younger, I didn\u2019t really have much of a working mentality,\u201d says Draper, who turns 23 on 22 December. \u201cWhen you\u2019re young, you step into the world of tennis and you don\u2019t really know what it\u2019s all about. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a brutal change, because you realise that if you want to be good, you have to mature and be an adult when you\u2019re 20 years old. I wasn\u2019t quite ready for that; I didn\u2019t want to put in hard work. I didn\u2019t want to sacrifice. I didn\u2019t want to be professional. I didn\u2019t want to do all the things it takes.\u201d</p> <p>It was not until Draper missed the grass season last year, including Wimbledon, with a shoulder injury that this mentality shifted. Until then his countless injuries and physical problems had essentially defined his career. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s when the penny dropped that I really needed to change,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m very, very proud of the way I took it upon myself to really be different and I\u2019ve got a lot of rewards from those decisions. A lot of good things have come from just trying to really take it upon myself to be better and grow, be a better person, be more independent and just more of a man.\u201d</p> <p>By the end of the week in Austria, Draper\u2019s efforts had yielded another significant reward as he earned the biggest title of his career<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2024/oct/27/jack-draper-beats-karen-khachanov-to-secure-vienna-open-victory-video-highlights#:~:text=Jack%20Draper%20clinched%20the%20biggest,4%2C%207%2D5%20win.\"> at the Vienna Open</a>, his first ATP 500 success. It was the perfect way to punctuate a year when he has established himself as the new leader of British men\u2019s tennis. He finished 2024 with his first two ATP titles, his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/sep/07/jannik-sinner-brings-jack-drapers-new-york-adventure-to-a-brutal-end\">first grand slam semi-final, at the US Open</a> in September, and a career-high ranking of 14.</p> <p>Things were not always smooth this year. Halfway through the season, every other match he played seemed to end in brutal three-set losses. Still, Draper handled his disappointments and doubts with maturity, always hopeful that he remained on the right path. \u201cI think it was good for me,\u201d he says.</p>    <p>\u201cI hear people say all the time that it\u2019s not the achievement that feels great, it\u2019s the process of the achievement. Going through all that; all the work, the doubts, the worries and the kind of like: \u2018Am I going to do this? Am I going to that?\u2019 It\u2019s the actual work that you put in which is the enjoyable part. </p> <p>\u201cLooking back over this year, I\u2019ve had some amazing moments that made me feel good, but I\u2019ve also learned to enjoy all the hard work and all the tough things that go with&nbsp;it.\u201d</p> <p>Maturity has been a common theme in a year when he has also gained greater independence away from the court. A couple of years ago, the kitchen in his family home was such uncharted territory that he decided to ask his good friend Jannik Sinner for advice. </p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to cook anything,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cHe\u2019s Italian, so I thought he\u2019d know how to make pasta. I should have just asked my mum, but I didn\u2019t. He did a good pasta and taught me how to do it.\u201d</p> <p>In recent months, though, he has bought his own place, moving back in with his close friend and former flatmate Paul Jubb, a fellow British player. Before his move Draper had spent months this year lodging at the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton, south London, a less than ideal arrangement. He has embraced the independence and responsibilities that come with taking care of his home and himself, including cooking. Naturally, he is starting to feel more like an adult.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a lot calmer,\u201d he says. \u201cI have a lot more belief in my tennis and my life outside of the court. It\u2019s hard as a young player. You\u2019re so busy with playing tennis, your [personal] life is kind of put on hold. But I\u2019ve understood to have a good balance. In London, I can train, but I\u2019ve also got my own place. I feel very content with a lot of things and I\u2019ve just become more my own person.\u201d</p> <p>New doors have also been opened to him. A day after he competed at the Davis Cup, he was sitting front row at the Burberry London fashion week show \u2013 \u201ca bit of a weird experience\u201d \u2013 and a completely different world to his usual surroundings but an afternoon he enjoyed. \u201cPeople say: \u2018Oh, he\u2019s got a modelling contract,\u2019 or whatever. I really don\u2019t. I\u2019ve done a couple of things here and there.\u201d</p> <p>Of all the prominent athletes and celebrities there, Draper made a point of seeking out a picture with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/jul/07/skepta-review-grime-big-smoke-london\">the British rapper Skepta</a>: \u201cI said to him: \u2018I listen to your music before I play, I respect you, I think you\u2019re an unbelievable artist.\u2019\u201d UK rap, from Skepta to Central Cee, soundtracks Draper\u2019s day-to-day life but his music tastes are varied. He says he will gladly clean his house listening to classical music and when his favourite band from childhood, Oasis, announced their reunion tour this year, he made sure to track down a ticket.</p> <p>Draper also had to endure his first taste of controversy this year. Up a match point against F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime at the Cincinnati Open, the umpire failed to notice the ball had marginally bounced twice before Draper hit a drop-volley winner. In the aftermath, as fans (and some players) gathered on his social media pages with pitchforks and torches, Draper acknowledged the error but asserted he had been genuinely unsure about the double&nbsp;bounce.</p> <p>While plenty may have been left overly defensive by the barrage of questions he received on the topic before the US Open, it was impressive to see Draper address it with patience and sincerity and his honesty meant the furore quickly blew over. It was, however, a reminder that incessant scrutiny and even abuse is something that he has no choice but to get used to.</p> <p>\u201cMy first pro match in 2018, I think I won love and love [6-0, 6-0], and I was a horrible person \u2013 they were going to find my mum,\u201d Draper says. \u201cIt\u2019s every match, whether you win or lose, you get hundreds of messages from people and you can\u2019t really stop it. </p> <p>\u201cIf I lose a match these days, just go on my latest Instagram account \u2013 you\u2019ll probably see about 100 messages with clown emojis and snakes and all this sort of stuff. You can\u2019t control it. Everyone has it, and especially the girls. The girls get it way worse than the guys.\u201d</p> <p>If a player is receiving more scrutiny, it usually means they are winning more matches, which remains Draper\u2019s ultimate objective. In the aftermath of the Vienna Open, as he considered his aims for the coming season, it was interesting to see him mention two prominent names without hesitation. Draper hoped that in 2025 he might begin to chase after players such as Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz while battling for the biggest titles. His growth on and off the court has shown these lofty goals are within reach.</p>",

The girls get it way worse than the guys.\u201d If a player is receiving more scrutiny, it usually means they are winning more matches, which remains Draper\u2019s ultimate objective. In the aftermath of the Vienna Open, as he considered his aims for the coming season, it was interesting to see him mention two prominent names without hesitation. Draper hoped that in 2025 he might begin to chase after players such as Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz while battling for the biggest titles. His growth on and off the court has shown these lofty goals are within reach.",

Perhaps the seemingly disposable likes of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/13/hot-frosty-review-netflix\">Hot Frosty</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/06/meet-me-next-christmas-review-netflix-romcom\">Meet Me Next Christmas</a></em> will be treasured for many Decembers to come, but they have a tough canon to crack, as represented by our all-star Advent calendar of festive movie favourites, chosen by some of the film industry\u2019s best and brightest, invited by the <em>Observer New Review</em> to help our readers count down to the big day itself.<br><br>Some of the films here are as firmly entrenched in the season as mince pies and fir trees \u2013 who can argue with director Gurinder Chadha\u2019s selection of <em>It\u2019s a Wonderful Life</em> or actor Joe Alwyn\u2019s of <em>The Snowman</em>? Others are less obvious: you wouldn\u2019t expect John Waters, Hollywood\u2019s emperor of bad taste, to go cosy and cute, and sure enough, his choice of the notorious video nasty <em>Christmas Evil</em> would make many a person bring up their turkey dinner. For a lot of us, meanwhile, our personal Christmas classics aren\u2019t technically Christmas films at all, but made so by timing and association: we\u2019re steering clear of the played-out <em>Die Hard</em> debate, but Himesh Patel certainly isn\u2019t alone in finding the holiday incomplete without the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy, and screenwriter David Nicholls makes a strong case for <em>Phantom Thread</em> as festive viewing. To each their own Christmas, and to all a good night.</p> \n<h2><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Tokyo Godfathers (Satoshi Kon, 2003)</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Chosen by <strong>Will Sharpe</strong>, director of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/02/the-electrical-life-of-louis-wain-review-cat-artist-benedict-cumberbatch-claire-foy\">The Electrical Life of Louis Wain</a> and Landscapers, star of The White Lotus and Giri/Haji</em></p> \n<p><em>Tokyo Godfathers</em> by renowned Japanese animator Satoshi Kon is a funny, heartwarming tale but without being overly saccharine. Three homeless people \u2013 a grumbly alcoholic man, a larger than life transgender woman and a punky runaway teenage girl \u2013 come across a baby in a bin while rummaging for presents. They form a sort of hotchpotch family in a brilliant dynamic that reminds me of some of Kore-eda\u2019s films. Backstories intertwine with a quest to find the baby\u2019s parents that takes us through drag bars, yakuza action sequences, car chases and even a Christmas miracle of sorts. The animation is stunning. It\u2019s festive but not without a bit of grime. And hey \u2013 it\u2019s 88 minutes long.</p> \n<h2><strong>2. </strong><strong>Radio Days</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(Woody Allen, 1987)</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Chosen by <strong>Mike Leigh</strong>, director of </em><em>Secrets and Lies, Vera Drake and Hard Truths</em><em>, out on 31 January</em></p> \n<p>What better movie for warming the December cockles than <em>Radio Days</em>? I\u2019m by no means a fan of all Woody Allen\u2019s films, but this joyous masterpiece is one of my favourites of all cinema, and I revisit it regularly.</p> \n<p>Sumptuously evocative of the 30s and 40s, it combines brilliantly the tawdry razzmatazz of Manhattan showbusiness with a hard-edged, tragicomic yet moving portrayal of suburban New York Jewish working-class life, all viewed through the perceptive eyes of a sharp young lad. The acting throughout is immaculate. Headed by Mia Farrow, the huge cast deliver a stunning gallery of realistic character performances, and the whole glorious feast is accompanied by numbers from Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington and Cole Porter, to name but a few. It\u2019s wonderful!</p> \n<h2><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Love Actually (Richard Curtis, 2003)</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Chosen by <strong>Thea Sharrock</strong>, director of </em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/24/wicked-little-letters-review-thea-sharrock-olivia-colman-jessie-buckley-deliciously-sweary-poison-pen-mystery\">Wicked Little Letters</a> and The Beautiful Game</em></p> \n<p>As with all Christmas classics, <em>Love Actually</em> offers great comfort with every watch. Richard Curtis at his very best, giving audiences exactly what they want: actors we all adore, great music, comedy, love, heartbreak, family. Simple, relatable human stories set at Christmas time. Emma Thompson with Joni Mitchell is pure gold; Bill Nighy\u2019s laugh; Alan Rickman\u2019s twinkle; Hugh Grant\u2019s dancing; Keira Knightley\u2019s smile. Perfection. We watch it every Christmas, guaranteed, although we\u2019re always open to new additions to go alongside it on the Christmas watchlist. Anywhere, any time is good for watching <em>Love Actually</em>; the only non-negotiable is to have my sons with me. They are teenagers now, and it\u2019s their favourite too. They have grown up with it so it became a family classic as they looked forward to it every year. To be honest, I prefer birthdays and new year to Christmas, although I do love going away over the holidays. And I\u2019m a sucker for a good stocking.</p> \n<h2><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (Stanley Donen, 1954)</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Chosen by <strong>Abi Morgan</strong>, writer of The Split, Eric, The Hour and Suffragette</em></p> \n<p>Christmas has a huge legacy for me: it\u2019s years of joy and fights and dramas and laughter and great movies and a lot of chocolate. It\u2019s impossible not to get picked up in the swell of it. This is a film that I loved as a kid, a Technicolor musical filled with swashbuckling men and beautiful women. I\u2019ve always loved the songs, and the whole will-they-won\u2019t-they of it, but it\u2019s also deeply disturbing. It\u2019s about a guy who goes into town one day, meets the beautiful Jane Powell and proposes to her, but fails to reveal that he\u2019s got six brothers at home and she\u2019s responsible for looking after them all. Then the brothers go out and basically kidnap a load of women. Watching it, you\u2019re reminded that history repeats itself as women\u2019s rights are being taken away in the US. But it\u2019s got some damn good songs and it\u2019s really beautiful film-making \u2013 a fascinating bit of history to chew over at Christmas.</p> \n<h2><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Phantom Thread (Paul Thomas Anderson, 2017)</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Chosen by <strong>David Nicholls</strong>, screenwriter and author of, most recently, You Are Here. On screen he has had hits with Us, Patrick Melrose and adaptations of his novels One Day and Starter for </em><em>10</em></p> \n<p>The parties, the dressing-up, the food and cocktails, the chilly, anxious atmosphere; I have no doubt that <em>Phantom Thread</em> is a Christmas film. A gothic love story \u2013 <em>Rebecca</em> by way of Powell and Pressburger, with Lesley Manville in the Mrs Danvers role \u2013 on first viewing I found it quite bizarre, but I\u2019ve grown to love it more and more, not least for its knowingness, a sly humour that saves it from absurdity. Daniel Day-Lewis and Vicky Krieps are wonderful, it\u2019s immaculately made and eminently quotable, has one of the great New Year\u2019s Eve scenes and the greatest breakfast too, the famous \u201chungry boy\u201d. Altogether now: \u201cWelsh rarebit with a poached egg on top, not too runny, and bacon, scones, butter, cream, jam (not strawberry)\u2026\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>6</strong>. <strong>Christmas Evil (Lewis Jackson, 1980)</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Chosen by <strong>John Waters</strong>, director of </em><em>Pink Flamingos, Hairspray and Female Trouble</em></p> \n<p>I, with no irony, love Christmas: I do 20 Christmas shows a year; I wrote a chapter of my book called Why I Love Christmas. I\u2019ve learned how to exploit Christmas, even though I know Christmas exploits me.</p> \n<p>This is the only Christmas movie I like; I find most of them so horribly sentimental. I don\u2019t watch it every Christmas. But if I meet somebody new, it would be a first date \u2013 and if they didn\u2019t like it, I would end it. It\u2019s a litmus test. It starts as someone putting on shaving cream, then looking in the mirror, and suddenly they think: \u201cOh my God! I\u2019m Santa Claus.\u201d Well, I like that. That\u2019s a disturbing psychological profile. If you think about it, Santa is a pervert. He sneaks around children\u2019s lives and spies through windows and keeps notes if they\u2019re bad \u2013 that would be getting him arrested today. He slides down your chimney without permission. That\u2019s a home invasion. He eats your food in your house. That\u2019s unsafe. So this movie celebrates the insanity of someone really believing they were Santa Claus. And I love that the children save him at the end, even though he\u2019s killed people, because they believe in him and the adults don\u2019t.</p> \n<p>This film was actually banned in the UK during the \u201cvideo nasty\u201d panic. This film isn\u2019t nasty. It\u2019s delightful to me. What\u2019s nasty is all the other sentimental Christmas movies that make you gag. They should have the opposite of the nasties \u2013 they should have had a ban on the whimsical. That\u2019s the one I\u2019d join.</p> \n<h2><strong>7. </strong><strong>Carol (Todd Haynes, 2015)</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Chosen by <strong>Mahalia Belo</strong>, director of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/20/the-end-we-start-from-review-jodie-comer-mahalia-belo-megan-hunter\">The End We Start From</a></em></p> \n<p>At this time of year, on a cold night, I find myself wanting to be swept up in the world of <em>Carol</em>. There\u2019s something about the intimacy of it, and the Saul Leiter-style cinematography, that brings you completely into its universe rich with desire. It\u2019s about a young woman who sees across the floor of the department store where she works an enigmatic, beautiful woman named Carol. The film, set in the 1950s, explores the connection these women make as the world rattles on and tries to interrupt them. Cate Blanchett, as Carol, beautifully plays a woman trying to find her own space in the world, while not losing everything she loves. It\u2019s very seductive and incredibly well told \u2013 and it\u2019s set at Christmastime.</p> \n<h2><strong>8.</strong> <strong>The Snowman (Jimmy T Murakami </strong><strong>and Dianne Jackson, 1982)</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Chosen by <strong>Joe Alwyn</strong>, star of The Favourite, Conversations With Friends and The Brutalist, out on 24 January</em></p> \n<p>I love this film. A boy and his snowman on Christmas Eve. It feels nostalgic and bittersweet. There\u2019s a wonder to it, a dreamlike possibility. Magic, joy, escapism \u2013 but also heartbreak. The painful truth that nothing lasts for ever. Everything melts. Watching the film takes me back to memories of my grandparents, and of sitting by the fire at home. I think of being a boy \u2013 dreaming, longing, needing magic to exist. The version we watched was introduced by David Bowie, and that takes me straight to my mum, and to Life on Mars playing throughout our house. I remember the hand-drawn animation \u2013 a picture book brought to life. And then, of course, the music: Walking in the Air fills the room, hairs prickling, neck tingling, as the boy and his snowman leap into the night sky, hand in hand. It\u2019s a haunting melody and voice; as lonely as it is beautiful.</p> \n<h2><strong>9.</strong> <strong>Babes in Toyland (Gus Meins and Charley Rogers, 1934)</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Chosen by <strong>Sean Baker</strong>, director of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/03/anora-review-sean-baker-screwball-cinderella-tale-vaults-him-towards-greatness-mikey-madison#:~:text=Anora%2C%20the%20brilliant%20new%20picture,caper%20vaults%20him%20towards%20greatness.\">Anora</a>, The Florida Project, and Tangerine</em></p> \n<p>This was <em>the</em> holiday movie growing up, or at least <em>my</em> holiday movie. Television stations in the New York area played it on Thanksgiving to get you psyched up for Christmas. It\u2019s a very early example of breaking the fourth wall and the humour is quite modern, though it gets pretty dark and scary. Laurel and Hardy are basically playing themselves in the world of Toyland. There\u2019s an evil businessman in town, Barnaby, who\u2019s reclaiming Mother Peep\u2019s house because she\u2019s failed to pay off her mortgage. He has these boogeymen who he sets on Toyland at the end. It\u2019s the most disturbing thing but also incredibly artistic \u2013 the sets and costumes are amazing. It delivers everything you need for a holiday movie. I saw it many times as a kid, to the point where I actually used Toyland, the song, in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/15/tangerine-review-sean-baker-la\">Tangerine</a></em> \u2013 that\u2019s how much of an impact it had on my life.</p> \n<p>Christmas gives me a break. Anytime the world shuts down for a little bit so I can catch up, that\u2019s what I look forward to. Obviously we all like the family stuff, blah blah blah. Yeah, I\u2019m fine with Christmas.</p> \n<h2><strong>10.</strong> <strong>It\u2019s a Wonderful Life (Frank Capra, 1946)</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Chosen by <strong>Gurinder Chadha</strong>, director of Bend It Like Beckham and Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging</em></p> \n<p>This is my favourite Christmas film because it does everything a holiday movie should do in this season of goodwill to all. It touches you, makes you feel connected to humanity, and takes you on an emotional rollercoaster where you come away appreciating life, love, family and community. Each year I take my kids to watch it on the big screen at the Prince Charles Cinema in Leicester Square with a big bucket of popcorn. When the kids were little they didn\u2019t like that the film was black and white, but now that they\u2019re 17, they enjoy our tradition and understand why every year I\u2019m in tears at the scene when everyone brings whatever savings they have to save the almost ruined George Bailey. I love the film even more because upon release it was considered a flop. How gratifying for me as a film-maker that years later Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart are given the respect they deserve for making an unsurpassed, timeless classic.</p> \n<p>The film is inspired by Charles Dickens\u2019s <em>A Christmas Carol</em>. I\u2019m currently in the edit room endeavouring to make my own Christmas film. It\u2019s a joyous modern musical where my Scrooge is British Indian and dislikes poor, disenfranchised people. If I can make a film that moves future generations and becomes a holiday tradition like <em>It\u2019s a Wonderful Life</em>, I\u2019ll feel like I\u2019ve taken the spirit of Frank Capra and tried my best to emulate his craft, compassion and heartfelt plea to view life through a lens of gratitude.</p> \n<h2><strong>11.</strong> <strong>Miracle in Milan </strong><strong>(Vittorio De Sica, 1951)</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Chosen by <strong>Alice Rohrwacher</strong>, director of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/12/la-chimera-review-josh-oconnor-dazzles-in-brilliant-tale-of-italian-tomb-raiders#:~:text=There's%20something%20about%20the%20folkloric,of%20grit%2C%20thorns%20and%20greed.\">La Chimera</a>, Happy As Lazzaro and 2022 Christmas short </em><em>Le Pupille</em></p> \n<p>This is a sociopolitical fairytale about a boy who is born under a cabbage. He is very poor, but always thinks that everything is possible. There is one scene when all the people try to get some sun in a world that has none, and there is just one ray of sunshine coming out, so they all have to run to it to warm up. And it\u2019s so touching. When I did <em>Le Pupille</em> I was asking myself, what is a Christmas movie? And the difference between a movie and a Christmas movie is that it\u2019s a story with a moral message. In <em>Le Pupille</em>, the moral is \u201cdestiny works in mysterious ways\u201d. The moral of <em>Miracolo a Milano</em> is that, if you change your eyes, things change \u2013 society changes.</p> \n<h2><strong>12. </strong><strong>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Peter Jackson, 2003)</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Chosen by <strong>Himesh Patel</strong>, star of Yesterday, Don\u2019t Look Up and Station Eleven</em></p> \n<p>When I think of Peter Jackson\u2019s <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy, I think of Christmas. The films were released during the festive period from 2001 to 2003 and became one of the most important cultural touchstones of my generation. Those Christmases held not just the usual festive joys, but the promise of the next chapter in this epic, gamechanging cinematic trilogy. Tolkien\u2019s world filled my head for the entire holiday period. <em>The Return of the King</em> was the culmination, the finale. In my memory, it was all anyone at school was talking about in the lead up to the holidays.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s not something I watch every Christmas \u2013 convincing my family to sit through three hours and 21 minutes of an epic fantasy film isn\u2019t something I\u2019m silly enough to attempt. Not to mention the first two films or the extended editions\u2026 Generally the festive period now is about catching up on the year\u2019s best films.</p> \n<p>For me the perfect Christmas film is something that brings the whole family together, takes us through a rollercoaster of emotions and leaves us all tearily hugging one another or jumping for joy. So one day I hope to find myself in the ideal scenario: watching <em>The Return of the King</em> with my wife and my daughters, making our way through a feast of snacks, all trying not to cry when Aragorn says to the hobbits: \u201cMy friends, you bow to no one.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>13.</strong> <strong>The Holdovers (Alexander Payne, 2023), preceded by the short film Anthony (Jonathan van Tulleken, 2014)</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Chosen by <strong>Jack Thorne</strong>, award-winning playwright and screenwriter who co-wrote the animated short An Almost Christmas Story (on Disney+). His adaptation of A Christmas Carol runs until 7 January at the Old Vic, London</em></p> \n<p>I think cinema should be made into more of an event again, so this is a petition for the restoration of the short film that comes before the main feature. The one I remember from childhood was <em>Tummy Trouble</em>, with Roger Rabbit, before <em>Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</em>. Both were brilliant. I loved Rick Moranis already, but him combined with Roger? Fantastic.</p> \n<p>We start with <em>Anthony</em>, a short film of remarkable brutality. The plot is that the sled crash lands and only Santa and a single elf, Anthony, have survived and they have to work out how to save Christmas. I don\u2019t want to spoil too much but reindeers are murdered and then worn and that causes further murder. It\u2019s really funny and brilliant. After the acrid taste of <em>Anthony</em> comes the acrid teacher Paul Hunham in<em> The Holdovers</em>. He is a man who has had his heart ripped out by life. He spends Christmas with a student called Angus, played by Dominic Sessa, and cafeteria manager Mary (Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph). It is a film where little shards of dialogue reveal a gulf of unspoken truth. The end left me both punching the air and crying. It depends who your family are, but mine are mostly self-destructive and will be uplifted by this film, just as they were disgusted by <em>Anthony</em>.</p> \n<h2><strong>14.</strong> <strong>Fanny and Alexander (Ingmar Bergman, 1982)</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Chosen by <strong>Richard Eyre</strong>, director of Iris, Notes on a Scandal and The Children Act</em></p> \n<p>Bergman\u2019s film revolves around two overlapping worlds that fascinate me: the family and the theatre. There\u2019s a Dickensian profligacy in the range of characters in the film but they\u2019re all portrayed with a meticulous humanity worthy of Chekhov: the family saga resonates with realism about life\u2019s compromises.</p> \n<p>The choreography of the film \u2013 the movement of characters (living and dead), of the camera, of the locations, of the festivities \u2013 is miraculously fresh and inventive. Bergman\u2019s cool draughtsman\u2019s eye combines with his forgiving heart to create extraordinary performances and, for a director who is often castigated for his gloom and sense of mortality, the film is radiant with warmth and fun.</p> \n<h2><strong>15.</strong> <strong>Gone With the Wind (Victor Fleming, 1939)</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Chosen by <strong>James Ivory</strong>,</em><em> director of Howards End, The Remains of the Day and The Golden Bowl</em></p> \n<p>I must have been 12 when I first watched<em> Gone With the Wind</em>. At the very end Clark Gable says, \u201cFrankly, my dear, I don\u2019t give a damn\u201d, and it was considered so shocking that that word had been used in a family movie. I went to a school that was taught by nuns, and they said: \u201cWhen Clark Gable uses that word, you must cover your ears.\u201d I don\u2019t know how the sisters in the school knew he was going to say that \u2013 they hadn\u2019t seen the movie. Who came and told the nuns that Clark Gable said \u201cdamn\u201d? Of course I didn\u2019t cover my ears. My mother said \u201cdamn\u201d, and so did my father. Sometimes \u201cgoddamn\u201d.</p> \n<p>Somewhere in the film, there\u2019s a scene where <a href=\"https://youtu.be/W77q1S8EW3c?si=r7BBZQXtqYsvQIg4&amp;t=72\">Ashley Wilkes comes home for Christmas from the front, and his wife has knitted him a pair of gloves</a>, and he\u2019s very touched by that. That\u2019s what I remember \u2013 him coming home for Christmas and being given a present by a woman who loves him passionately. It was a very muted scene, with quiet colours \u2013 the colour of a pair of new woollen gloves.</p> \n<h2><strong>16. </strong><strong>The Silent Partner (Daryl Duke, 1978)</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Chosen by <strong>Peter Strickland</strong>, director of The Duke of Burgundy, In Fabric and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/02/berberian-sound-studio-review-french\">Berberian Sound Studio</a></em></p> \n<p>I was very lucky to enjoy Christmas as a child even if I was bored out of my brains at church \u2013 a double dose with Greek Orthodox followed by Anglican. I love films like<em> </em><em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em> and<em> </em><em>Meet Me in St Louis</em>. But the film that indiscriminately tramples on all festive goodwill is <em>The Silent Partner</em>. Though hardly embodying the Christmas spirit, the film technically takes place during that period. Christopher Plummer, sporting a shocking string vest under his Santa Claus bank robber outfit, portrays a hideously sleazy psycho that I struggle to tally up with his more gentlemanly Captain von Trapp in <em>The Sound of Music</em>. My elder brother and I covertly saw the film late at night on television in the late 80s, but the screaming woke our mum and she stormed downstairs to turn it off. It took more than 20 years to see the rest of the film in its entirety, and I\u2019d concede that my mum had a point, given how terrifying it is.</p> \n<h2><strong>17.</strong> <strong>Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (Chris Columbus, 1992)</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Chosen by <strong>Leila Farzad</strong>, star of I Hate Suzie, Kaos and Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, out on 14 February</em></p> \n<p><em>Home Alone 2</em> is the perfect Christmas film because it encapsulates a particular nostalgia that is so cosy and calming to me. When I watch it, it\u2019s 1994 and I\u2019m in my pyjamas, excited about Christmas, fixated on my Advent calendar and full of that pure hygge feeling. I watch it every Christmas without fail sometime around mid-December to ignite the festive feeling. The cast of this film is incredible: Macaulay Culkin at his height, Catherine O\u2019Hara with her exquisite comic timing, Brenda Fricker as the beautifully tragic bird lady, Tim Curry being camp and hysterical, and of course Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci being the best bozo criminals you\u2019ve ever seen. The Christmas films that really give me the feels are often set in 1990s New York where the city feels almost fictitious. It\u2019s skyscrapers, Fifth Avenue, yellow cabs honking, everyone rushing about in great big fur coats holding piles of gifts, steam billowing up from the streets and everyone\u2019s problems are, fundamentally, not actual problems. Ideally I watch it with my family (some of whom groan) on a chilly December evening with the glow of our tree in the corner of the room and me trying not to say all my favourite lines and hum the music. It\u2019s not profound but it sure is Christmassy.</p> \n<h2><strong>18.</strong> <strong>The Kid (Charlie Chaplin, 1921)</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Chosen by <strong>Paul King</strong>, director of Wonka and the first two Paddington </em><em>films</em></p> \n<p>I love Christmas and London, where I live, is a great Christmas city. When there\u2019s mist illuminated by street lamps, the shops are full of goodies and there\u2019s everything to look forward to, it\u2019s a wonderful time of year. It\u2019s a great moment for families coming together, and what I love most about <em>The Kid</em> is that it\u2019s a very strange family that gets put together. A woman abandons her baby son in the back of a rich person\u2019s car but he ends up in the hands of Charlie Chaplin\u2019s Tramp character, who brings him up without a penny to his name and they form the most deep and beautiful screen relationship I know. It\u2019s heartwarming and incredibly funny and I love its dark twists. I showed it to my daughter aged four or five and she laughed like a drain and howled at the end. It\u2019s a great movie to watch by the fire at Christmas with your family.</p> \n<h2><strong>19. </strong><strong>The Dead Zone (David Cronenberg, 1983)</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Chosen by <strong>Mark Jenkin</strong>, director of Bait and Enys Men</em></p> \n<p>I\u2019m quite happy watching anything at Christmas \u2013 just sitting down and watching films at 10 o\u2019clock in the morning is such a luxury. I try to tell myself that, because I\u2019m a film director, I can do that, it\u2019s work. This is a film I saw at Christmas when I was probably too young to watch it \u2013 I would have been about nine or 10. I rediscovered it a few years ago and have watched it several times since. It always takes me back to being a kid, at that age when Christmas is still quite magical, which is in complete contrast to the film \u2013 although it is set in the winter, and there is a Christmas scene. They call it a science-fiction thriller, but for me, it\u2019s just a straight-up horror film.</p> \n<p>Christopher Walken stars as Johnny Smith, a schoolteacher who suffers a near-fatal car accident. He\u2019s in a coma for several years, and when he comes round he\u2019s left with this gift to see into people\u2019s lives if he physically comes into contact with them. He\u2019s able to do some amazing work in terms of helping people out and avoiding disaster, but at the cost of the relationship that he lost. Watching it again in the light of the US election, there\u2019s some interesting parallels. Martin Sheen plays a rightwing populist who\u2019s running for president and might not have the world\u2019s best interests at heart. It\u2019s quite eerie.</p> \n<h2><strong>20. </strong><strong>The Lion in Winter (Anthony Harvey, 1968)</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Chosen by <strong>Maxine Peake</strong>, star of </em><em>Shameless, Peterloo</em><em> and Funny Cow</em></p> \n<p>A stonking melodrama set in the castle of King Henry II on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, 1183, <em>The Lion in Winter</em> is about the interplay between members of a dysfunctional family: jealousy, parental neglect and favouritism, marital infidelity. It may be set in the royal court, but it has red hot flashes of relatability. Christmas in my family has always been a troublesome time of year, so seeing a family dynamic like this writ large is oddly comforting. I adore this film for James Goldman\u2019s rich and knotty screenplay and the two extraordinary and exquisite lead performances of Katharine Hepburn and Peter O\u2019Toole. Watching the chemistry and freedom between these two behemoths of the screen always reduces me to tears, it reminds me why I love my job and always spurs me on to try harder and be better in the new year to come. It\u2019s a day after Boxing Day, late afternoon\u2026 I get the fire on, make myself a snowball (eggnog and ginger ale) and settle down on the sofa with my husband and dog\u2026 It\u2019s that kind of film.</p> \n<h2><strong>21.</strong> <strong>Bad Day at Black Rock (John Sturges, 1955)</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Chosen by </em><em><strong>Daniel Kokotajlo</strong>, director of Apostasy</em><em> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/sep/08/starve-acre-review-daniel-kokotajlo-matt-smith-morfydd-clark-andrew-michael-hurley#:~:text=Starve%20Acre%20is%20steeped%20in,wallpaper%20in%20the%20couple's%20farmhouse.\">Starve Acre</a></em></p> \n<p>I\u2019ve got a weird relationship with Christmas because it was sort of taken away from me when I was very young. My family became Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, so I didn\u2019t celebrate for a large period of my life. But since I met my partner, whose family are avid Christmas lovers, I celebrate now, and I love it. I always watch ghost stories on the BBC on Christmas Eve, and then on Christmas Day I\u2019ll watch something that\u2019s a classic, that transports you, and <em>Black Rock</em> does that for me.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s a genre-bending film: part western, part noir thriller, part horror movie, part war movie with a message. It\u2019s about this lonely figure who turns up in the west in this small town, where everybody is very hostile to him, and he\u2019s looking for someone who has disappeared. It\u2019s got themes of resilience in it, and redemption; there\u2019s nostalgia running through it. Spencer Tracy\u2019s amazing in it: his character isn\u2019t a hero in the traditional sense \u2013 he\u2019s disabled and unsure of himself, but represents a compassion and dedication to truth that still resonates with me today. It\u2019s a great film. It\u2019s got an uplifting feel that\u2019s perfect for Christmas, but it\u2019s probably more suited to those who enjoy a bit of darkness and suspense in their holiday viewing.</p> \n<h2><strong>22.</strong> <strong>Dean Spanley (Toa Fraser, 2008)</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Chosen by <strong>Gillian Anderson</strong>, star of The X Files, Sex Education and Scoop</em></p> \n<p>I love this offbeat tear-jerker of a comedic tale and have recommended it for years. It\u2019s fantastic to watch at Christmas with family for its snowy scenes and cosy interiors. But also, because it\u2019s a whimsical and profoundly moving exploration of the relationships between father and son and\u2026 master and dog. Set in Edwardian England immediately after the Boer war, the elderly, self-obsessed and offensively bigoted Horatio Fisk (Peter O\u2019Toole) struggles to deal with his eldest son\u2019s death in the war as well as the subsequent death of his grieving wife. His remaining son, Henslowe (Jeremy Northam), is beholden to his cantankerous father and tries tirelessly to console him during his reluctant weekly Thursday visits, but simply cannot win his love. But through chance encounters with a curious local Dean (Sam Neill), Henslowe and his mischievous mate Wrather (Bryan Brown), lure the dean to a series of surreal dinners where he begins to recount curious remembrances of his past life that inadvertently leads to the elder Fisk finding his heart. The film is wonderfully directed by Toa Fraser, with astonishingly good performances, and has one of my favourite scores of all time by Don McGlashan. It\u2019s just delightful and I challenge anyone who has ever struggled with a parental relationship, or ever loved a dog, not to weep during some of the later scenes.</p> \n<h2><strong>23. </strong><strong>Song of the Sea (Tomm Moore, 2014)</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Chosen by <strong>Jamie Demetriou</strong>, star of Stath Lets Flats, Fleabag and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/23/barbie-review-greta-gerwig-margot-robbie-ryan-riotous-candy-coloured-feminist-fable\">Barbie</a></em></p> \n<p>To avoid being the 1,000th person to choose <em>The Muppet Christmas Carol</em>, my pick is this exquisite Irish animated feature. Christmas family time is lovely, in a way, sure. But my most treasured Christmas tradition is the precious two to 10 hours I get to spend alone in my bedroom on Christmas Eve wrapping presents, watching <em>Song of the Sea</em> on my laptop. It is the most lovingly crafted film: every character, setting and texture oozing with a bygone truth and warmth that only the magic of 2D animation can conjure. It isn\u2019t the most traditionally Christmassy film in the world \u2013 it\u2019s about the children of a grieving lighthouse keeper and some mythical Irish seals \u2013 but to me Christmas is largely about feeling warm despite the cold, and this film is a hot-water bottle when the heating\u2019s broken.</p> \n<h2><strong>24.</strong> <strong>Miracle on 34th Street (George Seaton, 1947)</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Chosen by <strong>Carol Morley</strong>, director of The Falling, Dreams of a Life, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/oct/28/typist-artist-pirate-king-review-carol-morley-outsider-artist-audrey-amiss-monica-dolan\">Typist Artist Pirate King</a></em></p> \n<p>If I saw that <em>Miracle on 34th Street </em>was on the telly, I\u2019d have to stop whatever I was doing and watch. The film takes me back to when I knew Father Christmas existed. This all ended when I was six and my brother Paul, nine years older than me, told me he didn\u2019t exist. I acted cool, but inside I was devastated. Santa was better than believing in Jesus: Santa brought you presents! I love that <em>Miracle on 34th Street</em> is about putting the real Santa on trial for lunacy, and explores commercialism and what it is to believe in something. I adore young Natalie Wood as the cynical child who finds her imagination, and Maureen O\u2019Hara as her single mother struggling with her broken dreams. Edmund Gwenn\u2019s benign but feisty Father Christmas is perfect in every way: he says \u201cChristmas isn\u2019t just a day, it\u2019s a frame of mind\u201d. And I look for a film that can transport me to times of hope, where we can all believe in miracles.<br><strong>Interviews by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kathryn-bromwich\">Kathryn Bromwich</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/killianfox\">Killian Fox</a></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "The Christmas movie has, in recent years, become its own industrial complex, algorithmically churned out by streaming services to hit various subscriber demographic sweet spots. Perhaps the seemingly disposable likes of Hot Frosty and Meet Me Next Christmas will be treasured for many Decembers to come, but they have a tough canon to crack, as represented by our all-star Advent calendar of festive movie favourites, chosen by some of the film industry\u2019s best and brightest, invited by the Observer New Review to help our readers count down to the big day itself. Some of the films here are as firmly entrenched in the season as mince pies and fir trees \u2013 who can argue with director Gurinder Chadha\u2019s selection of It\u2019s a Wonderful Life or actor Joe Alwyn\u2019s of The Snowman? Others are less obvious: you wouldn\u2019t expect John Waters, Hollywood\u2019s emperor of bad taste, to go cosy and cute, and sure enough, his choice of the notorious video nasty Christmas Evil would make many a person bring up their turkey dinner. For a lot of us, meanwhile, our personal Christmas classics aren\u2019t technically Christmas films at all, but made so by timing and association: we\u2019re steering clear of the played-out Die Hard debate, but Himesh Patel certainly isn\u2019t alone in finding the holiday incomplete without the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and screenwriter David Nicholls makes a strong case for Phantom Thread as festive viewing. To each their own Christmas, and to all a good night. 1. Tokyo Godfathers (Satoshi Kon, 2003) Chosen by Will Sharpe, director of The Electrical Life of Louis Wain and Landscapers, star of The White Lotus and Giri/Haji Tokyo Godfathers by renowned Japanese animator Satoshi Kon is a funny, heartwarming tale but without being overly saccharine. Three homeless people \u2013 a grumbly alcoholic man, a larger than life transgender woman and a punky runaway teenage girl \u2013 come across a baby in a bin while rummaging for presents. They form a sort of hotchpotch family in a brilliant dynamic that reminds me of some of Kore-eda\u2019s films. Backstories intertwine with a quest to find the baby\u2019s parents that takes us through drag bars, yakuza action sequences, car chases and even a Christmas miracle of sorts. The animation is stunning. It\u2019s festive but not without a bit of grime. And hey \u2013 it\u2019s 88 minutes long. 2. Radio Days (Woody Allen, 1987) Chosen by Mike Leigh, director of Secrets and Lies, Vera Drake and Hard Truths, out on 31 January What better movie for warming the December cockles than Radio Days? I\u2019m by no means a fan of all Woody Allen\u2019s films, but this joyous masterpiece is one of my favourites of all cinema, and I revisit it regularly. Sumptuously evocative of the 30s and 40s, it combines brilliantly the tawdry razzmatazz of Manhattan showbusiness with a hard-edged, tragicomic yet moving portrayal of suburban New York Jewish working-class life, all viewed through the perceptive eyes of a sharp young lad. The acting throughout is immaculate. Headed by Mia Farrow, the huge cast deliver a stunning gallery of realistic character performances, and the whole glorious feast is accompanied by numbers from Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington and Cole Porter, to name but a few. It\u2019s wonderful! 3. Love Actually (Richard Curtis, 2003) Chosen by Thea Sharrock, director of Wicked Little Letters and The Beautiful Game As with all Christmas classics, Love Actually offers great comfort with every watch. Richard Curtis at his very best, giving audiences exactly what they want: actors we all adore, great music, comedy, love, heartbreak, family. Simple, relatable human stories set at Christmas time. Emma Thompson with Joni Mitchell is pure gold; Bill Nighy\u2019s laugh; Alan Rickman\u2019s twinkle; Hugh Grant\u2019s dancing; Keira Knightley\u2019s smile. Perfection. We watch it every Christmas, guaranteed, although we\u2019re always open to new additions to go alongside it on the Christmas watchlist. Anywhere, any time is good for watching Love Actually; the only non-negotiable is to have my sons with me. They are teenagers now, and it\u2019s their favourite too. They have grown up with it so it became a family classic as they looked forward to it every year. To be honest, I prefer birthdays and new year to Christmas, although I do love going away over the holidays. And I\u2019m a sucker for a good stocking. 4. Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (Stanley Donen, 1954) Chosen by Abi Morgan, writer of The Split, Eric, The Hour and Suffragette Christmas has a huge legacy for me: it\u2019s years of joy and fights and dramas and laughter and great movies and a lot of chocolate. It\u2019s impossible not to get picked up in the swell of it. This is a film that I loved as a kid, a Technicolor musical filled with swashbuckling men and beautiful women. I\u2019ve always loved the songs, and the whole will-they-won\u2019t-they of it, but it\u2019s also deeply disturbing. It\u2019s about a guy who goes into town one day, meets the beautiful Jane Powell and proposes to her, but fails to reveal that he\u2019s got six brothers at home and she\u2019s responsible for looking after them all. Then the brothers go out and basically kidnap a load of women. Watching it, you\u2019re reminded that history repeats itself as women\u2019s rights are being taken away in the US. But it\u2019s got some damn good songs and it\u2019s really beautiful film-making \u2013 a fascinating bit of history to chew over at Christmas. 5. Phantom Thread (Paul Thomas Anderson, 2017) Chosen by David Nicholls, screenwriter and author of, most recently, You Are Here. On screen he has had hits with Us, Patrick Melrose and adaptations of his novels One Day and Starter for 10 The parties, the dressing-up, the food and cocktails, the chilly, anxious atmosphere; I have no doubt that Phantom Thread is a Christmas film. A gothic love story \u2013 Rebecca by way of Powell and Pressburger, with Lesley Manville in the Mrs Danvers role \u2013 on first viewing I found it quite bizarre, but I\u2019ve grown to love it more and more, not least for its knowingness, a sly humour that saves it from absurdity. Daniel Day-Lewis and Vicky Krieps are wonderful, it\u2019s immaculately made and eminently quotable, has one of the great New Year\u2019s Eve scenes and the greatest breakfast too, the famous \u201chungry boy\u201d. Altogether now: \u201cWelsh rarebit with a poached egg on top, not too runny, and bacon, scones, butter, cream, jam (not strawberry)\u2026\u201d 6. Christmas Evil (Lewis Jackson, 1980) Chosen by John Waters, director of Pink Flamingos, Hairspray and Female Trouble I, with no irony, love Christmas: I do 20 Christmas shows a year; I wrote a chapter of my book called Why I Love Christmas. I\u2019ve learned how to exploit Christmas, even though I know Christmas exploits me. This is the only Christmas movie I like; I find most of them so horribly sentimental. I don\u2019t watch it every Christmas. But if I meet somebody new, it would be a first date \u2013 and if they didn\u2019t like it, I would end it. It\u2019s a litmus test. It starts as someone putting on shaving cream, then looking in the mirror, and suddenly they think: \u201cOh my God! I\u2019m Santa Claus.\u201d Well, I like that. That\u2019s a disturbing psychological profile. If you think about it, Santa is a pervert. He sneaks around children\u2019s lives and spies through windows and keeps notes if they\u2019re bad \u2013 that would be getting him arrested today. He slides down your chimney without permission. That\u2019s a home invasion. He eats your food in your house. That\u2019s unsafe. So this movie celebrates the insanity of someone really believing they were Santa Claus. And I love that the children save him at the end, even though he\u2019s killed people, because they believe in him and the adults don\u2019t. This film was actually banned in the UK during the \u201cvideo nasty\u201d panic. This film isn\u2019t nasty. It\u2019s delightful to me. What\u2019s nasty is all the other sentimental Christmas movies that make you gag. They should have the opposite of the nasties \u2013 they should have had a ban on the whimsical. That\u2019s the one I\u2019d join. 7. Carol (Todd Haynes, 2015) Chosen by Mahalia Belo, director of The End We Start From At this time of year, on a cold night, I find myself wanting to be swept up in the world of Carol. There\u2019s something about the intimacy of it, and the Saul Leiter-style cinematography, that brings you completely into its universe rich with desire. It\u2019s about a young woman who sees across the floor of the department store where she works an enigmatic, beautiful woman named Carol. The film, set in the 1950s, explores the connection these women make as the world rattles on and tries to interrupt them. Cate Blanchett, as Carol, beautifully plays a woman trying to find her own space in the world, while not losing everything she loves. It\u2019s very seductive and incredibly well told \u2013 and it\u2019s set at Christmastime. 8. The Snowman (Jimmy T Murakami and Dianne Jackson, 1982) Chosen by Joe Alwyn, star of The Favourite, Conversations With Friends and The Brutalist, out on 24 January I love this film. A boy and his snowman on Christmas Eve. It feels nostalgic and bittersweet. There\u2019s a wonder to it, a dreamlike possibility. Magic, joy, escapism \u2013 but also heartbreak. The painful truth that nothing lasts for ever. Everything melts. Watching the film takes me back to memories of my grandparents, and of sitting by the fire at home. I think of being a boy \u2013 dreaming, longing, needing magic to exist. The version we watched was introduced by David Bowie, and that takes me straight to my mum, and to Life on Mars playing throughout our house. I remember the hand-drawn animation \u2013 a picture book brought to life. And then, of course, the music: Walking in the Air fills the room, hairs prickling, neck tingling, as the boy and his snowman leap into the night sky, hand in hand. It\u2019s a haunting melody and voice; as lonely as it is beautiful. 9. Babes in Toyland (Gus Meins and Charley Rogers, 1934) Chosen by Sean Baker, director of Anora, The Florida Project, and Tangerine This was the holiday movie growing up, or at least my holiday movie. Television stations in the New York area played it on Thanksgiving to get you psyched up for Christmas. It\u2019s a very early example of breaking the fourth wall and the humour is quite modern, though it gets pretty dark and scary. Laurel and Hardy are basically playing themselves in the world of Toyland. There\u2019s an evil businessman in town, Barnaby, who\u2019s reclaiming Mother Peep\u2019s house because she\u2019s failed to pay off her mortgage. He has these boogeymen who he sets on Toyland at the end. It\u2019s the most disturbing thing but also incredibly artistic \u2013 the sets and costumes are amazing. It delivers everything you need for a holiday movie. I saw it many times as a kid, to the point where I actually used Toyland, the song, in Tangerine \u2013 that\u2019s how much of an impact it had on my life. Christmas gives me a break. Anytime the world shuts down for a little bit so I can catch up, that\u2019s what I look forward to. Obviously we all like the family stuff, blah blah blah. Yeah, I\u2019m fine with Christmas. 10. It\u2019s a Wonderful Life (Frank Capra, 1946) Chosen by Gurinder Chadha, director of Bend It Like Beckham and Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging This is my favourite Christmas film because it does everything a holiday movie should do in this season of goodwill to all. It touches you, makes you feel connected to humanity, and takes you on an emotional rollercoaster where you come away appreciating life, love, family and community. Each year I take my kids to watch it on the big screen at the Prince Charles Cinema in Leicester Square with a big bucket of popcorn. When the kids were little they didn\u2019t like that the film was black and white, but now that they\u2019re 17, they enjoy our tradition and understand why every year I\u2019m in tears at the scene when everyone brings whatever savings they have to save the almost ruined George Bailey. I love the film even more because upon release it was considered a flop. How gratifying for me as a film-maker that years later Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart are given the respect they deserve for making an unsurpassed, timeless classic. The film is inspired by Charles Dickens\u2019s A Christmas Carol. I\u2019m currently in the edit room endeavouring to make my own Christmas film. It\u2019s a joyous modern musical where my Scrooge is British Indian and dislikes poor, disenfranchised people. If I can make a film that moves future generations and becomes a holiday tradition like It\u2019s a Wonderful Life, I\u2019ll feel like I\u2019ve taken the spirit of Frank Capra and tried my best to emulate his craft, compassion and heartfelt plea to view life through a lens of gratitude. 11. Miracle in Milan (Vittorio De Sica, 1951) Chosen by Alice Rohrwacher, director of La Chimera, Happy As Lazzaro and 2022 Christmas short Le Pupille This is a sociopolitical fairytale about a boy who is born under a cabbage. He is very poor, but always thinks that everything is possible. There is one scene when all the people try to get some sun in a world that has none, and there is just one ray of sunshine coming out, so they all have to run to it to warm up. And it\u2019s so touching. When I did Le Pupille I was asking myself, what is a Christmas movie? And the difference between a movie and a Christmas movie is that it\u2019s a story with a moral message. In Le Pupille, the moral is \u201cdestiny works in mysterious ways\u201d. The moral of Miracolo a Milano is that, if you change your eyes, things change \u2013 society changes. 12. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Peter Jackson, 2003) Chosen by Himesh Patel, star of Yesterday, Don\u2019t Look Up and Station Eleven When I think of Peter Jackson\u2019s Lord of the Rings trilogy, I think of Christmas. The films were released during the festive period from 2001 to 2003 and became one of the most important cultural touchstones of my generation. Those Christmases held not just the usual festive joys, but the promise of the next chapter in this epic, gamechanging cinematic trilogy. Tolkien\u2019s world filled my head for the entire holiday period. The Return of the King was the culmination, the finale. In my memory, it was all anyone at school was talking about in the lead up to the holidays. It\u2019s not something I watch every Christmas \u2013 convincing my family to sit through three hours and 21 minutes of an epic fantasy film isn\u2019t something I\u2019m silly enough to attempt. Not to mention the first two films or the extended editions\u2026 Generally the festive period now is about catching up on the year\u2019s best films. For me the perfect Christmas film is something that brings the whole family together, takes us through a rollercoaster of emotions and leaves us all tearily hugging one another or jumping for joy. So one day I hope to find myself in the ideal scenario: watching The Return of the King with my wife and my daughters, making our way through a feast of snacks, all trying not to cry when Aragorn says to the hobbits: \u201cMy friends, you bow to no one.\u201d 13. The Holdovers (Alexander Payne, 2023), preceded by the short film Anthony (Jonathan van Tulleken, 2014) Chosen by Jack Thorne, award-winning playwright and screenwriter who co-wrote the animated short An Almost Christmas Story (on Disney+). His adaptation of A Christmas Carol runs until 7 January at the Old Vic, London I think cinema should be made into more of an event again, so this is a petition for the restoration of the short film that comes before the main feature. The one I remember from childhood was Tummy Trouble, with Roger Rabbit, before Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. Both were brilliant. I loved Rick Moranis already, but him combined with Roger? Fantastic. We start with Anthony, a short film of remarkable brutality. The plot is that the sled crash lands and only Santa and a single elf, Anthony, have survived and they have to work out how to save Christmas. I don\u2019t want to spoil too much but reindeers are murdered and then worn and that causes further murder. It\u2019s really funny and brilliant. After the acrid taste of Anthony comes the acrid teacher Paul Hunham in The Holdovers. He is a man who has had his heart ripped out by life. He spends Christmas with a student called Angus, played by Dominic Sessa, and cafeteria manager Mary (Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph). It is a film where little shards of dialogue reveal a gulf of unspoken truth. The end left me both punching the air and crying. It depends who your family are, but mine are mostly self-destructive and will be uplifted by this film, just as they were disgusted by Anthony. 14. Fanny and Alexander (Ingmar Bergman, 1982) Chosen by Richard Eyre, director of Iris, Notes on a Scandal and The Children Act Bergman\u2019s film revolves around two overlapping worlds that fascinate me: the family and the theatre. There\u2019s a Dickensian profligacy in the range of characters in the film but they\u2019re all portrayed with a meticulous humanity worthy of Chekhov: the family saga resonates with realism about life\u2019s compromises. The choreography of the film \u2013 the movement of characters (living and dead), of the camera, of the locations, of the festivities \u2013 is miraculously fresh and inventive. Bergman\u2019s cool draughtsman\u2019s eye combines with his forgiving heart to create extraordinary performances and, for a director who is often castigated for his gloom and sense of mortality, the film is radiant with warmth and fun. 15. Gone With the Wind (Victor Fleming, 1939) Chosen by James Ivory, director of Howards End, The Remains of the Day and The Golden Bowl I must have been 12 when I first watched Gone With the Wind. At the very end Clark Gable says, \u201cFrankly, my dear, I don\u2019t give a damn\u201d, and it was considered so shocking that that word had been used in a family movie. I went to a school that was taught by nuns, and they said: \u201cWhen Clark Gable uses that word, you must cover your ears.\u201d I don\u2019t know how the sisters in the school knew he was going to say that \u2013 they hadn\u2019t seen the movie. Who came and told the nuns that Clark Gable said \u201cdamn\u201d? Of course I didn\u2019t cover my ears. My mother said \u201cdamn\u201d, and so did my father. Sometimes \u201cgoddamn\u201d. Somewhere in the film, there\u2019s a scene where Ashley Wilkes comes home for Christmas from the front, and his wife has knitted him a pair of gloves, and he\u2019s very touched by that. That\u2019s what I remember \u2013 him coming home for Christmas and being given a present by a woman who loves him passionately. It was a very muted scene, with quiet colours \u2013 the colour of a pair of new woollen gloves. 16. The Silent Partner (Daryl Duke, 1978) Chosen by Peter Strickland, director of The Duke of Burgundy, In Fabric and Berberian Sound Studio I was very lucky to enjoy Christmas as a child even if I was bored out of my brains at church \u2013 a double dose with Greek Orthodox followed by Anglican. I love films like A Charlie Brown Christmas and Meet Me in St Louis. But the film that indiscriminately tramples on all festive goodwill is The Silent Partner. Though hardly embodying the Christmas spirit, the film technically takes place during that period. Christopher Plummer, sporting a shocking string vest under his Santa Claus bank robber outfit, portrays a hideously sleazy psycho that I struggle to tally up with his more gentlemanly Captain von Trapp in The Sound of Music. My elder brother and I covertly saw the film late at night on television in the late 80s, but the screaming woke our mum and she stormed downstairs to turn it off. It took more than 20 years to see the rest of the film in its entirety, and I\u2019d concede that my mum had a point, given how terrifying it is. 17. Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (Chris Columbus, 1992) Chosen by Leila Farzad, star of I Hate Suzie, Kaos and Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, out on 14 February Home Alone 2 is the perfect Christmas film because it encapsulates a particular nostalgia that is so cosy and calming to me. When I watch it, it\u2019s 1994 and I\u2019m in my pyjamas, excited about Christmas, fixated on my Advent calendar and full of that pure hygge feeling. I watch it every Christmas without fail sometime around mid-December to ignite the festive feeling. The cast of this film is incredible: Macaulay Culkin at his height, Catherine O\u2019Hara with her exquisite comic timing, Brenda Fricker as the beautifully tragic bird lady, Tim Curry being camp and hysterical, and of course Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci being the best bozo criminals you\u2019ve ever seen. The Christmas films that really give me the feels are often set in 1990s New York where the city feels almost fictitious. It\u2019s skyscrapers, Fifth Avenue, yellow cabs honking, everyone rushing about in great big fur coats holding piles of gifts, steam billowing up from the streets and everyone\u2019s problems are, fundamentally, not actual problems. Ideally I watch it with my family (some of whom groan) on a chilly December evening with the glow of our tree in the corner of the room and me trying not to say all my favourite lines and hum the music. It\u2019s not profound but it sure is Christmassy. 18. The Kid (Charlie Chaplin, 1921) Chosen by Paul King, director of Wonka and the first two Paddington films I love Christmas and London, where I live, is a great Christmas city. When there\u2019s mist illuminated by street lamps, the shops are full of goodies and there\u2019s everything to look forward to, it\u2019s a wonderful time of year. It\u2019s a great moment for families coming together, and what I love most about The Kid is that it\u2019s a very strange family that gets put together. A woman abandons her baby son in the back of a rich person\u2019s car but he ends up in the hands of Charlie Chaplin\u2019s Tramp character, who brings him up without a penny to his name and they form the most deep and beautiful screen relationship I know. It\u2019s heartwarming and incredibly funny and I love its dark twists. I showed it to my daughter aged four or five and she laughed like a drain and howled at the end. It\u2019s a great movie to watch by the fire at Christmas with your family. 19. The Dead Zone (David Cronenberg, 1983) Chosen by Mark Jenkin, director of Bait and Enys Men I\u2019m quite happy watching anything at Christmas \u2013 just sitting down and watching films at 10 o\u2019clock in the morning is such a luxury. I try to tell myself that, because I\u2019m a film director, I can do that, it\u2019s work. This is a film I saw at Christmas when I was probably too young to watch it \u2013 I would have been about nine or 10. I rediscovered it a few years ago and have watched it several times since. It always takes me back to being a kid, at that age when Christmas is still quite magical, which is in complete contrast to the film \u2013 although it is set in the winter, and there is a Christmas scene. They call it a science-fiction thriller, but for me, it\u2019s just a straight-up horror film. Christopher Walken stars as Johnny Smith, a schoolteacher who suffers a near-fatal car accident. He\u2019s in a coma for several years, and when he comes round he\u2019s left with this gift to see into people\u2019s lives if he physically comes into contact with them. He\u2019s able to do some amazing work in terms of helping people out and avoiding disaster, but at the cost of the relationship that he lost. Watching it again in the light of the US election, there\u2019s some interesting parallels. Martin Sheen plays a rightwing populist who\u2019s running for president and might not have the world\u2019s best interests at heart. It\u2019s quite eerie. 20. The Lion in Winter (Anthony Harvey, 1968) Chosen by Maxine Peake, star of Shameless, Peterloo and Funny Cow A stonking melodrama set in the castle of King Henry II on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, 1183, The Lion in Winter is about the interplay between members of a dysfunctional family: jealousy, parental neglect and favouritism, marital infidelity. It may be set in the royal court, but it has red hot flashes of relatability. Christmas in my family has always been a troublesome time of year, so seeing a family dynamic like this writ large is oddly comforting. I adore this film for James Goldman\u2019s rich and knotty screenplay and the two extraordinary and exquisite lead performances of Katharine Hepburn and Peter O\u2019Toole. Watching the chemistry and freedom between these two behemoths of the screen always reduces me to tears, it reminds me why I love my job and always spurs me on to try harder and be better in the new year to come. It\u2019s a day after Boxing Day, late afternoon\u2026 I get the fire on, make myself a snowball (eggnog and ginger ale) and settle down on the sofa with my husband and dog\u2026 It\u2019s that kind of film. 21. Bad Day at Black Rock (John Sturges, 1955) Chosen by Daniel Kokotajlo, director of Apostasy and Starve Acre I\u2019ve got a weird relationship with Christmas because it was sort of taken away from me when I was very young. My family became Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, so I didn\u2019t celebrate for a large period of my life. But since I met my partner, whose family are avid Christmas lovers, I celebrate now, and I love it. I always watch ghost stories on the BBC on Christmas Eve, and then on Christmas Day I\u2019ll watch something that\u2019s a classic, that transports you, and Black Rock does that for me. It\u2019s a genre-bending film: part western, part noir thriller, part horror movie, part war movie with a message. It\u2019s about this lonely figure who turns up in the west in this small town, where everybody is very hostile to him, and he\u2019s looking for someone who has disappeared. It\u2019s got themes of resilience in it, and redemption; there\u2019s nostalgia running through it. Spencer Tracy\u2019s amazing in it: his character isn\u2019t a hero in the traditional sense \u2013 he\u2019s disabled and unsure of himself, but represents a compassion and dedication to truth that still resonates with me today. It\u2019s a great film. It\u2019s got an uplifting feel that\u2019s perfect for Christmas, but it\u2019s probably more suited to those who enjoy a bit of darkness and suspense in their holiday viewing. 22. Dean Spanley (Toa Fraser, 2008) Chosen by Gillian Anderson, star of The X Files, Sex Education and Scoop I love this offbeat tear-jerker of a comedic tale and have recommended it for years. It\u2019s fantastic to watch at Christmas with family for its snowy scenes and cosy interiors. But also, because it\u2019s a whimsical and profoundly moving exploration of the relationships between father and son and\u2026 master and dog. Set in Edwardian England immediately after the Boer war, the elderly, self-obsessed and offensively bigoted Horatio Fisk (Peter O\u2019Toole) struggles to deal with his eldest son\u2019s death in the war as well as the subsequent death of his grieving wife. His remaining son, Henslowe (Jeremy Northam), is beholden to his cantankerous father and tries tirelessly to console him during his reluctant weekly Thursday visits, but simply cannot win his love. But through chance encounters with a curious local Dean (Sam Neill), Henslowe and his mischievous mate Wrather (Bryan Brown), lure the dean to a series of surreal dinners where he begins to recount curious remembrances of his past life that inadvertently leads to the elder Fisk finding his heart. The film is wonderfully directed by Toa Fraser, with astonishingly good performances, and has one of my favourite scores of all time by Don McGlashan. It\u2019s just delightful and I challenge anyone who has ever struggled with a parental relationship, or ever loved a dog, not to weep during some of the later scenes. 23. Song of the Sea (Tomm Moore, 2014) Chosen by Jamie Demetriou, star of Stath Lets Flats, Fleabag and Barbie To avoid being the 1,000th person to choose The Muppet Christmas Carol, my pick is this exquisite Irish animated feature. Christmas family time is lovely, in a way, sure. But my most treasured Christmas tradition is the precious two to 10 hours I get to spend alone in my bedroom on Christmas Eve wrapping presents, watching Song of the Sea on my laptop. It is the most lovingly crafted film: every character, setting and texture oozing with a bygone truth and warmth that only the magic of 2D animation can conjure. It isn\u2019t the most traditionally Christmassy film in the world \u2013 it\u2019s about the children of a grieving lighthouse keeper and some mythical Irish seals \u2013 but to me Christmas is largely about feeling warm despite the cold, and this film is a hot-water bottle when the heating\u2019s broken. 24. Miracle on 34th Street (George Seaton, 1947) Chosen by Carol Morley, director of The Falling, Dreams of a Life, and Typist Artist Pirate King If I saw that Miracle on 34th Street was on the telly, I\u2019d have to stop whatever I was doing and watch. The film takes me back to when I knew Father Christmas existed. This all ended when I was six and my brother Paul, nine years older than me, told me he didn\u2019t exist. I acted cool, but inside I was devastated. Santa was better than believing in Jesus: Santa brought you presents! I love that Miracle on 34th Street is about putting the real Santa on trial for lunacy, and explores commercialism and what it is to believe in something. I adore young Natalie Wood as the cynical child who finds her imagination, and Maureen O\u2019Hara as her single mother struggling with her broken dreams. Edmund Gwenn\u2019s benign but feisty Father Christmas is perfect in every way: he says \u201cChristmas isn\u2019t just a day, it\u2019s a frame of mind\u201d. And I look for a film that can transport me to times of hope, where we can all believe in miracles. Interviews by Kathryn Bromwich &amp; Killian Fox",

There must be few people who mean more to Adams.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve sat with him for the last six months but he\u2019s died of lung cancer,\u201d says Adams. \u201cOh, there you go, I\u2019m getting a bit emotional. I\u2019m getting a bit of closure around it. The funeral [was] on Wednesday. He saved my life, and got hundreds of other people clean.\u201d The road to meeting James W in 1996 was bleak. Despite Adams\u2019 continued excellence on the pitch, his drinking escalated out of control. One fall down some stairs required 29 stitches in his forehead (the same forehead that weeks later would score the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jan/03/arsenal-tottenham-north-london-derby-fa-cup#:~:text=4%20April%201993%2C%20Semi%2Dfinal,few%20minds%2C%20that's%20for%20sure.\">winner against Tottenham in the 1993 FA Cup semi-final</a>).</p> <p>\u201cThe blackouts happened more and more,\u201d says Adams. \u201cI met my first wife [Jane Shea] in a blackout. I put her into rehab because she took crack and I surrounded myself with sick people to prop me up. I thought all my problems were her fault \u2013 I had the banner of being England captain. But I was the one wearing myself out. I was the one being unfaithful.</p> <p>\u201cIn 1996, I was 29 years of age and didn\u2019t want to be on the planet, so it was a very dark period of my life. When I didn\u2019t play football, I didn\u2019t want to live. I couldn\u2019t do life. I knew I was completely trapped and that\u2019s the worst place I\u2019ve ever been in. In February of that year, football was removed as I got injured. In March, my kids were removed. I didn\u2019t drink around them but passed out one Sunday evening. I drank seven bottles of chablis. So the mother-in-law took the kids.</p>    <p>\u201cMy father-in-law then was Frank Shea. He used to drive for the Krays; Frances was his sister, who married Reggie Kray. So that was the kind of background for my first wife\u2019s state. But Frank, all of a sudden, he\u2019s 10 years without a drink or drugs, and he\u2019s got his self-respect back, and he\u2019s got his dignity back. All the things that I\u2019d lost. So Barbara, my [first] mother-in-law, gave me James W\u2019s number. She slipped it in my pocket. She saved my life.\u201d</p> <p>Adams first met James W in April 1996, drunk. \u201cThen we had the Euros, and I managed to stay clean and sober using football. But as soon as Gareth [Southgate] missed that penalty, the booze was in my hand again, a 44-day bender. At the end of my drinking, I\u2019ve seen things come out of the cupboard. I was paranoid. I thought someone was in the house. I thought I was killing people.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I came around 16 August 1996, James guided me and I went to <a href=\"https://www.alcoholics-anonymous.org.uk/\">Alcoholics Anonymous</a>, went through the 12 steps with him and it changed me as a human being.\u201d</p> <p>This has been a big week for Adams. The day after James W\u2019s funeral he was named as the chair of the national <a href=\"https://www.forwardtrust.org.uk/news-story/tony-adams-appointed-as-new-chair-of-national-addiction-and-recovery-charity-the-forward-trust/\">addiction and recovery charity The Forward Trust</a>. His connection with the trust goes back to 1996, when he first visited its rehabilitation clinic in Wiltshire.</p>    <p>The trust\u2019s work, particularly in prisons working with offenders, resonates with Adams, who was given a four-month sentence in 1990 for drink-driving. \u201cI was in there because I was four times over the legal limit. I went straight across an A road, doing 80mph, out of control for the length of a football pitch, and rightly so, ended up in prison because of that.\u201d</p> <p>The reaction to his sentence did little to help. Family and friends refused to condemn Adams\u2019 behaviour. \u201cI got pats on the back,\u201d says Adams. \u201cI was Arsenal captain and my manager [George Graham] said: \u2018Oh, they\u2019re making an example of you. It\u2019s 19 December. You\u2019re the best advert out there for not drinking and driving this Christmas.\u2019 It\u2019s all bullshit, to be honest with you.\u201d</p> <p>After two months inside, fans and teammates celebrated Adams\u2019 return to Arsenal, who would go on to clinch the title that season, backing up their championship victory in 1989.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/17/jari-litmanen-on-ajax-barca-and-a-wrist-that-broke-into-eight-pieces\">Jari Litmanen on Ajax, Bar\u00e7a and a wrist that \u2018broke into eight pieces\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI was talented and I kept getting away with it,\u201d Adams says. \u201cMy ego was going up and up and up and my self-esteem was coming down and down. After prison, I kept on drinking for six years. The insanity is not to go into the prison and drive over a wall and into someone\u2019s front garden. The insanity is getting your licence back and then within days, drinking and driving again. I didn\u2019t need prison; it didn\u2019t touch the sides. I needed rehab. There was no 12-step programme in prison. There were no education programmes, no nothing. Chelmsford prison was a bucket in the corner.\u201d</p> <p>Adams stopped drinking just before the arrival at Arsenal of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, for whom he remained a stalwart. Adams was so devoted to his new sobriety that he drank 27 cappuccinos at a Christmas party, matching his teammates\u2019 pints, drink for drink.</p> <p>Adams captained Arsenal to the Double in 1998, the abiding image of that season coming on the Premier League\u2019s final day when Adams made a rare foray forward before <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8RUfQDBYBfk?si=fbFEWFIuIWjRpS07&amp;amp;t=83\">smashing a left-foot shot into the corner</a> to seal a win over Everton and the title. His iconic celebration has been immortalised in a statue outside the Emirates. In a stadium of noise and clamour, he is a picture of tranquillity. \u201cI saw the serenity in James W, and wanted that,\u201d the former defender says.</p> <p>Adams signed off his playing career in 2002 with another league title and FA Cup before brief stints in management at Wycombe, Portsmouth, Granada and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/04/tony-adams-heart-surgery-azerbaijan-gabala-arsenal\">Gabala in Azerbaijan, where he nearly had a fatal heart issue</a>. \u201cMy main artery was 99% blocked. I\u2019m only here because the Ukrainian doctor there put a couple of stents in.\u201d But battling addiction is Adams\u2019 sole purpose now.</p> <p>\u201cI walk the walk today. I\u2019m fully recovered but still go to regular meetings, and go to three, four prisons a year, passing the message on to the newcomer that help is out there.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 For more information about The Forward Trust please visit <a href=\"https://www.forwardtrust.org.uk/\">https://www.forwardtrust.org.uk/</a>.</em></p> <p>\u2022 In the UK and Ireland, <a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org/\">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

I\u2019m comfortable in my own skin for the first time in my life. I\u2019ve grown up. There are no tentacles from the past now.\u201d In the hour that we speak, the only tears fall for a man known only as James W, hailed by the 58-year-old as his \u201chero, therapist, sponsor, mentor\u201d, who started Adams\u2019 road to recovery in 1996 after years of addiction, and ran Adams\u2019 charity, Sporting Chance, for 20 years as the clinical director. There must be few people who mean more to Adams. \u201cI\u2019ve sat with him for the last six months but he\u2019s died of lung cancer,\u201d says Adams. \u201cOh, there you go, I\u2019m getting a bit emotional. I\u2019m getting a bit of closure around it. The funeral [was] on Wednesday. He saved my life, and got hundreds of other people clean.\u201d The road to meeting James W in 1996 was bleak. Despite Adams\u2019 continued excellence on the pitch, his drinking escalated out of control. One fall down some stairs required 29 stitches in his forehead (the same forehead that weeks later would score the winner against Tottenham in the 1993 FA Cup semi-final). \u201cThe blackouts happened more and more,\u201d says Adams. \u201cI met my first wife [Jane Shea] in a blackout. I put her into rehab because she took crack and I surrounded myself with sick people to prop me up. I thought all my problems were her fault \u2013 I had the banner of being England captain. But I was the one wearing myself out. I was the one being unfaithful. \u201cIn 1996, I was 29 years of age and didn\u2019t want to be on the planet, so it was a very dark period of my life. When I didn\u2019t play football, I didn\u2019t want to live. I couldn\u2019t do life. I knew I was completely trapped and that\u2019s the worst place I\u2019ve ever been in. In February of that year, football was removed as I got injured. In March, my kids were removed. I didn\u2019t drink around them but passed out one Sunday evening. I drank seven bottles of chablis. So the mother-in-law took the kids. \u201cMy father-in-law then was Frank Shea. He used to drive for the Krays; Frances was his sister, who married Reggie Kray. So that was the kind of background for my first wife\u2019s state. But Frank, all of a sudden, he\u2019s 10 years without a drink or drugs, and he\u2019s got his self-respect back, and he\u2019s got his dignity back. All the things that I\u2019d lost. So Barbara, my [first] mother-in-law, gave me James W\u2019s number. She slipped it in my pocket. She saved my life.\u201d Adams first met James W in April 1996, drunk. \u201cThen we had the Euros, and I managed to stay clean and sober using football. But as soon as Gareth [Southgate] missed that penalty, the booze was in my hand again, a 44-day bender. At the end of my drinking, I\u2019ve seen things come out of the cupboard. I was paranoid. I thought someone was in the house. I thought I was killing people. \u201cWhen I came around 16 August 1996, James guided me and I went to Alcoholics Anonymous, went through the 12 steps with him and it changed me as a human being.\u201d This has been a big week for Adams. The day after James W\u2019s funeral he was named as the chair of the national addiction and recovery charity The Forward Trust. His connection with the trust goes back to 1996, when he first visited its rehabilitation clinic in Wiltshire. The trust\u2019s work, particularly in prisons working with offenders, resonates with Adams, who was given a four-month sentence in 1990 for drink-driving. \u201cI was in there because I was four times over the legal limit. I went straight across an A road, doing 80mph, out of control for the length of a football pitch, and rightly so, ended up in prison because of that.\u201d The reaction to his sentence did little to help. Family and friends refused to condemn Adams\u2019 behaviour. \u201cI got pats on the back,\u201d says Adams. \u201cI was Arsenal captain and my manager [George Graham] said: \u2018Oh, they\u2019re making an example of you. It\u2019s 19 December. You\u2019re the best advert out there for not drinking and driving this Christmas.\u2019 It\u2019s all bullshit, to be honest with you.\u201d After two months inside, fans and teammates celebrated Adams\u2019 return to Arsenal, who would go on to clinch the title that season, backing up their championship victory in 1989. \u201cI was talented and I kept getting away with it,\u201d Adams says. \u201cMy ego was going up and up and up and my self-esteem was coming down and down. After prison, I kept on drinking for six years. The insanity is not to go into the prison and drive over a wall and into someone\u2019s front garden. The insanity is getting your licence back and then within days, drinking and driving again. I didn\u2019t need prison; it didn\u2019t touch the sides. I needed rehab. There was no 12-step programme in prison. There were no education programmes, no nothing. Chelmsford prison was a bucket in the corner.\u201d Adams stopped drinking just before the arrival at Arsenal of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, for whom he remained a stalwart. Adams was so devoted to his new sobriety that he drank 27 cappuccinos at a Christmas party, matching his teammates\u2019 pints, drink for drink. Adams captained Arsenal to the Double in 1998, the abiding image of that season coming on the Premier League\u2019s final day when Adams made a rare foray forward before smashing a left-foot shot into the corner to seal a win over Everton and the title. His iconic celebration has been immortalised in a statue outside the Emirates. In a stadium of noise and clamour, he is a picture of tranquillity. \u201cI saw the serenity in James W, and wanted that,\u201d the former defender says. Adams signed off his playing career in 2002 with another league title and FA Cup before brief stints in management at Wycombe, Portsmouth, Granada and Gabala in Azerbaijan, where he nearly had a fatal heart issue. \u201cMy main artery was 99% blocked. I\u2019m only here because the Ukrainian doctor there put a couple of stents in.\u201d But battling addiction is Adams\u2019 sole purpose now. \u201cI walk the walk today. I\u2019m fully recovered but still go to regular meetings, and go to three, four prisons a year, passing the message on to the newcomer that help is out there.\u201d \u2022 For more information about The Forward Trust please visit https://www.forwardtrust.org.uk/. \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

It\u2019s now up to Cromwell to stay in position by finding Henry a new queen. But Cromwell is haunted by his bitter conversation with Cardinal Wolsey\u2019s daughter: \u201cIt has undone me, her accusation [of betrayal], I have lost my way.\u201d Hollie Richardson Asia 6.20pm, BBC One The sweeping nature documentary is particularly powerful this week, showing how animals and humans coexist in crowded spaces, with deer joining commuters every day. An urban tiger mother hunts for food against the backdrop of city lights, but the highlight is a brazen elephant who has learned to stop the traffic to hustle drivers for bananas. Hannah Verdier Perfect Pub Walks With Bill Bailey 7pm, Channel 4 Singer Shaun Ryder is Bill Bailey\u2019s final walking companion in the uplifting series, and the pair take a stroll in Somerset across the Avalon Marshes, Chew Valley and Ham Hill. Shaun reflects on his hedonistic younger years, what happened when he received an ADHD diagnosis at age 50 and the different sorts of highs he now gets from life. HR All Aboard! Scotland\u2019s Poshest Train 8pm, Channel 4 \u201cWhat a magnificent organ!\u201d A summer of luxury living on the Royal Scotsman has clearly not dulled Alan Cumming\u2019s wicked wit, as he demonstrates during a visit to historic Scone Palace near Perth. His final railway itinerary also includes a side voyage to the island of Iona and an encounter with his own portrait at V&amp;A Dundee. Graeme Virtue Inside Barlinnie 10pm, BBC Two First shown on BBC Scotland, this is an insightful look at the notorious Barlinnie prison, which at one point is described as being \u201calmost like Glasgow\u2019s Guant\u00e1namo Bay\u201d. But as it prepares to close after 142 years, with a super-prison taking its place, inmates and staff examine the justice system and ask if there is the potential to change lives. HR Sorry, I Didn\u2019t Know 10.50pm, ITV1 We\u2019re used to seeing Chizzy Akudolu on the panel, but she sits in Jimmy Akingbola\u2019s hosting hot seat this week, to offer up educational titbits ranging from the anti-colonial legacy of Patrice Lumumba to why Black don\u2019t crack \u2013 \u201cunless you smoke it\u201d. Plus guests Richard Blackwood and Bridgerton\u2019s Adjoa Andoh. Ellen E Jones Film choice The American Society of Magical Negroes, 8.35am, 5.10pm, Sky Cinema Premiere A magical negro here is a \u201cBlack supporting character who exists solely to serve a white protagonist\u2019s storyline\u201d. In this satirical romcom, failed artist Aren (Justice Smith) is recruited to the titular secret group (with nods to Harry Potter) and assigned to boost the self-worth of Drew Tarver\u2019s tech startup worker Jason, which includes hooking him up \u2013 Cyrano-style \u2013 with co-worker Lizzie (An-Li Bogan). If he doesn\u2019t, levels of \u201cwhite discomfort\u201d could lead to the loss of the society\u2019s magic powers \u2013 and racial violence.

      "body": "<p>The humpback whales watched by Paul Watson from his prison cell this summer have long since migrated from the iceberg-flecked Nuup Kangerlua fjord to warmer seas. It is over four months since Watson \u2013 an eco-terrorist to some and a brave environmentalist to others \u2013 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/15/sea-shepherd-founder-paul-watson-to-remain-detained-in-greenland-anti-whaling-japan-extradition\">brought here to Anstalten</a>, a high-security jail perched on the frozen coast of south-east Greenland after being arrested while refuelling his ship, MV John Paul DeJoria, in nearby Nuuk, the capital of the autonomous Danish territory.</p> <p>He had been on his way with a 32-strong crew to practise his decades-long policy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/26/sea-shepherd-captain-paul-watson-i-call-what-we-do-aggressive-non-violence\">\u201cnon-violent aggression\u201d</a> by intercepting a new Japanese whaling \u201cmothership\u201d, the \u00a57.5bn ($47.4m) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/may/02/japan-whale-meat-industry-kangei-maru-mother-ship\">Kangei Maru</a>. But shortly after tying up his vessel in the harbour \u201ca nice police car turned up\u201d and 12 armed officers boarded.</p> <p>It was to prove the opening of just the latest, but perhaps the most dramatic, chapter yet in the story of Watson\u2019s running battles on the high seas with the whalers of Japan. The Japanese government initially used a \u201cresearch\u201d loophole to circumvent a 1986 International Whaling Commission moratorium on hunts in international waters, and then withdrew from the IWC entirely in order to continue commercial hunting within its own exclusive economic zone. Now, it is said to retain a desire to expand again.</p>    <p>\u201cI was sitting in the captain\u2019s chair at the time, and one of them just walked up, grabbed me by the shirt, pulled me off the chair and turned me around and handcuffed me,\u201d Watson says of his arrest in Nuuk harbour. \u201cAnd I said: \u2018What\u2019s this for?\u2019 And they said: \u2018You\u2019ll find out\u2019 and took me down to the police station. They weren\u2019t a very friendly bunch.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/22/paul-watson-arrested-greenland-sea-shepherd-founder-and-anti-whaling-activist\">arrest on 21 July</a> had been prompted by an Interpol red notice issued by Japan whose government accuses Watson of conspiracy to trespass, interrupt a business and cause <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jan/06/sea-shepherd-adygil-japan-whalers\">damage to the Shonan Maru 2</a> whaling ship in 2010 in the Antarctic \u2013 but also, crucially, to lightly injure a Japanese crew member via the mild acid from a stink bomb.</p> <p>He was not at the scene of the alleged crime and denies playing any commanding role in it, but on Monday Watson is expecting to mark his 74th birthday by being told by a judge that his detention in Greenland will be extended by at least another month as the Ministry of Justice in Copenhagen continues to weigh up a Japanese demand for his extradition on charges that could see him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/31/sea-shepherd-founder-anti-whaling-activist-paul-watson-arrest-japan-ntwnfb\">jailed for up to 15 years</a>.

My mother died when I was 13. My father was extremely abusive. So I didn\u2019t really have that kind of, you know, happy childhood in that way. But that made me committed to making sure that my children are taken care of in every sense.\u201d His wife, Yana, 43, worries. \u201cShe tends to be a little more emotional than most,\u201d he says with a dry laugh. \u201cShe\u2019s OK. She does get a little dramatic sometimes\u201d.</p>    <p>Watson, a joint US-Canadian citizen, was born in Toronto but grew up in St Andrews, New Brunswick. His response to physical abuse from his father was to throw himself into the Kindness Club, an animal welfare organisation founded by Aida Flemming, the wife of New Brunswick premier Hugh John Flemming. It was a temporary fix. \u201cI ran away from home when I was 14, 15, 16, and finally, permanently, I ran off to sea. I joined the Norwegian Merchant Marine,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Watson does not describe himself as a protester. He regards himself as an enforcer of international treaties on whaling and animal welfare. He proudly states that his work has never hurt anyone but it has involved him putting his body in the way of harm. His crews would be asked whether they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jan/09/dying-whale-greenpeace-paul-watson\">were willing to lose their life to save that of a whale</a>. \u201cAnd if they said no, then I said: \u2018Well, then we don\u2019t need you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It has also involved the scuttling of whaling boats in the past.

      "bodyText": "The humpback whales watched by Paul Watson from his prison cell this summer have long since migrated from the iceberg-flecked Nuup Kangerlua fjord to warmer seas. It is over four months since Watson \u2013 an eco-terrorist to some and a brave environmentalist to others \u2013 was brought here to Anstalten, a high-security jail perched on the frozen coast of south-east Greenland after being arrested while refuelling his ship, MV John Paul DeJoria, in nearby Nuuk, the capital of the autonomous Danish territory. He had been on his way with a 32-strong crew to practise his decades-long policy of \u201cnon-violent aggression\u201d by intercepting a new Japanese whaling \u201cmothership\u201d, the \u00a57.5bn ($47.4m) Kangei Maru. But shortly after tying up his vessel in the harbour \u201ca nice police car turned up\u201d and 12 armed officers boarded. It was to prove the opening of just the latest, but perhaps the most dramatic, chapter yet in the story of Watson\u2019s running battles on the high seas with the whalers of Japan. The Japanese government initially used a \u201cresearch\u201d loophole to circumvent a 1986 International Whaling Commission moratorium on hunts in international waters, and then withdrew from the IWC entirely in order to continue commercial hunting within its own exclusive economic zone. Now, it is said to retain a desire to expand again. \u201cI was sitting in the captain\u2019s chair at the time, and one of them just walked up, grabbed me by the shirt, pulled me off the chair and turned me around and handcuffed me,\u201d Watson says of his arrest in Nuuk harbour. \u201cAnd I said: \u2018What\u2019s this for?\u2019 And they said: \u2018You\u2019ll find out\u2019 and took me down to the police station. They weren\u2019t a very friendly bunch.\u201d The arrest on 21 July had been prompted by an Interpol red notice issued by Japan whose government accuses Watson of conspiracy to trespass, interrupt a business and cause damage to the Shonan Maru 2 whaling ship in 2010 in the Antarctic \u2013 but also, crucially, to lightly injure a Japanese crew member via the mild acid from a stink bomb. He was not at the scene of the alleged crime and denies playing any commanding role in it, but on Monday Watson is expecting to mark his 74th birthday by being told by a judge that his detention in Greenland will be extended by at least another month as the Ministry of Justice in Copenhagen continues to weigh up a Japanese demand for his extradition on charges that could see him jailed for up to 15 years. And so Watson, a grandfather, and father of two young children, finds himself here, long after the whales have left, talking from a spare cell that is acting as a visitors\u2019 room. Anstalten was opened in 2021 by the Greenland government as a \u201chumane\u201d alternative to sending the territory\u2019s most serious criminals 1,800 miles south-east to Denmark.

      "body": "<p>Whatever you say about it, don\u2019t call it a relaunch. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/30/starmer-to-pledge-cuts-to-nhs-waiting-lists-and-in-major-reset-for-labour\">Sir Keir Starmer will fanfare a new \u201cPlan for Change\u201d this Thursday</a> and it is being bigged up by Downing Street as a momentous event, no less than \u201cthe most ambitious delivery plan in a generation\u201d. His aides are wary of the dreaded r-word because many observers are going to interpret this, fairly or not, as a desperate attempt to turn the page on&nbsp;recent&nbsp;troubles.</p> <p>It is a truth now pretty much universally acknowledged within the government that it has got off to a much stickier start than it expected. In too many areas, it has hit the ground not running, but stumbling. More definition of Labour\u2019s goals was provided by the budget, but at the price of rousing a lot of extremely vocal opposition, especially from those being asked to pay more tax. The latest squall to buffet Number 10 has been the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/29/louise-haigh-told-to-quit-by-no-10-over-possible-breach-of-ministerial-code\">enforced resignation of Lou Haigh</a>. She could never be described as a soulmate of the prime minister, which helps explain the clinically unsentimental way in which the transport secretary was taken out of service. Losing a relatively junior member of the cabinet will have next to no impact on Labour\u2019s eventual fate. Her fall nevertheless adds to the impression that the Starmer government is being serially surprised by embarrassing revelations and knocked about by events.</p> <p>Another concern within Number 10 is that the impassioned debate over assisted dying has been a diversion from framing the government\u2019s core agenda and presenting it to the public. While no-one in Downing Street will deny that this is a hugely important issue, and Friday\u2019s Commons <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/29/mps-vote-for-assisted-dying-in-england-and-wales\">vote towards legalisation</a> a historic step, it is also recognised at Number 10 that it has not been a great look to have had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/23/uk-justice-secretary-attacks-assisted-dying-bill-as-state-death-service\">cabinet ministers scrapping about it</a> with each other in public.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The case against them, especially if they are poorly chosen, is that targets become not a spur to performance but a distraction</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So one purpose of this week\u2019s prime ministerial event that you mustn\u2019t call a relaunch is to demonstrate that he has a firm focus and tight grip on the domestic agenda. That\u2019s also because, since he arrived at Number 10, there have been many days when Sir Keir has been absent from the building on trips overseas. Downing Street is perturbed to hear that voters in focus groups have started remarking that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/17/keir-starmer-time-abroad-prime-minister\">Starmer always seems to be abroad.</a>\u201d I\u2019m told that the prime minister himself has been heard to get off planes groaning about how many air miles he has clocked up.</p> <p>Within the building, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/23/keir-starmer-slavery-reparations-commonwealth-summit\">long round-trip to Samoa</a> at the end of October for the Commonwealth summit is seen as a particularly unproductive use of his time. Truth to tell, he has not had much choice about this. Not flying to the Pacific for the Commonwealth summit&nbsp;would have aggravated those who did go. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/25/king-charles-samoa-visit-speech-commonwealth-summit\">King&nbsp;Charles would not have been amused</a>. Dates in the diary&nbsp;for international summits are non-negotiable and&nbsp;a new prime minister had to introduce himself to his global peer group. But it has accentuated the feeling&nbsp;among his team that he needs to show he\u2019s at&nbsp;home deploying all of Number 10\u2019s firepower to make&nbsp;things happen.</p> <p>The \u201cPlan for Change\u201d will add detail to what Labour hopes to have achieved by the time of the next election and it will unveil new goals linked to the \u201cfive missions\u201d. This is an acknowledgement that its future fortunes are inextricably linked to whether it can improve living standards and public services, as well as levels of voter satisfaction with both.</p> <p>Targets to be announced by Sir Keir will include, I\u2019m told, ones covering attainment levels among schoolchildren, crime rates and bringing down waiting times for NHS treatment. There was originally a plan to launch a publicly available performance \u201cdashboard\u201d, but that has been abandoned as unfeasible. What we will be promised are metrics by which voters can measure progress towards \u201cdelivery milestones\u201d. All of which comes with upsides and downsides.</p> <p>There is a case for a carefully selected number of properly focussed targets. Done well, these can provide stars for government departments to steer by, and prompts to energise ministers and their officials. One cabinet member argues: \u201cEven if you don\u2019t fully achieve them, if you get 80% to 90% of the way there, you\u2019ve done better than you would have done if you didn\u2019t have&nbsp;a&nbsp;target.\u201d</p> <p>The case against them, especially if they are poorly chosen or if there are too many of them, is that targets become not a spur to performance but a distraction, which distorts activity in a damaging way. One political peril is that Sir Keir\u2019s goals will be derided as unambitious if the bar is set too low. Aides are adamant that this won\u2019t be the case. \u201cThe targets are designed to be very stretching,\u201d says one. \u201cThis is supposed to concentrate minds across government.\u201d If the goals are genuinely demanding, the hazard is that they become hostages to future fortune. His opponents and hostile elements of the media will ignore any successes and crow over any failures.</p> <p>The prime minister will be putting himself very visibly in charge of delivery on Thursday. This is in part the result of a view within Number 10 that the effort to make good on the missions has been too sluggish to date and now needs to be driven harder and faster.</p> <p>There\u2019s fear that change simply won\u2019t happen if the job is left to clunky committees of ministers and civil servants. Note also the reconfiguration of the personnel and the philosophy at Number 10 since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/06/sue-gray-resigns-as-keir-starmer-chief-of-staff-downing-street\">removal of Sue Gray as chief of staff</a> after just 92 days in post.</p> <p>Morgan McSweeney, the architect of Labour\u2019s election campaign who supplanted her as chief of staff, is bringing a much more political edge to the job than the former civil servant he replaced. Colleagues report that he is ferociously obsessed with what he thinks Labour has to get done to win a second term. Jonathan Powell, who was chief of staff during Tony Blair\u2019s time as prime minister, has been made national security adviser. Mr&nbsp;Powell has told me in the past that one of his greatest regrets about the Blair government is that it didn\u2019t put&nbsp;much more effort into improving the machinery of&nbsp;government.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sir-michael-barber-appointed-as-adviser-to-the-prime-minister\">Sir Michael Barber</a> and Liz Lloyd, both staffers during the Blair years, have been brought in with briefs to make domestic reform effective \u2013 which they are doing in concert with Pat McFadden, also a New Labour veteran, who is the minister in charge of the work on the missions being done by the Cabinet Office.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Voters hold the person at the top responsible for the performance of the government as a whole</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cSue\u2019s view was that the centre needed to be weaker and the departments needed to be stronger,\u201d says a person highly familiar with Number 10\u2019s thinking. \u201cBut there is no substitute for having a strong centre if you want to drive change.\u201d During Ms Gray\u2019s time, cabinet ministers were encouraged to think of themselves as semi-autonomous entities. The regime now in place believes that vigorous reform will simply not happen unless Downing Street asserts itself by forcing ministers and officials to think outside their departmental boxes. Peter Hyman, one of the principal architects of the programme, has published a <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/the-weekend-essay/2024/11/keir-starmer-must-remember-his-mission\">punchy piece contending that much of the civil service simply doesn\u2019t get the missions</a> and that permanent secretaries are resisting the use of outside expertise. He urges Sir Keir to appoint \u201ca radical reformer\u201d as the next cabinet secretary. A different ally suggests that the \u201cPlan for Change\u201d is the result of the prime&nbsp;minister realising \u201chow difficult it is to renose the Whitehall machine in the direction that you&nbsp;want to take it\u201d.</p> <p>So Thursday\u2019s big event is not just aimed at the public. It is also designed to be an electric jolt to Whitehall to get with the programme. The external story will try to convey to voters what Labour hopes to achieve over the course of this parliament. The internal one, in the words of one cabinet member, is about injecting a lot more urgency into the civil service by \u201cgalvanising Whitehall and getting it to focus on the government\u2019s priorities\u201d.</p> <p>The prime minister will be pinning his reputation to delivery this week. Another way of putting it is to say that he is acknowledging the reality of presidential modern politics. Voters hold the man (or woman) at the top responsible for the performance of the government as a whole. Since that can\u2019t be ducked, it might as well be embraced, risks and all. Because if he can\u2019t produce the change he\u2019s promising, Sir Keir\u2019s \u201cdelivery milestones\u201d will be hung around his neck.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

      "bodyText": "Whatever you say about it, don\u2019t call it a relaunch. Sir Keir Starmer will fanfare a new \u201cPlan for Change\u201d this Thursday and it is being bigged up by Downing Street as a momentous event, no less than \u201cthe most ambitious delivery plan in a generation\u201d. His aides are wary of the dreaded r-word because many observers are going to interpret this, fairly or not, as a desperate attempt to turn the page on recent troubles. It is a truth now pretty much universally acknowledged within the government that it has got off to a much stickier start than it expected. In too many areas, it has hit the ground not running, but stumbling. More definition of Labour\u2019s goals was provided by the budget, but at the price of rousing a lot of extremely vocal opposition, especially from those being asked to pay more tax. The latest squall to buffet Number 10 has been the enforced resignation of Lou Haigh. She could never be described as a soulmate of the prime minister, which helps explain the clinically unsentimental way in which the transport secretary was taken out of service. Losing a relatively junior member of the cabinet will have next to no impact on Labour\u2019s eventual fate. Her fall nevertheless adds to the impression that the Starmer government is being serially surprised by embarrassing revelations and knocked about by events. Another concern within Number 10 is that the impassioned debate over assisted dying has been a diversion from framing the government\u2019s core agenda and presenting it to the public. While no-one in Downing Street will deny that this is a hugely important issue, and Friday\u2019s Commons vote towards legalisation a historic step, it is also recognised at Number 10 that it has not been a great look to have had cabinet ministers scrapping about it with each other in public. So one purpose of this week\u2019s prime ministerial event that you mustn\u2019t call a relaunch is to demonstrate that he has a firm focus and tight grip on the domestic agenda. That\u2019s also because, since he arrived at Number 10, there have been many days when Sir Keir has been absent from the building on trips overseas. Downing Street is perturbed to hear that voters in focus groups have started remarking that \u201cStarmer always seems to be abroad.\u201d I\u2019m told that the prime minister himself has been heard to get off planes groaning about how many air miles he has clocked up. Within the building, the long round-trip to Samoa at the end of October for the Commonwealth summit is seen as a particularly unproductive use of his time. Truth to tell, he has not had much choice about this. Not flying to the Pacific for the Commonwealth summit would have aggravated those who did go. King Charles would not have been amused. Dates in the diary for international summits are non-negotiable and a new prime minister had to introduce himself to his global peer group. But it has accentuated the feeling among his team that he needs to show he\u2019s at home deploying all of Number 10\u2019s firepower to make things happen. The \u201cPlan for Change\u201d will add detail to what Labour hopes to have achieved by the time of the next election and it will unveil new goals linked to the \u201cfive missions\u201d. This is an acknowledgement that its future fortunes are inextricably linked to whether it can improve living standards and public services, as well as levels of voter satisfaction with both. Targets to be announced by Sir Keir will include, I\u2019m told, ones covering attainment levels among schoolchildren, crime rates and bringing down waiting times for NHS treatment. There was originally a plan to launch a publicly available performance \u201cdashboard\u201d, but that has been abandoned as unfeasible. What we will be promised are metrics by which voters can measure progress towards \u201cdelivery milestones\u201d. All of which comes with upsides and downsides. There is a case for a carefully selected number of properly focussed targets. Done well, these can provide stars for government departments to steer by, and prompts to energise ministers and their officials. One cabinet member argues: \u201cEven if you don\u2019t fully achieve them, if you get 80% to 90% of the way there, you\u2019ve done better than you would have done if you didn\u2019t have a target.\u201d The case against them, especially if they are poorly chosen or if there are too many of them, is that targets become not a spur to performance but a distraction, which distorts activity in a damaging way. One political peril is that Sir Keir\u2019s goals will be derided as unambitious if the bar is set too low. Aides are adamant that this won\u2019t be the case. \u201cThe targets are designed to be very stretching,\u201d says one. \u201cThis is supposed to concentrate minds across government.\u201d If the goals are genuinely demanding, the hazard is that they become hostages to future fortune. His opponents and hostile elements of the media will ignore any successes and crow over any failures. The prime minister will be putting himself very visibly in charge of delivery on Thursday. This is in part the result of a view within Number 10 that the effort to make good on the missions has been too sluggish to date and now needs to be driven harder and faster. There\u2019s fear that change simply won\u2019t happen if the job is left to clunky committees of ministers and civil servants. Note also the reconfiguration of the personnel and the philosophy at Number 10 since the removal of Sue Gray as chief of staff after just 92 days in post. Morgan McSweeney, the architect of Labour\u2019s election campaign who supplanted her as chief of staff, is bringing a much more political edge to the job than the former civil servant he replaced. Colleagues report that he is ferociously obsessed with what he thinks Labour has to get done to win a second term. Jonathan Powell, who was chief of staff during Tony Blair\u2019s time as prime minister, has been made national security adviser. Mr Powell has told me in the past that one of his greatest regrets about the Blair government is that it didn\u2019t put much more effort into improving the machinery of government. Sir Michael Barber and Liz Lloyd, both staffers during the Blair years, have been brought in with briefs to make domestic reform effective \u2013 which they are doing in concert with Pat McFadden, also a New Labour veteran, who is the minister in charge of the work on the missions being done by the Cabinet Office. \u201cSue\u2019s view was that the centre needed to be weaker and the departments needed to be stronger,\u201d says a person highly familiar with Number 10\u2019s thinking. \u201cBut there is no substitute for having a strong centre if you want to drive change.\u201d During Ms Gray\u2019s time, cabinet ministers were encouraged to think of themselves as semi-autonomous entities. The regime now in place believes that vigorous reform will simply not happen unless Downing Street asserts itself by forcing ministers and officials to think outside their departmental boxes. Peter Hyman, one of the principal architects of the programme, has published a punchy piece contending that much of the civil service simply doesn\u2019t get the missions and that permanent secretaries are resisting the use of outside expertise. He urges Sir Keir to appoint \u201ca radical reformer\u201d as the next cabinet secretary. A different ally suggests that the \u201cPlan for Change\u201d is the result of the prime minister realising \u201chow difficult it is to renose the Whitehall machine in the direction that you want to take it\u201d. So Thursday\u2019s big event is not just aimed at the public. It is also designed to be an electric jolt to Whitehall to get with the programme. The external story will try to convey to voters what Labour hopes to achieve over the course of this parliament. The internal one, in the words of one cabinet member, is about injecting a lot more urgency into the civil service by \u201cgalvanising Whitehall and getting it to focus on the government\u2019s priorities\u201d. The prime minister will be pinning his reputation to delivery this week. Another way of putting it is to say that he is acknowledging the reality of presidential modern politics. Voters hold the man (or woman) at the top responsible for the performance of the government as a whole. Since that can\u2019t be ducked, it might as well be embraced, risks and all. Because if he can\u2019t produce the change he\u2019s promising, Sir Keir\u2019s \u201cdelivery milestones\u201d will be hung around his neck. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",

We are in no doubt at all about the global challenges the industry is facing and the need for us to play our part to support them.\u201d</p> <p>Labour sources said support for the 2030 target remains solid across government, including Keir Starmer. However, ministers are fast-tracking plans to review the fines for manufacturers who miss the EV quotas.</p>    <p>Carmakers have to ensure 28% of the cars and 16% of vans they sell are electric from January. If they fail, they currently face fines of \u00a315,000 for each vehicle outside the target. Ministers are holding a consultation on how far the fines could be reduced.</p> <p>Electric vehicles have very low carbon emissions and are considered to be vital in the bid to reach net zero. This is the point at which emissions across the planet have been reduced so much that these residues can be easily removed from the atmosphere, making it possible to halt the buildup of carbon in the atmosphere, the cause of global heating.</p> <p>Reynolds blamed the setbacks on the last government, who he accused of waging a \u201cculture war\u201d with green targets - destroying certainty and investment in the process. He said he wanted to make EVs \u201caffordable and accessible for working people and to boost the take-up of electric vehicles\u201d. It is understood that officials are looking at plans to boost demand, including the use of cheaper financing deals.</p> <p>It comes after a decision by Stellantis, the owner of Vauxhall, to close its van factory at Luton, putting 1,100 jobs at risk of being cut or relocated. The company blamed the UK\u2019s economic conditions and the government\u2019s zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate.

But he said the government had to be \u201cclear eyed\u201d in its effort to \u201ckeep the auto industry alive in the UK\u201d. \u201cWhen this government says that decarbonisation must not mean deindustrialisation, we mean it,\u201d Reynolds writes for the Observer today. \u201cThere is no route to net zero without backing British industries and workers. We are in no doubt at all about the global challenges the industry is facing and the need for us to play our part to support them.\u201d Labour sources said support for the 2030 target remains solid across government, including Keir Starmer. However, ministers are fast-tracking plans to review the fines for manufacturers who miss the EV quotas. Carmakers have to ensure 28% of the cars and 16% of vans they sell are electric from January. If they fail, they currently face fines of \u00a315,000 for each vehicle outside the target. Ministers are holding a consultation on how far the fines could be reduced. Electric vehicles have very low carbon emissions and are considered to be vital in the bid to reach net zero. This is the point at which emissions across the planet have been reduced so much that these residues can be easily removed from the atmosphere, making it possible to halt the buildup of carbon in the atmosphere, the cause of global heating. Reynolds blamed the setbacks on the last government, who he accused of waging a \u201cculture war\u201d with green targets - destroying certainty and investment in the process. He said he wanted to make EVs \u201caffordable and accessible for working people and to boost the take-up of electric vehicles\u201d. It is understood that officials are looking at plans to boost demand, including the use of cheaper financing deals. It comes after a decision by Stellantis, the owner of Vauxhall, to close its van factory at Luton, putting 1,100 jobs at risk of being cut or relocated. The company blamed the UK\u2019s economic conditions and the government\u2019s zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate. Days before, Ford announced it would cut 4,000 jobs in Europe, including 800 in the UK. Car manufacturers are under financial pressure from EV sales quotas because public demand is lower than expected. Carmakers met Reynolds last month to warn of the economic pressures caused by the tough targets. Ford UK boss Lisa Brankin warned last week that market challenges were making the financial regime around the move to electric vehicles \u201cunworkable\u201d. Brankin, chair and managing director of Ford UK, posted on LinkedIn: \u201cThe end goal is not in question, but current demand for electric vehicles is lower than expected and not in line with the mandated trajectory. \u201cFor manufacturers like Ford who have invested billions in new technologies and advanced manufacturing, there needs to be greater flexibility built into the scheme and government-backed incentives to help encourage customers to make the switch.\u201d There are also concerns among the unions over the goals to ensure the UK reaches net zero by 2050. Gary Smith, the GMB general secretary, told the BBC in September that the government\u2019s green policy were \u201chollowing out working class communities\u2019. Des Quinn, Unite national officer for the automotive industries, said that officials had introduced ambitious targets for EV sales, but had not provided the investment required for the charging infrastructure. He said he was optimistic there would be significant changes to the pathway for zero emission vehicles, but it had already caused economic damage. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable there are going to be further job losses,\u201d he said. \u201cSome work on electric vehicles might not start, or at least be put back.\u201d Quinn said in addition to reviewing the current targets, there needed to be a detailed impact assessment of the cost to jobs of moving to EVs. He said most losses would be in the supply chain where components now being manufactured for petrol and diesel cars will no longer be required. \u201cCar workers are going to be the new coal mining communities,\u201d he said. \u201cThrown on an industrial scrap heap and left to get on with it.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Ever since the end of the second world war, when Germans somewhat belatedly realised what the rhetoric of the Nazi years had done to their country, it has been a basic requirement of politicians in Germany that they should be boring. The very few postwar political figures whose speeches were exciting to listen to, such as Herbert Wehner or Franz Josef Strauss, met with widespread suspicion, not least because they were unwilling to follow this fundamental precept. Angela Merkel, federal chancellor and head of the German government from 2005 to 2021, was canny enough to adhere to it in full measure.</p> <p>The dullness of her political utterances is faithfully reproduced in this volume of memoirs. By and large, Merkel\u2019s recollection, assisted by her co-author (her long-term close ally and personal assistant Beate Baumann), is impressive, though I spotted one rather egregious mistake, where she claims that Willy Brandt, West German chancellor in the late 1960s and early 70s, urged his compatriots to \u201cdare more freedom\u201d; what he in fact said was that they should \u201cdare more democracy\u201d. The book has been rendered into American English by a team of no fewer than eight translators, who have remained true to the leaden prose of the German original. The editors at Macmillan claim that they have added explanations to the text \u201cto make it easier for a non-German audience\u201d to understand, but they have not done nearly enough. Merkel seems keen on mentioning every German politician she has ever had dealings with, and as one obscure name follows another through the tedious thickets of narrative detail, presenting individuals even I have never heard of (and I\u2019ve been working on Germany for half a century and more), it is all too easy not just to lose track but also to lose interest.</p>    <p>This is a book free from literary artifice, avoiding personal insights. What Merkel and Beaumann present to the reader is a kind of end-of-term report in which the former chancellor provides a blow-by-blow narrative. Much of it will be of little interest to readers outside Germany, and indeed in Germany itself if they haven\u2019t been immersed in the minutiae of German politics for the last several decades.</p> <p>Merkel overcame two serious handicaps as a modern German politician \u2013 the fact that she is a woman, too often condescended to by the male political world, and the fact that she grew up in communist East Germany (she was born in Hamburg, West Germany and moved there as a child), entering politics only with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. After leaving her position as a research scientist, she found her way into the conservative Christian Democratic Union and climbed up its party hierarchy rapidly through her command of detail and her negotiating skills. We learn very little about East Germany that we do not know already, and the minor acts of dissent in which the young Merkel became involved, especially as the daughter of a Protestant pastor in a country that was avowedly atheist, never amounted to very much. True to her immersion in detail, Merkel does not provide any kind of overall assessment of the Communist state in East Germany, its achievements and its deficits, or the reasons for its collapse.</p> <p>Merkel was catapulted into the top rank of politicians in post-unification Germany by a massive corruption scandal that forced the architect of reunification, the Christian Democratic politician Helmut Kohl, out of office. After an initial period leading her party in opposition to the government led by the Social Democratic politician Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, she won a national election in 2005 and entered the federal chancellor\u2019s office, where she remained for 16 years before retiring in 2021.</p> <p>As the head of government in the EU\u2019s most populous and economically powerful member state, Merkel won widespread plaudits for her calm, assured leadership, providing much-needed stability and continuity. She was above all else a crisis manager, stepping in \u2013 often rather late in the day \u2013 to deal with the knotty economic and political problems that others seemed incapable of resolving. \u201cIn politics,\u201d she observes, \u201cthings can escalate faster than you can blink.\u201d Her motto throughout was <em>wir schaffen das</em> (\u201cwe can do that\u201d). A good example of her belief in realpolitik allied to support for humanitarian causes was her decision in 2015 to allow in a million Syrian refugees fleeing the civil war caused by President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s cruel suppression of dissent, not least derived from her recognition that \u201cGermany is a country of immigration\u201d, making a regular influx of foreign workers \u201cunavoidable\u201d.</p>    <p>Merkel takes us through the numerous problems that confronted her as Germany\u2019s leader, from the financial crash of 2008, when she insisted on imposing \u201cfiscal discipline\u201d above all on the Greeks, to the depredations of Covid-19, when she was forced to make and remake policy on the hoof. Once again she plunges us into a detailed narrative without having anything of interest to say about the bigger picture. We learn that she got on well with US president George W Bush, with whom she was able to chat in English, but not so well with Vladimir Putin, though he spoke German and she could speak Russian; learning that she was afraid of dogs (after recently having been bitten by one), he insisted on bringing his black labrador Koni to their meetings to undermine her confidence (she calls this \u201ccanine power-play\u201d). She devotes just a handful of bland paragraphs to Brexit, and has nothing to say about her impressions of Boris Johnson as a man and a leader.</p> <p>Few politicians have suffered such a precipitous fall in reputation since leaving office than Angela Merkel. Little more than two months after she stepped down in December 2021, Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, igniting a conflict that is still going on and threatens to escalate. Merkel came under heavy&nbsp;criticism for increasing German dependency on Russian natural gas through the construction of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/07/russia-opens-gas-pipeline-that-runs-direct-to-western-europe\">Nord Stream pipeline</a>, handing Putin a powerful potential weapon of coercion against the west.</p> <p>The very considerable amount of space devoted in this book to environmental issues makes it clear just how important this issue was to Merkel, but it led her to close Germany\u2019s nuclear power facilities after the Fukushima accident in 2011, depriving Germany of a key alternative to fossil fuels. Her statement that \u201cGermany and Israel share the values of freedom, democracy, and the observance of human dignity\u201d seems grotesquely misconceived in the light of Netanyahu\u2019s assault on Gaza.</p> <p>Above all, Merkel shows no awareness of how the German economy has got into trouble through its failure to modernise and&nbsp;prepare for the post-industrial age. She is full of praise for Germany\u2019s traditional \u201cautomobile industry, mechanical engineering, and the chemical industry\u201d, a thoroughly shortsighted view. Under her leadership Germany\u2019s self-satisfied national culture became even more smug than it already was, and it is now paying the price.</p> <p>Despite the occasional self-criticism in this book, Merkel\u2019s failure to see the bigger picture testifies to her limited, pragmatic and detail-obsessed perception of political realities: realpolitik<em> </em>involves much more than just solving problems on a practical basis.

Drivers with previous models even slapped on bumper stickers reading \u201cthis is a real Mini\u201d. The BBC reported that executives insisted the car \u201cis not a small BMW\u201d.</p> <p>The storm died down, and Mini has gone on to sell more cars each year (about 300,000) than ever before, many of them emblazoned with union jack tail-lights \u2013 whatever the ownership of the factory.</p> <p>Another British car brand now hopes to follow a similar course through a barrage of controversy \u2013 albeit one supercharged in the social media age. Jaguar will, on Monday, unveil a first electric concept car in Miami. Yet this time it has not been the car that has provoked anger, but rather a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/23/jaguar-boss-defends-new-ad-and-rebrand-amid-vile-hatred-online\">30-second teaser trailer featuring a diverse group of models</a> walking around a vaguely alien landscape. \u201cCopy nothing\u201d is the tagline, channelling Jaguar founder William Lyons, while signalling a decisive break with the past.</p> <p>The backlash has been shocking. Tesla boss Elon Musk responded to the video on his social network, X, asking, \u201cdo you sell cars?\u201d (bringing the campaign to millions). The <em>Daily Mail</em> drew attention to unrelated remarks about diversity by a mid-level marketing executive who it wrongly said had \u201cmasterminded\u201d the rebrand, which it labelled \u201cwoke\u201d. That unleashed a rush of culture warriors and the online far right \u2013 plus a torrent of homophobia and transphobia in the advert\u2019s wake.</p> <p>All this before the public has even seen the car.</p> <p>The actual mastermind of the rebrand is Gerry McGovern, chief creative officer of JLR, the Indian-owned parent company of struggling Jaguar and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/10/land-rover-stresses-off-road-credentials-of-all-new-defender\">very successful Land Rover</a>.

      "bodyText": "When German manufacturer BMW took over the Mini brand and launched the Mini Cooper in 2001, some people were outraged. Drivers with previous models even slapped on bumper stickers reading \u201cthis is a real Mini\u201d. The BBC reported that executives insisted the car \u201cis not a small BMW\u201d. The storm died down, and Mini has gone on to sell more cars each year (about 300,000) than ever before, many of them emblazoned with union jack tail-lights \u2013 whatever the ownership of the factory. Another British car brand now hopes to follow a similar course through a barrage of controversy \u2013 albeit one supercharged in the social media age. Jaguar will, on Monday, unveil a first electric concept car in Miami. Yet this time it has not been the car that has provoked anger, but rather a 30-second teaser trailer featuring a diverse group of models walking around a vaguely alien landscape. \u201cCopy nothing\u201d is the tagline, channelling Jaguar founder William Lyons, while signalling a decisive break with the past. The backlash has been shocking. Tesla boss Elon Musk responded to the video on his social network, X, asking, \u201cdo you sell cars?\u201d (bringing the campaign to millions). The Daily Mail drew attention to unrelated remarks about diversity by a mid-level marketing executive who it wrongly said had \u201cmasterminded\u201d the rebrand, which it labelled \u201cwoke\u201d. That unleashed a rush of culture warriors and the online far right \u2013 plus a torrent of homophobia and transphobia in the advert\u2019s wake. All this before the public has even seen the car. The actual mastermind of the rebrand is Gerry McGovern, chief creative officer of JLR, the Indian-owned parent company of struggling Jaguar and very successful Land Rover. He has made it clear that provocation was part of the plan. \u201cHe wants to stir things up,\u201d said someone who has worked with him. \u201cThey clearly can\u2019t carry on with Jaguar as it is,\u201d said David Bailey, a professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham. The brand may be beloved, but sales fell from 180,000 in 2018 to fewer than 67,000 in its 2023 financial year. \u201cIt has been in decline,\u201d said Bailey. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been able to compete against the likes of BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi in the premium market.\u201d JLR tore up the Jaguar plan in 2021, cancelling an electric version of the venerable XJ saloon and instead aiming to be electric-only \u2013 and much more expensive \u2013 by 2025. Corporate logic, as much as creative impulse, has dictated design choices. Jaguar had a great design success with its award-winning I-Pace electric vehicle \u2013 still the only EV sold by JLR \u2013 but the brand could not go further down the SUV path with Jaguar in case it cannibalised profitable Land Rover sales. Instead, pictures of a heavily camouflaged car published by Autocar magazine show a grand tourer with the profile of an American muscle car. Teaser images show that it has also dispensed with the rear windscreen (in favour of a digital rear-view mirror \u2013 a move, already embraced by electric rival Polestar, that allows for better aerodynamic form ) as well as the \u201cgrowler\u201d cat logo. Ginny Buckley, the boss of British EV-buying website Electrifying.com, has seen the new Jaguar but agreed not to disclose details yet.

      "body": "<h2>Dance like no one\u2019s watching</h2> <p>Make it so that you don\u2019t have to pretend, with individual dancefloors for the shy and retiring.</p> <h2>Remove all chairs</h2> <p>Everyone sitting down signals the death of the party. People who are standing are more likely to move around and mingle, or start dancing, or start a fight. Exciting!</p> <h2>Bring back putting your car keys in a bowl</h2> <p>Who needs <a href=\"http://nextdoor.com/\">nextdoor.com</a> when you can explore the long-lost art of getting to know your neighbours\u2026 intimately.</p> <h2>Stuck in a conversation?</h2> <p>Give them a genuine compliment and the excuse that you need to refresh your drink. Or say you need to tell someone at the party something urgently \u2013 say it conspiratorially, tell them what it is. A touch of gossip is always good and makes them feel as if they\u2019re helping you out when you walk away.</p> <h2>Make an entrance</h2> <p><em>Dame Zandra Rhodes, fashion designer</em></p>    <p>Go in smiling! Walk in looking very assured, even if you don\u2019t feel it. Give off fabulous energy. Then, move around the room, see everyone and spread the joy. Remember, colour makes everything exciting so be sure to wear plenty of it \u2013 give guests a feast for their eyes. Definitely no grey and black, please. A gold suit is always stunning, or wear something out of place\u2026 a pair of bold print pyjamas, or a bright handkerchief that is really a napkin. Whatever you do, make an effort. When someone\u2019s really dressed to the teeth it\u2019s exciting, because that person has bothered \u2013 it makes the party. Put flowers in your hair, wear a coloured wig or an exotic turban. Come up with a shawl or a feather boa \u2013 and don\u2019t be afraid to make a mistake. And if you do, great \u2013 it might be the talking point of the whole party.</p> <h2>Avoid a faux pas</h2> <p>Rylan Clark says Barbara Windsor once gave him this advice: when introduced to someone always say, \u201cLovely to see you\u201d, rather than \u201cNice to meet you\u201d, just in case you\u2019ve actually met them before. </p> <h2>Prepare some one-liners</h2> <p>David Sedaris steals icebreakers from Duolingo, like: \u201cHow long have you known your dentist?\u201d or from an old copy of <em>Teach Yourself Japanese</em>, which included the phrase, \u201cI no longer take any pleasure in my work. Shall I quit tomorrow?\u201d</p> <h2>Get permission to post</h2> <p>Don\u2019t share pics online without asking the host. They might have a stolen painting up in their living room or, <em>imagine</em>, invited only one half of a divorcing couple.</p> <h2>Hype up the guests a week early</h2> <p>A little text in advance, such as \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see you!\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to introducing you to S, I think you\u2019ll really hit it off\u2026\u201d means they\u2019ll arrive excited. Give them a little job (\u201cPlease bring a big bowl!\u201d) to make them feel included and vital to the proceedings.</p> <h2>Sharing is caring</h2> <p>Tell everybody exactly what you think of them. Embrace the punches, the eye rolls, the compliments in return, and the wet kisses, too.</p> <h2>Make it snappy</h2> <p><em>Rhik Samadder, columnist</em></p>    <p>Smartphones are the death of joy. Whenever they\u2019re whipped out for photographs, people are already thinking about how to untag themselves. You should distribute disposable cameras instead, right? Incorrect. We\u2019re about immediate gratification now and there\u2019s no going back. Get an Instax or Polaroid. The pictures appear immediately, are flattering and precious \u2013 people want to keep them. Make a night feel vintage while you\u2019re still in it.</p> <h2>Be fashionably late</h2> <p><em>Grace Campbell, comedian</em></p> <p>The key to a good entrance is arriving late enough that people are wondering where you are, but not so late that it\u2019s deemed as rude. Create a buzz. People saying, \u201cWhere is she?\u201d Then arrive with an exciting story to tell. If you want to be noticed upon entering a party then\u2026 be noticeable! I\u2019m not saying you should wear the coat from <em>Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat</em>, but something you feel confident and comfortable in. Smaller heels. Fewer layers to avoid getting too hot. And not white \u2013 in case of spillage.</p> <h2>Farewell your plus-one</h2> <p>Arriving with a partner? You have maybe 10 minutes to talk to each other, then it\u2019s time to share a significant look, go your own way \u2013 and work the room. You go left, they go right.</p> <h2>Dos and don\u2019ts for guests</h2> <p>Bring something with you. It doesn\u2019t have to be expensive, or even alcoholic, but make sure you have something lovely to press into your host\u2019s hands. Don\u2019t ask what they want, they\u2019ll say, \u201cnothing!\u201d But they don\u2019t mean it. And if you do arrive empty-handed, then you\u2019d better be bringing the most insanely sparkling conversation that the room has ever seen.</p> <h2>Jazz it up with jelly</h2> <p><em>Ashish Gupta, fashion designer</em></p>    <p>You need to make guests feel as though they\u2019re entering a little fantasy, for which you need flowers and lamps. The worst thing in the world is overhead lighting. Hideous. You go to a party for two things: good conversation, and to get laid. With good lighting, everyone looks sexy, and if you fill the house with flowers, like marigolds or orchids, everything smells amazing, so you\u2019re already halfway there. Always have one gorgeous little thing, like alcoholic jelly and ice-cream, served in champagne coupes \u2013 quite simple but visually luscious. You don\u2019t need a theme, but you should have a vibe. Like \u201csparkle\u201d. In India, we use tinsel for everything \u2013 you shouldn\u2019t just bring it out for Christmas. The difference between a good party and a bad party is that a good party is never too tasteful.</p> <h2>Let some sparks fly</h2> <p>You can get these firework packs nowadays where you light one fuse and it sets off a whole display. Look for boxes with names that sound like problematic pop stars or energy drinks \u2013 things like Terminal Velocity or The Dogz. The worse the name, the better the display.</p> <h2>Phones in a basket by the door, please</h2> <p>You really don\u2019t need to check the news. Everything is still terrible out there. </p> <h2>Get a fierce manicure</h2> <p>Sharpen nails into Edward Scissorhands blades and slice your clothes off as the night gets late.</p> <h2>Design your night</h2> <p><em>David Koma, fashion designer</em></p> <p>First impressions set the mood. Design a dramatic entrance with lighting and a statement backdrop that suits the party theme for your guests\u2019 grand arrival. This \u201cportal\u201d sets the tone for the night and lets partygoers leave their everyday cares behind.</p> <h2>Offer up a secret</h2> <p>Consider telling a fellow guest a secret that you\u2019ve never said out loud before. Radical honesty tends to be met with radical honesty. Nothing too heavy, though, you don\u2019t want to be a mood hoover.</p> <h2>Ramp up your dance moves</h2> <p><em>Crystal, drag artist</em></p> <p>There\u2019s nothing like walking into a venue and seeing a drag queen sitting on the bar to let you know you\u2019re in for a good night. Nothing beats drag for giving people permission to forget their inhibitions and nothing brings a party together like learning a dance. I recommend the electric slide \u2013 it\u2019s easy to learn, has great visual impact in a group and goes with almost every song. Finishing touch? Confetti cannons! They\u2019re cheap and they pack a punch. Save them for the drop of the big song of the night. Hide a mini one in your purse for maximum impact.</p> <h2>Let your loved ones in</h2> <p><em>Philippa Perry, psychotherapist</em></p> <p>There\u2019s only one great thing that makes a great party. It\u2019s not the decorations, or what you wear, it\u2019s not about the food (takeaway pizza and crisps are fine), it\u2019s about the people. Invite people who are open, like to laugh, like to cry, people who are easy to connect with, people you just love to be with, people who are loving, forgiving and lovable. Don\u2019t invite anyone just because you think you should, just invite people you really want there and who want to be there.</p> <h2>Play to the heart</h2> <p><em>Miquita Oliver, presenter</em></p>    <p>Choose music that makes your heart feel good \u2013 or put Stevie Wonder on and leave it up to him. And let\u2019s party somewhere with a spectacular view. There\u2019s something truly magical about having a good time and looking across the city filled with other people having a good time.</p> <h2>Get fancy with flowers</h2> <p><em>Hazel Gardiner, floral artist</em></p> <p>Command attention by cascading thick curtains of trailing amaranthus from a giant urn, enveloping guests in a screen of burgundy. Place a runner of dried allium schubertii heads along a table, spilling on to the floor \u2013 use chicken wire for support so you can create undulating sparks of drama.</p> <h2>Give goodies to go</h2> <p><em>Matthew Williamson, fashion designer</em></p> <p>Send everyone home with a thoughtful goody bag \u2013 breakfast treats for the morning after are the perfect finishing touch. Add a candle, Alka-Seltzer, Rescue Remedy, eye mask and bath salts for an extra touch of relaxation.</p> <h2>\u2026And make them memorable</h2> <p>An alternative party bag could include an invitation to a group WhatsApp for a full party debrief and photo drop, a tinned Bloody Mary, a pain au chocolat and how about a thank-you card for them to fill out, pen included.</p> <h2>Follow the formula</h2> <p><em>Fran Cutler, queen of parties</em></p>    <p>There\u2019s a perfect party formula, so follow it. For venue, go for one room \u2013 super luxe and super comfy \u2013 with a smoking area and great toilets. (Not <em>too </em>great, though, otherwise people will spend too much time in there.) Start at 8pm, then people get there for 9pm. Because if you say 9pm, they get there at 10.30pm. You\u2019ll get your early birds who want to stay all night and then those who go to dinner first, then want their three hours of dancing. Later on, surprise the crowd with an iconic performer \u2013 they\u2019ll go wild.</p> <h2>Unleash freedom</h2> <p><em>Tom Rasmussen, musician</em></p> <p>Well, you\u2019re going to need to reach for euphoria. You can\u2019t fake your way to the top of emotion \u2013 this party has to be about opportunities for real, actual freedom. No dress code, but a door policy: Are you annoying? Are you a \u201cco-worker\u201d (in the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mckenziewark3000/?hl=en\">McKenzie Wark</a> conceptual sense) or someone who doesn\u2019t have the right vibe? We all know one who thinks they\u2019re much too cool, or is out to exploit resources while giving nothing back. Next you\u2019ll need a fully free, no-questions-asked bar (or at least a nearby 24-hour offie) and then limes \u2013 an inordinate number of limes. Cigarettes can be smoked anywhere, ash can be dropped anywhere, drinks can be spilled and anyone can kiss anyone provided all parties are consenting. Plus-ones, plus-10s are allowed as long as nobody is morbid, dread or a poseur. You must be willing to let chaos ensue.</p> <h2>Build a champagne tower</h2> <p><em>Laura Jackson, co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.glassette.com/\">glassette.com</a>, stylist and broadcaster</em></p>    <p>Fill the room with multi-coloured balloons \u2013 there should be no space on the ceiling to be seen. Serve truffle cheese toasties, roast potatoes with aioli and the largest champagne tower you can build. At midnight, hand out chocolate cigarette eclairs on a silver trolley, followed by espresso martinis.</p> <h2>You have a \u2018no shoes inside\u2019 rule?</h2> <p>You\u2019re going to have to manage your expectations for the evening. Dressed-up adults should not be made to stand in their socks, or \u2013 the horror \u2013 barefoot.</p> <h2>Let your hair express who you are</h2> <p><em>Charlotte Mensah, hair stylist</em></p> <p>Bring your full self to the party. I\u2019m talking about a vibrant expression of self with two things: your hair and a classic hall party with a modern twist. The giant community hall party is a tradition of celebration I grew up with in Ghana and that we carry on as part of the diaspora in the UK. Take the hall party first. For this you need a rhythmic pounding of drums, singing at the top of your voices, big tunes, extravagant outfits and the sweet aromas of jollof rice and palm wine. Now to your hair, which is your chance for an even bigger expression of individuality: afros, red hair, pink hair, shaved heads, elaborate head wraps and intricate braids. Ghana meets London meets beauty \u2013 the ultimate party.</p> <h2>Get ready to run</h2> <p><em>Tia Kofi, drag performer</em></p> <p>In these uncertain times, we should throw caution to the wind with a healthy dose of practicality. I would highly recommend all glad rags are to be worn with a sensible running shoe, not a heel, should a swift escape be necessary. Avoid gowns as they can\u2019t be hitched up when running from a zombie horde. For anyone sporting a suit for the occasion, a white pocket square would be the most chic as it can also double as a flag should you need to surrender to a <em>Mad Max</em>-style mob. Of course, just for additional supernatural safety, all drinks should be served with holy water as a mixer creating the perfect beverage to dash on to the face of any approaching vampire or demon.</p> <h2>Serve cheesy buns and bubbles</h2> <p><em>Itamar Srulovich, restaurateur, Honey &amp; Co</em></p> <p>For food, serve bouikos. These feta and cheddar buns from the Balkans are so easy to make, and you can make them ahead \u2013 have a tray in the oven just before guests arrive and it will fill the place with the most mouthwatering aroma, better than any scented candle (and cheaper! and tastier!). They are perfect with a glass of bubbles. Serve with dips and <a href=\"https://www.bonillacrispsuk.co.uk/\">Bonilla</a> crisps \u2013 they\u2019re delicious and come in huge buckets \u2013 they are a party in their own right.<em> </em>One more thing: the key to making a party work is being sure to make introductions.

Using a dropper, gently pour 2ml bitters around the rim of a frozen martini glass. Prick an olive three times with a cocktail stick and let a little juice run out into the glass.

I\u2019d love to say the party needs the most impressive lights or sound system, the best DJs ever, the most incredible performers. But does it? Surely, if we all know it\u2019s our final few hours, the most amazing way to go is in knowing that all of humanity is making the ground shake as one.

Keep the lighting low and cosy, a mix of red and amber lights to give the room that smoky, late-night feel and, of course, a classic disco ball to give just the right amount of sparkle. Most importantly, create a space that celebrates all body types and identities, making everyone feel at ease to just dance and be themselves. This night\u2019s all about the music, the community and a feelgood, no-judgment atmosphere.</p> <h2>\u2026Make a memorable exit</h2> <p><em>Crystal, drag artist</em></p> <p>Don\u2019t slink off like an apology.

      "bodyText": "Dance like no one\u2019s watching Make it so that you don\u2019t have to pretend, with individual dancefloors for the shy and retiring. Remove all chairs Everyone sitting down signals the death of the party. People who are standing are more likely to move around and mingle, or start dancing, or start a fight. Exciting! Bring back putting your car keys in a bowl Who needs nextdoor.com when you can explore the long-lost art of getting to know your neighbours\u2026 intimately. Stuck in a conversation? Give them a genuine compliment and the excuse that you need to refresh your drink. Or say you need to tell someone at the party something urgently \u2013 say it conspiratorially, tell them what it is. A touch of gossip is always good and makes them feel as if they\u2019re helping you out when you walk away. Make an entrance Dame Zandra Rhodes, fashion designer Go in smiling! Walk in looking very assured, even if you don\u2019t feel it. Give off fabulous energy. Then, move around the room, see everyone and spread the joy. Remember, colour makes everything exciting so be sure to wear plenty of it \u2013 give guests a feast for their eyes. Definitely no grey and black, please. A gold suit is always stunning, or wear something out of place\u2026 a pair of bold print pyjamas, or a bright handkerchief that is really a napkin. Whatever you do, make an effort. When someone\u2019s really dressed to the teeth it\u2019s exciting, because that person has bothered \u2013 it makes the party. Put flowers in your hair, wear a coloured wig or an exotic turban. Come up with a shawl or a feather boa \u2013 and don\u2019t be afraid to make a mistake. And if you do, great \u2013 it might be the talking point of the whole party. Avoid a faux pas Rylan Clark says Barbara Windsor once gave him this advice: when introduced to someone always say, \u201cLovely to see you\u201d, rather than \u201cNice to meet you\u201d, just in case you\u2019ve actually met them before. Prepare some one-liners David Sedaris steals icebreakers from Duolingo, like: \u201cHow long have you known your dentist?\u201d or from an old copy of Teach Yourself Japanese, which included the phrase, \u201cI no longer take any pleasure in my work. Shall I quit tomorrow?\u201d Get permission to post Don\u2019t share pics online without asking the host. They might have a stolen painting up in their living room or, imagine, invited only one half of a divorcing couple. Hype up the guests a week early A little text in advance, such as \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see you!\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to introducing you to S, I think you\u2019ll really hit it off\u2026\u201d means they\u2019ll arrive excited. Give them a little job (\u201cPlease bring a big bowl!\u201d) to make them feel included and vital to the proceedings. Sharing is caring Tell everybody exactly what you think of them. Embrace the punches, the eye rolls, the compliments in return, and the wet kisses, too. Make it snappy Rhik Samadder, columnist Smartphones are the death of joy. Whenever they\u2019re whipped out for photographs, people are already thinking about how to untag themselves. You should distribute disposable cameras instead, right? Incorrect. We\u2019re about immediate gratification now and there\u2019s no going back. Get an Instax or Polaroid. The pictures appear immediately, are flattering and precious \u2013 people want to keep them. Make a night feel vintage while you\u2019re still in it. Be fashionably late Grace Campbell, comedian The key to a good entrance is arriving late enough that people are wondering where you are, but not so late that it\u2019s deemed as rude. Create a buzz. People saying, \u201cWhere is she?\u201d Then arrive with an exciting story to tell. If you want to be noticed upon entering a party then\u2026 be noticeable! I\u2019m not saying you should wear the coat from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, but something you feel confident and comfortable in. Smaller heels. Fewer layers to avoid getting too hot. And not white \u2013 in case of spillage. Farewell your plus-one Arriving with a partner? You have maybe 10 minutes to talk to each other, then it\u2019s time to share a significant look, go your own way \u2013 and work the room. You go left, they go right. Dos and don\u2019ts for guests Bring something with you. It doesn\u2019t have to be expensive, or even alcoholic, but make sure you have something lovely to press into your host\u2019s hands. Don\u2019t ask what they want, they\u2019ll say, \u201cnothing!\u201d But they don\u2019t mean it. And if you do arrive empty-handed, then you\u2019d better be bringing the most insanely sparkling conversation that the room has ever seen. Jazz it up with jelly Ashish Gupta, fashion designer You need to make guests feel as though they\u2019re entering a little fantasy, for which you need flowers and lamps. The worst thing in the world is overhead lighting. Hideous. You go to a party for two things: good conversation, and to get laid. With good lighting, everyone looks sexy, and if you fill the house with flowers, like marigolds or orchids, everything smells amazing, so you\u2019re already halfway there. Always have one gorgeous little thing, like alcoholic jelly and ice-cream, served in champagne coupes \u2013 quite simple but visually luscious. You don\u2019t need a theme, but you should have a vibe. Like \u201csparkle\u201d. In India, we use tinsel for everything \u2013 you shouldn\u2019t just bring it out for Christmas. The difference between a good party and a bad party is that a good party is never too tasteful. Let some sparks fly You can get these firework packs nowadays where you light one fuse and it sets off a whole display. Look for boxes with names that sound like problematic pop stars or energy drinks \u2013 things like Terminal Velocity or The Dogz. The worse the name, the better the display. Phones in a basket by the door, please You really don\u2019t need to check the news. Everything is still terrible out there. Get a fierce manicure Sharpen nails into Edward Scissorhands blades and slice your clothes off as the night gets late. Design your night David Koma, fashion designer First impressions set the mood. Design a dramatic entrance with lighting and a statement backdrop that suits the party theme for your guests\u2019 grand arrival. This \u201cportal\u201d sets the tone for the night and lets partygoers leave their everyday cares behind. Offer up a secret Consider telling a fellow guest a secret that you\u2019ve never said out loud before. Radical honesty tends to be met with radical honesty. Nothing too heavy, though, you don\u2019t want to be a mood hoover. Ramp up your dance moves Crystal, drag artist There\u2019s nothing like walking into a venue and seeing a drag queen sitting on the bar to let you know you\u2019re in for a good night. Nothing beats drag for giving people permission to forget their inhibitions and nothing brings a party together like learning a dance. I recommend the electric slide \u2013 it\u2019s easy to learn, has great visual impact in a group and goes with almost every song. Finishing touch? Confetti cannons! They\u2019re cheap and they pack a punch. Save them for the drop of the big song of the night. Hide a mini one in your purse for maximum impact. Let your loved ones in Philippa Perry, psychotherapist There\u2019s only one great thing that makes a great party. It\u2019s not the decorations, or what you wear, it\u2019s not about the food (takeaway pizza and crisps are fine), it\u2019s about the people. Invite people who are open, like to laugh, like to cry, people who are easy to connect with, people you just love to be with, people who are loving, forgiving and lovable. Don\u2019t invite anyone just because you think you should, just invite people you really want there and who want to be there. Play to the heart Miquita Oliver, presenter Choose music that makes your heart feel good \u2013 or put Stevie Wonder on and leave it up to him. And let\u2019s party somewhere with a spectacular view. There\u2019s something truly magical about having a good time and looking across the city filled with other people having a good time. Get fancy with flowers Hazel Gardiner, floral artist Command attention by cascading thick curtains of trailing amaranthus from a giant urn, enveloping guests in a screen of burgundy. Place a runner of dried allium schubertii heads along a table, spilling on to the floor \u2013 use chicken wire for support so you can create undulating sparks of drama. Give goodies to go Matthew Williamson, fashion designer Send everyone home with a thoughtful goody bag \u2013 breakfast treats for the morning after are the perfect finishing touch. Add a candle, Alka-Seltzer, Rescue Remedy, eye mask and bath salts for an extra touch of relaxation. \u2026And make them memorable An alternative party bag could include an invitation to a group WhatsApp for a full party debrief and photo drop, a tinned Bloody Mary, a pain au chocolat and how about a thank-you card for them to fill out, pen included. Follow the formula Fran Cutler, queen of parties There\u2019s a perfect party formula, so follow it. For venue, go for one room \u2013 super luxe and super comfy \u2013 with a smoking area and great toilets. (Not too great, though, otherwise people will spend too much time in there.) Start at 8pm, then people get there for 9pm. Because if you say 9pm, they get there at 10.30pm. You\u2019ll get your early birds who want to stay all night and then those who go to dinner first, then want their three hours of dancing. Later on, surprise the crowd with an iconic performer \u2013 they\u2019ll go wild. Unleash freedom Tom Rasmussen, musician Well, you\u2019re going to need to reach for euphoria. You can\u2019t fake your way to the top of emotion \u2013 this party has to be about opportunities for real, actual freedom. No dress code, but a door policy: Are you annoying? Are you a \u201cco-worker\u201d (in the McKenzie Wark conceptual sense) or someone who doesn\u2019t have the right vibe? We all know one who thinks they\u2019re much too cool, or is out to exploit resources while giving nothing back. Next you\u2019ll need a fully free, no-questions-asked bar (or at least a nearby 24-hour offie) and then limes \u2013 an inordinate number of limes. Cigarettes can be smoked anywhere, ash can be dropped anywhere, drinks can be spilled and anyone can kiss anyone provided all parties are consenting. Plus-ones, plus-10s are allowed as long as nobody is morbid, dread or a poseur. You must be willing to let chaos ensue. Build a champagne tower Laura Jackson, co-founder of glassette.com, stylist and broadcaster Fill the room with multi-coloured balloons \u2013 there should be no space on the ceiling to be seen. Serve truffle cheese toasties, roast potatoes with aioli and the largest champagne tower you can build. At midnight, hand out chocolate cigarette eclairs on a silver trolley, followed by espresso martinis. You have a \u2018no shoes inside\u2019 rule? You\u2019re going to have to manage your expectations for the evening. Dressed-up adults should not be made to stand in their socks, or \u2013 the horror \u2013 barefoot. Let your hair express who you are Charlotte Mensah, hair stylist Bring your full self to the party. I\u2019m talking about a vibrant expression of self with two things: your hair and a classic hall party with a modern twist. The giant community hall party is a tradition of celebration I grew up with in Ghana and that we carry on as part of the diaspora in the UK. Take the hall party first. For this you need a rhythmic pounding of drums, singing at the top of your voices, big tunes, extravagant outfits and the sweet aromas of jollof rice and palm wine. Now to your hair, which is your chance for an even bigger expression of individuality: afros, red hair, pink hair, shaved heads, elaborate head wraps and intricate braids. Ghana meets London meets beauty \u2013 the ultimate party. Get ready to run Tia Kofi, drag performer In these uncertain times, we should throw caution to the wind with a healthy dose of practicality. I would highly recommend all glad rags are to be worn with a sensible running shoe, not a heel, should a swift escape be necessary. Avoid gowns as they can\u2019t be hitched up when running from a zombie horde. For anyone sporting a suit for the occasion, a white pocket square would be the most chic as it can also double as a flag should you need to surrender to a Mad Max-style mob. Of course, just for additional supernatural safety, all drinks should be served with holy water as a mixer creating the perfect beverage to dash on to the face of any approaching vampire or demon. Serve cheesy buns and bubbles Itamar Srulovich, restaurateur, Honey &amp; Co For food, serve bouikos. These feta and cheddar buns from the Balkans are so easy to make, and you can make them ahead \u2013 have a tray in the oven just before guests arrive and it will fill the place with the most mouthwatering aroma, better than any scented candle (and cheaper! and tastier!). They are perfect with a glass of bubbles. Serve with dips and Bonilla crisps \u2013 they\u2019re delicious and come in huge buckets \u2013 they are a party in their own right. One more thing: the key to making a party work is being sure to make introductions. A good party is one where you meet someone interesting, hear a good story and make a new friend. Recipe: feta and spring onion bouikos There are two key factors in getting the best texture here: use cold ingredients, and work them as little as possible. Makes 12 small or 6 large cold butter 50g mature cheddar 40g feta 40g plain flour 100g sour cream 50ml nigella seeds 1\u20442 tsp spring onions 2, chopped (or 2 tbsp chopped chives) milk to glaze (optional) Cut your cold butter into small cubes. Grate the cheddar and crumble the feta, then combine all the ingredients together straight away. Work the mixture until just combined; lumps of butter and cheese are exactly what you want in this dough (when you bake it, they will melt and ooze). Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and pat it down to a rough rectangle 2-3cm thick. I traditionally cut it into triangles, like so: flour the blade of your knife, cut the dough in half lengthways, slice across three times to divide it into six squares, then cut each of these from corner to corner to give you 12 small triangles. Preheat the oven to 220C/ gas mark 7. Brush the bouikos with milk and bake on the upper-middle shelf of the oven for 10 minutes. Carefully turn the tray round, then reduce the temperature to 200C/gas mark 6 and bake for a further 6-8 minutes, until golden. Keep the heat If food is meant to be eaten hot, don\u2019t serve it cold. Nothing good has ever come of congealed pizza. Bring a martini bar with you Arrive with at least three bottles of gin (or vodka, if you must) and vermouth, a few tins of Perello olives, a bag of ice and a cocktail shaker. You\u2019ll make new friends faster than you ever have in your entire life. One failsafe recipe is the Connaught Martini.

      "body": "<p>The Swedish photographer Lars Tunbj\u00f6rk spent five years in the late 1990s touring city offices in New York, Tokyo and Stockholm and documenting what he found there. This picture was taken in a Manhattan legal office in 1997; it would be safe to say it was not paper-free. Though Tunbj\u00f6rk might not quite have known it at the time, he captured in those pictures enclosed, climate-controlled worlds in mortal jeopardy. New York\u2019s 2002 Smoke Free Air Act, for example, confined to history small men wandering the office with cigars between their teeth; women in pearls surrounded by legal proofs under office tables also became a rarer sight in the new millennium.</p> <p>Tunbj\u00f6rk, who died in 2015, did not stage his pictures. He became a modern master of the padded cubicle and the strip light and the ergonomic swivel chair. When his book of office pictures was first published in 2001 in a limited edition, it quickly sold out. A new version, with a second related volume of LA offices from later years is now being published. They might have come with quotes from anthropologist David Graeber\u2019s book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/27/bullshit-jobs-a-theory-david-graeber-review-laboured-rant\">Bullshit Jobs</a></em>, or perhaps better from Joshua Ferris\u2019s pitch-perfect novel of cubicle life <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/01/fiction.features1\">Then W</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/01/fiction.features1\">e </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/01/fiction.features1\">Came to the </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/01/fiction.features1\">End</a></em>: \u201cWe liked wasting time, but almost nothing was more annoying than having our wasted time wasted on something not worth wasting it on.\u201d</p> <p>The technology helps to date each of the pictures precisely. Computer monitors were about the size and weight of microwave ovens and they are stacked on cheap desks while their human users wrestle with interfaces and listen to the barks and whistles of dial-up internet connections. Wires proliferate and refuse to be tamed. No one is looking at a phone screen. Office furniture did not yet encompass the modular sofa, cleverly designed to fill gaps left by redundant colleagues.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://loosejoints.biz/products/office\">Office</a> </em>by Lars Tunbj\u00f6rk is published by Loose Joints (\u00a372)</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "The Swedish photographer Lars Tunbj\u00f6rk spent five years in the late 1990s touring city offices in New York, Tokyo and Stockholm and documenting what he found there. This picture was taken in a Manhattan legal office in 1997; it would be safe to say it was not paper-free. Though Tunbj\u00f6rk might not quite have known it at the time, he captured in those pictures enclosed, climate-controlled worlds in mortal jeopardy. New York\u2019s 2002 Smoke Free Air Act, for example, confined to history small men wandering the office with cigars between their teeth; women in pearls surrounded by legal proofs under office tables also became a rarer sight in the new millennium. Tunbj\u00f6rk, who died in 2015, did not stage his pictures. He became a modern master of the padded cubicle and the strip light and the ergonomic swivel chair. When his book of office pictures was first published in 2001 in a limited edition, it quickly sold out. A new version, with a second related volume of LA offices from later years is now being published. They might have come with quotes from anthropologist David Graeber\u2019s book Bullshit Jobs, or perhaps better from Joshua Ferris\u2019s pitch-perfect novel of cubicle life Then We Came to the End: \u201cWe liked wasting time, but almost nothing was more annoying than having our wasted time wasted on something not worth wasting it on.\u201d The technology helps to date each of the pictures precisely. Computer monitors were about the size and weight of microwave ovens and they are stacked on cheap desks while their human users wrestle with interfaces and listen to the barks and whistles of dial-up internet connections. Wires proliferate and refuse to be tamed. No one is looking at a phone screen. Office furniture did not yet encompass the modular sofa, cleverly designed to fill gaps left by redundant colleagues. Office by Lars Tunbj\u00f6rk is published by Loose Joints (\u00a372)",

My office is always a mess. My wife, Jill, will say so and I\u2019ll try and tidy up a bit, but that means hiding things. The most expensive thing I own is the Teen Wolf costume from the film Teen Wolf. Sunday evenings? We\u2019ll arrange a movie night, but it never happens. We\u2019ll go, \u2018Should we watch a film tonight?\u2019 Then it gets to 8.30pm and because now I\u2019ve got teenagers, they wander upstairs. I think: \u2018Why are you upstairs? Why are you not downstairs with me? There\u2019s lots of people who\u2019d like to hang out with me. I\u2019ve got two Baftas!\u2019 Sundays growing up? Boring as fuck. I lived in Leeds. When I was a kid, I would go skateboarding. That was exciting. But when I got a bit older and stopped skateboarding, Sundays became boring because all the shops were closed. Love or dread Mondays? With my privileged lifestyle, every day is exciting. I don\u2019t care what day it is because I never know what I\u2019m going to do.

The Liberal Democrat leader has joined the Bath Philharmonia to produce a Christmas <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dnoVc5sv9o&amp;ab_channel=LiberalDemocrats\">charity single, Love Is Enough</a>, in what appears to be a first for a main political party leader.</p> <p>Written by young carers and former carers, the song is in aid of Carers Trust and the Bath Philharmonia (as a teenager, Davey nursed his mother when she had terminal cancer). Some might think, with all that bungee-jumping and paddleboarding in the run-up to the general election, we\u2019ve already seen quite enough of \u201ccuddly Ed\u201d in 2024. </p> <p>But wait! Accompanied by a charming, homespun video, Love Is Enough is a sweet, uplifting song, in which Davey\u2019s gutsy vocals appear to be mysteriously reserved (Sidelined? Never!) as an occasional garnish.</p>    <p>If Love Is Enough wants to be your 2024 festive heart-melter, the competition is fierce.

Now more than 50 years old, could it be having a midlife crisis?</p> <p>Late Beatle George Harrison produced the first recognised charity single with Bangla Desh in 1971, raising money for Unicef to help those affected by the Bhola cyclone and the Bangladesh Liberation war. In 1984, Band Aid\u2019s Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas? was organised by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure for Ethiopian famine relief. Setting the charity single template (big stars, draughty-looking recording studio, inveterate sharing of microphones), Band Aid has been revamped every decade since. </p> <p>The latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/nov/13/band-aid-do-they-know-its-christmas-40th-anniversary-news\">40th anniversary edition of Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas?</a>, out last week, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/nov/29/band-aid-40-fails-to-reach-uk-top-40-in-opening-week\">failed to enter the Top 40 </a>so far, sitting at No 45. </p> <p>But the original is still only outsold in the UK by another charity single, Elton John\u2019s Candle In the Wind, 1997, released to mark <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/30/elton-johns-your-song-originally-slated-for-diana-funeral\">Diana, Princess of Wales\u2019s death</a>. Band Aid inspired the 1985 stateside effort We Are The World, for which a scrum of A-list artists (including Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie and Cyndi Lauper) were notably instructed to \u201ccheck your ego at the door\u201d. Since then, it has been non-stop, with musical fundraising for such causes as the Grenfell Tower fire, the Zeebrugge ferry disaster, Aids research, and, recently, the Trussell Trust food bank charity, courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/20/ladbaby-i-love-sausage-rolls-christmas-no-1\">LadBaby spoofs</a> such as We Built This City (On Sausage Rolls).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>So, why do the fundraising singles keep coming? Short answer: charities are desperate for your help</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the UK, pop and charity have become fused symbiotically in the public imagination, facilitated by telethons such as Comic Relief and Children in Need. Though for every intriguing re-reading of a classic (Lou Reed\u2019s Perfect Day, featuring Reed, David Bowie, et al), there have been a clutch of make-it-stop horrors: 1991\u2019s novelty-record bloodbath, The Stonk by Hale And Pace; <em>The X Factor</em> finalists\u2019 2010 nightmarishly ritzy and corporate cover of Bowie\u2019s Heroes. Indeed, as time has gone by, the impression has been that charity singles do better when they look spontaneous, homemade, disorganised, non-manufactured \u2013 basically as non-Simon-Cowelled as possible.</p> <p>How long can this bandwagon keep creaking along, the cynically minded may wonder. Isn\u2019t the public weary of being preached at by self-aggrandising pop stars, who think arriving at a studio in a clapped-out minicab makes them look humble and \u201cstreet\u201d?</p> <p>Over the years, there have also been cyclical complaints that the Band Aid behemoth is ethically dubious: stereotyping the diverse expanse of Africa and propagating a western saviour complex. On the recent anniversary, Ed Sheeran, citing a critical post by the artist, Fuse ODG, said he\u2019d not been approached for permission to re-use his 2014 Band Aid contribution for the 2024 mix, where it appears; and, had he been asked, he would have \u201crespectfully declined\u201d. For his part, Geldof says multitudes in Africa are still in need: \u201cThat little pop song has kept millions alive.\u201d</p>    <p>Ironically, Band Aid could lay claim to being the least cynical of all charity singles: no one involved could have guessed what it would become. However, for some, disenchantment extends beyond Band Aid to all such endeavours. Once hailed as a scepticism-resistant medium spanning demographics, the charity single is now periodically condemned as an act of creative torpor and industry calculation. Critics abhor everything from the celebrity-philanthropy to charity big business to the over-simplification of complex issues. The rationale being: why not just swerve the whole shebang and donate directly to the cause?</p> <p>The changing times could be part of the problem. Unlike with Band Aid, there\u2019s no physical single for a hands-on buzz. Rather, it\u2019s a complicated, slightly sterile business involving downloads, streams, subscription services \u2026 be still, your beating altruistic heart! </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/nov/29/band-aid-40-fails-to-reach-uk-top-40-in-opening-week\">Band Aid 40 fails to reach UK Top 40 in opening week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Arguably, there\u2019s also been a shift in us: the cash-strapped Brits. According to the 2024 Charities Aid Foundation\u2019s World Giving Index,<a href=\"https://www.cafonline.org/home/about-us/press-office/uk-falls-out-of-top-20-most-generous-countries#:~:text=It%20now%20places%2022nd%20in,by%20the%20Covid%2019%20pandemic\"> the UK has fallen out of the top 20</a> of the world\u2019s most generous countries (a decade ago, we came sixth).</p> <p>So, why do the fundraising singles keep coming?

      "bodyText": "Is the world ready for Ed Davey in a Christmas jumper, putting up tinsel with choristers, alongside violinists in reindeer antlers? The Liberal Democrat leader has joined the Bath Philharmonia to produce a Christmas charity single, Love Is Enough, in what appears to be a first for a main political party leader. Written by young carers and former carers, the song is in aid of Carers Trust and the Bath Philharmonia (as a teenager, Davey nursed his mother when she had terminal cancer). Some might think, with all that bungee-jumping and paddleboarding in the run-up to the general election, we\u2019ve already seen quite enough of \u201ccuddly Ed\u201d in 2024. But wait! Accompanied by a charming, homespun video, Love Is Enough is a sweet, uplifting song, in which Davey\u2019s gutsy vocals appear to be mysteriously reserved (Sidelined? Never!) as an occasional garnish. If Love Is Enough wants to be your 2024 festive heart-melter, the competition is fierce. There\u2019s The Celebs (including ex-boxer Frank Bruno and Love Island alumni) belting out All You Need is Love for Great Ormond Street hospital; the 18-artist Primal Live project in aid of Liverpool\u2019s Whitechapel Centre for the homeless, and more \u2026 many more. Still, is the charity single (the concept, the vibe, the fundraising flex) in danger of losing its cultural footing? Now more than 50 years old, could it be having a midlife crisis? Late Beatle George Harrison produced the first recognised charity single with Bangla Desh in 1971, raising money for Unicef to help those affected by the Bhola cyclone and the Bangladesh Liberation war. In 1984, Band Aid\u2019s Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas? was organised by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure for Ethiopian famine relief. Setting the charity single template (big stars, draughty-looking recording studio, inveterate sharing of microphones), Band Aid has been revamped every decade since. The latest 40th anniversary edition of Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas?, out last week, has failed to enter the Top 40 so far, sitting at No 45. But the original is still only outsold in the UK by another charity single, Elton John\u2019s Candle In the Wind, 1997, released to mark Diana, Princess of Wales\u2019s death. Band Aid inspired the 1985 stateside effort We Are The World, for which a scrum of A-list artists (including Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie and Cyndi Lauper) were notably instructed to \u201ccheck your ego at the door\u201d. Since then, it has been non-stop, with musical fundraising for such causes as the Grenfell Tower fire, the Zeebrugge ferry disaster, Aids research, and, recently, the Trussell Trust food bank charity, courtesy of LadBaby spoofs such as We Built This City (On Sausage Rolls). In the UK, pop and charity have become fused symbiotically in the public imagination, facilitated by telethons such as Comic Relief and Children in Need. Though for every intriguing re-reading of a classic (Lou Reed\u2019s Perfect Day, featuring Reed, David Bowie, et al), there have been a clutch of make-it-stop horrors: 1991\u2019s novelty-record bloodbath, The Stonk by Hale And Pace; The X Factor finalists\u2019 2010 nightmarishly ritzy and corporate cover of Bowie\u2019s Heroes. Indeed, as time has gone by, the impression has been that charity singles do better when they look spontaneous, homemade, disorganised, non-manufactured \u2013 basically as non-Simon-Cowelled as possible. How long can this bandwagon keep creaking along, the cynically minded may wonder. Isn\u2019t the public weary of being preached at by self-aggrandising pop stars, who think arriving at a studio in a clapped-out minicab makes them look humble and \u201cstreet\u201d? Over the years, there have also been cyclical complaints that the Band Aid behemoth is ethically dubious: stereotyping the diverse expanse of Africa and propagating a western saviour complex. On the recent anniversary, Ed Sheeran, citing a critical post by the artist, Fuse ODG, said he\u2019d not been approached for permission to re-use his 2014 Band Aid contribution for the 2024 mix, where it appears; and, had he been asked, he would have \u201crespectfully declined\u201d. For his part, Geldof says multitudes in Africa are still in need: \u201cThat little pop song has kept millions alive.\u201d Ironically, Band Aid could lay claim to being the least cynical of all charity singles: no one involved could have guessed what it would become. However, for some, disenchantment extends beyond Band Aid to all such endeavours. Once hailed as a scepticism-resistant medium spanning demographics, the charity single is now periodically condemned as an act of creative torpor and industry calculation. Critics abhor everything from the celebrity-philanthropy to charity big business to the over-simplification of complex issues. The rationale being: why not just swerve the whole shebang and donate directly to the cause? The changing times could be part of the problem. Unlike with Band Aid, there\u2019s no physical single for a hands-on buzz. Rather, it\u2019s a complicated, slightly sterile business involving downloads, streams, subscription services \u2026 be still, your beating altruistic heart! Arguably, there\u2019s also been a shift in us: the cash-strapped Brits. According to the 2024 Charities Aid Foundation\u2019s World Giving Index, the UK has fallen out of the top 20 of the world\u2019s most generous countries (a decade ago, we came sixth). So, why do the fundraising singles keep coming? Short answer: charities are desperate for your help. Talking last week of the current crisis in Sudan, the new UN undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs, Tom Fletcher, despaired of how difficult it was to get attention from the public and to raise money. Elsewhere, high-profile fundraising avenues are closing. Disparage Cowell all we like, the big-hitting X Factor Christmas charity single is no more. LadBaby retired. Valid as some criticisms of Band Aid have undoubtedly been, one might pause to wonder how critics propose to replace 40 years of international charity infrastructure? If the charity single disappeared, what would replace it? Cake sales? Fun-runs? That\u2019s a lot of self-raising flour and some very tired legs. Over the years, the charity single has been mocked, deplored, and criticised, but perhaps it\u2019s still very much needed. What\u2019s more, if the way forward is fewer glitzy power ballads and more grassroots TLC, maybe Davey (albeit accidentally, and with considerable help from the talent) has produced the perfect charity single for right now.",

So-called \u201cmodern\u201d ethics and progress are arguably based on historical Christianity. If \u201cas history fades so does truth\u201d, is it not reasonable to see truth in the historically grounded faith of Christianity, rather than disparaging those who believe? Christianity is not a system of rules for living, it\u2019s about having a relationship with a God who fulfils his righteous requirements for us. It\u2019s not about self-improvement but self-forgetfulness. It\u2019s not about gaining an individual sense of control or self but being part of a diverse community of believers.</p> <p>Thoughtful reasonable belief is neither tribally mediated nor the outworking of a \u201cmob mentality\u201d.

      "bodyText": "In response to Ashish Ghadiali\u2019s story last week (\u201cYes, there is a lot of greenwashing, but Cop summits are our best chance of averting climate breakdown\u201d, Comment, last week), nearly 70 years ago Gilbert Plass coined the term \u201cclimate change\u201d in a paper in the journal Tellus. Most of that 70 years has been spent arguing over the reality of climate change, an argument by vested interests that continues to this day. Meanwhile, global warming has continued to rise due to the burning of fossil fuels. Now, polar ice caps and glaciers are melting at an alarming rate, causing sea level rises and threatening the survival of over half the world\u2019s population living on islands and in coastal zones near sea level. The time has come to describe climate change as the \u201cBig Melt\u201d, an environment in which humans will face increasing threats from the atmosphere and the oceans for centuries to come, when the inventions and institutions of mankind will slowly collapse along with the ecologies that comprise human habitats. We need to stop fooling ourselves into thinking that humans can fix this melting problem. Humans are the problem. It is nature that is going to solve the problem by eliminating the modern human. Jeff Olson Gabriola, British Columbia, Canada The climate finance deal agreed at Cop29 will almost certainly fuel sovereign debt crises in poor countries (\u201cRow over who will pay $1tn climate fund drags Cop29 talks past the deadline\u201d, News). More than three-quarters of the $1.3tn a year for these countries will come from highly expensive private sector loans. The most vulnerable countries are already drowning in debt: our analysis shows that, on average, the governments of the countries worst affected by food crises spent almost 16% of their revenues on servicing external public debt last year. Debt restructuring and debt cancellation mechanisms that operate under the auspices of the United Nations are more urgent than ever. Such mechanisms would compel private creditors to participate in international sovereign debt treatment processes and not block progress in tackling unsustainable debt. Sunit Bagree, Senior Policy Advocacy Officer, Results UK, London SE1 Faith or self-improvement? While Martha Gill made interesting observations about the links between self-help and religion, I felt that she caricatured those with faith (\u201cNot quite religion, not quite self-help: welcome to the age of nonsense\u201d, Comment). I don\u2019t agree that modern progress is due to the \u201cfight\u201d against religion. So-called \u201cmodern\u201d ethics and progress are arguably based on historical Christianity. If \u201cas history fades so does truth\u201d, is it not reasonable to see truth in the historically grounded faith of Christianity, rather than disparaging those who believe? Christianity is not a system of rules for living, it\u2019s about having a relationship with a God who fulfils his righteous requirements for us. It\u2019s not about self-improvement but self-forgetfulness. It\u2019s not about gaining an individual sense of control or self but being part of a diverse community of believers. Thoughtful reasonable belief is neither tribally mediated nor the outworking of a \u201cmob mentality\u201d. On the contrary, such faith often means standing against popular opinion and relying on a historical truth that is relevant but not current and defensible rather than dubious. Emma Scrivener Eastbourne Martha Gill wonders about the upsurge of \u201cmystic self-help\u201d exemplified by Jordan Peterson\u2019s new book. Perhaps the words of G K Chesterton are apt: \u201cWhen (people) choose not to believe in God, they do not thereafter believe in nothing, they then become capable of believing in anything.\u201d Lance Stone London SW2 \u00a34m banana is work of satire Maurizio Cattelan is a satirist, like Banksy, but of the art, rather than political, world (\u201cSelling a piece of fruit for \u00a34m isn\u2019t bananas, it\u2019s decadent. Art is better than this\u201d, Editorial). In Comedian he is highlighting the commodification of art and how the upper echelons of the art market are dominated by \u201ccollectors\u201d with more money than sense or artistic judgment. Art spends a lot of time taking itself far too seriously, and Cattelan\u2019s satire provides a welcome invitation for it and us to lighten up a bit. Steve Rouse Hyde, Cheshire Insecure securities As Kalyeena Makortoff notes (\u201cRemember the 2008 crisis? Well, high-risk securities are back\u201d, Business), Labour\u2019s obsession with growth suggests a failure to learn the lessons of history, or even grasp the true extent of the crisis. The challenge is far greater than rebuilding the economy; we need to rebuild society and this will require challenging the role of private equity and hedge funds which concentrate wealth in ever fewer hands. Geoffrey Payne London W5 Resilience or prevention? Regarding David Robson\u2019s article on resilience interventions (\u201c\u2018Resilience interventions do work\u2019 \u2013 why coping strategies should be a staple of education\u201d, New Review), as a clinical psychologist for children and young people, the practice may miss the point of a young person\u2019s distress.

Dr Kathryn Bradley, Clinical Psychologist, Nottingham Cromwell, class operator I thought Kate Maltby was rather harsh on Cromwell (\u201cA caring Thomas Cromwell makes good TV, but beware \u2018yes\u2019 men who enable tyrants\u201d, Comment).

I love that it has a chain strap that tucks inside, so you can carry it as a clutch but have the option to go hands-free, but this bag is also a reminder to check out Monsoon\u2019s excellent Christmas party looks, which I feel not enough people know about. *** A party skirt for midi fans Gold twist-detail midi skirt, \u00a345 riverisland.com If you\u2019re not a short-skirt person, shopping for party wear can be dispiriting and weirdly alienating. Hello, The Shops, are you listening: not everyone wants to wear a bum-scraping hemline! So I love this sexy calf-length number. Wear with a lace trim cami, or just a navy jumper. Great price, too. *** Feelgood socks Sparkly silver zigzag socks, \u00a322 genevievesweeney.com Genevieve Sweeney is a sustainable and ethical brand making gorgeous sweaters, socks and gloves in small knitting factories around the UK, helping to keep this industry alive.

In corporate environments, promotions are often linked not just to individual competence but also to one\u2019s ability to collaborate, adapt, lead and engage with others in a meaningful way. If he wasn\u2019t promoted, it could indicate that he struggled with teamwork. Therapy, ideally, would help him recognise these patterns of behaviour and their wider impact, both in his professional life and his relationships. If the focus of his therapy has been almost entirely on his internal world, without connecting it to how he interacts with and affects others, it\u2019s possible he hasn\u2019t yet faced or addressed the relational aspects that may have hindered him in the past.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Name-calling you \u201ca martyr\u201d allows him to avoid facing the reality that you are overwhelmed and need support</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Good therapy doesn\u2019t just make someone more introspective; it should help them understand how they show up in different spaces, be it at work, in friendships or in a marriage. If his therapy hasn\u2019t yet made him aware of the impact he has on others, it might be that he has a limited and individualistic view of personal growth. Recognising how he affects others could lead him to greater self-awareness about not just his own needs, but also the responsibilities that come with being part of a couple.

      "body": "<p><strong>Desi Yew Tree, 44 Pool Street, Wolverhampton, WV2 4HN. <a href=\"https://desiyewtree.com/\">Desiyewtree.com</a>. No reservations. Starters \u00a34.50 \u2013 \u00a311; Sharing grill platters \u00a312 \u2013 \u00a322; Main dishes \u00a38.50 \u2013 \u00a313. Beer from \u00a34 a pint</strong></p> <p>I am but a man; as easily suggestible as any rampant digestive system attached to an equally rampant mouth. Show me a picture of a steaming bowl of ramen, the burnished rings of chashu pork peeking shyly from the cloudy broth, and I will immediately know that this is the only thing I wish to eat. Forever. Or at least for lunch. The hanging Cantonese roasted ducks, pressing their red and gold breasts to the windows of Chinatown restaurants, aren\u2019t just a serving suggestion to me. They are benign sirens, calling me irresistibly to the table. I know how sophisticated food photography has become. That doesn\u2019t stop the baser animal part of me, the bit throbbing away in some rudely undeveloped fold of my brain, demanding that I find a way to get my mouth around whatever I\u2019m looking at. I like to think of myself as discerning and sophisticated; in truth, I am merely an advertiser\u2019s dream.</p> <p>Which explains why, a few weeks ago in Wolverhampton, after interviewing the director of a new documentary about Britain\u2019s Desi pubs in front of an audience for a recording of Radio 4\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01klvhq\">Kitchen Cabinet</a></em>, I immediately jumped in a cab and directed it to one just over the ring road. Zaki Solosho, who was born and raised in London\u2019s Southall, had done such a good job of describing the allure in these brilliant places of the mixed grill, sizzling with seekh kebabs and lamb chops, chicken tikka and the rest, that I needed to be eating one. It was as simple as that.</p>    <p>The film, <em>Desi: A Pub Story</em>, commissioned by the Campaign for Real Ale (<a href=\"https://camra.org.uk/\">Camra</a>), is an intriguingly subversive piece of work. It introduces itself as a food story about pubs which house kitchens serving up dishes from across the Indian-subcontinent (to which the word \u201cDesi\u201d refers). Cue lingering shots of those smoky kebabs, and deep-sauced curries, and bubbled and blistered naan breads the size of satellite dishes.</p> <p>But the highly stimulating food porn is actually a way into an incisive piece of anthropology. It digs deep into the racism experienced by early immigrants to the UK from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, the primacy of the National Front in Southall in the 1970s, and how enterprising members of the community took over a classic institution of the very culture, which had done its best to exclude them \u2013 the pub \u2013 and made it their own. In doing so, they created places that have been so successful they have now become symbols not of exclusion, but of inclusion. The heart of the clientele is always the local Desi community. These are their places. But now they attract a very mixed crowd.</p>    <p>That\u2019s what I find when I arrive at the Desi Yew Tree, a blocky building in the city\u2019s light industrial Graiseley district, which started serving food 15 years ago. It\u2019s a 20-minute walk from Wolverhampton Wanderers\u2019 Molineux Stadium. On match days, supporters park up here for a drink before, and then come back for dinner after. Immediately inside is the bar, lined with Carling, Cobra and Madr\u00ed Excepcional on draught. To the right is the long, narrow, main dining room. To one side, behind a huge picture window so you can watch flames leap and naans being slapped into tandoors, is the kitchen. There are also multiple TV screens, some large for general viewing, some smaller and set into the wall by the booths. Tonight, all of them are screening a Liverpool v Leverkusen Uefa Champions League game. I say this as if I understand the significance of these words. I do not. I know only that men are chasing a ball across a green field and that others are shouting at them.</p>    <p>A key part of Solosho\u2019s film challenges the presumption of homogeneity with Desi pubs; that they are all basically the same thing. A community drawing on immigration from Bangladesh, Pakistan and the vastness of India is not homogeneous. It also changes with social mobility. Yes, they are always going to serve those grills and kebabs, but the menu here is not, for example, the same as at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/05/the-sportsman-club-west-bromwich-youve-won-at-lunch-restaurant-review\">the Sportsman Club</a> in West Bromwich, which I visited early last year. Here, the kitchen is a separate business to the pub and is run by the Nepalese Gaire family, which explains a few dishes described as \u201cHimalayan\u201d among the chef\u2019s specials.</p>    <p>There\u2019s the dense Himalayan fish curry, of white fillets in a thick, lightly sour gravy full of whole roasted spices, crushed curry leaves and fresh coriander. There\u2019s also Potato 65, which here has a distinct Indo-Chinese sweetness. The dry-fried potatoes are still crisp through the mustard-seed rich coating.

      "bodyText": "Desi Yew Tree, 44 Pool Street, Wolverhampton, WV2 4HN. Desiyewtree.com. No reservations. Starters \u00a34.50 \u2013 \u00a311; Sharing grill platters \u00a312 \u2013 \u00a322; Main dishes \u00a38.50 \u2013 \u00a313. Beer from \u00a34 a pint I am but a man; as easily suggestible as any rampant digestive system attached to an equally rampant mouth. Show me a picture of a steaming bowl of ramen, the burnished rings of chashu pork peeking shyly from the cloudy broth, and I will immediately know that this is the only thing I wish to eat. Forever. Or at least for lunch. The hanging Cantonese roasted ducks, pressing their red and gold breasts to the windows of Chinatown restaurants, aren\u2019t just a serving suggestion to me. They are benign sirens, calling me irresistibly to the table. I know how sophisticated food photography has become. That doesn\u2019t stop the baser animal part of me, the bit throbbing away in some rudely undeveloped fold of my brain, demanding that I find a way to get my mouth around whatever I\u2019m looking at. I like to think of myself as discerning and sophisticated; in truth, I am merely an advertiser\u2019s dream. Which explains why, a few weeks ago in Wolverhampton, after interviewing the director of a new documentary about Britain\u2019s Desi pubs in front of an audience for a recording of Radio 4\u2019s Kitchen Cabinet, I immediately jumped in a cab and directed it to one just over the ring road. Zaki Solosho, who was born and raised in London\u2019s Southall, had done such a good job of describing the allure in these brilliant places of the mixed grill, sizzling with seekh kebabs and lamb chops, chicken tikka and the rest, that I needed to be eating one. It was as simple as that. The film, Desi: A Pub Story, commissioned by the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), is an intriguingly subversive piece of work. It introduces itself as a food story about pubs which house kitchens serving up dishes from across the Indian-subcontinent (to which the word \u201cDesi\u201d refers). Cue lingering shots of those smoky kebabs, and deep-sauced curries, and bubbled and blistered naan breads the size of satellite dishes. But the highly stimulating food porn is actually a way into an incisive piece of anthropology. It digs deep into the racism experienced by early immigrants to the UK from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, the primacy of the National Front in Southall in the 1970s, and how enterprising members of the community took over a classic institution of the very culture, which had done its best to exclude them \u2013 the pub \u2013 and made it their own. In doing so, they created places that have been so successful they have now become symbols not of exclusion, but of inclusion. The heart of the clientele is always the local Desi community. These are their places. But now they attract a very mixed crowd. That\u2019s what I find when I arrive at the Desi Yew Tree, a blocky building in the city\u2019s light industrial Graiseley district, which started serving food 15 years ago. It\u2019s a 20-minute walk from Wolverhampton Wanderers\u2019 Molineux Stadium. On match days, supporters park up here for a drink before, and then come back for dinner after. Immediately inside is the bar, lined with Carling, Cobra and Madr\u00ed Excepcional on draught. To the right is the long, narrow, main dining room. To one side, behind a huge picture window so you can watch flames leap and naans being slapped into tandoors, is the kitchen. There are also multiple TV screens, some large for general viewing, some smaller and set into the wall by the booths. Tonight, all of them are screening a Liverpool v Leverkusen Uefa Champions League game. I say this as if I understand the significance of these words. I do not. I know only that men are chasing a ball across a green field and that others are shouting at them. A key part of Solosho\u2019s film challenges the presumption of homogeneity with Desi pubs; that they are all basically the same thing. A community drawing on immigration from Bangladesh, Pakistan and the vastness of India is not homogeneous. It also changes with social mobility. Yes, they are always going to serve those grills and kebabs, but the menu here is not, for example, the same as at the Sportsman Club in West Bromwich, which I visited early last year. Here, the kitchen is a separate business to the pub and is run by the Nepalese Gaire family, which explains a few dishes described as \u201cHimalayan\u201d among the chef\u2019s specials. There\u2019s the dense Himalayan fish curry, of white fillets in a thick, lightly sour gravy full of whole roasted spices, crushed curry leaves and fresh coriander. There\u2019s also Potato 65, which here has a distinct Indo-Chinese sweetness. The dry-fried potatoes are still crisp through the mustard-seed rich coating. (If you want to disappear down an internet rabbit hole, go look for the origins of the \u201c65\u201d thing, originally applied to a fried chicken dish from Chennai. It may be because it was the 65th dish on the menu. Or that it was first made in 1965. Or that the first recipe used 65 ingredients, which seems unlikely.)

Sydney-bound flight diverted to Auckland after engine trouble An Air New Zealand flight from Wellington to Sydney has been diverted to Auckland after experiencing engine trouble. Air New Zealand confirmed an engine was shut down about one hour into the flight. Flight NZ249 has now safely landed in Auckland. Here\u2019s the full statement from Air New Zealand\u2019s head of flight operations, Hugh Pearce: Flight NZ249 from Wellington to Sydney experienced an engine issue about an hour into the flight. As per Air New Zealand\u2019s standard operating procedures, the engine was shut down and the aircraft was diverted to Auckland where it landed safely just after 5.20pm. The matter will now be investigated. Customers will rebooked on the next available service. We thank them for their patience. Foreign diplomats in Australia hit with restrictions on domestic workers The Australian government has restricted foreign diplomats bringing domestic workers into the country, a UN anti-slavery expert has reported, after two recent federal court cases exposed systemic exploitation a judge described as \u201cslave-like working conditions\u201d. The United Nations special rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery concluded a visit to Australia this week, with a particular focus on temporary migrant workers across the country. Prof Tomoya Obokata said \u201ca large number\u201d of people had raised concerns with him that foreign domestic workers \u2013 brought into the country to work in the private homes of diplomats \u2013 faced widespread and largely invisible exploitation: The way the government is approaching it now, according to the information I have received, is that they are restricting the grant of those visas to a select few individuals, in order not to make it as widespread. The start of summer means there\u2019s a chance to look back on the spring that has just concluded. The Bureau of Meteorology provides some interesting stats and charts. For mean temperatures (which average out the maximums and minimums), it was Australia\u2019s hottest on record. Temperatures were 2.08C above the 1961-90 average, eclipsing the 2.03C previous record anomaly for the spring of 2020. No other springs came close to matching those two, for mean temperatures at least. The story was similar in spring for minimum temperatures, with the spring just past Australia\u2019s hottest on record. It too, was a little than 2C above the long-run average for the first time. For maximums, spring wasn\u2019t that exceptional, merely the sixth warmest on record. Mind you, the 2.1C departure from the norm is still pretty impressive (and scary). The other five hottest springs for maximums have all happened since 2013. Spring is, if I\u2019m not mistaken, the fastest warming season in Australia, and these charts help to demonstrate that pretty clear trend. As for rain, spring was above average \u2013 which will please many farmers. Southern parts of the country, though, could have done with a bit more rain. Australian representatives to address key climate conference Australia is preparing to state its position on what obligations states have to address the climate crisis and help Pacific island nations facing the existential threat. The International Court of Justice is holding oral hearings between December 2-13 to inform advice on what obligations nations have to address global heating and what the legal consequences of failing to do so are. Greens senator Steph Hodgins-May was a former environmental lawyer who worked on the early stages of the advisory opinion push with Pacific leaders. She spoke to AAP: It\u2019s a landmark moment. Anything less than a pledge to stop approving new coal and gas projects and a commitment to end subsidies for fossil fuels \u201cwill be considered a failure by those leading the case. We can\u2019t refer to the Pacific islands as Pacific family while continuing to wave through new coal and gas. A foreign affairs department spokesperson said engagement with the proceedings was \u201ca reflection of Australia\u2019s backing-in of Pacific leadership and commitment to strengthen global climate action\u201d. But the department wouldn\u2019t comment on what its submission would contain. - AAP Severe weather warning for Sydney area The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe weather warning for Sydney and surrounding regions, which may soon receive heavy rainfall, damaging winds and large hailstones. Here\u2019s the warning: A moist and unstable air mass, supported by an upper trough, is producing severe thunderstorms across eastern parts NSW. Severe thunderstorms are likely to produce damaging winds, large hailstones and heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding in the warning area over the next several hours. Locations which may be affected include Gosford, Sydney, Wollongong, Nowra, Orange, Goulburn and Dubbo. The NSW State Emergency Service has urged people to move cars undercover or away from trees, to secure loose items, and to keep at least eight metres away from any fallen power lines. NSW authorities issue warning after repeated flood rescues The NSW State Emergency Service is urging people not to drive through flood waters, after responding to more than 313 incidents and conducting nine flood rescues in 24 hours. Acting assistant commissioner, Paul McQueen, said the service had responded to 900 incidents across the state since storms began earlier this week: The nine flood rescues conducted overnight were in the Northern Rivers, Illawarra, Sydney and Western NSW regions. The Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting widespread rain, showers, and thunderstorms with moderate to heavy falls to continue into next week, increasing the risk of flash flooding and riverine rises. McQueen: The message is simple \u2013 Please never drive, ride, or play in flood waters. I also want to thank those who do the right thing and turn around to find another way. By doing this, you are saving our volunteers from being put into harm\u2019s way. You don\u2019t know what condition the road underneath the water is in and can\u2019t see hidden obstacles and debris under the surface. Flooded rivers may also contain hidden debris, snakes, spiders, chemicals and sewage.\u201d Woolworths to reopen distribution centre Supermarket chain says it will reopen a key distribution centre in Melbourne tomorrow morning, after convincing a cohort of workers to return despite ongoing industrial action. In a statement, the company said its Melbourne south regional distribution centre was the most significant of five centres currently affected by the action. Up to 1,500 employees began rolling 24-hour strikes on 21 November in warehouses in New South Wales and Victoria, seeking improved wages and safety. The campaign has led to empty shelves at many stores. Woolworths said it would reopen the centre after contacting three-quarters of its staff, with 72% indicating they wanted to return and be paid before Christmas. The United Workers Union has led 11 days of industrial action at the centre. In a statement, Woolworths called on the union to allow workers to safely return to the distribution centre: We know that there have been shortages on our shelves in some Woolworths stores and that this is really frustrating for our customers. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience and would like to thank our customers for their understanding and for treating our teams with respect. We continue to seek to negotiate with the United Workers Union and have requested that they allow safe passage for our team wishing to return to work and for vehicles tomorrow at MSRDC. This will ensure we can operate the site safely and supply much needed essential food and grocery products to our Victorian customers and communities.\u201d The Greens say they will continue to push for a deal with the Albanese government on federal environment reforms and a national gambling ad ban over the summer after a frenetic final sitting week. On Sunday, the party\u2019s Senate leader, Sarah Hanson-Young, said the issues remained \u201cunfinished business\u201d after a deal between the Greens and environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, was kiboshed by Anthony Albanese at the last minute. Hanson-Young said: I\u2019m going to be working hard over summer to make sure we can get this reform that is desperately needed on the environment front, for protecting our forests, stopping the extinction of our wildlife and driving down pollution. Our environment is at a crisis point. Nature needs us. We can\u2019t just keep having nature bulldozed off the national agenda. The Greens senator said stalled movement on both fronts was due to \u201cvested interests\u201d having a lot of influence in Parliament House. Whether it\u2019s Gina Rinehart and the mining lobby, and the loggers on the environment front, trying to drag down any inch of protection, or on the gambling reform, the big gambling lobby having their having their claws and their mitts in the government and the opposition stopping any reform, passing the parliament... About 40 teenagers were standing on a balcony on the New South Wales south coast when it collapsed late on Saturday night, injuring four teenagers. NSW police officers were called to a house on Elizabeth Drive at Vincentia, near to Jervis Bay, at about 11.30pm. The force has provided a short statement: Officers from South Coast Police District were told approximately 40 people \u2013 all aged in their teens \u2013 were on the balcony when it collapsed. Four people \u2013 three females and one male \u2013 aged in their teens were injured and were treated at the scene by Ambulance Paramedics for minor leg and back injuries and taken to hospital for further treatment. Analysis reveals supermarkets\u2019 most promoted porducts Health and beauty products are the most frequently promoted products at major supermarkets, a new Guardian Australia analysis shows, with shampoos and conditioners among the items that are almost permanently on sale at Coles and Woolworths. The big grocery retailers also heavily promote unhealthy foods, which are often displayed prominently near checkouts and at the end of aisles, despite an anticipated government clampdown on such selling tactics. Promotions are typically funded either solely by a product manufacturer, or through an agreement between the manufacturer and the supermarket to share the reduced profit margins, in expectation of increased sales. Multinationals usually wield the biggest marketing budgets. Fatal car accident in regional NSW Two people have died after a two-vehicle crash near Muswellbrook in regional NSW on Saturday afternoon. According to police, officers were called to reports of a head-on-crash involving two sedans on Denman Road, Edderton, around 5.30pm. Police say a woman believed to be in her 70s, who was driving one of the cars, died at the scene. A man believed to be in his 20s, who was a passenger in the second car, also died at the scene. Another man and two other women aged in their 20s were also treated at the scene by paramedics. Police said a crime scene has been established. A report will be prepared for the coroner. Warning plastic waste found in food and garden waste \u201cMassive amounts\u201d of plastic contamination is getting into food and garden waste through user error and misleading \u201cbiodegradable\u201d labelling, waste industry experts have warned. Leading figures at some of Australia\u2019s largest waste companies are calling for the government to standardise certification of compostable products, as many bin liners, compostable coffee cups and other material labelled \u201ccompostable\u201d or \u201cbiodegradable\u201d do not break down into organic matter. The warnings come as states across the country are introducing food and organic waste collection programs in households in an attempt to halve the amount of food waste that ends up in landfill by 2030. In NSW, councils will be required to collect food and organic waste from all households by 2030. Boy in Perth hospitalised after being struck by car An 11-year-old has been hospitalised with serious injuries after allegedly being struck by a Toyota Land Cruiser in Perth. According to Western Australia police, the boy was allegedly struck while crossing the intersection of Jersey Street and Hay Street in the suburb of Jolimont, in the city\u2019s west. Police say the boy was crossing the street with his mother, who was not injured. The force says the 18-year-old driver was also unharmed. Police are now investigating what has been described as \u201ca serious crash\u201d and are examining the scene. Burke explains rejection of visa for former Israeli minister Continuing with Tony Burke\u2019s appearance on Sky News this morning, the home affairs minister has defended his decision to reject a visa for former Israeli minister, Ayelet Shaked. Shaked was due to visit Australia for a speaking tour before her entry was rejected. Burke said Shaked\u2019s visit would have undermined social cohesion, noting he did not want to import hatred from overseas: Whether those hatreds are demeaning of Israelis or demeaning of Palestinians, I\u2019m going to have the exact same hard line \u2026 my view is really simple \u2013 if you\u2019re simply coming here to demean people, we can do without you. The home affairs minister said Shaked had publicly expressed \u201chorrific\u201d views about Palestinians in Gaza, including referring to Palestinian children as \u201csnakes\u201d. Burke said \u201cwe don\u2019t need that in Australia\u201d. Burke \u2018very grateful and respectful\u2019 of negotiations with Indonesia over Bali Nine Tony Burke will be discussing the future of the remaining so-called Bali Nine members with his Indonesian counterpart during a visit to the south-east Asian nation this week. The Bali Nine were nine young Australians arrested in 2005 for attempting to smuggle 8kg of heroin to Australia. Two of the group, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, were sentenced to death and executed in 2015. Five others remain in jail. On Sky News this morning, Burke declined to say anything further about whether the convicted drug smugglers might serve the remainder of their sentences in Australia after any negotiations. Burke said: I\u2019m very grateful and respectful of Indonesia. It\u2019s got its own justice system. I\u2019m very respectful and grateful that they want to be able to have that conversation, and I\u2019ll be approaching that conversation with a good deal of humility and listening to where the Indonesian government\u2019s up to. Tests to NSW\u2019s energy system possible again this week Summer is officially under way, but a lot of eastern Australia had a warm late spring. As we saw last week, it didn\u2019t take a lot of heat to stress the power grid, especially when so much of the coal-fired generation capacity was offline for maintenance. You can read our review of the week but also what\u2019s expected in coming months, particularly for NSW and Victoria, in this piece: Even though a couple of big coal units should be back on line from this weekend, it looks like there may be a few tight periods this week too. For instance, the Australian Energy Market Operator was this morning calling for more reserve generation to be made available for tomorrow. The market is likely to respond but it\u2019s a reminder that we can expect similar calls from the operator each time there is a lengthy hot spell in coming months especially if the warmth stretches over a couple of big population centres (eg Melbourne and Sydney, or Sydney and Brisbane). Woman discovers snake crawling up her leg while driving on Melbourne freeway A Melbourne woman was forced to flee her car barefoot after discovering a deadly tiger snake was slithering up her leg while driving. According to Victoria police, the woman had been travelling at 80km/h on the Monash Freeway when she felt something on her foot: Remarkably, she was able to fend the snake off her and weave through traffic before pulling over and leaping out of her car to safety. Police were called to the scene after reports the woman, who was stranded on the side of the freeway, was trying to flag down other cars: Still in a state of shock and needing to ensure she wasn\u2019t bitten; the driver was assessed by paramedics while police pondered on how to deal with the snake. The tiger snake is the fourth most venomous snake in the world. It was eventually removed from the car by Melbourne Snake Control. Passing motorists were left in bewilderment as the massive snake was safely removed from the vehicle. Earlier this morning, the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, dismissed concerns about a mass deportation of non-citizens after tough new laws were introduced as \u201cbizarre speculation\u201d. The migration law changes, which passed parliament late on Thursday night, allow Australia to pay third countries to take non-citizens. In November, home affairs department officials confirmed about 80,000 people in Australia are on a removal pathway, but stressed many return to their home countries voluntarily. Burke told Sky News on Sunday the new powers were simply an \u201cextra tool\u201d for the government. I\u2019m not about to make some big, grand announcement of a mass deportation, or anything like that. This is an extra tool that we should have had, that we now have available, and I\u2019m glad we got the support to get that through the parliament. The Aukus partnership is a form of \u201cAsian Nato\u201d, the Taiwanese government says, after welcoming further transits of Australian warships through the Taiwan Strait to counter China\u2019s military activity. The Taiwanese deputy foreign affairs minister, Francois Wu, said that the proposal floated by the Japanese prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, for a Nato-like security pact in Asia would probably anger Beijing. Here\u2019s what Wu told a group of Australian reporters at the ministry of foreign affairs in the capital Taipei: Maybe it\u2019s not good for the stability of the region. But having said that \u2026 Aukus, in some way, is another form of an Asian Nato. You just don\u2019t need to call [Aukus] Nato, but it is a real Nato. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is an alliance of 30 European and two North American nations set up to defend each other against attacks by third parties. In a joint statement, Australia, the UK and US earlier this year said they were consulting with New Zealand, Canada and South Korea to identify possibilities for collaboration on capabilities under Aukus Pillar II, which covers advanced capabilities. \u2013 AAP Melbourne tobacco store allegedly set alight after being rammed by car A tobacco store in Melbourne\u2019s northern suburbs was allegedly rammed by a car in the early hours of Sunday morning, before being set alight. Fire Rescue Victoria says the fire, which \u201cextensively damaged\u201d the store, will now be investigated by Victoria police: Crews arrived on scene within five minutes to find a car had penetrated the front of a single storey brick shop, with flames issuing from the building. Wearing breathing apparatus, firefighters worked quickly to attack the fire with hose lines. Crews successfully prevented the fire from spreading to the neighbouring apartment building. No one was injured by the fire, which was extinguished about 4.40am by 25 firefighters. Residents living next to the store were evacuated as a precaution. Vanuatu climate envoy says bid for ICJ ruling about delivering \u2018the results we need to survive\u2019 Vanuatu\u2019s special envoy on climate change, Ralph Regenvanu, has spoken to the ABC about the country\u2019s historic bid for the international court of justice to rule on the climate crisis. The UN\u2019s top court will begin hearings on Monday, with 15 judges to determine on the obligation of nations to prevent climate breakdown, as well as consequences for inaction. Regenvanu, who has written a piece on this issue for Guardian Australia, told the ABC that industrialised nations were \u201cnot doing what needs to be done to maintain a positive future for the world\u201d. The voices of smaller states in vulnerable nations \u2013 the ones that have not been responsible for climate change but are suffering the worst effects \u2013 are always overshadowed in climate negotiations. The results we need to survive are not being achieved. You can read Regenvanu\u2019s piece here: Albanese tight-lipped on discussions with incoming Trump administration As we\u2019ve mentioned, Anthony Albanese kept a lot of cards close to his chest during his interview this morning on ABC\u2019s Insiders. Another one of those was on interactions with the incoming US president, Donald Trump. The US president-elect has been creating a storm of headlines around the world over his intention to impose heavy tariffs on imports into the US. As Insiders host, David Speers, noted, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, paid Trump a visit to his Mar-a-Lago resort recently to discuss the proposed 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican goods. Heavy tariffs could also be placed on Chinese imports, which the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has already warned will have economic flow-on effects for Australia. Asked whether Albanese might pay Trump a snap visit over the summer, the prime minister stayed mum: I\u2019m doing the job I was elected to do. I\u2019ve had a productive discussion with President Trump and it was very positive. Albanese was also asked about Trump\u2019s pick for the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. Trump\u2019s decision to choose the former US congresswoman has been scrutinised due to her history as a vocal critic of \u201cwarmongering\u201d US foreign policy and sympathetic commentary on Russia. So, should Australia be comfortable with sharing national secrets with the US if Gabbard is confirmed as its top intelligence official? Albanese said: The relationship between Australia and the United States is a strong one. It\u2019s never been stronger than it is right now, and as Five Eyes partners, we cooperate through our intelligence agencies, and I\u2019m sure that we\u2019ll continue to do so in the future. The health minister, Mark Butler, is holding a press conference in Adelaide to announce the endometriosis drug Visanne will be added to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. It\u2019s the first listing of an endo treatment in three decades. This is a condition that impacts more than 1 million women \u2013 one in seven women and teenage girls \u2013 and for too long, too many women have been made to suffer in silence. [They\u2019ve] been told by many healthcare professionals, it has to be said, that this is \u201cnormal\u201d. That it is a normal part of period pain or many other explanations for debilitating, crippling pain. Butler said endometriosis was responsible for as many as 40,000 hospitalisations each year. He said the number of hospitalisations has increased by 40% in the last decade. This is all about providing cheaper medicines and cutting-edge treatment to Australian patients generally, but [particularly] in the area of endometriosis, which has attracted such inadequate support for hundreds of thousands of Australian women. This listing is beyond time. Brisbane records warmest spring on record Brisbane has recorded its warmest spring in 75 years of record keeping, with day and night temperatures almost 1C above the long-term average. Weatherzone analysis says this is mostly due to an increase in minimum temperatures, in addition to a mid-season heatwave: The major contributor to the record has been the minimum temperatures, which averaged 17.2\u00baC over the spring season for the site, and were elevated by cloud cover, precipitation, and most notably, humidity. \u2018Certainly our intention\u2019 to resume parliament in March, Albanese says, with election \u2018between now and May\u2019 We\u2019re still none the wiser when the federal election will be after the prime minister\u2019s appearance on ABC\u2019s Insiders this morning. It\u2019s a major conversation topic in Canberra circles whether there will be an early election in March or earlier, or whether Anthony Albanese will send Australians to the polls in May as long predicted. Albanese said his \u201cstarting point\u201d in government is to lead for three years and then \u201cwork back from that\u201d. The prime minister said three-year terms are \u201ctoo short\u201d and believes Australia should have fixed four-year terms. So will parliament resume in March as scheduled? Albanese said \u201cthat\u2019s certainly our intention\u201d. Keep your eye on the white car with the flag on the front. At some point between now and May it will go to Government House. But there won\u2019t be an election on New Year\u2019s Day or New Year\u2019s week on 3 January. I can confirm that. Albanese refuses to say which countries Australia would pay to take non-citizens Anthony Albanese has remained tight-lipped on which third countries the federal government could send non-citizens to after the laws were passed with Coalition support this week. The powers allow the government to pay third countries to receive non-citizens, as well as create criminal penalties for non-citizens who refuse to cooperate with their own deportation, and new powers to search for drugs and confiscate phones in immigration detention. But the countries they could be sent to remain unknown. Albanese declined to give any further details on ABC\u2019s Insiders: What we won\u2019t do is make those announcements on Insiders on a Sunday morning. What this does is give the government power to engage with third countries to make sure that we protect Australia\u2019s national interest. Albanese said \u201cwe\u2019ve done what\u2019s necessary\u201d when asked why mobile phones were also banned in detention centres: Before the last election, there was some questioning of our resolve, what we\u2019ve been determined to do is to show our strong commitment to keep Australians safe. We have kept Operation Sovereign Borders fully in place. No one who has arrived here by boat has been allowed to settle here. We\u2019ve done what\u2019s necessary. \u2018Technology changes really quickly\u2019: Albanese says social media ban details to be worked out over coming months Speaking on ABC\u2019s Insiders, Anthony Albanese says the details of the under-16s social media ban will be worked out over the next 12 months before the laws kick in, noting \u201ctechnology changes really quickly\u201d. The laws passed parliament on the final sitting on Thursday, preventing Australians under 16 from accessing social media platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, X and the message board Reddit. Some messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, are expected to be excluded. How the laws will work, including how social media platforms will be able to determine users\u2019 ages, is yet to be revealed. The prime minister said: We have 12 months but what we will do is [what] we\u2019ve outlined in the legislation. One of the things the legislation makes clear as well is that because technology changes really quickly, we\u2019ve made sure that the legislation doesn\u2019t have to be adjusted every time there\u2019s a shift in technology, so there are some powers with the minister. As for whether Australians will have to hand over identification to social media sites to access them, Albanese said the \u201cobligations will be on them\u201d to figure it out. Anthony Albanese says it\u2019s still his intention to pass its nature positive laws after a deal with the Greens was scuppered by him during the last sitting week. The Western Australian premier, Roger Cook, said he had spoken to the \u201chighest level\u201d of the federal government on Tuesday to reiterate his view that the bills in their current form \u201cshould not be progressed\u201d. The government\u2019s legislation would have established two new agencies: an environmental watchdog to manage compliance with national environmental laws and an information agency to manage environmental data. Negotiations between the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, and the Greens senate leader, Sarah Hanson-Young, had been progressing through the week, which would have secured the necessary support to pass it. On ABC\u2019s Insiders on Sunday morning, the prime minister said he had told the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, Hanson-Young, and finance minister, Katy Gallagher, in a meeting but had also informed Plibersek. Albanese said: It\u2019s our intention to proceed with them but we\u2019ll proceed with them on the basis of our values that we put forward. These laws could have been carried at any time over recent months if the parliament had the numbers to vote for them \u2026 we will hold to our values. We won\u2019t allow any tail to wag the dog. We want to make sure that that happens. The endometriosis drug, Visanne, is about to become the first endo treatment to be subsidised by the federal government in 30 years. The health minister, Mark Butler, will announce the listing of Visanne on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) at St Andrews hospital in Adelaide this morning. The drug is taken daily and works to shrink and suppress the growth of abnormal tissue. Without a subsidy, it can cost Australians with endometriosis about $750 a year. Butler said the PBS listing would be \u201ca gamechanger\u201d for the roughly one in seven Australian women who suffer from endometriosis: For too long, women living with endometriosis have had to struggle in silence. Women are suffering unnecessarily. They\u2019re having their experiences dismissed, being called hysterical and accused of drug shopping. Women\u2019s pain is real and it\u2019s time we stop telling women to just suck it up. A 31-year-old man has been charged for the alleged murder of a man and a woman at a shop in western Sydney. The bodies of the 69-year-old man and a 68-year-old woman were found with \u201csignificant injuries\u201d on Saturday morning, with police describing the scene as \u201cconfronting\u201d. NSW police allege the man and woman were known to the accused, who was arrested at a home in Canley Heights, in the city\u2019s west, in the early hours of Sunday morning. The man was taken to Fairfield police station where he was charged with two counts of murder (DV). He was refused bail to appear at the Parramatta local court later on Sunday. NSW police were called to the shop on Oxford Street in Cambridge Park about 9.40am on Saturday after reports of an alleged assault. The bodies were first discovered by a family member, police have said. Det Acting Supt Michael Cantrell told reporters on Saturday the family of the couple were \u201cobviously devastated\u201d and \u201cassisting police\u201d. Major funds boost for mental health, addiction services Children, pregnant women and people with mental health conditions will receive better support for alcohol and drug issues in a major funding boost, AAP reports. The $235m package, expanding or establishing more than a dozen services, comes as policing, health and political leaders prepare to chart a new course for drug policy in NSW. Some $6.4m across four years has been set aside to provide early intervention for 11 to 17-year-olds with moderate to severe substance use. Funding will also be directed to programs targeting pregnant women, Aboriginal people, people with mental health conditions and people in the criminal justice system. The NSW health minister, Ryan Park, said the funding would significantly boost the alcohol and other drug workforce including those with Indigenous or lived experience backgrounds: The programs we are investing in will ensure that people with complex needs receive wrap-around support and care to help people recover and rebuild their lives in the community. Welcome to our live news coverage of 1 December. Is that really the date? December! We\u2019re starting the day with news that NSW police has arrested a 31-year-old man in Sydney\u2019s west for the alleged murder of a man and woman in their late 60s. Being a Sunday, there\u2019s going to be the usual round of federal politicians on morning media shows. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, will be on Insiders shortly after 9am. Stick with us throughout the day!",

Travelling on foot and by boat, with Monique in their arms, they went more than 100 miles from her birth village, Babadi, in the southern central Kasa\u00ef province in the Belgian Congo, to her new lodgings, the Catholic mission of the sisters of Saint-Vincent-de Paul in Katende. It was 1953 \u2013 the year Joseph Stalin died and Queen Elizabeth II was crowned \u2013 and Belgium still ruled the Congo, a vast African territory 75 times its size.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/11/drc-map/giv-455929W7VP58X0ET/\" data-alt=\"DRC map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/11/drc-map/giv-455929W7VP58X0ET/\">Interactive</a> <figcaption>DRC map</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Decades later, Monique remembers herself on the first day at the mission: a tiny girl lost in a crowd, looking everywhere for her family, who had to leave her there. \u201cI cried, I cried, I cried, there was no one.\u201d An older girl gave her a slice of mango and took her in her arms. \u201cFrom that day it was the end of my life with my family,\u201d she recalls.</p> <p>Monique Bitu Bingi was one of many mixed-race children forcibly separated from their parents and sequestered in religious institutions by the Belgian state that ruled Congo, Burundi and Rwanda. Her Congolese mother was 15 when she was born; her father was 32, a colonial official from a well-to-do family in Li\u00e8ge. Monique\u2019s existence \u2013 and thousands of other mixed-race children known as<em> </em><em>m\u00e9tis </em>(mixed race) \u2013 deeply alarmed the Belgian state, which viewed these babies as a threat to the white supremacist colonial order.</p> <p>Now more than 70 years after being taken away from her mother, Bitu Bingi and four other women have accused Belgium of crimes against humanity for their forced removal and placement in religious institutions.<strong> </strong>Bitu Bingi brings the case with L\u00e9a Tavares Mujinga, No\u00eblle Verbeken, Simone Ngalula and Marie-Jos\u00e9 Loshi, whom she describes as sisters. All five arrived in the Katende mission between 1948 and 1953, aged three and four; the last left in 1961.</p> <p>The five women, four of whom live in Belgium and one in France, await a ruling from Belgium\u2019s court of appeal this week, in what is likely to be a charged moment in the country\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/12/belgium-forced-to-reckon-with-leopolds-legacy-and-its-colonial-past\">reckoning with its colonial past</a>.</p>    <p>The case has thrown a spotlight on the state-sponsored seizure and segregation of children that is little known. It was a system where breastfeeding toddlers were taken from their mothers; family names and even birth dates were changed; and children were lodged hundreds of miles from their homes, only to be abandoned by the state in the violent chaos of Congo\u2019s independence in 1960.</p> <p>It was a system underpinned by menace. Bitu Bingi discovered years later that her uncle, the family\u2019s main breadwinner, was threatened with military service at a distant outpost if he did not give her up. Desperate mothers used wax or other substances to blacken their children\u2019s skin to try to hide them.</p> <p>But the colonial state was determined to find these infants as it grappled with what officials in the late 1940s called \u201cthe mulatto problem\u201d, an offensive term to describe mixed-race people<strong>.</strong> Joseph Pholien, a lawyer who went on to become a Belgian prime minister after the second world war, described Congo\u2019s mixed-race children in 1913 as \u201can element that could very quickly become dangerous\u201d and imperil the colonial enterprise: \u201cNo remedy is radical enough to avoid the creation of <em>m\u00e9tis.</em>\u201d</p> <p>Arriving at the mission in 1953, Monique\u2019s life was put on a different track. She was told that her father now was \u201c<em>Papa</em> <em>l\u2019\u00e9tat</em>\u201d (\u201cdaddy the state\u201d), she said in an interview with the <em>Observer</em> from her home in the east Belgian town of Tongres, near the Dutch border.</p> <p>This new father was neglectful at best. Monique was hungry nearly all the time. The children\u2019s main meal of the day was fufu (a polenta-like dish), served with vegetables or sweet potato leaves. There was no breakfast. The girls never saw milk, meat or eggs. Monique\u2019s bed in the shared dormitory was against a door that opened into the morgue \u2013 the mission was also a hospital.</p> <p>The girls, shoeless most days, went to school in the village, but knew they were not like the other children. They were \u201cchildren of sin\u201d, the nuns said. When they fell sick, there was little medicine and less care \u2013 the nuns resented their role as state guardians. In dispatches to headquarters, officials complained about the difficulties of finding institutions to house children snatched from their parents.</p>    <p>Life could have continued this way until Monique became an adult. But when she was 11, Belgium\u2019s rule of the Congo came to an abrupt end that no one in Brussels had imagined a few years earlier. After stalling on independence and struggling to contain deadly riots, Belgium bowed to pressure and agreed to cede power. The date was set: on 30 June 1960, the charismatic founder of the first nationwide Congolese political party, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/patrice-lumumba\">Patrice Lumumba,</a> became prime minister of the newly independent nation aged 34. At the handover ceremony, Lumumba denounced the outgoing colonial regime \u2013 which had been responsible for the death of millions \u2013 for \u201cthe humiliating slavery imposed upon us by force\u201d.</p> <p>The Belgians, represented by King Baudouin, were stunned. Some argued that the African leader signed his own death warrant with the speech, but Lumumba also had enemies at home.</p> <p>Days after independence, the army mutinied and Lumumba\u2019s government lost control. Rebels in the mineral-rich province of Katanga declared independence, and Lumumba struggled to get international help from a UN riven by cold war rivalries. In January 1961, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/jan/17/patrice-lumumba-50th-anniversary-assassination\">the young prime minister was assassinated by firing squad</a> in Katanga by Congolese rebels, with Belgian officers present. A Belgian parliamentary inquiry in 2001 found that Belgian government ministers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/17/humanities.research\">bore \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d</a> for events leading to his murder. The Belgian king knew of the plans to kill Lumumba but did nothing to save him, MPs concluded.</p> <p>As the country fell into chaos, Belgians scrambled to leave. The Katende girls were told they were going to be evacuated to Belgium. Monique and her friends were excited. \u201cWe were going to take the plane to go and live with <em>Papa l\u2019\u00e9tat</em>\u201d and \u201cour godmother\u201d, then reigning Queen Fabiola, she recalled. But the nuns flew off without them.</p> <p>And so began a time of peril for Monique and the other girls, having been entirely abandoned by \u201c<em>Papa l\u2019etat</em>\u201d. Shunted back to Katende, their normal life collapsed. The older children were left to care for babies. There was not enough food, and many of the infants died. Fighting raged outside the walls. Monique recalls UN and Ghanaian soldiers driving up to evacuate the priests and remaining nuns. The children were left behind: \u201cThey abandoned us again.\u201d</p> <p>Then the local militias arrived. The girls became \u201cthe toy\u201d of local soldiers. At night, they came for the girls, stripped them naked and raped them. In the day, they brought severed hands of killed enemy fighters into the mission as trophies.</p> <p>More than 60 years later, the horror of these days is so seared into her memory that a backfiring car or siren blaring in her sleepy local street pitches her back into the deadly chaos of Katende. \u201cThere are times when you ask yourself, was this really true? Did I experience this? But it was like this and, yes, I lived through this.\u201d</p> <p>During these terrifying days, she had no way of tracing her family. Her mother thought she had been rescued with the nuns. Years later, Monique reconnected with her mother, but the bond was never the same: \u201cI loved her very much and I know that she loved me also. But we never had [close] ties, the ties had been broken.\u201d</p> <p>Monique Bitu-Bingi married in 1966 and lived in the Congo, eventually moving to Belgium in 1981, seeking a better quality of life for her family. Arriving in Tongres, she had no right to Belgian citizenship, which she eventually acquired in 1999 after a long legal battle, despite having been brought up as a ward of the state. \u201c<em>Papa l\u2019\u00e9tat</em> did nothing,\u201d she recalls.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018At times you ask yourself: did I experience this?

One of the women, Loshi, according to her lawyers, filed an application for Belgian citizenship as early as 1994 from Kinshasa, but was told by the Belgian authorities she would never be successful as such applications \u201cdidn\u2019t work for the <em>m\u00e9tis</em>\u201d. She eventually settled in France.</p> <p>Mich\u00e8le Hirsch, a lawyer, heard Bitu Bingi\u2019s story for the first time in 2018. She and the four other women came to her office on the upmarket Avenue Louise in Brussels. Seated around a glass table on minimalist black chairs, they recounted a childhood of forced removal, hunger, rape and abandonment. Hirsch, who had previously represented victims of the genocide in Rwanda, was not sure at first what to do. The people in charge of the policy had long since died, she thought. But she saw \u201cthe courage they had to put this story in our hands\u201d and turned to the archives.</p> <p>What she found, she told the <em>Observer</em>, was \u201ca systematic policy to identify, track and pursue mixed-race children, taking them from the arms of their mothers and forcing them under the guardianship of the state\u201d. This policy was made possible by two late-19th century decrees from when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/12/belgium-forced-to-reckon-with-leopolds-legacy-and-its-colonial-past\">King L\u00e9opold II</a> ran the Congo as his own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/may/13/features11.g22\">private fiefdom</a>. After the second world war, it was strengthened by a 1952 law that said children could be removed from their parents \u201cfor any reason whatsoever\u201d.</p>    <p>\u201cThe legislator in 1952, after the judgments of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/20/nuremberg-war-crimes-trials-begin-1945\">Nuremberg</a>, after the war, adopted a racial law that allowed children to be placed under the power of the state\u2026 uniquely because they were <em>m\u00e9tis</em>,\u201d Hirsch said. She told the court there were \u201ctroubling similarities\u201d with the Nazi policy of seizing children of German-Polish parents, which was also condemned at Nuremberg.</p> <p>The Belgian government argued that while the policy did not reflect modern values, it was not a crime at the time. A lower court agreed. In a judgment in 2021, the Tribunal of First Instance also said: \u201cThe fact [these acts] are unacceptable\u2026 is not sufficient to also allow them to be qualified, in law, as crimes against humanity.\u201d It ordered the women to pay \u20ac6,000 (\u00a35,000) to the state. Under Belgian law, plaintiffs are required to pay a proportion of their opponents\u2019 costs, although the judgement will only be enforced if they lose on appeal.</p> <p>The Belgian foreign ministry declined to give an interview or to provide information on the state\u2019s arguments, saying: \u201cWe never comment on ongoing legal cases.\u201d The law firm Xirius, which represented Belgium at the tribunal, did not respond to requests for an interview. Some legal scholars have offered support to Belgium. The late professor of international law, Eric David, <a href=\"https://www.levif.be/belgique/metis-du-congo-belge-crimes-contre-lhumanite-les-experts-sont-divises-debat/\">told Belgium\u2019s Le Vif in 2020</a> that: \u201cThe crimes against humanity judged at Nuremberg in 1945-46 had nothing comparable to the forced placement of mixed-race children in religious institutions.\u201d</p> <p>Hirsch is hopeful the appeal will succeed, saying that her team has brought thousands of unseen documents \u201cout of the dust\u201d of the archives that demonstrate how the policy worked. Lawyers have drawn on the work of Assumani Budagwa, an independent researcher, who came to Belgium as a refugee in 1979 from DR Congo (then known as Zaire), and has spent nearly three decades uncovering the unknown history of these stolen children. \u201cIt is a shameful page, it is a painful page, and to bring it into the open is not easy, like all the pages of history concerning violence and atrocities when the colonial propaganda spoke of civilisation,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Belgium has made hesitant progress in confronting the past. In a landmark resolution in 2018, its parliament recognised that the <em>m\u00e9tis</em> had been victims of \u201ctargeted segregation\u201d and \u201cforced removals\u201d. A year later, then prime minister Charles Michel <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47817530\">made an official apology</a>, focusing on children removed from their African mothers between 1959-1962 and sent to Belgium. The Belgian state, he said, had \u201ccommitted acts contrary to the respect of fundamental human rights\u201d.</p> <p>But a two-year special commission on the colonial past set up by the Belgian parliament after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/12/belgium-forced-to-reckon-with-leopolds-legacy-and-its-colonial-past\">Black Lives Matter protests</a> has gone nowhere. A 729-page report with dozens of recommendations finalised nearly two years ago has been gathering dust because of political deadlock over the question of an official apology for the entire colonial period.</p>    <p>This week, the five women will hear the decision of the appeal court, housed at the monumental Palais de Justice in Brussels. If they lose their case, they can appeal to Belgium\u2019s highest court of the judiciary, the court of cassation, but only on a point of law. The five women are seeking \u20ac50,000 in compensation each. It is a \u201cvery small\u201d amount, Hirsch said, because if they lose, they must pay the state compensation, calculated as a proportion of their claim.</p> <p>Budagwa, the researcher, thinks that the state fears paying reparations if it loses. When Michel made his apology, it was reported that 20,000 children were affected by the policy, but Budagwa believes this is an inflated figure not based on historical evidence. Researchers for <a href=\"https://www.metis.arch.be/\">R\u00e9solution-M\u00e9tis,</a> an official body, are investigating how many children were removed from their parents, but said sources were \u201cdeficient and fragmentary\u201d.</p> <p>For Monique Bitu Bingi, an apology is too little. \u201cFor a human life, saying sorry isn\u2019t enough. I want the state to assume its responsibility, to recognise [what happened] and make reparation. Because we were destroyed, mentally and physically.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Monique was three years old when a white man from the government came to her village and changed everything. Everyone came out to see him, including Monique, who, as always, was with her \u201clittle auntie\u201d, a girl of nine who was also her best friend. Monique cannot recall what the man looked like, but she remembers how sad everyone was after he had gone. Her mother had tears in her eyes that night. Monique would not see her for a long time. The next day, Monique set off early with her uncle, aunt and grandmother on a three-day journey. Travelling on foot and by boat, with Monique in their arms, they went more than 100 miles from her birth village, Babadi, in the southern central Kasa\u00ef province in the Belgian Congo, to her new lodgings, the Catholic mission of the sisters of Saint-Vincent-de Paul in Katende. It was 1953 \u2013 the year Joseph Stalin died and Queen Elizabeth II was crowned \u2013 and Belgium still ruled the Congo, a vast African territory 75 times its size. Decades later, Monique remembers herself on the first day at the mission: a tiny girl lost in a crowd, looking everywhere for her family, who had to leave her there. \u201cI cried, I cried, I cried, there was no one.\u201d An older girl gave her a slice of mango and took her in her arms. \u201cFrom that day it was the end of my life with my family,\u201d she recalls. Monique Bitu Bingi was one of many mixed-race children forcibly separated from their parents and sequestered in religious institutions by the Belgian state that ruled Congo, Burundi and Rwanda. Her Congolese mother was 15 when she was born; her father was 32, a colonial official from a well-to-do family in Li\u00e8ge. Monique\u2019s existence \u2013 and thousands of other mixed-race children known as m\u00e9tis (mixed race) \u2013 deeply alarmed the Belgian state, which viewed these babies as a threat to the white supremacist colonial order. Now more than 70 years after being taken away from her mother, Bitu Bingi and four other women have accused Belgium of crimes against humanity for their forced removal and placement in religious institutions. Bitu Bingi brings the case with L\u00e9a Tavares Mujinga, No\u00eblle Verbeken, Simone Ngalula and Marie-Jos\u00e9 Loshi, whom she describes as sisters. All five arrived in the Katende mission between 1948 and 1953, aged three and four; the last left in 1961. The five women, four of whom live in Belgium and one in France, await a ruling from Belgium\u2019s court of appeal this week, in what is likely to be a charged moment in the country\u2019s reckoning with its colonial past. The case has thrown a spotlight on the state-sponsored seizure and segregation of children that is little known. It was a system where breastfeeding toddlers were taken from their mothers; family names and even birth dates were changed; and children were lodged hundreds of miles from their homes, only to be abandoned by the state in the violent chaos of Congo\u2019s independence in 1960.

She was told that her father now was \u201cPapa l\u2019\u00e9tat\u201d (\u201cdaddy the state\u201d), she said in an interview with the Observer from her home in the east Belgian town of Tongres, near the Dutch border.

The late professor of international law, Eric David, told Belgium\u2019s Le Vif in 2020 that: \u201cThe crimes against humanity judged at Nuremberg in 1945-46 had nothing comparable to the forced placement of mixed-race children in religious institutions.\u201d Hirsch is hopeful the appeal will succeed, saying that her team has brought thousands of unseen documents \u201cout of the dust\u201d of the archives that demonstrate how the policy worked. Lawyers have drawn on the work of Assumani Budagwa, an independent researcher, who came to Belgium as a refugee in 1979 from DR Congo (then known as Zaire), and has spent nearly three decades uncovering the unknown history of these stolen children. \u201cIt is a shameful page, it is a painful page, and to bring it into the open is not easy, like all the pages of history concerning violence and atrocities when the colonial propaganda spoke of civilisation,\u201d he said. Belgium has made hesitant progress in confronting the past. In a landmark resolution in 2018, its parliament recognised that the m\u00e9tis had been victims of \u201ctargeted segregation\u201d and \u201cforced removals\u201d. A year later, then prime minister Charles Michel made an official apology, focusing on children removed from their African mothers between 1959-1962 and sent to Belgium. The Belgian state, he said, had \u201ccommitted acts contrary to the respect of fundamental human rights\u201d. But a two-year special commission on the colonial past set up by the Belgian parliament after the Black Lives Matter protests has gone nowhere. A 729-page report with dozens of recommendations finalised nearly two years ago has been gathering dust because of political deadlock over the question of an official apology for the entire colonial period. This week, the five women will hear the decision of the appeal court, housed at the monumental Palais de Justice in Brussels. If they lose their case, they can appeal to Belgium\u2019s highest court of the judiciary, the court of cassation, but only on a point of law. The five women are seeking \u20ac50,000 in compensation each. It is a \u201cvery small\u201d amount, Hirsch said, because if they lose, they must pay the state compensation, calculated as a proportion of their claim. Budagwa, the researcher, thinks that the state fears paying reparations if it loses. When Michel made his apology, it was reported that 20,000 children were affected by the policy, but Budagwa believes this is an inflated figure not based on historical evidence. Researchers for R\u00e9solution-M\u00e9tis, an official body, are investigating how many children were removed from their parents, but said sources were \u201cdeficient and fragmentary\u201d. For Monique Bitu Bingi, an apology is too little. \u201cFor a human life, saying sorry isn\u2019t enough. I want the state to assume its responsibility, to recognise [what happened] and make reparation. Because we were destroyed, mentally and physically.\u201d",

But the Indian government, and Suri himself, have denied any wrongdoing. Suri told the Guardian Shergill was a diplomat and her case could only be resolved by Indian authorities.</p> <p>Shergill has never been paid her unpaid wages.</p> <p>In a further judgment in August this year, Sri Lankan mother of two <a href=\"https://www.judgments.fedcourt.gov.au/judgments/Judgments/fca/single/2024/2024fca0918\">Priyanka Danaratna was awarded more than half a million dollars \u2013 $543,300</a> \u2013 in unpaid wages and interest.

      "bodyText": "The Australian government has restricted foreign diplomats bringing domestic workers into the country, a UN anti-slavery expert has reported, after two recent federal court cases exposed systemic exploitation a judge described as \u201cslave-like working conditions\u201d. The United Nations special rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery concluded a visit to Australia this week, with a particular focus on temporary migrant workers across the country. Prof Tomoya Obokata said \u201ca large number\u201d of people had raised concerns with him that foreign domestic workers \u2013 brought into the country to work in the private homes of diplomats \u2013 faced widespread and largely invisible exploitation. \u201cThe way the government is approaching it now, according to the information I have received, is that they are restricting the grant of those visas to a select few individuals, in order not to make it as widespread.\u201d Obokata said he was told the government was also \u201cintensifying the information campaign\u201d directed towards diplomatic missions, so that domestic workers were not exploited. \u201cI think it is the job of the federal government to make sure that the diplomatic community are fully aware of the working conditions and rights and entitlements and making sure that is enforced. I think-awareness raising is quite important.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Two recent federal court cases have brought the sustained, systemic domestic worker exploitation to public prominence. In 2023, Indian national Seema Shergill was awarded $189,000 in unpaid wages and interest after working in Australia for a year earning less than $2,500 \u2013 about $9 a day. The Indian high commissioner who employed her, Navdeep Suri Singh, was this year fined $97,200. But the Indian government, and Suri himself, have denied any wrongdoing. Suri told the Guardian Shergill was a diplomat and her case could only be resolved by Indian authorities. Shergill has never been paid her unpaid wages. In a further judgment in August this year, Sri Lankan mother of two Priyanka Danaratna was awarded more than half a million dollars \u2013 $543,300 \u2013 in unpaid wages and interest. Danaratna worked seven days a week, on average for 14 hours a day, for three years in Australia, during which she had only two days off, both of which were spent in hospital. Danaratna had her passport seized, was not allowed outside and she told the court she was not given enough food. She was grossly exploited, paid just 65 cents an hour. Her employer, Sri Lankan diplomat Himalee Arunatilaka, did not respond to repeated requests for comment, but her government said the domestic worker was paid a mutually agreed salary. Arunatilaka is now Sri Lanka\u2019s permanent representative to the UN, based in Geneva. Danaratna has not been given her unpaid wages. In her judgment in the Shergill case, Justice Elizabeth Raper condemned the \u201cslave-like working conditions\u201d of some domestic workers, saying some spend their entire existence \u201centrapped within domestic servitude\u201d. \u201cTheir invisibility breeds exploitation.\u201d Government departments declined to comment on how diplomatic domestic worker visas \u2013 part of the subclass 403 category \u2013 were being restricted in the wake of these cases: whether diplomatic missions where exploitation had been uncovered were being blacklisted from visas, or whether a broader restraint on visas had been imposed. Dfat told the Guardian it \u201cmakes clear to all foreign missions \u2013 through established policy and regular communications \u2013 the Australian government\u2019s expectation that they adhere strictly to Australian laws and community expectations on pay, conditions, and standards of treatment.\u201d A spokesperson for home affairs said domestic workers were only granted visas with written support from Dfat, and \u201cevidence of employment contract that complies with the Fair Work Act\u201d. Department of home affairs officials speak with domestic workers as part of the visa application process, and flag concerns about possible exploitation with Dfat. More broadly, the special rapporteur, in his interim report, said he was \u201cseriously concerned by the treatment of temporary migrant workers in Australia\u201d, including domestic workers in diplomatic homes, Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (Palm) scheme workers, working holiday visa holders, and people on student visas. \u201cI received credible information from a large number of stakeholders, including workers themselves, which clearly reveals disturbing, sometimes very serious, patterns of exploitative practices by employers, labour hire companies and migration agents,\u201d Obokata said. He cited evidence of deceptive recruitment, underpayment, racial discrimination, dangerous working conditions, harassment, threats of and actual violence, including sexual and gender-based violence. Obokata said workers who left exploitative employers to take jobs in the informal economy faced further exploitation and abuse. \u201cThese workers are also vulnerable to sexual and criminal exploitation by other actors. Many of these conditions may amount to contemporary forms of slavery.\u201d Obokata said the fundamental issue plaguing temporary work schemes in Australia was that they created a significant power imbalance between employers and workers, with workers generally tied to a single employer and dependent upon that employer for their right to work and even remain in the country. \u201cThe power imbalance undoubtedly leads to under-reporting among workers, which in turn results in impunity among employers, labour hire companies or immigration agents.\u201d The NSW anti-slavery commissioner, Dr James Cockayne, said the special rapporteur\u2019s report was \u201ca wake-up call to governments at all levels in Australia\u201d. \u201cWhile the special rapporteur rightly applauds recent progress, his statement highlights significant modern slavery risks facing temporary migrant workers, international students, people with disabilities and sex workers. \u201cProf Obokata joins a growing chorus of expert voices calling for Palm workers to be given greater labour market mobility and protections from exploitation.\u201d President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Michele O\u2019Neil, said the special rapporteur\u2019s report echoed the longstanding position of the union movement. \u201cAll temporary migrant workers must have the ability to change their employer, this includes workers on the Palm programme, who are effectively bonded to their employer sponsor, meaning the employer essentially controls their paycheque and their passport \u2013 a huge modern slavery risk.\u201d",

Very happy with the way we fought, particularly when we were put under pressure on day two. To go from 40 for 3 to 499 was very nice, and I thought our bowlers were relentless the whole time. So yeah, a very good start.</p> <p>[On Harry Brook\u2019s 171] You need luck at times but you have to make it count. When the opposition are dropping catches left, right and centre you do want to go on and make a big score, Brooky always seems to find the funny side of everything but he\u2019s an incredible player, an incredible talent, and he\u2019s constantly looking to put pressure on the opposition regardless of the situation. He\u2019s going from strength to strength as a player.</p> <p>[On Brydon Carse] Amazing. I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to grow up with Brydon at Durham and I\u2019ve always known how much talent and potential he had. To see him come into the team and make such a big impact so early in his career is amazing. He\u2019s an absolute workhorse; he charges in all day whether the conditions are in his favour or not. We saw that in Pakistan. To see him get the rewards this week was amazing.</p> <p>[On Jacob Bethell] Chasing those little targets can sometimes be a bit difficult. Everyone knows how we take them on, and Beth came into his own in that little period. He\u2019s been playing like that all summer in the white-ball team so it was nice to see him do it in whites.</p> <p>[On his 80 in England\u2019s first innings] Yeah it was good. I batted slightly down the order. When Gus and Carsey came in and started hitting sixes, I was sort of giving them the strike and thinking, \u2018Hang on, I should be doing that role\u2019. </p> <p>[On his injury, although he doesn\u2019t specify whether it was his hamstring] It\u2019s been a heavy week, with a lot of time in the field. I bowled 20 overs and I hurt my back diving in the field as well. It was just management more than anything else. I\u2019ll be raring to go in Wellington.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-674bc3ee8f08613772568519\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-12-01T02:07:04.905Z\">2.07am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Tom Latham\u2019s reaction</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After being put in on that surface we were happy with our score and the position we had them in [71 for 4]. We had our opportunities. On a different day those catches go to hand and the outcome might be different, but unfortunately that\u2019s the sport we play.</p> <p>Some days it just doesn\u2019t fall your way. Guys certainly don\u2019t mean to drop catches. That\u2019s cricket and hopefully we can do better next time.</p> <p>When you play a quality time like England, who put you under pressure, sometimes those mistakes can hurt you. We\u2019re all working extremely hard to keep producing runs and wickets and that won\u2019t change.</p> <p>For us it\u2019s always about trying to stay level. Things haven\u2019t gone our way here but we\u2019ll get another opportunity in a few days.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-12-01T02:07:32.047Z\">at 2.07am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-674bc2d88f088c7046fe08f2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-12-01T02:03:11.270Z\">2.03am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The player of the match is the seriously impressive Brydon Carse</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s very satisfying to be able to win as a team. We were thrown different challenges throughout the game but as a group we stuck to certain plans and we got our rewards.</p> <p>Everyone contributed in different ways. We had different fields for each bowler, there were conversations with Stokesy throughout both innings and it all paid off towards the end.</p> <p>The surfaces in Pakistan were obviously very different to this. There\u2019s more carry and bounce here which suits my style of bowling. Yeah, I\u2019m very happy with my personal performance.</p> <p>Me and Gus [Atkinson] have quite a good relationship off the field and we had a good conversation about our batting last night.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for tonight. Ali Martin\u2019s report will appear shortly, as if by magic, and we\u2019ll be back for the second Test later in the week. Bye! Yeah, very good. Very happy with the way we fought, particularly when we were put under pressure on day two. To go from 40 for 3 to 499 was very nice, and I thought our bowlers were relentless the whole time. So yeah, a very good start. [On Harry Brook\u2019s 171] You need luck at times but you have to make it count. When the opposition are dropping catches left, right and centre you do want to go on and make a big score, Brooky always seems to find the funny side of everything but he\u2019s an incredible player, an incredible talent, and he\u2019s constantly looking to put pressure on the opposition regardless of the situation. He\u2019s going from strength to strength as a player. [On Brydon Carse] Amazing. I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to grow up with Brydon at Durham and I\u2019ve always known how much talent and potential he had. To see him come into the team and make such a big impact so early in his career is amazing. He\u2019s an absolute workhorse; he charges in all day whether the conditions are in his favour or not. We saw that in Pakistan. To see him get the rewards this week was amazing. [On Jacob Bethell] Chasing those little targets can sometimes be a bit difficult. Everyone knows how we take them on, and Beth came into his own in that little period. He\u2019s been playing like that all summer in the white-ball team so it was nice to see him do it in whites. [On his 80 in England\u2019s first innings] Yeah it was good. I batted slightly down the order. When Gus and Carsey came in and started hitting sixes, I was sort of giving them the strike and thinking, \u2018Hang on, I should be doing that role\u2019. [On his injury, although he doesn\u2019t specify whether it was his hamstring] It\u2019s been a heavy week, with a lot of time in the field. I bowled 20 overs and I hurt my back diving in the field as well. It was just management more than anything else. I\u2019ll be raring to go in Wellington. Tom Latham\u2019s reaction After being put in on that surface we were happy with our score and the position we had them in [71 for 4]. We had our opportunities. On a different day those catches go to hand and the outcome might be different, but unfortunately that\u2019s the sport we play. Some days it just doesn\u2019t fall your way. Guys certainly don\u2019t mean to drop catches. That\u2019s cricket and hopefully we can do better next time. When you play a quality time like England, who put you under pressure, sometimes those mistakes can hurt you. We\u2019re all working extremely hard to keep producing runs and wickets and that won\u2019t change. For us it\u2019s always about trying to stay level. Things haven\u2019t gone our way here but we\u2019ll get another opportunity in a few days. The player of the match is the seriously impressive Brydon Carse It\u2019s very satisfying to be able to win as a team. We were thrown different challenges throughout the game but as a group we stuck to certain plans and we got our rewards. Everyone contributed in different ways. We had different fields for each bowler, there were conversations with Stokesy throughout both innings and it all paid off towards the end. The surfaces in Pakistan were obviously very different to this. There\u2019s more carry and bounce here which suits my style of bowling. Yeah, I\u2019m very happy with my personal performance. Me and Gus [Atkinson] have quite a good relationship off the field and we had a good conversation about our batting last night. He scored more runs but I just edged him with the sixes. 12.3 overs: England 103-2 (Bethell 50, Root 23) A perfect finish for England, with Jacob Bethell reaching his maiden Test fifty while hitting the winning runs. He hooked Smith for a big six, uppercut two more to move to 49 and then pulled a single to deep square. In the first innings Bethell fought doggedly to make 10 from 34 balls; today he smashed 50 from 37. 12th over: England 95-2 (Bethell 41, Root 23) Thanks Tanya, hello everyone. England don\u2019t muck about in runchases, do they. Root moves them closer to victory with a breezy pick up for six off O\u2019Rourke, a shot that could only be played by somebody who is a) a genius and b) playing with total freedom. Nine to win. But first, a drinks break. 11th over: England 86-2 (Bethell 39, Root 16) Southee signs mini-bats on the boundary as Bethell picks up yet another four \u2013 a floppy O\u2019Rourke can\u2019t stop the music on the rope. Nine from the over, 18 to win, and I\u2019ll hand over to Rob Smyth to carry you through the final throes of this match. Thanks for all your messages \u2013 good night! 10th over: England 77-2 (Bethell 33, Root 14) Bethell wriggles four from O\u2019Rourke\u2019s bouncer \u2013 and New Zealand think they have him next ball caught behind. But the umpires \u2013 both on pitch and behind the screen- disagree. 9th over: England 71-2 (Bethell 28, Root 13) Three dots, a no ball and three singles makes Smith a temporarily happy boy. 8th over: England 67-2 (Bethell 26, Root 12) England cruising. Root slips into Duckett\u2019s shoes and slides three consecutive fours under the door \u2013 the first a risky whisk through the slips, the second a charming drive, the third, a short ball pulled handsomely. \"\u2018OBO\u2019ers still awake\u2019?! Surely a category error, Tanya? Or is it just a tautology? I have no opinion on the apostrophe btw. [oh you rotter Brian Withington] Interesting batting in passing \u2026 Duckett hits one straight into the bucket (hands of Matt HEnry at deep third). He tips his head back in disappointment. 7th over: England 55-1 (Duckett 27, Bethell 26) New Zealand suddenly on the wrong end of a spanking here. 16 from the over as Bethell wipes four fours off new bowler Smith \u2013 the best a planking straight past the bowler with a sneer and a heel-rubbed cigarette. 6th over: England 39-1 (Duckett 27, Bethell 10) Bethell joins in as he disrepectfully wangs Henry through long-off. 5th over: England 31-1 (Duckett 26, Bethell 4) Biff-bash-boosh. Duckett isn\u2019t hanging around as he crashes Southee for two fours and a six from the over. 4th over: England 15-1 (Duckett 10, Bethell 4) Henry probes, but a thick inside edge off Bethell\u2019s bat flies past the diving keeper for four. \u201cI\u2019m currently trapped in purgatory, otherwise known as trying to get home from deansgate [my sympathies] on a Saturday near Christmas, and wondering what Crawley\u2019s recent average is? Obviously looking for something more accurate than \u201cshite\u201d! At least Duckett has just started providing some entertainment!\u201d Well, Michael Robinson, cricinfo tells me that in the seven Tests Crawley has played since July this year \u2013 he has made six single figure scores and only twice passed 29. 3rd over: England 11-1 (Duckett 10, Bethell 0) After Duckett is given a three-ball working over by Southee, he shuffles, hops, and scoops four down to fine leg. Four more follows as the next ball is flicked away. 2nd over: England 1-1 (Duckett 0, Bethell 0) Alas, poor Crawley. Another disappointed trudge home. OBO\u2019ers still awake may like to know that England have only once failed to chase a target of 102 or fewer: the 1882 Test that led to the creation of the Ashes. They needed 85 and were bowled out for 77. Crawley plonks his big foot down the pitch and hits the ball straight back to Henry who holds on with one hand at hip height. 1st over: England 1-0 (Crawley 1, Duckett 0). Another blast of Jerusalem on the Barmy trumpet. Tim Southee immediately on the money. A honeyed peach fifth ball beats Duckett\u2019s bat and skims the top of off stump. A discombobulated Duckett then flings the bat wildly to the last delivery. Here come Crawley and Duckett. Will today be their dancing day? Shane Bond is impressed by Brydon Carse. \u201cTen wickets away from home \u2013 the last man to that in New Zealand was Ryan Sidebottom. I liked his combativeness, he was really clear about his plans and ran in hard all day.\u201d Talk trickling in from the camp suggests that Stokes has a stiff lower back \u2013 and stepping away from bowling was a precautionary rather than urgent measure. Time for me to stretch my legs \u2013 back shortly. No news yet on Stokes, who pulled up half way through an over mid-morning. Presumably he is now being forced to sit down with a cold compress and a cup of tea. Mitchell drives \u2013 but this time straight to long off. New Zealand start to walk off, but all is paused while the umpires check for a non-existent no-ball. Finally given the go-ahead, they stroll off for lunch. A smashing innings from Mitchell, excellent defence from O\u2019Rourke and Carse finishes with 6-42 and ten in the match. He leads England off, ball in hand. 74th over: New Zealand 254-9 (Mitchell 84, O\u2019Rourke 5) Green, green grass, blue, blue skies and O\u2019Rourke declines another single. Even the Barmy Army have gone quiet. David Gower asks someone to explain \u201cice-ice baby\u201d 73rd over: New Zealand 252-9 (Mitchell 83, O\u2019Rourke 5) A maiden from Carse, who replaces Bashir. \u201dI\u2019ll take John Wailes\u2019 shout out (approx half an hour ago) in the spirit I believe was intended,\u201d mulls Brad Mcmillan \u201dI can think of little more tediously exciting than the prospect of an England test match resolution on Sunday morning happening before the end of a gloriously turgid Saturday night snooker semi-final, and simultaneously watching both live while tipsy after a rare night in the pub. \u201dI might think differently in 24hrs time, but that\u2019s for future me to worry about!\u201d Tedious excitement. One for the ECB marketing gurus. 72nd over: New Zealand 252-9 (Mitchell 83, O\u2019Rourke 5) The last over before lunch isn\u2019t the last over before lunch as I think we\u2019re taking the extra half hour. The field comes in after three balls and Mitchell says thanks very much and rolls his wrists for four. Four more follows through square leg. At 43, this is now the second biggest stand of the innings in just over 10 overs, behind only Williamson and Mitchell\u2019s 69. 71st over: New Zealand 244-9 (Mitchell 75, O\u2019Rourke 5) Mitchell breaks the spell with a hop and a skip and a SIX flayed straight and high. A possible first boundary in Test cricket by O\u2019Rourke (in his eighth Test) is hauled back from the rope, so he has to contend with a first three \u2013 which brings him to his highest Test score! 70th over: New Zealand 233-9 (Mitchell 67, O\u2019Rourke 2) A bird\u2019s-eye camera shows a beautiful set of striped pitches surrounding the cut strip. Woakes goes again, screams past the outside edge of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s bat. 69th over: New Zealand 232-9 (Mitchell 66, O\u2019Rourke 2) O\u2019Rourke, long stubborn legs, Bashir long lanky legs. A single. 68th over: New Zealand 231-9 (Mitchell 65, O\u2019Rourke 2) A maiden from Woakes, as O\u2019Rourke, who has made a virtue of never playing a shot, dutifully blocks. He has been in two or three Test partnerships of 30-odd where he has just left it to his partner to score. \u201cThey\u2019re line dancing and singing country songs between racks in the Mosconi Cup in Florida,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cAnd that\u2019s just the players. Maybe somebody should tell Mark Allen and Barry Hawkins?\u201d 67th over: New Zealand 231-9 (Mitchell 65, O\u2019Rourke 2) Bashir with the first over of spin today. Under instruction from the umpires, he pulls a plaster off his bowling thumb \u2013 no plasters allowed on the bowling fingers, which, I\u2019m afraid, is news to me. Bashir got a bit of tap yesterday after collecting wickets for fun in the first innings. A semi-chance at slip, but Brook can\u2019t get a hand to it. Mitchell ends the over with a sharp reverse-sweep for four. And we go on \u2013 the lead 80 and inching towards irritating. 66th over: New Zealand 225-9 (Mitchell 60, O\u2019Rourke 1) Atkinson tiptoes in at speed. Mitchell lands a handsome blow through point, where it flies away for four. \u201cCan I just say Happy Birthday to my fellow Sagittarian Andy, celebrating his silver wedding anniversary with longsuffering Sian. Apparently they\u2019re in Timaru which is only 160 kms from Christchurch.\u201d Consider it done, Finbar Anslow. Happy Birthday Andy! 65th over: New Zealand 220-9 (Mitchell 50, O\u2019Rourke 1) Mitchell glances at that full list of O\u2019Rourke Test innings - 0*, 0*, 0*, 2, 0, 2*, 0*, 0*, 0*, 0, 1*, 2*, 0 \u2013 and innovates with a flicky salt throw over his left shoulder for four. 64th over: New Zealand 215-9 (Mitchell 50, O\u2019Rourke 1) Rourke\u2019s highest Test score is 2. Time for Mitchell to get cracking. 63rd over: New Zealand 215-9 (Mitchell 50, O\u2019Rourke 0) Time for Chris Woakes, who raises his beautiful eyebrows and races in, slightly barrel chested. Mitchell eases to his 13th Test fifty, from 132 balls. Reliable glue. \u201cShout out to anyone flicking between the most horrendous game of snooker since 1984 and the Test match,\u201d writes John Wailes. \u201cSaturday night for the ages.\u201d It does sound like Mark Allen and Barry Hawkins is a bit of a slog \u2013 and not in a T20 way. 62nd over: New Zealand 210-9 (Mitchell 47, O\u2019Rourke 0) A no-ball and a wide nudge New Zealand\u2019s lead up to 60. Will Mitchell go big now? \u201cNay, Tanya, Nay and thrice Nay! A dog is The Hundred. Continually demanding our attention, constantly on guard for threats and an irritation when all you want is an August afternoon watching Lancashire make 127 all out and Somerset reply with 225-1.\u201d Gary Naylor, I will never be able to read your County Cricket Talking Points in the same way. Southee clears the decks for take-off once more, but this time the ball flies to Joe Root at deep midwicket, who accepts with both hands as he flops to earth. 61st over: New Zealand 209-8 (Mitchell 47, Southee 12) Ade Couper has his pencil hovering over the England card. \u201cWas mulling over the England batting order- is there a case for Stokes batting at 3, then have Pope keep wicket &amp; bat at 6 or 7? Stokes on his day is more than equal to batting at 1st down, while Pope can have a similar role to, say, Moeen or Alec Stewart, ie being a reliable middle/late order batter?\u201d My bones say no. Mitchell knocks an easy single and Carse dives to stop, ends up pancake flat on his stomach. 60th over: New Zealand 207-8 (Mitchell 48, Southee 12) Southee, on his farewell tour, has a huge slog at Atkinson. Misses. Then gets a toe end which is well stopped by a diving Pope. Finally gets bat on ball and gives Atkinson a taste of his own medicine by swinging with style and clocking SIX. And another one! Legs wide apart, bang over deep square, and just over Joe Root. He does have previous\u2026 \u201cI\u2019m proud to say I have a cat sat either side of me. Eros and Hera,\u201d taps Alistair Connor. \u201c They show no interest in the rugby I\u2019m watching : catching up on Ireland-Aus. I no longer feel the visceral hatred a true Kiwi is supposed to feel for any Australian sports team (possibly because I have a daughter in Melbourne), and this crew are very entertaining.\u201d They take DRINKS. 59th over: New Zealand 194-8 (Mitchell 45, Southee 0) Carse continues. In the background hands reach into cool bags. And why not. The lead, incidentally, is 43 Hello Guy Hornsby! \u201cSaturday night and where else would we be but watching Test cricket, Tanya? Rock, and indeed, roll. I\u2019m still pleasantly surprised by how England went overnight last time, and while they\u2019re odds-on to win this, it feels they\u2019re letting too many easy runs so far this session. [This was sent about 20 mins ago \u2013 Ed] \u201c(P.s. we have a new cat, Ziggy, in our house and I can confirm that this 6-month old ball of black furry greatness is much more T20 than Test, but he\u2019s only young!)\u201c Gorgeous. These are my current feline companions: 58th over: New Zealand 193-8 (Mitchell 45, Southee 0) Not a good sign. Stokes stops bowling after three balls and hands the job to Atkinson. He doesn\u2019t go off the field but this will be a big worry for England. Atkinson promptly scones Southee on the grill. ON. THE. MONEY. Full and fast. Henry doesn\u2019t bother reviewing. Carse has his first Test five fer and England are suddenly on the charge. 57th over: New Zealand 192-8 (Mitchell 44, Southee 0) Five wickets for Carse, to match four in the first innings. What a few months he\u2019s had \u2013 a betting ban followed by international honours and a speedy adjustment to the demands of Test cricket. Smith reviews but more in hope than expectation. It crashes into his knee roll and would have hit the top of leg stump. 56th over: New Zealand 190-6 (Smith 21, Mitchell 43) Stokes huffs and puffs. A lovely looking shot from Smith, a push through the covers \u2013 brings three. With half an hour gone, New Zealand are looking remarkably untroubled. 55th over: New Zealand 184-6 (Smith 17, Mitchell 41) Carse, shirt untucked as always, sprays in a few more bouncers and Smith ducks happily beneath. All good energy for Brendan McCullum thinking Ashes bound a year on. 54th over: New Zealand 182-6 (Smith 15, Mitchell 41) Stokes continues. Throws in a no ball. And another as a tricksy bounces forces Smith to duck. New Zealand have resisted for 20 doughty minutes. Mitchell, who averages 72 against England, continues his thorn-like progress. 53rd over: New Zealand 176-6 (Smith 12, Mitchell 40) \ufeff\u201cMorning / Evening Tanya. New Zealand and England are always worth watching, but it will take something special for the Black Caps to turn this around. So, your friend has kittens you say? Are they watching, or busy making you biscuits for lunch? We got two kittens back in the summer, after 15 years as dog owners. Sisters who we named Margo and Olive. They are magnificent creatures. Cats are the animal world equivalent of Test cricket I reckon. They know they\u2019re the best, and pity anyone who doesn\u2019t agree. If I could watch Test cricket with a cat by my side for eternity, I\u2019d be a happy man.\u201d The kittens are adorable (Paris and Stella) but I must disagree Simon McMahon. The dog is the pet equivalent of Test cricket . 52nd over: New Zealand 172-6 (Smith 11, Mitchell 37) While the cat on the carpet in front of me plays with a carrot attached to a fishing rod, Stokes charges in. The sky is blue, the hills are bonny, the ground is full. Another four slips through the cordon. 51st over: New Zealand 166-6 (Smith 10, Mitchell 32) The dangerous Brydon Carse bounds in like a hungry panther. Smith pings him for two consecutive fours, one guided cleverly between slip and gully. 50th over: New Zealand 157-6 (Smith 2, Mitchell 32) Stokes starts with a loosener as the Barmy Army riff through a full-throated Jerusalem. Stokes\u2019 hair is Compton Brylcreem with touch of mullet. A couple of singles gets the Kiwis up and running. David Gower is ringing the starting bell and Ben Stokes has the ball. Here we go. Chris Woakes is taking David Gower through the Kane Williamson plan. \u201cIdeally you get him out early, that\u2019s when he\u2019s most vulnerable. I think about fourth/fifth stump that\u2019s where everyone\u2019s susceptible. Then its all a about using the crease. It is nice when an over comes together like that.\u201d Mmmmm. 25 degrees with a nice breeze, and an oatmeal pitch. Bon soir Alistair Connor in Lyon: \u201cIt\u2019s very decent of the Guardian to OBO overnight Tests. My routine is to follow until midnight, then go to bed and in the morning, try to scroll back without learning the score so I can maintain the suspense while I catch up. Gummy half-closed eyes are an advantage. I could probably get a free-to-air NZ TV feed, but then I \u2018d have to stay up all night. \u201cThis series has huge potential. Our lot go one down, no doubt, but the sides are well-matched.\u201d It\u2019s definitely a tasty side-dish to the run-up to Christmas. \u201cA nice flat pristine surface,\u201d says Jeremy Coney, looking neat and trim. \u201cFor a day four surface, it looks pretty good and if you can get yourself in, runs are available. The Wisden editor rubs it in: Play is due to start at 10pm GMT. While you\u2019re waiting, read about Harry Brook having jam on his toast. Hello! In this tail-chasing Test cricketing winter, where Sri Lanka chased New Zealand who chased India who chased Australia, England (chased down in turn by Pakistan) now close their jaws on the frisky Kiwi tail. With a lead of just four, and only four wickets in hand, New Zealand will struggle to keep the crowds, lolling deliciously at the gorgeous Hagley Oval, entertained after lunch, let alone into day five. England utilised day three to the full \u2013 Harry Brook blissing out with yet another score of 150 plus, Ben Stokes with a restrained 80 and some plentiful biffing by Carse and Atkinson. Henry finished with four wickets, Smith with three. New Zealand, who dropped eight catches as England rocked and rolled towards 500, faltered early in their second innings. Williamson orchestrated a steady-as-she-goes recovery, but Chris Woakes outwitted him - Williamson and new man Blundell caught in successive balls. Three wickets too for the unstoppable Carse. I\u2019m in my friend\u2019s lovely house in Marlow, being entertained by their kittens. Wherever you are, do drop me a line.",

Police said they were called to Monash Freeway near the Toorak Rd exit in Melbourne\u2019s eastern suburbs on Saturday morning after receiving reports of a barefoot woman trying to flag down passing traffic. The woman told police she had been driving on the freeway when she felt something on her foot and looked down to find a snake \u201cslithering up her leg\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email It was later identified as a tiger snake, one of the world\u2019s most venomous snakes, that had curled up under the steering wheel of the car. Police said that \u201cremarkably\u201d the woman was able to fend off the snake and weave through traffic before pulling over in the slip lane and leaping out of her car to safety. Paramedics were called to make sure the woman \u2013 who police said was in a state of shock \u2013 had not been bitten. A spokesperson for Ambulance Victoria said they couldn\u2019t find any puncture marks or other signs the woman, aged in her 40s, had been bitten. She was taken to the Alfred hospital in a stable condition for further observation at about 11.30am, the ambulance spokesperson said. Police said they called snake catcher Tim Nanninga from Melbourne Snake Control to wrangle the snake safely and get it out of the car. \u201cPassing motorists were left in bewilderment as the massive snake was safely removed from the vehicle,\u201d a police spokesperson said. \u201cAnd so ended one of the more bizarre welfare checks you\u2019ll ever hear about.\u201d Nanninga said he didn\u2019t know how the woman managed to pull over safely. \u201cI do feel sorry for the lady that was driving \u2013 it would have been absolutely terrifying,\u201d he said. He said he received six to 12 requests a year to remove snakes from cars but this was the first time he had been called to a freeway. \u201cThere were about a million people filming,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just not used to doing it in front of such a big audience, to be honest.\u201d Nanninga said the woman had travelled from south-west Victoria, which is where the snake is believed to have got into her car and then under the dashboard. He said the snake was taken to a reptile vet and checked for parasites. He was given the all clear to release it in a local catchment area, which he said was a \u201csafe place right away from people and pets\u201d. Tiger snakes can be found across much of Victoria, including in highly populated areas. The Victorian environment department has identified them as one of the most venomous snakes in the world, and says all tiger snakes should be regarded as \u201chighly dangerous\u201d to humans.",

Patel, 44, has worked as a federal prosecutor and a public defender but rose to prominence in Trump circles after expressing outrage over the agency\u2019s investigation into whether Trump\u2019s campaign conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. He has called for the FBI leadership to be fired as part of a drive to bring federal law enforcement \u201cto heel\u201d. If confirmed, Patel would replace Christopher Wray, the FBI director who was appointed by Trump in 2017 after the then president fired James Comey over the FBI\u2019s Russia collusion inquiry. Comey later testified to Congress there was no evidence of any collusion but the FBI had a \u201cbasis for investigating\u201d the matter. Patel had ties to former Republican representative Devin Nunes, who led opposition to the Russia investigation by special counsel Robert Muller while serving as chair of the House intelligence committee. In making his nomination for FBI director, Trump said in a statement on Truth Social that Patel \u201cis a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and \u2018America First\u2019 fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People\u201d. \u201cKash will work under our great Attorney General, Pam Bondi, to bring back Fidelity, Bravery, and Integrity to the FBI,\u201d Trump added. Trump noted Patel\u2019s service as chief of staff at the department of defense, deputy director of national intelligence, and senior director for counter-terrorism at the national security council during his first term.

If confirmed by the Senate \u2013 Gina Haspel, CIA director during Trump\u2019s first term, reportedly threatened to resign in 2020 when Trump sought to install Patel as her deputy \u2013 Patel will likely prove a loyal agent of Trump\u2019s desire to reform what the president-elect considers Washington\u2019s bureaucratic overreach. Patel told the Conservative Political Action Conference in July it was necessary to \u201cidentify the people in government that are crippling our constitutional republic\u201d. Trump has called Patel\u2019s 2023 book Government Gangsters, in which he argued for firing of government employees who undermine the president\u2019s agenda, a \u201cblueprint to take back the White House\u201d. The reforms Patel outlined in the book \u201cto defeat the deep state\u201d include moving the FBI headquarters from Washington to \u201ccurb FBI leadership from engaging in political gamesmanship\u201d and to reduce the general counsel\u2019s office, which he claimed had taken on \u201cprosecutorial decision-making\u201d.",

In the video, titled \u201cSoon \u2026 Time is running out\u201d and posted on Saturday on the Telegram channel of Hamas\u2019s military wing, the Qassam Brigades, Alexander calls on Trump to use his \u201cinfluence and the full power of the United States to negotiate for our freedom\u201d. Alexander, who has been held by Hamas since 7 October 2023, appears to be under duress as he states that he has been held captive for more than 420 days. \u201cPlease do not make the mistake Biden has been doing,\u201d he says, adding that he does not want to \u201cend up dead like my fellow USA citizen, Hersh\u201d, a reference to American-Israeli Hersh Goldberg Polin, who was killed while being held by Hamas in August. Alexander\u2019s family authorized the release of the video, which includes footage of the young captive covering his face with his hands and crying. In a statement, national security council spokesperson Sean Savett said the war in Gaza \u201cwould stop tomorrow and the suffering of Gazans would end immediately \u2013 and would have ended months ago \u2013 if Hamas agreed to release the hostages\u201d.

Last week, Biden said there existed \u201ca critical opportunity to conclude the deal to release the hostages, stop the war, and surge humanitarian assistance into Gaza\u201d. But the video is directed squarely at the president-elect, who held a picture of Alexander while meeting with his parents, Adi and Yael, in New York on the one year anniversary of the Hamas attack. At an event in Florida later that day, Trump called the attack \u201cone of the darkest days in all of history\u201d before pivoting to blame then presidential rival and vice-president Kamala Harris and Biden for the \u201cweakness\u201d he said gave Hamas confidence to launch the attack. Yael Alexander told rallygoers at \u201cHostage Square\u201d in Tel Aviv on Saturday that she was \u201cshaken by the video\u201d and had spoken with Netanyahu. She said the Israeli leader had \u201cstrengthened me and assured me that now, after the deal in Lebanon, the conditions are ripe to release you and bring you home\u201d, referring to a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon that went into effect on Wednesday.

      "bodyText": "Islamist rebels once exiled to a mountainous pocket of the Syrian countryside now roam the streets of central Aleppo, taking pictures below its ancient citadel and tearing down symbols of President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s rule. The surprise offensive in which insurgents seized territory across north-western Syria appears to have dramatically shifted the balance of power in Aleppo, the country\u2019s second largest city, and marks the most serious challenge to Assad\u2019s control in years. On Saturday night, images emerged of fighters pushing deep into Syrian government-controlled territory towards the city of Hama, including Kafr Nabl, a town once seen as symbolic for its opposition to Assad. Within hours, video showed insurgents in the centre of Hama. Syria\u2019s state news agency, Sana, quoted military sources denying reports of a rebel advance in Hama, adding \u201cour armed forces have a reinforced defensive line\u201d. Sana said government forces were repelling insurgent advances with the help of Russian aircraft, while opposition networks reported air strikes in the Idlib countryside. Fighters from the militant Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) seized much of Aleppo less than a day earlier in a sudden rout of Syrian army forces. A reporter with the opposition television channel Aleppo Today showed uniformed militants in an empty central plaza. Footage showed people tearing down a statue of Bassel al-Assad, the brother of Syria\u2019s ruler, to the sound of celebratory gunfire. Turkey\u2019s Anadolu news agency said Syrian forces withdrew from several key locations including the civilian airport, closing it as insurgents closed in. Forces spearheaded by HTS also seized an important military base to the south while taking control of Saraqib, a strategic location on the highway to the capital Damascus. Turkish-backed Syrian rebels launched their own operation against Kurdish militants and Syrian government forces in an effort to seize a military airport to the east of Aleppo, as swaths of territory rapidly fell under rebel control. The sweeping offensive appeared to surprise forces loyal to Assad as well as his longtime backers in Moscow and Tehran. In a late-night phone call with the Emirati president, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, Assad stressed that Syria \u201cwill continue to defend its stability and territorial integrity\u201d. He added that Damascus is capable of beating back the advance \u201cwith the help of its allies\u201d. The Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, is expected in Damascus on Sunday before travelling to Turkey, while Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov discussed the situation in Syria with his Turkish counterpart Hakkan Fidan in a phone call. Iran\u2019s Tasnim news agency said the Syrian military continued to battle insurgents in Aleppo, amid reports of both Russian and Syrian airstrikes around the city. The militants appeared to enter Aleppo with ease, in total contrast to the fierce street battles for control of every block that engulfed the ancient urban centre 12 years ago. \u201cNo one expected Aleppo to be taken, which means there were no real defensive lines within the city. Once they got there it seems like it was all open,\u201d said Jerome Drevon of the International Crisis Group. Drevon pointed to the insurgents\u2019 years-long efforts to formalise and hone their forces, allowing them to overwhelm far less organised Syrian government fighters. \u201cI think the regime didn\u2019t expect such a quick move, the operation started just a few days ago,\u201d he said. The Syrian military said the overwhelming number of fighters \u201cand the multiplicity of battlefronts prompted our armed forces to carry out a redeployment operation aimed at strengthening the defence lines in order to absorb the attack, preserve the lives of civilians and soldiers, and prepare for a counterattack.\u201d Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, called the situation in Aleppo \u201can attack on Syrian sovereignty\u201d, adding: \u201cWe are in favour of the Syrian authorities bringing order to the area.\u201d What began in 2011 as a popular uprising calling for Assad\u2019s overthrow later transformed into a bloody civil war, with the battle for control of Aleppo at its heart. Syrian regime forces seized control of the city in 2016, with the aid of Russian air power and Iranian ground forces. As he fought for control of the country, Assad also freed jihadi fighters from the country\u2019s prisons, transforming the uprising against him. The sudden insurgent victory in Aleppo symbolised a dramatic shift in control of key urban centres in Syria, and an unexpected challenge to its president, who had long been seen as having crushed the uprising. Assad\u2019s fractured control of the country had appeared secure enough that his former regional foes, notably Saudi Arabia, had begun to re-establish diplomatic relations with Damascus. Turkish officials, who had also discussed normalising relations with Assad, despite supporting rebel forces, denied any involvement in the Aleppo offensive. \u201cWe will not take any action that could cause a wave of migration,\u201d the foreign minister, Fidan, said amid reports from the UN that fighting had internally displaced 14,000 people in days. The insurgents\u2019 sudden success quickly drew questions about their ability to hold territory, and what an expanded fiefdom led by HTS\u2019s leader known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani could look like. Jolani was designated by the US State Department as a terrorist in 2013 and retains a $10m bounty on his head, but has de facto ruled Idlib province for several years. While the militants in Idlib have attempted to demonstrate their ability to govern, they have also stood accused of crushing dissent while relying heavily on dwindling international aid to meet civilians\u2019 needs. As fighters stormed Aleppo, humanitarians like Sudipta Kumar of Actionaid warned many were suffering in Idlib. \u201cThousands of families now face a freezing winter without anywhere to live,\u201d she said. Sam Heller, an analyst at the Century Foundation, said the insurgents\u2019 ability to hold on to their territorial gains depended on whether Damascus and its allies were able to mount a counter-attack. \u201cCertainly some areas in the Aleppo countryside could be difficult for HTS and their allies to hold on to if they come under really withering air strikes or artillery fire,\u201d he said. Insurgent rule inside Aleppo itself, he added, could prove far more difficult for Assad and his allies to repel in the long term. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear what kind of capabilities Damascus is now able to bring to bear and mobilise from elsewhere in Syria, also critically how much capacity Russia now has in Syria, given its current involvement in Ukraine which has diverted some of their forces to that front.\u201d Drevon doubted that Jolani and his allies would be willing to cede power to a conventional governing authority.
