Ruud van Nistelrooy will continue to take charge of the team until R\u00faben joins.\u201d Amorim is expected to bring five backroom staff with him from Lisbon: the coaches Emanuel Ferro, Ad\u00e9lio C\u00e2ndido and Carlos Fernandes, goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital and sports scientist Paulo Barreira. Amorim confirmed yesterday: \u201cI\u2019m going to take my staff. It was always one of the conditions.\u201d Amorim, who also won two league cups in four full seasons at Sporting, had been on Manchester City\u2019s radar as they plan for Pep Guardiola\u2019s possible departure and a home Champions League game against City on Tuesday is among his final Sporting matches. After the confirmation of his successor\u2019s appointment, Ten Hag released a farewell letter to United supporters last night. \u201cDear fans, let me start by thanking you,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cThank you for always being there for the club. Whether it was at a game far away or a tough match at Old Trafford, your support has been unshakeable. The atmosphere at Old Trafford has always been electrifying, thanks to you. I felt it many times. Also in away games, it gave the team and me an incredible feeling to hear the United chants taking over the opponents\u2019 stadiums.\u201d His letter added: \u201cWe won two trophies \u2013 achievements that I will cherish for the rest of my life. Of course, my dream was to bring more trophies to the cabinet. Unfortunately, that dream has come to an end. I wish all Manchester United fans nothing but success, trophies and glory. \u201cYour support and the warmth I received from everyone at the club helped me feel at home. Thank you for this chapter in my life.\u201d Ten Hag was fired after Sunday\u2019s controversial 2-1 defeat at West Ham, which left United with just three wins and 11 points after nine matches. The interim manager Ruud van Nistelrooy oversaw a 5-2 Carabao Cup win against Leicester on Wednesday and is now preparing to lead the side in Sunday\u2019s league game against Chelsea. The Dutchman, formerly assistant to Ten Hag, will also take charge against Paok in the Europa League and Leicester again in the Premier League before handing the reins to Amorim. Amorim\u2019s appointment was welcomed by the club\u2019s Portuguese defender Diogo Dalot. \u201cHe is a fantastic coach and knows what he wants,\u201d Dalot told Sky Sports. \u201cVery demanding is what I can expect. It\u2019s a perfect match for a club like this. The Premier League suits people from Portugal. We have a culture of constantly trying to improve ourselves as we come from a small country. I really hope that it is one more case. I am really excited to start working with him.\u201d",

Items with a higher price tag like vacuum cleaners are also worth investigating \u2013 from clogged filters to needing a new circuit board \u2013 but Mink is fond of fixing the old relics. \u201cWe had someone who had a Sony Walkman recorder that she had used in her 20s at uni and it had been broken for at least a decade,\u201d says Mink. \u201cShe had a whole bunch of tapes with it from her home town.\u201d Unfortunately toasters are one item that usually can\u2019t be repaired, Mink says, and recommends people take them to a local electrical recycler. \u201cOnce the element is broken it\u2019s done for.\u201d Timber furniture Mink sees people change their habits once they see what\u2019s possible and many come with an eagerness to learn skills themselves. \u201cSomebody once brought in a big oak bed head that had fallen when they were moving,\u201d says Mink. \u201cIt was a minor break, but he couldn\u2019t justify the $500 it would cost to take it to a carpenter. He brought it in and it was great fun.\u201d Chairs and tables don\u2019t take much to fix with the right tools, either by replacing a leg or applying a coat of polish \u2013 one lady came to the repair cafe simply asking for help. \u201cShe was a GP and she just really wanted to learn how to fix this wooden chair,\u201d says Mink. \u201cWe showed her and she did about 80 to 90% of the work. She just needed to be taught.\u201d Odds and ends Volunteer repairers are sometimes apprehensive about unknowns. But the best item Mink has seen was a fairy floss machine that had been in the family for decades and hauled to birthday parties 10 to 15 times a year. The owner had called around to try to find someone who could fix it, but nobody would take a look. \u201cIt was huge \u2013 it weighed 25kg.\u201d \u201cOn the back of it, we found these two little knobs, and a plate came up and there was a whole repair kit inside the fairy floss machine. It had a screws and a grease applicator and everything.\u201d Broken picture frames, clocks and even old camera lenses have also come through the cafe. At Mink\u2019s cafe, photo frames have been pieced back together, replacement clock hands have been found, as well as tinkering with old toys to make them work again as collectibles.Bikes - which often just need the right set of tools to change a tyre and someone with the know-how to tinker with the gears - are also common. But most of all, repairing keeps items off the street and out of landfill. For Norris, places like Fixable hope to encourage more and more people to change their behaviour. \u201cThere\u2019s all this latent knowledge and skills and people who love to do it\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re signing up new people all the time, which is really great, and it just shows this desire or demand in communities for something like this.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Leading construction bodies are urging the government to change its approach to skilled migration and bring in more migrants to ease the shortage of tradies. Industry bodies say a chronic shortage of workers across 12 different trades is impacting housing prices and affecting the flow of new homes into the market. Master Builders, the nation\u2019s peak building and construction industry association, anticipates at least half a million workers must enter the construction industry by 2029 just to keep up with current construction demands. That number does not account for the government target of building 1.2m new homes for the national housing accord, the transition to net zero or any other goals. In March, BuildSkills Australia said 90,000 new tradies were needed between then and the end of 2024. But according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics the industry is falling well short, hiring just over half that number. The huge shortage in workers is the largest contributor to growing construction costs, according to Master Builders, and one of the key reasons the industry has been unable to build enough new homes to meet demand and ease the housing crisis. In an April survey of Master Builders members , 85% said it was a struggle to find suitably qualified workers and 66% said sourcing workers was the biggest issue facing the industry. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Denita Wawn, the CEO of Master Builders Australia, said the industry was \u201cextraordinarily desperate\u201d for more workers, and that migrants were the answer in the immediate term. \u201cLabour shortages are currently the biggest handbrake on new home building and infrastructure projects. If we\u2019re to have any hope of building 1.2m homes we need to get more skilled tradies into the country and quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cSkilled migration is a vital piece of the workforce puzzle in the building and construction industry. In the short term, we cannot address labour shortages through domestic apprenticeships alone.\u201d She said construction costs had blown out by 40% since the pandemic, and attributed a large portion of that increase to labour shortages. Wawn said she was \u201cperplexed\u201d that tradespeople were ignored by the government\u2019s migration strategy, unveiled in 2023. As part of the changes, a \u201cskills in demand\u201d visa was proposed, but the occupation list did not include any trades. That new system splits the pathways into three strands: specialist skills, essential skills and core skills pathways. Because trade workers cannot enter Australia through the specialist skills or essential skills pathways under the proposed system, Master Builders wants the government to add all building and construction trades to the core skills cccupation list. A spokesperson for the home affairs department said the government was currently \u201cconsidering advice from Jobs and Skills Australia on the Core Skills Occupation List and will release its final decision shortly\u201d. They also pointed to more than 11,000 skilled visas granted to workers in the construction industry for the 2023-24 program year under the old temporary skill shortage visa, the highest number in nearly 10 years. But the latest Housing Industry Association (HIA) trades availability index showed the shortage of tradies has been worsening, dropping to -0.54 in the September quarter from -0.49 the previous quarter. Matt King, a senior economist at HIA, said the lack of workers was a major problem. \u201cWhile the severity of shortages varies across Australian markets, all capital city and regional areas are experiencing a consequential shortfall in skilled trades, which is acting as a significant constraint on new home building,\u201d he said. \u201cAustralia does not currently have enough tradies to build the number of homes needed to house the population and take pressure off housing costs. \u201cTrades prices are running at an annual growth rate of 3.4%, which is much higher than the 2.0% average over the decade prior to the pandemic.\u201d He pointed to the \u201cstiff competition\u201d for workers, including \u201cbuoyant\u201d non-residential construction activity and the pipeline of government-funded engineering and construction projects. The index showed bricklaying, tiling, plastering and carpentry were suffering the most acute shortages of skilled tradespeople. HIA and Master Builders are calling for a streamlining of pathways to get more Australians into the industry, but both groups see immigration as an essential short-term fix. Trent Wiltshire, the deputy program director of Grattan Institute\u2019s economic prosperity program, said it was important the government better recognise qualifications from non-English speaking countries. \u201cWe don\u2019t often recognise the qualifications from most countries, and we require people from these countries to jump through more hoops to be able to work here.\u201d He said that mindset \u201creflects the risk appetite\u201d of government. \u201cRecognising overseas qualifications, where we can, is a really key way we can streamline the process and get more construction workers in.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Confrontation on the track has dominated the world championship fight between Max Verstappen and Lando Norris for the previous two races but now closing out what has been a tempestuous and gruelling triple-header, Norris has the opportunity to take advantage in a manner that will make the most impact on the Dutchman without so much as a backward glance. Verstappen will start on the back foot in Brazil with a five-place grid penalty for Sunday\u2019s race after changing his engine, leaving him in a starting position of at best sixth, and potentially even lower if the Red Bull has not closed the gap to Norris, McLaren and the recently resurgent Ferrari who have dominated the last two races. These are places that matter in an increasingly tight fight. Norris trails Verstappen by 47 points with four meetings remaining. This weekend and Qatar next month both include sprint races, taking the points still available to 120. At the last round in Mexico, Norris took 10 points out of Verstappen and with a potential grid advantage the British driver must ideally maximise by taking another big chunk out of the world champion\u2019s lead at the Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace. He now has a good chance to do so by putting clear daylight on him on the track, an important factor given the Dutchman has made clear his position in being uncompromising in how he races. The incidents in Austin and Mexico prompted a vigorous debate and no little criticism that Verstappen was driving dangerously in order to secure any advantage. In Mexico it appeared to pay off, before his time penalties, when Norris was held up behind the Red Bull after Verstappen had illegally passed him, allowing Ferrari\u2019s Carlos Sainz to open a lead from which he could not be caught, costing Norris valuable points. Norris too has been criticised for not being as aggressive as his opponent but he was clear in Brazil, whether it is viewed as weakness or good character, that is not how he wants to go racing. His approach and stance was very pointedly backed by the McLaren team principal, Andrea Stella, on Friday. \u201cLando reflects in the way he goes racing our own values: we race fair, we race in a correct way, we race in a sportsmanlike way,\u201d he said. \u201cLando is coping with being in the fight for the championship in a way that we are enjoying.

In Green Bay, Wisconsin, on Wednesday night, addressing reproductive rights, he attempted to portray himself as a \u201cprotector\u201d of women, despite dozens of claims of sexual assault against him, and a judge\u2019s ruling adjudicating him a rapist. \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to do it, whether the women like it or not.

The lawyers for Musk and his America Pac had argued that the lawsuit, which is seeking to halt the sweepstakes in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, needed to be resolved in federal court as it referenced the 5 November presidential election.

Welcome to Five Great Reads, your Saturday roundup of great writing and insightful analysis this week on the Guardian.</p> <p>Today we have Marina Hyde\u2019s take on Irish actor Saoirse Ronan\u2019s viral chatshow moment, as well as what happens when people with acute psychosis \u201cmeet\u201d the voices in their heads.</p> <p>(And if you\u2019re heading out for Halloween this weekend, this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/oct/28/witch-halloween-sickening-origins-caricature-broomstick\">origin story may change your mind</a> about dressing up as a witch.)</p> <h2>1. \u2018A stone-cold truth\u2019</h2>    <p>The major reason the clip of Saoirse Ronan on The Graham Norton Show affected so many women around the world: because \u201cmost women have found ourselves in that conversation\u201d. Marina Hyde\u2019s column <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/29/chatshow-saoirse-ronan-graham-norton-women\">sums up the exchange brilliantly</a>.</p> <p><strong>What exactly happened on the TV couch? </strong>Three \u201cgood guys of showbiz\u201d \u2013 Denzel Washington, Paul Mescal and Eddie Redmayne \u2013 found \u201cself-defence a hoot\u201d. Meanwhile Ronan, the only woman on the couch, was \u201chonked over\u201d \u2013 before she cut through with what Hyde describes as a line for the ages: \u201cThat\u2019s what girls have to think about all the time.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Best Silence Oscar: </strong>The silence after Ronan\u2019s delivery deserved an Oscar, Hyde says \u2013 as did Ronan\u2019s perfectly timed \u201camirite ladies?\u201d, which was met with roaring applause.</p> <p><strong>How long will it take to read: </strong>three minutes.</p> <h2>2. \u2018It\u2019s a terrible thing for a child to have to think: what\u2019s wrong with me?\u2019</h2>    <p>Simon Hattenstone\u2019s interview with Hollywood action hero Luke Evans is a terrifying, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/26/i-thought-id-die-at-armageddon-hollywood-action-hero-luke-evans-on-growing-up-gay-as-a-jehovahs-witness\">\u201cverging on implausible\u201d, look-back on his turbulent life</a> from a Jehovah\u2019s Witness childhood to the West End, The Hobbit and Fast and Furious. The Welsh actor talks religion, rebelling and why he had to come out twice.</p> <p>It\u2019s a life, Hattenstone writes, that \u201cwould make a fabulous movie\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mention:</strong> Ian McKellen, Evans wrote in his memoir, was one of the first to recognise the glass ceiling he\u2019d broken through as an openly gay action star. \u201cHe was very aware of the ground I was treading,\u201d Evans tells Hattenstone. \u201cI just hoped it would have moved further than it has.\u201d</p> <p><strong>How long will it take to read: </strong>ten and a half minutes.</p> <p><strong>Further reading: </strong>You can <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/film/2024/oct/26/hollywood-actor-luke-evans-i-was-bullied-for-being-gay-before-i-even-understood-what-it-meant\">read an extract</a> from that memoir here.</p> <h2>3. The Rumble in the Jungle</h2>    <p>This week marked the 50th anniversary of Muhammad Ali\u2019s boxing win over George Foreman in Zaire, also known as The Rumble in the Jungle. \u201cNo athletic contest in history has inspired as much global joy\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/28/rumble-in-the-jungle-50th-anniversary-ali-foreman\">Thomas Hauser recollects</a>, thirty-five years after rewatching the fight on tape while sitting beside the winner.</p> <p>***</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t really plan what happened that night \u2026 But when a fighter gets in the ring, he has to adjust to the conditions he faces.\u201d \u2013 Muhammad Ali</p> <p><strong>The other side:</strong> When writing Ali\u2019s biography, Hauser spoke to Foreman, who shared fond memories of their bond \u2013 which centred on religion, but went far beyond it.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I heard [Ali\u2019s] voice, it would always bring me happiness,\u201d Foreman told him. \u201cIt seemed with us there was something greater than religion \u2013 a longing to love and belonging to each other, a thankfulness we had each other.\u201d</p> <p><strong>How long will it take to read: </strong>five minutes.</p> <h2>4. What happens when people with acute psychosis meet the voices in their heads?</h2>    <p>In avatar therapy, a clinician gives voice to their patients\u2019 inner demons. For some of the participants in a new trial, the results have been astounding. For one participant in particular, who had been hearing voices since she was 10, the voices have disappeared entirely. \u201cFor the first time in 40 years, she was alone with her own thoughts. Quiet,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2024/oct/29/acute-psychosis-inner-voices-avatar-therapy-psychiatry\">writes Jenny Kleeman</a>.</p> <p><strong>The diagnosis: </strong>People with schizophrenia or severe depression can experience psychosis, \u201cwhen reality is disrupted by delusions or hallucinations\u201d. But people without mental health conditions can also experience psychosis, triggered by drugs, or social and biological factors.</p> <p><strong>The symptoms: </strong>Kleeman notes that hearing voices is the most common form of psychosis, affecting as many as 70% of people with schizophrenia: \u201cThe voices heard tend to be persecutory and distressing.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The AI therapy: </strong>In the trial, participants created a digital embodiment of the \u201cpersecutor inside their heads\u201d, which a therapist could guide them through a dialogue with. In the process, the hope was, they might \u201cgain control over it\u201d.</p> <p><strong>How long will it take to read: </strong>fifteen minutes.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In the UK and Ireland, <a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org/\">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

      "bodyText": "Good morning! Welcome to Five Great Reads, your Saturday roundup of great writing and insightful analysis this week on the Guardian. Today we have Marina Hyde\u2019s take on Irish actor Saoirse Ronan\u2019s viral chatshow moment, as well as what happens when people with acute psychosis \u201cmeet\u201d the voices in their heads. (And if you\u2019re heading out for Halloween this weekend, this origin story may change your mind about dressing up as a witch.) 1. \u2018A stone-cold truth\u2019 The major reason the clip of Saoirse Ronan on The Graham Norton Show affected so many women around the world: because \u201cmost women have found ourselves in that conversation\u201d. Marina Hyde\u2019s column sums up the exchange brilliantly. What exactly happened on the TV couch? Three \u201cgood guys of showbiz\u201d \u2013 Denzel Washington, Paul Mescal and Eddie Redmayne \u2013 found \u201cself-defence a hoot\u201d. Meanwhile Ronan, the only woman on the couch, was \u201chonked over\u201d \u2013 before she cut through with what Hyde describes as a line for the ages: \u201cThat\u2019s what girls have to think about all the time.\u201d Best Silence Oscar: The silence after Ronan\u2019s delivery deserved an Oscar, Hyde says \u2013 as did Ronan\u2019s perfectly timed \u201camirite ladies?\u201d, which was met with roaring applause. How long will it take to read: three minutes. 2. \u2018It\u2019s a terrible thing for a child to have to think: what\u2019s wrong with me?\u2019 Simon Hattenstone\u2019s interview with Hollywood action hero Luke Evans is a terrifying, \u201cverging on implausible\u201d, look-back on his turbulent life from a Jehovah\u2019s Witness childhood to the West End, The Hobbit and Fast and Furious. The Welsh actor talks religion, rebelling and why he had to come out twice. It\u2019s a life, Hattenstone writes, that \u201cwould make a fabulous movie\u201d. Honourable mention: Ian McKellen, Evans wrote in his memoir, was one of the first to recognise the glass ceiling he\u2019d broken through as an openly gay action star. \u201cHe was very aware of the ground I was treading,\u201d Evans tells Hattenstone. \u201cI just hoped it would have moved further than it has.\u201d How long will it take to read: ten and a half minutes. Further reading: You can read an extract from that memoir here. 3. The Rumble in the Jungle This week marked the 50th anniversary of Muhammad Ali\u2019s boxing win over George Foreman in Zaire, also known as The Rumble in the Jungle. \u201cNo athletic contest in history has inspired as much global joy\u201d, Thomas Hauser recollects, thirty-five years after rewatching the fight on tape while sitting beside the winner. *** \u201cI didn\u2019t really plan what happened that night \u2026 But when a fighter gets in the ring, he has to adjust to the conditions he faces.\u201d \u2013 Muhammad Ali The other side: When writing Ali\u2019s biography, Hauser spoke to Foreman, who shared fond memories of their bond \u2013 which centred on religion, but went far beyond it. \u201cWhen I heard [Ali\u2019s] voice, it would always bring me happiness,\u201d Foreman told him. \u201cIt seemed with us there was something greater than religion \u2013 a longing to love and belonging to each other, a thankfulness we had each other.\u201d How long will it take to read: five minutes. 4. What happens when people with acute psychosis meet the voices in their heads? In avatar therapy, a clinician gives voice to their patients\u2019 inner demons. For some of the participants in a new trial, the results have been astounding. For one participant in particular, who had been hearing voices since she was 10, the voices have disappeared entirely. \u201cFor the first time in 40 years, she was alone with her own thoughts. Quiet,\u201d writes Jenny Kleeman. The diagnosis: People with schizophrenia or severe depression can experience psychosis, \u201cwhen reality is disrupted by delusions or hallucinations\u201d. But people without mental health conditions can also experience psychosis, triggered by drugs, or social and biological factors. The symptoms: Kleeman notes that hearing voices is the most common form of psychosis, affecting as many as 70% of people with schizophrenia: \u201cThe voices heard tend to be persecutory and distressing.\u201d The AI therapy: In the trial, participants created a digital embodiment of the \u201cpersecutor inside their heads\u201d, which a therapist could guide them through a dialogue with. In the process, the hope was, they might \u201cgain control over it\u201d. How long will it take to read: fifteen minutes. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In the US, you can call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on 988, chat on 988lifeline.org, or text HOME to 741741 to connect with a crisis counsellor. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. Other international helplines can be found at befrienders.org 5. An Australian family saga The Blaines were a working-class Queensland family \u2013 they represented everything Michael Shelley hated about Australia. The only problem was, as Walter Marsh explains, Shelley\u2019s children were Blaines. Marsh has spoken to author and journalist Lech Blaine about the stories behind Blaine\u2019slatest book, Australian Gospel: A Family Saga. It\u2019s a tale about growing up in a household that is bound to another \u2013 trying its very best to tear that family apart. A happy outcome: Blaine\u2019s newfound connection with his three siblings, who he called every few nights while writing the book. \u201cThat went on for years,\u201d he tells Marsh. \u201cI think it just created a real intimacy.\u201d How long will it take to read: three and a half minutes.

Then said: \u201cLet\u2019s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. Let\u2019s see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face.\u201d Early on Friday, Cheney issued a stinging response on X. \u201cThis is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant. #Womenwillnotbesilenced #VoteKamala,\u201d she posted. Trump made his comments on Thursday about Cheney after complaining that Democratic criticism of his campaign had fueled what according to authorities were two failed assassination attempts against him. Mayes told Arizona\u2019s 12News it was not yet clear whether Trump\u2019s comment amounted to protected free speech or a criminal threat. \u201cThat\u2019s the question, whether it did cross the line. It\u2019s deeply troubling,\u201d Mayes said, according to Reuters. \u201cIt is the kind of thing that riles people up and that makes our situation in Arizona and other states more dangerous.\u201d Cheney has said she has never voted for a Democrat before but will do so \u201cproudly\u201d for Harris in this election to ensure Trump never holds a position of public trust again. Her father will join her in casting his ballot for Harris.",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a recap of the main developments: The situation in the northern Gaza Strip is \u201capocalyptic\u201d as Israel pursues a military offensive against Hamas militants in the area, top UN officials warned on Friday. \u201cThe entire Palestinian population in north Gaza is at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine and violence,\u201d they said, adding that humanitarian efforts could not keep up with the scale of the needs in northern Gaza, due to constraints on access for aid workers. About 60 people have been killed and dozens injured overnight and into Friday morning in Israeli strikes on the city of Deir al-Balah, the Nuseirat camp and the town of al-Zawayda, all in central Gaza, as well as in the south, according to medics. At least 43,259 people have been killed in the year-long war in Gaza, according to the territory\u2019s health ministry on Friday, including 55 deaths in the last 24 hours. The death toll from an Israeli raid in the north of the occupied West Bank has risen to four, according to Palestinian health officials. The Ramallah-based health ministry said two people were killed by gunfire and two by bombing in the two-day military raid, which ended yesterday. The operation in the Nur Shams refugee camp heavily damaged the offices of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa. The Israeli military said on Friday it killed senior Hamas official Izz al-Din Kassab in an airstrike in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. Hamas mourned his death, but said he was not a member of its decision-making political office. At least 2,897 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Lebanon since last October, according to the latest figures from Lebanon\u2019s health ministry on Friday. The toll includes 30 people killed on Friday. A further 13,150 people have been injured in Lebanon. Israel\u2019s air force continued to bombard Beirut\u2019s southern suburb of Dahiyeh overnight, destroying dozens of buildings in several neighbourhoods, Lebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency said on Friday. Israel has recently intensified its airstrikes on the north-eastern city of Baalbek and nearby villages, and parts of southern Lebanon. The US asked Lebanon to declare a unilateral ceasefire to revive stalled talks to end hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, according to a report later denied by the Lebanese prime minister, Najib Mikati. Reports said the US envoy, Amos Hochstein, had communicated the proposal to Mikati this week. Mikati\u2019s office said his government\u2019s stance was clear on seeking a ceasefire from both sides and implementation of UN security council resolution 1701, which ended the last round of conflict between Israel and Lebanon in 2006. A Hamas official said it received a proposal for a short-term truce in Gaza and rejected it for not including a lasting ceasefire. \u201cThe proposals do not include a permanent cessation of aggression, nor do they entail the withdrawal of the Israeli army from the Gaza Strip or the return of displaced persons,\u201d the official, a member of Hamas\u2019s political bureau, told AFP. The World Health Organization said on Friday that a second round of child polio vaccinations in northern Gaza would begin on Saturday, after Israeli bombing in the area halted the drive. Separately, the WHO said it is deeply concerned about rising attacks on health care workers and facilities in Lebanon. A former Israeli intelligence official told CNN there is a \u201chigh possibility\u201d that militia groups in Iraq will be used by Iran to carry out a potential retaliatory strike against Israel. It comes after an Axios report that claimed Israeli intelligence suggested Iran is preparing to attack Israel from Iraqi territory in the coming days, possibly before the US presidential election on 5 November. Kamal Kharrazi, an adviser to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, said Tehran is likely to increase the range of its ballistic missile. Kharrazi also indicated that Iran\u2019s nuclear doctrine could change if the nation faced an existential threat. Kharrazi said that Iran has the capability to make a nuclear weapon, but a \u201cfatwa\u201d (ruling) by supreme leader Ali Khamenei currently prohibits it. The UN\u2019s secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has said that the killing of journalists in Gaza, which has taken place at levels that are unprecedented in any conflict, was \u201cunacceptable\u201d. \u201cThe voices of journalists must be protected and press freedom must be safeguarded,\u201d he said on the sidelines of a UN seminar in Geneva, Al Jazeera reported. In a statement to mark International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists on Saturday, Guterres said: Recent years have seen an alarming rate of fatalities in conflict zones \u2013 in particular in Gaza, which has seen the highest number of killings of journalists and media workers in any war in decades. Hamas has confirmed the death of senior official Izz al-Din Kassab, after the Israeli military said it had killed him in an airstrike in Khan Younis. The group mourned the death of Kassab in a statement on Friday, adding that he was killed along with another Hamas official, Ayman Ayesh, in an Israeli attack on their car in Gaza. Hamas sources told Reuters that Kassab was a local group official in Gaza but not a member of its decision-making political office. A former Israeli intelligence official said there is a \u201chigh possibility\u201d that militia groups in Iraq will be used by Iran to carry out a potential retaliatory strike against Israel. Miri Eisen, a fellow at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism, told CNN on Friday: This would be a way for Iran to retaliate without being held directly responsible, at least in their thinking. It comes after an Axios report that claimed Israeli intelligence suggested Iran is preparing to attack Israel from Iraqi territory in the coming days. The Israeli military is \u201cstill assessing the decision-making process in Iran\u201d to determine if and when a retaliation will take place,\u201d an Israeli military source told CNN. It\u2019s approaching 8pm in Tel Aviv, Gaza and Beirut. Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments: Israeli airstrikes on Friday killed at least 30 people in northeastern Lebanon, said the country\u2019s news agency, bringing the total toll to 2,897 since Israel started its recent offensive against Hezbollah. The death toll from strikes in the central Gaza Strip rose to 25, including five children, as more bodies were recovered. The Israeli military told AP that it had hit a Hamas infrastructure site and a militant who was operating in the area of Nuseirat, but did not comment on the other strikes. Many of the Palestinians were killed in an Israeli strike on the entrance of a school sheltering displaced people in the Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip. The Israeli military said it was aware of reports of civilian casualties and was investigating. The unfolding situation in the northern Gaza Strip is \u201capocalyptic\u201d, United Nations chiefs said on Friday, with a warning that its entire population was at \u201cimminent risk\u201d of death. \u201cThe situation unfolding in North Gaza is apocalyptic,\u201d said the joint statement from heads of organisations that form the UN Inter-Agency Standing Committee. \u201cThe area has been under siege for almost a month, denied basic aid and life-saving supplies while bombardment and other attacks continue. Just in the past few days, hundreds of Palestinians have been killed, most of them women and children, and thousands have once again been forcibly displaced \u2026 The entire Palestinian population in North Gaza is at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine and violence.\u201d Kamal Kharrazi, an adviser to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, has told pro-Iran broadcaster Al-Mayadeen that Tehran is likely to increase the range of its ballistic missiles, according to Reuters reports. The United Nations have called the unfolding situation in the northern Gaza Strip \u201capocalyptic\u201d, and warned that its entire population was at \u201cimminent risk\u201d of death. They said the entire Middle East region was now on a precipice and called for an immediate cessation of hostilities. Hamas rejected a short-term truce proposal from mediators Egypt and Qatar, for not including a lasting ceasefire. A spokesperson said the group had responded by restating its position that \u201cwhat the Palestinian people want is a complete, comprehensive and lasting ceasefire\u201d. The Israeli military said it had killed senior Hamas official Izz al-Din Kassab in an airstrike in Khan Younis. The Israeli military said on Friday it killed senior Hamas official Izz al-Din Kassab, describing him as one of the last high-ranking members of Hamas responsible for coordinating with other groups in Gaza, in an airstrike in Khan Younis. An update from the Lebanese Health Ministry said the death toll from Israeli attacks on Friday has risen to 30, bringing the total toll to 2,897. A further 13,150 people have been injured in Lebanon. The unfolding situation in the northern Gaza Strip is \u201capocalyptic\u201d, United Nations chiefs said Friday, warning that its entire population was at \u201cimminent risk\u201d of death. They said the entire Middle East region was now on a precipice and called for an immediate cessation of hostilities. \u201cThe situation unfolding in North Gaza is apocalyptic,\u201d said the joint statement from heads of organisations that form the UN Inter-Agency Standing Committee. \u201cThe area has been under siege for almost a month, denied basic aid and life-saving supplies while bombardment and other attacks continue. Just in the past few days, hundreds of Palestinians have been killed, most of them women and children, and thousands have once again been forcibly displaced. \u201cThe entire Palestinian population in North Gaza is at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine and violence.\u201d They urged all parties fighting in the besieged Palestinian territory to protect civilians, and called on Israel \u201cto cease its assault on Gaza and on the humanitarians trying to help\u201d. \u201cHumanitarian aid cannot keep up with the scale of the needs due to the access constraints. Basic, life-saving goods are not available. Humanitarians are not safe to do their work and are blocked by Israeli forces and by insecurity from reaching people in need,\u201d they said. \u201cHumanitarian relief must be facilitated, and we urge all parties to provide unimpeded access to affected people,\u201d while hospitals \u201cshould not turn into battlegrounds\u201d. The statement was signed by the heads of the UN humanitarian, health, food, rights, migration, refugee, development, children and women\u2019s agencies, among others. \u201cThe entire region is on the edge of a precipice. An immediate cessation of hostilities and a sustained, unconditional ceasefire are long overdue,\u201d they said. A Hamas official said Friday the group received a proposal from mediators Egypt and Qatar for a short-term truce in Gaza and rejected it for not including a lasting ceasefire, AFP reports. \u201cThe proposals do not include a permanent cessation of aggression, nor do they entail the withdrawal of the Israeli army from the Gaza Strip or the return of displaced persons,\u201d the official, a member of Hamas\u2019s political bureau, told AFP on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak publicly on the issue. A senior Hamas leader, Taher al-Nunu, had already warned on Thursday that the group would reject any proposal for a temporary halt to the fighting. But Nunu had said the group had not received any formal proposal at the time. The Hamas official who spoke to AFP on Friday said the temporary ceasefire proposal had included an increase in the number of aid trucks as well as a partial exchange of prisoners. He said the group had responded by restating its position that \u201cwhat the Palestinian people want is a complete, comprehensive and lasting ceasefire\u201d. Israeli airstrikes on Friday killed at least 24 people in northeastern Lebanon, the country\u2019s news agency said, raising the death toll from earlier estimates. Israel\u2019s military has said that its operation in Lebanon is targeting Hezbollah\u2019s military infrastructure. Lebanon\u2019s state National news agency reported four airstrikes in different villages across country\u2019s northeast, saying rescuers were still searching for survivors in Younine, a town in the Bekaa valley, from the rubble of a targeted house. Kamal Kharrazi, an adviser to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, told pro-Iran broadcaster Al-Mayadeen that Tehran is likely to increase the range of its ballistic missiles, Reuters reports. Kharrazi also indicated that Iran\u2019s nuclear doctrine could change if the nation faced an existential threat. Kharrazi said that Iran has the capability to make a nuclear weapon, but a \u201cfatwa\u201d (ruling) by supreme leader Ali Khamenei currently prohibits it. Israel launched retaliatory strikes on sites in Iran last weekend in a widely anticipated response to an Iranian ballistic missile salvo on Tel Aviv and military bases on 1 October. AFP reports another strike has hit the city of Tyre in Lebanon. the strike levelled a building on the city\u2019s seafront, where rescuers and paramedics were seen pulling people from under the rubble, an AFP correspondent said. Unverified videos posted on social media appear to show a large plume of smoke billowing over the city. We will update you when we find out more. Palestinian health officials say the death toll from an Israeli raid in the north of the occupied West Bank has risen from three to four, AP reports. The Ramallah-based health ministry said two people were killed by gunfire and two by bombing in the two-day military raid, which ended yesterday. The Israeli military said its troops withdrew from the camp after striking two militants who had fired upon soldiers and killed other militants in \u201cclose quarters combat.\u201d Hamas denounced the attack, which it said killed a Hamas leader in the area. The operation in the Nur Shams refugee camp heavily damaged the offices of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. The agency\u2019s Commissioner General, Philippe Lazzarini, wrote Thursday on X that it had been put out of service by Israeli military bulldozers that partially demolished the building. The Israeli military denied it damaged the building. It said militants had planted explosives nearby and set them off to attack Israeli troops and that the blast \u201clikely caused damage to the building.\u201d Here are some of the latest images from Israel, Lebanon and Gaza coming from the wires \u2026 Houthi supporters chanted slogans and held up rifles at a rally in Sana\u2019a, Yemen. Yemenis gathered for a rally today in solidarity with the Lebanese and Palestinian people amid Israel\u2019s military operations in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip. Yemen\u2019s Houthis have launched missile and drone attacks against 202 vessels in the seas around the country since November 2023 in retaliation for Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza and Lebanon, the Houthis\u2019 leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi said in a televised speech on 31 October. Israel is ramping up defence spending as its cabinet passed the budget for 2025, AP reports. The budget, which must still be approved by Israel\u2019s parliament before taking effect, increases defence spending to at least $27.2bn (\u00a321bn), Israeli media reported, though that could increase to $40 billion pending further cabinet discussions. In the last year, Israel spent $27.5 billion on defence, according to the the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The budget has been mired in controversy in Israel, with the destruction caused by conflicts on two fronts driving up government expenditures and debt, a mass call-up of reservist soldiers hurting families and small businesses, and international credit ratings being downgraded. Economists have called for an end to the war with Hamas in Gaza and for far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich to construct a budget that reduces the country\u2019s deficit \u2014 something that would require unpopular decisions such as raising taxes or cutting spending. Opposition politicians criticised the budget for allocating funds to government ministries \u2014 run by Netanyahu\u2019s far-right and ultranationalist coalition partners \u2014 which they described at superfluous. Yair Lapid, leader of the opposition in Israel, wrote on X that the budget \u201cdistributes billions of shekels to 10 unnecessary government ministries. They\u2019ve lost their shame.\u201d AP has provided updated death tolls for the Israeli strikes on Gaza and Lebanon overnight and today. The death toll from strikes in the central Gaza Strip rose to 25, including five children, as more bodies were recovered, while officials said that 13 people were killed in airstrikes in Lebanon on Friday. Sixteen people had initially been reported killed in two strikes on Thursday on the Gaza Strip\u2019s central Nuseirat refugee camp, but officials from the Al-Aqsa hospital said bodies continued to be brought in. Overall, the hospital said they had received 21 dead from the strikes, including some transferred from the Awda hospital, where they had been brought the day before. One of the strikes killed an 18-month-old and his 10-year-old sister \u2014 the children\u2019s mother was missing as of today, while the father was killed by an Israeli airstrike four months ago, the family told an AP journalist at Al-Aqsa hospital. Strikes on a motorcycle in Zuwaida and on a house in Deir al-Balah today killed four more people, hospital officials said, bringing the overall toll to 25. The Israeli military told AP that it had hit a Hamas infrastructure site and a militant who was operating in the area of Nuseirat, but did not comment on the other strikes. It said it was aware of reports of civilian casualties and was investigating. The World Health Organization said on Friday that a second round of child polio vaccinations in northern Gaza would begin on Saturday, after Israeli bombing in the area halted the drive. \u201cPolio vaccination in northern Gaza is ready to resume tomorrow,\u201d WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X, adding: \u201cWe are assured of the necessary humanitarian pause in Gaza City to conduct the campaign.\u201d \u201c@WHO and @Unicef urge for the humanitarian pauses to be respected. However, what the children in northern Gaza and across the whole Strip really need is peace.\u201d Israeli commentator and analyst Akiva Eldar has told Al Jazeera that there are no signs that Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is either ready or willing to reach a ceasefire deal with Lebanon before the US election next Tuesday. \u201cHe is praying and putting his bets on the victory of former president Trump, and he believes that once this happens, he will be able to manipulate the president,\u201d Eldar told Al Jazeera from Tel Aviv. \u201cThere is another deadline for Netanyahu, and this is [in] the first week of December when he will have to start testifying in his corruption trial, and he will do anything to avoid it,\u201d Eldar added. The UN\u2019s special coordinator for Lebanon said the country\u2019s cultural heritage was being endangered by Israeli strikes on the ancient Lebanese cities of Tyre and Baalbek, home to Unesco-designated Roman ruins, according to AFP. \u201cAncient Phoenician cities steeped in history are in deep peril of being left in ruins,\u201d Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert said in a social media post, adding that \u201cLebanon\u2019s cultural heritage must not become yet another casualty in this devastating conflict\u201d. At least 10 Palestinians have been killed in an Israeli strike targeting the entrance of a school sheltering displaced people in the Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip, Reuters reports, citing medics on the ground. The UN humanitarian aid coordination agency is pointing to a new \u201cwave of displacement\u201d in Lebanon after the Israeli army issued new orders for people to leave areas it is targeting, AP reports. Spokesperson Jens Laerke of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Aid, citing local officials, said new displacement orders for Beiruts southern suburbs were followed shortly afterward by heavy airstrikes. He told reporters in Geneva that other recent displacement orders from the Israeli military spurred an estimated 50,000 people to leave the eastern city of Baalbek and head mostly toward the northern Bekaa Valley. \u201cWe are working to access civilians who remain in hard to reach areas. To date, 15 convoys have successfully been organised to reach areas\u201d in four Lebanese cities, including Baalbek, Laerke said. \u201cBut the insecurity has an impact on what we can do.\u201d The office of Lebanese caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati denied an earlier report by Reuters that the US had asked Lebanon to declare a unilateral ceasefire, after two sources told Reuters that a US envoy had made the request to inject momentum into stalled talks on a deal to end hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel. In a statement to Reuters, Mikati\u2019s office said the government\u2019s stance was clear on seeking a ceasefire from both sides and the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the last round of conflict between the two foes in 2006. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza reports that at least 43,259 people have been killed in the year-long war between Israel and Palestinian militants. The toll includes 55 deaths in the previous 24 hours, according to the ministry. Lebanon state news agency reports that another Israeli strike has hit the city of Baalbek. The National News Agency said Israeli \u201cenemy aircraft launched a raid on the Zahraa neighbourhood in the city of Baalbek,\u201d home to ancient Roman ruins designated a Unesco World Heritage site. Israel put the city under an evacuation order yesterday \u2013 causing a mass exodus of people \u2013 as it carried out strikes in the region. The World Health Organisation is deeply concerned about rising attacks on health care workers and facilities in Lebanon, a WHO official said. Margaret Harris said at a UN briefing that while 55 attacks on health care workers have been verified, the actual number of incidents is likely to be significantly higher. AFP reports on the destruction of homes in border towns in Lebanon by Israel. According to Lebanon\u2019s official National News Agency, Israeli troops dynamited buildings in at least seven border villages in Lebanon last month, AFP reports. Earlier this week Israel\u2019s Channel 12 broadcast footage appearing to show one of its presenters blow up a building while embedded with soldiers in the village of Aita al-Shaab. On 26 October, the NNA said Israel \u201cblew up and destroyed houses... in the village of Odaisseh\u201d. That day, Israel\u2019s military said 400 tonnes of explosives detonated in a Hezbollah tunnel, which it said was about a mile long. Lebanon\u2019s National Human Rights Commission has said \u201cthe ongoing destruction campaign carried out by the Israeli army in southern Lebanon is a war crime\u201d. Israel\u2019s military used \u201cair strikes, bulldozers, and manually controlled explosions\u201d to level entire neighbourhoods - homes, schools, mosques, churches, shrines, and archaeological sites, the commission said. The tweet below shows the Channel 12 segment where one of its journalists participated in the demolition of homes in Lebanon. A US envoy this week asked Lebanon to declare a unilateral ceasefire with Israel as part of an effort to help negotiations to reach a resolution for the more than year-long conflict, a senior Lebanese political source and a senior diplomat said, Reuters reports. The sources said the effort was communicated by US Lebanon envoy Amos Hochstein to Lebanese caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati. But such an announcement was seen as a non-starter in Lebanon, the sources said, where it would likely be equated with a surrender. Mikati said Israel\u2019s expanded strikes on Lebanon last night indicated a rejection of efforts to broker a truce. The Israel Defence Force has shared pictures of Nazi memorabilia it says it found in \u201ccivilian homes exploited by Hezbollah\u201d in Lebanon. The IDF shared photos of a book with a swastika and the name \u201cHassan Salih\u201d inscribed on the front, as well as a Nazi pennant flag and figurine of Adolf Hitler, but it did not provide any more evidence or details of the find. The Guardian could not independently verify the images. Thailand\u2019s labor minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn said he had ordered the evacuation of all Thai workers from the north of Israel to the south, after four Thais were killed by rocket fire while working on farms near Israel\u2019s border with Lebanon. Maris Sangiampongsa, Thailand\u2019s foreign minister, confirmed the deaths of four workers, and said another had been injured close to the town of Metula near the Israeli-Lebanese border. Three Israelis were also killed in what was the deadliest cross-border strikes from Lebanon since Israel launched its ground invasion. The deaths, which follow the killing of another Thai worker in a mortar strike in October near the border with Lebanon, have prompted questions over why workers are being deployed to areas so close to the conflict. The Hotline for Refugees and Migrants, an Israeli organisation that supports migrant workers, said authorities had put them in danger by allowing them to work along the border without proper protection. Thai workers have been among the foreign nationals worst affected by the conflict. Before the war, about 30,000 Thai nationals were working in Israel, mostly in agricultural jobs, where the salaries offered are much higher than back home. Many were killed or taken hostage during the Hamas attacks on 7 October. So far 23 Thai hostages have been released, while a further six remain in Gaza. Maris, Thailand\u2019s foreign minister, said he had instructed the Thai embassy in Tel Aviv \u201cto extend every and all assistance to the injured and families of the deceased\u201d. \u201cThailand continues to strongly urge all parties to return to the path of peace, in the name of the innocent civilians gravely impacted by this prolonged and deepening conflict\u201d, he said. Lebanon\u2019s prime minister Najib Mikati criticised Israel\u2019s \u201cexpansion\u201d of its attacks on his country, saying they indicated a rejection of efforts to broker a truce after more than a month of war, AFP reports. \u201cThe Israeli enemy\u2019s renewed expansion of the scope of its aggression on Lebanese regions, its repeated threats to the population to evacuate entire cities and villages, and its renewed targeting of the southern suburbs of Beirut with destructive raids, are all indicators that confirm the Israeli enemy\u2019s rejection of all efforts being made to secure a ceasefire,\u201d Mikati said in a statement after overnight raids hit Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, in the first such attack this week. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry says an Israeli airstrike on a mountain town overlooking Beirut has killed three people and wounded five, AP reports. The ministry gave no further details about the airstrike on the edge of Qamatiyeh, southeast of Beirut. An AP journalist who visited the scene said the strike was closer to the nearby village of Ein al-Rummaneh, adding that it caused minor damage to an apartment on the first floor of a building. A Reuters report looks at the worsening conditions in Lebanon as looming winter stretches the country\u2019s ability to aid those displaced by Israel\u2019s attacks: Thousands are seeking refuge from Israeli strikes in the mountainous Christian town of Deir al-Ahmar in eastern Lebanon. The town was already hosting more than 10,000 displaced people before Israel escalated its strikes on predominantly Shi\u2019ite Muslim Baalbek and nearby towns starting on Wednesday this week. \u201cIf we flee the bombing, are we meant to die of cold?\u201d said Suzanne Qassem, a mother of two at one displacement centre, whose home in Buday had been destroyed. \u201cI\u2019m sick, I\u2019ve been taking medicine for a week and I\u2019m still coughing... If my son gets sick, am I going to be able to get him medicine?\u201d Temperatures in Deir al-Ahmar are dropping to 6C overnight even before winter fully sets in and the schools have no diesel to run central heating systems. \u201cAt night, we\u2019re shaking. I put my mattress up next to my daughter and tell her to hug me so that we can keep warm. But we\u2019re not keeping warm,\u201d said Neyfe Mazloum, 69. More than 1.2 million people have been displaced by Israeli strikes on Lebanon over the last year in its campaign against militant group Hezbollah. That includes nearly 190,000 who have sought refuge in shelters. Others are staying with relatives, have rented out homes, or are sleeping in the streets. Lebanon\u2019s crisis management agency says that out of 1,130 accredited shelters, 948 have reached maximum capacity. Most of the displaced are in the districts of Mount Lebanon and Beirut \u2013 easy to reach for most aid organisations \u2013 but Deir al-Ahmar is much further afield. Local volunteers are worried that the looming winter will cut off the only safe route into Deir al-Ahmar, leaving them stranded. \u201cThat road will close with the first snow. It will be like a siege,\u201d said Khodr Zeaiter, an aid volunteer. More images show the level of destruction in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza following Israeli airstrikes overnight. The first images of the overnight attacks on Lebanon are emerging on the wires \u2026 Forty seven Palestinians were killed and dozens injured, most of them children and women, in overnight Israeli bombardment of the city of Deir Al-Balah, the Nuseirat camp and the town of Al-Zawayda in the central Gaza Strip, the Palestinian news agency WAFA said, Reuters reports. The Israeli military said its troops had identified and eliminated \u201cseveral armed terrorists\u201d in central Gaza and had eliminated \u201cdozens of terrorists\u201d in targeted raids in northern Gaza\u2019s Jabalia area. Israel\u2019s air force pounded Beirut\u2019s southern suburb of Dahiyeh overnight, destroying dozens of buildings in several neighborhoods, Lebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency said Friday, AP reports. The strikes on Dahiyeh \u2014 after a four-day lull during which no airstrikes were reported in the suburb \u2014 destroyed dozens of buildings and caused fires in the area. There was no immediate word on casualties. Recently, Israel has intensified its airstrikes on the northeastern city of Baalbek and nearby villages, as well as different parts of southern Lebanon. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s continuing coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly told US envoys that Israel\u2019s ability to counter threats to its security from Lebanon and return displaced people to the north were key elements of any ceasefire deal. The comments came hours before Israel carried out airstrikes early on Friday on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, Reuters witnesses said, the first strikes there in nearly a week. \u201cThe main issue is \u2026 Israel\u2019s ability and determination to enforce the agreement and thwart any threat to its security from Lebanon,\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s office cited him as telling two US envoys. The envoys, Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein, were in Israel on a new push to secure ceasefires in both Lebanon and Gaza. Lebanon\u2019s prime minister on Wednesday expressed hope that a ceasefire deal was imminent. Hochstein and McGurk, met the Israeli prime minister on Thursday to talk about a ceasefire proposal for Lebanon. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said negotiators made \u201cgood progress\u201d toward a deal. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that we will see things transition in Lebanon in a not too distant future,\u201d US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said. Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, who had expressed optimism of a speedy settlement \u201cin hours or days\u201d earlier on Thursday, said that Israel\u2019s \u201congoing escalation\u201d in his country \u201cdoes not inspire optimism\u201d. Netanyahu\u2019s office said the prime minister \u201cmade it clear that the main point is not this or that agreement on paper but Israel\u2019s ability and determination to enforce the agreement and thwart any threat to its security from Lebanon, in a manner that will return our residents securely to their homes\u201d. Thursday marked a day when the most civilians in both Israel and Lebanon were killed since October 2023. The Lebanese health ministry said that Israeli attacks had killed 45 people in the previous 24 hours, amid bombing in the north-east Bekaa valley and infantry battles in the south. In one Bekaa village, eight people were killed from the same family. In northern Israel, seven people were killed by rocket fire from Lebanon, including four Thai agricultural workers. The Israeli army\u2019s evacuation call for several areas of south Lebanon on Thursday included a Palestinian refugee camp. Among the areas listed was Rashidieh camp, which houses thousands of Palestinian refugees. Israel issued its second evacuation order for the city of Baalbek and two surrounding villages in the Bekaa valley on Thursday afternoon, carrying out a series of airstrikes on the village of Durous a few hours later. The evacuation orders had prompted a mass exodus of residents from the city, which is home to a Unesco world heritage site. Israeli attacks killed at least one child in Lebanon each day and injured 10 others, the UN children\u2019s agency (Unicef) said. Citing the Lebanese health ministry, Unicef said 166 children have been killed since October 2023, while at least 1,168 have been injured. It awrned that the war in Lebanon is \u201cinflicting severe physical wounds and deep emotional scars\u201d on many of the country\u2019s children. Six Lebanese health workers were killed and four wounded in Israeli strikes across south Lebanon on Thursday, the health ministry said in a statement.",

      "body": "<p>Live, die, repeat. There is a familiar feeling of pathos in watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/01/manchester-united-confirm-ruben-amorim-manager-sporting-november\">the latest Manchester United manager</a> loom into view, carpetbag in hand, squaring those fragile shoulders, another face, another four-year plan, all these brave hopeful souls, like men in hats and coats heading off to Flanders.</p> <p>It should be said United have been impressively efficient in reaching this point. Unsticking a premium European manager from a Champions League club in mid-season is no simple task. The announcement of Ruben Amorim as head-coach-in-waiting comes four days on from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/28/manchester-united-sack-erik-ten-hag\">sacking of Erik ten Hag</a>. After the Weekend at Bernie\u2019s absurdity of Ten Hag\u2019s new contract, after the four-month zombie-stumble into the current season that has made Amorim\u2019s own task so much harder, this has at least been surgical and decisive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/01/ruben-amorim-manchester-united-manager-in-tray-style-midfield\">Create a style and sort midfield: R\u00faben Amorim\u2019s in-tray at Manchester United</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At which point it is tempting to see the start of another whodunnit. We know this story by now. We know it ends with a body. We know the optics, the chalk lines, the world-weary forensics team, the detective inspector in the rumpled overcoat. The key point of interest at this early stage is always the same. Exactly how, in what highly personalised way, are Manchester United going to do for this poor soul?</p> <p>The pattern in the post-Ferguson era has been to tease out one particular quality, to reduce the incumbent to an exaggerated cartoon. It took four months for David Moyes to be recast as a boggle-eyed impostor, the salesman with an empty suitcase. By the end of his own time Ten Hag looked like a quietly doomed knight-errant, out there still stubbornly riding his horse backwards into battle. Louis van Gaal: amusingly insane Dutch robot. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: toxic super-villain. Ralf Rangnick: unhappy driving instructor. This place is an enchanted island. It will stretch you thin, twist you out of shape.</p> <p>The difference this time is the club has actually done something new. Against all odds, bravely hurling the rulebook out of the window, Manchester United have appointed the right person. This is a novel concept all round. It is also a genuine test of the institution. It has been easy to grow resigned to the structural problems at this sclerotic super-club, the feeling as managers come and go of watching someone constantly changing the steering wheel cover on a car with a snapped timing belt.</p>    <p>But results, efficiency and good choices also have a tangible effect. Too many of those who came before were clearly out of their depth, symptoms of wider executive incompetence rather than a challenge to it. Well, here we have, if not the coming man of European football, then a coming man. We have a ruthlessness and self-possession, plus a new administration who have so far talked a good game without actually playing one. The ingredients are actually in place for something different. How\u2019s this going to work out then?</p> <p>Listing the potential pros and cons is fairly easy at this stage. All the good stuff is Amorim. All the bad stuff is Manchester United. The manager\u2019s basic CV is hugely impressive. Domestic trophies, a compellingly intense Champions League presence, a Sporting team still on the rise four years in.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>R\u00faben Amorim looks like the handsome, successful man in an advert for caffeine-powered shampoo</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The optics are also compelling, and optics matter here. Amorim looks great. Beard, hair, jawline, tailoring. The eyes? The eyes are piercing. He looks like the handsome, successful man in an advert for caffeine-powered shampoo.</p> <p>We already hear constant references to his Porsche, his personal charm, the energy of his press conferences. This shouldn\u2019t matter, but it does. We\u2019re dealing with magic, voodoo, haunted houses, extreme qualities of perseverance and resilience. Anybody walking through those doors needs to come tooled up with a pretty robust sense of self.</p> <p>There has already been a vast amount of tactical analysis of Amorim\u2019s teams and of his imaginary teams of the future. He likes to play three central defenders. In an ideal world <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jul/31/manchester-united-leny-yoro-injury\">Lenny Yoro</a>, Matthijs de Ligt and Lisandro Mart\u00ednez could be in line to form a theoretical dream backline, which does presuppose all three are going to be fit and in form at the same time. R\u00faben? Meet Jonny Evans.

      "bodyText": "Live, die, repeat. There is a familiar feeling of pathos in watching the latest Manchester United manager loom into view, carpetbag in hand, squaring those fragile shoulders, another face, another four-year plan, all these brave hopeful souls, like men in hats and coats heading off to Flanders. It should be said United have been impressively efficient in reaching this point. Unsticking a premium European manager from a Champions League club in mid-season is no simple task. The announcement of Ruben Amorim as head-coach-in-waiting comes four days on from the sacking of Erik ten Hag. After the Weekend at Bernie\u2019s absurdity of Ten Hag\u2019s new contract, after the four-month zombie-stumble into the current season that has made Amorim\u2019s own task so much harder, this has at least been surgical and decisive. At which point it is tempting to see the start of another whodunnit. We know this story by now. We know it ends with a body. We know the optics, the chalk lines, the world-weary forensics team, the detective inspector in the rumpled overcoat. The key point of interest at this early stage is always the same. Exactly how, in what highly personalised way, are Manchester United going to do for this poor soul? The pattern in the post-Ferguson era has been to tease out one particular quality, to reduce the incumbent to an exaggerated cartoon. It took four months for David Moyes to be recast as a boggle-eyed impostor, the salesman with an empty suitcase. By the end of his own time Ten Hag looked like a quietly doomed knight-errant, out there still stubbornly riding his horse backwards into battle. Louis van Gaal: amusingly insane Dutch robot. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: toxic super-villain. Ralf Rangnick: unhappy driving instructor. This place is an enchanted island. It will stretch you thin, twist you out of shape. The difference this time is the club has actually done something new. Against all odds, bravely hurling the rulebook out of the window, Manchester United have appointed the right person. This is a novel concept all round. It is also a genuine test of the institution. It has been easy to grow resigned to the structural problems at this sclerotic super-club, the feeling as managers come and go of watching someone constantly changing the steering wheel cover on a car with a snapped timing belt. But results, efficiency and good choices also have a tangible effect. Too many of those who came before were clearly out of their depth, symptoms of wider executive incompetence rather than a challenge to it. Well, here we have, if not the coming man of European football, then a coming man. We have a ruthlessness and self-possession, plus a new administration who have so far talked a good game without actually playing one. The ingredients are actually in place for something different. How\u2019s this going to work out then? Listing the potential pros and cons is fairly easy at this stage. All the good stuff is Amorim. All the bad stuff is Manchester United. The manager\u2019s basic CV is hugely impressive. Domestic trophies, a compellingly intense Champions League presence, a Sporting team still on the rise four years in. The optics are also compelling, and optics matter here. Amorim looks great. Beard, hair, jawline, tailoring. The eyes? The eyes are piercing. He looks like the handsome, successful man in an advert for caffeine-powered shampoo. We already hear constant references to his Porsche, his personal charm, the energy of his press conferences. This shouldn\u2019t matter, but it does. We\u2019re dealing with magic, voodoo, haunted houses, extreme qualities of perseverance and resilience. Anybody walking through those doors needs to come tooled up with a pretty robust sense of self. There has already been a vast amount of tactical analysis of Amorim\u2019s teams and of his imaginary teams of the future. He likes to play three central defenders. In an ideal world Lenny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Lisandro Mart\u00ednez could be in line to form a theoretical dream backline, which does presuppose all three are going to be fit and in form at the same time. R\u00faben? Meet Jonny Evans. He\u2019s quite useful. There is early concern over the identity of potential wing-backs, but Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot is hardly the most notable bodge of recent Manchester United selections. Manuel Ugarte should be pleased to see his former mentor turning up. United have done something new here too. Reverse-engineer it. Sign the \u00a350m holding midfielder. Then sign the right manager to actually make him work. Otherwise phrases such as intensity, pressing, short passing and high defensive lines have swirled around. And yes, we have heard this before. Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the Manchester United. Joining in the middle of the season doesn\u2019t help either. But then, this just has to be a long-term project. It is here that Amorim\u2019s record comes into focus in other ways. Why is this a good fit? Try this. Sporting sold or released 30 professional players in his first seven months at the club.

Don\u2019t talk about building, not yet. Just burn it all down. Even better, Sporting traded at a combined profit of at least \u00a3200m across his four years in charge, while still moving forward, winning and getting better. This is not just impressive but overwhelmingly on point with where United are and how the owners work. This guy: he\u2019s a one-man McKinsey. He\u2019s Ineos in a \u20ac3,000 merino wool sports coat. He\u2019s Kendall Roy striding the floor saying please leave your desks immediately, security will take your passes now. This isn\u2019t a criticism. It is instead necessary medicine at a club where filling the vast inherited hole at the heart of the midfield must go hand in hand with fixing the vast inherited hole at the heart of the institution. The astonishing amount of money spent on players endorsed by Ten Hag remains an affront to professional sports club administration. Somebody needs to fix this, recoup, regear. United have played down the significance of their recently announced \u00a3113m losses.

He attached a makeshift sling \u2013 made from kitchen trousers and carabiners (climbing-style clips) that inmates were given to keep their belongings safe from rats \u2013 to the underneath of the lorry on 1 September last year, to test whether it would be spotted on its delivery route to other prisons. \u201cI tested the security, not just in Wandsworth,\u201d he said. \u201cStrangely, over the coming days, I could see it but it wasn\u2019t spotted in Wandsworth or any other prison.\u201d On the morning of 6 September he got into the sling, facing upwards. \u201cWhen the tail lift raised it covered me entirely,\u201d he said. Although officers did \u201cnormal checks\u201d with torches, they failed to find him, despite a governor coming into the tunnel and asking whether the vehicle had been searched, he told the court. When the vehicle stopped outside the prison, he got out of the sling and lay on the ground underneath it in a \u201cprone position\u201d until it moved away. He was arrested three days later on the footpath of the Grand Union canal, after his escape sparked a nationwide manhunt. He told the court he knew that after he escaped he would be classified as a \u201cdouble A\u201d prisoner. \u201cI accept that I left the prison and I didn\u2019t have any permission,\u201d Khalife said. \u201cI accept that I shouldn\u2019t have done what I did.\u201d But he said his escape had demonstrated \u201cwhat a foolish idea it was to have someone of my skill set in prison. What use was it to anyone? \u2026 I was never a real spy.\u201d Khalife, from Kingston upon Thames, south-west London, denies a charge of committing an act prejudicial to the safety or interests of the state under the Official Secrets Act between 1 May 2019 and 6 January 2022. He has also pleaded not guilty to a charge under the Terrorism Act of eliciting information about armed forces personnel on 2 August 2021, perpetrating a bomb hoax on or before 2 January 2023 and escaping from prison on 6 September last year. The trial continues.",

Although the NHS and councils are protected from the impact of the rise in employers\u2019 national insurance contributions (NICs) announced in Wednesday\u2019s budget, charities that provide services say the increase means they will face \u201cexistential\u201d financial pressures. Family doctors and pharmacists \u2013 who provide NHS-funded services as private providers \u2013 also demanded they be exempted from the rise, saying the extra NICs costs could force a reduction in primary care services. Ministers are under pressure to intervene to prevent a financial crisis among charity providers, including those delivering high-cost care to adults with learning disabilities, severe autism, complex needs and severe physical disabilities. The backlash over NICs has thrown fresh light on the crisis facing social care, which took a backseat in the budget compared with the NHS. The health service got an extra \u00a322.6bn, while councils in England received just \u00a3600m more to cover adult and children\u2019s social care. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, has called for social care providers to be exempt from the NICs rises, while the Labour backbencher Rachael Maskell called on ministers to consider the impact of the increase on GPs, care providers and hospices. \u201cWe know that these contracted health and care services have been through a lot of financial strain under the last government, and they too need to fix their foundations and build stability for the future,\u201d Maskell said. Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, called on ministers to protect family doctor services. \u201cWe have very serious concerns about the impact of the increase in national insurance employer contributions on GP practices right across the country, many of whom are already struggling to keep their doors open and make ends meet due to historic chronic underfunding,\u201d she said.

The charity sector employs 1 million people and delivers around \u00a317bn of services a year in areas such as social care, addiction, health, homelessness and hospice care. Charities estimate they face an extra bill of \u00a31.4bn as a result of the changes.

She added: \u201cCharities across the country are already in a dire situation, juggling a triple threat of rising demand, escalating costs, falling funding. This additional cost, for which there is no headroom in budgets to cover, will be devastating.\u201d Charity social care providers, who have been in effect subsidising underfunded contracts for years, said they would be forced to \u201chand back\u201d statutory care contracts if the local authorities that funded the services failed to meet the extra costs. One boss of a social care charity that provides care for thousands of disabled adults said: \u201cWe all had a warm feeling this was a government that would listen.

Although an NICs increase was anticipated, the unexpected lowering of the salary threshold at which they are paid will bring more part-time workers into the scope of the tax, doubling planned costs for some charities. Jim Kane, the chief executive of Community Integrated Care, one of the UK\u2019s largest social care charities, said it faced a \u00a312m shortfall from next April as a result of both the NICs rises and a 6.7% boost to the national minimum wage, which could force the charity into a \u201cdeficit position\u201d and jeopardise services relied on by 3,500 adults. Rachael Dodgson, the chief executive of Dimensions, which provides services for people with learning disabilities and autism, said: \u201cIt is very clear that the actions taken in this budget do not match the rhetoric from the Department of Health and Social Care since the election about the need to fix the social care sector.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe have taken tough decisions to fix the foundations so a \u00a322bn boost for the NHS and social care could be announced at the budget. \u201cThe employer national insurance rise doesn\u2019t kick in until April, and we will set out further details on allocation of funding for next year in due course.\u201d Officials have pointed out that the government will soon enter contract negotiations with GPs, which could help mitigate the impact of the budget, although the Treasury has pushed back on suggestions they will be reimbursed.",

Fernando wasn\u2019t just a baseball player; he was a phenomenon, a Mexican kid who broke into the big leagues and made millions of people feel as if they finally belonged. With his screwball pitch and unforgettable stare to the heavens, he dominated the mound, capturing hearts in Los Angeles and in communities all over the United States. After the Dodgers\u2019 World Series victory this week, they\u2019re holding a parade on Friday \u2013 his birthday.</p>    <p>The morning after he died, I was stuck in LA traffic with my nephew Angel, trying not to cry as a live mariachi band played a tribute to Fernando on my favorite radio show. My dad called me then, also stuck in traffic on his way to work at 74 years old. We exchanged a two-word sentence in Spanish, \u201c<em>ni modo</em>,\u201d which loosely translated means \u201coh well\u201d but spiritually is translated best by Frank Sinatra\u2019s rendition of That\u2019s Life: \u201cEach time I find myself flat on my face / I pick myself up and get back in the race!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2024/oct/27/dodgers-fans-quotes-los-angeles\">\u2018The Dodgers are embedded in my soul\u2019: Los Angeles fans on what the team means to the city \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em>Ni modo</em> is the kind of phrase whose utterance simultaneously makes you want to break down crying and gives you the will to defy that feeling and carry on. So with those two words my father and I continued our days. He works as a foreman in a warehouse that distributes much of the produce you find in southern California\u2019s grocery stores. I work, mostly, from home as a writer. While my dad was working a 10-hour shift to provide fresh fruit to the nation\u2019s most populous region, I was punching up jokes on a screenplay about two soccer moms who used to be best friends but now are trying to destroy each other over a meaningless trophy. Suffice to say, neither of us had much time to cry because we were both doing equally impactful, essential jobs.</p> <p>My dad, Manuel Galindo, grew up in a little-known Mexican town obsessed with baseball. Culiac\u00e1n, Sinaloa, known now for its narco culture, is still in love with the sport, especially the city\u2019s team, Los Tomateros. Like everyone in Culiac\u00e1n, my dad was a Tomateros fan as a kid. He also admired the United States, listening to Jimi Hendrix, watching The Godfather and rooting for the Yankees.</p>    <p>When he was a student, my father was shot in the throat by narcos who didn\u2019t appreciate his smart-alec antics. The bullet missed any vital organs, and he miraculously recovered. After graduating, he migrated to Los Angeles in 1979, working odd jobs for little pay. He was still a Yankees fan until Fernando Valenzuela\u2019s 1981 season. My dad caught Fernandomania. He and his older brother even went to a playoff game that season. After that, his loyalty was torn between the Yankees and the Dodgers.</p> <p>When we were kids, our dad would take us to see the Dodgers regularly. We got to see Fernando play and my father would try his best to explain to us why he was so important. He would say things like \u201cFernando Valenzuela is the best at his job, I\u2019m the best at my job, you could be the best too.\u201d Or \u201cNo matter what you do in life, show them you\u2019re the best.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what being \u201cthe best\u201d meant until a few days ago.</p> <p>For my dad\u2019s 75th birthday this week, my brother, my nephew and I took him to his first-ever World Series game. The Dodgers were hosting the Yankees, a matchup for the ages with Japanese phenom Shohei Ohtani facing Yankee slugger Aaron Judge. My dad\u2019s two teams were going head-to-head for the first time since 1981, when Valenzuela pitched a complete game to beat the Yankees and clinch the World Series. As we slogged through Dodger Stadium\u2019s crowded entrance, my brother and nephew wondered who he was rooting for.</p>    <p>The night started with a tribute to Valenzuela, featuring his family, former teammates and a live mariachi band. The game began as a close pitching duel that would have made Fernando proud. Late in the game, the bats finally came alive: the Dodgers scored, then the Yankees took the lead. The Dodgers tied it in the eighth, sending it to extra innings. The Yankees took the lead in the 10th, and I tried not to look at my dad, it was so tense. Then it happened. With two outs and three men on base, Freddie Freeman, the son of a Canadian immigrant, hit a grand slam to win it for the Dodgers. The whole place erupted in cheers. My father started high-fiving and hugging strangers. I knew my dad could never root against Fernando, even against the Yankees, and I started to cry.</p> <p>It took me a minute, but I finally figured out why Fernando Valenzuela meant so much to me and my family. My father went from being an undocumented immigrant working under the table to becoming a US citizen with a six-figure income and a home of his own. Fernando Valenzuela was an example of an idea my father understood the moment he arrived in America: \u201cJust give me a chance, and I promise I can be great too.\u201d Fernando was the epitome of that idea. His death felt like the end of that, but now I see it\u2019s also giving me the strength to carry it forward.</p>",

After graduating, he migrated to Los Angeles in 1979, working odd jobs for little pay. He was still a Yankees fan until Fernando Valenzuela\u2019s 1981 season. My dad caught Fernandomania. He and his older brother even went to a playoff game that season. After that, his loyalty was torn between the Yankees and the Dodgers. When we were kids, our dad would take us to see the Dodgers regularly. We got to see Fernando play and my father would try his best to explain to us why he was so important. He would say things like \u201cFernando Valenzuela is the best at his job, I\u2019m the best at my job, you could be the best too.\u201d Or \u201cNo matter what you do in life, show them you\u2019re the best.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what being \u201cthe best\u201d meant until a few days ago. For my dad\u2019s 75th birthday this week, my brother, my nephew and I took him to his first-ever World Series game. The Dodgers were hosting the Yankees, a matchup for the ages with Japanese phenom Shohei Ohtani facing Yankee slugger Aaron Judge. My dad\u2019s two teams were going head-to-head for the first time since 1981, when Valenzuela pitched a complete game to beat the Yankees and clinch the World Series. As we slogged through Dodger Stadium\u2019s crowded entrance, my brother and nephew wondered who he was rooting for. The night started with a tribute to Valenzuela, featuring his family, former teammates and a live mariachi band. The game began as a close pitching duel that would have made Fernando proud. Late in the game, the bats finally came alive: the Dodgers scored, then the Yankees took the lead. The Dodgers tied it in the eighth, sending it to extra innings. The Yankees took the lead in the 10th, and I tried not to look at my dad, it was so tense. Then it happened. With two outs and three men on base, Freddie Freeman, the son of a Canadian immigrant, hit a grand slam to win it for the Dodgers. The whole place erupted in cheers. My father started high-fiving and hugging strangers. I knew my dad could never root against Fernando, even against the Yankees, and I started to cry. It took me a minute, but I finally figured out why Fernando Valenzuela meant so much to me and my family. My father went from being an undocumented immigrant working under the table to becoming a US citizen with a six-figure income and a home of his own. Fernando Valenzuela was an example of an idea my father understood the moment he arrived in America: \u201cJust give me a chance, and I promise I can be great too.\u201d Fernando was the epitome of that idea. His death felt like the end of that, but now I see it\u2019s also giving me the strength to carry it forward.",

It was a lovely feeling.\u201d Brazil had last scored in Brighton\u2019s 4-0 victory at West Ham in the Women\u2019s Super League in May 2019. </p> <p>Brazil, the daughter of the former Fulham, Newcastle and Preston forward Gary Brazil, was part of the England youth setup from an early age and played for Fiorentina before joining Brighton. She says of her knee injuries: \u201cMy first one, I was in pain but I played on because I was unaware of what an ACL was. I didn\u2019t really know what the three letters meant; they weren\u2019t really \u2018around\u2019 at that point, compared to now.

They\u2019ve become proper, lifelong friends. So I will forever support the Spurs girls. But it wasn\u2019t plain sailing. It\u2019s tested my resilience.

I just want to make sure that, if I can help in any way, that will be a role of mine this season, whether that\u2019s just to make her laugh, have a coffee with her, brighten her day, because it does get doom and gloom.\u201d</p>    <p>ACLs have plagued the women\u2019s game for years and been in the headlines in recent seasons with more and more players calling for further research. On Thursday the Leicester striker No\u00e9mie Mouchon\u2019s ACL injury was confirmed by the WSL club. Discussion continues as to the reasons why women are more susceptible to this injury, statistically, but Brazil is very measured, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t know the answers yet. A lot more research and everything that\u2019s going on currently is brilliant, so maybe one day we will get the answer, but right now we don\u2019t know. People say: \u2018I think it\u2019s because of this, I think it\u2019s because of this,\u2019 and I\u2019m like: \u2018You\u2019ll never know, though.\u2019 I try not to punish myself about it, of things that I might have done in the lead-up, or stress in my life in the lead-up, because I\u2019ll never know the answer.\u201d</p> <p>Thankfully, she is looking only forward with Charlton. They narrowly missed out on promotion last term, which Brazil says was another motivating factor behind her move to Karen Hills\u2019s team: \u201cThe fact they lost by one point last year, they have that blood-boiling feeling in them. I wanted to be part of that. I quite like that ambition.\u201d</p> <p>That desire was apparent in Charlton\u2019s most recent league game, a 3-3 draw at Newcastle where they scored twice deep into stoppage time, with Brazil providing the assist for the 95th-minute equaliser. \u201cWe have a mentality and a desire, that we will not give up until that whistle goes. It\u2019s hats off to the management for probably drilling that mentality into us in training sessions every day. But the other side of it is: \u2018We\u2019re not happy with our first-half performance, we\u2019re winners and we can\u2019t keep doing what we did in that first half if we want to get somewhere in this league.\u2019</p> <p>\u201c[This season] we just want to be in contention to win the league by the time we come back [from the winter break] in January. We just want to be there or thereabouts so we can then hit the second half of the season really hard, and see what can happen.\u201d</p>",

On Thursday the Leicester striker No\u00e9mie Mouchon\u2019s ACL injury was confirmed by the WSL club. Discussion continues as to the reasons why women are more susceptible to this injury, statistically, but Brazil is very measured, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t know the answers yet. A lot more research and everything that\u2019s going on currently is brilliant, so maybe one day we will get the answer, but right now we don\u2019t know. People say: \u2018I think it\u2019s because of this, I think it\u2019s because of this,\u2019 and I\u2019m like: \u2018You\u2019ll never know, though.\u2019 I try not to punish myself about it, of things that I might have done in the lead-up, or stress in my life in the lead-up, because I\u2019ll never know the answer.\u201d Thankfully, she is looking only forward with Charlton. They narrowly missed out on promotion last term, which Brazil says was another motivating factor behind her move to Karen Hills\u2019s team: \u201cThe fact they lost by one point last year, they have that blood-boiling feeling in them. I wanted to be part of that. I quite like that ambition.\u201d That desire was apparent in Charlton\u2019s most recent league game, a 3-3 draw at Newcastle where they scored twice deep into stoppage time, with Brazil providing the assist for the 95th-minute equaliser. \u201cWe have a mentality and a desire, that we will not give up until that whistle goes. It\u2019s hats off to the management for probably drilling that mentality into us in training sessions every day. But the other side of it is: \u2018We\u2019re not happy with our first-half performance, we\u2019re winners and we can\u2019t keep doing what we did in that first half if we want to get somewhere in this league.\u2019 \u201c[This season] we just want to be in contention to win the league by the time we come back [from the winter break] in January. We just want to be there or thereabouts so we can then hit the second half of the season really hard, and see what can happen.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Supermarkets are using multibuy promotional deals to encourage shoppers to buy meat and processed meat, despite the products being linked to a heightened risk of cancer, research reveals. Almost one in five (18%) of multibuy offers in major British supermarkets involve meat and dairy products, and one in ten (11%) processed meat such as ham, bacon and sausages. Customers are being encouraged to buy such products even though the World Health Organization says that red meat probably causes cancer and that processed meat definitely does. The Food Foundation said its findings, especially about processed meat, were alarming for environmental as well as health reasons. It accused food retailers of \u201cactively incentivising citizens to buy more of those foods that are known to be bad for the health of people and the planet\u201d. The thinktank\u2019s senior business and investor engagement manager, Rebecca Tobi, said: \u201cWe know that supermarkets routinely use buy one, get one free and price promotion deals to get us to buy more of products than we would otherwise. So the fact that many of these deals are on foods that are harming our health and our planet is alarming.\u201d Only 5% of multibuy offers involve fruit and vegetables. The Food Foundation based its findings on offers made by Aldi, Asda, Iceland, Morrison\u2019s, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco in March, when the Questionmark Foundation analysed their money-saving deals. Iceland had the most promotions on processed meat, which accounted for 15% of its multibuy deals, followed by Tesco (13%) and Asda (11%). Iceland also offered the fewest deals on fruit and veg at just 2%. \u201cDespite the fact we know too much processed meat comes with notable health risks, supermarket marketing and promotions are still very much geared towards meaty foods,\u201d Tobi said. Dr Panagiota Mitrou, the World Cancer Research Fund\u2019s director of research, policy and innovation, said: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that food retailers are using multibuy offers to make these kinds of meats a more financially attractive option to shoppers and encourage higher consumption.\u201d People should eat at most three portions of red meat a week \u2013 weighing about 12-18oz in cooked weight \u2013 and \u201clittle, if any, processed meat at all\u201d, given the evidence about meat\u2019s link with cancer, and especially processed meat\u2019s proven role in raising the risk of bowel cancer, she said.

In the UK only Lidl and the Compass Group have set sales-based targets aimed at driving higher sales of non-meat dishes. The Food Foundation\u2019s research also found that most main meals sold by major restaurant chains still contained meat, despite the strong shift in recent years towards vegetarian and vegan diets. Among the 63 high street restaurants analysed, 58% of their main meals involved meat, down from 62% in 2022, 33% were meatless and 9% involved fish. Joe and the Juice had the highest proportion of meat-free main dishes at 69%, followed by Sainsbury\u2019s cafes (59%) and Pizza Express (57%).

      "body": "<p>Simon Jenkins provides a timely account of how, from the 1960s onwards, plans for wholesale demolition of large parts of urban areas began to be challenged (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/oct/28/ransacking-britain-sod-you-architecture-corbusier\">The ransacking of Britain: why the people finally rose up against \u2018sod you architecture\u2019, 28 October</a>). He cites the 1974 Covent Garden revolt, which saw citizens, enlightened planners such as Ian Robert Christie \u2013 whose legacy is to be honoured by a new award for planning achievement at the University of Liverpool \u2013 and eventually politicians questioning the previously axiomatic tenets of comprehensive redevelopment. Christie\u2019s work made some then rather novel proposals such as that the whole area should be designated a conservation area, the existing street pattern should be retained, and housing policy should ensure that low-income residents were not displaced.</p> <p>Such suggestions illustrate that while, as Jenkins argues, better plans and cities may not be realised until Britons \u201clearn to speak architecture\u201d, there are also other matters to consider, if as a society we are to get better urban places to live in. These include a wider appreciation of townscape, how different forms of development deliver or hinder sought-after social, economic, environmental, or cultural goals, and how citizens can engage in the planning process.</p> <p>All this also requires recruitment into the planning profession, proper resourcing of the planning service to reverse the post-2010 decline in its capacity, and greater attention to planning in citizenship education. The outcome of such measures would hopefully be a citizenry and planning practice better placed to resist and positively reshape present and future proposals for \u201csod you\u201d development across our cities and urban areas.<br><strong>Olivier Sykes</strong><br><em>University of Liverpool</em></p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins recounts meeting Liverpool\u2019s planning consultant Graeme Shankland in the 1960s, who he compares to \u201cBomber\u201d Harris. There are certainly aspects of Shankland\u2019s Liverpool plan, not least the urban motorway, that were swept up in the neophilia of the 1960s, but Shankland was not influenced by Le Corbusier, who he was vocally critical of. His professed influences were current Swedish architecture, William Morris, and contemporary sociologists, many of whom were his friends. Shankland prophetically envisioned Liverpool as a tourist destination, and collaborated with the Liverpudlian architectural historian Quentin Hughes, whose guidance on architectural preservation became official policy in 1967. <br><strong>Dr Otto Saumarez Smith</strong><br><em>University of Warwick</em></p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins says T Dan Smith \u201cbegan to demolish the city\u2019s Georgian Grainger Town\u201d. Smith was actually the saviour of Georgian Newcastle. One of his earliest actions on becoming council leader in 1959 was to revoke planning permission for a bank to construct a modern office block on Grey Street, in the heart of Grainger Town. The 1963 city development plan drawn up by Newcastle\u2019s chief planning officer Wilfred Burns under Smith\u2019s leadership pioneered the concept of conservation districts to protect historic areas of the city \u2013 such as Grainger Town \u2013 from inappropriate development. This influenced government policy, and legislation enabling conservation areas was passed in 1967.<br><strong>John Griffiths</strong><br><em>Newcastle upon Tyne</em></p> <p>\u2022 In the mid-60s, as a young married student with two children, I worked the long summer holidays labouring on building sites. One was Manchester\u2019s Hulme development mentioned in Simon Jenkins\u2019 fine polemic. The Hulme Crescents were constructed from pre-cast slabs which included window and door openings; they were craned in and stacked like dominos one on top of the other \u2013 the second fixers then came with the doors, windows, cables etc to finish the job. They were built in a horseshoe curve with a critical degree of bend so that if they collapsed they would only go so far before the angle would be great enough to stop further collapse. The rats and cockroaches moved in as we were working, and it was obvious that with no insulation the concrete would cause condensation once the&nbsp;first kettle went on the boil.</p> <p>I pointed this out to the ganger. I will never forget his answer \u2013 he was a Mayo man and not frightened of speaking his mind: \u201cSure, I know that and you know that, and the site foreman knows that, and the town planner knows that, and the lord mayor knows that, and even the fucken\u2019 lord mayor\u2019s cat and budgie knows that, but it\u2019s like a steamroller going\u2019 downhill \u2013 there\u2019s too much money and influence involved. It\u2019ll be finished \u2013 and it\u2019ll be knocked down in 30 years.\u201d</p> <p>If my memory is right, he was about two years out \u2013 and the people of Manchester only stopped paying off the cost of the experiment a few years ago. There has never to my knowledge been any inquiry \u2013 and Manchester is now throwing up a forest of foreign money mega-towers in Manhattan on Irwell.<br><strong>Mike Harding</strong><br><em>Manchester</em></p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins\u2019 article about the brutalist \u201csod you architecture\u201d imposed on British cities in the 1960s reminded me of something my father was told: that the crane being used to demolish those disastrous tower blocks in Hulme in the 1990s was the same one that had put them up. <br><strong>Catherine McLoughlin</strong> <br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Contrary to popular belief, brutalism doesn\u2019t mean that the architecture is brutal. In fact it refers to b\u00e9ton brut, or raw concrete. Typically it means concrete where the marks of the shuttering are left visible, as a surface design. One of the best examples is the National Theatre. Not all concrete is brutalist, but all brutalism is b\u00e9ton brut. In fact you could build anything out of b\u00e9ton brut, although we now know it would be better not to, largely because of its very high environmental footprint, lack of breathability etc.</p> <p>Now that we understand embodied carbon (some of us, at least), it becomes clear that we should be trying to prolong the lives and livability of many of the buildings Simon Jenkins excoriates. French architects Lacaton &amp; Vassal showed this could be done with the blocks of social housing they saved in Paris, winning the Pritzker prize in the process.

      "bodyText": "Simon Jenkins provides a timely account of how, from the 1960s onwards, plans for wholesale demolition of large parts of urban areas began to be challenged (The ransacking of Britain: why the people finally rose up against \u2018sod you architecture\u2019, 28 October). He cites the 1974 Covent Garden revolt, which saw citizens, enlightened planners such as Ian Robert Christie \u2013 whose legacy is to be honoured by a new award for planning achievement at the University of Liverpool \u2013 and eventually politicians questioning the previously axiomatic tenets of comprehensive redevelopment. Christie\u2019s work made some then rather novel proposals such as that the whole area should be designated a conservation area, the existing street pattern should be retained, and housing policy should ensure that low-income residents were not displaced. Such suggestions illustrate that while, as Jenkins argues, better plans and cities may not be realised until Britons \u201clearn to speak architecture\u201d, there are also other matters to consider, if as a society we are to get better urban places to live in. These include a wider appreciation of townscape, how different forms of development deliver or hinder sought-after social, economic, environmental, or cultural goals, and how citizens can engage in the planning process. All this also requires recruitment into the planning profession, proper resourcing of the planning service to reverse the post-2010 decline in its capacity, and greater attention to planning in citizenship education. The outcome of such measures would hopefully be a citizenry and planning practice better placed to resist and positively reshape present and future proposals for \u201csod you\u201d development across our cities and urban areas. Olivier Sykes University of Liverpool \u2022 Simon Jenkins recounts meeting Liverpool\u2019s planning consultant Graeme Shankland in the 1960s, who he compares to \u201cBomber\u201d Harris. There are certainly aspects of Shankland\u2019s Liverpool plan, not least the urban motorway, that were swept up in the neophilia of the 1960s, but Shankland was not influenced by Le Corbusier, who he was vocally critical of. His professed influences were current Swedish architecture, William Morris, and contemporary sociologists, many of whom were his friends. Shankland prophetically envisioned Liverpool as a tourist destination, and collaborated with the Liverpudlian architectural historian Quentin Hughes, whose guidance on architectural preservation became official policy in 1967. Dr Otto Saumarez Smith University of Warwick \u2022 Simon Jenkins says T Dan Smith \u201cbegan to demolish the city\u2019s Georgian Grainger Town\u201d. Smith was actually the saviour of Georgian Newcastle. One of his earliest actions on becoming council leader in 1959 was to revoke planning permission for a bank to construct a modern office block on Grey Street, in the heart of Grainger Town. The 1963 city development plan drawn up by Newcastle\u2019s chief planning officer Wilfred Burns under Smith\u2019s leadership pioneered the concept of conservation districts to protect historic areas of the city \u2013 such as Grainger Town \u2013 from inappropriate development. This influenced government policy, and legislation enabling conservation areas was passed in 1967. John Griffiths Newcastle upon Tyne \u2022 In the mid-60s, as a young married student with two children, I worked the long summer holidays labouring on building sites. One was Manchester\u2019s Hulme development mentioned in Simon Jenkins\u2019 fine polemic. The Hulme Crescents were constructed from pre-cast slabs which included window and door openings; they were craned in and stacked like dominos one on top of the other \u2013 the second fixers then came with the doors, windows, cables etc to finish the job. They were built in a horseshoe curve with a critical degree of bend so that if they collapsed they would only go so far before the angle would be great enough to stop further collapse. The rats and cockroaches moved in as we were working, and it was obvious that with no insulation the concrete would cause condensation once the first kettle went on the boil. I pointed this out to the ganger. I will never forget his answer \u2013 he was a Mayo man and not frightened of speaking his mind: \u201cSure, I know that and you know that, and the site foreman knows that, and the town planner knows that, and the lord mayor knows that, and even the fucken\u2019 lord mayor\u2019s cat and budgie knows that, but it\u2019s like a steamroller going\u2019 downhill \u2013 there\u2019s too much money and influence involved. It\u2019ll be finished \u2013 and it\u2019ll be knocked down in 30 years.\u201d If my memory is right, he was about two years out \u2013 and the people of Manchester only stopped paying off the cost of the experiment a few years ago. There has never to my knowledge been any inquiry \u2013 and Manchester is now throwing up a forest of foreign money mega-towers in Manhattan on Irwell. Mike Harding Manchester \u2022 Simon Jenkins\u2019 article about the brutalist \u201csod you architecture\u201d imposed on British cities in the 1960s reminded me of something my father was told: that the crane being used to demolish those disastrous tower blocks in Hulme in the 1990s was the same one that had put them up. Catherine McLoughlin London \u2022 Contrary to popular belief, brutalism doesn\u2019t mean that the architecture is brutal. In fact it refers to b\u00e9ton brut, or raw concrete. Typically it means concrete where the marks of the shuttering are left visible, as a surface design. One of the best examples is the National Theatre. Not all concrete is brutalist, but all brutalism is b\u00e9ton brut. In fact you could build anything out of b\u00e9ton brut, although we now know it would be better not to, largely because of its very high environmental footprint, lack of breathability etc. Now that we understand embodied carbon (some of us, at least), it becomes clear that we should be trying to prolong the lives and livability of many of the buildings Simon Jenkins excoriates. French architects Lacaton &amp; Vassal showed this could be done with the blocks of social housing they saved in Paris, winning the Pritzker prize in the process. Most of the failed blocks anywhere have failed because of lack of maintenance and social inequality. Almost invariably they are social housing. The Barbican, which Simon Jenkins mentions, remains popular, successful and mostly pretty exclusive. In Marseille the Unit\u00e9 d\u2019Habitation by the hated Le Corbusier is well-maintained and highly sought-after. Judith Martin Winchester \u2022 I would say that, as far as Plymouth was concerned \u2013 and it had suffered much from the Blitz\u2013 we avoided most of that shabby brutalism of the 60s, and most would consider Patrick Abercrombie\u2019s plan for Plymouth a success.

This legislation blitz comes on top of an existing health crisis in the West Bank, related to the Palestinian Authority\u2019s fiscal crisis with Israel\u2019s withholding of tax revenues, to the suspension of 40%-50% of travel permits for medical care within Israel since 7 October 2023, and also related to the decrease in Israel-provided healthcare in the West Bank. As Israeli physicians who have long treated Palestinian patients in Israel and in volunteer-run clinics in the West Bank and East Jerusalem \u2013 with the aid of humanitarian organisations such as Unrwa \u2013 and who can no longer contact the organisation or get medications or medical supplies for our patients, we feel it is necessary we speak out against this blatant injustice. Importantly, numerous Israeli physicians and medical personnel have recently co-signed a support letter for the American medical professionals who are against the ongoing health crisis in Gaza, and sent it directly to the White House, urging Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to stop the disaster in Gaza. The Israeli legislation scheme against Unrwa is going to annihilate healthcare in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, on top of the unbearable catastrophe in the Gaza Strip.

      "bodyText": "Six teenagers have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 13-year-old girl was stabbed in the neck. The two girls and four boys are in police custody after the attack in the town of Hessle, near Hull, which left the victim with life-threatening injuries. Humberside police said members of the public came to help the girl when she was seen injured at the side of the A63 dual carriageway shortly before 7am on Friday. She had multiple \u201clacerations\u201d to her neck, abdomen, chest and back, the force said. Officers searched a wooded area nearby and arrested two girls aged 14 and 15 and four boys, aged 14, 15, 16 and 17, on suspicion of attempted murder. The victim remained in a critical condition in hospital on Friday night. Det Supt Simon Vickers said it was believed the attackers knew the victim. He said: \u201cI understand this incident will rightly cause concerns amongst the community and I would like to offer my assurances that as a part of our initial investigation we have six individuals in custody who are all being questioned by detectives.\u201d Vickers said there would be an increased police presence in the area over the weekend and urged members of the public to report any concerns. He added: \u201cThere are currently cordons in place surrounding the wooded area off Ferriby High Road to allow emergency services to work safely and follow multiple lines of enquiry. \u201cI would also like to thank the members of the public who came to the aid of the girl and assisted her at the roadside before emergency services arrived. \u201cIf you have any information that may assist officers, or if you have dashcam or CCTV footage from around the time of the incident, please contact us on our non-emergency number 101, quoting log 82 of 1 November.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The US asked Lebanon to declare a unilateral ceasefire to revive stalled talks to end hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, according to a report later denied by the Lebanese prime minister Two unnamed sources, a Lebanese political source and a senior diplomat, made the claim to Reuters, saying the US envoy, Amos Hochstein, had communicated the proposal to Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, this week. The Biden administration, which critics say has made a series of missteps in its handling of the wars in Gaza and Lebanon, has come up with a number of proposals to end the fighting in both conflicts, all of which have come to nothing. Top UN officials warned the situation in the northern Gaza Strip was \u201capocalyptic\u201d as Israel pursues a military offensive against Hamas militants in the area, adding that large parts of the population were at risk of dying from hunger and disease. The latest flurry of US diplomacy, during which the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, again appeared more optimistic than parties to the conflict about bringing it to an end, comes against the backdrop of the US presidential election next week. Mikati\u2019s office, however, denied in a statement that the US had asked Lebanon to declare a unilateral ceasefire. He said his government\u2019s stance was clear on seeking a ceasefire from both sides and implementation of UN security council resolution 1701, which ended the last round of conflict between the two foes in 2006. Lebanon\u2019s armed forces are not involved in the hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, which began firing rockets at Israeli military sites a year ago in solidarity with its Palestinian ally Hamas in Gaza. Any effort to reach a ceasefire would need a green light from Hezbollah, which has ministers in Lebanon\u2019s cabinet and whose members and allies hold a significant number of seats in Lebanon\u2019s parliament. The US embassy in Beirut did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The sources said Washington had sought to persuade Beirut to take back some initiative in the talks, particularly given the perception that Israel was likely to continue military operations that have already killed most of Hezbollah\u2019s leadership and destroyed much of the country\u2019s south. Diplomats mediate with Hezbollah through the group\u2019s ally Nabih Berri, the speaker of parliament. Hezbollah has said it backs Berri\u2019s efforts to reach a ceasefire but that a deal must meet certain parameters without providing details. A unilateral declaration was seen as a non-starter in Lebanon, the sources said, because it would probably be equated with a surrender. Israeli officials have been pushing for a \u201cside letter\u201d from the US in which Washington would guarantee Israel\u2019s freedom to take military action in response to any violation of a ceasefire deal by Hezbollah. Lebanese parties, including Hezbollah, are highly unlikely to accept such a letter. Talks about a ceasefire foundered as Mikati accused Israel of stubbornness in the negotiations, while the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said his priority was to impose security \u201cdespite any pressure or constraints\u201d. The hostilities have eroded the prospect of a truce being reached before the US election on Tuesday. The claims emerged as Israel\u2019s air force continued to bombard Beirut\u2019s southern suburb of Dahiyeh overnight, destroying dozens of buildings in several neighbourhoods, Lebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency said on Friday. Lebanese authorities said that 45 people were killed in airstrikes on villages in the Beqaa Valley. Israel has recently intensified its airstrikes on the north-eastern city of Baalbek and nearby villages, and parts of southern Lebanon. International mediators are increasing their efforts to halt the wars in Lebanon and Gaza, circulating fresh proposals to de-escalate the regional conflict. The UN warning over the catastrophic situation in northern Gaza was delivered in a joint statement signed by the heads of UN agencies, including the children\u2019s agency Unicef and the World Food Programme, and other aid groups. \u201cThe entire Palestinian population in north Gaza is at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine and violence,\u201d the groups warned, underlining growing international alarm over Israel\u2019s intentions in the area. Israel began a wide military push in northern Gaza earlier this month. The US said it was watching to ensure its ally\u2019s actions on the ground showed it did not have a \u201cpolicy of starvation\u201d in the north. \u201cHumanitarian aid cannot keep up with the scale of the needs due to the access constraints. Basic, life-saving goods are not available. Humanitarians are not safe to do their work and are blocked by Israeli forces and by insecurity from reaching people in need,\u201d the aid groups said. The Israeli military said on Friday it had killed a senior Hamas official, Izz al-Din Kassab, describing him as one of the last high-ranking members of Hamas responsible for coordinating with other groups in Gaza, in an airstrike in Khan Younis. Medics in Gaza said about 60 people had been killed and dozens injured overnight and into Friday morning in Israeli strikes on the city of Deir al-Balah, the Nuseirat camp and the town of al-Zawayda, all in central Gaza, as well as in the south.

Across the whole of the US, however, it\u2019s screening in fewer than 50 cinemas. Starting small then rolling out nationwide is a common strategy for movies being positioned as awards contenders. Yet this is not the case for Juror#2, which will not expand its screen number \u2013 and does not even feature on Warner Bros\u2019s For Your Consideration website, its portal for Oscar hopefuls. Stranger still, Warners has said it will not report box office takings for the film \u2013 an almost unprecedented move for a theatrical release \u2013 and that the film is likely to move to streaming before the month is out. At the film\u2019s premiere at the AFI festival last week, Eastwood was nowhere to be seen, leaving it to Hoult and co-star Toni Collette to trot up the red carpet and spearhead an audience shout-out to the director: \u201cWe love you, Clint!\u201d His absence led many to the conclusion the nonagenarian was ailing, his health worsened by the sudden death in July of his partner, 61-year-old Christina Sandera, and the arrest in October of his daughter, Francesca, on a domestic assault charge. Yet a post on his official X account from 15 October shows the film-maker grinning in a leather jacket and, according to the caption, \u201creturning to work, reviewing scripts in his Malpaso [o]ffices\u201d. The Guardian has contacted Warners and representatives of Eastwood for comment.

The contrasting success of Oppenheimer will also still be stinging: Christopher Nolan called time on his long relationship with the studio in 2021 over their new day-in-date simultaneous streaming strategy, meaning his new film was released instead by Universal Pictures \u2013 for whom it made $975m. Meanwhile, Eastwood is back at work considering his next project as director while also working as producer on a new version of his 1977 film The Gauntlet, starring Tom Cruise and Scarlett Johansson.

      "bodyText": "Ministers have been told that a plan to ban the sale of disposable vapes by next summer could lead to some users \u201creverting or relapsing\u201d back to cigarette smoking. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said vape usage in England had grown by more than 400% between 2012 and 2023, with 9.1% of the public buying and using the products. Legislation set to be introduced to parliament this year will ban the sale of single-use vapes in England, in part to limit the environmental damage they cause. However, an impact assessment by Defra revealed that \u201c29% of current [people who vape] will either revert/relapse to smoking tobacco\u201d as a result of the ban. Officials said \u201cif the ban is increasing use of cigarettes there could be health disbenefits\u201d. The report added: \u201cWe have assumed that most users of disposable vapes will switch to reusable vapes, however there will be a proportion of users that may revert back to smoking tobacco or quit vaping and smoking altogether.\u201d The legislation had been tabled under Rishi Sunak\u2019s premiership, but the government ran out of time in the last parliament. The tobacco and vapes bill would prevent anyone born from 2009 from legally smoking by gradually raising the age at which tobacco can be bought. It also aims to impose restrictions on the sale and marketing of vapes to children. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, said this month he planned to introduce the bill \u201cbefore Christmas\u201d. The Labour MP Mary Glindon criticised the chancellor\u2019s tax increase on vape liquid during the budget debate, saying it could discourage people from quitting smoking. Glindon, the MP for Newcastle upon Tyne East and Wallsend, said the increase, to take place in October 2026, was \u201cunsustainably high\u201d and would \u201churt working people\u201d who used vapes. In the budget, Rachel Reeves also set out increases of 2% on tobacco and 10% for hand-rolled tobacco. It followed a study that suggested about 1 million adults in England now vaped despite never being regular smokers. The research published in Lancet Public Health looked at survey data collected between 2016 and 2024 from 153,073 adults in England, of whom 94,107 had never regularly smoked tobacco. Before 2021, the proportion of never-regular-smokers who vaped in England was low, at an average of 0.5% between 2016 and 2020. This increased to 3.5% by April 2024, equating to about 1 million vapers. Among these, more than half \u2013 an estimated 588,000 \u2013 were aged between 18 and 24, the study found. A separate study led by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) indicated that banning the sale of tobacco to people born between 2006 and 2010 could prevent 1.2 million lung cancer deaths by 2095. It has been estimated that almost 5m single-use vapes were either littered or thrown away in general waste every week in the UK \u2013 almost four times as much as the previous year. A government spokesperson said: \u201cOur changes will protect a whole generation of children from being drawn in to the dangers of smoking and nicotine addiction.

And I\u2019ll leave you with Football Daily, which has just landed online and will be coming to your email inbox any minute now. Mercifully, it\u2019s not about R\u00faben Amorim \u2013 there\u2019s plenty to read about him elsewhere on the website \u2013 but the entertaining world of the Championship. Bye and enjoy! If you\u2019ve already got Amorim fatigue then this comes with our apologies, but since it\u2019s been the news of the day it\u2019s interesting to see the reaction from inside the Manchester United camp. And who better than Portugal international Diogo Dalot to provide the insight on his fellow countryman? \u201cHe is a fantastic coach and knows what he wants. Very demanding is what I can expect. It\u2019s a perfect match for a club like this,\u201d Dalot told Sky Sports. \u201cThe Premier League suits people from Portugal. We have a culture of constantly trying to improve ourselves as we come from a small country. I really hope that it is one more case. I am really excited to start working with him.\u201d Howe is Eddie faring? Louise Taylor with the analysis. A native Portuguese speaker has helpfully advised us all how to pronounce the main man\u2019s name. Manuel Alves emails in: \u201cIn case anyone is interested in \u2018hearing\u2019 from a Portuguese speaker, here is how to pronounce R\u00faben Amorim: Roo-ben Amor-ing (say the \u201cing\u201d part without sounding out the \u201cg\u201d). \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if you wanted to say the phrase \u2018a moor\u2019 with the same emphasis as you\u2019d say \u2018a door\u2019. Most people say the first part of his last name well enough but then they make the mistake of closing their lips on the last syllable \u2014 that \u2018m\u2019 at the end is usually the problem.\u201d SO NOW YOU KNOW. There\u2019s not a whole heap of optimism re R\u00faben Amorim in my inbox. Sorry Roobs. Norman Hansen: \u201cThe problem at Manchester United has not been the manager since Fergie left. The problem is that they have for many years now brought in players who are not good enough. Alexis S\u00e1nchez anyone? Pogba? Harry Maguire? Fred? Depay? Lukaku? Antony? And not only have they brought in mediocre players, they have overpaid for them. Until they fix the incoming transfer problem, they will not fix their position in the table.\u201d Andrew Benton: \u201cThe task ahead for Amorim is an impossible one \u2013 to bring back the glory days. They\u2019ve gone and won\u2019t return, they were once in a lifetime, so many things fell into place at the time and the team evolved into various forms of greatness, but with a core functionality that worked brilliantly for years. So he\u2019s left with doing what? Staving off more failures, avoiding the drop? I give him until the end of the season at the latest.\u201d McKenna has his own message for Amorim as a former United coach \u2013 and one-time Old Trafford managerial candidate: He said: \u201cI wish him all the best. It is a club I have an affinity with and always want to see them do well, hopefully not in the game that is coming up [against Ipswich]. \u201cOther than that I wish them all the best and I\u2019m sure he will be a good addition to the league.\u201d Three teams are incredibly still winless after nine Premier League games this season, yet all three managers of said clubs have survived the chop thus far. There is the infamous November international break lurking, though, which will surely spell trouble for someone.. Of the trio, Gary O\u2019Neil feels under the most pressure because, for all his ranting and raving against VAR and the lack of funds available to him in the summer, the simple truth is that few foresaw Wolves\u2019 struggles this season. \u201cWe are going to attack it full throttle,\u201d O\u2019Neil says on their clash with Crystal Palace on Saturday teatime. There\u2019s little room for failure. The two other winless sides are promoted Southampton and Ipswich, with Saints\u2019 Russell Martin seemingly facing far more scrutiny than Kieran McKenna. \u201cWe haven\u2019t felt like we have come away with what we should have,\u201d Martin told journalists today, presumably a nod to the impressive underlying numbers Southampton are racking up while failing to win. At home to Everton this weekend, only one number matters. They have to win. The same can be said of Ipswich, who are at home to Leicester. It\u2019s a big weekend down at the bottom. Renee Slegers says she will remain as Arsenal\u2019s interim head coach for the team\u2019s next five fixtures. The Dutchwoman, who had been working as assistant boss, was placed in temporary charge when Jonas Eidevall resigned on October 15. Slegers has since overseen a 4-1 Champions League victory over Valerenga and 2-0 Women\u2019s Super League victory at West Ham. Between now and the next international break, Arsenal have WSL matches against Manchester United, at Leigh Sports Village on Sunday, Brighton and Tottenham, as well as facing Juventus home and away in the European competition. And Slegers told a press conference on Friday: \u201cI\u2019ll be in the interim role for this block, that\u2019s what I know. So this block, these five games.\u201d Asked if she could see herself doing the job longer term, Slegers said: \u201cI definitely see myself doing it at the moment because I enjoy working with the girls, for the club, trying to get successes. I really enjoy the role, but obviously if you do it over a longer time it becomes different. But the work I\u2019m doing now, I\u2019m really enjoying my role at the moment.\u201d PA Uh, oh, bad news for Palace. Dwight Yorke has been appointed as the new head coach of Trinidad and Tobago. It is the former Manchester United striker\u2019s second job in management, after a spell in charge of Australian club side Macarthur and he will be tasked with World Cup qualification, as the nation target a spot at the 2026 tournament in North America. Yorke said: \u201cAs a player I experienced some incredible moments in a Trinidad and Tobago shirt. With this squad I hope they can continue as head coach. \u201cThe opportunity to work with this talented, close-knit group of players is something I look forward to.\u201d Yorke, who also played for Aston Villa, Sunderland and Blackburn, will work alongside former T&amp;T teammate Angus Eve and the current interim head coach, Derek King. Some will view these comments from the Manchester City boss as a thinly-veiled dig at Manchester United and their incoming manager. In all likelihood, Guardiola is just probably not that interested in answering questions on another club, especially one 13 places below City in the table. \u201cWelcome to Manchester United, to England, and I congratulate him next Tuesday [when City play Sporting]. We faced each other two or three seasons ago in the Champions League so yeah, welcome... No advice. I\u2019m not the right person to give advice to colleagues. Not because he\u2019s [at] United, I think they have a lot of people in United that will tell him the situation in the club, so I cannot give him advice\u2026 Will Amorim say \u2018mate\u2019 as often as Big Ange? No. Will Amorim become Big Ange\u2019s big mate? Maybe. From Ben to Rio \u2013 and the latter has a ringing endorsement of R\u00faben Amorim via Nani. \u201cHey Dom,\u201d emails Ben Monroe-Lake. \u201cI\u2019m not a United fan, so as is customary, I\u2019ve been greatly enjoying them flapping in the wind since Fergie left. Especially as they have taken the mantle of (sigh) banter club from my beloved Arsenal. \u201cThe feeling I have now is exactly the same as I had when Ten Hag was hired. That of creeping fear. They\u2019ve hired a systems manager! They are sorting out the backroom! Transfers won\u2019t be overseen by a bunch of salesmen! \u201cYet, as we all know, none of it mattered and it all went wrong and now everything is exactly the same as it was then. I have no idea if Amorim is good enough to take on this job but for the sake of my personal enjoyment, I hope he continues in Ten Hag\u2019s illustrious work. (I\u2019m sorry United fans).\u201d I wish I could tell United fans it\u2019s all going to be different now but the evidence gives more weight to Ben\u2019s argument, as it stands. Maresca has also been asked about his fellow Enzo \u2013 Fernandez \u2013 with the Chelsea midfielder coming in for criticism of late and finding himself on the fringes of the Blues\u2019 first choice XI. Romeo Lavia has partnered Moises Caicedo in Chelsea\u2019s past two Premier League games \u2013 a combination that Maresca will surely stick with against United on Sunday. \u201cDon\u2019t look just at Enzo,\u201d said Maresca. \u201cI still trust Enzo, there is no reason in the world I can lose confidence in him. The reason why he is not playing in the Premier League is because I take another decision but my confidence is 100% with Enzo. \u201cI like to say that we don\u2019t have an A or B team. There are players that are fantastic but we don\u2019t have indispensable players. If Cole [Palmer] isn\u2019t playing, we play Joao [Felix]. If Nico [Jackson] doesn\u2019t play, we play Christo [Nkunku]. There is not one we can\u2019t change. \u201cThe reason why we change players is because they\u2019re all good. You are looking for some different reasons for Enzo but he is going to play for sure in the future. It doesn\u2019t mean Romeo and Moises are always going to play.\u201d A bit more from Ange on Van de Ven\u2019s absence and Tottenham\u2019s other injury issues: Postecoglou: \u201cHe was disappointed, obviously, and he was looking forward to the [Man City] game so a bit emotional, but it\u2019s definitely not a bad one like last time which kept him out for a while.\u201d Cristian Romero and Timo Werner were also brought off in midweek and will be assessed before Sunday\u2019s fixture at home to Villa. Spurs captain Son Heung-min missed the City match after a setback with a recent hamstring injury, but returned to training on Friday. Postecoglou added: \u201cThe others were Romero and Werner, but at the moment still a chance for the weekend. Son has trained today. If he gets through training tomorrow, he should be OK.\u201d I always enjoy your handover posts, John, triffic little stint that. Have I missed anything? (Insert relevant emoji). That\u2019s my short but sweet hour on the blog done. Now for the Cheadle charmer, Dom Booth. Good/bad news for Micky van der Ven, clearly distressed as he left the field against Manchester City. Here\u2019s Ange, ahead of Tottenham\u2019s Sunday game with Villa. \u201cHe has strained his hamstring. It\u2019s not too serious but probably after the international break for him. He was disappointed, obviously, and he was looking forward to the [Manchester City] game so a bit emotional, but it\u2019s definitely not a bad one like last time, which kept him out for a while.\u201d If Amorim flops? (When, not if?) I made this rather popular suggestion earlier this week. Joe Pearson gets in touch: \u201cThat post with the links to all the managerial appointments at Man U made this Liverpool supporter laugh out loud (no really). I wonder if the Germans have a word for that feeling.\u201d Maresca on Amorim: \u201cFirst of all, all the best to him. If they took that decision, it\u2019s because they think it\u2019s the best one.\u2019 Enzo Maresca on Manchester United v Chelsea. He and Ruud van Nistelrooy were teammates. \u201cI didn\u2019t speak with Ruud. I will give him a big hug before the game. We expect a tough game. Fantastic guy. Humble, very professional. Unfortunately I share with him a time where he was already finished but you could still see how good he was. We had a very good group of human beings with Malaga. It\u2019s nice to remember that kind of moment.\u201d Here\u2019s those 13 outfield players Pep Guardiola has fit for Bournemouth tomorrow. Still good enough to beat anyone? Yes. Defenders: Nathan Ake, Ruben Dias, Josko Gvardiol, Rico Lewis, John Stones, Josh Wilson-Esbrand Midfielders: Phil Foden, Ilkay Gundogan, Mateo Kovacic, James McAtee, Matheus Nunes, Bernardo Silva Forward: Erling Haaland We\u2019ve been here before, haven\u2019t we? A new dawn has broken, has it not? Though there\u2019s been a few new dawns over the last 11 years. Amorim is the youngest manager/head coach to take the Old Trafford reins since Wilf McGuinness in 1969: Wilf was 31, and all his hair fell out. Matt Busby was 36, a former captain of Manchester City. And with that I\u2019ll hand over to the excellent John Brewin. I couldn\u2019t think of a better man to usher in this new era at Manchester United. Thanks all. Hope you enjoy the footy this weekend! Jake Powell wins the quiz question of the day: For Portuguese managers you\u2019ve got: Mourinho, AVB, Marco Silva, Nuno, and the hard ones are Carlos Carvahal at Swansea and Bruno Lage at Wolves. I could have sworn Lage was Southampton but apparently not. He\u2019s got Southampton vibes though. That\u2019s bang on. Of course Jose is the big dog with three league titles, five domestic cups and the Europa League he won with Man United. Sporting have confirmed that they\u2019ll receive around \u00a310.6 million from Manchester United for Ruben Amorim. This included extra payments to release him from his 30-day notice period. A statement from Sporting read: \u201cSporting has reached an agreement with Manchester United FC (hereinafter MUFC) in relation to the terms and conditions of the departure of coach R\u00faben Amorim, in return for which MUFC will pay Sporting \u20ac11,000,000 (\u00a39.2m). \u201cIn addition, Sporting will have a benefit of \u20ac1,658,000 (\u00a31.4m), relating to the extinction of credit rights, recorded as liabilities and contingent liabilities, as a result of the revocation and renegotiation of contracts relating to intermediation commissions. Lisbon, November 1, 2024. The Market Relations Representative.\u201d Here\u2019s a story of hope and inspiration written by one of our best. I\u2019m such a fan of Ed Aarons, especially when he delves into stories like this one: Ruben Amorim will only take charge of Manchester United on 11 November. But hist first game as manager will come 13 days later when the Red Decils travel to Ipswich on Sunday 24 November. There he\u2019ll meet a former United coach Kieran McKenna, who was an outside chance for the top job at Old Trafford. Ryan Yates wants to play for England. The Nottingham Forest midfielder has been instrumental so far this season, playing a key role in propelling the club to seventh in the league. \u201cIt\u2019s always a possibility,\u201d the 26-year-old said of his international ambitions. \u201cIt is every young boy\u2019s dream to play for their country. I feel like I am playing really well, but I feel like I can give even more. \u201cI feel I have got plenty more to come. I honestly take each day as it comes, but I want to keep improving and I never say never to anything. \u201cI just look back when I was on loan at Barrow, Scunthorpe and Shrewsbury and now I am playing in the Premier League with Forest, third season, anything is possible because there were some dark times when I was on loan.\u201d Amorim will become the seventh Portuguese manager in Premier League history. Without Googling, can you name the other six? I\u2019ll give it 30 minutes before sharing the answers. Someone get in touch with the Football Cliches podcast crew, we\u2019ve got something for Amorim\u2019s \u201cin-tray\u201d. Jokes aside, there\u2019s a lot to fix and the new boss will have plenty to ponder as he settles in the hot seat. Will Unwin has selected a few key areas that need a tweak, including centre backs, the midfield and a lack of goals. So basically everything: There\u2019ll be more to come on the main story of the day but we shift momentarily to hear from Steve Cooper who insists he\u2019s not feeling any extra pressure as Leicester\u2019s manager. The Foxes head to Ipswich with both teams in the bottom six. Ipswich haven\u2019t won a game yet and have just four points from nine games. Five points ahead of them in 15th, Leicester have found some form with seven points from their last four matches. \u201cI think they are all significant [games] because whoever you play, you get that win and it can make such a difference, as we\u2019ve seen with the two wins we\u2019ve got already,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should assume that anyone should be anywhere. It\u2019s more about living in the moment, respecting who you\u2019re playing against. \u201cYou have to earn the right to make things happen against every opponent. When we\u2019ve been at our best, it\u2019s been about what we do in games.\u201d Is this the man who turns things around at Old Trafford? The deal is done! Good luck to the 39-year-old who takes on what seems like the almost impossible job of restoring Manchester United to their former glory. Whether he succeeds or not, this will be a story to keep a close eye on. Let\u2019s hear from Brighton\u2019s boss, Fabian Hurzeler now. It\u2019s a tough ask facing both Liverpool and Man City in back-to-back games, but he\u2019s confident his Gulls can hold their own at Anfield this weekend. \u201cNow we can prove to ourselves how far we are as a team and how ready we are to really challenge the establishment,\u201d Hurzeler said. \u201cIn the end, that\u2019s where we want to go, that\u2019s the ambition from the club. \u201cThat\u2019s our responsibility to show it individually and also as a group if we are ready or not.\u201d Brighton are sixth in the league and could go as high as third if they do cause a seismic shock. We\u2019ve been chatting a bit about Manchester United and what the plan is with their interim boss, Ruud van Nistelrooy. Chants of \u201cRuuuuuuuud\u201d filled Old Trafford this week, just they did when he was banging in goals across a five-year spell at the club. The big man wants to help. But will be be around come the end of the season? Will Unwin seeks out an answer: He\u2019s been known to throw his toys and spew at fourth officials, but Mikel Arteta has promised to be more zen on the touchline. \u201cI don\u2019t want to miss any games, that is for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot promise you that if we score a goal I am not going to be jumping up and down the touchline. I cannot guarantee that. Hopefully as well they [the match officials] have adapted and they have understood that emotions are a big part of that. I cannot control myself in the scoreline and so far it has worked.\u201d I guess we\u2019ll have to wait and see, won\u2019t we? Is Chelsea simply Palmer plus 10? Yes, says Krishna Moorthy: \u201cGood afternoon Daniel Am a Chelsea fan (no jokes please) and since when beating Man United has become a yardstick for calling a team good? I know we have better this year but we are now Cole Palmer ft Chelsea and we crumble faster than a in flight croissant\u201d It\u2019s bad news for the champions. Pep Guardiola has said that he has only 13 fit players to choose from after two more went down in the 2-1 defeat to Tottenham in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday. Already without six first choice players, Pep lost both Manuel Akanji (calf) and Savinho (ankle). Ruben Dias, who was repalced at half time, was also said to be \u201cstruggling\u201d Rodri, officially the best player in the world, is out for the season. Kevin du Bruyne, who is out with a thigh injury, does not have a return date. Nor does Kyle Walker, Jeremy Doku or Jack Grealish. Attacking midfielder Oscar Bobb is also out with a fractured leg and could be back after \u201cthree or four months\u201d. \u201cTomorrow we have two goalkeepers and Erling Haaland in the training session,\u201d Guardiola said after the Tottenham defeat. \u201cThe rest, we don\u2019t have anything else.\u201d What to do with interim managers who turn this around? That\u2019s a question the Manchester United overlords might have to answer, and one posed by Rick Harris below: Hi Daniel, Manchester United look very close to finalising the Amorim deal with Sporting unless there is an 11th hour hitch and it falls apart, but three games for Ruud Van Nistelrooy to manage the team before the new Portuguese sensation or \u2018special one\u2019 takes over could be a tad embarrassing if the team were to win all three in convincing dominant style. Of course they were there before with Ole Solskjaer who had a massive new manager bounce that had pundits screaming for him to get the permanent gig only for the balloon to deflate the instant he signed a three year contract. Unlikely that Amorim will want Ruud to hang around but it may make the appointment look a little rushed if United suddenly improve massively now Ten Hag has gone. Two intersting points. The Ole situation probably means that Ruud could win the Champions League and the suits would still give him the axe. Secondly, I fear you\u2019re right. Amorim might want his own support team which could be bad news for any of the current coaches. Our pal Krishna Moorthy has made my job a whole lot easier by posing some teasing questions: - will Amorim have any sense and avoid the quicksand that is OT - will anything come out of all the protest(!) around WC 2034 to Saudi \u201chuman rights\u201d Arabia? - Should The awards given to the team and manager of RM be announced null and void , a reverse tantrum, so to say? - should there be a new award announced, named, the most entertaining manager in post match pressers , and given away to JM till he retires - and Chelsea, where can I even begin, sigh! I\u2019ll take a crack at all of them: No. The deal is as good as done as far as I can tell. No. If it didn\u2019t work with Qatar it\u2019s not going to work with the Saudis. I\u2019d love it if RM had their accolades stripped from them. That\u2019d teach \u2018em! Surely we\u2019d name it after Marcelo Bielsa? To be fair, they\u2019re looking pretty good (Wednesday\u2019s result aside). I fully expect them to beat United this weekend. Planning on buying a ticket from a tout this weekend? Don\u2019t do it! They might be fakes. Liverpool have revealed they shut down 100,000 fake ticketing accounts and issued 75 lifetime bans and 136 indefinite suspensions last season as part of a crackdown on ticket touting. Too right, if you ask me. Nothing grinds my gears as much as fans getting shafted at the turnstile. Last year, at the Rugby World Cup final, friends of mine, who had spent around a thousand pounds in travel costs, accommodation in Paris as well as babysitters for the weekend, were denied just as they had their tickets scanned at the gate. I still yearn for justice on their behalf. \u201cWhat is it with England and captains?\u201d Well, Magnus Evander, I\u2019m South African, but I take your point. I did say that Trent Alexander-Arnold is perhaps indispensable because of his leadership potential. But no, he shouldn\u2019t stay just because he may be captain one day. I also think he\u2019s an outstanding footballer and Liverpool would do well to keep him at the club. But, as you say, this apparent obsession with captains probably stems from elsewhere: \u201cIt must be the cricket. In other countries it is not as important in football. Of course one should select a good captain, but its not such a big deal.\u201d The good news for Newcastle is that this little period will be one of the toughest they\u2019ll have to navigate. Last week they were at Stamford Bridge and lost 2-1. This weekend they host Arsenal. What does Howe make of the Gunners? \u201cThey are a very good team with a very good manager. We play one of the most consistent teams in the Premier League for the last couple of years so the challenge for us is never easy, but we\u2019re at home. \u201cArsenal have done very well this season; they are very good from set-plays and a physical team. We need to be ready for that test.\u201d History is on Newcastle\u2019s side. They\u2019ve won two of their last three home games against Arsenal. What\u2019s more, Mikel Arteta\u2019s lads are leaking goals. They\u2019ve conceded nine in their last five league game and two or more in four of those five. Are they there for the taking? Back to Eddie Howe and Newcastle. The Magpies are sweating over the fitness of two of their best players \u2013 Anthony Gordan and Alexander Isak: \u201cThey both feel OK,\u201d Howe said. We will assess how they feel today. Sometimes 48 hours after the game you can feel different to 24 hours. It\u2019s not necessarily a straight line with how the body feels. They have both had niggling injuries so we\u2019ll make a decision today. \u201cThere\u2019s just general fatigue [across the squad], game fatigue. I think it was a good physical game against Chelsea - both on the Sunday [in the Premier League] and the Wednesday [in the Carabao Cup]. They were intense matches. \u201cNormal game fatigue you get 24 hours after a game and 48 hours, so we need to make sure that whoever enters the pitch against Arsenal is in their best condition.\u201d There\u2019s a scandal brewing in the Caribbean. No, it\u2019s not England\u2019s cricketers stinking up the islands, but something far more serious: It\u2019s nice to see Eddie Howe smile again. It\u2019s been a tough few months for the Newcastle boss and Wednesday\u2019s 2-0 win over Chelsea in the Carabao Cup lifted some tension from his slumped shoulders. \u201cIt has been important, for a while here,\u201d he said of the vibe at St James\u2019. The environment again was second to none. It was a sell out, it was a really good feeling. I can\u2019t thank the supporters enough for that. There was no hangover from recent results, it was really good and that helped us massively. He also added that a large squad fill with talented players helps. Have we stopped caring about how they\u2019re funded? Anyway\u2026 \u201cThey certainly give you the ability to change the team. Many times I\u2019ve said I don\u2019t want the team to pick itself, but I also don\u2019t want to go game to game, changing too many players, because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s healthy either. \u201cSo I believe in a settled team, but of course, with midweek fixtures especially, the intensity of games now, you have to have the ability to rotate. I\u2019ll pick the strongest team that I can, that can give us the best chance to win.\u201d Trent to go? And breathe, Liverpool fans. That\u2019s just John Potter answering my question on who is the least valuable of the three \u2018Pool players running out their contracts: TAA, Virgil or Mo? \u201cTAA is out the door already to RM I believe,\u201d says John. \u201cHe publicly stated he wants to won\u2019t the Balon d\u2019Or, and we all know playing for them it\u2019s pretty much nailed on for him.....oh.\u201d I see what you did there. Three Liverpool players are out of contract at the end of the season and they\u2019re big names. Mo Salaha, Virgil van Dyk and Trent Alexander-Arnold are all in talks about extensions, but will they all stay? \u201cThe contract situation could become an issue if the players don\u2019t perform as they do at the moment, but they are so mature. At the moment all three of them are in a good place and there are ongoing discussions, like Virgil has said. They are not with me, we talk about other things. \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see but all that he says is completely right. He doesn\u2019t know exactly what the future holds if he doesn\u2019t sign the contract.\u201d Let\u2019s play a game, Liverpool fans. If you had to lose only one of them, who would it be? Van Dyk is probably the most important player in the team, but then Salah remains the most threatening moving forward. But Trent is the youngest and a potential future captain. Is there a dilemma at left back for Liverpool? No, there isn\u2019t. But that\u2019s how we have to talk about selection decisions in football. Arne Slot, who now has options with Kostas Tsimikas challenging Andy Robertson for a starting berth, wasn\u2019t having it either: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t it\u2019s say a dilemma. There are other positions where we have rotated. \u201cIt probably also has to do with Robbo\u2019s pre-season. He had no pre-season because he came back injured from the Euros so he missed almost the whole pre-season. For most of them it was only two weeks but for him it was only a few days. \u201cKostas did really well in that period of time so it has to do with the quality Kostas has in that position but it also has to do with Robbo missing pre-season. That\u2019s why we started rotating from the start a bit. That\u2019s the situation. \u201cIt was good for Robbo to play against Arsenal and against Brighton in midweek. That is making sure he is getting into that rhythm of playing twice a week.\u201d Liverpool will have to find a way to beat Brighton without their first-choice keeper, and will likely have to do so again when they host Aston Villa next week. So said Arne Slot, who added that it was \u201cdifficult to put an exact time frame\u201d on the return of Alisson. The same applies for Diogo Jota and Federico Chiesa. But that means there\u2019s a chance for other players to become heroes and Slot took some time to shine a light on Alexis Mac Allister. \u201cHe\u2019s a player I would play in all three positions in the midfield because he is so comfortable in all three. \u201cI saw a lot of him at Brighton because there was a manager I was quite interested in back then [Roberto de Zerbi]. \u201cHe is now at the moment the midfielder who plays a bit in between. Ryan [Gravenberch] is almost always the deepest. Dom [Szoboszlai] or Curtis [Jones] are playing a bit higher and then Alexis is in between. \u201cIt depends on how dominant we are whether he is the second 10 or the second six. He is comfortable in both phases of the game. He can help us bring the ball out from the back and he is also capable of making the difference in and around the 18-yard box. We want to see him in both situations as much as we can.\u201d Arteta was the joint leader for Premier League manager yellow cards in 2023/24 but he promises he\u2019s turned a new leaf. \u201cOn the touchline, I haven\u2019t got to the point I go into meditating mode. Maybe I should. When they change the rules about certain behaviours, we need to adapt and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried to do. \u201cI don\u2019t want to miss any games. I can\u2019t promise that if we score a goal, I won\u2019t jump up and down the touchline. So far, it has worked.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s rare to see a talent like that at 17 years old\u201d High praise indeed from Mikel Arteta who was gushing about his young starlet, Ethan Nwaneri, who scored a goal in Arsenal\u2019s EFL Cup win at Preston this week. \u201cI can talk about how good he is right now. At 17, to be in the position he is in at one of the biggest clubs in Europe sums up where he is. He is surrounded by the right people. My prediction is going to be very positive. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do it [select him] because it was a gift, we saw a path for him and wanted to show the trust in him. \u201cI think the biggest thing is to push him. Once you push, grab him from behind. When you see this talent, you have to push him. He has to see he can fly and not cut his wings. \u201cThat shows in the building that there is a pathway and for other players to follow.\u201d While it\u2019s bad news for Riccardo Calafiori and Martin Odegaard, Mikel Arteta confirmed that Gabriel could make a return to the side if he navigate today\u2019s training session without a hitch. \u201cWe have a training session today, if he can complete that, he will be available,\u201d Arsenal\u2019s manager said. However, Calafiori and Odegaard are \u201cdefinitely out\u201d and Ben White\u2019s status is now \u201cwait and see\u201d. \u201cThat is Ben\u2019s quality, he can play two different positions\u201d Arteta said of White, adding that his current injury is not a recurrence of his gammy groin and more related to a joint issue.. \u201cHe can adapt. We are demanding. For him to do that job, having not played there for over a year, was very impressive.\u201d Elsewhere, Takehiro Tomiyasu is also out and won\u2019t be back before the next international break. Mikel Arteta is the first PL boss to speak to the press this morning. He started by sending his thoughts to those impacted by the horrific floods that have already claimed more than 150 lives in Spain. \u201cWe are trying to pull together in this situation. We ask everyone to pull together and show their support. It is terrible what has happened,\u201d Arteta said. In a wide-ranging interview, his first with a newspaper since departing from his director of football role, Nils Nielsen covers a lot of ground with Tom Garry. The world\u2019s oldest cup competition, one stretching back all the way to 1871, gets going today. Well, OK, we\u2019ve already had four qualifying rounds, but today marks the official start of the first round of the FA Cup. There are loads of games this weekend \u2013 too many to list in full here \u2013 but I will wish supporters of Notts County, Alfreton Town, Tamworth and Huddersfield the best of luck for this evening. Notts County currently sit third in League Two and welcome Alfreton Town who occupy seventh spot in the National League North standings. Huddersfield, who last played in the Premier League in 2019, are seventh in League One and make the trip to Tamworth who\u2019d do well to upset the Terriers given that they\u2019re down in 16th in the National League table. Any of our readers going to these games? Anyone else heading off to an FA Cup game? Holla! As always, we kick off our Friday fare with the 10 things to look out for this Premier League weekend. Louise Taylor says its time for Tonali to take charge at a Newcastle outfit that could do with some leadership. Andy Hunter shines a light on Arne Slot\u2019s selection headaches. And Will Unwin wonders if Manchester United\u2019s midfield has enough oomph with Manuel Ugarte kicking lumps out of the opposition in those central areas. Can we keep Cole Palmer quiet? Premier League fixtures this weekend: Newcastle v Arsenal (12:30 Saturday) Liverpool v Brighton (15:00 Saturday) Ipswich v Leicester (15:00 Saturday) Bournemouth v Man City (15:00 Saturday) Southampton v Everton (15:00 Saturday) Nott\u2019m Forest v West Ham (15:00 Saturday) Wolves v Crystal Palace (17:30 Saturday) Tottenham v Aston Villa (14:00 Sunday) Man United v Chelsea (16:30 Sunday) Fulham v Brentford (20:00 Saturday) What a week of football that was. Rodri and Aitana Bonmati won golden balls. Real Madrid threw a tantrum. Manchester United sacked their manager, put five past Leicester with their interim boss and confirmed the signing of another. We\u2019ll pick at the bones of a mad few days and look ahead at the action taking place this weekend. Can\u2019t stop, won\u2019t stop! As always, your thoughts and quips are welcome. Drop me a line and let\u2019s have some fun together. I especially want to hear from United and Madrid fans so please, if you\u2019re in the sharing mood, get in touch!",

The gesture is believed to have its origins in an ancient pagan ritual offering to the water gods.",

Thank you for reading it and for the comments below the line today. You can keep up to date with the Guardian\u2019s UK politics reporting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics\">here</a>.</p> <p>Here is a summary of the latest developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>The budget\u2019s \u201cclean bill of health\u201d with fiscal watchdogs should give investors confidence in Labour\u2019s plans, Rachel Reeves has said amid market fluctuations. </strong>Asked about post-budget market movements on a visit to Newcastle, the chancellor told broadcasters: \u201cI won\u2019t comment on market moves, because markets move all the time. What I am confirming is that the International Monetary Fund has given our budget a clean bill of health and the Office for Budget Responsibility have confirmed that we meet our fiscal rules two years early. That should give confidence to investors that we have a plan to secure our public finances after the instability and chaos of the last few years.\u201d</p></li> <li><p><strong>Reeves has been warned an extra \u00a39bn of tax rises may be required to avoid a fresh austerity drive in key public services as her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/rachel-reeves-bets-on-public-spending-increases-in-budget-winning-over-voters\">record tax-raising budget</a> sent tremors through the financial markets. </strong>Threatening to undermine the chancellor\u2019s claim that her budget would restore economic stability to Britain, government borrowing costs rose sharply in the City on Thursday as traders turned on Reeves\u2019s tax and spending measures.</p></li> <li><p><strong>City traders warned the higher short-term borrowing levels set out in the budget threatened to derail the Bank of England from pushing ahead with a deep round of interest rate cuts.</strong> The pound also fell against the US dollar to its lowest for two months.</p></li> <li><p><strong>However, the Bank of England is expected to cut interest rates next week, despite forecasts that Labour\u2019s autumn budget could lead to higher inflation over the coming year.</strong> Policymakers will announce the result of their November meeting on Thursday, where most analysts think they will trim the base rate by a quarter-point to 4.75%.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The UK is in a \u201cvery different world\u201d compared with the turmoil which followed Liz Truss\u2019s economic plans, a minister said on Friday as the government seeked to quell post-budget market jitters.</strong> Darren Jones, Reeves\u2019s deputy at the Treasury, told Sky News that \u201cmarkets always respond to budgets in the normal way\u201d. \u201cI think we\u2019ve all got PTSD from Liz Truss,\u201d he added.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Jones also defended the government paying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/31/head-of-governments-new-value-for-money-office-to-be-paid-950-a-day\">\u00a3950 a day to a new value for money chair David Goldstone.</a> </strong>Asked by LBC about Goldstone\u2019s salary as the head of the Office for Value for Money (OVFM), Jones said: \u201cIt is right that we pay people for their time. We can\u2019t expect people to work for free. That is an important way in which we do things in this country. Actually, the day rate for David is, on a benchmark basis, competitive.\u201d</p></li> <li><p><strong>Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, has raised concerns over the budget creating a \u201clost generation\u201d of farmers.</strong> His comments came as he visited an agricultural college in Maidenhead on Friday. Davey said: \u201cThe government is at risk of creating a lost generation of farmers. Young people will lose the opportunity to keep the farms their families have run for generations, while at the same time they are seeing government support for farming slashed.\u201d</p></li> <li><p><strong>The president of the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) has said he is \u201cabsolutely baffled\u201d at the government\u2019s decision to \u201cdouble down\u201d on inheritance tax on farms. </strong>Tom Bradshaw, who is meeting environment secretary, Steve Reed, on Monday, said the current plans to change agricultural property relief (APR) and business property relief (BPR) \u201cneed to be overturned and fast\u201d. In an interview with the PA news agency, Bradshaw spoke of \u201ctension\u201d, \u201canger\u201d and \u201cfrustration\u201d among farming communities.</p></li> <li><p><strong>In a piece for The Daily Telegraph on Friday, Reed said he \u201cunderstood farmers\u2019 anxiety at any changes\u201d but that changes to inheritance tax on farms would \u201cmake the system fairer\u201d.</strong> He added: \u201cOnly the richest estates will be asked to pay, not small, family farms as some misleading headlines have claimed. Look at the detail and you\u2019ll see that the vast majority of farmers will not be affected at all. They will be able to pass the family farm down to their children just as previous generations have always done.\u201d</p></li> <li><p><strong>Reeves has been warned that her number one mission to boost Britain\u2019s economy is at risk amid fresh evidence that the budget has damaged business confidence. </strong>In a snap poll of more than 700 members of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/institute-of-directors\">Institute of Directors</a>, the lobby group said two-thirds felt negatively about the budget and thought that it would not support the government\u2019s growth mission.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The rating agency Moody\u2019s said the budget would do little to improve Britain\u2019s economic growth</strong>, and said Reeves\u2019s plans to add to government borrowing in the near-term would pose an \u201cadditional challenge\u201d to repairing the public finances.</p></li> </ul>    <ul> <li><p><strong>GP surgeries are not eligible for compensation, the government has confirmed in reference to a PA news agency report that suggested</strong> <strong>No 10 had hinted that GP surgeries could get help with NICs. </strong>The quotes from a No 10 spokesperson were not intended as a hint that extra NICs compensation was coming, government sources have indicated.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Independent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/schools\">Schools</a> Council (ISC) has said it will launch legal action against the government\u2019s decision to impose VAT on independent school fees. </strong>The council, which represents more than 1,400 private schools in the UK and abroad, reached its decision after a board meeting held on Thursday.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Downing Street is confident changes to inheritance tax on farms will not impact food security and said there was adequate financial support available to farmers. </strong>A No 10 spokesperson said the government\u2019s message was \u201cclear that we are committed to supporting farmers\u201d, adding: \u201cIt is expected that almost three-quarters of estates are expected to be unaffected by this.\u201d</p></li> <li><p><strong>An EU citizen caught up in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/home-office\">Home Office</a> backlog of applications for post-Brexit residency status has been forcibly removed from the UK. </strong>Costa Koushiappis, 39, a Greek Cypriot, was put onboard a plane to Amsterdam with only three days\u2019 notice.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Planned strikes by London Underground workers in the RMT have been suspended, the union announced. </strong>Workers were due to take action on Friday evening and on several days in the coming weeks in a dispute over pay. The RMT said it had received an improved pay offer. Strikes by members of the drivers\u2019 union Aslef next week and later in the month are still scheduled to go ahead.</p></li> <li><p><strong>GP surgeries will have to consider making staff redundant if the rise in employer national insurance contributions announced in the budget is not covered</strong>, <strong>the government has been told.</strong> Helen Morgan, health and social care spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, added: \u201cWe are urging the chancellor to change course and exempt GPs from a tax hike.\u201d</p></li> <li><p><strong>A care group has called on the government to exempt social care providers from the tax rise or ringfence funding to cover it. </strong>Independent Care Group (ICG) chair Mike Padgham said: \u201cThe government has to do something and it has to do it quickly, as I am already hearing from providers that this might be the last straw for some of them.\u201d</p></li> <li><p><strong>Scottish councils say they must receive their fair share of new funds from the UK budget, as they called for \u201csustainable investment\u201d in local authorities</strong>. Council umbrella body Cosla has written to the Scottish and UK governments seeking clarity on the funding arrangements, after Reeves said the Scottish government is now in line to receive \u00a347.7bn in the next financial year.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The growth in UK house prices slowed unexpectedly last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nationwide\">Nationwide</a> said, as it warned buyers to expect a rush in transactions early next year sparked by changes to stamp duty rules in the budget. </strong>Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, warned that the chancellor\u2019s decision to remove the temporary increase to the nil rate for stamp duty next April could spark a rush to complete purchases before the changes.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ryanair could cut flights to and from UK airports by 10% next year after Labour\u2019s decision to increase the tax on airline tickets in the autumn budget</strong>. The airline\u2019s chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, criticised the spending statement on Friday, saying it has \u201cdamaged\u201d UK growth prospects and \u201cmade air travel much more expensive\u201d. Reeves said air passenger duty (APD) will rise from the 2026/27 financial year, adding up to \u00a32 to the cost of an economy ticket for a short-haul flight.</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-01T16:50:00.993Z\">at 4.50pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6724fcb28f08b3d97c363664\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-01T16:38:56.662Z\">4.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Responding to the news that government sources have indicated that GP surgeries will not be eligible for compensation from the government\u2019s employers NICs rise (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/01/markets-labour-budget-treasury-rachel-reeves-uk-politics-latest-updates?page=with:block-6724d6ba8f086f851f570d53#block-6724d6ba8f086f851f570d53\">see 1.36pm GMT</a>), <strong>Liberal Democrat</strong> Treasury spokesperson, <strong>Daisy Cooper</strong> said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government must scrap this GP penalty immediately.<br><br>After years of the Conservatives disgraceful neglect, our primary care services are in crisis and this could push many to reduce the number of staff they employ or just decide to shut up shop. <br><br>Instead of investing in our GPs and their staff, the government has put more pressure on them in a move that will make it even harder for patients to see a GP when they need to.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6725004b8f080a1fc5f9483b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-01T16:24:05.161Z\">4.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>Bank of England</strong> is expected to cut interest rates next week, despite forecasts that Labour\u2019s autumn budget could lead to higher inflation over the coming year, reports the PA news agency. </p> <p>Policymakers will announce the result of their November meeting on Thursday, where most analysts think they will trim the base rate by a quarter-point to 4.75%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6724f6128f080a1fc5f94746\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-01T15:47:08.183Z\">3.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The president of the <strong>National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU)</strong> has said he is \u201cabsolutely baffled\u201d at the government\u2019s decision to \u201cdouble down\u201d on inheritance tax on farms. </p> <p><strong>Tom Bradshaw</strong>, who is meeting environment secretary, <strong>Steve Reed</strong>, on Monday, said the current plans to change <strong>agricultural property relief (APR)</strong> and <strong>business property relief (BPR)</strong> \u201cneed to be overturned and fast\u201d. </p> <p>Speaking to the PA news agency, Bradshaw spoke of \u201ctension\u201d, \u201canger\u201d and \u201cfrustration\u201d among farming communities.

We will work with the government to find a resolution, but I just hope that resolution is forthcoming.</p> <p>I just think that what our members are saying to us is this is a government that doesn\u2019t understand farming. </p> <p>They\u2019ve shown us with this budget they just don\u2019t understand what we do to produce the country\u2019s food.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>He said farmers are deemed to be wealthy because they have an asset, but pointed out that the return from that asset is \u201cvery, very low\u201d. </p> <p>Bradshaw added: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think there\u2019s a real anger in the countryside that this government is demonstrating that they don\u2019t understand the farming industry. </p> <p>I was so pleased when I saw the Labour manifesto. Those words \u2018Food security is national security\u2019 are so important, but those words don\u2019t feed people. It\u2019s the family farms across the United Kingdom that produce people\u2019s food and are going to be adversely impacted by this change.</p> <p>And I really hope that the government can see that they\u2019ve got this wrong.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>The NFU said Britain\u2019s farmers and growers will take part in a mass lobby of their MPs over the plans on 19 November and Bradshaw said it is already \u201cmassively oversubscribed\u201d. </p> <p>While Reed referred to \u201cmisleading\u201d headlines, the NFU has used the same word to describe Treasury figures, according to the PA news agency. Bradshaw said he does not understand the Treasury\u2019s figures, adding: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At a time of huge turmoil in the industry, with all the changes since Brexit, since Covid and the Ukrainian crisis, and all the inflation, to bring this change in now, especially when the secretary of state has talked publicly about understanding the pressures on the industry, the mental health challenges that the industry is facing, and then they brought this change in.

Scottish Labour says the budget will lead to a further investment of \u00a31.4bn in a number of local projects over the next decade. These include town plans, levelling up money and green freeports. </p> <p>Cosla resources spokesperson, <strong>Katie Hagmann</strong>, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Following the UK budget announcement, I have written today to both UK government and Scottish government seeking assurance that local government in Scotland and the communities we serve will receive our fair share of the additional funds announced in the UK budget. </p> <p>Scottish local government has seen significant cuts to our core settlement over time, and we hope that moving into 2025/26 we can begin to reverse these cuts and ensure that there is sustainable investment in local public services. </p> <p>We have sought assurances from the UK government around some areas, including the increase to employer national insurance contributions which will not only have a detrimental impact on councils as employers, but also on the many partner organisations who deliver vital services across our communities, for example social care and children\u2019s services. </p> <p>We will continue to work with both UK government and Scottish government to minimise any detriment to our communities and their local services.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>Commenting on the funding for local projects, Scottish Labour economy spokesperson <strong>Daniel Johnson</strong> said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As well as delivering the largest block grant in the history of devolution to the Scottish parliament, the Labour Government is investing another \u00a31.4bn directly in Scotland\u2019s future. This will help to renew infrastructure and promote growth the length and breadth of Scotland. </p> <p>Labour\u2019s direct investment in these projects will strengthen local communities and economies \u2013 but we need a government with ambition in Holyrood too.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>According to the PA news agency, a spokesperson for the Scottish government said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are assessing the full implications of the chancellor\u2019s autumn budget statement. Finance secretary Shona Robison will be announcing further details as part of the Scottish budget on 4 December. </p> <p>We recognise the crucial role councils play in their communities. That is why we are making available record funding of more than \u00a314bn to councils in 2024-25 and our commitment to meaningful budget engagement with Cosla will continue ahead of the Scottish budget.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>A spokesperson for the UK government said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Funding for local government is a responsibility devolved to the Scottish government and the autumn budget provided it with a record \u00a347.7bn settlement \u2013 the largest in real terms in the history of devolution. </p> <p>Given the impacts of changes to employer national insurance contributions are complex, this settlement does not reflect this additional support the chancellor is providing for the public sector. </p> <p>We are working through the budget implications with the Scottish government.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6724eaf08f082872090d0eb2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/richard-partington\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-01T14:53:38.642Z\">2.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Two-thirds of bosses feel negatively about budget, Reeves is told</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Rachel Reeves</strong> has been warned that her number one mission to boost Britain\u2019s economy is at risk amid fresh evidence that the budget has damaged business confidence after tremors in the financial markets.</p> <p>With the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/31/ifs-says-extra-9bn-of-tax-rises-may-be-needed-to-avoid-uk-public-service-cuts\">government under pressure</a> to defend its tax and spending plans, business leaders said the chancellor had failed to halt a rapid deterioration in sentiment among company bosses ahead of the budget, with damaging consequences for their investment intentions.</p>    <p>In a snap poll of more than 700 members of the <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/institute-of-directors\">Institute of Directors</a></strong>, the lobby group said two-thirds felt negatively about the budget and thought that it would not support the government\u2019s growth mission.</p> <p><strong>Roger Barker</strong>, the director of policy at the Institute of Directors, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even before the chancellor had risen to deliver her budget speech, the confidence of business leaders had hit its lowest level since December 2022.

He was taken to <strong>Belmarsh high-security prison</strong> in south-east London.</p> <p>The jailing of Robinson is the latest episode in his apparently inexorable rise from the owner of a tanning salon in <strong>Luton</strong>, <strong>Bedfordshire</strong>, to the brash pin-up hero of the far right in the UK, the US and beyond. He is, arguably, the most potent individual to have emerged on the British far right since <strong>Enoch Powell</strong>.</p> <p>Along the way, he has served four jail terms, and has now begun his fifth. None appear to have led him to reflect on and reconsider his actions; indeed, they have reinforced his image as a political martyr to the cause of rightwing extremism.</p> <p>Robinson is a complex and often contradictory figure, but \u201cwe should not underestimate him\u201d, said <strong>Nick Lowles</strong>, the chief executive of the anti-racism campaign group <strong><a href=\"https://hopenothate.org.uk/\">Hope Not Hate</a></strong>, who has watched him closely for years.</p> <p>He is \u201cmassively charismatic\u201d with \u201cenormous reach\u201d, said Lowles. \u201cHe has an ability to bring huge crowds together on a level that we haven\u2019t seen previously.

After years of being taken for granted by the Conservative party, rural communities should have been properly supported in this budget.</p> <p>The chancellor now needs to listen to rural communities, reverse these measures and ensure the next generation of farmers is protected.</p> <p>Liberal Democrats backed British farmers by demanding an extra \u00a31bn to support them during the election, and we\u2019ll keep being a strong voice for our rural communities.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-01T12:58:05.936Z\">at 12.58pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6724cc078f086f851f570cc3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-01T12:42:49.450Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Downing Street</strong> is confident changes to inheritance tax on farms will not impact food security and said there was adequate financial support available to farmers, reports the PA news agency.</p> <p>Asked if ministers were confident the changes will not hurt food security, a No 10 spokesperson said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yes.

rules in the budget.</p> <p>The building society\u2019s monthly index showed that annual house prices grew at a rate of 2.4% in October, a slowdown from the near two-year high of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/sep/30/uk-house-prices-hit-highest-annual-growth-since-2022\">3.2% recorded in September</a>.</p> <p>This was still the third highest rate of annual growth since December 2022, but was lower than experts had forecast, with a Reuters poll of economists predicting a 2.8% increase for the month.</p> <p>The average house in the UK cost \u00a3265,738 in October, a 0.1% increase from September. <strong>Robert Gardner</strong>, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said market activity remained resilient, with mortgage approvals approaching pre-pandemic levels, despite a significantly higher interest rate environment.</p> <p>However, he warned that the chancellor\u2019s decision to remove the temporary increase to the nil rate for stamp duty next April could spark a rush to complete purchases before the changes.</p> <p>In September 2022, the government temporarily increased the nil rate of stamp duty, the amount before you have to start paying stamp duty on a purchase, for homebuyers, raising the nil rate for first-time buyers from \u00a3300,000 to \u00a3450,000, and for those buying an additional home from \u00a3125,000 to

from 31 March next year.</p> <p>Gardner said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The main impact of the stamp duty changes is likely to be on the timing of property transactions, as purchasers aim to ensure their house purchases complete before the tax change takes effect.</p> <p>This will lead to a jump in transactions in the first three months of 2025 (especially March), and a corresponding period of weakness in the following three to six months, as occurred in the wake of previous stamp duty changes.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\">

There have also been concerns about the impact on GP surgeries, with one practice manager suggesting it could cost his practice about \u00a340,000 a year.</p> <p><strong>Dr Jess Harvey</strong>, a GP based in Shropshire, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that practices will \u201creally struggle\u201d.

Here is a summary of the latest developments: The budget\u2019s \u201cclean bill of health\u201d with fiscal watchdogs should give investors confidence in Labour\u2019s plans, Rachel Reeves has said amid market fluctuations. Asked about post-budget market movements on a visit to Newcastle, the chancellor told broadcasters: \u201cI won\u2019t comment on market moves, because markets move all the time. What I am confirming is that the International Monetary Fund has given our budget a clean bill of health and the Office for Budget Responsibility have confirmed that we meet our fiscal rules two years early. That should give confidence to investors that we have a plan to secure our public finances after the instability and chaos of the last few years.\u201d Reeves has been warned an extra \u00a39bn of tax rises may be required to avoid a fresh austerity drive in key public services as her record tax-raising budget sent tremors through the financial markets. Threatening to undermine the chancellor\u2019s claim that her budget would restore economic stability to Britain, government borrowing costs rose sharply in the City on Thursday as traders turned on Reeves\u2019s tax and spending measures. City traders warned the higher short-term borrowing levels set out in the budget threatened to derail the Bank of England from pushing ahead with a deep round of interest rate cuts. The pound also fell against the US dollar to its lowest for two months. However, the Bank of England is expected to cut interest rates next week, despite forecasts that Labour\u2019s autumn budget could lead to higher inflation over the coming year. Policymakers will announce the result of their November meeting on Thursday, where most analysts think they will trim the base rate by a quarter-point to 4.75%. The UK is in a \u201cvery different world\u201d compared with the turmoil which followed Liz Truss\u2019s economic plans, a minister said on Friday as the government seeked to quell post-budget market jitters. Darren Jones, Reeves\u2019s deputy at the Treasury, told Sky News that \u201cmarkets always respond to budgets in the normal way\u201d. \u201cI think we\u2019ve all got PTSD from Liz Truss,\u201d he added. Jones also defended the government paying \u00a3950 a day to a new value for money chair David Goldstone. Asked by LBC about Goldstone\u2019s salary as the head of the Office for Value for Money (OVFM), Jones said: \u201cIt is right that we pay people for their time. We can\u2019t expect people to work for free. That is an important way in which we do things in this country. Actually, the day rate for David is, on a benchmark basis, competitive.\u201d Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, has raised concerns over the budget creating a \u201clost generation\u201d of farmers. His comments came as he visited an agricultural college in Maidenhead on Friday. Davey said: \u201cThe government is at risk of creating a lost generation of farmers. Young people will lose the opportunity to keep the farms their families have run for generations, while at the same time they are seeing government support for farming slashed.\u201d The president of the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) has said he is \u201cabsolutely baffled\u201d at the government\u2019s decision to \u201cdouble down\u201d on inheritance tax on farms. Tom Bradshaw, who is meeting environment secretary, Steve Reed, on Monday, said the current plans to change agricultural property relief (APR) and business property relief (BPR) \u201cneed to be overturned and fast\u201d. In an interview with the PA news agency, Bradshaw spoke of \u201ctension\u201d, \u201canger\u201d and \u201cfrustration\u201d among farming communities. In a piece for The Daily Telegraph on Friday, Reed said he \u201cunderstood farmers\u2019 anxiety at any changes\u201d but that changes to inheritance tax on farms would \u201cmake the system fairer\u201d. He added: \u201cOnly the richest estates will be asked to pay, not small, family farms as some misleading headlines have claimed. Look at the detail and you\u2019ll see that the vast majority of farmers will not be affected at all. They will be able to pass the family farm down to their children just as previous generations have always done.\u201d Reeves has been warned that her number one mission to boost Britain\u2019s economy is at risk amid fresh evidence that the budget has damaged business confidence. In a snap poll of more than 700 members of the Institute of Directors, the lobby group said two-thirds felt negatively about the budget and thought that it would not support the government\u2019s growth mission. The rating agency Moody\u2019s said the budget would do little to improve Britain\u2019s economic growth, and said Reeves\u2019s plans to add to government borrowing in the near-term would pose an \u201cadditional challenge\u201d to repairing the public finances. GP surgeries are not eligible for compensation, the government has confirmed in reference to a PA news agency report that suggested No 10 had hinted that GP surgeries could get help with NICs. The quotes from a No 10 spokesperson were not intended as a hint that extra NICs compensation was coming, government sources have indicated. The Independent Schools Council (ISC) has said it will launch legal action against the government\u2019s decision to impose VAT on independent school fees. The council, which represents more than 1,400 private schools in the UK and abroad, reached its decision after a board meeting held on Thursday. Downing Street is confident changes to inheritance tax on farms will not impact food security and said there was adequate financial support available to farmers. A No 10 spokesperson said the government\u2019s message was \u201cclear that we are committed to supporting farmers\u201d, adding: \u201cIt is expected that almost three-quarters of estates are expected to be unaffected by this.\u201d An EU citizen caught up in a Home Office backlog of applications for post-Brexit residency status has been forcibly removed from the UK. Costa Koushiappis, 39, a Greek Cypriot, was put onboard a plane to Amsterdam with only three days\u2019 notice. Planned strikes by London Underground workers in the RMT have been suspended, the union announced. Workers were due to take action on Friday evening and on several days in the coming weeks in a dispute over pay. The RMT said it had received an improved pay offer. Strikes by members of the drivers\u2019 union Aslef next week and later in the month are still scheduled to go ahead. GP surgeries will have to consider making staff redundant if the rise in employer national insurance contributions announced in the budget is not covered, the government has been told. Helen Morgan, health and social care spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, added: \u201cWe are urging the chancellor to change course and exempt GPs from a tax hike.\u201d A care group has called on the government to exempt social care providers from the tax rise or ringfence funding to cover it. Independent Care Group (ICG) chair Mike Padgham said: \u201cThe government has to do something and it has to do it quickly, as I am already hearing from providers that this might be the last straw for some of them.\u201d Scottish councils say they must receive their fair share of new funds from the UK budget, as they called for \u201csustainable investment\u201d in local authorities. Council umbrella body Cosla has written to the Scottish and UK governments seeking clarity on the funding arrangements, after Reeves said the Scottish government is now in line to receive \u00a347.7bn in the next financial year. The growth in UK house prices slowed unexpectedly last month, Nationwide said, as it warned buyers to expect a rush in transactions early next year sparked by changes to stamp duty rules in the budget. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, warned that the chancellor\u2019s decision to remove the temporary increase to the nil rate for stamp duty next April could spark a rush to complete purchases before the changes. Ryanair could cut flights to and from UK airports by 10% next year after Labour\u2019s decision to increase the tax on airline tickets in the autumn budget. The airline\u2019s chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, criticised the spending statement on Friday, saying it has \u201cdamaged\u201d UK growth prospects and \u201cmade air travel much more expensive\u201d. Reeves said air passenger duty (APD) will rise from the 2026/27 financial year, adding up to \u00a32 to the cost of an economy ticket for a short-haul flight. Responding to the news that government sources have indicated that GP surgeries will not be eligible for compensation from the government\u2019s employers NICs rise (see 1.36pm GMT), Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, Daisy Cooper said: The government must scrap this GP penalty immediately. After years of the Conservatives disgraceful neglect, our primary care services are in crisis and this could push many to reduce the number of staff they employ or just decide to shut up shop. Instead of investing in our GPs and their staff, the government has put more pressure on them in a move that will make it even harder for patients to see a GP when they need to.\u201d The Bank of England is expected to cut interest rates next week, despite forecasts that Labour\u2019s autumn budget could lead to higher inflation over the coming year, reports the PA news agency. Policymakers will announce the result of their November meeting on Thursday, where most analysts think they will trim the base rate by a quarter-point to 4.75%. The president of the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) has said he is \u201cabsolutely baffled\u201d at the government\u2019s decision to \u201cdouble down\u201d on inheritance tax on farms. Tom Bradshaw, who is meeting environment secretary, Steve Reed, on Monday, said the current plans to change agricultural property relief (APR) and business property relief (BPR) \u201cneed to be overturned and fast\u201d. Speaking to the PA news agency, Bradshaw spoke of \u201ctension\u201d, \u201canger\u201d and \u201cfrustration\u201d among farming communities. But Reed said that the plans outlined in Wednesday\u2019s budget are a \u201cfair and balanced approach that protects family farms while also fixing the public services those same families rely on\u201d. The PA news agency reports that according to budget papers, from April 2026 farmers will be able to claim a 100% relief from inheritance tax on the first \u00a31m of combined agricultural and business assets, falling to 50% beyond that. Writing for The Daily Telegraph on Friday, Reed said: I completely understand farmers\u2019 anxiety at any changes. But rural communities need a better NHS, affordable housing and public transport we can provide if we make the system fairer. That is why the Labour government has announced plans to reform agricultural property relief. Only the richest estates will be asked to pay, not small, family farms as some misleading headlines have claimed. Look at the detail and you\u2019ll see that the vast majority of farmers will not be affected at all. They will be able to pass the family farm down to their children just as previous generations have always done.\u201d After reading Reed\u2019s article, Bradshaw told the PA news agency: Looks like they\u2019ve decided they\u2019re going to double down, which I\u2019m absolutely baffled by.\u201d Bradshaw said he has never seen the farming industry in the position it is in at the moment, and while this has built up over the last four or five years, he said: Today the tension, the anger, the frustration, it is so, so tangible. We will work with the government to find a resolution, but I just hope that resolution is forthcoming. I just think that what our members are saying to us is this is a government that doesn\u2019t understand farming. They\u2019ve shown us with this budget they just don\u2019t understand what we do to produce the country\u2019s food.\u201d He said farmers are deemed to be wealthy because they have an asset, but pointed out that the return from that asset is \u201cvery, very low\u201d. Bradshaw added: I think there\u2019s a real anger in the countryside that this government is demonstrating that they don\u2019t understand the farming industry. I was so pleased when I saw the Labour manifesto. Those words \u2018Food security is national security\u2019 are so important, but those words don\u2019t feed people. It\u2019s the family farms across the United Kingdom that produce people\u2019s food and are going to be adversely impacted by this change. And I really hope that the government can see that they\u2019ve got this wrong.\u201d The NFU said Britain\u2019s farmers and growers will take part in a mass lobby of their MPs over the plans on 19 November and Bradshaw said it is already \u201cmassively oversubscribed\u201d. While Reed referred to \u201cmisleading\u201d headlines, the NFU has used the same word to describe Treasury figures, according to the PA news agency. Bradshaw said he does not understand the Treasury\u2019s figures, adding: At a time of huge turmoil in the industry, with all the changes since Brexit, since Covid and the Ukrainian crisis, and all the inflation, to bring this change in now, especially when the secretary of state has talked publicly about understanding the pressures on the industry, the mental health challenges that the industry is facing, and then they brought this change in. I really do not understand who has done the modelling or how they\u2019ve got to this decision.\u201d The issue has been repeatedly raised in the House of Commons and business minister Douglas Alexander defended the government\u2019s reforms of inheritance tax, saying \u201cdifficult and necessary choices\u201d had to be made. Scottish councils say they must receive their fair share of new funds from the UK budget, as they called for \u201csustainable investment\u201d in local authorities, reports the PA news agency. Council umbrella body Cosla has written to the Scottish and UK governments seeking clarity on the funding arrangements, after chancellor, Rachel Reeves, delivered the first Labour budget in 14 years earlier this week. The Scottish government is now in line to receive \u00a347.7bn in the next financial year \u2013 including \u00a33.4bn due as a result of decisions made by the chancellor. Scottish Labour says the budget will lead to a further investment of \u00a31.4bn in a number of local projects over the next decade. These include town plans, levelling up money and green freeports. Cosla resources spokesperson, Katie Hagmann, said: Following the UK budget announcement, I have written today to both UK government and Scottish government seeking assurance that local government in Scotland and the communities we serve will receive our fair share of the additional funds announced in the UK budget. Scottish local government has seen significant cuts to our core settlement over time, and we hope that moving into 2025/26 we can begin to reverse these cuts and ensure that there is sustainable investment in local public services. We have sought assurances from the UK government around some areas, including the increase to employer national insurance contributions which will not only have a detrimental impact on councils as employers, but also on the many partner organisations who deliver vital services across our communities, for example social care and children\u2019s services. We will continue to work with both UK government and Scottish government to minimise any detriment to our communities and their local services.\u201d Commenting on the funding for local projects, Scottish Labour economy spokesperson Daniel Johnson said: As well as delivering the largest block grant in the history of devolution to the Scottish parliament, the Labour Government is investing another \u00a31.4bn directly in Scotland\u2019s future. This will help to renew infrastructure and promote growth the length and breadth of Scotland. Labour\u2019s direct investment in these projects will strengthen local communities and economies \u2013 but we need a government with ambition in Holyrood too.\u201d According to the PA news agency, a spokesperson for the Scottish government said: We are assessing the full implications of the chancellor\u2019s autumn budget statement. Finance secretary Shona Robison will be announcing further details as part of the Scottish budget on 4 December. We recognise the crucial role councils play in their communities. That is why we are making available record funding of more than \u00a314bn to councils in 2024-25 and our commitment to meaningful budget engagement with Cosla will continue ahead of the Scottish budget.\u201d A spokesperson for the UK government said: Funding for local government is a responsibility devolved to the Scottish government and the autumn budget provided it with a record \u00a347.7bn settlement \u2013 the largest in real terms in the history of devolution. Given the impacts of changes to employer national insurance contributions are complex, this settlement does not reflect this additional support the chancellor is providing for the public sector. We are working through the budget implications with the Scottish government.\u201d Rachel Reeves has been warned that her number one mission to boost Britain\u2019s economy is at risk amid fresh evidence that the budget has damaged business confidence after tremors in the financial markets. With the government under pressure to defend its tax and spending plans, business leaders said the chancellor had failed to halt a rapid deterioration in sentiment among company bosses ahead of the budget, with damaging consequences for their investment intentions. In a snap poll of more than 700 members of the Institute of Directors, the lobby group said two-thirds felt negatively about the budget and thought that it would not support the government\u2019s growth mission. Roger Barker, the director of policy at the Institute of Directors, said: Even before the chancellor had risen to deliver her budget speech, the confidence of business leaders had hit its lowest level since December 2022. Based on the results of our snap post-budget poll, it seems likely that sentiment will have deteriorated even further. By imposing significant new tax burdens on business, the government has taken a major risk with the economic recovery. The viability of its future spending plans will be compromised if growth is now snuffed out.\u201d The rating agency Moody\u2019s said the budget would do little to improve Britain\u2019s economic growth, and said Reeves\u2019s plans to add to government borrowing in the near-term would pose an \u201cadditional challenge\u201d to repairing the public finances. It comes as the yield \u2013 in effect the interest rate \u2013 on 10-year government bonds stabilised on Friday morning. The government\u2019s borrowing costs on financial markets had risen sharply over the previous two days since Wednesday\u2019s budget to trade above 4.5%, the highest level this year. City analysts said the reaction was driven by Reeves\u2019s plans to add to the UK\u2019s borrowing levels and the prospect of the Bank of England cutting interest rates by less than previously anticipated. With markets in a delicate position ahead of the US election next week, they also warned investors remained wary of Britain after Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget. \u201cWe expect financial markets to remain more sensitive to the potential for UK policy missteps, because of the gilt market turmoil that followed the September 2022 mini budget,\u201d Moody\u2019s said in a note to clients. Ryanair plans to cut flights to and from UK airports by 10% next year after Labour\u2019s decision to increase the tax on airline tickets in the autumn budget, reports the PA news agency. The airline\u2019s chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, criticised the spending statement on Friday, saying it has \u201cdamaged\u201d UK growth prospects and \u201cmade air travel much more expensive\u201d. According to the PA news agency, he said Ryanair would \u201creview\u201d its schedules and the planned reduction could lead to as many as five million fewer passengers at UK airports. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said air passenger duty (APD) will rise from the 2026/27 financial year, adding up to \u00a32 to the cost of an economy ticket for a short-haul flight. Private jet users will face a 50% rise in APD. Passenger duty rates are based on the length of the flight and the class of cabin. O\u2019Leary said it is \u201cvital\u201d that the UK makes it cheaper to fly, but that Labour had instead \u201cdamaged tourism, and damaged air travel to and from the UK\u201d. He said: Rachel Reeves\u2019 idiotic decision to further raise the UK\u2019s already high air travel taxes will deliver cuts, not growth. This shortsighted tax grab will make air travel much more expensive for ordinary UK families going on holidays abroad and will make the UK a less competitive destination compared to Ireland, Sweden, Hungary and Italy where these governments are abolishing travel taxes to stimulate traffic, tourism, and jobs growth in their economies.\u201d The PA news agency reports that Ryanair set a record for its passenger numbers in August, saying it carried 20.5 million people across the month, but its profits slumped 46% earlier in the year, after average air fares fell by about 15% in the three months to June. The chancellor told the Commons on Wednesday: Air passenger duty has not kept up with inflation in recent years so we are introducing an adjustment, meaning an increase of no more than \u00a32 for an economy class short-haul flight.\u201d O\u2019Leary\u2019s criticism of the policy comes after Karen Dee, chief executive of trade body AirportsUK, described the announcement as \u201cdisappointing\u201d. At a 40,000-strong rally in Trafalgar Square in London in July, the far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was characteristically defiant. \u201cDeath, prison or glory, we will never submit to your lies,\u201d he declared. \u201cThey want to send me to jail [but] the world will know I told the truth.\u201d On Monday, Robinson was duly sentenced to 18 months in prison for contempt of court. He had shown no remorse and there was no realistic prospect of rehabilitation, said Mr Justice Johnson at Woolwich crown court. \u201cAll of his actions so far suggest that he regards himself as above the law.\u201d In the dock, Robinson pumped his chest and saluted his loyal supporters in the public gallery. They blew kisses back. He was taken to Belmarsh high-security prison in south-east London. The jailing of Robinson is the latest episode in his apparently inexorable rise from the owner of a tanning salon in Luton, Bedfordshire, to the brash pin-up hero of the far right in the UK, the US and beyond. He is, arguably, the most potent individual to have emerged on the British far right since Enoch Powell. Along the way, he has served four jail terms, and has now begun his fifth. None appear to have led him to reflect on and reconsider his actions; indeed, they have reinforced his image as a political martyr to the cause of rightwing extremism. Robinson is a complex and often contradictory figure, but \u201cwe should not underestimate him\u201d, said Nick Lowles, the chief executive of the anti-racism campaign group Hope Not Hate, who has watched him closely for years. He is \u201cmassively charismatic\u201d with \u201cenormous reach\u201d, said Lowles. \u201cHe has an ability to bring huge crowds together on a level that we haven\u2019t seen previously. His videos are watched in the millions.\u201d You can read the full piece by Harriet Sherwood and Ben Quinn here: The Guardian\u2019s Esther Addley has written profiles on the background, policies and controversies of the two candidates hoping to lead the Conservative party: Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick. You can read the profiles here: The budget\u2019s \u201cclean bill of health\u201d with fiscal watchdogs should give investors confidence in Labour\u2019s plans, Rachel Reeves has said amid market fluctuations. Asked about post-budget market movements on a visit to Newcastle, the chancellor told broadcasters: I won\u2019t comment on market moves, because markets move all the time. What I am confirming is that the International Monetary Fund has given our budget a clean bill of health and the Office for Budget Responsibility have confirmed that we meet our fiscal rules two years early. That should give confidence to investors that we have a plan to secure our public finances after the instability and chaos of the last few years.\u201d Planned strikes by London Underground workers in the RMT have been suspended, the union announced. Workers were due to take action on Friday evening and on several days in the coming weeks in a dispute over pay. The RMT said it had received an improved pay offer. Strikes by members of the drivers\u2019 union Aslef next week and later in the month are still scheduled to go ahead. An RMT spokesperson said: Following intense negotiations with London Underground management and a significantly improved offer, we have suspended the strikes scheduled to start this evening. London Underground have sensibly abandoned their proposed changes to pay structures which now means all our members will receive the same value in any pay award. Further discussions will take place next week regarding the pay offer but progress has been made which would not have been possible without the fortitude and industrial strength of our 10,000 members on London Underground.\u201d PA Media has amended the earlier report (see post at 12.35pm) saying No 10 hinted that GP surgeries could get help with NICs. The quotes from a No 10 spokesperson were not intended as a hint that extra NICs compensation was coming, government sources have indicated. Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, has raised concerns over the budget creating a \u201clost generation\u201d of farmers. It comes as he visits an agricultural college in Maidenhead today with Lib Dem MP Joshua Reynolds. The Lib Dems say that analysis by the party has \u201craised fears of a \u00a370m cut to Defra\u2019s food and farming budget hidden in the fine print of the chancellor\u2019s plans, meaning even less government support for farmers who are already struggling after years of chaos and uncertainty caused by the Conservative party\u201d. The Lib Dems say they are concerned that changes to the agricultural property relief scheme will \u201cforce many to sell up small family-owned farms \u2013 with young people in rural communities across the country robbed of a future in farming as a result\u201d, and have called on the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to reverse the changes. Davey said: The government is at risk of creating a lost generation of farmers. Young people will lose the opportunity to keep the farms their families have run for generations, while at the same time they are seeing government support for farming slashed. Hitting British farmers who put food on our tables only risks making the cost-of-living crisis worse. After years of being taken for granted by the Conservative party, rural communities should have been properly supported in this budget. The chancellor now needs to listen to rural communities, reverse these measures and ensure the next generation of farmers is protected. Liberal Democrats backed British farmers by demanding an extra \u00a31bn to support them during the election, and we\u2019ll keep being a strong voice for our rural communities.\u201d Downing Street is confident changes to inheritance tax on farms will not impact food security and said there was adequate financial support available to farmers, reports the PA news agency. Asked if ministers were confident the changes will not hurt food security, a No 10 spokesperson said: Yes. We are committed to supporting farmers. There is an increase in the agricultural budget, there is also an increase in environmental schemes that support sustainable farming and food production. So, we would encourage farmers to get in contact where they have concerns so we can ensure everyone is receiving the support and schemes available to them, and also that they have the full details of how the agricultural property relief system works.\u201d The spokesperson said the government\u2019s message was \u201cclear that we are committed to supporting farmers\u201d, adding: It is expected that almost three-quarters of estates are expected to be unaffected by this.\u201d GP surgeries could receive extra support in light of the rise in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) later in the year, Downing Street has suggested. According to the PA news agency, a No 10 spokesperson said contracted workers, including GPs, were not eligible for an exemption from the NICs rise, which she said was consistent with the approach of previous governments. The No 10 spokesperson said: There is a general process whereby departments, the Department of Health for example, confirm their funding for general practices. I think that\u2019s part of the annual GP contract process. I believe that will take place later in the year.\u201d On social care, the spokesperson said: We are taking action to support the social care sector more generally. There is a real-terms increase in core local government spending power and I think at least \u00a3600m of new grant funding provided to address pressures in the sector.\u201d * Government sources later clarified that the \u2018contract process\u2019 comments did not mean to hint there would be compensation for GPs to deal with the rise in national insurance contributions (see later post at 13.36pm). Rachel Reeves\u2019s first budget, shared this week, emphasised raising taxes to help the NHS, as the health service tries to cope with huge waiting lists and an ageing population. Funding the NHS was a top priority but people in other sectors \u2013 from universities to social care \u2013 feel the budget was a missed opportunity to tackle impending crises or introduce desperately needed reforms in their areas. In case you missed this explainer on who lost out in the UK budget, written by our Whitehall editor, Rowena Mason, here is the link: The Independent Schools Council (ISC) has said it will launch legal action against the government\u2019s decision to impose VAT on independent school fees. The council, which represents more than 1,400 private schools in the UK and abroad, reached its decision after a board meeting held on Thursday. Human rights barrister David Pannick KC will lead the challenge, which will be brought on behalf of parents. It comes after the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, confirmed in the budget that 20% VAT would be applied to private schools from January, with the government estimating it could raise \u00a3460m next year, potentially rising to \u00a31.7bn by 2029/30. Julie Robinson, the chief executive of ISC, said: This is a decision that has not been taken lightly and has been under consideration for many months. At all points throughout this debate, our focus has been on the children in our schools who would be negatively impacted by this policy. This focus remains and we will be defending the rights of families who have chosen independent education but who may no longer be able to do so as a direct result of an unprecedented education tax.\u201d The government predicts that private school fees could rise by an average of 10% due to the introduction of VAT. It projects that about 35,000 pupils will transfer to state schools over time, as well as an additional 2,000 students leaving private institutions, including international pupils. European diplomats have called for the international institutions to retain the exemption. The German and French ambassadors to the UK, Miguel Berger and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Duch\u00eane, said international schools were distinct from British private schools because the option of transferring to the British state sector was not always realistic for their pupils. \u201cFor expats coming here for two, three or four years wanting their children to go back to the national system, their only option is to go to these schools,\u201d Berger said. He told the Times: We would really like to see the British government recognise the importance of these schools \u2013 not only for our political and cultural relations but also for the people this will affect.\u201d The growth in UK house prices slowed unexpectedly last month, Nationwide said, as it warned buyers to expect a rush in transactions early next year sparked by changes to stamp duty rules in the budget. The building society\u2019s monthly index showed that annual house prices grew at a rate of 2.4% in October, a slowdown from the near two-year high of 3.2% recorded in September. This was still the third highest rate of annual growth since December 2022, but was lower than experts had forecast, with a Reuters poll of economists predicting a 2.8% increase for the month. The average house in the UK cost \u00a3265,738 in October, a 0.1% increase from September. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said market activity remained resilient, with mortgage approvals approaching pre-pandemic levels, despite a significantly higher interest rate environment. However, he warned that the chancellor\u2019s decision to remove the temporary increase to the nil rate for stamp duty next April could spark a rush to complete purchases before the changes. In September 2022, the government temporarily increased the nil rate of stamp duty, the amount before you have to start paying stamp duty on a purchase, for homebuyers, raising the nil rate for first-time buyers from \u00a3300,000 to \u00a3450,000, and for those buying an additional home from \u00a3125,000 to \u00a3250,000. Rachel Reeves said during her budget on Wednesday that this would be scrapped from 31 March next year. Gardner said: The main impact of the stamp duty changes is likely to be on the timing of property transactions, as purchasers aim to ensure their house purchases complete before the tax change takes effect. This will lead to a jump in transactions in the first three months of 2025 (especially March), and a corresponding period of weakness in the following three to six months, as occurred in the wake of previous stamp duty changes.\u201d An EU citizen caught up in a Home Office backlog of applications for post-Brexit residency status has been forcibly removed from the UK. Costa Koushiappis, 39, a Greek Cypriot, was put onboard a plane to Amsterdam with only three days\u2019 notice. Speaking as he was being escorted on to the aircraft in Edinburgh shortly before 9am on Friday, he said he could not understand his unfolding nightmare. \u201cI am here with the Border Force. They have all my documents. I can\u2019t talk about how I feel because if I do will have a breakdown,\u201d Koushiappis added. When it became clear late on Thursday night that his lawyer was unable to get the Home Office to reverse the decision by Border Force, his friends came to his flat to help him pack up. His employer at Two Wheels motorbike franchise, Stuart West-Gray, described what had happened as a \u201cdisgrace\u201d. He said: I spoke to him this morning. He said the Border Force officials who had escorted him were very good to him and told him he had conducted himself very well, had adhered to the bail conditions and they didn\u2019t have to come look for him this morning. But why give someone three days to pack up their life? You would think they would at least give them 28 days so he could mount a legal case. When he was in the shop last night as we were closing, he said \u2018I\u2019ve got to go round and say goodbye to everyone\u2019. He was in tears as he went round the shop floor. It was absolutely heartbreaking.\u201d Koushiappis arrived in the UK in 2017, before Brexit, and \u2013 after an absence due to poor health and then Covid lockdowns \u2013 did not return until 2021. His subsequent application for pre-settled status was rejected by the Home Office on 28 October 2022 but then asked for a closer look at his case, as the rules allow. Days later, on 2 November, he applied for the \u201cadministrative review\u201d but was told as recently as 25 October the decision could take two years to be processed such was the backlog of cases. Meanwhile, a care group has called on the government to exempt social care providers from the tax rise or ringfence funding to cover it. Independent Care Group (ICG) chair Mike Padgham said: The government has to do something and it has to do it quickly, as I am already hearing from providers that this might be the last straw for some of them.\u201d Geoff Butcher, of the Blackadder Corporation, which owns a number of care homes in England, said he believes the rise in national insurance contributions (NICs) for employers could lead to some homes having to shut. According to the PA news agency, he told the Today programme: We will certainly not be taking on additional staff. We will be having to cut back on improvement. So this morning I was supposed to be going to a home to look at investing in a small extension and a new passenger lift. That almost certainly will have to go. And I know that colleagues in other services are looking at cutting back on staffing, and I think it will exacerbate the speed of closure of homes and the handing back of contracts by other services, including domiciliary [home] care.\u201d He said the \u00a3600m funding to local authorities for both adult and children\u2019s social care announced in the budget \u201cif it came through\u201d would equate to about only \u00a3350 for each employee in the social care sector. He said: Staff costs are 80% of our total cost. We\u2019ve got nowhere to go on this.\u201d Butcher said he finds it \u201cextraordinary that year after year, governments find billions to support the likes of Ukraine, but we don\u2019t find the money to support our very vulnerable people \u2013 I think it\u2019s a huge reflection on our society\u201d. Care England, which represents providers in adult social care, said the national insurance rise, combined with wage rises, will leave the sector with \u201can additional circa \u00a32.4bn funding hole to plug\u201d. The Independent Care Group said the new grant funding is likely to be \u201cwiped off instantly\u201d by both. GP surgeries will have to consider making staff redundant if the rise in employer national insurance contributions announced in the budget is not covered, the government has been told, reports the PA news agency. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced the tax rise on Wednesday, as organisations representing care homes and hospices voiced concerns about the sector\u2019s ability to plug the funding gap. There have also been concerns about the impact on GP surgeries, with one practice manager suggesting it could cost his practice about \u00a340,000 a year. Dr Jess Harvey, a GP based in Shropshire, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that practices will \u201creally struggle\u201d. She said: During these contract negotiations for our new contract, unless we\u2019re getting given suitable remuneration to cover this national insurance inflation, then we\u2019re going to really struggle. There are going to be practices to start to make redundancies. There are practices that were already considering redundancies because it\u2019s so hard to manage financially, and if we don\u2019t get enough money to continue to run these practices, then we\u2019re not going to be able to provide the service that people want.\u201d When asked if GP wages should \u201ctake a hit\u201d to cover costs, Harvey said: How general practice is funded, this isn\u2019t about GPs, this isn\u2019t about my wage. I don\u2019t want an increase in my wage. What I want to be able to do is to is to provide the same service that I\u2019m providing now, if not better, in the future.\u201d Harvey also said the amount of money surgeries are getting has not changed in six years, amid a rise in staffing costs. She added: Yes, we are classed as private businesses, but the money that we get to run that business isn\u2019t generated by profit, as I\u2019m sure you can imagine, in terms of we aren\u2019t charging people for service. The government give us a specific amount to run our general practice, which is based on the number of patients we have. The amount of money that we are getting at the moment is the same as we were getting in 2018.\u201d Paul Stanley, a practice manager at Gas House Lane surgery in Morpeth, Northumberland, told the Today programme the changes could cost his surgery about \u00a340,000 a year. He said: It is a huge amount of money and our staff costs do equate to, I would probably say, about 65-70% of all of the costs of the practice. I think what we\u2019re looking at is an unfunded increase in our staffing costs, which may ultimately impact on our resources and our staffing levels.\u201d Helen Morgan, health and social care spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said: We are urging the chancellor to change course and exempt GPs from a tax hike. This new government must not make the same mistakes as the Conservatives, fixing the GP crisis is crucial for saving the NHS. If people can be checked quicker, fewer will end up in hospital for treatment. That\u2019s better for patients, better for the NHS and better for taxpayers.\u201d After this week\u2019s budget, the usually mild-mannered National Farmers\u2019 Union president, Tom Bradshaw, blasted: Before the election Keir Starmer promised to establish a new relationship with farming and the countryside. Well, he\u2019s certainly done that.\u201d This highly unusual intervention from the body, which typically favours being \u201cin the room\u201d with prime ministers rather than publicly attacking them, reflected a strength of feeling in the agricultural world not felt since the unpopular Brexit trade deals. The main issue that is infuriating the farming community is the chancellor\u2019s change to agricultural property relief (APR). Steve Reed, the environment secretary, had promised that Labour had no intention of fiddling with this tax loophole designed to protect the family farm. On Wednesday Rachel Reeves announced that, from April 2026, the first \u00a31m of the value of agricultural properties will be exempt from inheritance tax (IHT), but above that threshold the combined relief available from APR and business property relief (BPR) will drop to 50% of the standard 40% rate of IHT. This means that inheritance tax of 20% will effectively apply on the full value of farms and rural estates above \u00a31m. In reference to Reed\u2019s broken vow, Bradshaw said: When you look farmers in the eye and make them a promise, keep it.\u201d You can read Helena\u2019s full explainer on this here: Reform UK is facing a schism over its approach to Tommy Robinson\u2019s supporters, after two high-profile party figures said it was wrong to disavow those who went to a weekend rally backing the far-right leader. Richard Tice, the deputy leader of Reform, said earlier this week the party \u201cwant nothing to do with\u201d Robinson and \u201call of that lot\u201d. Nigel Farage, the Reform leader, also said after the summer riots that he had never had anything to do with \u201cthe Tommy Robinsons and those who genuinely do stir up hatred\u201d. But two high-profile 2024 candidates, Howard Cox and Ben Habib, took a different position, saying those attending Saturday\u2019s rally were some of Reform\u2019s own people. Thousands of supporters of Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, protested in central London on Saturday after he was remanded into custody by police. The far-right activist was jailed on Monday for 18 months for contempt of court for repeating false allegations against a Syrian refugee, in breach of an injunction. After the sentencing, Cox, who stood as Reform\u2019s London mayoral candidate and as a parliamentary candidate in Dover and Deal, said Robinson should not be in jail and Tice had been wrong to distance the party from those who attended the rally. You can read the full report by Rowena Mason and Peter Walker here: Rachel Reeves has been warned an extra \u00a39bn of tax rises may be required to avoid a fresh austerity drive in key public services as her record tax-raising budget sent tremors through the financial markets. Threatening to undermine the chancellor\u2019s claim that her budget would restore economic stability to Britain, government borrowing costs rose sharply in the City on Thursday as traders turned on Reeves\u2019s tax and spending measures. On a day of wider losses in global markets, the negative reaction came despite the International Monetary Fund lending its backing to the first Labour budget in 14 years as the government sought to defend its plans. The yield \u2013 in effect the interest rate \u2013 on benchmark 10-year government bonds jumped to the highest level this year, rising by more than 0.15 percentage points to above 4.5% on Thursday, before falling back slightly by the evening. The higher the yield, the more the government has to pay to borrow money. City traders warned the higher short-term borrowing levels set out in the budget threatened to derail the Bank of England from pushing ahead with a deep round of interest rate cuts. The pound also fell against the US dollar to its lowest for two months. Some analysts sought to draw comparisons with Liz Truss\u2019s mini budget, when financial markets were thrown into a tailspin, although they cautioned that the gyrations in the City were far less substantial this time. Others said there were dangers in holding the budget in proximity to a closely-fought US election, amid a febrile backdrop for a historic tax and spending package. Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the fallout from Reeves\u2019s budget was \u201cstill a very long way from the 2022 \u2018mini-budget\u2019 debacle\u201d, but that the similarities could trigger alarm bells in Westminster. \u201cA meltdown of similar proportions remains unlikely, but plainly investors are nervous about the fiscal outlook in the UK (and elsewhere),\u201d he said. You can read the full piece by Richard Partington and Jessica Elgot here: More on the comments by the chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones. Jones said: Under Liz Truss they sacked the permanent secretary [to the Treasury], they ignored the independent Office Budget Responsibility, they announced \u00a345bn of unfunded tax cuts and said they were only just getting started. And then the market went mad, and we all know what happened then.\u201d Asked about the market response to the budget, he said: There\u2019s a lot of new information about the economy and the nation\u2019s finances presented to parliament, and it\u2019s normal for markets to respond.\u201d But he added: I understand why you asked the question, because everybody suffered as a consequence of the way the Conservatives managed the economy.\u201d Jones also defended the government paying \u00a3950 a day to a new value for money chair David Goldstone. Asked by LBC about Goldstone\u2019s salary as the head of the Office for Value for Money (OVFM), Jones said: The rate of return for the improvements that we will make from looking at these areas of spending will be far, far greater.\u201d He added: It is right that we pay people for their time. We can\u2019t expect people to work for free. That is an important way in which we do things in this country. Actually, the day rate for David is, on a benchmark basis, competitive.\u201d Goldstone is also a non-executive director of the Submarine Delivery Agency and HS2 Ltd, and was previously chief executive of parliament\u2019s Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority, as well as working as chief operating officer at the Ministry of Defence. He oversaw the government\u2019s \u00a39.3bn investment for the 2012 Olympics, including the Olympic Park venues and infrastructure. The UK is in a \u201cvery different world\u201d compared with the turmoil which followed Liz Truss\u2019s economic plans, a minister has said as the government seeks to quell post-budget market jitters. The scale of extra borrowing in Rachel Reeves\u2019s budget \u2013 around \u00a332bn a year on average \u2013 saw yields on government bonds increase as the market responded to the chancellor\u2019s plans. The value of the pound has also fallen against the dollar after Labour\u2019s first budget in more than 14 years. But Darren Jones, Reeves\u2019s deputy at the Treasury, told Sky News that \u201cmarkets always respond to budgets in the normal way\u201d. \u201cI think we\u2019ve all got PTSD from Liz Truss,\u201d he added, according to the PA news agency. The Treasury minister compared Truss\u2019s decision to sack the Treasury\u2019s chief official and snub an analysis of her spending by fiscal watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), with Labour\u2019s plans. He added: Completely different in contrast to now: We\u2019ve got verified reports from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility that say we meet our fiscal rules earlier than had been planned originally, 2027-2028, that those tough fiscal rules means there is a fiscal consolidation and that strong approach to public spending. We\u2019re in a very, very different world.\u201d He conceded that the headline budget tax rise in national insurance contributions (NICs) for employers would impact \u201cworking people\u201d, after a similar admission by Reeves. The \u00a325.7bn change to employers\u2019 NICs is expected to raise about \u00a316.1bn by 2029/30 as firms curb wage rises, cut hours and reduce profits \u2013 while public sector employers get compensation in their budgets for the change. Asked by Sky News if it would impact workers, Jones said: Yes, but the question in the manifesto, the promise in the manifesto, was not to increase the rate of tax that employees pay in their payslip. It says that we make a promise to working people, that\u2019s people who go to work and get a payslip, that we will not increase income tax or national insurance.\u201d The Resolution Foundation economic thinktank has called the increase a \u201ctax on working people\u201d, and said it will show up in their payslips in slower growth. Jones also admitted to broadcasters that GPs and care homes will have to pay the NICs increase. But he told BBC Breakfast some GPs \u201cmay end up in a better position than they were in before\u201d because of extra investment across the NHS. More on that in a moment, but first, here is an update of the latest developments in UK politics: Rachel Reeves has been warned an extra \u00a39bn of tax rises may be required to avoid a fresh austerity drive in key public services as her record tax-raising budget sent tremors through the financial markets. Threatening to undermine the chancellor\u2019s claim that her budget would restore economic stability to Britain, government borrowing costs rose sharply in the City on Thursday as traders turned on Reeves\u2019s tax and spending measures. Reform UK is facing a schism over its approach to Tommy Robinson\u2019s supporters, after two high-profile party figures said it was wrong to disavow those who went to a weekend rally backing the far-right leader. The Independent Schools Council (ISC) has said it will launch legal action against the government\u2019s decision to impose VAT on independent school fees. The council, which represents more than 1,400 private schools in the UK and abroad, reached its decision after a board meeting held on Thursday. More than half of people expect the number of those living in poverty to have risen by the end of the government\u2019s current term, according to a study. Four in 10 Labour voters expect this to be the case by 2029, the research from King\u2019s College London (KCL) and the Fairness Foundation suggested.",

Millions of people face soaring rents, poor housing conditions, little prospect of owning their own home and shameful levels of homelessness as a result of an abject failure to build the homes we need. For too long, a safe, secure home has been a luxury for the few, not a privilege for the many. The budget\u2019s \u00a35bn investment in housebuilding is a first step to deliver our bold plan for 1.5m new homes over the next five years, including an injection of \u00a3500m for the affordable homes programme. And there will be \u00a33bn of guarantees to help smaller housebuilders and build-to-rent providers access the finance they need to get building too. We are also strengthening protections for council housing, to stem the loss of precious stock while still providing opportunities for first-time buyers in every community. Everyone should be able to count on a secure, decent, affordable home on which to build a good life \u2013 our approach will make this available to millions more working people. This week\u2019s budget was for them: delivering for the lowest-paid, protecting people\u2019s payslips, improving their living standards and setting our country on the path to a brighter future with a political compass that points to social justice. If you are in casual work, and unable to rely on guaranteed hours; if you are working on low pay and struggling to make ends meet; if you are stuck waiting for a secure home \u2013 this is a Labour government delivering for you. The budget is not only a set of policies, but a bold political vision that breaks with the past and begins a new chapter. It is an era-defining moment driven by Labour values. We have nailed our colours to the mast and embarked on a journey of national renewal. Angela Rayner is the deputy prime minister Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "bodyText": "The chief secretary to the Treasury has claimed the UK is still suffering from the trauma of Liz Truss\u2019s economic mismanagement amid market jitters after this week\u2019s budget. Darren Jones said \u201cwe are in a very different world\u201d from the market panic that followed Truss\u2019s mini-budget two years ago, despite a slight rise in government borrowing costs and a drop in the value of the pound in the past 48 hours. \u201cI think we\u2019ve all got PTSD from Liz Truss,\u201d Jones told Sky News. He said: \u201cUnder Liz Truss they sacked the permanent secretary [to the Treasury], they ignored the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, they announced \u00a345bn of unfunded tax cuts and said they were only just getting started. And then the market went mad, and we all know what happened then.\u201d Jones added: \u201c[It is] completely different in contrast to now. We\u2019ve got verified reports from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility that say we meet our fiscal rules earlier than had been planned, that those tough fiscal rules means there is a fiscal consolidation and a strong approach to public spending.\u201d Asked about the market response to the budget, he said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of new information about the economy and the nation\u2019s finances presented to parliament, and it\u2019s normal for markets to respond.\u201d But he added: \u201cI understand why you asked the question, because everybody suffered as a consequence of the way the Conservatives managed the economy.\u201d Jones also defended the government paying \u00a3950 a day to a new value for money chair, David Goldstone. Asked by LBC about Goldstone\u2019s salary as the head of the Office for Value for Money (OVFM), Jones said: \u201cThe rate of return for the improvements that we will make from looking at these areas of spending will be far, far greater.\u201d He added: \u201cIt is right that we pay people for their time. We can\u2019t expect people to work for free. That is an important way in which we do things in this country. Actually, the day rate for David is, on a benchmark basis, competitive.\u201d Goldstone is also a non-executive director of the Submarine Delivery Agency and HS2 Ltd, and was previously chief executive of parliament\u2019s Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority, as well as working as chief operating officer at the Ministry of Defence.

He said that the new Brexit costs have played a big part in this, as well as the tightening of supply of Danish and other European trees, as more farmers have left the industry. According to the British Christmas Tree Growers Association (BCTGA), more than 8m Christmas trees were sold in the UK in 2021. Experts the Guardian has spoken to believe that between 20% and 40% of trees could come from overseas, with most from EU countries like Denmark, the UK\u2019s biggest supplier, Germany and Poland. Not only do these trees now require extra paperwork but for the first time they will be subject to checks at newly introduced border posts, set up near ports. These checks require importers to not only pay an inspection charge, often regardless of whether the trees have been inspected, but also increase the chance of delays and damage to consignments. Stephan Meijer, a Dutch exporter of plants to the UK, said all of these elements are racking up the costs to transport all plants, including Christmas trees. \u201cAt the bottom of every invoice we are putting \u2018\u00a3148 = Brexit cost\u2019, and that is a contribution, we share the cost, the real cost on every delivery is around \u00a3300,\u201d he said.

While the destruction is an extreme case and was ultimately successful in stopping pests entering, Meijer said this incident, and regular stories of delays and damage at the border, have had a chilling effect on suppliers. \u201cI\u2019m 100% seeing suppliers turning their backs on the UK because there is a risk,\u201d he said. However, while prices may rise, there is unlikely to be any shortage of trees. The majority sold in the UK are grown in the country, with the BCTGA saying there were more than enough to supply Britain\u2019s homes and UK production was actually increasing. Russell Parkins, chair of the BCTGA, believes that the additional hurdles for importers from the EU could actually help boost demand for domestic growers, for fully formed trees but also saplings. Many products grown in the UK, from tomatoes to raspberries, are transported from EU countries as young plants to be grown here. UK-grown Christmas trees often start life as saplings in Danish nurseries. Parkins, whose Dane End Christmas Tree Farm in Hertfordshire sells up to 3,000 trees a year, said: \u201cNow, because of us leaving Europe, there\u2019s some shrewder growers that are now growing saplings and looking to market those, because there\u2019s a gap in the market.\u201d Jadecliff, a Berkshire-based grower and wholesaler, imports about half of its trees from the EU.

They\u2019re Islamic windows.\u201d I look, as he urges, at the unglassed stone windows from Agra that are installed all around us in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum\u2019s South Asia gallery. If you have ever visited it, you will have seen them, but not everyone looks as closely as Khan. \u201cLook at the repetition,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can see it in all these patterns.\u201d</p> <p>He means this as praise \u2013 and it\u2019s easy to see the beauty of that apparently infinite repetition. The yellowish sandstone window grilles have a dazzling range of designs \u2013 floral, crystalline, triangular \u2013 in every window, interlocking and extrapolating and expanding with a complex regularity that looks as if it may go on for ever, far beyond these cooling lattices.</p>    <p>The first time I saw the work of Waqas Khan was in the <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/info/jameel-prize?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw1Yy5BhD-ARIsAI0RbXapf9dlfm7Vn0R3A0PsV0FQMMJPo3V3-kZ1urpN_GuizVQPhhNRpS0aAhH5EALw_wcB\">Jameel prize</a> here at the V&amp;A in London. His microscopically precise yet vastly conceptualised abstract drawings took the art heritage of the Islamic world into a modern, ethereally beautiful new vision. Since then, he has expanded his art into big abstract canvases, adding a painterly feel for colour to his graphic brilliance. He is one of the most exciting abstractionists of our time.</p> <p>He\u2019s also an artist with rich historical roots. We are here to look at the V&amp;A\u2019s remarkable collection of art from India and Pakistan ahead of <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/great-mughals-art-architecture-opulence?gclid=Cj0KCQjw1Yy5BhD-ARIsAI0RbXZNPOUE7sSd7jHMykk_DQdEBSBN56duyaVDS_TxaSpP6no2dkydBtkaAlatEALw_wcB&amp;gad_source=1&amp;src=google_ads_grant_awareness_london\">The Great Mughals</a>, a blockbuster exhibition that overlaps with Khan showing his own work in the UK, at <a href=\"https://www.purdyhicks.com/\">Purdy Hicks</a> in London. The Great Mughals aims to unveil the art and architecture of the early Mughal empire, from 1560 to 1660. If that sounds specialist, think again. In fact, think Taj Mahal.</p> <p>That unique building in Agra, where all the V&amp;A\u2019s Jali come from, is indisputably among the world\u2019s most beautiful. It was raised by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in 1631 and its famous story is wildly romantic: he built this filigree weightless wonder as a tomb for his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Its delicate embodiment of passion is typical of the early Mughals, who liked to have themselves portrayed literally smelling the flowers. \u201cThey loved the beauty around them,\u201d says Khan.</p>    <p>We move on to look at a fantastical painting of a prince fighting a demon under a brilliantly flowing, joyously unreal pattern of blue sky and white clouds. \u201cThis is from the Hamzanama,\u201d says Khan. It\u2019s one of the superb illustrations commissioned by the emperor Akbar in the mid-16th century for a book about the life of Muhammad\u2019s uncle. As well as building delicately gorgeous pavilions, palaces and tombs in Agra, Lahore, Delhi and more \u2013 even their massive forts are ravishing inside \u2013 the early Mughals sponsored a golden age of miniature painting, the figurative Muslim court art that had originated in 14th-century Persia.</p> <p>What does he think of so much art from Pakistan and India being owned by the V&amp;A, which inherited much of it from the East India Company\u2019s India Museum? \u201cAt least it\u2019s preserved,\u201d he says. \u201cNow we have museums, now we are working on those things, but at least it has been preserved.\u201d</p>    <p>Khan in fact trained as a miniaturist. He explains how you learn to paint a Mughal miniature, by imitating one put in front of you: \u201cThey give you this and you have to copy it. It\u2019s done with a squirrel brush.\u201d He was trained to do this at the National College of Arts in Lahore, Pakistan. He loves this city, one of the great centres of the early Mughals, and still lives there. But he was born in the Punjab countryside: \u201cFor me, going to that school was a cultural shock \u2013 the guy from the village going to this art college. None of the family knows about art, \u2018What is art all about?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He stresses that he didn\u2019t just study miniature painting: it was a module of a much broader course. I have visited the college with him to see where he worked on miniaturism as a student. It is a 19th-century building whose founding principal was John Lockwood Kipling, father of Rudyard. Like much of the British imperial architecture in Lahore, the National College in fact emulates Islamic art, creating a neo-Mughal style. So you pass through sunny courtyards and shady arcades to find a calm white-walled workspace with a high gallery reached by an old staircase. Here, Khan showed me the small space where he first fell in love with the intricate, meditative practice of miniaturist work. \u201cI loved the space,\u201d he says.</p>    <p>But Khan applies Mughal skills of precision, of calligraphy even, and turns them into abstract art. He spends many hours a week drawing in his studio in what he says is not just work but a \u201cmeditative\u201d practice. The lines he weaves are free and abstract. He\u2019s not drawing princes and demons but lattices and labyrinths, exact yet seemingly infinite, shimmering circles and lines of unreadable script.</p> <p>He feels a true affinity, he says, for the abstract patterns of the big rugs hanging above the V&amp;A\u2019s Mughal miniatures: he wants me to look at their complex repeating designs. We follow the magic carpet ride through from the South Asia gallery to admire abstract designs from across the Islamic world, gazing at the interlaced wood-and-ivory stars on a 15th-century <em>minbar</em> (a stepped pulpit from Cairo) and at the vast Ardabil Carpet, woven in 1500s Persia by \u201cthe slave of the portal, Maqsud Kashani\u201d (as it is signed), with its stupefyingly subtle blend of realistic flowers and algorithmic self-reproduction.</p> <p>All the \u201crepetitions\u201d Waqas points to in Mughal, Persian and North African art have the unstoppable energy of an algorithm that will never stop or end. The Persian word algorithm is named for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Khwarizmi\">Mu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b</a>, who wrote on these computational instructions in the ninth century as Islamic art was taking shape. Khan seems to channel this algorithmic beauty.</p>    <p>Afterwards, we walk to the nearby Purdy Hicks gallery where he has some work in a group show. They are brilliantly enigmatic <a href=\"https://www.purdyhicks.com/artists/100-waqas-khan/works/\">blue canvases</a> in which white unreadable script \u2013 like ghost calligraphy \u2013 and interlaced cosmic circles like the <em>Jali</em> from Agra, hold your eye, mind and soul. He has recently looked hard at Mark Rothko\u2019s paintings: we talk about the <a href=\"https://www.rothkochapel.org/\">Rothko Chapel</a> in Houston, where you can read the Qur\u2019an, Torah, Christian Bible \u2013 or simply nothing \u2013 as you contemplate his art. There is an affinity between these blue canvases and Rothko: they are vertical layerings of rectangular shapes that create a hypnotic aura. It comes partly from the amazing colour built up with extreme subtlety to generate depth.</p> <p>Over this deep colour are his painstakingly penned sequences of dots, forming bubbles and wordless writing. This is art to transport you. To his Mughal heritage, Khan has added the majesty of Rothko. Muslim history merges with American modernism. Lahore meets Manhattan.</p> <p>Khan\u2019s work is uplifting and entrancing. He is an artist of peace in a world at war.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/great-mughals-art-architecture-opulence?srsltid=AfmBOooYKZskDbqwWFUw9N4IqzYXrDMQ0hL6QUFJAU1FvjBLJR7BegKL\">The Great Mughals</a> opens at the V&amp;A, London, on 9 November.

It\u2019s done with a squirrel brush.\u201d He was trained to do this at the National College of Arts in Lahore, Pakistan. He loves this city, one of the great centres of the early Mughals, and still lives there. But he was born in the Punjab countryside: \u201cFor me, going to that school was a cultural shock \u2013 the guy from the village going to this art college. None of the family knows about art, \u2018What is art all about?\u2019\u201d He stresses that he didn\u2019t just study miniature painting: it was a module of a much broader course. I have visited the college with him to see where he worked on miniaturism as a student. It is a 19th-century building whose founding principal was John Lockwood Kipling, father of Rudyard. Like much of the British imperial architecture in Lahore, the National College in fact emulates Islamic art, creating a neo-Mughal style. So you pass through sunny courtyards and shady arcades to find a calm white-walled workspace with a high gallery reached by an old staircase. Here, Khan showed me the small space where he first fell in love with the intricate, meditative practice of miniaturist work. \u201cI loved the space,\u201d he says. But Khan applies Mughal skills of precision, of calligraphy even, and turns them into abstract art. He spends many hours a week drawing in his studio in what he says is not just work but a \u201cmeditative\u201d practice. The lines he weaves are free and abstract. He\u2019s not drawing princes and demons but lattices and labyrinths, exact yet seemingly infinite, shimmering circles and lines of unreadable script. He feels a true affinity, he says, for the abstract patterns of the big rugs hanging above the V&amp;A\u2019s Mughal miniatures: he wants me to look at their complex repeating designs. We follow the magic carpet ride through from the South Asia gallery to admire abstract designs from across the Islamic world, gazing at the interlaced wood-and-ivory stars on a 15th-century minbar (a stepped pulpit from Cairo) and at the vast Ardabil Carpet, woven in 1500s Persia by \u201cthe slave of the portal, Maqsud Kashani\u201d (as it is signed), with its stupefyingly subtle blend of realistic flowers and algorithmic self-reproduction. All the \u201crepetitions\u201d Waqas points to in Mughal, Persian and North African art have the unstoppable energy of an algorithm that will never stop or end. The Persian word algorithm is named for Mu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b, who wrote on these computational instructions in the ninth century as Islamic art was taking shape. Khan seems to channel this algorithmic beauty. Afterwards, we walk to the nearby Purdy Hicks gallery where he has some work in a group show. They are brilliantly enigmatic blue canvases in which white unreadable script \u2013 like ghost calligraphy \u2013 and interlaced cosmic circles like the Jali from Agra, hold your eye, mind and soul. He has recently looked hard at Mark Rothko\u2019s paintings: we talk about the Rothko Chapel in Houston, where you can read the Qur\u2019an, Torah, Christian Bible \u2013 or simply nothing \u2013 as you contemplate his art. There is an affinity between these blue canvases and Rothko: they are vertical layerings of rectangular shapes that create a hypnotic aura. It comes partly from the amazing colour built up with extreme subtlety to generate depth. Over this deep colour are his painstakingly penned sequences of dots, forming bubbles and wordless writing. This is art to transport you. To his Mughal heritage, Khan has added the majesty of Rothko. Muslim history merges with American modernism. Lahore meets Manhattan. Khan\u2019s work is uplifting and entrancing. He is an artist of peace in a world at war. \u2022 The Great Mughals opens at the V&amp;A, London, on 9 November. Waqas Khan\u2019s work is at Purdy Hicks, London, until 16 November.",

This time last year he had fallen to No&nbsp;91 in the world after yet another injury-ravaged season, which included him retiring from the French Open and then missing Wimbledon. \u00adRemaining injury-free for almost the entire year, aside from a minor abdominal injury in Tokyo, has allowed Draper to keep on developing. </p> <p>\u201cThis is my first proper year on tour, I\u2019d say,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m [ranked] whatever I am in the world and I\u2019ve still got so much to improve, so much to learn, so much to grow from. I\u2019m nowhere near my ceiling.

And that\u2019s \u00adexciting, because a lot of players, maybe they don\u2019t have a lot of things to improve on.\u201d </p> <p>This has also been a significant year for Draper off the court. He has talked repeatedly about how he has learned to work consistently each day, which has changed his perspective on his sport. He also just seems to have matured into a more composed, self-confident adult. </p> <p>\u201cI feel incredibly different,\u201d said Draper. \u201cI\u2019m a lot calmer myself. I have a lot more belief in my tennis, my life outside of the court, it\u2019s hard as a young player. You\u2019re so busy with playing tennis, your life kind of is put on hold. But I\u2019ve understood to have a good balance. In London, I can train, but I\u2019ve also got my own place. I feel very content with a lot of things. I\u2019ve just become more my own person, which is really good.\u201d </p> <p>Earlier this week, he bluntly stated that he wants to head into the new season \u201cchasing\u201d the likes of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner at the top of the game. It was quite a \u00adstatement, particularly for a fairly understated personality. But after a year in which he has taken such significant steps towards his lofty goals, eradicating many of the doubts he had about his future, it would be more shocking if he did not believe that he can take his game to the very top of his sport.</p> <h2 data-note-id=\"5056cb63-4c38-4a93-962e-63192f4210cb\" data-type=\"subhead\"><strong>Boulter reaches Hong Kong semis</strong></h2> <p>Katie Boulter maintained her impressive form to reach the Hong Kong Open semi-finals after beating Russia\u2019s Anastasia Zakharova in straight sets.</p> <p>Boulter edged a hard-fought opening frame against an inspired opponent, who was playing to a standard above her world ranking of No 113. The British No 1 was able to run away with the second set to win 6-4, 6-0. She faces Yuan Yue in the last four after the tournament\u2019s sixth seed overcame Sofia Kenin 6-3, 6-3.</p> <p>Zakharova matched Boulter, the No 2 seed in Hong Kong, for most of the opening set but the Briton was able to raise her level when it mattered. After holding serve with an ace to lead 5-4, Boulter sealed the first break of the match and took the set after Zakharova hit a forehand into the net.</p>    <p>Boulter was again under pressure in the opening game of the second set, but the world No 29 held her serve and then produced a fabulous volley on break point to move into a 2-0 lead. A second break came after a stunning cross-court forehand as Boulter cruised into a 4-0 lead. After holding serve once more, she broke Zakharova for a third time to wrap up victory in an hour and 16 minutes. Victory moves Boulter up two places to a career-high 27th in the provisional WTA rankings.</p> <p>\u201cFirst set, I think I was on another planet,\u201d Boulter said of her slow start. \u201cShe [Zakharova] was playing some really good tennis. I felt like at 5-4 I started to pick myself up a bit more. I played some pretty good stuff after that.\u201d</p> <p>Boulter faced China\u2019s Yuan in the first round of the Australian Open in January, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/16/jack-draper-survives-heat-to-win-gruelling-australian-open-opener-tennis\">winning 7-5, 7-6 (1)</a>. \u201cThat was an absolute battle, I thought we played a really good match and there wasn\u2019t much in it,\u201d Boulter told Sky Sports.</p> <p>\u201cTomorrow\u2019s going to be really tough, I\u2019ve watched a lot of her matches this week, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s been watching my games,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s the end of the year, I\u2019m still smiling and still having fun.\u201d</p> <p>On the other side of the draw, No 1 seed Diana Shnaider beat Suzan Lemens 6-0, 6-7 (4), 6-2 to set up a semi-final with Leylah Fernandez.

Remaining injury-free for almost the entire year, aside from a minor abdominal injury in Tokyo, has allowed Draper to keep on developing. \u201cThis is my first proper year on tour, I\u2019d say,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m [ranked] whatever I am in the world and I\u2019ve still got so much to improve, so much to learn, so much to grow from. I\u2019m nowhere near my ceiling. I honestly believe that there\u2019s so many areas in my game that need to be better, and have to be better if I\u2019m going to be winning the biggest events in the world. And that\u2019s exciting, because a lot of players, maybe they don\u2019t have a lot of things to improve on.\u201d This has also been a significant year for Draper off the court. He has talked repeatedly about how he has learned to work consistently each day, which has changed his perspective on his sport. He also just seems to have matured into a more composed, self-confident adult. \u201cI feel incredibly different,\u201d said Draper. \u201cI\u2019m a lot calmer myself. I have a lot more belief in my tennis, my life outside of the court, it\u2019s hard as a young player. You\u2019re so busy with playing tennis, your life kind of is put on hold. But I\u2019ve understood to have a good balance. In London, I can train, but I\u2019ve also got my own place. I feel very content with a lot of things. I\u2019ve just become more my own person, which is really good.\u201d Earlier this week, he bluntly stated that he wants to head into the new season \u201cchasing\u201d the likes of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner at the top of the game. It was quite a statement, particularly for a fairly understated personality. But after a year in which he has taken such significant steps towards his lofty goals, eradicating many of the doubts he had about his future, it would be more shocking if he did not believe that he can take his game to the very top of his sport. Boulter reaches Hong Kong semis Katie Boulter maintained her impressive form to reach the Hong Kong Open semi-finals after beating Russia\u2019s Anastasia Zakharova in straight sets. Boulter edged a hard-fought opening frame against an inspired opponent, who was playing to a standard above her world ranking of No 113. The British No 1 was able to run away with the second set to win 6-4, 6-0. She faces Yuan Yue in the last four after the tournament\u2019s sixth seed overcame Sofia Kenin 6-3, 6-3. Zakharova matched Boulter, the No 2 seed in Hong Kong, for most of the opening set but the Briton was able to raise her level when it mattered. After holding serve with an ace to lead 5-4, Boulter sealed the first break of the match and took the set after Zakharova hit a forehand into the net. Boulter was again under pressure in the opening game of the second set, but the world No 29 held her serve and then produced a fabulous volley on break point to move into a 2-0 lead. A second break came after a stunning cross-court forehand as Boulter cruised into a 4-0 lead. After holding serve once more, she broke Zakharova for a third time to wrap up victory in an hour and 16 minutes. Victory moves Boulter up two places to a career-high 27th in the provisional WTA rankings. \u201cFirst set, I think I was on another planet,\u201d Boulter said of her slow start. \u201cShe [Zakharova] was playing some really good tennis. I felt like at 5-4 I started to pick myself up a bit more. I played some pretty good stuff after that.\u201d Boulter faced China\u2019s Yuan in the first round of the Australian Open in January, winning 7-5, 7-6 (1). \u201cThat was an absolute battle, I thought we played a really good match and there wasn\u2019t much in it,\u201d Boulter told Sky Sports. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s going to be really tough, I\u2019ve watched a lot of her matches this week, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s been watching my games,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s the end of the year, I\u2019m still smiling and still having fun.\u201d On the other side of the draw, No 1 seed Diana Shnaider beat Suzan Lemens 6-0, 6-7 (4), 6-2 to set up a semi-final with Leylah Fernandez. The No 3 seed from Canada beat Bernarda Pera 6-1, 7-6 (7) in their quarter-final. PA Media",

      "body": "<p>The face said it all. As Rachel Reeves listed the infrastructure projects being funded by her first budget, she could not even say how much the biggest one would cost. She announced a \u00a322.6bn cash injection for the NHS in England over two years and an extra \u00a32.3bn a year in core funding for English schools. Television showed the relevant ministers cheering to the skies. But when she mentioned a <a href=\"https://www.railmagazine.com/news/2024/10/30/chancellor-confirms-hs2-trains-will-run-to-euston\">certain railway tunnel</a> from Old Oak Common to Euston in London, the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, was not cheering. We saw only a jaw tightening into what looked like a grimace.</p> <p>HS2, the greatest white elephant in British history, has lived to fight another day. Once costed at \u00a330bn and then soaring to \u00a3100bn, even stripped of its northern limbs it is <a href=\"https://www.constructionenquirer.com/2024/01/10/hs2-to-birmingham-true-cost-likely-to-be-67bn/#:~:text=The%20cost%20of%20building%20HS2,%C2%A367bn%20at%20today's%20prices.&amp;text=The%20new%20estimate%20provided%20by,expected%20to%20cost%20in%202013\">currently expected to cost \u00a367bn</a>. A year ago Rishi Sunak added himself to the list of shame of prime ministers who lacked the courage to kill it. But he did stop the building of the London link from Old Oak Common to Euston. The cost of the Euston terminus alone had ballooned from \u00a32.6bn to \u00a34.8bn. It was clearly out of control and the London end of the project was in effect banned.</p> <p>Winding up the work and securing the site was expected to cost a mind-blowing <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5803/cmselect/cmpubacc/1004/report.html#heading-2\">\u00a3200m</a>. Two giant tunnelling machines <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/hs2-old-oak-common-london-euston-b1100099.html\">now sit buried</a> under Old Oak Common. Around them spread acres of desolation \u2013 of evicted families and flattened businesses. But at least it half made sense. Sunak could then redistribute the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/hs2-will-run-to-london-euston-after-chancellor-commits-to-funding\">alleged \u00a36.5bn</a> it would have cost to finish the project to urgently needed rail projects in the north.</p> <p>The only future Sunak could offer for Euston was that a private developer might step forward to pay for the tunnel and the new station out of the profits from the rest of the site. Since this seemed improbable, the assumption was that sooner or later, a government might have the wit to admit that it was all a ghastly mistake and return the Euston acres to the people of Camden.</p> <p>Last February the Commons\u2019 public accounts committee reviewed Sunak\u2019s decision on Euston. Its report made dire reading. It in effect dismissed the entire HS2 project as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68217031\">very poor value for money</a>\u201d. But it particularly remarked that his privatisation of Euston did not add up. Whitehall did not have \u201ca plausible or detailed proposition it could take to the market\u201d, <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5804/cmselect/cmpubacc/67/report.html\">the committee said</a>, and was \u201clikely to take significant time to develop one\u201d.</p> <p>The former chief economist at Arup, Alexander Jan, has calculated that little more than \u00a3500,000 in annual revenue could be recouped from a Euston development. To pay for even a modest tunnel and station at, say, \u00a34bn would involve building the equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f043d86-e7ee-4bf1-87eb-0a8e5e2c263a\">21 Canary Wharf towers plus 80,000 homes</a>. Jan concludes that this would be \u201cabsurd\u201d. To get even a fraction of the needed revenue, an obscene wall of offices and luxury flats would need to rise over Regent\u2019s Park and Bloomsbury, obliterating the view of the City and St Paul\u2019s from Primrose Hill. For this to have emanated from Downing Street is the measure of how hard it is to take modern British government seriously.</p> <p>Continuing the tunnel to Euston, at an <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14022411/Rachel-Reeves-HS2-London-Euston-cost.html\">estimated cost of \u00a31bn</a>, makes sense only if Reeves is going to return something like Sunak\u2019s \u00a36.5bn to Euston. This is a huge sum \u2013 more than twice the \u00a33.1bn increase over two years in the NHS\u2019s capital budget announced this week. It will have to come either from other announced rail projects in the north \u2013 money promised by Sunak \u2013 or from elsewhere in her budget. In other words, it is either Primrose Hill or Manchester-to-Leeds and eat your heart out, levelling up.</p> <p>The rump HS2 to Birmingham has never been under serious budgetary control. We never get the full figures, and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c98486dzxnzo\">a recent BBC Panorama report</a> included a claim that some of those presented by HS2 to government were deliberately misleading. The transport department has always treated HS2 as too big to fail. And a measure of the project\u2019s political clout is that Keir Starmer\u2019s rail minister, responsible for HS2, is <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/minister-of-state--191\">Lord Hendy</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/07/09/keir-starmer-rail-minister-lord-hendy-fuels-hs2-hopes/\">rare HS2 champion</a> as the former chair of Network Rail. Meanwhile HS2\u2019s virtues are presumably to be vetted by the new Office of Value for Money, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/david-goldstone-cbe-appointed-as-independent-chair-of-the-office-for-value-for-money\">chaired by none other than David Goldstone</a>, who just happens to act as a non-executive director of HS2 Ltd as the Treasury\u2019s representative on the board. The whole affair is pure banana republic.</p> <p>At every critical stage in HS2\u2019s development, the sensible policy would have been to call a halt to what was David Cameron\u2019s silliest vanity project. The money could have been spent on a dozen transport projects more needed than knocking half an hour off a trip from London to Birmingham. Easing capacity at Waterloo and Paddington would make more sense than at Euston, as would improving the north\u2019s diabolical rail links.</p> <p>It would still be worthwhile to cancel HS2. Twelve years of planning has made not an ounce of difference to its poor value for money. Even Sunak\u2019s terminus at Old Oak Common would be reasonable. Haigh\u2019s claim that it would make \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/09/transport-secretary-extend-hs2-rail-line-euston\">absolutely no sense</a>\u201d to abandon Euston is like saying that every white elephant needs a tail.</p> <p>Old Oak Common will connect with London\u2019s new transit spine, the Elizabeth line, which Euston does not. More to the point, nearby Acton\u2019s derelict industrial acres are to become the Canary Wharf of the western metropolis, one of Europe\u2019s most dynamic \u201cnew towns\u201d. To link the Midlands to Acton rather than the British Museum and London zoo will one day seem perfectly reasonable. As it is, Britain\u2019s infrastructure planning seems as incompetent as ever.</p> <ul> <li><p>Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "The face said it all. As Rachel Reeves listed the infrastructure projects being funded by her first budget, she could not even say how much the biggest one would cost. She announced a \u00a322.6bn cash injection for the NHS in England over two years and an extra \u00a32.3bn a year in core funding for English schools. Television showed the relevant ministers cheering to the skies. But when she mentioned a certain railway tunnel from Old Oak Common to Euston in London, the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, was not cheering. We saw only a jaw tightening into what looked like a grimace. HS2, the greatest white elephant in British history, has lived to fight another day. Once costed at \u00a330bn and then soaring to \u00a3100bn, even stripped of its northern limbs it is currently expected to cost \u00a367bn. A year ago Rishi Sunak added himself to the list of shame of prime ministers who lacked the courage to kill it. But he did stop the building of the London link from Old Oak Common to Euston. The cost of the Euston terminus alone had ballooned from \u00a32.6bn to \u00a34.8bn. It was clearly out of control and the London end of the project was in effect banned. Winding up the work and securing the site was expected to cost a mind-blowing \u00a3200m. Two giant tunnelling machines now sit buried under Old Oak Common. Around them spread acres of desolation \u2013 of evicted families and flattened businesses. But at least it half made sense. Sunak could then redistribute the alleged \u00a36.5bn it would have cost to finish the project to urgently needed rail projects in the north. The only future Sunak could offer for Euston was that a private developer might step forward to pay for the tunnel and the new station out of the profits from the rest of the site. Since this seemed improbable, the assumption was that sooner or later, a government might have the wit to admit that it was all a ghastly mistake and return the Euston acres to the people of Camden. Last February the Commons\u2019 public accounts committee reviewed Sunak\u2019s decision on Euston. Its report made dire reading. It in effect dismissed the entire HS2 project as \u201cvery poor value for money\u201d. But it particularly remarked that his privatisation of Euston did not add up. Whitehall did not have \u201ca plausible or detailed proposition it could take to the market\u201d, the committee said, and was \u201clikely to take significant time to develop one\u201d. The former chief economist at Arup, Alexander Jan, has calculated that little more than \u00a3500,000 in annual revenue could be recouped from a Euston development. To pay for even a modest tunnel and station at, say, \u00a34bn would involve building the equivalent of 21 Canary Wharf towers plus 80,000 homes. Jan concludes that this would be \u201cabsurd\u201d. To get even a fraction of the needed revenue, an obscene wall of offices and luxury flats would need to rise over Regent\u2019s Park and Bloomsbury, obliterating the view of the City and St Paul\u2019s from Primrose Hill. For this to have emanated from Downing Street is the measure of how hard it is to take modern British government seriously. Continuing the tunnel to Euston, at an estimated cost of \u00a31bn, makes sense only if Reeves is going to return something like Sunak\u2019s \u00a36.5bn to Euston. This is a huge sum \u2013 more than twice the \u00a33.1bn increase over two years in the NHS\u2019s capital budget announced this week. It will have to come either from other announced rail projects in the north \u2013 money promised by Sunak \u2013 or from elsewhere in her budget. In other words, it is either Primrose Hill or Manchester-to-Leeds and eat your heart out, levelling up. The rump HS2 to Birmingham has never been under serious budgetary control. We never get the full figures, and a recent BBC Panorama report included a claim that some of those presented by HS2 to government were deliberately misleading. The transport department has always treated HS2 as too big to fail. And a measure of the project\u2019s political clout is that Keir Starmer\u2019s rail minister, responsible for HS2, is Lord Hendy, a rare HS2 champion as the former chair of Network Rail. Meanwhile HS2\u2019s virtues are presumably to be vetted by the new Office of Value for Money, chaired by none other than David Goldstone, who just happens to act as a non-executive director of HS2 Ltd as the Treasury\u2019s representative on the board. The whole affair is pure banana republic. At every critical stage in HS2\u2019s development, the sensible policy would have been to call a halt to what was David Cameron\u2019s silliest vanity project. The money could have been spent on a dozen transport projects more needed than knocking half an hour off a trip from London to Birmingham. Easing capacity at Waterloo and Paddington would make more sense than at Euston, as would improving the north\u2019s diabolical rail links. It would still be worthwhile to cancel HS2. Twelve years of planning has made not an ounce of difference to its poor value for money. Even Sunak\u2019s terminus at Old Oak Common would be reasonable. Haigh\u2019s claim that it would make \u201cabsolutely no sense\u201d to abandon Euston is like saying that every white elephant needs a tail. Old Oak Common will connect with London\u2019s new transit spine, the Elizabeth line, which Euston does not. More to the point, nearby Acton\u2019s derelict industrial acres are to become the Canary Wharf of the western metropolis, one of Europe\u2019s most dynamic \u201cnew towns\u201d. To link the Midlands to Acton rather than the British Museum and London zoo will one day seem perfectly reasonable. As it is, Britain\u2019s infrastructure planning seems as incompetent as ever.

All 15 have been beaten, including the \u201cIron Horse\u201d, Giant\u2019s Causeway, edged into second by the even grittier Tiznow in 2000, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/21/city-of-troy-smashes-york-track-record-to-join-juddmonte-international-legends-horse-racing-tips\">the trainer calls City Of Troy the \u201cbest I\u2019ve trained\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve tried a lot and we\u2019ve failed 100% of the time, so all we can do is learn from our weaknesses before and then hope that the horse is good enough to overcome the rest,\u201d O\u2019Brien says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying it because it is possible, but he is a three-year-old and a baby and has to cope with all the adjustments.\u201d</p> \n<p>In one sense, perhaps, it is possibly for the best that City Of Troy is oblivious to how much is riding on his final run before retiring to stud. The $3.6m (\u00a32.82m) prize for the Classic winner\u2019s connections is small beer compared to the likely effect on the stallion value of both City Of Troy and his own sire, Justify, the most recent winner of the US Triple Crown \u2013 on dirt \u2013 in 2018. That could run to eight figures a year for as long as they are both at stud, which should be another dozen years at least.</p> \n<p>O\u2019Brien has done all he can to prepare his horse for his first and last race on dirt this weekend but even then, he cannot be sure that City Of Troy will not recoil from the Classic challenge as Galileo himself did back in 2004.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe [City Of Troy] was always an aggressive horse from the gate and a high cruiser,\u201d the trainer said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Justify in him, and there\u2019s a lot of Galileo in him. I suppose the Galileo helps him to be as good on the grass as he is, and hopefully the Justify will help him to cope with the change.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Forever Young can foil Troy glory bid</h2> \n<p>No one can know for sure whether City Of Troy will respond to the take to the dirt at Del Mar on Saturday in the style of Arcangues, the only previous European-trained Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic winner on dirt, or Galileo, the 2001 Derby winner, who finished down the field.</p> \n<p>What is certain, though, is that City Of Troy will be about 131 points shorter in the betting, with British bookies at least, than Arcangues, whose 133-1 victory in 1993 remains the biggest shock in Classic history.</p> \n<p>Several firms claim to have seen significant backing for City Of Troy ante-post, but 15-8 still feels like a ridiculously defensive offer, which fails to account for the scale of the challenge facing Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s colt this weekend. Chelsea are only slightly shorter to win at Old Trafford on Sunday \u2013 a result that would surprise no one at all.</p> \n<p>Any hesitancy at the gate or reluctance to face the kickback could be fatal for City Of Troy\u2019s chance against seasoned rivals that know what to expect. So, while the heart would love to see City Of Troy head into retirement with an unprecedented Derby/Classic double to his name, the head says that he should not be such a clear favourite, and arguably not favourite, full stop.</p> \n<p>Fierceness, the Travers Stakes winner, is an obvious alternative but his failure to run to form in the intensity of the Kentucky Derby earlier in the year is a nagging concern. Sierra Leone, beaten a nose in the Kentucky Derby, is also a live runner, but the most convincing alternative is Japan\u2019s <strong>Forever Young (9.15pm)</strong>.</p> \n<p>He was another nose behind Sierra Leone in a three-way photo at Louisville, but that does not tell the whole story as the runner-up was leaning on Forever Young for most of the stretch.</p> \n<p>Had he had a clear run, Yoshito Yahagi\u2019s colt could well be going into the Classic unbeaten in seven starts, and his preparation since May has been structured entirely around Saturday\u2019s race.

      "bodyText": "Before there were international football teams, racehorses were proxies for national pride and aspirations. Gladiateur, the first French-bred winner of the Derby at Epsom in 1865, was dubbed \u201cthe avenger of Waterloo\u201d, and even now, there can be times when old habits die hard. At 14.41 Pacific Time on Saturday, 21.41GMT in London and Dublin and 05.41 Japan Standard Time tomorrowon Sunday morning in Tokyo, the attention of tens of millions of racing fans across the globe will focus on Del Mar in southern California for a two-minute horse race, as City Of Troy, this year\u2019s Derby winner, and 13 opponents go into the gates before the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic. It is a race of champions from three continents, and for City Of Troy, as tough an away fixture as they come. He is attempting to complete an unprecedented double: no winner of the Derby, on turf, has ever added the Classic, on dirt, to his CV. And he is the only runner in the field with no previous experience on the surface. The fierce pace, the kickback and the gate speed of his rivals will be a unique, unrelenting test from the off. There will be no chance to ease himself into the contest, no mid-race lull to fill up his lungs.

Ascot 1.30 Paul Nicholls\u2019s Samarrive has an absence to overcome but goes well fresh and has started to ease in the weights. Wetherby 1.50 Anything close to Luccia\u2019s Grade One form last year will make her very hard to beat. Ascot 2.05 Master Chewy was touched off in a Grade One on his final start last year and sets out on his second season over fences on a handy mark. Wetherby 2.22 An interesting switch back to hurdles for Twig, a winner first time up last season.

Ascot 3.15 Secret Squirrel has scope for further progress in handicaps this season and was a winner first time up last term.

On the positive side, investments in infrastructure and planning reforms should create a more business-friendly environment; an improved health service should help bring people back to work as current inactivity remains mainly linked to people who are off sick; and education and childcare investments should improve workers\u2019 skills in the long term. Nonetheless, reaping those potential benefits will also depend on whether the spending is deployed in an effective way.</p> </blockquote> <p>S&amp;P underlined that Reeves and Starmer have gambled on higher spending generating increased growth. If that does not happen it could prove tricky for the UK:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A hypothetical scenario in which public spending is permanently higher but the quality and accessibility of public services still doesn\u2019t improve enough, could further complicate policy trade-offs in the future.

      "bodyText": "Hurricanes and the enormous strike at Boeing were always going to be temporary factors in the US economy, but there are nevertheless signs of a \u201cslowing trend\u201d, according to economists. Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, said the data \u201cbolsters the case\u201d for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates at both its November and December meetings. After that, it depends on what happens on Tuesday... Tombs said: The muted rise in October payrolls is not merely due to strikes and the recent hurricanes. A further slowing in the trend looks likely given that hiring intentions of small businesses remain depressed, large businesses still face a rise in their borrowing costs as low-rate corporate bonds mature, and job openings in the health and education sector have fallen. August and September job gains were revised down by 112,000 jobs, and growth in job numbers slowed. Preston Caldwell, chief US economist at Morningstar, said: Even setting aside the October data, where the impact of temporary distortions is unknown, today\u2019s jobs report was a bit bearish. The data does point to an ongoing downtrend in job growth. [\u2026] There is nothing in the overall assemblage of labour market data to dissuade the Fed from cutting in next week\u2019s November meeting and to loosen policy further over the next year. The data overall points to a job market that has shed all of its post-pandemic tightness and excesses, and the data suggests enough downside risk to warrant nipping in the bud with monetary easing. In other business news today: The UK gilt market appeared to stablise after yields jumped on Thursday. HSBC chairman Mark Tucker gave his support to Rachel Reeves\u2019s budget. The UK manufacturing industry fell into contraction in October as companies paused investments ahead of the budget, according to the closely followed purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). Rating agencies gave their UK budget verdicts. Moody\u2019s said the UK government\u2019s increased borrowing will give an \u201cadditional challenge\u201d to the public finances, while S&amp;P Global said the UK government will be \u201cconstrained\u201d by its debt load. UK house price growth slowed in October ahead of Wednesday\u2019s budget, surprising economists who had expected faster increases, according to one of the key measures collected by a lender. Oil prices rose after reports that Iran is preparing an attack on Israel.

Please do join us next week as we strap in for the US election, and its fallout on financial markets. JJ The response from the business lobby to the UK budget was fairly negative, but criticism of the Labour government has not been universal. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has gained the backing of some senior bankers \u2013 perhaps cognisant that Labour is likely to be in power for at least five years. Mark Tucker, chairman of HSBC, said: This is a budget which lays the foundations for necessary investment within a framework of clear fiscal rules. The overall package strikes a balance between tax, spending and borrowing to finance public services, alongside a focus on delivering economic growth. Patrick Thomson, JP Morgan\u2019s chief executive of asset management in EMEA, said: The market reaction compared to the Truss mini-budget has been relatively muted and should count as a success considering the ambition of the Budget. It was helpful that there were few surprises, given that it was so well telegraphed ahead of time. Having raised taxes for much-needed investment in public infrastructure and services, the market will be waiting to see that the money is spent wisely in actually fixing any underlying problems in the economy to have long term impact. Ultimately, we all want to see how this translates into growth, and so the City will look to the forthcoming Mansion House speech for further detail on the proposed investments. British banks with big motor finance arms have had a dire week on stock markets since a court ruling that could cost them billions of pounds. The latest lender to join the procession of warnings was Secure Trust Bank. It had already said that it was looking at the ruling, but on Friday it worried the market further with a profit warning. Its share price is down by 17% today, adding to a dire run that has driven its valuation to its lowest since floating in 2012. The share price dropped from above \u00a38 a week ago to \u00a34.70 today. The bank said that it was taking longer than expected to recover money from people who had defaulted on loans, meaning that profit before tax would \u201cfall materially below market expectations by between \u00a310m and \u00a315m\u201d. David McCreadie, Secure Trust Bank\u2019s chief executive, said: We are disappointed that it will take longer than expected to recover value from the excess level of defaulted vehicle finance balances, and the recent court of appeal decisions have added additional uncertainty on the benefits to be realised in 2024. US stocks are all up by more than 1%, after weak jobs data appeared to remove any lingering chance of the Federal Reserve leaving interest rates on hold next week. The S&amp;P 500, the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones industrial average indices are all up by more than 1% in morning trading in New York. What have we learned from the US jobs numbers? It\u2019s tricky to say. Lara Castleton, US head of portfolio construction and strategy at Janus Henderson Investors, said it was \u201can underwhelming and muddying jobs report just five days before an election\u201d. There was no clear signal because of the hurricanes. There will likely not be much influence from this report on the results of next week nor on the Fed\u2019s interest rate decision later in the month, which will likely be 25-basis-points cut amidst this backdrop. James Knightley, chief international economist for the US at ING, an investment bank, said the number was \u201cdepressed by strike action and hurricane disruption\u201d. Nonetheless, the trend in hiring is obviously slowing and with the inflation backdrop looking less threatening, the Federal Reserve clearly has scope to move policy closer to neutral. Given the inflation backdrop is less threatening and the Fed is putting more emphasis on jobs, today\u2019s report cements expectations for a 25bp Fed rate cut next week. We expect that to be followed up by another 25bp rate cut in December. Wall Street has opened higher. Share prices were likely helped by expectations of looser monetary policy from the Federal Reserve after surprisingly weak jobs numbers. Here are the opening snaps, via Reuters: S&amp;P 500 UP 23.42 POINTS, OR 0.41%, AT 5,728.87 NASDAQ UP 93.71 POINTS, OR 0.52%, AT 18,188.86 DOW JONES UP 199.46 POINTS, OR 0.48%, AT 41,962.92 Back in the UK, the RMT union has suspended tube strikes due to start today after what it called a \u201csignificantly improved offer\u201d from Transport for London. Engineering staff represented by RMT were due to stop work for 24 hours from 6pm today. However, the separate Aslef union has not called off its action. Train operators and managerial employees are due to strike on 7 and 12 November. An RMT spokesperson said: Following intense negotiations with London Underground management and a significantly improved offer, we have suspended the strikes scheduled to start this evening. London Underground have sensibly abandoned their proposed changes to pay structures which now means all our members will receive the same value in any pay award. Further discussions will take place next week regarding the pay offer but progress has been made which would not have been possible without the fortitude and industrial strength of our 10,000 members on London Underground. *This post has been updated to reflect the fact that Aslef has not called off its strike action. The jobs numbers prompted a rapid fall in the yield on US Treasury bonds. The yield on the 10-year benchmark dropped 10 basis points (0.1 percentage points) in the immediate aftermath of the data. Perceptions of a weaker US economy will make the Federal Reserve more likely to lower interest rates next week. That would boost the relative value of bonds. (Yields dropping means prices are rising.) It\u2019s something of a side issue given the context of the US election, but the drop in yields has also affected UK debt. The yield on 10-year gilts has dropped below 4.4% \u2013 wiping out all of Thursday\u2019s post-budget move. The US dollar has weakened after the shock drop in non-farm payrolls. The dollar is down by 0.3% against a trade-weighted basket of currencies after initially climbing over the course of today. The pound is now up 0.5% today against the greenback, while the euro is up 0.1%. You can see the immediate reaction on this chart showing the performance of the dollar basket today: Economics professor Justin Wolfers of University of Michigan says that the underlying trend is of slower growth in jobs, but not a signal of a disastrous economic situation. But the headline is nevertheless still a long way below any recent readings thanks to the strikes and hurricanes. The US unemployment rate remained steady at 4.1%, but it is the non-farm payrolls number that will take up all the attention. Only 12,000 jobs were added \u2013 which will surely be seized on by Donald Trump in the last few days of campaigning ahead of the presidential election. A miss in the forecasts of that magnitude \u2013 more than 100,000 jobs \u2013 is rare. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) added the important caveat that the jobs reading is the first since Hurricanes Helene and Milton hit the US. The BLS said: It is likely that payroll employment estimates in some industries were affected by the hurricanes; however, it is not possible to quantify the net effect on the over-the-month change in national employment, hours, or earnings estimates because the establishment survey is not designed to isolate effects from extreme weather events. There was no discernible effect on the national unemployment rate from the household survey. It also added that \u201cEmployment declined in manufacturing due to strike activity\u201d \u2013 a reference to the ongoing strike at Boeing in particular. The US economy added far fewer jobs than expected in October, in a shock reading that will raise questions about its momentum days before the presidential election. Only 12,000 jobs were added in the month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, far below economists expectations of 113,000, and the 254,000 in September. Tens of millions of Americans have already voted, but we will shortly receive the last big economic update before the US presidential election next Tuesday: non-farm payrolls. The jobs numbers are a key measure of the US economy, but this month they could be affected by the huge strike at Boeing and the effects of a hurricane hitting Florida. Whatever the noise, the figures will help to set the narrative for the next day or two as the election campaign enters its most frantic stage. Bob Savage, head of markets strategy and insights at BNY Mellon, a US investment bank, said: US October non-farm payrolls expected 110,000 after 254,000 with hurricane and strike noise. The unemployment rate expected steady at 4.1% and the average hourly earnings flat at 4% year-on-year. Reuters\u2019s poll of economists suggests that the reading will be 113,000, down from 254,000 in September. A quick check-in on gilt markets: the Labour government will have been eyeing developments nervously after some movement this week, but so far on Friday things have been fairly steady. The yield on the UK 10-year bond has dropped to 4.42%, down from a high of 4.51% during London trading hours and two basis points (0.02 percentage points) below yesterday\u2019s close. Yields move inversely to prices, so falling yields is a sign of investors buying bonds, after Thursday\u2019s selloff. The 30-year yield has also dropped by a basis point, while the short-term two-year gilt is down four basis points in today\u2019s trading. The pound is up by 0.2% against the US dollar, and 0.3% against the euro. Shreyas Gopal, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, said that the budget should be net positive for the pound, because it will likely make the Bank of England more hawkish \u2013 more likely to keep interest rates higher for longer. Our economist\u2019s base case for next week is that the BoE now retains its language around cuts being \u201cgradual.\u201d Higher policy rates for longer, driven by a demand stimulus that lifts growth and inflation, ought to be positive for the pound in the current market environment. America\u2019s two oil giants reported combined profits of more than $13bn (\u00a310bn) for the third quarter as higher production volumes made up for weaker prices. ExxonMobil made $8.6bn, while Chevron made $4.5bn. Both beat analyst forecasts. ExxonMobil said it had produced the most oil for a quarter in over 40 years, at 3.2m barrels per day. Chevron said its oil output rose 7% compared with last year thanks to record production in the US, including the West Texas Permian Basin. Slower global economies have dragged down oil prices in recent months \u2013 despite the turmoil in the Middle East and Ukraine. That has hit oil company profits this year, but there is little sign of them slowing down. Both companies and their rivals have expanded production in the face of warnings from forecasters such as the International Energy Agency that exploration for new oil and gas wells must cease if the world is to hit climate targets to limit global heating to 2 degrees Celsius. Oil prices have risen by 2% after reports that Iran is preparing an attack on Israel. Futures prices for Brent crude oil, the North Sea benchmark, have risen by 1.9% to $74.22, while the North American equivalent, West Texas Intermediate, is up 2.1% to $70.73. US news website Axios reported that Iran was considering the strikes, citing Israeli officials. Investors have been watching the conflicts in the Middle East closely for anything that could mark the start of further escalation. So far Israel\u2019s wars against Hamas in Gaza and Lebanon have not directly affected oil production, for all the horrors of the losses of civilian lives. The UK manufacturing industry fell into contraction in October as companies paused investments ahead of the budget, according to the closely followed purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). The final reading for British manufacturing dropped to 49.9 points in October, according to S&amp;P Global, below the 50 index level that marks a contraction. The initial \u201cflash\u201d reading had been 50.3. It was the first time since April that manufacturing activity had contracted, S&amp;P said. Rob Dobson, director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: UK manufacturing started the final quarter of the year on an uncertain footing amid speculation on government policies ahead of the Budget, which was widely reported to have led to a wait-and-see approach on investment and spending. This domestic headwind, combined with an ongoing loss of export business, led to the first outright contraction in new work intakes since April. Output growth came close to stalling as a result. Another of the big three rating agencies has published its verdict on the UK budget: S&amp;P Global Ratings said that the UK\u2019s fiscal position is \u201cconstrained\u201d \u2013 but it also said that public investments \u2013 particularly in the health service \u2013 could create a \u201cmore business-friendly environment\u201d. The UK faces \u201celevated budgetary deficits and net general government debt level\u201d, S&amp;P said \u2013 although it did not raise its forecasts for budget deficits because it had already taken into account \u201clingering public spending pressures\u201d. Chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019s new fiscal rules gained the unusual backing of the International Monetary Fund this week, because they allow for increased investment. However, S&amp;P said that the rules presented \u201cmixed messages\u201d because they allowed for greater spending, but also that they are more credible on cutting future deficits because they require debt to be government debt to falling within three years. (Previous rules had a five-year timeframe, which meant governments could up load notional tax rises in the future, knowing they were unlikely to have to deal with it themselves.) The key test of success for Reeves will be growing the economy, S&amp;P said: The front-loading of spending will mechanically boost growth in the short term, but it\u2019s too early to tell how much this will add to potential output in the long term. On the positive side, investments in infrastructure and planning reforms should create a more business-friendly environment; an improved health service should help bring people back to work as current inactivity remains mainly linked to people who are off sick; and education and childcare investments should improve workers\u2019 skills in the long term. Nonetheless, reaping those potential benefits will also depend on whether the spending is deployed in an effective way. S&amp;P underlined that Reeves and Starmer have gambled on higher spending generating increased growth. If that does not happen it could prove tricky for the UK: A hypothetical scenario in which public spending is permanently higher but the quality and accessibility of public services still doesn\u2019t improve enough, could further complicate policy trade-offs in the future. Conversely, a faster improvement in public services could yield greater dividends in terms of lower future pressures and positive growth repercussions. The UK government\u2019s increased borrowing will give an \u201cadditional challenge\u201d to the public finances, according to influential rating agency Moody\u2019s. UK gilt yields, effectively the price at which the government can borrow, rose to their highest level this year on Thursday afternoon as markets responded to Rachel Reeves\u2019s budget \u2013 the first by a Labour government in 14 years. Investors were responding particularly to the prospect of about \u00a328bn in extra borrowing. Moody\u2019s said that the budget would not do much to boost UK economic growth, and that there was only a limited buffer if the country faces further financial shocks, in a further sign of the wariness of financial markets towards the government\u2019s plans. In a note sent to investors, reported by the Financial Times, Moody\u2019s said: In our view, the increase in borrowing, which is in part supported by a new measure of debt under the fiscal framework, will pose an additional challenge for what are already difficult fiscal consolidation prospects. [\u2026] Furthermore, the extent to which new investment spending can raise growth potential will be limited unless structural constraints are durably addressed which will prove difficult. Moody\u2019s is one of the three major ratings agencies, alongside S&amp;P and Fitch. Their economists are not privy to any special information or insight on sovereign debt, but their assessments tend to be influential among bond investors Changes to stamp duty by Rachel Reeves in the budget mean we should expect a rush of UK property transactions in the new year until the end of March, according to Nationwide. That will probably be followed by a period with fewer transactions in the months afterwards. The chancellor\u2019s decision to remove the temporary increase to the nil rate for stamp duty next April could spark a rush to complete purchases before the changes. In September 2022, the government temporarily increased the nil rate of stamp duty, the amount before you have to start paying stamp duty on a purchase, for homebuyers, raising the nil rate for first-time buyers from \u00a3300,000 to \u00a3450,000, and for those buying an additional home from \u00a3125,000 to \u00a3250,000. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: The main impact of the stamp duty changes is likely to be on the timing of property transactions, as purchasers aim to ensure their house purchases complete before the tax change takes effect. This will lead to a jump in transactions in the first three months of 2025 (especially March), and a corresponding period of weakness in the following three to six months, as occurred in the wake of previous stamp duty changes. The biggest mover on the FTSE 100 this morning is Reckitt Benckiser, the maker of products ranging from Dettol to Strepsils. Reckitt\u2019s shares are up 10% after a US court ruling boosted its baby formula subsidiary, Mead Johnson. Here\u2019s the Reuters report on the ruling from last night: Abbott and Reckitt unit Mead Johnson are not responsible for a young boy\u2019s debilitating intestinal disease, a jury found on Thursday in a lawsuit accusing them of failing to warn of their premature baby formulas\u2019 risks, a victory for the two companies following large losses in similar trials. At the five-week trial in St. Louis, Missouri state court, lawyers for plaintiff Kaine Whitfield had urged jurors to award more than $6.2 billion. The lawsuit, brought on Kaine\u2019s behalf by his mother, Elizabeth Whitfield, alleged that the companies failed to warn that their specialized formulas used by newborn intensive care units in hospitals could cause necrotizing enterocolitis, a disease that almost exclusively affects premature infants and has an estimated mortality rate of more than 20%. The UK\u2019s chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, has said that the UK is seeing a normal market response to the budget, after the \u201cPTSD\u201d from the chaos following Liz Truss\u2019s 2022 \u201cmini-budget\u201d. Asked about the market response to the budget, the Jones told Sky News that \u201cmarkets always respond to budgets in the normal way\u201d. There\u2019s a lot of new information about the economy and the nation\u2019s finances presented to Parliament, and it\u2019s normal for markets to respond. I think we\u2019ve all got PTSD from Liz Truss and just let\u2019s compare the two different scenarios, because they\u2019re very, very different: So, under Liz Truss, as we saw, they sacked permanent secretary, they ignored the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. They announced \u00a345bn of unfunded tax cuts and said they were only just getting started. And then the market went mad and we all know what happened. Completely different in contrast to now. Stock markets across Europe have gained ground. The FTSE 100 in London is up by 0.4%. Here are the opening snaps from across the rest of Europe: EUROPE\u2019S STOXX 600 UP 0.1% GERMANY\u2019S DAX FLAT FRANCE\u2019S CAC 40 UP 0.2%; SPAIN\u2019S IBEX UP 0.1% EURO STOXX INDEX UP 0.1%; EURO ZONE BLUE CHIPS UP 0.1% As trading in London has opened, yields on the UK 10-year and the 30-year have risen by about four basis points (0.04 percentage points) apiece. But they still remain just below the high for the year hit on Thursday. That left the 10-year gilt at 4.477%, and the 30-year at 4.913%. Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets. UK house price growth slowed in October ahead of Wednesday\u2019s budget, surprising economists who had expected faster increases, according to one of the key measures collected by a lender. House prices grew by 0.1% in October, according to the Nationwide building society. That was less than the 0.3% rate that economists polled by Reuters. The annual rate of growth slowed from 3.2% in September to 2.4% in October, below the 2.8% expected by economists. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: Housing market activity has remained relatively resilient in recent months, with the number of mortgage approvals approaching the levels seen pre-pandemic, despite the significantly higher interest rate environment. UK debt yields revisit year high after budget UK bond yields once more touched their highest point this year on Friday, as investors continued to digest the implications of the first Labour budget in 14 years. The yield \u2013 effectively the UK government\u2019s borrowing cost \u2013 on the benchmark 10-year bond reached 4.526% in global trading on Friday, matching the level hit on Thursday in the aftermath of Rachel Reeves\u2019s budget statement as investors predicted a slower pace of interest rate cuts from the Bank of England. Since then it has fallen back slightly to 4.456%. Scrutiny of bond market movements has been particularly intense after the budget because of the large borrowing set out by Reeves, alongside major tax increases. However, while there has been a noticeable reaction in the market for UK government bonds, also known as gilts, it has not so far been comparable to the turmoil following the budget of Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng in 2022. The below chart shows the UK 10-year gilt yield over the last three months: yields (which move inversely to prices) have risen appreciably, but the post-budget movements have not been dramatic. We will update throughout the day on movements.

Daylight is limited, most plants are hiding underground, wilting poinsettias are everywhere and, all too frequently, naff gifts are picked out at those sprawling garden centre emporiums. Non-gardeners can\u2019t always be blamed for getting it so wrong: gardening can be a particularly personal hobby, and only the well-versed are to know just how useful a mattock can be. So, let us gardeners share our dream gifts for the green-fingered in your life this year. After all, who would argue with Monty? * * * The ultimate watering can The Warley Fall watering can, \u00a3175 haws.co.uk I would love a traditional Haws watering can in racing green. They\u2019ve been handcrafted in the UK for more than 130 years, and are the ultimate gift.

These ones are excellent: light enough to do the job but still protective. And unlike the flowery gloves, it doesn\u2019t matter if the grey ones get dirty. Jo Thompson, designer and writer, The Gardening Mind * * * Work jacket Norfolk work jacket, \u00a3130 carriercompany.co.uk Norfolk-based Carrier Company consistently charms me with its workwear, which blends design and functionality. The ticking jacket is a wardrobe hero. Hazel Gardiner, botanical designer, writer and broadcaster * * * Gardening knife Higonokami folding knife, \u00a336 niwaki.com A quality gardening knife is an indispensable part of my kit for harvesting. Making sharp cuts is crucial to avoid tears and the introduction of disease. Claire Ratinon, organic food grower and writer * * * Terrariums Terrariums voucher, from \u00a310 londonterrariums.com During the winter months when we spend less time in the garden, having a self-contained and sustained ecosystem indoors tops up our connection with nature. And what\u2019s more fun than building one yourself? This voucher can be put towards a ready-made terrarium, workshop or plant.

Or you can become a friend at our charitable project in Serge Hill, for events, tours and more. Tom Stuart-Smith, landscape architect and garden designer * * * The best secateurs Kurumi secateurs, \u00a3169 niwaki.com Expensive, but a joy to use and worth every penny. Monty Don, gardener, broadcaster and writer * * * Japanese pruning saw Folding saw, \u00a339 \u00a339 at niwaki.com Japanese saws (like Japanese ladders) have revolutionised pruning.

They have had an offer accepted on a bigger house in Norwich for their growing family and are nervous it could send mortgage rates higher. The jury is still out after UK government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/31/uks-borrowing-costs-rise-as-reevess-budget-prompts-fears-of-slower-interest-rate-cuts\">borrowing costs rose</a> in the budget\u2019s wake.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m constantly checking websites to see the latest rates,\u201d says Jon, mindful of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/22/this-is-ruining-peoples-lives-homeowners-hit-by-uk-mortgage-crisis-speak-out\">the mortgage meltdown</a> during Liz Truss\u2019s brief reign.</p>    <p>With no outside space in their current home for the children to play in, the couple are moving to a semi-detached house with a garden and prized off-street parking. It is a mile away from where they are now and a \u201cmanageable doer-upper\u201d that will test Jon\u2019s DIY skills, including an ambitious plan to fit a new kitchen.</p> <p>His pay rise helped them to secure a bigger home loan but the couple have not \u201cmaxed out\u201d their borrowing. In an uncertain property market their below-asking price \u00a3325,000 offer was accepted, while their three-bed terrace was eagerly snapped up at the asking price by first-time buyers. The move is pencilled in for February.</p> <p>With two kids and a cat called Polly, the couple in their 30s are a good proxy for many in Britain. \u201cI saw a statistic that our pay equates to the average household income with two earners, and that the house we\u2019re buying is around the average price, too,\u201d Jon says.</p> <p>\u201cI know that for a lot of people on average wages like us, buying the average house is impossible,\u201d he says. They got on the ladder with the help of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/13/bank-of-mum-and-dad-uk-inequality-pounds-transfer-children-ifs\">bank of mum and dad</a>, and without the equity built up over seven years \u201cthere\u2019s no way we could afford this new house\u201d, he says.</p>    <p>They have a mortgage rate offer at just under 4% and the sums show monthly payments increasing by about \u00a3450 to \u00a31,100 a month after the move. It\u2019s a big step up but Jess points out it would be hard to find anywhere for a family to rent in Norwich for less than that amount.</p> <p>\u201cWith Jess being on mat leave, we are budgeting for quite a tight 2025,\u201d Jon says. \u201cThe last few months of her leave are unpaid and will coincide with higher mortgage repayments and the renovation costs.\u201d</p> <p>After their mortgage another big outlay is childcare. With their eldest child, Robin, they missed out on the <a href=\"https://educationhub.blog.gov.uk/2023/03/16/budget-2023-everything-you-need-to-know-about-childcare-support/\">30 hours of free childcare</a> a week that is promised to working parents of all children over the age of nine months from 2025. But when April goes to nursery next year this will make a massive difference.</p> <p>\u201cWe still have childcare to pay for but it\u2019s not going to be anywhere near the financial burden that it was when we had Robin,\u201d Jess says. \u201cFor those two years from age one to three it was a huge chunk of our income. At its highest, it was about \u00a3475 a month and that was with help from our family.\u201d The cost is now \u00a3200 as even with an extra half-day, after turning three Robin qualified for government-funded hours.</p>    <p>Pretty much everything has gone up in price over the past three years, from utilities, food, petrol and insurance to Polly\u2019s vet bills. Expensive is the new normal, Jess says. In September, headline inflation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/16/uk-inflation-bank-of-england-interest-rates\">fell below 2%</a> for the first time since 2021 (it had been on a downward trajectory since hitting a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/16/uk-inflation-rate-energy-price-rises\">peak of 11.1% in October 2022</a>) but there is always something. They just forked out \u00a3300 to get their Nissan Note through its MOT and know they will have to buy a bigger car soon.</p> <p>Grocery price inflation peaked at 17.5% in 2021 and is now running at 2% but outliers remain. Olive oil, for example, now costs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/01/uk-shop-prices-fall-at-fastest-rate-since-2021-despite-rising-fresh-food-inflation\">more than \u00a39.12 a litre</a>, with prices up 42% year on year, according to official data. After all the shocks, Jess says their \u201coutgoings have levelled off. It\u2019s more predictable.\u201d</p> <p>With two young children there are not many nights or even meals out. \u201cWe went to Pizza Express not long before April was born, and it cost us 70 or 80 quid,\u201d Jess says. \u201cI was really shocked at how much it had gone up in price because it had been such a long time since we\u2019d gone out for a meal.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/11/inflation-sep2024/giv-4559IkpmfoFMCVdX/\" data-alt=\"UK inflation chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/11/inflation-sep2024/giv-4559IkpmfoFMCVdX/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Energy bills have since eased from their peak in 2023 \u2013 when the Ofgem price cap reached \u00a34,279 but the government subsidised bills to keep them at \u00a32,500. The current cap is still \u00a31,717 a year but it is possible to find a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/oct/26/save-100-or-more-by-switching-energy-tariffs-say-experts\">cheaper deal</a>. In the spring the Dalys secured a 12-month fix with British Gas.</p> <p>At its zenith the energy bill for their three-bed terrace home was just over \u00a3200 a month but they report that with the \u201cfix\u201d it is now \u00a3104. It is a big improvement but not back to pre-crisis levels. In 2019 their direct debit was only \u00a345.</p> <p>A Labour government brought optimism to many households even if no one is predicting living standards will take off. Indeed, the<strong> </strong>grim prediction is the budget\u2019s policies will leave the average family \u00a3770 a year worse off in real terms in five years\u2019 time, according to<strong> </strong>the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m hopeful Labour will better protect the public services that as a family we\u2019re going to rely on,\u201d says Jess, adding that \u201cit is a bit early to tell\u201d.</p>",

They got on the ladder with the help of the bank of mum and dad, and without the equity built up over seven years \u201cthere\u2019s no way we could afford this new house\u201d, he says. They have a mortgage rate offer at just under 4% and the sums show monthly payments increasing by about \u00a3450 to \u00a31,100 a month after the move. It\u2019s a big step up but Jess points out it would be hard to find anywhere for a family to rent in Norwich for less than that amount. \u201cWith Jess being on mat leave, we are budgeting for quite a tight 2025,\u201d Jon says. \u201cThe last few months of her leave are unpaid and will coincide with higher mortgage repayments and the renovation costs.\u201d After their mortgage another big outlay is childcare. With their eldest child, Robin, they missed out on the 30 hours of free childcare a week that is promised to working parents of all children over the age of nine months from 2025. But when April goes to nursery next year this will make a massive difference. \u201cWe still have childcare to pay for but it\u2019s not going to be anywhere near the financial burden that it was when we had Robin,\u201d Jess says. \u201cFor those two years from age one to three it was a huge chunk of our income. At its highest, it was about \u00a3475 a month and that was with help from our family.\u201d The cost is now \u00a3200 as even with an extra half-day, after turning three Robin qualified for government-funded hours. Pretty much everything has gone up in price over the past three years, from utilities, food, petrol and insurance to Polly\u2019s vet bills. Expensive is the new normal, Jess says. In September, headline inflation fell below 2% for the first time since 2021 (it had been on a downward trajectory since hitting a peak of 11.1% in October 2022) but there is always something. They just forked out \u00a3300 to get their Nissan Note through its MOT and know they will have to buy a bigger car soon. Grocery price inflation peaked at 17.5% in 2021 and is now running at 2% but outliers remain. Olive oil, for example, now costs more than \u00a39.12 a litre, with prices up 42% year on year, according to official data. After all the shocks, Jess says their \u201coutgoings have levelled off. It\u2019s more predictable.\u201d With two young children there are not many nights or even meals out. \u201cWe went to Pizza Express not long before April was born, and it cost us 70 or 80 quid,\u201d Jess says. \u201cI was really shocked at how much it had gone up in price because it had been such a long time since we\u2019d gone out for a meal.\u201d Energy bills have since eased from their peak in 2023 \u2013 when the Ofgem price cap reached \u00a34,279 but the government subsidised bills to keep them at \u00a32,500. The current cap is still \u00a31,717 a year but it is possible to find a cheaper deal. In the spring the Dalys secured a 12-month fix with British Gas. At its zenith the energy bill for their three-bed terrace home was just over \u00a3200 a month but they report that with the \u201cfix\u201d it is now \u00a3104. It is a big improvement but not back to pre-crisis levels. In 2019 their direct debit was only \u00a345. A Labour government brought optimism to many households even if no one is predicting living standards will take off. Indeed, the grim prediction is the budget\u2019s policies will leave the average family \u00a3770 a year worse off in real terms in five years\u2019 time, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful Labour will better protect the public services that as a family we\u2019re going to rely on,\u201d says Jess, adding that \u201cit is a bit early to tell\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Before Carlos Alcaraz dismounted from the podium after his post-match interview in the final of the Six Kings Slam exhibition event in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia earlier this month, the most accomplished young male tennis player in the world had one more thing to say. Alcaraz took the microphone from the MC, Andrew Castle, and turned to his left.</p> <p>\u201cI just want to say thank you to his excellency for making this event possible,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cI enjoyed it a lot. Last year, when I came here, this year with the best players in the world. Thank you very much for everything you have done for tennis, to bring it to the kingdom.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/01/jack-draper-paris-katie-boulter\">Katie Boulter sees off Zakharova to reach Hong Kong semi-finals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alcaraz was addressing Turki Alalshikh, the powerful chair of Saudi Arabia\u2019s General Entertainment Authority and an adviser to the royal family. An architect of the Riyadh Season festival, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/may/14/saudi-arabia-boxing-fury-usyk-riyadh\">Alalshikh is responsible for the attraction of countless sports</a> and entertainment superstars from around the world to Saudi Arabia. Although Alalshikh has amassed significant power and popularity for his work, he is not a member of the Saudi royal family. It was notable that Alcaraz opted to address Alalshikh using his ostentatious honorific title.</p> <p>While this may have simply been a sincere reflection of Alcaraz\u2019s gratitude after an enjoyable and lucrative week, between similarly pointed statements from others and the intense social media promotion from all six players throughout the event, it was hard not to think of an even greater sporting superstar, Lionel Messi.</p>    <p>Last year, the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/18/sports/soccer/lionel-messi-saudi-arabia.html\">revealed</a> that Messi\u2019s tourism contract with Saudi Arabia includes a clause affirming that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/15/lionel-messi-saudi-arabia-tourism-deal-mls-inter-miami\">he cannot say anything to \u201ctarnish\u201d the kingdom</a>; money exchanged for his guaranteed silence. In recent years athletes have been deftly utilised to promote the kingdom as it attempts to augment its image and amplify its power in the region while defying criticism of its human rights record. It is difficult to know where authentic beliefs end and carefully choreographed propaganda begins.</p> <p>Throughout this year, Saudi Arabia has moved into tennis like never before. Rafael Nadal has taken up a lucrative role as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2024/jan/20/sport-cant-afford-to-look-away-from-damage-done-by-deals-with-saudi-arabia\">an ambassador to the Saudi Tennis Federation</a>. The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and Women\u2019s Tennis Association (WTA) initiated strategic partnerships with the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. Their player rankings are now officially branded the PIF ATP Rankings and PIF WTA Rankings. PIF\u2019s logo is present on the advertising boards and around the grounds on the tour.</p> <p>After the criticism and friction that followed Saudi Arabia\u2019s early attempts to enter other sports, the speed with which it has cut through tennis underlines how quickly attitudes have changed. And by far the most significant tennis event yet in Saudi Arabia begins on Saturday with the WTA Finals, the flagship event of the WTA that pits the best eight players in the world against each other.

      "bodyText": "Before Carlos Alcaraz dismounted from the podium after his post-match interview in the final of the Six Kings Slam exhibition event in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia earlier this month, the most accomplished young male tennis player in the world had one more thing to say. Alcaraz took the microphone from the MC, Andrew Castle, and turned to his left. \u201cI just want to say thank you to his excellency for making this event possible,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cI enjoyed it a lot. Last year, when I came here, this year with the best players in the world. Thank you very much for everything you have done for tennis, to bring it to the kingdom.\u201d Alcaraz was addressing Turki Alalshikh, the powerful chair of Saudi Arabia\u2019s General Entertainment Authority and an adviser to the royal family. An architect of the Riyadh Season festival, Alalshikh is responsible for the attraction of countless sports and entertainment superstars from around the world to Saudi Arabia. Although Alalshikh has amassed significant power and popularity for his work, he is not a member of the Saudi royal family. It was notable that Alcaraz opted to address Alalshikh using his ostentatious honorific title. While this may have simply been a sincere reflection of Alcaraz\u2019s gratitude after an enjoyable and lucrative week, between similarly pointed statements from others and the intense social media promotion from all six players throughout the event, it was hard not to think of an even greater sporting superstar, Lionel Messi. Last year, the New York Times revealed that Messi\u2019s tourism contract with Saudi Arabia includes a clause affirming that he cannot say anything to \u201ctarnish\u201d the kingdom; money exchanged for his guaranteed silence. In recent years athletes have been deftly utilised to promote the kingdom as it attempts to augment its image and amplify its power in the region while defying criticism of its human rights record. It is difficult to know where authentic beliefs end and carefully choreographed propaganda begins. Throughout this year, Saudi Arabia has moved into tennis like never before. Rafael Nadal has taken up a lucrative role as an ambassador to the Saudi Tennis Federation. The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and Women\u2019s Tennis Association (WTA) initiated strategic partnerships with the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. Their player rankings are now officially branded the PIF ATP Rankings and PIF WTA Rankings. PIF\u2019s logo is present on the advertising boards and around the grounds on the tour. After the criticism and friction that followed Saudi Arabia\u2019s early attempts to enter other sports, the speed with which it has cut through tennis underlines how quickly attitudes have changed. And by far the most significant tennis event yet in Saudi Arabia begins on Saturday with the WTA Finals, the flagship event of the WTA that pits the best eight players in the world against each other. While the kingdom has already hosted a limited number of smaller international women\u2019s sporting events, particularly golf, the WTA Finals is the most important women\u2019s event in Saudi Arabia and it begins its first year of a three-year deal in Riyadh. Inevitable as the arrangement may have appeared, the WTA\u2019s arrival in Saudi Arabia is particularly significant, underlining the unique appeal of tennis as one of the biggest women\u2019s sports in the world, which the kingdom can use to support its claims of reformed women\u2019s rights. Still, the LGBTQ+ community continues to face significant repression, male guardianship laws remain in place and women\u2019s rights activists, such as Manahel al-Otaibi and Salma al-Shehab, are subject to lengthy jail times on terrorism-related offences for simply supporting women\u2019s rights on social media. As the likes of Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek convene in Riyadh to battle for one of the most important titles in the world, the stakes are high for this edition of an event that has been in disarray in recent years. Despite agreeing a 10-year deal to host the event in Shenzhen from 2019, that contract was dissolved in the aftermath of the former doubles No 1 Peng Shuai accusing the former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual coercion. After Peng disappeared from public view, the WTA initially affirmed that it would not return to China until it could directly communicate with her. In the end, the tour opted to return to China last year. Meanwhile, the WTA Finals has moved from city to city, culminating in last year\u2019s disaster in Canc\u00fan, where players were forced to compete in horrendous windy, wet conditions during hurricane season. There will never be anything like it again. Since the Finals plays a significant role in the WTA\u2019s finances, recent editions of the events also ravaged the tour\u2019s coffers. This year\u2019s prize money pool of $15.25m (\u00a312m) is equal to the offerings of the ATP Finals in Turin. The WTA has gone through significant changes since CVC Capital Partners bought a 20% stake in the organisation for $150m last year. This year\u2019s Finals are the first for the new chief executive, Portia Archer, who joined in May from the NBA\u2019s G League and all eyes of the tennis world will be on Riyadh.",

The RMT said it had suspended its planned week-long action, which had been due to begin on Friday evening, after receiving a significantly improved pay offer from tube bosses. Aslef, the train drivers\u2019 union, has yet to call off plans for a highly disruptive strike by tube drivers next Thursday and another the following Tuesday, but the Guardian understands it will meet London Underground on Monday for talks. Transport for London urged the union to take a cue from its fellow union and call off the action. A spokesperson for the RMT, whose members include signalling and station staff, said: \u201cLondon Underground have sensibly abandoned their proposed changes to pay structures, which now means all our members will receive the same value in any pay award. \u201cFurther discussions will take place next week regarding the pay offer but progress has been made which would not have been possible without the fortitude and industrial strength of our 10,000 members on London Underground.\u201d Before the strike was called off, RMT maintenance staff had been due to strike for 24 hours from Friday evening.

Driver and management staff members at Aslef are still on course to walk out on 7 and 12 November, with TfL warning that no service is set to run on these days.

An Aslef strike planned for May was called off in April after the union said a TfL proposal resolved the key issues in the dispute.

      "body": "<p>Here\u2019s one prediction about the US election you can take to the bank. When the result is finally known, there will be a stampede of experts and prognosticators rushing to insist that, in effect, they knew it all along \u2013 that, hard though it was to glimpse through the fog of polls and shifting data, the eventual outcome was obvious. Even inevitable.</p> \n<p>That will be truer still if, when the voters\u2019 will is finally known, it turns out not to have been so close after all, with one of the two main candidates sweeping most of the swing states to rack up a healthy majority in the electoral college if not the popular vote.</p> \n<p>The funny thing is, if that happens \u2013 for either candidate \u2013 it would not entirely be a surprise. Even now, you can sketch out, in advance, a very plausible case for why Donald Trump could be about to retake the presidency. And you can do the same for why Harris might be on the brink of becoming the first woman to hold the world\u2019s most powerful office. So, much as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/16/secret-boris-johnson-column-favoured-uk-remaining-in-eu\">Boris Johnson drafted two columns</a> on the eve of the Brexit referendum \u2013 one advocating leave, the other remain \u2013 here, while the US\u2019s verdict is still unknown, is the story of how Trump, or Harris, pulled it off.</p> \n<p>Start with the scenario of a victorious Trump. To understand it might require a single number: 28. That\u2019s the percentage of Americans who tell pollsters they believe the country is on the right track. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/two-thirds-voters-say-country-wrong-track-ahead-2024-election-rcna172873\">A measly 28%</a>. In that environment, incumbent parties lose. And, for all the drama and buzz of her swift installation as candidate, her positioning as the face of change, Harris is a member of the incumbent party and a senior figure in the current US government. A nation that made clear long ago that it wanted to fire Joe Biden, largely over the cost of living and rising prices, as well as immigration, was bound to seize the chance to do the next best thing \u2013 and reject his deputy.</p> \n<p>If there was a way to avoid that fate, it would have required Harris to make a cleaner break from Biden than she was willing to. Whether it was personal respect for the man, or fear of rupturing her coalition, she didn\u2019t do what had to be done. In this narrative, a key moment will prove to be her October appearance on The View, when she was asked if, looking back over the past four years, she would have done anything differently from her boss. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/news/not-a-thing-that-comes-to-mind-harris-says-she-wouldnt-do-anything-differently-from-biden-over-past-four-years/\">Not a thing that comes to mind</a>,\u201d was her answer. At a stroke, she robbed herself of the mantle of change, and confirmed Trump\u2019s core message: vote Harris, get Biden 2. </p> \n<p>Should the need arise to explain a Trump win in 2024, incumbency in tough times will be the meat of it. But it won\u2019t be the whole story. Other factors, besides inflation and petrol prices, will have played their part, tied more to culture than politics. Trump\u2019s astonishing lead among men, especially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2024/oct/25/i-visited-jd-vances-hometown-heres-what-i-learned-about-young-male-voters\">those without a college degree</a> \u2013 including some, albeit qualified, evidence of increased support among<strong> </strong>Black and Hispanic men, previously beyond the reach of the Republican party \u2013 points to an element of Trump\u2019s appeal that has endured for nearly a decade. Call it cultural defiance. It sees the wagging finger of all those who sit in judgment \u2013 whether that\u2019s the media, the universities, the \u201cwoke\u201d, foreign countries, especially European ones, or at its most loosely defined, women, especially educated women \u2013 and shows them a big, fat middle finger in response.</p> \n<p>This is what Trump\u2019s critics took so long to understand. What, for years, they thought would hurt him \u2013 scandal, two impeachments, multiple criminal prosecutions and convictions \u2013 only made him stronger, confirming him as an outlaw, a transgressor who crossed the very boundaries so many of his followers, chiefly men, itched to cross with him. That photo of him, bloodstained, seconds after dodging an assassin\u2019s bullet, urging his devotees to \u201cfight, fight, fight!\u201d \u2013 how, we may come to ask, did we ever think he could be beaten after that?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"30c47e86-d026-49f3-a3f9-44683ac6bb06\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MH2yL5cLvyo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>After all, Harris was his ideal opponent. A liberal, accomplished, affluent woman from California, an avatar for the very cultural elite he and many millions of others despise. In case that impression of her were not sharp enough, she reinforced it with a parade of A-list stars campaigning for her in the final stretch, repeating the same mistake Hillary Clinton made in 2016.</p> \n<p>Finally, given that the US has hardly cured itself of racism or misogyny, it should not be a shock if, in the coming days, we see that a Black woman could not get elected to the White House. It may be 2024, but perhaps the US is still not ready.</p> \n<p>So much for a Trump win. How will we explain victory for Harris, if it comes? The answer may boil down to one word: women. Outraged by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/24/roe-v-wade-overturned-abortion-summary-supreme-court\">the supreme court\u2019s Dobbs ruling</a>, overturning abortion rights in 2022, women confounded the pollsters in that year\u2019s midterm elections: there was no Republican red wave, despite soaring inflation, because women came out in big numbers to prevent it. Success in 2024 would mean that, once again, and with an intensity missed by most surveys, women in the US had quietly resolved to do the exact same thing to the man who shaped the supreme court, Dobbs\u2019s ultimate<em> </em>author: Trump.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/30/bernie-sanders-israel-gaza-harris-trump\">How can I vote for Kamala Harris if she supports Israel\u2019s war?

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s one prediction about the US election you can take to the bank. When the result is finally known, there will be a stampede of experts and prognosticators rushing to insist that, in effect, they knew it all along \u2013 that, hard though it was to glimpse through the fog of polls and shifting data, the eventual outcome was obvious. Even inevitable. That will be truer still if, when the voters\u2019 will is finally known, it turns out not to have been so close after all, with one of the two main candidates sweeping most of the swing states to rack up a healthy majority in the electoral college if not the popular vote. The funny thing is, if that happens \u2013 for either candidate \u2013 it would not entirely be a surprise. Even now, you can sketch out, in advance, a very plausible case for why Donald Trump could be about to retake the presidency. And you can do the same for why Harris might be on the brink of becoming the first woman to hold the world\u2019s most powerful office. So, much as Boris Johnson drafted two columns on the eve of the Brexit referendum \u2013 one advocating leave, the other remain \u2013 here, while the US\u2019s verdict is still unknown, is the story of how Trump, or Harris, pulled it off. Start with the scenario of a victorious Trump. To understand it might require a single number: 28. That\u2019s the percentage of Americans who tell pollsters they believe the country is on the right track. A measly 28%. In that environment, incumbent parties lose. And, for all the drama and buzz of her swift installation as candidate, her positioning as the face of change, Harris is a member of the incumbent party and a senior figure in the current US government. A nation that made clear long ago that it wanted to fire Joe Biden, largely over the cost of living and rising prices, as well as immigration, was bound to seize the chance to do the next best thing \u2013 and reject his deputy. If there was a way to avoid that fate, it would have required Harris to make a cleaner break from Biden than she was willing to. Whether it was personal respect for the man, or fear of rupturing her coalition, she didn\u2019t do what had to be done. In this narrative, a key moment will prove to be her October appearance on The View, when she was asked if, looking back over the past four years, she would have done anything differently from her boss. \u201cNot a thing that comes to mind,\u201d was her answer. At a stroke, she robbed herself of the mantle of change, and confirmed Trump\u2019s core message: vote Harris, get Biden 2. Should the need arise to explain a Trump win in 2024, incumbency in tough times will be the meat of it. But it won\u2019t be the whole story. Other factors, besides inflation and petrol prices, will have played their part, tied more to culture than politics. Trump\u2019s astonishing lead among men, especially those without a college degree \u2013 including some, albeit qualified, evidence of increased support among Black and Hispanic men, previously beyond the reach of the Republican party \u2013 points to an element of Trump\u2019s appeal that has endured for nearly a decade. Call it cultural defiance. It sees the wagging finger of all those who sit in judgment \u2013 whether that\u2019s the media, the universities, the \u201cwoke\u201d, foreign countries, especially European ones, or at its most loosely defined, women, especially educated women \u2013 and shows them a big, fat middle finger in response. This is what Trump\u2019s critics took so long to understand. What, for years, they thought would hurt him \u2013 scandal, two impeachments, multiple criminal prosecutions and convictions \u2013 only made him stronger, confirming him as an outlaw, a transgressor who crossed the very boundaries so many of his followers, chiefly men, itched to cross with him. That photo of him, bloodstained, seconds after dodging an assassin\u2019s bullet, urging his devotees to \u201cfight, fight, fight!\u201d \u2013 how, we may come to ask, did we ever think he could be beaten after that? After all, Harris was his ideal opponent. A liberal, accomplished, affluent woman from California, an avatar for the very cultural elite he and many millions of others despise. In case that impression of her were not sharp enough, she reinforced it with a parade of A-list stars campaigning for her in the final stretch, repeating the same mistake Hillary Clinton made in 2016. Finally, given that the US has hardly cured itself of racism or misogyny, it should not be a shock if, in the coming days, we see that a Black woman could not get elected to the White House. It may be 2024, but perhaps the US is still not ready. So much for a Trump win. How will we explain victory for Harris, if it comes? The answer may boil down to one word: women. Outraged by the supreme court\u2019s Dobbs ruling, overturning abortion rights in 2022, women confounded the pollsters in that year\u2019s midterm elections: there was no Republican red wave, despite soaring inflation, because women came out in big numbers to prevent it. Success in 2024 would mean that, once again, and with an intensity missed by most surveys, women in the US had quietly resolved to do the exact same thing to the man who shaped the supreme court, Dobbs\u2019s ultimate author: Trump. In that sense, and others, Trump\u2019s fate would have been sealed before the 2024 campaign even began. If he loses, it will surely be because he\u2019d become too toxic a figure to win: witness his place on the losing side of every election cycle after that first, narrow victory in 2016. What\u2019s more, the toxicity has only got worse recently, his authoritarian, fascistic tendencies laid barer than ever, whether in his threats to deploy the US military against \u201cthe enemy from within\u201d, meaning his liberal critics, or his reported desire to be surrounded by \u201cthe kind of generals that Hitler had\u201d, obedient to his every whim and diktat. For too many Americans, enough might just have been enough. Trump has torn through so many old-school verities of politics that it\u2019s become tempting to think none of them holds good any more. But on-the-ground organisation still matters. If they win, the Democrats will point to a machine that got their vote out in the critical states, precinct by precinct. Trump outsourced that task to Elon Musk, but there are some things even money cannot buy. A Trump defeat would further confirm another old rule: no politician can ever fully escape his record. This time, to take one example, he hoped to make inroads with Arab and Muslim Americans, distressed and furious at the plight of Palestinians in Gaza. But that would have required those same, crucial voters to forget what Trump had promised a decade ago: a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d, denying entry to the US to people from a long list of Muslim countries.

      "body": "<p>With only four days to go until Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, the poor jobs figures could not have come at a worse time for Kamala Harris.</p> <p>To be sure, there were special factors that explained why the world\u2019s biggest economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/01/us-october-jobs-report\">added only 12,000 new jobs in October</a>.</p> <p>Last month two severe hurricanes \u2013 Helene and Milton \u2013 hit the US. The temporary lay-offs caused by the disruption led to an estimated 20,000 to 50,000 drop in payrolled employees. Manufacturing employment fell by 46,000 \u2013 with most of the drop the result of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/28/boeing-raise-strike-safety-crisis-sell-shares\">strike at the aerospace giant Boeing</a>.</p> <p>But that will come as little comfort to the Harris camp in a knife-edge race for the White House.</p> <p>Even allowing for the hurricanes and the Boeing strike, the employment data was weak. The consensus among analysts \u2013 who knew in advance about the special factors \u2013 was for jobs growth to ease from September\u2019s 254,000 to 113,000 in October.</p> <p>Bradley Saunders, from the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cAll things considered, we suspect the upper limit for the disruptions hit was around 90,000, which means stripping them out, payrolls would only have increased by an underwhelming 102,000.\u201d</p> <p>Jobs growth for August and September was revised down by a combined 112,000 across the two months. That suggests demand for labour has eased at a crucial time.</p> <p>Those with long enough memories will recall something similar happening in the UK during the 1970 election, when the mood in the last few days of the campaign was affected by poor monthly trade figures.</p> <p>As with the US payrolls data, there were reasons why Britain\u2019s trade deficit suddenly widened \u2013 the arrival in the UK of two of Boeing\u2019s new jumbo jets pushed up the value of imports.</p> <p>The Conservatives seized on the data as evidence of an underperforming economy and won an election most polls had showed them on course to lose. Poor trade figures made voters question Labour\u2019s message: that the economy was back on course after the devaluation of the pound in 1967.</p> <p>Harris can now expect Donald Trump to weaponise the jobs figures in the last few days of campaigning. Despite being by far the best-performing G7 economy since the pandemic, many American voters feel worse off as a result of increases in the cost of living. Special factors or not, the weak jobs figures will do nothing to counter that impression.</p>",

      "bodyText": "With only four days to go until Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, the poor jobs figures could not have come at a worse time for Kamala Harris. To be sure, there were special factors that explained why the world\u2019s biggest economy added only 12,000 new jobs in October. Last month two severe hurricanes \u2013 Helene and Milton \u2013 hit the US. The temporary lay-offs caused by the disruption led to an estimated 20,000 to 50,000 drop in payrolled employees. Manufacturing employment fell by 46,000 \u2013 with most of the drop the result of a strike at the aerospace giant Boeing. But that will come as little comfort to the Harris camp in a knife-edge race for the White House. Even allowing for the hurricanes and the Boeing strike, the employment data was weak. The consensus among analysts \u2013 who knew in advance about the special factors \u2013 was for jobs growth to ease from September\u2019s 254,000 to 113,000 in October. Bradley Saunders, from the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cAll things considered, we suspect the upper limit for the disruptions hit was around 90,000, which means stripping them out, payrolls would only have increased by an underwhelming 102,000.\u201d Jobs growth for August and September was revised down by a combined 112,000 across the two months. That suggests demand for labour has eased at a crucial time. Those with long enough memories will recall something similar happening in the UK during the 1970 election, when the mood in the last few days of the campaign was affected by poor monthly trade figures. As with the US payrolls data, there were reasons why Britain\u2019s trade deficit suddenly widened \u2013 the arrival in the UK of two of Boeing\u2019s new jumbo jets pushed up the value of imports. The Conservatives seized on the data as evidence of an underperforming economy and won an election most polls had showed them on course to lose. Poor trade figures made voters question Labour\u2019s message: that the economy was back on course after the devaluation of the pound in 1967. Harris can now expect Donald Trump to weaponise the jobs figures in the last few days of campaigning. Despite being by far the best-performing G7 economy since the pandemic, many American voters feel worse off as a result of increases in the cost of living. Special factors or not, the weak jobs figures will do nothing to counter that impression.",

      "body": "<p><strong>My husband and I have two teenage boys, the youngest being 14. Our younger son has struggled with anxiety and low self-esteem, issues that were exacerbated during the Covid pandemic. One of his primary challenges is around food. He is very underweight, ranking in the lowest 1% for both height and weight</strong><strong>.</strong></p> <p><strong>While my husband and I generally agree on the nature of the problem and the potential solution-seeking help from health professionals and carefully considering how to support our son\u2019s weight gain</strong><strong>, we find ourselves constantly at odds.</strong></p> <p><strong>He seems to believe that I am largely to blame for our son\u2019s issues, </strong><strong>that I don\u2019t take the situation seriously enough. He criticises me for being vegetarian and encouraging our son to follow the same diet \u2013 which is not entirely true, he\u2019s a keen animal</strong><strong>-lover so hard to dissuade! He also blames me for not involving health professionals sooner and for not addressing the issue in the way he believes is necessary, but then he\u2019s not clear what he expects either.</strong></p> <p><strong>His increasing obsession with the issue seems to be exacerbating the problem rather than alleviating it. He places the burden and blame squarely on me, which is making the situation more unpleasant for everyone</strong><strong>. I feel that my husband tends to catastrophise and that his need to assign blame allows him to avoid confronting his role in the problem. </strong></p> <p><strong>I\u2019m deeply unhappy with how he speaks to me about this issue, especially within earshot of our children. This dynamic is becoming increasingly toxic, and I\u2019m unsure how to help him see things from a different perspective.</strong></p> <p>Both you and your husband need to come together for this and stop blaming each other, which will involve compromise on <em>both</em> your parts. Nothing is more important here than your son\u2019s wellbeing and his issues around food may be a demonstration of a greater anxiety that he feels within the home. </p> <p>I went to UKCP-accredited child and adolescent psychotherapist Lucy Fuller. \u201cYou say your son has always struggled with anxiety and low self-esteem so I wonder if he\u2019s finding aspects of his life difficult and this is showing itself in his relationship with food and eating.\u201d In other words the not eating may be a symptom of something else and it\u2019s the something else you may need to get to the bottom of.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m curious,\u201d went on Fuller, \u201cto find out how you and your husband talk to your son about his difficulties and are you able to empathise without trying to correct his behaviours?\u201d</p> <p>We weren\u2019t at all sure if you had taken your son to see someone to get him help.

      "bodyText": "My husband and I have two teenage boys, the youngest being 14. Our younger son has struggled with anxiety and low self-esteem, issues that were exacerbated during the Covid pandemic. One of his primary challenges is around food. He is very underweight, ranking in the lowest 1% for both height and weight. While my husband and I generally agree on the nature of the problem and the potential solution-seeking help from health professionals and carefully considering how to support our son\u2019s weight gain, we find ourselves constantly at odds. He seems to believe that I am largely to blame for our son\u2019s issues, that I don\u2019t take the situation seriously enough. He criticises me for being vegetarian and encouraging our son to follow the same diet \u2013 which is not entirely true, he\u2019s a keen animal-lover so hard to dissuade! He also blames me for not involving health professionals sooner and for not addressing the issue in the way he believes is necessary, but then he\u2019s not clear what he expects either. His increasing obsession with the issue seems to be exacerbating the problem rather than alleviating it. He places the burden and blame squarely on me, which is making the situation more unpleasant for everyone. I feel that my husband tends to catastrophise and that his need to assign blame allows him to avoid confronting his role in the problem. I\u2019m deeply unhappy with how he speaks to me about this issue, especially within earshot of our children. This dynamic is becoming increasingly toxic, and I\u2019m unsure how to help him see things from a different perspective. Both you and your husband need to come together for this and stop blaming each other, which will involve compromise on both your parts. Nothing is more important here than your son\u2019s wellbeing and his issues around food may be a demonstration of a greater anxiety that he feels within the home. I went to UKCP-accredited child and adolescent psychotherapist Lucy Fuller. \u201cYou say your son has always struggled with anxiety and low self-esteem so I wonder if he\u2019s finding aspects of his life difficult and this is showing itself in his relationship with food and eating.\u201d In other words the not eating may be a symptom of something else and it\u2019s the something else you may need to get to the bottom of. \u201cI\u2019m curious,\u201d went on Fuller, \u201cto find out how you and your husband talk to your son about his difficulties and are you able to empathise without trying to correct his behaviours?\u201d We weren\u2019t at all sure if you had taken your son to see someone to get him help. I also went to Beat, the eating disorder charity, who said \u201cthe most important thing now will be to put a plan in place that is in your son\u2019s best interests, seeking input from healthcare professionals. If he is unwell with an eating disorder you may be offered family therapy which could be helpful for you all. If your son does have an eating disorder then he can certainly make a full recovery but the sooner he gets the help he needs the beter his chances of this will be.\u201d Be aware that children can find it very hard to talk about how they feel and may feel disloyal saying anything critical about their parents \u2013 your son may refuse to partake in family therapy because of this. However, your son may \u201cjust\u201d be small and slight \u2013 someone has to be at the edges of percentages.

Still, those comments did not deter some Republican Latinos from affirming their support for Trump. \u201cIf you were already supporting Trump, I don\u2019t think this is a comment that will make you reconsider that choice,\u201d said the journalist Paola Ramos, the author of Defectors: The Rise of the Latino Far Right and What it Means for America. However, Ramos said that she has talked to some Latino voters who are now realizing that Trump\u2019s xenophobia could include them: \u201cThe question is for those that are independent, or those that were flirting with the idea of voting for Trump. The biggest difference is that the narrative, for the first time in a while, shifted from being targeted at immigrants to suddenly being targeted, not just directly at Latinos, but even US citizens.

      "body": "<p>When Anwara fled her home in Myanmar six years ago, the youngest of her three daughters was still only a babe in arms. They were part of a group of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees who crossed the border looking for safety. After walking for several days, they arrived in Cox\u2019s Bazar in south-east Bangladesh, a makeshift settlement that is now home to nearly 1 million Rohingya refugees. Life in the camps is hard, Anwara says. But at least it is providing some security for her family. \u201cWhen we came from Myanmar, we suffered a lot. We didn\u2019t have any money, shelter or food. Now we have a house to live in and receive food rations every month.\u201d</p> <p>Rohingya refugees are in a precarious situation as they have not been formally granted refugee status, so they\u2019re unable to work and integrate with the community outside the camps. Prospects for their return to Myanmar have continued to decrease as levels of violence have risen across the country.</p> <p>In Bangladesh, the south-east is prone to climate disasters such as flooding, cyclones and landslides. Shortfalls in aid funding mean there is increasingly not enough access to safe drinking water, food, or hygiene and health services, with infectious diseases and illnesses spreading easily among the camps\u2019 residents due to overcrowding. Incidents within the densely populated area, such as violence and arson, are common.

They were part of a group of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees who crossed the border looking for safety. After walking for several days, they arrived in Cox\u2019s Bazar in south-east Bangladesh, a makeshift settlement that is now home to nearly 1 million Rohingya refugees. Life in the camps is hard, Anwara says. But at least it is providing some security for her family. \u201cWhen we came from Myanmar, we suffered a lot. We didn\u2019t have any money, shelter or food. Now we have a house to live in and receive food rations every month.\u201d Rohingya refugees are in a precarious situation as they have not been formally granted refugee status, so they\u2019re unable to work and integrate with the community outside the camps. Prospects for their return to Myanmar have continued to decrease as levels of violence have risen across the country. In Bangladesh, the south-east is prone to climate disasters such as flooding, cyclones and landslides. Shortfalls in aid funding mean there is increasingly not enough access to safe drinking water, food, or hygiene and health services, with infectious diseases and illnesses spreading easily among the camps\u2019 residents due to overcrowding. Incidents within the densely populated area, such as violence and arson, are common. In March 2023, a fire that broke out in the camps left 15,000 refugees homeless. Women and girls \u2013 who make up 51% of the refugees living in Cox\u2019s Bazar \u2013 are particularly vulnerable. Many women, like Anwara, fled from their homes in Myanmar alone with their children.

A savings function enables members to invest some of what they earn and take out loans when needed \u2013 for example, to learn new skills that help to make them more financially independent. With the help of a woman who had a sewing machine, Gloria learned to sew.

      "body": "<p>When Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, hundreds of refugees began pouring into Warsaw central station in Poland every day in search of safety. Most were native Ukrainians, while others were third-country nationals who had built a life in Ukraine. For all those fleeing the devastation, it was a time of terror and uncertainty, but for the latter group, it was particularly perilous.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the very beginning of the war, we were getting information about all kinds of abuses that non-Ukrainian [refugees] were facing in Ukraine while trying to get to Poland,\u201d says activist Jarmi\u0142a Rybicka. \u201cAt the border on both sides, non-Ukrainians were expelled or sent to the back of the queues. They were pushed out from trains and told that there was no space for them. Meanwhile, white Ukrainians escaped.\u201d</p> <p>Once they made it into Poland, minority refugees continued to face obstacles at every turn, starting at the train station, where they were not even allowed to use the toilets for free. Prejudice has made finding secure accommodation and work doubly challenging.</p> <p>Marginalised refugees, including women, people of colour and those from the LGBTQ+ community, have found a lifeline at Conflict Kitchen, or Kuchnia Konfliktu, a women-led social enterprise founded by Rybicka in 2016, when she was just 24 years old. It began as a zero-waste, vegan bistro in Warsaw co-run by refugees, bringing them together with local communities through the universal language of food and enabling them to develop new skills, including learning Polish.</p>    <p>Now, Conflict Kitchen has grown exponentially. It facilitates cookery workshops around Poland by women such as Zargan, a Chechen refugee who arrived in Poland with her four young children in 2004 after fleeing the second Chechen war. She teaches other refugees to make dishes such as chepalgash, a pie filled with cheese and wild garlic.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I came to Poland I couldn\u2019t work because I had back problems as a result of being tortured,\u201d says Zargan. \u201cJarmi\u0142a ordered some equipment for me so I could cook and earn an income. I love running cooking workshops \u2013 it\u2019s fun and helps me make money, and I really like meeting new people.\u201d</p> <p>Since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war, Conflict Kitchen has worked in partnership with ActionAid, an international women and girls charity. Together, they initially offered emergency support, including hot food and water at Warsaw central station.</p> <p>Although she doesn\u2019t discriminate, working with refugees from Ukraine as well as elsewhere, Rybicka has a particular passion for helping those from more marginalised communities. \u201cI work with non-Ukrainian [refugees] because they face much more discrimination on so many levels,\u201d says Rybicka.</p>    <p>Qamar, 28, is one such person. Originally from Somalia, she sought asylum in Poland in 2020, staying in a refugee camp for the first six months. \u201cBut when the Ukrainian situation happened, they emptied places for Ukrainian refugees,\u201d she says. \u201cIt felt like there were degrees of refugees \u2013 first degree refugees, second degree refugees, and then Africans.\u201d</p> <p>Thankfully, Conflict Kitchen helped her integrate with the local population. \u201cSince I came to Conflict Kitchen, I have learned to become independent and I\u2019ve made a lot of friends. Going to events helped me to meet people, so now I know all the cooks in the back kitchen from dancing classes or Polish classes.\u201d</p> <p>With funding from ActionAid, the enterprise created Integration Hostel, providing temporary accommodation to refugees like Qamar, originally from countries such as Somalia, Eritrea, Nigeria, Pakistan, and those from the Roma community. Later, the shelter was transformed into independent flats so people could begin rebuilding their lives.</p> <p>Today, with ActionAid, Conflict Kitchen provides case work support to refugees, helping them to access vital services such as housing, education and employment.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the beginning, I had this feeling that ActionAid has this anti-racist approach and was open to the fact that we will support all refugees,\u201d Rybicka says. \u201cWe noticed that they were eager to support our work as it is. There was no pressure or expectation that we should support only Ukrainians. That\u2019s why we put so much emphasis on projects and programmes that refugees create themselves.\u201d</p>    <p>For example, projects such as Refugee Dance Classes, which connect refugees from many cultures with Polish citizens. Ira, 34, who escaped eastern Ukraine with her five-year-old son, Artem, teaches Zumba classes at Baza, an inclusive community centre for minority groups and partner of Conflict Kitchen. Her husband, who works as a border guard in Ukraine, remains there, and Ira hopes to return to her home one day when the conflict is over.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was pregnant, I didn\u2019t expect that I would bring my son up in a foreign country alone without my husband,\u201d says Ira. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard and I\u2019m very emotional. There\u2019s been a lot of very hard things. But there are people around who have helped me to not go crazy. I have support and can ask people to help me.</p> <p>\u201cConflict Kitchen is a great organisation \u2013 they help us to live and to feel better. They support people from different countries and different religions, with different thoughts. You can be yourself and everybody will understand, which is great.\u201d</p> <p>Back home in Ukraine, she met few people from other countries except Russia. Meeting people from all over the world has changed her perspective on other cultures and helped her to realise that every refugee is someone forced to leave everything behind due to events beyond their control.</p> <p>\u201cWe get to know people rather than be afraid of them,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore the war, I didn\u2019t understand what a refugee was. I couldn\u2019t understand who these people were. Now I\u2019m a refugee, I understand.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Support ActionAid<br></strong></em><em>To donate to ActionAid\u2019s Christmas Appeal to help displaced women and girls around the world, please visit <a href=\"https://www.actionaid.org.uk/tracker_redirect.asp?urlurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.actionaid.org.uk%2Fchangelives%2Fchristmas-appeal-13%3Futm_source%3Dguardian.co.uk%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_content%3Dacquisition_xmas24_guardian_article_3_ukraine&amp;tracker_id=5\" rel=\"nofollow\">actionaid.org.uk</a></em></p>    <p><em>ActionAid is registered with the Fundraising Regulator and committed to the highest standards in fundraising.

Ira, 34, who escaped eastern Ukraine with her five-year-old son, Artem, teaches Zumba classes at Baza, an inclusive community centre for minority groups and partner of Conflict Kitchen. Her husband, who works as a border guard in Ukraine, remains there, and Ira hopes to return to her home one day when the conflict is over. \u201cWhen I was pregnant, I didn\u2019t expect that I would bring my son up in a foreign country alone without my husband,\u201d says Ira. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard and I\u2019m very emotional. There\u2019s been a lot of very hard things. But there are people around who have helped me to not go crazy. I have support and can ask people to help me. \u201cConflict Kitchen is a great organisation \u2013 they help us to live and to feel better. They support people from different countries and different religions, with different thoughts. You can be yourself and everybody will understand, which is great.\u201d Back home in Ukraine, she met few people from other countries except Russia. Meeting people from all over the world has changed her perspective on other cultures and helped her to realise that every refugee is someone forced to leave everything behind due to events beyond their control. \u201cWe get to know people rather than be afraid of them,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore the war, I didn\u2019t understand what a refugee was. I couldn\u2019t understand who these people were. Now I\u2019m a refugee, I understand.\u201d Support ActionAid To donate to ActionAid\u2019s Christmas Appeal to help displaced women and girls around the world, please visit actionaid.org.uk ActionAid is registered with the Fundraising Regulator and committed to the highest standards in fundraising.

But \u2013 also obviously \u2013 he was one of the special guys officially given \u201ccleared caller\u201d status in Trump\u2019s White House, meaning they could get through to him any time. Plastics gotta plastic.</p> <p>So yes \u2013 much as I am enjoying all the miles of complex in-depth coverage wondering what it is the current crop of Trump-backing billionaires want from him, I can\u2019t help being reminded of a remark by the tech billionaire in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/07/succession-right-rich-white-lotus-logan-roy\">Succession</a> who is attempting to buy into American power and is attending a pre-election party. \u201cI thought these people would be very complicated,\u201d he reflects. \u201cBut they\u2019re not. It\u2019s basically just money and gossip.\u201d \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s all there is,\u201d comes the reply. \u201cMoney and gossip.\u201d</p> <p>Kamala Harris <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/30/kamala-harris-has-more-billionaires-prominently-backing-her-than-trump-bezos-and-griffin-weigh-in-updated/\">has more billionaires backing her</a>, we keep hearing in news I think is supposed to be a matter of accomplishment for the vice-president. But the particular billionaires pulling for Trump stand on the potential threshold of huge money-and-gossip times. Among the mogul class\u2019s truths-universally-acknowledged is the idea that money is best obtained via deregulation and tax cuts \u2013 and, in the case of, say, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, ever-more lucrative government contracts. As for how gossip is obtained \u2026 People say showbiz is mean and gossipy, but there really is no business as mean and gossipy as \u201cmogul\u201d. Money does not buy you happiness but it totally buys you a better quality of gossip, with the likes of Murdoch, Bezos, Steve Wynn, Stephen Schwarzman and all the others operating at an absolute weapons-grade level.</p> <p>The gossip-money continuum is sort of everything to these guys, and most of them see Trump as their useful idiot. Or useful fucking idiot, in Murdoch\u2019s case. Consider Nelson Peltz, the infamous activist investor (who British people may know as the father-in-law of would-be hot sauce mogul Brooklyn Beckham). Three years ago, Nelson was telling everyone that Trump would carry the disgrace of the 6 January insurrection for ever. \u201cWe had people shooting at each other in Congress,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/07/capitol-riot-investor-nelson-peltz-apologizes-for-voting-for-trump.html\">Peltz fumed</a>. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s beyond belief. And how could you say that is anything but his legacy?\u201d Oh but you could, it turns out. In fact, by early this year, Nelson could be found <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/22/g-s1-29323/what-do-elon-musk-and-other-billionaires-want-in-return-for-backing-trump\">throwing wildly lucrative fundraisers</a> for Trump at his home. And why not? All manner of things could be in it for him. <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/10/28/how-republican-billionaires-learned-to-love-trump-again\">Peltz spent a chunk of Trump\u2019s first term</a> covertly trying to push him to launch an antitrust investigation into Amazon on account of its effect on the US Postal Service. Trump didn\u2019t go that far that time, but he did launch a number of aggressive tweets about it. And rest assured, meanwhile, that the Amazon founder, Bezos, will have bitched a lot on the phone about that.

In fact, speaking of Bezos, take his insistence last week that his Washington Post forgo its traditional candidate endorsement editorial, a decision which has thus far seen <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/28/media/washington-post-endorsement-subscribers-resign/index.html\">members of its editorial board resign</a> and caused a reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/oct/29/washington-post-subscriber-cancellations\">250,000 readers to cancel their subscriptions</a>.</p> <p>Or take Howard Lutnick, the Cantor Fitzgerald CEO, who is moonlighting as a senior official on Trump\u2019s campaign, and who recently floated the idea that all government appointees to any pending Trump administration would have to prove \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/07/trump-election-howard-lutnick-loyalty\">fidelity and loyalty</a>\u201d to him.

While most have to wait until their centenary to receive birthday wishes from King Charles III, he made an exception during the state visit to the UK by Japan\u2019s emperor and empress in June, when he wished Hello Kitty a happy birthday. In 2015, the feline-faced favourite was the subject of a retrospective to celebrate her 40th anniversary called Hello! Exploring the Supercute World of Hello Kitty, which premiered at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. That exhibition made headlines after its curator, Christine R Yano, revealed that the Hello Kitty character was in fact a little girl rather than a cat, as she is never depicted on all fours. The owners confirmed that Hello Kitty actually has a pet cat of her own, called Charmmy Kitty. Hello Kitty is now also a TikTok superstar, with more than 3.5 million followers on her account and 27.9 million likes.",

None suggested maintaining the status quo.</p> <p>Many acknowledged the bind the government was in: if it blinks on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2023/may/04/australia-tobacco-tax-is-among-the-highest-in-the-world-and-is-about-to-get-higher\">excise for legal tobacco</a> and make the illicit market less valuable, it would probably improve the bottom line for multinational tobacco companies.</p> <p>Illegal cigarettes are about half the price of legal cigarettes and are widely available, but not from shadowy figures on street corners or from shady websites on the dark web. Instead, according to police, they are often sold from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2024/sep/25/australia-vaping-ban-tobacconists-smoke-shops-impact\">shopfronts that are rapidly expanding</a> in number throughout the country.</p> <p>These factors make it less likely that smoking addicts will be encouraged to quit, growing the black market that has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/22/earn-or-burn-the-firebombings-and-underworld-conflicts-exposing-australias-illicit-tobacco-trade\">sparked what police believe is a turf war</a> between organised crime groups.</p>    <p>At the same time, legal vapes previously promoted as way to cut tobacco use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/26/australia-vape-ban-laws-details-explained-sales-prescriptions\">have become heavily restricted</a>, despite those products often being sold illegally from the very same shops.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really difficult place that the country is currently in,\u201d says Kathryn Steadman, an associate professor from the University of Queensland.</p> <p>\u201cTobacco is such an awful thing, it\u2019s so detrimental to public health.</p> <p>\u201cAnybody who wants to stamp out tobacco doesn\u2019t necessarily think [the current approach] is the best way to go, but we work within that framework.\u201d</p> <p>John Coyne, the head of strategic policing and law enforcement at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, says public health experts and enforcement agencies agreed about the ideal outcome but were failing to make it happen.</p> <p>\u201cThere have been unintended consequences of this policy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is no longer working so we need to adjust that.\u201d</p> <h2>Where there\u2019s smoke</h2> <p>In 2011, as Australia was being lauded for being the first country in the world to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/10/australia-plain-packaging-cigarette-law\">introduce plain packaging restrictions for cigarettes</a>, a man who would also shake up the tobacco market was sentenced to another stint in prison.</p> <p>Kazem Hamad was 27, had spent much of adolescence in rough suburbs in Melbourne\u2019s outer north, and had known little but crime and hardship since birth.</p> <p>His father was a political activist against the Saddam Hussein regime and was imprisoned in Iraq from 1984 until 1992, according to court material seen by Guardian Australia. One of his brothers died in the country before the family fled, travelling through Jordan and Syria until they were accepted as refugees in Australia.</p> <p>Hamad arrived in Australia aged 14, and lasted only a year at school, as he struggled with English.</p> <p>A court heard in 2010 that he had \u201ca turbulent and traumatic early history\u201d, and a forensic and clinical psychologist who prepared a report on him found that as a child during the Gulf War he saw mutilated bodies.</p> <p>\u201cWhile being initially traumatised by these experiences \u2026 it seems that he became increasingly inured to violence and conflict as a result of these childhood experiences,\u201d the psychologist found.</p>    <p>In 2014, Hamad was charged as part of an Australian federal police investigation into heroin trafficking.</p> <p>\u201cMixing with unsavoury characters led you into drug use and antisocial behaviour, which is reflected throughout your extensive prior criminal history,\u201d a judge found in sentencing him for those offences in 2019.</p> <p>He was deported to Iraq after completing his sentence in 2023, joining an increasingly large number of Australian organised crime figures based offshore.</p> <p>Multiple law enforcement sources confirmed Hamad was thought of as an influential figure in the underworld, with a loyal and ruthless crew.</p> <p>But, previously, he was not thought of a mastermind. He was the sort of person who involved himself in other people\u2019s drug importations rather than organising them himself, and favoured ripping off people he thought of as weak, or using younger more expendable offenders to conduct rudimentary but potentially lucrative crimes, rather than planning more elaborate offending.</p> <p>This included running crews of armed robbers who targeted service stations and other businesses selling cigarettes, and then on-selling these stolen products to other retailers.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the government excise on a single cigarette went from 34c in 2011 to $1.37 \u2013 representing a leap of more than $20 on a pack of 20 cigarettes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/superyacht/index.html?key=oz-datablogs-241025-australian-tobacco-stick-excise-line&amp;location=yacht-charter-data\" data-alt=\"Tobacco excise over time\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/superyacht/index.html?key=oz-datablogs-241025-australian-tobacco-stick-excise-line&location=yacht-charter-data\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>This measure, and others, pushed smoking rates to historic lows.</p> <p>But it had also made the illicit market incredibly lucrative.</p> <p>There is also the question of how, exactly, to define the success of the government\u2019s measures. In some ways, this is because of a glut of information, and in others it is because there is a paucity.</p> <p>Take smoking rates: the health department said in a statement that it analyses this using data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics\u2019s (ABS) National Health Survey (NHS) and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare National Drug Strategy Household survey (NDSHS).</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a consistent long-term decline in smoking prevalence over the last two decades, however, there has been an increase in vaping prevalence in more recent years, particularly among young people,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Indeed, daily smoking rates have fallen from 12.8% in 2013 to 8.3% in 2022-23, according to <a href=\"https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/illicit-use-of-drugs/national-drug-strategy-household-survey/data\">the NDSHS</a>. However, the survey also found that 3.5% of the population have taken up daily vaping in that time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/superyacht/index.html?key=oz-241031-tobacco-vape-smoke-daily-use-testo&amp;location=yacht-charter-data\" data-alt=\"Daily nicotine consumption\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/superyacht/index.html?key=oz-241031-tobacco-vape-smoke-daily-use-testo&location=yacht-charter-data\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>This suggests that up to 12% of the population now either smokes tobacco or vapes on a daily basis \u2013 close to where the country was at with smoking more than a decade ago.</p> <p>The most recent <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/health-conditions-and-risks/national-health-survey/2022#data-downloads\">NHS survey</a>, conducted by the ABS in 2022, suggests 10.6% of Australians smoke and 3% vape on a daily basis. A small percentage of that cohort does both.</p> <h2><strong>Cycle of violence</strong></h2> <p>Graham Banks, a Victoria police detective inspector who leads Taskforce Lunar in investigating alleged arson attacks believed to be linked to the illicit market, says organised crime groups started investing in tobacconists more than a decade ago.</p> <p>\u201cThey made a lot of money, and the value of each of those stores has grown as the excise has grown, and then the introduction of vapes is another significant stream of revenue,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In March last year, he says, a group of people involved in the illicit tobacco trade met to discuss business.

      "bodyText": "There are three tobacconists in a strip of no more than a dozen shops on the same side of a street in Melbourne\u2019s west. Earlier this year, someone reached between the metal bars protecting one shop, smashed the front window and flung a molotov cocktail inside. Eight days later, a driver rammed the security screen at a second store and tried to set it alight before fleeing. A jerry can was left on the street as if in homage to the failed arson. Such fires at such stores have occurred on high streets across Victoria over the past 18 months. In most cases, the businesses are still trading, neon signs flashing and customers coming and going. There is no indication they were so recently embroiled in a fight between organised crime groups that is threatening one of Australia\u2019s signature public health achievements: reducing the rate of smoking. Arson attacks across four states have left the federal government in a particularly invidious position: wedged between underworld figures and big tobacco companies. While the firebombings \u2013 of which there have been more than 120 since the start of last year \u2013 have captured attention, there has been little consideration of how the problem of illicit tobacco built over the past decade during a time Australia was becoming a world leader in restricting tobacco use. Nearly 30 people were contacted for this story. None suggested maintaining the status quo. Many acknowledged the bind the government was in: if it blinks on the excise for legal tobacco and make the illicit market less valuable, it would probably improve the bottom line for multinational tobacco companies. Illegal cigarettes are about half the price of legal cigarettes and are widely available, but not from shadowy figures on street corners or from shady websites on the dark web. Instead, according to police, they are often sold from shopfronts that are rapidly expanding in number throughout the country. These factors make it less likely that smoking addicts will be encouraged to quit, growing the black market that has sparked what police believe is a turf war between organised crime groups. At the same time, legal vapes previously promoted as way to cut tobacco use have become heavily restricted, despite those products often being sold illegally from the very same shops. \u201cIt\u2019s a really difficult place that the country is currently in,\u201d says Kathryn Steadman, an associate professor from the University of Queensland. \u201cTobacco is such an awful thing, it\u2019s so detrimental to public health. \u201cAnybody who wants to stamp out tobacco doesn\u2019t necessarily think [the current approach] is the best way to go, but we work within that framework.\u201d John Coyne, the head of strategic policing and law enforcement at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, says public health experts and enforcement agencies agreed about the ideal outcome but were failing to make it happen. \u201cThere have been unintended consequences of this policy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is no longer working so we need to adjust that.\u201d Where there\u2019s smoke In 2011, as Australia was being lauded for being the first country in the world to introduce plain packaging restrictions for cigarettes, a man who would also shake up the tobacco market was sentenced to another stint in prison. Kazem Hamad was 27, had spent much of adolescence in rough suburbs in Melbourne\u2019s outer north, and had known little but crime and hardship since birth. His father was a political activist against the Saddam Hussein regime and was imprisoned in Iraq from 1984 until 1992, according to court material seen by Guardian Australia. One of his brothers died in the country before the family fled, travelling through Jordan and Syria until they were accepted as refugees in Australia. Hamad arrived in Australia aged 14, and lasted only a year at school, as he struggled with English. A court heard in 2010 that he had \u201ca turbulent and traumatic early history\u201d, and a forensic and clinical psychologist who prepared a report on him found that as a child during the Gulf War he saw mutilated bodies. \u201cWhile being initially traumatised by these experiences \u2026 it seems that he became increasingly inured to violence and conflict as a result of these childhood experiences,\u201d the psychologist found. In 2014, Hamad was charged as part of an Australian federal police investigation into heroin trafficking. \u201cMixing with unsavoury characters led you into drug use and antisocial behaviour, which is reflected throughout your extensive prior criminal history,\u201d a judge found in sentencing him for those offences in 2019. He was deported to Iraq after completing his sentence in 2023, joining an increasingly large number of Australian organised crime figures based offshore. Multiple law enforcement sources confirmed Hamad was thought of as an influential figure in the underworld, with a loyal and ruthless crew. But, previously, he was not thought of a mastermind. He was the sort of person who involved himself in other people\u2019s drug importations rather than organising them himself, and favoured ripping off people he thought of as weak, or using younger more expendable offenders to conduct rudimentary but potentially lucrative crimes, rather than planning more elaborate offending. This included running crews of armed robbers who targeted service stations and other businesses selling cigarettes, and then on-selling these stolen products to other retailers. Meanwhile, the government excise on a single cigarette went from 34c in 2011 to $1.37 \u2013 representing a leap of more than $20 on a pack of 20 cigarettes. This measure, and others, pushed smoking rates to historic lows. But it had also made the illicit market incredibly lucrative. There is also the question of how, exactly, to define the success of the government\u2019s measures. In some ways, this is because of a glut of information, and in others it is because there is a paucity. Take smoking rates: the health department said in a statement that it analyses this using data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics\u2019s (ABS) National Health Survey (NHS) and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare National Drug Strategy Household survey (NDSHS). \u201cThere has been a consistent long-term decline in smoking prevalence over the last two decades, however, there has been an increase in vaping prevalence in more recent years, particularly among young people,\u201d it said. Indeed, daily smoking rates have fallen from 12.8% in 2013 to 8.3% in 2022-23, according to the NDSHS. However, the survey also found that 3.5% of the population have taken up daily vaping in that time. This suggests that up to 12% of the population now either smokes tobacco or vapes on a daily basis \u2013 close to where the country was at with smoking more than a decade ago. The most recent NHS survey, conducted by the ABS in 2022, suggests 10.6% of Australians smoke and 3% vape on a daily basis. A small percentage of that cohort does both. Cycle of violence Graham Banks, a Victoria police detective inspector who leads Taskforce Lunar in investigating alleged arson attacks believed to be linked to the illicit market, says organised crime groups started investing in tobacconists more than a decade ago. \u201cThey made a lot of money, and the value of each of those stores has grown as the excise has grown, and then the introduction of vapes is another significant stream of revenue,\u201d he says. In March last year, he says, a group of people involved in the illicit tobacco trade met to discuss business. The agenda was to set a price for their product by forming a \u201ccommission\u201d or cartel to control the illicit market and ensure everyone took a fair cut. Banks alleges the meeting featured a national leader of an outlaw motorcycle gang, a \u201csignificant family within Middle Eastern organised crime\u201d who had extensive dealings with illicit tobacco themselves, and other \u201cpretty serious parties\u201d. There were no more than six people present. Each store was capable of making about $20,000 a week, Banks says, or more than $1m a year. \u201cTheir view was to try and holistically control the market, we think, and that created \u2026 friction straight away.\u201d Police believe the person it created most friction with was Hamad, who refused to reach any agreement. Hamad, 40, instead set about trying to cut his rivals off at the knees by forcing store owners to sell to him, pay him a cut, sell his illegal product, or a combination of the three, police believe. If the owner resisted, the store would be firebombed. That sparked waves of retaliation. \u201cThe history of violence is there, and known and understood,\u201d Banks says. \u201cViolence has been the key to it, and when you operate on a grey market, there\u2019s a vulnerability to them [store owners]. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re the biggest gorilla in the room, people become subservient to you.\u201d It is a cycle that shows no obvious sign of breaking. The violence has spread to other states, sometimes as an extension of the Victorian conflict, other times in apparent copycat attacks. Guardian Australia asked every state and territory police force how many arson attacks on tobacco shops had occurred in their jurisdictions since the start of last year, and what measures, if any, they were taking regarding illicit tobacco. New South Wales police declined to comment, saying a government information public access request would have to be lodged for information. South Australia police confirmed that as of 8 October it had six fires, all of which had occurred this year. It has launched a taskforce to investigate the issue. Western Australia police referred to a media statement published in June, but otherwise did not comment, but several arson attacks have been publicly reported in the past year. There were no arson attacks in Tasmania and the ACT, and the Northern Territory and Queensland police forces either did not respond or failed to answer the question, but there have been several reported attacks in Queensland, mostly in the south-east. Banks believes the violence won\u2019t stop while there are still shops to fight for. \u201cWhile the shopfronts exist, and there\u2019s an ability to seek to control them, there will be a conflict,\u201d he says. \u201cThe parties that are in conflict are just not the type that are going to cede control to the other party. \u201cWe\u2019ll make arrests \u2026 but there\u2019s so many significant players involved that it will just be seen as an opportunity by others when those people are taken out.\u201d There is no shortage of government agencies closely monitoring how the fight against illicit tobacco plays out. This thicket of regulatory responsibility may have, in fact, contributed to the problem. The health, taxation and home affairs departments all have oversight of some part of the issue, and bodies within these departments even more specific focuses: the Australian Border Force, within Home Affairs, leads the illicit tobacco taskforce; the Therapeutic Goods Administration, within health, looks after vape restrictions. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic case of siloed policy,\u201d says Coyne from ASPI. \u201cLaw enforcement, health, border force, taxation revenue \u2026 every single person involved has the right idea and the right ambitions but the collective policy result is undesirable.\u201d These bodies, however, do not outwardly appear ready to pull the lever on pausing, or even cutting, excises. Michael Outram, the ABF commissioner, was asked at the National Press Club last month about how to tackle illicit tobacco and whether lowering the price of legal smokes would solve the problem. He said he favoured \u201cmore closely aligning\u201d the efforts of federal bodies and state authorities to crack down on the issue. Outram acknowledged the ATO estimated that about 17% of the tobacco market was illicit, a value of about $2.8bn, but said he was \u201cill-equipped\u201d to comment on tax policies. However, the government itself has struggled to comprehend the size of the tobacco market. Federal budgets have regularly overestimated the total revenues to be derived from the tobacco excise \u2013 often by several billion dollars each year. This is despite regular increases to the excise rate. In July, tobacco company Philip Morris, which has its own commercial interest in a crackdown on the trade, told a Victorian inquiry it believed the tobacco black market was considerably larger than has been estimated by the ATO. Instead, it said, the illicit market \u201caccounts for over 28.6% of overall tobacco sales in Australia\u201d. Meanwhile, a Therapeutic Goods Administration report examined by a Senate inquiry this year heard that as many as 97% of users were estimated to be buying their vapes from the black market, estimating the trade to be \u201cworth well over $400m million annually\u201d. \u2018We need a tough cop on the beat\u2019 There is also the not insignificant issue of how contested the academic and public health space is, largely because of the decades of lobbying done by big tobacco that has morphed into a multiheaded beast spruiking everything from the benefits of vaping to the interests of small business owners selling legal tobacco. It appears, however, there is no shortage of information available about what exactly governments can do to tackle the issue. In a submission earlier this year to the Senate committee regarding vaping reforms, the Police Federation of Australia\u2019s chief executive, Scott Weber, noted it was the fourth time he had made such a submission or given evidence regarding illegal tobacco or vapes in the past five years. If there is a common thread among the various bodies, it is that there is a need for greater enforcement; something that even public health experts who spoke to the Guardian acknowledged was necessary, despite it impinging on some of their other values. Banks, the Victorian detective, says his taskforce has lobbied the Insurance Council of Australia to ratchet up pressure on landlords who lease their buildings to tobacconists, and he is focusing on investigations into syndicate kingpins, while continuing to prosecute lower-level offenders involved in the arsons themselves. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s an insurer in the world saying they\u2019re happy to be insuring a place that\u2019s selling illicit goods and subject to extortion and arson attacks,\u201d he says. The shadow health minister, Anne Ruston, would not comment on whether the Coalition would adjust the excise, saying instead it would commit $250m to fund an illegal tobacco and vaping taskforce led by the Australian federal police and the Australian Border Force. \u201cIt is clear that we need a tough cop on the beat,\u201d she said. Another complicating factor, one that cannot be determined by parliamentary committees or police taskforces, is understanding whether those who buy illegal cigarettes are troubled by the carnage they are funding. Banks says one man with links to the illicit market had been killed in the past 18 months, and police had warned others that the involvement in the trade had put their lives at risk. But in places such as the hardscrabble outer-north of Melbourne, in the suburbs where Hamad and his crew used to run amok, those who cannot shake their addictions are unlikely to spend double for the same fix. \u201cIt\u2019s a lower-class, a working-class issue, smoking,\u201d says Leila Alloush, the chief executive of Victorian Arabic Social Services, based in Broadmeadows. \u201cPeople are limited and cannot afford expensive cigarettes.

      "bodyText": "China and Russia are working together to block new Antarctic marine parks and loosen krill fishing restrictions, undermining a major international convention designed to protect the region from overexploitation, according to analysts and conservationists. With the support of Russia, China reportedly used its veto rights at a meeting of the 26-nation Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) in Tasmania to prevent the renewal of an agreement restricting krill fishing. The two countries also blocked the declaration of four marine parks around the southern continent. Experts said it reflected a push to resist and reverse environmental protections in Antarctica. Krill is an important food source for keystone species including penguins, seals and whales, and fishing restrictions have previously been backed by scientists and member countries to ease pressures on wildlife as the region is affected by global heating. Dr Tony Press, a former head of the Australian Antarctic Division and adjunct professor at the University of Tasmania, said the precautionary principal that had been supported by countries at CCAMLR meetings for three decades had \u201cgone backwards\u201d at the meeting that finished last week. \u201cThat sets a very bad precedent for the future,\u201d he said. The commission has a rule restricting the annual krill take in four neighbouring zones around the west Antarctic peninsula to 620,000 tonnes a year. The four zones cover the west Antarctic peninsular, neighbouring waters in the Weddell Sea and around the South Orkney and South Georgia islands. A separate rule, known as measure 51-07, says no more than 45% of that catch can be taken from any one of those zones. Countries at the meeting were seeking to renew that rule, in place since 2009. Dr Lyn Goldsworthy, from the University of Tasmania and a longtime observer at CCAMLR meetings, said China had refused to support the renewal of 51-07 and been backed by Russia. She said the Chinese government\u2019s most recent five-year plan included an expansion of international fishing and the country had committed to building five new vessels to catch krill, four of which were almost complete. \u201cChina has a long-term strategy. They have a directive to expand that krill fishery [in Antarctica],\u201d she said. Goldsworthy said China was also seeking to exert its influence in the region for geopolitical reasons, with an eye on future exploitation. She said Russia\u2019s interest was likely part of a broader strategy to \u201cdisrupt the world\u2019s rules-based order\u201d as the country had \u201cvery little skin in the game\u201d.

It\u2019s about the mystery at the centre of love, but it also captures something about the man himself: we think we know Paul Kelly, have in some way always known him, and yet he constantly surprises us.</p> <p>As we amble from his St Kilda home down to the Port Phillip Bay foreshore on a day that threatens to turn blistery at any moment, Kelly talks about mystery and surprise. His short-haired border collie, Queenie, joins us, scurrying ahead and then turning back to look at us like an impatient schoolkid.<strong> </strong>Kelly, wrapped in a well-worn corduroy jacket, bends down and clicks his fingers in a vain attempt to summon her.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>\u201cIt is a mystery,\u201d Kelly says of his songwriting skill. \u201cI never quite know what I\u2019m doing. Most of the time when I\u2019m writing songs, I\u2019m boring myself,\u201d he admits.</p> <p>\u201cEvery now and then, there\u2019s a surprise. And then you have to try and follow it down.\u201d</p> <p>Following it down, like mining a seam, can take Kelly to some unusual places. In a career spanning decades \u2013 his first public performance was in a folk club in Hobart, circa 1974 \u2013 his output has drifted through musical sub-genres like an itinerant hitchhiker. He may be most recognised for his folk and rock-inflected material, songs like From St Kilda to Kings Cross and Before Too Long, but so much of his songwriting strays in grand looping discursions through bluegrass, jazz, country, alt-rock and even pure pop.</p>    <p>\u201cI\u2019m not a natural musician,\u201d Kelly explains as we cross Beach Road on to the sand and Queenie leaps off the lead in anticipation. \u201cLike most writers, I tend to fall into my own habits or grooves. So I\u2019ve always been interested in collaboration with other people.\u201d</p> <p>This hunger in Kelly to expand the limits of his own talent has seen him work with some of the world\u2019s greatest musicians in a bewildering range of contexts \u2013 from touring with Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen to recording a live album with Neil Finn at the Sydney Opera House. But really, this experimentation is happening continuously with his core band, which includes sisters Vika and Linda Bull and his nephew Dan Kelly.</p> <p>\u201cIt always starts with the band,\u201d Kelly says, as the southerly wind whips around us. \u201cThey bring things to the songs I can\u2019t imagine. I like to be surprised, I want to be surprised. And working with other people is a way of writing something you couldn\u2019t have come up with yourself.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hit and miss with other people, but then there\u2019s a lot of hit and miss by yourself as well.\u201d</p> <p>His new album, Fever Longing Still, is in many ways a quintessential Paul Kelly album, full of songs that wouldn\u2019t seem out of place slotted into records like Life is Fine or even Under the Sun (Kelly\u2019s 1987 pub-rock classic that included hits like Dumb Things and To Her Door). And yet for all its familiarity, it doesn\u2019t feel remotely like pastiche; there\u2019s an immediacy and emotional honesty typical of Kelly and impossible to fake.</p> <p>It opens with Houndstooth Dress, a vivid, driving track that pulses with a kind of dirty swagger. It\u2019s capable of lushness, as in Hello Melancholy, Hello Joy, and the expansiveness of All Those Smiling Faces, which Kelly calls \u201cthe love song about clan.\u201d It ends in what seems a deliberate echo of How to Make Gravy, the quotidian but deeply poignant Going to the River with Dad. </p>    <p>We wind around the shoreline and back into the bustling streets of St Kilda as Kelly opens up about his process. He has a shuffling, slightly apologetic walk and his dark, hooded expression is occasionally broken by his tight, enigmatic smile.</p> <p>\u201cYou never really understand a record till you\u2019re halfway through it or towards the end of it. We just record songs when I\u2019ve got them, and sort of stockpile them, I guess.\u201d He files them in his MacBook under \u201codd socks drawer\u201d. For Fever Longing Still, Kelly knew he wanted an album of love songs, one that incorporated not just romantic love but parental love, community love, friendship.</p> <p>\u201cRaymond Carver is an influence on my songwriting. His stories are very minimal, but there\u2019s always something happening at the edges. They\u2019re often unresolved,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Kelly is interested in the things that spill over the frame of a song, in the way love tends to spread its influence beyond the lovers. It\u2019s reflective, perhaps, of his own relationship history: twice married and divorced, with three adult kids, Kelly is now in a long-term partnership with documentary director Si\u00e2n Darling.</p> <p>The challenge was finding a pathway from the overt sexuality of Houndstooth Dress to the plaintive and elegiac final track. \u201cThey\u2019re completely different to one another, it\u2019s quite paradoxical,\u201d Kelly says. Trying to plot the transitions \u201cbecomes like a puzzle or a game. And in between, we can fill the album with all these different colours.\u201d</p>    <p>One aspect of Kelly\u2019s songwriting that is often overlooked is its literary sophistication. In his paean to rest, Eight Hours Sleep, Kelly quotes Macbeth\u2019s \u201csleep that knits up the ravelled sleeve of care\u201d. References to notable poets like Emily Dickinson, Tennyson and Homer pepper his work, as well as more obscure figures like Kenneth Slessor and Wislawa Szymborska. It comes out in his speech, too, the shrugging modesty flecked occasionally with poeticism and grace.</p> <p>\u201cI grew up with folk music,\u201d says Kelly. In that tradition \u201cit\u2019s quite normal for lines and titles and melodies to float around and get picked up on\u201d. Literary allusions \u201ckind of slip past, I think\u201d, overlooked perhaps because they\u2019ve always been there. \u201cShakespeare\u2019s been floating in and out of my songs for a long time.\u201d</p> <p>We wander up Blessington St and into the St Kilda Botanical Gardens, shielded from the wind now and noticeably warmer. We talk a bit more about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/aug/05/paul-kelly-interview-australian-poetry-month-dana-gioia\">poetry and the role it\u2019s had on Kelly\u2019s career</a>. Approached in 2012 by the Australian National Academy of Music to write a song cycle for its students, Kelly decided to set some poetry to music.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d never thought that was possible; I always thought if you had the words first it would somehow restrict the music, make it run on too rigid a rail,\u201d he says. Kelly usually composes the music first, \u201cwith gibberish and a few words attached, maybe a title.\u201d Now, with words that had richness and resonance already set down, he found new ways to access his own musicianship.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a revelation.\u201d</p> <p>Now Kelly prepares for his most audacious career move yet: a series of arena-sized shows around the country. While not completely alien to those massive venues \u2013 \u201cI have played those big stages at various multi-lineups\u201d \u2013 these concerts have a celebratory, retrospective feel to them. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/09/how-to-make-gravy-first-trailer-release-film-paul-kelly-song-christmas\">How to Make Gravy: first trailer for film based on Paul Kelly song released</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked if he\u2019s nervous about the increase in scale, he replies simply: \u201cNot really.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019ve got the songs that I know will work, songs that have big ringing chords and are more cinematic in scope,\u201d he says.

Literary allusions \u201ckind of slip past, I think\u201d, overlooked perhaps because they\u2019ve always been there. \u201cShakespeare\u2019s been floating in and out of my songs for a long time.\u201d We wander up Blessington St and into the St Kilda Botanical Gardens, shielded from the wind now and noticeably warmer. We talk a bit more about poetry and the role it\u2019s had on Kelly\u2019s career. Approached in 2012 by the Australian National Academy of Music to write a song cycle for its students, Kelly decided to set some poetry to music. \u201cI\u2019d never thought that was possible; I always thought if you had the words first it would somehow restrict the music, make it run on too rigid a rail,\u201d he says. Kelly usually composes the music first, \u201cwith gibberish and a few words attached, maybe a title.\u201d Now, with words that had richness and resonance already set down, he found new ways to access his own musicianship. \u201cIt was a revelation.\u201d Now Kelly prepares for his most audacious career move yet: a series of arena-sized shows around the country. While not completely alien to those massive venues \u2013 \u201cI have played those big stages at various multi-lineups\u201d \u2013 these concerts have a celebratory, retrospective feel to them. Asked if he\u2019s nervous about the increase in scale, he replies simply: \u201cNot really.\u201d We\u2019ve got the songs that I know will work, songs that have big ringing chords and are more cinematic in scope,\u201d he says. But then, touring with Cohen and Dylan has taught him that, even in cavernous venues full of thousands of screaming fans, intimacy and introspection can still have a powerful effect. \u201cA quiet song in a really big space can be incredible. The sound of 90,000 people being silent is different to 100 people being silent. It\u2019s got this great presence and energy.\u201d As we reach the rose garden we come across a troupe of actors rehearsing a scene from Twelfth Night. Kelly seems keen to give them space, as if aware of something alchemical in the air. \u201cLet\u2019s go around the long way,\u201d he says. Fever Longing Still by Paul Kelly is out now",

This page will be regularly updated so you can track who is polling up, how the independents are faring and how the parties stand with different demographics.

It factors in sample sizes, previous results and \u201chouse effects\u201d (bias towards a party) of each pollster. While the first chart shows the estimated state of play when our model was last run, the next shows a timeline of the two-party preferred (2pp) vote since 2022: Looking at two-party support alone can obscure one of the biggest stories of the last election: almost a third of votes were for independents and other parties. The 68.5% primary votes share for Labor and the Coalition is an all time low and the continuation of a steady decline since the two parties claimed 98% of votes in 1951. The chart below shows the primary votes for Labor, the Coalition, Greens and others/independents. It is based on the same model as our main tracker, starting with the vote share at the last election. Use the drop-down menu to see what has changed over different periods since the election. To get a sample that reflects the nation at large, pollsters collect a lot of demographic information, including age, sex, location and education. Polling companies occasionally release two-party preferred measures for these sub-demographics. The following charts use simple rolling averages to try to find the underlying trend in two-party support. There has been no adjustment for sample size, house effects, weighting or release date. The first shows support by the age group of the respondent. The next chart groups respondents by education \u2013 those with no tertiary education, those with a Tafe or technical education, and those with university education. The chart below groups respondents by sex \u2013 male or female. As the numbers are rolling averages, they will not always add up to 100. The final demographic category is state. Data is not available for all states, largely because of their size. Tasmania, for instance, makes up about 2% of the population. A representative sample of 1,000 Australians would have far too few Tasmanians to provide a robust estimate. The final table shows the two-party preferred share for all of the polls that feed into our models. Notes and methods The main poll tracker is based on work by Dr Luke Mansillo and Prof Simon Jackman. You can find their paper here. The model in different disciplines is called a hidden Markov model or a state space model and employs a Kalman filter algorithm that uses a series of measurements over time, including statistical noise and other inaccuracies, to produce estimates. These types of models are often used in fields such as robotics, economics and medicine to create estimates from noisy measurements. Each newly published poll is treated as a new measurement, with the model factoring in new data in the context of what has come before. The model begins with (is anchored to) the vote share for each party at the last federal election. Only polls with a defined sampling procedure, reported sample size and fielding dates have been included in our dataset. Sample sizes are adjusted to account for non response.

They\u2019re big, white and fluffy \u2013 a huge hit with members. In fact, the whole brand is a big hit. There\u2019s now a waitlist of 15,000 people and another club (smaller membership, larger club fees) is scheduled to open in Toorak before the end of the year, Gurner says. </p> <h2>A world of wellness</h2> <p>There are different tiers of membership. At the top you have access to everything. It\u2019s wrap-around healthcare for the rich: MRI testing, brain testing, bloods, genetics, then a list of supplements aimed at optimising training, calories, macros, recovery and sleep. You can see a psychologist, a physio, a massage therapist. They\u2019ll wash your gym clothes and design a personalised perfume for you that you\u2019ll find in your locker every day.

He had shown no remorse and there was no realistic prospect of rehabilitation, said Mr Justice Johnson at Woolwich crown court. \u201cAll of his actions so far suggest that he regards himself as above the law.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the dock, Robinson pumped his chest and saluted his loyal supporters in the public gallery. They blew kisses back. He was taken to Belmarsh high-security prison in south-east London.</p> \n<p>The jailing of Robinson is the latest episode in his apparently inexorable rise from the owner of a tanning salon in Luton, Bedfordshire, to the brash pin-up hero of the far right in the UK, the US and beyond. He is, arguably, the most potent individual to have emerged on the British far right since Enoch Powell.</p> \n<p>Along the way, he has served four jail terms, and has now begun his fifth. None appear to have led him to reflect on and reconsider his actions; indeed, they have reinforced his image as a political martyr to the cause of rightwing extremism.</p> \n<p>Robinson is a complex and often contradictory figure, but \u201cwe should not underestimate him\u201d, said Nick Lowles, the chief executive of the anti-racism campaign group <a href=\"https://hopenothate.org.uk/\">Hope not Hate</a>, who has watched him closely for years.</p> \n<p>He is \u201cmassively charismatic\u201d with \u201cenormous reach\u201d, said Lowles. \u201cHe has an ability to bring huge crowds together on a level that we haven\u2019t seen previously. His videos are watched in the millions.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was easy to see why Robinson, 41, had emerged as a high-profile leader of the far right, said Lowles. \u201cFirstly, he is charismatic and instils a sense of loyalty and following. Secondly, he is willing to get stuck in. He\u2019s willing to go to prison, and he\u2019s the first one in a fight.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen someone crosses him, he acts like a gangster. He sends threatening voice notes to people. And he doesn\u2019t hold back. Things like: \u2018If you do X, I\u2019m going to come around to your house and smash your fucking face in.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Born Stephen Yaxley in 1982 in Luton to an Irish mother and English father, he was first jailed in his early 20s for assaulting an off-duty police officer. After his release, he and his cousin Kevin Carroll founded the English Defence League (EDL) organisation \u201cagainst the rise of radical Islam\u201d. They initially recruited members among local football fans. According to Robinson\u2019s self-published autobiography, it was the beginning of \u201cyears of mad laughs with the lads\u201d.</p> \n<p>As media attention grew, he cast around for a pseudonym. Taking the name of a fellow Luton Town FC supporter, \u201cTommy Robinson\u201d stepped on to the public stage.</p> \n<p>Robinson and the EDL focused on what they claimed was an Islamic threat. The chant of \u201cMuslim bombers off our streets\u201d was heard at rallies and protests. Robinson asserted that Muslims would outnumber \u201cEuropeans\u201d within a few decades.</p> \n<p>Lucy Brown, a journalist who worked with Robinson a few years ago before falling out with him, said he did not fit most people\u2019s definition of a racist. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like people talking about skin colour. But Islam, and the position he has taken is definitely his thing. It\u2019s his brand.\u201d</p> \n<p>Later, after serving a prison sentence for using another man\u2019s passport to travel to the US, Robinson announced he had parted company with the EDL. At a press conference, he acknowledged the \u201cdangers of far-right extremism\u201d and the \u201cneed to counter Islamist ideology not with violence but with better, democratic ideas\u201d.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, he continued to use multiple social media platforms to galvanise his supporters. His posts not only whipped up anti-Muslim hatred and brought increasing numbers on to the streets, they also generated hard cash in response to appeals for donations. The Tommy Robinson brand was becoming a lucrative earner.</p> \n<p>In 2018, Robinson was banned from Twitter for breaching its rules on \u201chateful conduct\u201d, and his accounts on Facebook and Instagram were suspended the following year for repeatedly breaking rules on hate speech. But by 2023, Elon Musk, Twitter\u2019s new owner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/06/x-elon-musk-reinstating-katie-hopkins-tommy-robinson\">reinstated Robinson\u2019s account</a>. He now has 1 million followers.</p> \n<p>He also began to win supporters abroad, principally among rightwingers and wealthy backers in the US and Canada. \u201cHe has found a way to make hate pay,\u201d said Lowles. \u201cHe has monetised hate in a way that no one else has done.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lowles added: \u201cHe talks about building a movement, but it\u2019s all about Tommy. He\u2019s built a multimillion-pound empire \u2026 He rakes in huge amounts of money. He\u2019s been talking about this great movement for a while, but really the movement is him.\u201d</p> \n<p>Robinson\u2019s latest platform is Urban Scoop, which claims to champion independent journalism and \u201cgenuine, unbiased and corporate-free content\u201d. Echoing Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-media-stock-musk-x-social-5328feb1a782cc65bd05b7e30756b8db\">lucrative Truth Social platform</a>, Urban Scoop claims to \u201cwork tirelessly to fortify and reunite our nation\u201d and provide \u201cthe truth beyond mainstream media\u201d. Supporters are invited to make donations, including through various crypto currencies, and buy merchandise.</p> \n<p>Hope Not Hate has called for Robinson\u2019s finances to be investigated by the authorities. The advocacy group says that although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/20/tommy-robinson-pursued-for-estimated-2m-debt-after-bankruptcy-claim\">Robinson declared himself bankrupt in 2021</a>, he continued to enjoy a lavish lifestyle and squander \u201cvast sums on gambling, drinking and partying \u2026 expensive villas and top-end hotels\u201d.</p> \n<p>A stark illustration of this came a few months ago when Robinson helped to foment riots on the streets of the UK from a five-star hotel in Cyprus. The unrest followed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/30/people-in-critical-condition-southport-attack-stabbings\">killing of three young girls at a dance class in Southport</a>.</p> \n<p>Having failed to appear at a court hearing in London, Robinson took his family on holiday where he used social media to disseminate disinformation about the Southport attack and called on his supporters to \u201crise up\u201d. Violent disorder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/01/the-areas-in-england-where-riots-have-broken-out-since-southport-attack\">spread across more than two dozen towns and cities</a>, with some of those involved chanting \u201cTommy Robinson\u201d as they threw bricks, started fires and assaulted police officers.</p> \n<p>For more than a week, the UK was in the grip of the unrest. Keir Starmer, the new prime minister, cancelled his summer holiday as Robinson operated from his sun lounger with apparent impunity.</p> \n<p>Another rightwing populist leader was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/aug/13/nigel-farage-irresponsible-dangerous-riots-tom-tugendhat-conservatives\">accused of irresponsible and dangerous behaviour</a> over the riots. Nigel Farage, newly elected as an MP, was described as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2024-07-31/farage-hits-back-after-he-was-called-tommy-robinson-in-a-suit\">nothing better than a Tommy Robinson in a suit</a>\u201d by Brendan Cox, the husband of the murdered MP Jo Cox.</p> \n<p>Farage swiftly distanced himself from \u201cviolence and thuggery\u201d. In a <a href=\"https://x.com/Nigel_Farage/status/1820871075783143813\">video post on X</a>, he said: \u201cAs for the Tommy Robinsons and those that genuinely do stir up hatred, well I\u2019ve never had anything to do with them.\u201d</p> \n<p>But with Robinson and Farage fishing in a similar pool of support, there is little doubt Robinson exerts pressure from the right on Farage and his party, Reform UK (which in turn exerts pressure on the Conservative party, which lost power this year).<strong> </strong>\u201cRobinson has an appeal which isn\u2019t much smaller than Farage\u2019s,\u201d said Lowles. On top of that, he added, polling showed Robinson enjoyed name recognition among the British public that was greater than many current frontline politicians.</p> \n<p>At the Trafalgar Square rally in July, Robinson asked the huge crowd if anyone had voted Labour in the general election a couple of weeks earlier. The question was met with boos. When he asked if anyone had voted for Farage\u2019s party, the crowd erupted in cheers.</p> \n<p>But Robinson\u2019s supporters are mostly not interested in elections and political parties. The movement that has no name and no structure is now part of a \u201cpost-organisational\u201d far right, the creation of a shrewd influencer and a social media revolution.</p> \n<p>And it is a movement that appears to be growing. The size of the Trafalgar Square crowd took many Robinson-watchers by surprise. Last weekend, up to 20,000 also joined a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/26/tensions-as-three-protest-marches-converge-in-central-london\">\u201cUniting the Kingdom\u201d protest march</a> in London. New cohorts of followers \u2013 including more women \u2013 appear to be drawn to Robinson, who has sought at intervals to opportunistically broaden his political message beyond anti-Islam.</p> \n<p>He has promoted debunked conspiracy theories about the Covid vaccine and, in more recent times, taken a socially conservative pivot by using language about Christianity. \u201cChrist is King\u201d has become a new chant at his rallies.</p> \n<p>The prison sentence handed to Robinson earlier this week followed his admission of contempt of court by repeating false allegations against a Syrian refugee, including posting on social media a libellous film called Silenced, which has had 55m views.</p> \n<p>On being told his sentence could be reduced by four months if he removed the film, Robinson shook his head and appeared to say \u201cnah\u201d.</p> \n<p>He is likely to serve nine months of his 18-month sentence. Since being jailed, Robinson has been denied direct access to social media. Prisoners have access to the internet only in a supervised environment, and only for rehabilitative purposes.</p> \n<p>Imprisonment is unlikely to result in Robinson being silenced. His social media accounts have carried \u201cadmin posts\u201d in the past few days, including a message of thanks from Robinson to \u201ceveryone who has sent him money for prison spends, also for money towards his legal representation, he is incredibly grateful for your support\u201d.</p> \n<p>Ezra Levant, the Canadian founder of Rebel News, a rightwing website with wealthy backers, has <a href=\"https://www.rebelnews.com/tommy_robinson_sentenced_to_18_months_in_prison_will_serve_9\">promised to visit Robinson regularly in prison</a>, and report back. He told readers: \u201cIf they can jail Tommy Robinson, they can jail you, too.\u201d</p> \n<p>Robinson\u2019s supporters are expected to organise \u201cFree Tommy\u201d rallies in the coming months. A win for Trump in the upcoming US presidential election may also open unknown doors, especially as the longtime Trump acolyte Steve Bannon, a known admirer of Robinson\u2019s, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/29/steve-bannon-released-from-prison-early-a-week-before-us-election\">released from prison this week</a>.</p> \n<p>Robinson presents a problem for the prison service. \u201cThe decisions around how and where Robinson will be held are fraught with difficulty for prison bosses,\u201d said Ian Acheson, a counter-extremism adviser and former prison governor.</p> \n<p>Robinson\u2019s supporters report that he is being held in a segregated unit in Belmarsh prison for his own safety. They claim he is at risk of attack from Muslim prisoners.</p> \n<p>Acheson warned that attempts were being made to propagandise his imprisonment, and misinformation about his treatment was already spreading on social media. The Tommy Robinson propaganda machine seems unlikely to go away.</p>",

It had electrodes dotted all over it to measure my brain activity, and the gel being squeezed into the holes aided the connection between electrode and scalp.</p> <p>I was playing a small part in a pioneering five-year research project, <a href=\"https://neurolive.info/\">Neurolive</a>. Run by cognitive neuroscientist Dr Guido Orgs from University College London and choreographer Matthias Sperling, it brings together neuroscience and dance to investigate what\u2019s happening in our brains when we watch live performance. The audience/guinea pigs, of which I was one, filed into the studio wired up to backpacks full of tech and watched a duet called Detective Work, where two performers danced out an abstract mystery dressed in suave green suits. I was very aware of being monitored. I\u2019m a dance critic, and it felt as if I was being tested. Would my brain do the right thing?</p> <p>Dance neuroscience is a young field of study, partly because of the obvious difficulty of putting a dancer (or audience member) into a brain scanner \u2013 although some have tried: one study had a dancer move their legs in tango positions while lying in a 3D body scanner. Most research has relied on subjects watching videos, but the advent of mobile electroencephalography (EEG) has opened up the possibility of capturing the brain\u2019s electrical activity in situ, and Neurolive is the first study of its type at this scale, measuring up to 23 brains at once.</p>    <p>When we meet in October this year to discuss the project, Orgs tells me the idea first occured when the first affordable virtual reality systems emerged, with technology that claimed to be \u201cas good as reality, or better\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWell, from a scientific perspective, we don\u2019t even know how good reality is \u2013 we can\u2019t measure it,\u201d Orgs had thought. So he and Sperling set out to try to understand \u201cliveness\u201d, using dance as their subject matter.</p> <p>In Detective Work, Orgs was looking for inter-brain synchrony, when people\u2019s brain activity aligns, signalling that they\u2019re focusing on the same thing. The piece\u2019s choreographer, Seke Chimutengwende, was asked to predict when these moments of tight focus would occur, and the data showed he was almost spot on across all three shows (one takeaway: choreographers do know what they\u2019re doing). What was unexpected was that they imagined seeing that activity in the alpha band, a relatively fast frequency of brainwaves associated with paying attention (in a lecture, for example), but what they saw was the much slower delta waves. \u201cDelta band activity is associated with internal concentration, meditation and tuning into each other during social interactions,\u201d says Orgs, suggesting the experience was like \u201ccollective daydreaming\u201d.</p> <p>As well as our brainwaves being measured, participants filled in a questionnaire afterwards on what we\u2019d seen. A common response was \u201cconfusion\u201d, contemporary dance being an art form some find opaque. But what\u2019s fascinating is that whether people loved or hated the performance, knew what was going on or not, or were a dance critic overthinking things, their brains all followed a shared pattern. The study also found greater synchrony between people who attended the same performance versus those who sat in the same seat at the next show. As any performer will tell you, the energy in the auditorium can feel different each night even when the show\u2019s the same, and the data proved it. \u201cIn other words, it may not be so important to get the most expensive seats,\u201d Orgs says. \u201cWhat matters is to attend a dance performance live and together with others.\u201d</p>    <p>I only took part in the first performance, but since then Neurolive has collaborated with the dance collective Dog Kennel Hill Project and choreographer Jia-Yu Corti, and \u2013 one that I\u2019m sad to have missed \u2013 hosted a 16-hour performance, masterminded by choreographer<strong> </strong>Jo Fong and featuring 50 dancers across two days, where the audience wore eye-movement sensors as well as EEG caps. The data from these phases has not been fully crunched yet, but the feedback after Fong\u2019s show suggested that, much more than whether someone is technically a \u201cgood\u201d dancer or not, what matters is connection. \u201cLiterally, the more I look at you, the more connected I feel,\u201d Orgs says.</p> <p>Those delta waves that Orgs was talking about come up again when I video call New York butoh dancer Vangeline to discuss another performance created in collaboration with neuroscience, The Slowest Wave. Butoh emerged in Japan in the 1960s, a dance form most often associated with white-painted faces and bodies and almost painfully slow movement. Vangeline will tell you it\u2019s a lot more than that. It\u2019s a dance generated from inside the body (rather than steps imposed from outside) with performers tapping into emotional and transformational states. \u201cIt became obvious to me that butoh is a different state of consciousness,\u201d she says. She instigated the project, wanting to know if the science bore that out. What was actually happening in her brain?</p> <p>Rather than tracking the audience, this time it was the dancers; the first time five had been measured at once (Vangeline is bringing a solo version, minus EEG, to the <a href=\"https://thebowesmuseum.org.uk/whats-on/the-slowest-wave/\">Bowes Museum in Barnard Castle on 23 November</a>). Navigating the practicalities was half the challenge; the fact that sweat could meddle with the connections, and how to safely wear the hardware. \u201cEach thing on our head was worth $150,000,\u201d says Vangeline. \u201cIt was like: Don\u2019t break it!\u201d The data is still being cleaned up (a huge job, according to Constantina Theofanopoulou, who led the study, having to remove eye-blinks and head movements), but as it was happening they were able to show synchrony between the dancers in real time. \u201cYou might have a sense that you\u2019re connected with someone,\u201d says scientist Sadye Paez, who collaborated on the study, \u201cbut we can show that this magic is actually happening.\u201d</p>        <p>Once the results are completed \u2013 a frustratingly slow process \u2013 Vangeline is eager to expand the research. She\u2019d love to work with ageing butoh masters in Japan. \u201cIt would be amazing to have an archive of the brains of our teachers, for future generations,\u201d she says. But as well as artistic curiosity, she is interested in the health applications of this research, the possibility of using butoh to \u201ccalm the nervous system of a society that\u2019s really hyper-aroused, overly stressed\u201d. Having taught for 22 years, and worked with people with PTSD, she says, \u201cit\u2019s obvious to me that there are great healing benefits\u201d.</p> <p>When Orgs says: \u201cI really want to showcase the power of dance,\u201d he means both in an aesthetic sense and for wellbeing, too. One field where there is promising progress, for example, is dance interventions for people with Parkinson\u2019s. \u201cAnd there are a number of studies showing that dance is more powerful than exercise and medication to alleviate depressive symptoms,\u201d says Orgs. The tendency in science, he adds, is to research simpler things like walking or running, because they\u2019re easily controlled. \u201cBut they\u2019re not the most powerful interventions, so there is a need to better understand the complexity through projects like this.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s so much more to learn. \u201cEven though the technology is so advanced, it is still only able to access a fraction of what we\u2019re actually experiencing,\u201d says Sperling. Paez notes: \u201cIf we can\u2019t describe dance using science, to me that\u2019s an indication that the science is the problem. There are different ways of knowing, and just because we can\u2019t describe it using the scientific method doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not valid truth. We just haven\u2019t developed the technology or methods to do it.\u201d</p> <p>The final Neurolive show, which takes place this month, is a piece by Sperling called <a href=\"https://www.siobhandavies.com/events/neurolive-never-written/\">Readings of What Was Never Written</a>. It\u2019s based on the idea of \u201ctaking a reading\u201d, in both the scientific sense and the more magical sense, like reading palms or tarot cards. Sperling is not advocating tarot over science, but he sees how certain types of knowledge \u2013 rationality, logic, language \u2013 are held in highest esteem, and hopes that this project will show that dancers have different kinds of embodied intelligence and intuition that can be just as precise.</p> <p>As someone who writes about dance for a living, I know the feeling of revelation when you\u2019re watching a performance and suddenly things seem to fall into place, its secrets materialising. And I also know the struggle to put that into words after the show. The \u201cknowing\u201d can happen in the moment; it\u2019s something you sense, bypassing language.

In essence, he\u2019s saying conflicts of interest not only need to be seen to be declared, they require action beyond mere declaration to ensure they don\u2019t infect the course of deliberations. Robertson and Furness found Brereton failed on the latter.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/21/sign-up-for-five-great-reads-guardian-australias-wrap-of-our-best-summer-stories\">Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Furness commissioned Robertson to examine the entrails of the Nacc\u2019s robodebt decision after being deluged by public complaints. Robertson finds that Brereton made repeated conflict-of-interest declarations that he knew Person 1 well. Variously, he pledged not to be involved in \u201cdecision-making\u201d or in \u201cany decisions\u201d concerning Person 1 and said that should a matter potentially affecting their interests arise, he would \u201crecuse\u201d himself. That last assurance was made in writing to the attorney general.</p> <p>Robertson finds that Brereton\u2019s practise did not match his assurances.</p> <p>He notes the particular declaration Brereton made to his Nacc colleagues was caveated.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, I will retain an overall interest in the policy questions that arise concerning these referrals generally, because those questions \u2013 particular [sic] the scope of \u2018corrupt conduct\u2019 \u2013 will necessarily have ongoing ramifications for us,\u201d he wrote to them in a conflict declaration email on 7 July last year, the day after receiving Holmes\u2019 referrals.</p> <p>In his now public report, Robertson reproduces excerpts from the minutes of meetings that laid significant groundwork for the eventual decision not to proceed. At the key meeting on 19 October last year, the minutes record Brereton as promising to \u201clisten to the discussion and then leave\u201d. He appointed one of his deputies as the decision-maker and is recorded as saying he would \u201cmake some general observations\u201d before leaving.</p> <p>The minutes show he then led a discussion in which he suggested they initially \u201cpark\u201d the issue of Person 6 \u2013 the only referred person who was not a public servant \u2013 and discuss the other five as they were all in the same category. He then went on to detail internal legal advice \u2013 which Robertson found contained details he should not have accessed \u2013 on whether the conduct Holmes had identified was within the scope of \u201ccorrupt conduct\u201d. The advice had found it was, but this was \u201cnot free from doubt\u201d.</p> <p>Brereton, the minutes reveal, warned any corruption finding from the Nacc would probably face legal challenge.

      "bodyText": "One of the last election\u2019s key themes is having an uncomfortable renaissance. Integrity is, again, the issue de jour. There\u2019s a synergy between two of this week\u2019s biggest political issues: the potential implications of politicians receiving corporate favours and the National Anti-Corruption Commission\u2019s handling of the robodebt royal commission referrals. The through-line is conflicts of interest and how they should be managed versus how they often are. The retired judge Alan Robertson SC\u2019s findings about the process that led to the Nacc\u2019s decision not to investigate the six as-yet unnamed individuals referred to it by the royal commissioner, Catherine Holmes SC, should alarm anyone who believes reality should match rhetoric on matters of integrity and corruption. In a slightly understated legal manner, Robertson excoriates the Nacc \u2013 primarily its commissioner, Paul Brereton \u2013 for operating on the apparent belief that simply declaring a conflict of interest was enough to obviate the risk of it distorting the decision-making process. \u201cThere is a real difference between saying that a person will not be the decision-maker and the person will not be involved in decision making about an individual,\u201d Robertson writes in his report to the Nacc inspector, Gail Furness. \u201cThe issue is one of substance rather than form, consistent with the objective nature of the question through the eyes of the third party observer.\u201d In a statement, Nacc noted the report contained \u201cno finding of intentional wrongdoing or other impropriety\u201d. Brereton accepted his judgment in this respect \u201chas been found to be mistaken and takes sole responsibility for the mistake\u201d. It\u2019s reminiscent of the old thing about justice being done and being seen to be done \u2013 except it\u2019s in reverse. In essence, he\u2019s saying conflicts of interest not only need to be seen to be declared, they require action beyond mere declaration to ensure they don\u2019t infect the course of deliberations. Robertson and Furness found Brereton failed on the latter. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads Furness commissioned Robertson to examine the entrails of the Nacc\u2019s robodebt decision after being deluged by public complaints. Robertson finds that Brereton made repeated conflict-of-interest declarations that he knew Person 1 well. Variously, he pledged not to be involved in \u201cdecision-making\u201d or in \u201cany decisions\u201d concerning Person 1 and said that should a matter potentially affecting their interests arise, he would \u201crecuse\u201d himself. That last assurance was made in writing to the attorney general. Robertson finds that Brereton\u2019s practise did not match his assurances. He notes the particular declaration Brereton made to his Nacc colleagues was caveated. \u201cHowever, I will retain an overall interest in the policy questions that arise concerning these referrals generally, because those questions \u2013 particular [sic] the scope of \u2018corrupt conduct\u2019 \u2013 will necessarily have ongoing ramifications for us,\u201d he wrote to them in a conflict declaration email on 7 July last year, the day after receiving Holmes\u2019 referrals. In his now public report, Robertson reproduces excerpts from the minutes of meetings that laid significant groundwork for the eventual decision not to proceed. At the key meeting on 19 October last year, the minutes record Brereton as promising to \u201clisten to the discussion and then leave\u201d. He appointed one of his deputies as the decision-maker and is recorded as saying he would \u201cmake some general observations\u201d before leaving. The minutes show he then led a discussion in which he suggested they initially \u201cpark\u201d the issue of Person 6 \u2013 the only referred person who was not a public servant \u2013 and discuss the other five as they were all in the same category. He then went on to detail internal legal advice \u2013 which Robertson found contained details he should not have accessed \u2013 on whether the conduct Holmes had identified was within the scope of \u201ccorrupt conduct\u201d. The advice had found it was, but this was \u201cnot free from doubt\u201d. Brereton, the minutes reveal, warned any corruption finding from the Nacc would probably face legal challenge. He raised the risk of the Nacc finding no misconduct and contradicting the royal commission, suggesting that reaching different conclusions was \u201cnot in the public interest\u201d. He said the royal commission had been thorough and the Nacc was unlikely to find more. But it\u2019s the argument he is recorded as making next which is perhaps most astonishing. The minutes say Brereton noted that a corruption inquiry was usually \u201ca precursor to some kind of remedy elsewhere\u201d and that the commission couldn\u2019t provide a remedy itself. The royal commission had already exposed the conduct, and a remedy could be provided through a criminal prosecution or Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) code-of-conduct proceedings. \u201cThe Commissioner stated that all the Commission could do was make a finding that there was corrupt conduct and that he could not see where the Commission could add value,\u201d the minutes say. Let\u2019s just sit with that for a second. The Nacc had been operating for five days when Holmes\u2019 referrals were received in July last year. It took three months to get to the point of making a decision and would take months more to draft a press release and announce it. This was the first high-profile matter the newly constituted Nacc had to decide on and its commissioner was arguing there was no value in the anti-corruption commission investigating possible corruption \u2013 which is the entire reason it exists. The minutes record that he then said if the Nacc decided to take no further action, it would need to make a public statement, and it might be difficult to explain that they were proceeding to investigate Person 6 but not the others. The minutes indicate Brereton then stayed listening to the ensuing discussion before leaving while the others made their decision. Initially, it was to take no further action against the five public servants, flagging consultations with the APSC about its intended course. But later that day, the deputised decision-maker emailed a colleague saying she believed the decision should be the same for all six. Robertson noted a similarity between the reasons ultimately given for the decision not to investigate and the arguments Brereton had made. The APSC subsequently conducted its own separate investigation into two former departmental secretaries, Kathryn Campbell and Ren\u00e9e Leon, and made findings against them. In August this year, just a month before those findings were announced, the Albanese government passed retrospective legislation to ensure the APSC had the power to do what it was doing \u2013 investigate people who were no longer public servants. In relation to the Nacc, Robertson\u2019s job wasn\u2019t to adjudicate on the robodebt decision itself, but on the process that led to it. He found the law required action be taken as a result of the commissioner\u2019s disclosures and the absence of it amounted to \u201cofficer misconduct\u201d. Furness determined it wasn\u2019t just a procedural mistake but an error of judgment that affected procedural fairness. \u201cTo state otherwise is to seek to minimise the seriousness of the finding and, again, to minimise form over substance,\u201d Furness writes in her conclusion, endorsing the finding against the leader of the national integrity body. On Furness\u2019s recommendation, the referrals decision will now be revisited, the decision-making power delegated to \u201can appropriate person\u201d. The core principle here \u2013 that simply declaring is not enough \u2013 is applicable to the handling of conflicts of interest elsewhere. For example, the parliamentary registers of members and senators\u2019 interests, where politicians declare major assets and gifts received, real or in kind, are designed to aid transparency and prevent corrupt behaviour. But the entries are mostly basic and frequently outdated and omit any context that might more effectively allay concerns about propriety \u2013 or generate them. Besides the media, nobody really polices the disclosures, and there is no penalty for transgression besides shaming. Perhaps it\u2019s also time for an independent examination of that process to see if it\u2019s working as intended. Because the only thing worse than having no process to guard against corruption is having one that does it in name only. Karen Middleton is Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor",

      "body": "  <p>Personal branding has undergone a radical rebranding. The way we showcase ourselves in the workplace and jobs market has been transformed by the tools at our disposal and societal shifts, such as the melding of work and life.

Your reputation may have enhanced your prospects but, when it came to job hunting, your qualifications and CV were pretty much the only showcase you had.</p> <p>With the internet everything changed \u2013 and then changed again with social media and smartphones. Suddenly, you were visible to millions of people on a device they carried around in their pockets. Those same tools gave you the ability to step up from CVs to slickly presented websites and slide decks. And social media gave everyone a platform to build and manage their own personal brand in real time.</p> <p>Today, we\u2019re looking at another major change as ever more sophisticated tools enable anyone to create near-professional visual and video content on their smartphones. Meanwhile, platforms and social channels continue to proliferate and technologies such as artificial intelligence hold out once-unimaginable possibilities.</p> <p>So, what are the rules for personal branding in our radically new world?</p> <p><strong>Do use new tools<br></strong>A good personal brand takes the best parts of you and what you offer and packages them in a way that appeals to your audience, says personal branding expert Jennifer Holloway. \u201cUsing tools to enhance that packaging can really add impact, whether that\u2019s creating your own website with polished images and a slick video, or posting engaging content to social media platforms, or producing cleverly designed marketing materials.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019ve all instinctively stepped up our visual skills thanks to the photo editing tools on our smartphones and the widespread use of images, memes and gifs on social media. Of course, this raises the playing field when it comes to packaging your personal brand: the better everyone becomes, the slicker you need to be to stand out from the crowd. Apps that allow you to create any content you want, such as <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/uk/express/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adobe Express</a> can be a game-changer in this regard, helping you to create eye-catching designs easily, quickly and for free. They also allow you to easily embrace newer design features that use generative AI.</p> <p><strong>Do be natural \u2013 but also true<br></strong>\u201cThe best personal brands don\u2019t feel overly curated, they effortlessly capture someone\u2019s personality and the parts of them that make them unique,\u201d says Daisy Morris, an Adobe Express evangelist and author of Community Is Your Currency. \u201cNo one can replicate your own individual story, it\u2019s what makes you different and memorable.\u201d Of course, while we all know it\u2019s important to be authentic, that buzzword has become so ubiquitous and wooly. It can be difficult to pin down what being authentic actually means in practice in today\u2019s workplace and jobs market. Striving for an authentic look can sometimes feel contrived, or create a conflict between being your real self and the best version of yourself.</p> <p>Holloway says that while you should certainly highlight the best parts of yourself, you should be extra mindful to make sure everything you say is true and accurate. \u201cDoing otherwise can lead to problems down the line, when what people think they\u2019ve been buying into turns out to be untrue,\u201d she says. \u201cThe aim is that, however people come into contact with your personal brand, they\u2019re getting a taste of what they\u2019d receive if they were to encounter you in person.\u201d</p>    <p><strong>Do experiment<br></strong>Not everything will work for everyone, so try different mediums, platforms and channels and figure out what works best for you. \u201cYou could start on LinkedIn, by writing a newsletter or Substack, or go for written content on Instagram with visually designed carousels using Adobe Express,\u201d says Morris. Research the channels and focus your efforts. \u201cIt\u2019s better to commit to one or two channels and really go for it, rather than try and spread yourself thin and build a presence on all of them, and ultimately diluting the impact of your personality and your unique message,\u201d she says.</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t feel you have to share everything<br></strong>We are often encouraged to \u201cbring our whole selves to work\u201d and told that opening up and displaying vulnerability helps build relationships. But it\u2019s OK to keep parts of your life private. Think about what you want your personal brand to be. Some people love openness, others take a strictly professional approach. If your personal brand is to work for you, it needs to be something you feel comfortable with.</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t expect overnight successes<br></strong>Social media encourages the idea of zero-to-hero successes, but those whose personal brands really work have almost always put the hours in. So, take your time, stick with it and don\u2019t be disheartened if you don\u2019t have a million followers in your first month. \u201cAllow yourself time to experiment with your content, don\u2019t succumb to the narrative of \u2018overnight success\u2019, which can often be glorified on social media,\u201d says Morris. \u201cUse the block and mute button if you need to. There is no shame in shutting out unhelpful noise.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Do learn from others<br></strong>Look at people who do it well and take inspiration from them. Today\u2019s world of personal branding is so dynamic thanks to evolving tech and best practices, it\u2019s important to stay up to date with how other people are raising their game.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://servedby.flashtalking.com/click/1/250188;8780126;4938336;211;0/?gdpr=$%7BGDPR%7D&amp;gdpr_consent=$%7BGDPR_CONSENT_78%7D&amp;us_privacy=$%7BUS_PRIVACY%7D&amp;url=39967969\" rel=\"nofollow\">Find out more</a> about Adobe Express</em></p>",

Do use new tools A good personal brand takes the best parts of you and what you offer and packages them in a way that appeals to your audience, says personal branding expert Jennifer Holloway. \u201cUsing tools to enhance that packaging can really add impact, whether that\u2019s creating your own website with polished images and a slick video, or posting engaging content to social media platforms, or producing cleverly designed marketing materials.\u201d We\u2019ve all instinctively stepped up our visual skills thanks to the photo editing tools on our smartphones and the widespread use of images, memes and gifs on social media. Of course, this raises the playing field when it comes to packaging your personal brand: the better everyone becomes, the slicker you need to be to stand out from the crowd. Apps that allow you to create any content you want, such as Adobe Express can be a game-changer in this regard, helping you to create eye-catching designs easily, quickly and for free. They also allow you to easily embrace newer design features that use generative AI. Do be natural \u2013 but also true \u201cThe best personal brands don\u2019t feel overly curated, they effortlessly capture someone\u2019s personality and the parts of them that make them unique,\u201d says Daisy Morris, an Adobe Express evangelist and author of Community Is Your Currency. \u201cNo one can replicate your own individual story, it\u2019s what makes you different and memorable.\u201d Of course, while we all know it\u2019s important to be authentic, that buzzword has become so ubiquitous and wooly. It can be difficult to pin down what being authentic actually means in practice in today\u2019s workplace and jobs market. Striving for an authentic look can sometimes feel contrived, or create a conflict between being your real self and the best version of yourself. Holloway says that while you should certainly highlight the best parts of yourself, you should be extra mindful to make sure everything you say is true and accurate. \u201cDoing otherwise can lead to problems down the line, when what people think they\u2019ve been buying into turns out to be untrue,\u201d she says. \u201cThe aim is that, however people come into contact with your personal brand, they\u2019re getting a taste of what they\u2019d receive if they were to encounter you in person.\u201d Do experiment Not everything will work for everyone, so try different mediums, platforms and channels and figure out what works best for you. \u201cYou could start on LinkedIn, by writing a newsletter or Substack, or go for written content on Instagram with visually designed carousels using Adobe Express,\u201d says Morris. Research the channels and focus your efforts. \u201cIt\u2019s better to commit to one or two channels and really go for it, rather than try and spread yourself thin and build a presence on all of them, and ultimately diluting the impact of your personality and your unique message,\u201d she says. Don\u2019t feel you have to share everything We are often encouraged to \u201cbring our whole selves to work\u201d and told that opening up and displaying vulnerability helps build relationships. But it\u2019s OK to keep parts of your life private. Think about what you want your personal brand to be. Some people love openness, others take a strictly professional approach. If your personal brand is to work for you, it needs to be something you feel comfortable with. Don\u2019t expect overnight successes Social media encourages the idea of zero-to-hero successes, but those whose personal brands really work have almost always put the hours in. So, take your time, stick with it and don\u2019t be disheartened if you don\u2019t have a million followers in your first month. \u201cAllow yourself time to experiment with your content, don\u2019t succumb to the narrative of \u2018overnight success\u2019, which can often be glorified on social media,\u201d says Morris. \u201cUse the block and mute button if you need to. There is no shame in shutting out unhelpful noise.\u201d Do learn from others Look at people who do it well and take inspiration from them. Today\u2019s world of personal branding is so dynamic thanks to evolving tech and best practices, it\u2019s important to stay up to date with how other people are raising their game.

It is better not to try our luck again and anger Moscow,\u201d said Levan. He voted for the increasingly anti-liberal Georgian Dream (GD) party.

He said he was worried the opposition would pull Georgia into a Ukraine-style conflict. Others in his hometown seemed to share his concerns \u2013 GD won 57% of votes in Gori.</p> <p>In the weeks leading up to the elections, the ruling party displayed crude <a href=\"https://x.com/KShoshiashvili/status/1839203326342172897\">billboards</a> across Tbilisi that featured images of bombed-out Ukrainian churches and sports arenas contrasted with idyllic scenes from Georgia.</p>    <p>Speaking in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, Sergiu, who has retired from the military, said he voted in the country\u2019s 20 October presidential election for the Moscow-friendly socialist candidate, Alexandr Stoianoglo, who advocates for better relations with Russia.</p> <p>Sergiu said it was naive to believe that Moscow would allow Moldova to join the EU. \u201cRussia wants to keep us under their control forever.

When the invasion in Ukraine prompted Moscow to reduce imports of French and Italian wines, it turned to Georgian wine, resulting in a profitable surge in exports for Georgia.</p> <p>In Moldova, some still yearn for the days of affordable Russian gas after Gazprom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/25/russias-gazprom-to-make-drastic-cut-to-europes-gas-supply-from-wednesday\">slashed supplies</a> to the country by a third and demanded more than double the previous rates to maintain the flow, a move that was widely seen as political payback for Sandu\u2019s pro-western stance.

The lawsuit seeking damages was filed in a US district court in Amarillo, northern Texas, which is presided over by a judge, Matthew Kacsmaryk, who has a track record of friendly rulings to rightwing legal filings. It came after Trump said that CBS should lose its license to broadcast news over the interview. The former president lashed out after the interview, which aired on 7 October, featured a different, more concise version of the vice-president\u2019s answer to a question on Israel and the war in Gaza than had appeared in the trailer. In the finalised interview, Harris \u2013 on being asked if Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, listened to US advice \u2013 answered: \u201cWe are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States \u2013 to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.\u201d An alternative edit, feature in earlier pre-broadcast promotions, had Harris giving a longer response.

It is not unusual for broadcast outlets to cut interview answers for reasons of timing and conciseness. A CBS spokesperson dismissed Trump\u2019s action as \u201ccompletely without merit\u201d in a statement issued to the Hill. \u201cThe interview was not doctored; and 60 Minutes did not hide any part of the vice-president\u2019s answer to the question at issue. 60 Minutes fairly presented the interview to inform the viewing audience, and not to mislead it,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe lawsuit Trump has brought today against CBS is completely without merit and we will vigorously defend against it.\u201d Trump\u2019s call for the network to be stripped of its licence was condemned by the Federal Communications Commission, the US broadcast regulator, as a \u201cthreat against free speech\u201d.

      "bodyText": "An obsessed and jealous teenager who stabbed his ex-girlfriend to death in an alleyway has been detained for life and told he will serve a minimum of 17 years. Logan MacPhail murdered 15-year-old Holly Newton in Hexham, Northumberland, in January 2023. He stabbed her 36 times after he stalked her for an hour as she walked with friends after school. On Friday, Mr Justice Hilliard described the attack on Holly as \u201cvicious and brutal\u201d. Newcastle crown court heard that MacPhail, who was 16 at the time of the murder and is now 17, had been Holly\u2019s first and only boyfriend and at the start it was \u201ca typical teenage relationship\u201d. But MacPhail became obsessed with Holly, wanting to know where she was and who she was going out with. Holly\u2019s mother, Micala Trussler, said her daughter was a victim of domestic abuse. He killed Holly, from Haltwhistle, Northumberland, after she tried to break up with him. The judge said the relationship between MacPhail and Holly had \u201cits ups and downs\u201d but was nothing out of the ordinary.When Holly indicated the relationship was over \u201cyou were not able to accept that. You were obsessed by Holly\u201d, he said. MacPhail lured Holly into an alleyway with the specific aim of attacking her where other people could not intervene, he said. \u201cYou were filled with resentment and jealousy but still able to calculate where you could best attack her and able to wait until you got that opportunity.\u201d Hilliard said the attack had lasted a minute or so and included stab wounds to her head. It meant Holly\u2019s mother was prevented from seeing her daughter because of the \u201chorrifying condition she was in\u201d. Trussler spoke at the sentencing hearing of being unable to hug, kiss or even touch her daughter because she was \u201ca crime scene, she was evidence\u201d. Hilliard said: \u201cThe stark facts are that you made a conscious decision to stab a 15-year-old girl to death with a knife that you were carrying unlawfully in a public place having followed her secretly around town for an hour, all because your relationship with her had ended. \u201cYou were jealous of the fact she might see someone else. \u201cWhat happened in this case should not happen to any child or any parent.\u201d Speaking of the family\u2019s loss, the judge said: \u201cAll those years ahead for a 15-year-old girl that she and they will never see.\u201d MacPhail also stabbed a boy who tried to intervene to help Holly. The boy stood up in court to deliver a victim impact statement in which he said he was struggling with his mental health and found it difficult to concentrate. The court heard that the night before he murdered Holly, MacPhail had travelled 40 miles from his home to hers and hung around for hours. He was eventually taken home by police who had been alerted by his mother that he was missing. MacPhail, from Gateshead, has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and has learning difficulties, but the judge said he was sure he knew what he was doing. Nigel Edwards KC, defending, said MacPhail\u2019s progress since being in secure accommodation has been \u201cmeteoric\u201d. The judge told MacPhail: \u201cI am sure you can make further progress if you continue to try whilst you are in custody, you can definitely do better than you sometimes think.\u201d Holly\u2019s family believe she was a victim of MacPhail\u2019s controlling behaviour and domestic abuse, but she is too young for it to be categorised that way. Trussler told the court: \u201cI do not agree that only those over the age of 16 can be victims of domestic abuse and I will use Holly\u2019s experience to petition for change. \u201cI firmly believe that Logan thought if he couldn\u2019t have Holly, then no one else could.\u201d Susan Dungworth, the police and crime commissioner for Northumbria, backed the family\u2019s call for a law change. \u201cWe need an urgent review of current legislation and how the system can better protect young victims in coercive, controlling and abusive relationships,\u201d she said. MacPhail claimed he never planned to attack Holly but wanted to use the knife to kill himself. He denied murder but admitted manslaughter, claiming he blacked out, but a jury rejected his story after a six-week trial.",

Last month, the large French alpine ski resort Alpe du Grand Serre in the Is\u00e8re announced it had been forced to close because it could not afford to become a year-round destination to offset its shorter winter season. Finns have used sawdust to preserve snow for decades, including for winter sports.

Authorities in Valencia raised the death toll on Friday afternoon in what have been the deadliest floods in Spain\u2019s modern history. The state weather agency Aemet said early on Friday that four regions, including Valencia, remained on amber alert because of the risk of rain and storms, days after rivers of mud-coloured water left a trail of devastation. The flash floods swept away bridges, cars and streetlights. The number of missing people remains unknown. Thousands more have no access to water or reliable food, while parts of the heaviest-hit areas remain inaccessible. The piles of vehicles and debris have trapped some residents in their homes while others are without electricity or stable phone service. \u201cThis is a disaster,\u201d a resident of hard-hit Paiporta told the broadcaster RTVE as he fought back tears. \u201cPeople can\u2019t imagine what this is like, you see images on television but this is three times worse ...

Roger Barker, the director of policy at the Institute of Directors, said: \u201cEven before the chancellor had risen to deliver her budget speech, the confidence of business leaders had hit its lowest level since December 2022. Based on the results of our snap post-budget poll, it seems likely that sentiment will have deteriorated even further. \u201cBy imposing significant new tax burdens on business, the government has taken a major risk with the economic recovery. The viability of its future spending plans will be compromised if growth is now snuffed out.\u201d The ratings agency Moody\u2019s said the budget would do little to improve Britain\u2019s economic growth, and said Reeves\u2019s plans to add to government borrowing in the near-term would pose an \u201cadditional challenge\u201d to repairing the public finances. It comes as the yield \u2013 in effect the interest rate \u2013 on 10-year government bonds stabilised on Friday morning. The government\u2019s borrowing costs on financial markets had risen sharply over the previous two days since Wednesday\u2019s budget to trade above 4.5%, the highest level this year. City analysts said the reaction was driven by Reeves\u2019s plans to add to the UK\u2019s borrowing levels and the prospect of the Bank of England cutting interest rates by less than previously anticipated. With markets in a delicate position ahead of the US election next week, they also warned investors remained wary of Britain after Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget. \u201cWe expect financial markets to remain more sensitive to the potential for UK policy missteps, because of the gilt market turmoil that followed the September 2022 mini budget,\u201d Moody\u2019s said in a note to clients. Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government was in a \u201cvery different world\u201d from the market panic two years ago, but suggested that there were lasting consequences. \u201cI think we\u2019ve all got PTSD from Liz Truss,\u201d he told Sky News. The Bank of England is expected to cut its base rate from 5% to 4.75% on Thursday next week. The central bank will publish updated growth forecasts, taking account of the chancellor\u2019s budget. Leading economists and business leaders said the government could struggle to turn around Britain\u2019s growth prospects after announcing large tax rises on businesses and plans for public investment that would take years to pay off. The latest snapshot from the manufacturing sector show that factory output fell in October as worried industrial firms braced for the budget. The purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for the sector slumped into contraction, according to the survey of manufacturing bosses compiled before the tax and spending event.",

Elon Musk, Trump\u2019s wealthiest backer and surrogate, posted the map to his 202 million followers on his own X platform, proclaiming: \u201cThe trend will continue.\u201d Trump and Musk have also promoted online betting platforms, which have bolstered the impression of a surge for the Republican candidate stemming from hefty bets on him winning. A small number of high-value wagers from four accounts linked to a French national appeared to be responsible for $28m gambled on a Trump victory on the Polymarket platform, the New York Times reported. Trump referenced the Polymarket activity in a recent speech. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell it means, but it means we\u2019re doing pretty well,\u201d he said.",

It\u2019s quite the feat, seeing as they\u2019re standing 6ft away, using a long-handled litter picker to grip the marker.

But I wasn\u2019t subjected to violence, largely speaking. There was probably only one moment when I thought I was in any real danger \u2013 but I live to tell the tale.\u201d</p> <p>This is the reality of being the host on the first child-based version of comedy behemoth Taskmaster. Greg Davies is gone, replaced as the show\u2019s figurehead by Starstruck creator and standup <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/oct/15/rose-matafeo-taylor-swift-standup-junior-taskmaster\">Rose Matafeo</a>. Instead of Alex Horne, Wozniak, a podcaster, comic and co-star of Davies\u2019s sitcom Man Down, provides the contestant-enraging levels of pedantry as the task-setting assistant. The only other major difference is that it now takes place in heats, with different participants each week, two of whom go into the semi-finals. Well, that and the fact that none of the contestants have gone through puberty.</p> <p>There are children who have turned up in dazzling reflective shellsuits, cute martial artists who claim to have started their own coven and one child determined to evangelise about one of the world\u2019s least-loved birds, wearing a T-shirt that reads: \u201cI just really like pigeons, OK?\u201d It makes for TV full of wild digressions and the rattling off of leftfield facts in that endearingly obsessive way only kids can manage. It\u2019s adorable.</p>    <p>It also doesn\u2019t pull any punches. \u201cThe tasks for the kids\u2019 show would be completely usable on the adults\u2019 show,\u201d says Wozniak. \u201cThey haven\u2019t dumbed down anything at all.\u201d As a viewer, you might question that slightly \u2013 with shots of a shed packed with implements suggesting a greater availability of useful items than usual. Supposedly, though, this is just down to the calibre of contestant.</p> <p>\u201cThe props are actually quite similar. The kids\u2019 advantage is that they have better brains. They have not lived a life that has&nbsp;atrophied them or stunted their&nbsp;imaginations.\u201d</p> <p>Might we witness a contestant knock previous winner John Robins off his perch as the contestant <a href=\"https://taskmaster.info/insights/contestant-points-per-task.php?sh=1&amp;amp;ct=full\">with the highest average number of points per task</a>? \u201cOh yeah, John needs to watch his back,\u201d says Wozniak. \u201cThat crown is not resting easy. It\u2019s askew at best, and pretty soon some kids are going to bounce up and knock it off. He\u2019s not going to like it, but that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d</p> <p>Junior Taskmaster comes amid something of a new era for the Taskmaster brand. It has long been a ratings smash, and a hit international franchise \u2013 having racked up 2.3bn viewing minutes for Channel 4 in 2023, and the original being shown in more than 120 countries (plus local versions having been created in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Croatia, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark and Portugal). But the move into the kids\u2019 version comes alongside the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/oct/02/taskmaster-live-experience-tv\">launch of a live experience</a>, VR game and <a href=\"https://taskmastereducation.com/\">Taskmaster Education</a>, which helps run after-school clubs where show tasks are tweaked to aid learning. Not to mention products such as the board game and, erm, Christmas crackers. At the rate new twists on the format keep popping up, it\u2019s going to be the gameshow equivalent of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p> <p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s completely beyond Marvel! I don\u2019t see Marvel doing anything like Taskmaster Education,\u201d says Wozniak. \u201cIt knocks Marvel into a cocked hat!\u201d</p>    <p>It also has a lot more sass than anything conjured up by Stan Lee. Compared with the adult version, the level of backchat on Junior Taskmaster is through the roof. When the kids are shown slow-mo clips of them unwittingly breaking rules or belatedly realising they missed some secret instructions, they do not hold back. \u201cSometimes you just agitate me!\u201d one snaps at Wozniak. Another claims they are&nbsp;imagining his face while hurling&nbsp;objects at a target.</p> <p>\u201cAdults and children have a very different approach to sass,\u201d says the host. \u201cIf you\u2019re being sassy on TV, you might at some point think: \u2018Hang on, my Auntie Barbara might be watching.\u2019 The child is not thinking that way.<strong> </strong>Once a child has the taste of sass in its mouth, it&nbsp;launches into a sass feast. It cannot stop until it is exhausted.\u201d</p> <p>Was he taken aback by it at all?</p> <p>\u201cNo, children don\u2019t naturally respect me,\u201d laughs Wozniak, who&nbsp;has kids of his own \u2013 not that there\u2019s any chance of them appearing on the show. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to spend the day with me giving them instructions. That&nbsp;would be intolerable.\u201d</p> <p>If Wozniak talks with authority about Taskmaster, that\u2019s because he has earned it. He won the first version back in 2010, when it was an Edinburgh fringe show created by Alex Horne, and was called back to play the assistant the following year \u2013 albeit without much clue what he was meant to be doing (\u201cI&nbsp;think I just spent the show gazing into the middle distance with my mouth open\u201d). His appearance on season 11 of the TV version saw him become a fan favourite after shocking the hosts by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-YG_AkhvZw&amp;amp;t=570s\">shaving his hair into a mohican</a>. The moment when he tried so hard to complete a solo task with the sole instructions of \u201cfart\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8uAY2d1ADM&amp;amp;t=180s\">that he gave himself piles</a> has also gone down as one of the show\u2019s all-time most memorable moments.</p>    <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why, but for some reason, I didn\u2019t think this would come up,\u201d sighs Wozniak. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it? I mean, on the rare occasion that someone recognises me in the street, the first thing they\u2019ll ask me about is my bum. That, I&nbsp;suppose, is likely to be my legacy.\u201d</p> <p>It also belatedly kickstarted his career. Wozniak initially performed standup alongside a career as a junior hospital doctor, before becoming a full-time comic in 2008. He appeared as an accountant in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/oct/17/greg-davies-standup-sitcom-man-down\">Man Down</a> but, despite an assortment of TV appearances, <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/st-elwicks-neighbourhood-association-newsletter-podcast/id1484451923\">underrated podcasts</a>, Edinburgh shows and writing a <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5156932/\">30-minute silent Sky comedy starring Kim Cattrall</a> and a troupe of acrobats, he failed to hit the big time. But following Taskmaster, fans flocked to the excellent <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/threebeansalad?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAab31lY-lapCZTZomIeRT8heBrcGed15Ndb-_AjiVlnTvmT55LrDgUyaCyA_aem_XwVIz7-MWsEWvd7eNGaVVQ\">Three Bean Salad podcast</a> he co-hosts with Henry Paker and Benjamin Partridge \u2013 driving it into the upper echelons of Apple\u2019s podcast charts. It\u2019s rarely out of the Top 20 comedy podcast rankings, and in March this year it won best comedy podcast at the Chortle awards. Plus, of course, he\u2019s back on the Taskmaster set.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes it feel like it was all worthwhile, you know?\u201d he laughs. \u201cMany anguished months and years of pain and delicate self-care and a minor operation later.\u201d</p> <p>Sorry \u2013 did you really have to have a minor operation to fix a Taskmaster-related mishap?</p> <p>\u201cI did. Thank you for asking.\u201d</p>    <p>There should not, however, be any lasting damage to contestants on the new Taskmaster. Not only have they removed any overly sharp tools from the set, but the threat of lasting psychological injury has been removed by Rose Matafeo (who was also a contestant on series nine) being a far less aggressive host than Greg Davies. She\u2019s witty and barbed, but shies away from the scathing approach of&nbsp;its usual overlord.</p> <p>\u201cIt would never get past an ethics committee, sadly,\u201d says Wozniak. \u201cMy suspicion is that Rose, like a lot of us, is capable of great brutality. But she kept it in check.\u201d</p> <p>The show also comes with its own built-in support network: the other contestants. One of the joys of Junior Taskmaster is how sweet the children are to each other, particularly when it comes to their inter-task banter. They throw their heads back to guffaw at each other\u2019s jokes, or giggle helplessly at fellow participants\u2019 one-liners. So kind were they that one pair have formed a lasting friendship, keeping in touch via parents\u2019 phones across a&nbsp;250-mile distance.</p> <p>\u201cThere were one or two tears shed<strong> </strong>when people were knocked out.<strong> </strong>But what was really lovely to see is that they tended to be dried away very quickly by the other kids,\u201d says Wozniak. \u201cThey were far&nbsp;better at that side of things than&nbsp;the comedians.\u201d</p> <p>Given he\u2019s appeared on the show as an adult, does Wozniak ever wonder how he might have done if&nbsp;he\u2019d appeared as a child?</p> <p>\u201cWell, it would have been in the late 80s and the nation would not have been ready for a mustachioed nine-year-old,\u201d he says. \u201cI would have been treated very, very poorly&nbsp;\u2013 and probably gone into a&nbsp;life of crime. Thankfully, we\u2019re in&nbsp;a different era now.\u201d</p> <p><em>Junior Taskmaster is on Channel 4 on 8 November </em><em>at 8pm</em><em>.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "The US added just 12,000 jobs in October, the last snapshot of the employment market before election day, in a report heavily affected by the strike at Boeing and two recent hurricanes. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.1%. The closely watched jobs report is the last piece of economic news before next week\u2019s election. Many polls report that the economy is the top issue for voters. Economists had expected the temporary impacts from Hurricane Helene, Hurricane Milton and the ongoing strike by 33,000 Boeing workers in the Pacific north-west to reduce job growth numbers in October. But the number of jobs created was far lower than their estimate of 120,000 jobs for the month. The US jobs market has been cooling after years of robust growth. October\u2019s figure was the weakest since December 2020. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign seized on the weak growth figures. \u201cThis jobs report is a catastrophe and definitively reveals how badly Kamala Harris broke our economy,\u201d the Republican presidential campaign said in a statement. The White House\u2019s council of economic advisers moved to downplay the poor jobs growth figures blaming the \u201cdistortionary factors\u201d of the hurricanes and Boeing strike. The number of people not at work due to bad weather rose by 460,000 in October, it said. \u201cWhen the data signal gets jammed, look to the underlying trend,\u201d the council added in a blogpost. In a statement, Joe Biden blamed the October reading on storm \u201cdevastation\u201d and strikes. \u201cJob growth is expected to rebound in November as our hurricane recovery and rebuilding efforts continue,\u201d the US president said. The US economy \u201cremains strong, with 16 million jobs created since I took office\u201d, Biden added. \u201cThere\u2019s more work to do. We are working every day to lower costs for working families on rent, prescription drugs, health insurance, and child care.\u201d Job creation accelerated unexpectedly in September as the US added a revised 223,000 jobs, in the strongest month of jobs growth since March 2024. Until October the average number of jobs gained per month in 2024 has been about 200,000. Manufacturing jobs fell by 46,000 in October, probably led by the strike at Boeing \u2013 which may end next week when workers vote on a new deal. Leisure and hospitality \u2013 usually a major source of new jobs \u2013 dropped 4,000 positions. The latest report from the labor department also shaved a combined 112,000 jobs off August and September\u2019s hiring totals. \u201cIt is likely that payroll employment estimates in some industries were affected by the hurricanes; however, it is not possible to quantify the net effect on the over-the-month change in national employment, hours, or earnings estimates because the establishment survey is not designed to isolate effects from extreme weather events,\u201d the labor department reported. The continuing strength of the jobs market has surprised some economists who expected job losses as the Federal Reserve increased interest rates to tackle inflation. The US now seems to be heading towards a \u201csoft landing\u201d with interest rates falling, the rate of inflation slowing and employers still hiring. Inflation in the US hit a three-year low in August 2024, falling to its lowest level since February 2021, with the consumer price index annual rate at 2.5% ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s first cut to interest rates since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Polling, however, shows that Americans are deeply unhappy with the state of the economy and the cumulative price rises that they have experienced thanks to three years of high inflation. And while economic indicators have shown a resilient, strong economy, Republican elected officials and Trump have sought to portray the economy negatively. Trump has falsely claimed the US currently has \u201cthe worst economy ever\u201d. Last month, Biden pushed back on Republican claims that the last jobs report was fake, stating, \u201canything the Maga Republicans don\u2019t like, they call \u2018fake\u2019. Anything. The job numbers are what the job numbers are.\u201d",

Almost everyone in Utiel between the ages of five and 90 seems to be wielding a broom, and tractors, diggers, mini-diggers and farm vehicles beetle through the still-flooded streets offering help to anyone in need. \u201cThe solidarity people here in Utiel have shown has been amazing \u2013 and people have been risking their lives saving others,\u201d says Ricardo Gabald\u00f3n, who has been the town\u2019s mayor for the past 18 months. He sits, sleep-starved and anxious, in his town hall office, still palpably relieved that he gave the order to close Utiel\u2019s schools first thing on Tuesday. \u201cSix people died here, almost all of them were old and had reduced mobility,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there could have been hundreds of deaths here. Hundreds. People come here for school from nearby villages and they would have been hit when they were in their cars or the kids would have been in school when the waters came.\u201d Gabald\u00f3n\u2019s priorities are re-establishing power to parts of the town, making sure there is enough water for everyone, and helping the hundreds of people who have lost their homes, cars and livelihoods. Recovery, both economic and emotional, will take a long time. Aleixandre\u2019s sister, Carmen, is still trying to process events as she sweeps the water out of her parents\u2019 house. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what happened here,\u201d she says. \u201cI just don\u2019t have the words to describe it.\u201d Her brother, meanwhile, keeps returning to something his rescuers told him early on Wednesday. \u201cThis was all new for us, but the UME deal with disasters. But when they were getting us out of here by boat, they told us they\u2019d never seen anything like this in Spain. Ever.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>This moment of the year always feels like a key change in the song of life. The nights fall hard and fast now the clocks have changed. For a brief few days, the leaves underfoot are thick as shag carpet. The world is aglow with deep autumnal oranges and reds: pumpkins, then fireworks, then poppies. The mood music is shifting, the energy rising, as the year builds to a crescendo.</p> <p>What this means on a practical level is that it is time to get the winter store cupboards prepped \u2013 not just with food, but with all the essentials needed to get through the colder months.</p> <p>So, here\u2019s a few things on my radar this month. Two possibles if you are in the market for a new coat \u2013 one with an integral hoodie that could be an alternative to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/sep/20/introducing-the-scarf-coat-a-genuinely-new-style\">the scarf coats I wrote about in my column recently</a>. The only slippers you will ever need. And perhaps a treat or two (I can never resist an excellent earring). I\u2019m not for a moment suggesting you buy these things \u2013 you may not want anything. You might file away an idea for next year. Or something on my list might remind you about a treasure you can dig out of your own wardrobe. But here\u2019s a starter for 10.</p> <h2><strong>The perfect peacoat</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Double-breasted peacoat, \u00a3159</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/john-lewis-double-breasted-wool-blend-peacoat-black/camel/p111801430\"><sub>johnlewis.com</sub></a></p> <p>I cannot do justice to how excellent this coat is, and the photo doesn\u2019t either, but please take my word for it when I say it looks and feels delicious. Well-thought-out pockets and expensive-looking detailing (for instance, a concealed button to hold the collar in place). It\u2019s chunky, though, so not for you if you prefer a narrow silhouette or have a tendency to overheat.</p> <h2><strong>A brilliant party top</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Bandeau top, \u00a365</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.monsoon.co.uk/ava-tailored-bandeau-top-1000402394.html\"><sub>monsoon.co.uk</sub></a></p> <p>If I wasn\u2019t such an incredibly nice person I would keep it as my secret, but I\u2019m telling you because I love you: Monsoon makes marvellous party clothes. The silver dancing shoes I bought there last year have been a joy and <em>no one else has them</em>. This bandeau top with button front is fabulously Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy and available on a high street near you. You owe me one ladies.</p> <h2><strong>A chic phone wrist strap</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Beaded phone ropes, \u00a314</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.notanotherbill.com/products/beaded-phone-straps\"><sub>notanotherbill.com</sub></a></p> <p>I hate to say it, but a well-dressed phone is an essential part of your look these days. Please don\u2019t tell me you are still carrying yours in one of those leather wallets. Buy a sleek, simple silicone case with buffers to protect the screen and attach a wrist strap to keep it tethered to you \u2013 or your handbag \u2013 so that it can\u2019t get knocked (or nicked) out of your hand. These beads are nice. Mine are blue.</p> <h2><strong>The dinner knit</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Sweater with shoulder buttons, \u00a329.99</strong><br><a href=\"https://shop.mango.com/gb/en/p/women/sweaters-and-cardigans/sweaters/sweater-with-shoulder-buttons_77045641?c=99\"><sub>mango.com</sub></a></p> <p>I\u2019ve included a shopping link here just to show you what I\u2019m talking about, really, but this is a general style tip rather than an arrow towards any one item. A simple knitted sweater that has something a bit special enough to go out for dinner in is one of the most useful pieces in your wardrobe. Buttons at the shoulder are a more chic, understated detail than sparkles or a fancy trim. With jeans and hoop earrings this Mango number will take you anywhere.

      "bodyText": "This moment of the year always feels like a key change in the song of life. The nights fall hard and fast now the clocks have changed. For a brief few days, the leaves underfoot are thick as shag carpet. The world is aglow with deep autumnal oranges and reds: pumpkins, then fireworks, then poppies. The mood music is shifting, the energy rising, as the year builds to a crescendo. What this means on a practical level is that it is time to get the winter store cupboards prepped \u2013 not just with food, but with all the essentials needed to get through the colder months. So, here\u2019s a few things on my radar this month. Two possibles if you are in the market for a new coat \u2013 one with an integral hoodie that could be an alternative to the scarf coats I wrote about in my column recently. The only slippers you will ever need. And perhaps a treat or two (I can never resist an excellent earring). I\u2019m not for a moment suggesting you buy these things \u2013 you may not want anything. You might file away an idea for next year. Or something on my list might remind you about a treasure you can dig out of your own wardrobe. But here\u2019s a starter for 10. The perfect peacoat Double-breasted peacoat, \u00a3159 johnlewis.com I cannot do justice to how excellent this coat is, and the photo doesn\u2019t either, but please take my word for it when I say it looks and feels delicious. Well-thought-out pockets and expensive-looking detailing (for instance, a concealed button to hold the collar in place). It\u2019s chunky, though, so not for you if you prefer a narrow silhouette or have a tendency to overheat. A brilliant party top Bandeau top, \u00a365 monsoon.co.uk If I wasn\u2019t such an incredibly nice person I would keep it as my secret, but I\u2019m telling you because I love you: Monsoon makes marvellous party clothes. The silver dancing shoes I bought there last year have been a joy and no one else has them. This bandeau top with button front is fabulously Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy and available on a high street near you. You owe me one ladies. A chic phone wrist strap Beaded phone ropes, \u00a314 notanotherbill.com I hate to say it, but a well-dressed phone is an essential part of your look these days. Please don\u2019t tell me you are still carrying yours in one of those leather wallets. Buy a sleek, simple silicone case with buffers to protect the screen and attach a wrist strap to keep it tethered to you \u2013 or your handbag \u2013 so that it can\u2019t get knocked (or nicked) out of your hand. These beads are nice. Mine are blue. The dinner knit Sweater with shoulder buttons, \u00a329.99 mango.com I\u2019ve included a shopping link here just to show you what I\u2019m talking about, really, but this is a general style tip rather than an arrow towards any one item. A simple knitted sweater that has something a bit special enough to go out for dinner in is one of the most useful pieces in your wardrobe. Buttons at the shoulder are a more chic, understated detail than sparkles or a fancy trim. With jeans and hoop earrings this Mango number will take you anywhere.

Also, I have a soft spot for a heart-shaped earring. These are divine, darlings.

Casemiro\u2019s best days are behind him, leaving him regularly unable to cope with the pace of the Premier League and turning him into somewhat of a liability, and although Christian Eriksen has stepped up this season he still seems to be below the elite level United need to progress in the long term.

First job came at third-tier Casa Pia in Portugal where he developed his 3-4-3 formation and pressing style.&nbsp;Became Braga B coach in September 2019, and took over first team three months later. </p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Sporting success&nbsp;</b>In March 2020, Sporting paid \u20ac10m to recruit him. He led the club to first Portuguese title in 19 years in 2020-21, nurturing talents like&nbsp;Pedro Porro, Jo\u00e3o Palhinha, Matheus Nunes and Nuno Mendes. Amorim rebuilt Sporting to win title again in 2023-24, but was denied double by Porto in Ta\u00e7a de Portugal final.

They invested heavily in Rasmus H\u00f8jlund last season, seeing him as the ideal No&nbsp;9, but despite showing he has plenty of quality he is yet to find consistency in front of goal. Alejandro Garnacho is the club\u2019s top league goalscorer with a whopping two, with six colleagues below him on one each. United\u2019s xG (expected goals) in the league is&nbsp;15.65, indicating that consistently&nbsp;poor finishing is costing them. The summer signing Joshua Zirkzee does not look prolific and Marcus Rashford has failed to recapture the form that brought him 30 goals in 2022-23.</p> \n<h2><strong>Get the best out of </strong><strong>struggling&nbsp;players</strong></h2> \n<p>Speaking of Rashford, it is not solely his scoring that is an issue; he has struggled with all aspects of his game since the start of last season. No one doubts his quality at his best but he missed out on the European Championship on merit and needs someone to revitalise him because he would be an asset to any team if he can replicate the form of two seasons ago. Another who needs to do better is Antony, a player Ten Hag brought in at great expense but who has looked subpar, rarely offering an indication he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/sep/01/antony-completes-manchester-united-move-ajax\">was worth \u00a385.6m</a>. With Ten Hag gone, Antony has plenty to prove having become a bit-part player. No one has seen the best of Mason Mount since his arrival in 2023. Injury has been an issue but Ten Hag was unable to find a position for him.</p> \n<h2><strong>Create a recognisable and&nbsp;coherent style</strong></h2> \n<p>Ten Hag had 128 games and it was almost impossible to decipher the plan in the majority of those. Jason Wilcox was brought in as technical director to oversee the on-pitch strategy and ensure the same philosophy ran throughout the club. He will be eager to see that Amorim is clear with his thinking and can quickly demonstrate it after Ten Hag\u2019s United worked as individuals rather than a collective when pressing. The new head coach will have his own ideas but entering mid-season could make it difficult to implement them quickly, particularly with United playing twice a week for the foreseeable future, so this will be a great test of Amorim\u2019s competence.</p> \n<h2><strong>Improve squad\u2019s injury record</strong></h2> \n<p>There is a question of whether Ten Hag suffered from misfortune or whether his intense methods caused the problems that resulted in swathes of injuries. Last season United sustained 66 injuries, more than any other Premier League team and a startling figure that left them spending a long time without a recognised left-back. The medical department has been revamped but little has changed. Leny Yoro, Maguire, Luke Shaw, Tyrell Malacia, Mainoo, Mount, Toby Collyer and Antony were absent for the final match of the Ten Hag epoch. No team or manager could reach an optimum level when consistently having to tinker with their starting XI because of the conveyor belt of absentees but it cannot all be bad luck and a solution must be found.</p>",

He will be eager to see that Amorim is clear with his thinking and can quickly demonstrate it after Ten Hag\u2019s United worked as individuals rather than a collective when pressing. The new head coach will have his own ideas but entering mid-season could make it difficult to implement them quickly, particularly with United playing twice a week for the foreseeable future, so this will be a great test of Amorim\u2019s competence. Improve squad\u2019s injury record There is a question of whether Ten Hag suffered from misfortune or whether his intense methods caused the problems that resulted in swathes of injuries. Last season United sustained 66 injuries, more than any other Premier League team and a startling figure that left them spending a long time without a recognised left-back. The medical department has been revamped but little has changed. Leny Yoro, Maguire, Luke Shaw, Tyrell Malacia, Mainoo, Mount, Toby Collyer and Antony were absent for the final match of the Ten Hag epoch. No team or manager could reach an optimum level when consistently having to tinker with their starting XI because of the conveyor belt of absentees but it cannot all be bad luck and a solution must be found.",

An adoptee from China who was raised in a conservative Christian family, she believed she owed a debt to the United States. But the Hamas attacks in Israel last year, and Israel\u2019s war that followed, rocked Metzler\u2019s convictions. Within months, she filed for conscientious objector status, one of a small number of US military personnel seeking to end their service because of their moral opposition to US support for Israel. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Palestine was a place before October 7,\u201d Metzler told the Guardian. \u201cAll of a sudden it felt like a light clicking on for me.\u201d As the war in Gaza enters a second year, some disillusioned members of the US military have turned to the Vietnam war-era conscientious objector policy to terminate their military service because of religious or moral convictions.

      "body": "<p>Three days before the National League South side Worthing face Morecambe of League Two in the first round of the FA Cup, builders are putting the finishing touches to the main entrance of the club\u2019s Woodside Road stadium. Nestled in a suburban neighbourhood of the west Sussex seaside town, the Rebels have enjoyed a rapid rise up the non-league pyramid and on Saturday will officially open their new North Stand that takes the capacity to 4,000.</p> <p>For the owner, George Dowell, who was paralysed from the chest down in a car crash when he was 17, days after being named on the bench for Worthing\u2019s first team, it will be a particularly proud moment. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be amazing to see it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to get that \u2018North Stand, give us a wave\u2019 chant so the atmosphere is going all around the ground these days.\u201d</p> <p>There has been some transformation from the era when barely 200 spectators would attend matches. In 2015, at the age of 22, Dowell became one of the youngest owners in English football when he used some of the compensation money he received from his accident to buy his local club and he has overseen two promotions. A documentary, <a href=\"https://www.tntsports.co.uk/football/club-that-george-built-worthing-fc_sto20039662/story.shtml\">The club that George built</a>, that was made available for streaming on Discovery Plus and TNT Sports at the start of October and followed Worthing last season as they came within a whisker of being promoted to the fifth tier for the first time, has helped raise the profile of the club. Attendances are averaging about 1,500.</p> <p>\u201cA lot more people know about the club these days,\u201d Dowell says. \u201cHopefully if we keep playing well then people will want to keep coming back.\u201d</p> <p>Dowell could never have imagined this would have been possible when he was in hospital for three months after the accident. Unable to move and coming to the realisation that he would never play football again, there appeared to be no light at the end of the tunnel. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone with a disability so it was really hard to gauge what this means in terms of what I can and can\u2019t do,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t really hold out much hope at the time.\u201d</p>    <p>The turning point came when he was recovering at Salisbury district hospital\u2019s spinal treatment centre and a former tree surgeon who had also been paralysed visited some of the patients.</p> <p>\u201cThey would come and share their lived experiences,\u201d Dowell says. \u201cI remember this one guy and he had a really cool car and that was something I thought I would never be able to have. When I saw that, it made me think: \u2018I can do that.\u2019 It gave me hope to see that he was out doing his own thing and enjoying his life. So I thought: \u2018OK, there is plenty you can still go out and achieve.\u2019 You need something to cling on to, to give you an image of what life can be like.\u201d</p> <p>Football not only provided him with hope but eventually a career. Dowell spent 10 months in hospital in total and one of the first new skills he learned there was how to play Football Manager on his computer. He spent hours playing as Manchester United or teams from National League South because Worthing were not included given their lowly status at the time. \u201cIt was a very proud moment when we were promoted and we were officially on the game,\u201d he says, though Dowell admits he has yet to take control on Football Manager of the club he now owns: \u201cIt takes so much time \u2013 you have to really commit to it. But back then it was my release from everything.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Getting to the Football League is the long-term ambition ... there\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t sustain it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dowell remembers finding the transition to being in a wheelchair very difficult. \u201cI would really struggle going out or going to new places because I was worried that it wouldn\u2019t be accessible and there would be a big fuss when I got there,\u201d he says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t very comfortable in my own skin so I ended up staying at home a lot.\u201d</p> <p>That changed when he and a group of former teammates formed their own club \u2013 Worthing Borough \u2013 in the lowest level of the West Sussex league, with Dowell as the manager. It was a decision that changed his life. \u201cIt really helped because it forced me to get back out of the house. When you\u2019re going to these matches with 16 of your mates it just made me feel less worried about the fact that it might not be accessible because they will get me in there anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Dowell achieved successive promotions but was unable to find training facilities and came up with a plan to build a community football hub in the town when he read in the local newspaper about Worthing\u2019s financial struggles. \u201cI always had in my mind that I wanted to make a career for myself and not just sit at home going crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cSo when this opportunity came up I had the money set aside and it was like: \u2018Wow, I can build a career and save my local club at the same time.\u2019\u201d</p>    <p>Worthing haven\u2019t looked back and have finished fourth and third since being promoted to National League South in 2022 \u2013 their highest league placings. Their success has come despite having what Dowell, who was awarded an MBE last year, describes as a \u201cmid-table\u201d budget. Their 3G pitch is rented out to local clubs to cover some of the running costs.</p> <p>\u201cThere is this myth that I spend all my money on the club,\u201d Dowell says. \u201cFor the first two or three years, I had to put money in but just like with any business when you\u2019re starting, you have to invest. Now it\u2019s fully sustainable and that is down to the good work of the board.\u201d</p> <p>Dowell prides himself on the pathway Worthing have created to the first team after he introduced youth teams at various age groups. Brad Dolaghan joined West Ham in the summer after scoring six goals in five games during their run to the playoff final last season, the latest in a long line of youth team graduates to have made it to the first team. \u201cIf you have young local lads coming through the team then everyone is so much more patient with them,\u201d says Dowell. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve had so many players who have moved up the pyramid it really helps with the next batch of recruitment because they see what is possible.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cGetting to the Football League is the long-term ambition. There\u2019s not that many pro clubs around us so the catchment area is pretty big and Worthing has a bigger population than people think. So there\u2019s no reason why we couldn\u2019t sustain it.\u201d</p> <p>Worthing have made a solid start under their new manager, Chris Agutter, and Dowell is relishing the opportunity to reach the second round of the FA Cup for only the second time in the club\u2019s history having missed last year\u2019s defeat by Alfreton at this stage to attend the birth of his daughter, Bonnie.</p> <p>\u201cI watched it on a live stream in the hospital so it will be good to be there this time,\u201d he says. \u201cMorecambe are on a really bad run so it\u2019s winnable. One thing we haven\u2019t really managed to do since I came here is put in a really strong Cup run together so it would be amazing if we can get through. Like the documentary, it would bring a whole new set of eyes to the club.\u201d</p>",

Brad Dolaghan joined West Ham in the summer after scoring six goals in five games during their run to the playoff final last season, the latest in a long line of youth team graduates to have made it to the first team. \u201cIf you have young local lads coming through the team then everyone is so much more patient with them,\u201d says Dowell. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve had so many players who have moved up the pyramid it really helps with the next batch of recruitment because they see what is possible.\u201d He adds: \u201cGetting to the Football League is the long-term ambition. There\u2019s not that many pro clubs around us so the catchment area is pretty big and Worthing has a bigger population than people think. So there\u2019s no reason why we couldn\u2019t sustain it.\u201d Worthing have made a solid start under their new manager, Chris Agutter, and Dowell is relishing the opportunity to reach the second round of the FA Cup for only the second time in the club\u2019s history having missed last year\u2019s defeat by Alfreton at this stage to attend the birth of his daughter, Bonnie. \u201cI watched it on a live stream in the hospital so it will be good to be there this time,\u201d he says. \u201cMorecambe are on a really bad run so it\u2019s winnable. One thing we haven\u2019t really managed to do since I came here is put in a really strong Cup run together so it would be amazing if we can get through. Like the documentary, it would bring a whole new set of eyes to the club.\u201d",

These delights are \u00a34.50 each, but then, this is Belgravia, where even breathing is expensive. Wildflowers, like most things in the area, is so charming and tasteful that finding fault is a challenge: you sit in a room of marble, velvet, oak and terracotta, eating complimentary warm focaccia while waiting for a generous plate of prosciutto San Daniele served with feisty pickled peaches.

      "body": "<p>A little-known tragedy from the second world war is the subject of a documentary that has been a surprise hit in China and is the country\u2019s pick for two Academy Awards \u2013 although it has already been disqualified from one of the categories.</p> <p>On Monday, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/china-oscars-entry-sinking-lisbon-maru-not-eligible-1236046834/\">it was revealed</a> that The Sinking of the Lisbon Maru, which had been selected by China as its entry for the best international feature prize at the Oscars, had been deemed ineligible. The competition\u2019s rules state that a film in that category must have \u201ca predominantly (more than 50%) non-English dialogue track\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know the rules at all,\u201d explains Fang Li, the director, who says it was selected by China\u2019s official committee without his knowledge. Fang says that the definition of \u201cdialogue\u201d was unclear, and that by some definitions his film, which interviews people in China, the UK and Japan, could still be considered to be 50% non-English.</p>    <p>The Sinking of the Lisbon Maru tells the story of a Japanese ship that was used to transport 1,816 British prisoners of war from Hong Kong to Japan during the second world war. In October 1942, as the unmarked vessel was sailing through the East China Sea, it was torpedoed by the US navy. Hundreds of prisoners drowned or were shot by Japanese troops as they tried to escape. But more than 300 were rescued by Chinese fishers who spotted the smoke and debris from an archipelago on China\u2019s east coast (most were later recaptured by the Japanese).</p> <p>Fang, a businessman turned film director, first learned about the incident when he overheard a fisher on Dongji island, part of the Zhoushan archipelago that more than 80 years ago was the site of the rescue mission, mention the existence of a sunken ship from the second world war in the nearby waters. Fang set out to find the ship\u2019s remains, but soon the project became about telling the stories of the people on board. \u201cI wanted all those 828 men to not be forgotten,\u201d says Fang, the film\u2019s director, producer, and host, referring to the men who didn\u2019t survive.</p> <p>With many of the people involved in the incident since deceased, piecing together the story was a struggle. At one point, Fang enlisted the help of a private detective in Tokyo to track down the children of Kyoda Shigeru, the captain of the Lisbon Maru, who in 1947 was convicted of war crimes for his role in the incident. PoWs had been forced into the ship\u2019s hold when the vessel was sinking, causing many to die by suffocation as well as drowning. His children, now elderly themselves, say that their father never mentioned the incident. \u201cMaybe at the thought of so many deaths, he was full of remorse,\u201d says Shigeru\u2019s son.</p>    <p>To find the British survivors, Fang took a different approach. In 2018, he placed full-page <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-44814053\">advertisements</a> in British newspapers <strong>-</strong> including the Guardian and the Observer \u2013 calling out for any surviving PoWs or their relatives to get in touch. Fang says he received more than 380 responses.</p> <p>Although the film features \u201cshocking Japanese violence\u201d, the film is about \u201ctouching family stories\u201d, Fang says. But nearly 80 years after the war, the countries involved in the Lisbon Maru tragedy \u2013 the US, the UK, China and Japan \u2013 still do not all have easy relationships. In recent months, there has been a spate of anti-Japanese nationalism in China, including two separate stabbing incidents. In one of the attacks, a 10-year-old Japanese boy in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy94qq01qweo\">fatally stabbed</a> on the anniversary of Japan\u2019s invasion of China in 1931 (China\u2019s foreign minister <a href=\"https://www.mfa.gov.cn/web/wjbz_673089/xghd_673097/202409/t20240924_11495357.shtml\">told Japan</a> to \u201cavoid politicising or exaggerating the issue\u201d).</p> <p>Asked whether he worries that the documentary, which has a 9.3/10 rating on <a href=\"https://movie.douban.com/subject/30412658/\">Douban</a>, a Chinese review website, will contribute to anti-Japanese sentiment, Fang says he hopes not. \u201cThis is not the purpose or the value of the film. The value of the film is the human stories,\u201d he says. He wants to \u201cfill in the blanks\u201d of history.</p>    <p>Still, the film, which is looking for a UK distributor, has been received enthusiastically by the Chinese authorities. Despite being disqualified from the best international feature film category at the Oscars, it is still China\u2019s pick for the best documentary feature.</p> <p>In 2022, Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, wrote a letter to the daughter of Dennis Morley, one of the last surviving POWs from the Lisbon Maru.

      "body": "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>Life skills you never knew you had. A little while ago I met a friend for lunch in a central London restaurant. It was all about as normal as any meal out can be. After ordering our food we proceeded to catch up on each other\u2019s weeks. How the government was doing, what friends were up to and what we had been reading and watching on TV.</p> <p>Then while we were eating, I noticed my friend appeared to be coughing. I stopped what I was saying to give him time to recover. Only he didn\u2019t and it rapidly became apparent that he was struggling for breath. His face had changed colour and he was starting to dribble from his mouth. At which point, I realised that he was choking. I looked around the restaurant hoping that someone else had noticed. Hoping there might be a doctor present. No one \u2013 not even the staff \u2013 showed any interest.</p> <p>I could feel myself start to panic. I had no life-saving training at all. But if I did nothing, my friend might die. It felt surreal. Dream like. Then my own body went into autopilot. I found myself telling my friend I was going to give him the Heimlich manoeuvre. Even though all I knew about it had come from reading about other people performing it. I was winging it. Hoping for the best, I picked him up from his chair, stood beside him and let my hands search for the soft spot just below the rib cage. And gave a firm squeeze. I didn\u2019t detect a piece of chicken fly out of his mouth, but moments later his chest heaved and he started breathing more normally again.</p> <p>I have no idea if my actions made a difference and whether he would have cleared his airway anyway. Weirdly, everyone in the restaurant just continued eating. My friend and I just sat down and resumed our meal, embarrassed to have caused a scene. If it was a near-death experience, it had been a very British one.</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>Never say never and all that. Given the rate of churn within the current Tory party you can never entirely rule out a return, but for now at least the political careers of two senior Conservative MPs appear to be at end. First to go this week \u2013 not with a bang but with a whimper \u2013 was Jeremy Hunt.</p> <p>On a human level, I always had a soft spot for Jezza as he always appeared to be so transparently out of his depth. Not waving but drowning. He was only appointed chancellor after Kwasi Kwarteng crashed and burned the economy because he looked like the only plausible option. A man with no financial brain but who somehow looked right in the job. He made his last speaking appearance in the Commons during Treasury questions. You couldn\u2019t miss the pathos. He was desperate to mark the occasion with a dignified exit. Rachel Reeves merely reminded him that he was the man responsible for the \u00a322bn hole in the country\u2019s finances. I had seldom seen Jezza looking so crushed.</p> <p>Next to go the following day was Rishi Sunak. His was more of a spirited exit. One to remind the Tories of what they were missing. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2024/oct/30/keir-starmer-pays-tribute-rishi-sunak-final-pmqs-video\">some rather tender exchanges</a> with Keir Starmer at prime minister\u2019s questions \u2013 a reminder that politicians can be quite nice to one another when they want to be \u2013 he went on the attack in his reply to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/30/reeves-offered-few-laughs-and-no-great-surprises-in-her-budget-speech-but-austerity-it-wasnt\">Reeves\u2019s budget speech</a>. More a rant. Mostly sound and fury signifying nothing. He wasn\u2019t helped by having Hunt sit next to him. Throughout the budget, Jezza had said almost nothing to help Rishi but now he passed him a note saying the Office for Budget Responsibility had let him off the hook over the financial black hole. It hadn\u2019t. But so sweet of Jezza to remain on brand to the end. His final act to get something wrong again.</p>    <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>Just how much TV can anyone be expected to watch? I ask because I can\u2019t really get to grips with the economics of the TV networks and streaming services. More and more providers churning out more and more expensive content that could only possibly be watched if every household had countless TV\u2019s all tuned to different networks and stations. I like to think I put the TV hours in, but clearly I am an amateur. Many friends whose judgment I respect have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/18/rivals-review-even-the-naked-tennis-scene-is-a-triumph\">raved about Rivals</a>. I don\u2019t have the energy and can\u2019t bear the thought of stumping up for yet another monthly subscription. I\u2019m far too disorganised to remember to unsubscribe after a free month\u2019s trial and a quick glance at the content tells me there\u2019s nothing else on Disney+ that I would want to watch.</p> <p>Same goes for Paramount+. Nothing there for me. I began with just three subscriptions \u2013 to Sky, Amazon Prime and Netflix \u2013 but a year ago I reluctantly signed up to Apple TV because I wanted to watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/sep/11/ive-only-just-hitched-my-wagon-to-slow-horses-but-im-loving-the-ride\">Slow Horses</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/jan/24/masters-of-the-air-review-spielberg-and-hankss-band-of-brothers-follow-up-is-absolutely-classic-tv\">Masters of the Air</a>. But since racing through those series \u2013 both brilliant \u2013 it\u2019s been a law of diminishing returns. </p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>A new survey has revealed that nearly one in 10 people working from home have taken to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/28/the-naughty-siesta-why-workers-are-secretly-napping-at-home\">having the odd nap in the afternoon</a>. To which the only observation is: that few? I suspect that not all the respondents were entirely honest. I\u2019ve certainly had the odd nap on company time. There again, I\u2019ve frequently worked far later and for far longer than a notional 40-hour week so I like to think my bosses are getting value for money.</p> <p>In any case, a 20-minute power nap \u2013 or sleep as some of us call it \u2013 can often be beneficial. Far better to have a brief snooze and wake up refreshed than to struggle through an entire afternoon trying to keep yourself awake with endless cups of tea. Years back, when I was a freelancer, I\u2019d often have an afternoon doze and when I started working from home during lockdown I found myself reverting to old habits. Often when I woke up I\u2019d find I had thought a way through a political sketch with which I had been struggling. Win win. I mean, we\u2019re not talking of going to bed and taking the entire afternoon off here.</p> <p>Rather than costing companies billions of pounds a year in sleep, surely there has to be some sort of cost benefit \u2013 in staff morale and mental and physical health. Besides if companies are looking to make efficiency savings, they would be better off cutting back on the number of pointless meetings they have. Sometimes there are meetings to discuss meetings. If you want something done, then ask someone who is having a snooze.</p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>Even the Tory party hasn\u2019t taken much interest in the Conservative leadership race. Early reports suggest that turnout in the ballot of members has been low. Neither candidate has exactly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/17/kemikaze-and-honest-bob-are-let-loose-on-gb-news-where-they-cant-do-any-harm\">gone out of their way to win hearts and minds</a>. Honest Bob has been on quite the journey. Ten years ago he was a wetter than wet Remainer Cameroon. Now he\u2019s a dog-whistle rightwinger who wouldn\u2019t be out of place in Reform. He has even threatened to expel any MP from the party who doesn\u2019t support leaving the European convention on human rights. Bob, do the maths. There\u2019s only 121 Tory MPs. Kick out the moderates and the Lib Dems will become the official opposition. Then there\u2019s KemiKaze, the ultimate populist. At least there\u2019s something authentic about her, but she is delusional. She\u2019s spent much of the past week denying saying a whole lot of stuff about Jenrick\u2019s impropriety, maternity pay and the civil service for which there are recordings.</p> <p>Whoever is named the winner shortly after 11am on Saturday, you can\u2019t help feeling they will be gone within a couple of years and the Conservatives will have to repeat the process. The Labour party may have had a tough week with the budget, but at least it doesn\u2019t have to worry about the Tories.</p>    <ul> <li><p><em>Taking the Lead by John Crace is published by Little, Brown (\u00a318.99).

A man with no financial brain but who somehow looked right in the job. He made his last speaking appearance in the Commons during Treasury questions. You couldn\u2019t miss the pathos. He was desperate to mark the occasion with a dignified exit. Rachel Reeves merely reminded him that he was the man responsible for the \u00a322bn hole in the country\u2019s finances. I had seldom seen Jezza looking so crushed. Next to go the following day was Rishi Sunak. His was more of a spirited exit. One to remind the Tories of what they were missing. After some rather tender exchanges with Keir Starmer at prime minister\u2019s questions \u2013 a reminder that politicians can be quite nice to one another when they want to be \u2013 he went on the attack in his reply to Reeves\u2019s budget speech. More a rant. Mostly sound and fury signifying nothing. He wasn\u2019t helped by having Hunt sit next to him. Throughout the budget, Jezza had said almost nothing to help Rishi but now he passed him a note saying the Office for Budget Responsibility had let him off the hook over the financial black hole. It hadn\u2019t. But so sweet of Jezza to remain on brand to the end. His final act to get something wrong again. Wednesday Just how much TV can anyone be expected to watch? I ask because I can\u2019t really get to grips with the economics of the TV networks and streaming services. More and more providers churning out more and more expensive content that could only possibly be watched if every household had countless TV\u2019s all tuned to different networks and stations. I like to think I put the TV hours in, but clearly I am an amateur. Many friends whose judgment I respect have raved about Rivals. I don\u2019t have the energy and can\u2019t bear the thought of stumping up for yet another monthly subscription. I\u2019m far too disorganised to remember to unsubscribe after a free month\u2019s trial and a quick glance at the content tells me there\u2019s nothing else on Disney+ that I would want to watch. Same goes for Paramount+. Nothing there for me. I began with just three subscriptions \u2013 to Sky, Amazon Prime and Netflix \u2013 but a year ago I reluctantly signed up to Apple TV because I wanted to watch Slow Horses and Masters of the Air. But since racing through those series \u2013 both brilliant \u2013 it\u2019s been a law of diminishing returns. Thursday A new survey has revealed that nearly one in 10 people working from home have taken to having the odd nap in the afternoon. To which the only observation is: that few? I suspect that not all the respondents were entirely honest. I\u2019ve certainly had the odd nap on company time. There again, I\u2019ve frequently worked far later and for far longer than a notional 40-hour week so I like to think my bosses are getting value for money. In any case, a 20-minute power nap \u2013 or sleep as some of us call it \u2013 can often be beneficial. Far better to have a brief snooze and wake up refreshed than to struggle through an entire afternoon trying to keep yourself awake with endless cups of tea. Years back, when I was a freelancer, I\u2019d often have an afternoon doze and when I started working from home during lockdown I found myself reverting to old habits. Often when I woke up I\u2019d find I had thought a way through a political sketch with which I had been struggling. Win win. I mean, we\u2019re not talking of going to bed and taking the entire afternoon off here. Rather than costing companies billions of pounds a year in sleep, surely there has to be some sort of cost benefit \u2013 in staff morale and mental and physical health. Besides if companies are looking to make efficiency savings, they would be better off cutting back on the number of pointless meetings they have. Sometimes there are meetings to discuss meetings. If you want something done, then ask someone who is having a snooze. Friday Even the Tory party hasn\u2019t taken much interest in the Conservative leadership race. Early reports suggest that turnout in the ballot of members has been low. Neither candidate has exactly gone out of their way to win hearts and minds. Honest Bob has been on quite the journey. Ten years ago he was a wetter than wet Remainer Cameroon. Now he\u2019s a dog-whistle rightwinger who wouldn\u2019t be out of place in Reform. He has even threatened to expel any MP from the party who doesn\u2019t support leaving the European convention on human rights. Bob, do the maths. There\u2019s only 121 Tory MPs. Kick out the moderates and the Lib Dems will become the official opposition. Then there\u2019s KemiKaze, the ultimate populist. At least there\u2019s something authentic about her, but she is delusional. She\u2019s spent much of the past week denying saying a whole lot of stuff about Jenrick\u2019s impropriety, maternity pay and the civil service for which there are recordings. Whoever is named the winner shortly after 11am on Saturday, you can\u2019t help feeling they will be gone within a couple of years and the Conservatives will have to repeat the process. The Labour party may have had a tough week with the budget, but at least it doesn\u2019t have to worry about the Tories. Taking the Lead by John Crace is published by Little, Brown (\u00a318.99).

      "bodyText": "Good morning. As the 2024 presidential race nears its climax on Tuesday, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump continue to rush around swing states, rallying voters in the hopes of being sworn into the world\u2019s most powerful office on 20 January 2025. On Thursday both candidates held rallies in the swing state of Nevada. Harris\u2019s rally had a joyful mood, with mothers carrying infants, supporters wearing Halloween costumes and an appearance by Jennifer Lopez. \u201cWe\u2019re not going back!\u201d people chanted. At Trump\u2019s event supporters cheered the demonization of immigrants, jeered the \u201cfake news\u201d media and broke into chants of \u201cFight! Fight! Fight!\u201d Meanwhile, Trump told Tucker Carlson in an interview that Elon Musk and Robert F Kennedy Jr could be \u201cinfluential figures\u201d if he wins. What are the polls showing? It\u2019s unclear. Nationally, Harris is at 47% and Trump 46%, but due to the electoral college system, it\u2019s going to come down to a few swing states. It\u2019s neck and neck. How many have already voted? More than 65 million people have cast their ballots, as of 31 October at 11pm EST. How do you spend a billion dollars in election funding? Check out Richard Luscombe\u2019s piece on where the money actually goes. About 8,000 North Korean soldiers at Ukraine border, says US About 8,000 North Korean soldiers are stationed in Russia on the border with Ukraine, the US secretary of state has said, warning that Moscow is preparing to deploy those troops into combat \u201cin the coming days\u201d. Antony Blinken said the US believed that North Korea had sent 10,000 troops to Russia in total, deploying them first to training bases in the far east before sending the vast majority to the Kursk region on the border with Ukraine. The deployment could expand the largest land war in Europe since the second world war into a multi-region conflict, tying in the rising tensions in the Korean peninsula between North and South Korea. Here\u2019s what the US envoy to the UN said: Robert Wood bluntly warned that Pyongyang\u2019s forces entering Ukraine \u201cwill surely return in body bags\u201d. Ukraine is bracing for the outcome of the US presidential election: in an interview with the Guardian in May, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had \u201cno strategy yet\u201d for what to do if Trump returned to the White House, though he suggested the outline of a plan rooted in an appeal to the candidate\u2019s vanity. Israel\u2019s expanded strikes suggest \u2018rejection\u2019 of ceasefire, says Lebanon\u2019s prime minister Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, Najib Mikati, criticised Israel\u2019s \u201cexpansion\u201d of its attacks on the country, saying they indicated a rejection of efforts to broker a truce after more than a month of war, Agence France-Presse reports. \u201cThe Israeli enemy\u2019s renewed expansion of the scope of its aggression on Lebanese regions, its repeated threats to the population to evacuate entire cities and villages, and its renewed targeting of the southern suburbs of Beirut with destructive raids, are all indicators that confirm the Israeli enemy\u2019s rejection of all efforts being made to secure a ceasefire,\u201d Mikati said in a statement after overnight raids hit Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, in the first such attack this week. Reuters reports a US envoy this week asked Lebanon to declare a unilateral ceasefire with Israel as part of an effort to help negotiations reach a resolution for the more than year-long conflict, a senior Lebanese political source and a senior diplomat told the agency. How many people in Lebanon have been killed in the conflict? The country\u2019s health ministry says more than 2,800 people have been killed and 13,000 wounded since 8 October 2023. In other news \u2026 Striking Boeing workers will vote on an improved contract offer on Monday, which includes a 38% pay rise over four years and a larger signing bonus. Not a single country has contributed towards reparations for the victims and survivors of the Ugandan warlord Dominic Ongwen, despite the international criminal court awarding \u20ac52.4m in February. Cutting children\u2019s sugar can protect them against adult diabetes and high blood pressure, with research suggesting a 35% drop in type 2 diabetes and a 20% fall in high blood pressure. Stat of the day: $700 San Francisco \u2018pod\u2019 with privacy curtains and charging ports A company that rents \u201csleeping pods\u201d in downtown San Francisco for $700 a month has had 300 people apply for its remaining 17 beds, the company\u2019s CEO said.

Its rhythm is infinitely more involving than IDK\u2019s pungent \u2013 and presumably well-researched \u2013 thoughts on \u201ctitties and ass\u201d. Water-treading single Tiffany is little better, with Gunna\u2019s usual mellifluous hogwash floating amiably in the wake of IDK\u2019s perfunctory lead verse. He even has the gall to huff \u201cif she ain\u2019t got the brains, she can\u2019t be a 10\u201d. Frankly, she could say the same about him.",

For years I\u2019ve contemplated planting autumn and winter-flowering clematis, and writing about them for you is probably the best accountability I could achieve.</p> <p>Clematis plants are proper doers in the garden: they scramble and climb and bloom, demanding little more than a savage haircut every few years and a carefully considered planting spot. You can find a clematis blooming in every month of the year, and I know of gardeners who have filled their garden with dozens of them to make the most of that fact. We inherited an established <em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/96540/clematis-montana-var-rubens-pink-perfection-(m)/details\">C.

When I did finally prune it to the ground, because it was blooming more on the neighbour\u2019s fence than ours and they gave it an unsympathetic haircut, it returned like a particularly dutiful golden retriever. I\u2019m enormously fond of it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Clematis demand little more than\u00a0a savage haircut every few years and a\u00a0carefully considered planting spot</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Montana blooms in spring and sometimes gives a second flush in September, but there are varieties that add sparkle to greyer days. Start with <em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/3930/clematis-cirrhosa/details\">Clematis </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/3930/clematis-cirrhosa/details\">cirrhosa</a></em>, which is evergreen. Its dark green foliage acts as a backdrop to showier summer flowers, then it puts on its own show from November onwards. <em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/89092/clematis-cirrhosa-var-purpurascens-freckles-(c)/details\">C. cirrhosa </a></em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/89092/clematis-cirrhosa-var-purpurascens-freckles-(c)/details\">\u2018Freckles\u2019</a> is deep pink with suitably freckle-like markings; \u2018<a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/95824/clematis-cirrhosa-wisley-cream-(c)/details\">Wisley Cream</a>\u2019 is an immaculate off-white and \u2018<a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/296339/clematis-cirrhosa-jingle-bells-(c)/details\">Jingle Bells</a>\u2019 has large, pale cream flowers on pink stems. <em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/211176/clematis-urophylla-winter-beauty/details\">Clematis urophylla</a></em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/211176/clematis-urophylla-winter-beauty/details\"> \u2018Winter Beauty\u2019</a> is the one I\u2019ve been thinking of; with bell-like white flowers and flared petals, it is also evergreen and scented, giving you reason to get into the garden on the darkest days. <em><a href=\"https://www.habitataid.co.uk/products/old-mans-beard-clematis-vitalba\">Clematis vitalba</a></em>, meanwhile, you may know as Old Man\u2019s Beard \u2013 it comes into its own as its flowers transform into fluffy tendrils in the colder months, perfect for catching frost or bringing inside as part of an arrangement.</p> <p>Clematis may grow fast and well, once established, but only in the right place: some prefer their roots to be in the shade, even if they are sun-lovers. Check the label and, if in doubt, ask the nursery who sold it to you. They are pot-friendly, but get the biggest container you can find. Finally, make sure it has something to grow up: a wall, fence, doorway or porch. Trellises can be easily outgrown; I prefer to string up wire with turnbuckle hooks, which are adjustable, unobtrusive and cheap.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There might be fireworks in the skies this week, but unless your past self was very clever and planted all manner of jaunty things for autumn earlier in the year (I\u2019m thinking of Cuphea cyanea, salvia, a Nerine or three, or some Hylotelephiums), chances are your garden is winding down. In previous years I\u2019ve succumbed to trays of pansies to cheer up tubs in November and December, but I\u2019m moving away from short-lived plug plants \u2013 all that plastic, greenhouse heat and transport miles \u2013 and looking towards perennial solutions. For years I\u2019ve contemplated planting autumn and winter-flowering clematis, and writing about them for you is probably the best accountability I could achieve. Clematis plants are proper doers in the garden: they scramble and climb and bloom, demanding little more than a savage haircut every few years and a carefully considered planting spot. You can find a clematis blooming in every month of the year, and I know of gardeners who have filled their garden with dozens of them to make the most of that fact. We inherited an established C. Montana \u2018Pink Perfection\u2019 with the garden and it grew on me like it did our fence: vigorously. When I did finally prune it to the ground, because it was blooming more on the neighbour\u2019s fence than ours and they gave it an unsympathetic haircut, it returned like a particularly dutiful golden retriever. I\u2019m enormously fond of it. Montana blooms in spring and sometimes gives a second flush in September, but there are varieties that add sparkle to greyer days. Start with Clematis cirrhosa, which is evergreen. Its dark green foliage acts as a backdrop to showier summer flowers, then it puts on its own show from November onwards. C. cirrhosa \u2018Freckles\u2019 is deep pink with suitably freckle-like markings; \u2018Wisley Cream\u2019 is an immaculate off-white and \u2018Jingle Bells\u2019 has large, pale cream flowers on pink stems. Clematis urophylla \u2018Winter Beauty\u2019 is the one I\u2019ve been thinking of; with bell-like white flowers and flared petals, it is also evergreen and scented, giving you reason to get into the garden on the darkest days. Clematis vitalba, meanwhile, you may know as Old Man\u2019s Beard \u2013 it comes into its own as its flowers transform into fluffy tendrils in the colder months, perfect for catching frost or bringing inside as part of an arrangement. Clematis may grow fast and well, once established, but only in the right place: some prefer their roots to be in the shade, even if they are sun-lovers. Check the label and, if in doubt, ask the nursery who sold it to you. They are pot-friendly, but get the biggest container you can find. Finally, make sure it has something to grow up: a wall, fence, doorway or porch. Trellises can be easily outgrown; I prefer to string up wire with turnbuckle hooks, which are adjustable, unobtrusive and cheap.",

      "bodyText": "Four years ago, the nail-biter US presidential election was decided only by tens of thousands of votes in just a trio of states. Now, as the blistering 2024 campaign enters its final stretch, party organizers are hoping for a new source of votes that could determine who wins the keys to White House: Canada. With polls showing the vice-president, Kamala Harris, locked in a dead heat with the former president Donald Trump, both sides are courting as many as 700,000 eligible voters to the north. \u201cIn 2020, Joe Biden won the presidency by 45,000 votes out of more than 160 million people voting. Only 45,000 votes in three battleground states, Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin, determined the margin of victory. These numbers are very, very small,\u201d said Bruce Heyman, the former US ambassador to Canada. \u201cWhen you start looking at pools of votes who could have an impact on this election, and every indication is that both the election and battleground are virtually tied, small numbers of votes can be the determining factor. The country with the largest voting potential is Canada,\u201d he said. America\u2019s use of the electoral college, which allocates presidential votes in such a way that certain states hold immense and consequential political weight, is the focus of both Democratic and Republican campaigners looking to gain an edge in the races that could be decided on the slimmest of margins. Of the estimated 2.3m million eligible US voters abroad, roughly 700,000 live in Canada. And in an election that will come down to a handful of votes in a few key states, organizers are targeting any voter they can find. Three key states, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, are close to Canada and have a higher proportion of residents living across the border than other swing states. Heyman, an Illinois native, has been working with a cadre of volunteers working to secure a Harris victory. They have increased their efforts in the last three months, canvassing in border cities such as Windsor, Ontario, erecting billboards, visiting university campuses and \u201cdoing everything we can\u201d to register as many people as possible. \u201cThis is going to be really close,\u201d said Heyman. \u201cBut you never really know if those efforts have paid off until you hit the end. You never know what works. You have to use different strategies for Americans living abroad \u2013 and it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a registry to consult to find your voters. You really don\u2019t know where they are.\u201d Voting intent for Americans abroad often differs from those at home, where \u201clocal issues drive local votes\u201d, Heyman said. Among former president Donald Trump\u2019s campaign promises \u2013 including ending support for Ukraine in its war effort and carrying out the largest domestic deportation operation in US history \u2013 is a fear he will return the US to an era of protectionism which would have immense impacts for its trading partners, the largest of which is Canada. When negotiating a new North American free trade agreement, Trump previously said his team was \u201cvery unhappy\u201d with the content and \u201cnegotiating style\u201d of Canada\u2019s trade envoy. Canada has its own protectionist policies that support its dairy farmers by imposing heavy taxes on cheese and milk imports, and they would probably serve as a fresh target for a second Trump administration. \u201cI admittedly didn\u2019t think much about how our elections at home would affect places like Canada,\u201d said Austin Pettigrew, who moved to Toronto in 2021. \u201cBut now everyone is talking about the election here.

The <a href=\"https://www.swedishtouristassociation.com/facilities/stf-abisko-turiststation/\">STF Abisko Turiststation</a> served as our base for every snow-related activity that you can imagine: I tried snowshoeing, husky sled driving and cross-country skiing. Equally enjoyable was warming up by one of the many fireplaces and gazing out at the beautiful frozen lake. And, due to the location where a climate phenomenon results in some of the clearest skies in Europe, it was also a wonderful place to watch the northern lights. Scandinavia is famously expensive but staying in the clean, comfortable dorm and cooking in the well-equipped kitchen helped with the costs.<br><strong>Pippa</strong></p> <h2><strong>A budget ski break in Andorra</strong></h2>    <p>Last year, due to rising costs and a smaller budget, we decided to forgo the Alps for our annual week of skiing and hit the slopes of the Pyrenees in Andorra instead. We stayed in <a href=\"https://www.pasdelacasa.com/\">El Pas de la Casa</a>, a lively ski resort with access to the wider <a href=\"https://www.grandvalira.com/en\">Grandvalira</a> ski area. The town was more concrete than chocolate-box, but the mountains were just as pretty, and we had more than 210km (130 miles) of runs to explore with modern lifts and minimal queues. The best part? The holiday cost almost half as much as the Alps.<br><strong>Elliot Armstrong</strong></p> <h2><strong>Hot springs of the</strong> <strong>Cerdagne valley</strong></h2>    <p>North-west of Perpignan is the Cerdagne valley and Capcir, where you can find open-air <a href=\"https://www.pyrenees-cerdagne.com/planifier/activites/activites-et-loisirs/bains-de-dorres-731038\">hot spring baths</a> from \u20ac6 per person. These are just a 20-minute drive from the various ski slopes, so you can work those quads in the morning, and then relax in the very healing warm waters in the afternoon. <a href=\"https://www.pyrenees-cerdagne.com/planifier/activites/activites-et-loisirs/bains-de-dorres-731038\">Bains de Dorre</a>s is a fabulous place.

On one of the few days we didn\u2019t ski, we took a day trip to Lake Bled. The castle on an island in the middle of the lake was adorned with picturesque snow and backed by the local peaks. Bled felt like a mix of touristy hotels and cafes, and a place where locals spend their weekends relaxing after a week of commuting to Ljubljana.

      "bodyText": "Winning tip: make tracks for northern Sweden Waking up to a pink Arctic sunrise over endless fir trees from my bunk on the overnight train from Stockholm to Abisko was the perfect start to a winter adventure. The STF Abisko Turiststation served as our base for every snow-related activity that you can imagine: I tried snowshoeing, husky sled driving and cross-country skiing. Equally enjoyable was warming up by one of the many fireplaces and gazing out at the beautiful frozen lake. And, due to the location where a climate phenomenon results in some of the clearest skies in Europe, it was also a wonderful place to watch the northern lights. Scandinavia is famously expensive but staying in the clean, comfortable dorm and cooking in the well-equipped kitchen helped with the costs. Pippa A budget ski break in Andorra Last year, due to rising costs and a smaller budget, we decided to forgo the Alps for our annual week of skiing and hit the slopes of the Pyrenees in Andorra instead. We stayed in El Pas de la Casa, a lively ski resort with access to the wider Grandvalira ski area. The town was more concrete than chocolate-box, but the mountains were just as pretty, and we had more than 210km (130 miles) of runs to explore with modern lifts and minimal queues. The best part? The holiday cost almost half as much as the Alps. Elliot Armstrong Hot springs of the Cerdagne valley North-west of Perpignan is the Cerdagne valley and Capcir, where you can find open-air hot spring baths from \u20ac6 per person. These are just a 20-minute drive from the various ski slopes, so you can work those quads in the morning, and then relax in the very healing warm waters in the afternoon. Bains de Dorres is a fabulous place. Also Bains de St Thomas, and Bains de Llo. There are also cheese farms for cow\u2019s, goat\u2019s and ewe\u2019s cheese, as well as a great food culture in the local shops. For a place to stay try Camping l\u2019Enclave, which has warm cabins in winter. You\u2019ll need a good car with winter tyres and those things you put on the wheels in the snow/ice.

      "bodyText": "The Jamaican Football Federation has reinstated the coach of its women\u2019s national team falsely claiming he has been cleared of allegations of serious misconduct by Fifa\u2019s Ethics Committee. Hubert Busby Jr returned to lead Jamaica women\u2019s national team in May this year, two and a half years after being suspended by the federation after a former player alleged he made sexual advances towards her while he was coach of the Vancouver Whitecaps women\u2019s team in 2010 and 2011. Announcing Busby\u2019s return in May this year, the Jamaican Football Federation said in a media release that \u201cafter careful consideration and due process, our technical committee has recommended the immediate reappointment of Hubert Busby as head coach of the Senior Women\u2019s National Team. He was removed from the position when the JFF requested Fifa to investigate unsavory media reports originating in Europe. Fifa subsequently cleared Mr Busby.\u201d Busby told media in Jamaica that \u201cit is important now to turn that page and sit in front of you knowing that the vindication is there.\u201d He added that his experience was part of \u201cGod\u2019s plan\u201d. Fifa, however, has confirmed to the Guardian that its Ethics Committee closed a preliminary investigation into allegations against Busby without reaching any judgment and that it may reopen an investigation if it receives more information about the original claims. The Guardian also understands that witnesses to the alleged misconduct \u2013 including former Vancouver Whitecaps player Maloree Enoch who made the initial claims against Busby \u2013 were never interviewed by Fifa\u2019s Ethics Committee. \u201cWith regard to the allegations against Mr Busby, the Investigatory Chamber of the Fifa Ethics Committee initiated a preliminary investigation into a potential breach of Article 23 (protection of physical and mental integrity) of the Fifa Code of Ethics,\u201d a Fifa spokesperson told the Guardian in a statement. \u201cWe can confirm that the preliminary investigation has been closed, in accordance with the Fifa Code of Ethics and statute of limitations that applied at the time of the alleged incidents.

The sources said Busby had been informed of the investigation\u2019s status in a letter sent to his lawyer prior to returning to the Jamaica position. Busby\u2019s lawyer declined to comment on whether or not he had been cleared by Fifa, but Busby has consistently denied any sort of misconduct. The general secretary of the Jamaica Football Federation, Dennis Chung, declined multiple requests for an interview or comment and was unable to provide evidence that Busby had been cleared of the allegations by Fifa. \u201cThe General Secretary has his papers in order,\u201d a JFF spokesperson told the Guardian, referring all questions regarding Busby\u2019s return to the national team position to Fifa. The allegations against Busby were made in 2021 by former Vancouver Whitecaps player Malloree Enoch who claimed the coach attempted to solicit sex from her during a prolonged recruitment process while he was in charge of the Whitecaps women\u2019s team in 2010 and 2011. Busby has denied the allegations.

They are&nbsp;not&nbsp;well known. I&nbsp;read them in my early teens. They are heavily autobiographical \u2013 Fitzgerald was writing&nbsp;about his own adolescence. For the first time, it seemed, a writer spoke directly to me. \u201cYes,\u201d I thought, \u201cthis is&nbsp;exactly how I feel.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The book that changed me as a teenager</strong><br>Catch-22 by Joseph Heller. I read it, utterly rapt, on an overnight flight from London to Lagos where my family was living at the time. It&nbsp;was 1970 and I was 18&nbsp;years old. I thought it&nbsp;was the most wonderful novel ever written: funny, cruel, absurd \u2013 defiantly, brilliantly anti-war. And&nbsp;I was flying into Nigeria\u2019s civil war, the Biafran war. Art&nbsp;and life&nbsp;conjoined.</p> <p><strong>The book that changed my mind</strong><br>Mister Johnson by Joyce&nbsp;Cary. Another African book about a young Nigerian clerk working for a district officer in the 1920s. When I was in my teens, growing up in Nigeria, we had a cook called Mr&nbsp;Johnson. That was what&nbsp;drew me to Cary\u2019s masterpiece and it was revelatory in its empathy and honesty. Cary opened my eyes to&nbsp;the Africa I was living in. I&nbsp;later, coincidentally, wrote an introduction to&nbsp;the book and, later still, adapted it for a&nbsp;film&nbsp;directed by Bruce&nbsp;Beresford.</p> <p><strong>The book that made me&nbsp;want to be a writer</strong><br>The Heart of the Matter by Graham Greene. The&nbsp;novel is set in Sierra&nbsp;Leone during the&nbsp;second world war \u2013 a&nbsp;west African country I&nbsp;had visited, very similar to the two countries I had lived in, Ghana and Nigeria. I&nbsp;read&nbsp;it in my late teens and for the first time I&nbsp;saw how personal experience of a&nbsp;place&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;its landscape, atmosphere, weather, textures \u2013 could be transformed into fiction, into art.</p> <p><strong>The </strong><strong>author I&nbsp;came back to</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/murielspark\">Muriel Spark</a>. I think I&nbsp;first read her work too&nbsp;young; I couldn\u2019t connect with her clever, oblique spareness, her dry, ironic take on the world. Then I was asked to review A Far Cry from&nbsp;Kensington, many years&nbsp;later. And I was suddenly hooked. I\u2019ve&nbsp;read everything she\u2019s written.</p> <p><strong>The book I reread</strong><br>Ulysses by James Joyce. I&nbsp;am an obsessive Joycean, as fascinated by the man as by the work. But I keep going back to Ulysses. I have about eight copies of it&nbsp;for some reason.</p> <p><strong>The book I could never read again</strong><br>The Lord of the Rings. I&nbsp;read it aged 12 and was&nbsp;entranced. That is&nbsp;the age to read Tolkien. Fantasy is a&nbsp;genre that I&nbsp;cannot abide&nbsp;any more.</p> <p><strong>The book I discovered later in life</strong><br>The Untouchable by&nbsp;John Banville.</p> <p><strong>The book I am currently reading</strong><br>The Echoes by Evie Wyld.</p> <p><strong>My comfort read</strong><br>Pale Fire by Vladimir Nabokov.</p> <p>\u2022 Gabriel\u2019s Moon by William Boyd is published by Viking.

The novel is set in Sierra Leone during the second world war \u2013 a west African country I had visited, very similar to the two countries I had lived in, Ghana and Nigeria. I read it in my late teens and for the first time I saw how personal experience of a place \u2013 its landscape, atmosphere, weather, textures \u2013 could be transformed into fiction, into art. The author I came back to Muriel Spark. I think I first read her work too young; I couldn\u2019t connect with her clever, oblique spareness, her dry, ironic take on the world. Then I was asked to review A Far Cry from Kensington, many years later. And I was suddenly hooked. I\u2019ve read everything she\u2019s written. The book I reread Ulysses by James Joyce. I am an obsessive Joycean, as fascinated by the man as by the work. But I keep going back to Ulysses. I have about eight copies of it for some reason. The book I could never read again The Lord of the Rings. I read it aged 12 and was entranced. That is the age to read Tolkien. Fantasy is a genre that I cannot abide any more. The book I discovered later in life The Untouchable by John Banville. The book I am currently reading The Echoes by Evie Wyld. My comfort read Pale Fire by Vladimir Nabokov. \u2022 Gabriel\u2019s Moon by William Boyd is published by Viking. To support the Guardian and Observer, order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.

Badenoch will not, either in detail or even in the abstract, for she has explicitly promised to \u201clead by consensus\u201d. What consensus? There is no agreement within the party about why its recent spell in government ended so disastrously; nor was there much agreement before the election about what it should actually do with power, which is why Sunak ended up not doing much of anything. That division has been an undercurrent throughout the current leadership contest: some One Nation MPs were spooked by Jenrick\u2019s early adoption of Suella Braverman\u2019s unsuccessful campaign while rightwingers were wary of Badenoch\u2019s record on questions such as tax and immigration. Either candidate\u2019s success as leader will hinge on whether they can find a way to overcome that division. But that doesn\u2019t mean keeping everyone on side by sticking to broad platitudes and waiting for the party in government to fail. That\u2019s what Labour did, and now it is paying the price \u2013 the exact same price the Tories will pay if they somehow regain office by such lazy means. No, to succeed the party\u2019s next leader is going to have to force an honest and painful reckoning. That means facing up to the gulf between the way the party governed and its professed values and, eventually and unavoidably, spelling out how it would govern differently next time. On every major policy, making a firm decision is going to anger and alienate parts of the party. A leader who can\u2019t win those battles is not prepared to lead; a leader who would prefer to avoid them is not prepared even to try. Henry Hill is deputy editor of ConservativeHome",

He comes with some insights you wouldn\u2019t get from a typical politician.\u201d</p> <p>Kennedy, who ended his own presidential run in August <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/23/robert-f-kennedy-jr-drops-out-endorses-trump\">to endorse Trump</a>, has already <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/rfk-usda-trump-agriculture-election-fda-c15c96af05f2b0f48521410578f2f7df\">suggested</a> he will help shape agricultural and health policy should the Republican nominee win.

The former president has taken aim at offshore wind, saying he will cancel projects <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/13/trump-president-agenda-climate-policy-wind-power\">on his first day in office</a> while accusing Harris, his Democratic opponent, of enabling the deaths of birds and whales. (Trump also, separately, <a href=\"https://x.com/atrupar/status/1847286325285654862\">told</a> a child on Fox News recently that Harris wants to ban cows. She does not.)</p> <p>\u201cYou want to see a bird cemetery? Just go under a windmill, you see thousands of birds dead,\u201d Trump has said. \u201cThey are all rusting and disgusting looking. It\u2019s the most expensive form of energy there is. It sounds so wonderful, the wind, the wind, the wind. Wind is bullshit, it\u2019s horrible. It\u2019s too expensive, it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d</p>    <p>This stance chimes with that of Kennedy, who in the early 2000s, as a prominent environmental lawyer, <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/22092024/robert-f-kennedy-jr-environmental-hero-to-outcast/\">helped</a> kill off a proposed offshore wind farm near his family\u2019s compound in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Since endorsing Trump, Kennedy has appeared with the prominent rightwing figures Jordan Peterson and Tucker Carlson to further tie this cause to the former president\u2019s campaign.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/27/rfk-jr-dead-whale\">RFK Jr faces call for investigation into claim he chainsawed whale\u2019s head off</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe Democrats are putting these offshore wind farms in, they are exterminating the whales,\u201d Kennedy told Carlson. \u201cThey are about to extinguish the right whales, the last ones on Earth, with these monstrosities.\u201d</p> <p>Kennedy has few qualms about onshore wind but has said that offshore wind is a \u201cboondoggle\u201d and that green groups and Democrats have \u201cthis fixation upon carbon alone\u201d.

I think of the grotesque contrast \u2013 between the hard-working women knocking doors in Northview and the free money being given away here to help a billionaire return to the White House. It feels a little like Musk\u2019s twisted version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/jun/06/new-hunger-games-suzanne-collins\">The Hunger Games</a>, the dystopian fantasy series in which a teenage girl is chosen by lottery to participate in a battle royale and ends up leading the resistance against a Capitol run by oligarchy.

Musk is, of course, not a member of the resistance, but neither is he a robber baron. He is, in fact, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/28/elon-musks-shadow-rule\">more powerful</a> and wealthy than Carnegie could ever have believed possible.

Many of Charleroi\u2019s community leaders refute Trump\u2019s presentation and point me instead to a real crisis here: the impending closure of a glassware factory that has operated for 132 years.

The first round of layoffs are to begin in December and spirits are understandably drab. I meet Heather Roberts, the president of the plant\u2019s union. She has worked here for 18 years and stands next to her aunt, April Sethman, who has been here for more than two decades. Roberts\u2019 father is working inside.

I am out with two women, Leslie Hughes and Luwaunna Adams, whom I met two years ago when we were making a video in western Pennsylvania \u2013 a perennial battleground region in the US\u2019s closest-fought swing state. The pair are members of the service workers\u2019 union, which represents lower-income cleaners and security personnel. They are also two of the most effective and persuasive canvassers I have encountered. As we trudge the streets, knocking doors in the crisp autumn air, we meet a number of apathetic voters who tell the women they are not planning to cast their ballot this time around. One young man named Rashad says he cannot understand how Hillary Clinton could win the popular vote in 2016 and yet lose the election. \u201cIf \u2018we the people\u2019 chose someone, but the electoral [system] chooses someone else, what\u2019s the point of my vote?\u201d he asks Adams. Another woman says she finds it impossible to discern \u201cwhich one is good and which one is bad\u201d \u2013 and so has decided to sit it out. Their disengagement is understandable \u2013 and perhaps more widespread than we understand. Polls are starting to indicate that turnout may be significantly lower than four years ago.

And an arcane electoral college is surely enough to make many grow disillusioned. But Hughes and Adams do not give up.

Elon Musk has decamped to Pennsylvania to help Trump win here, spending at least $75m via his organisation America Pac. It is a different crowd to your standard Maga rally. There is a mixture of young and old. Some describe themselves as political independents. Others claim to have voted for Joe Biden last time around. As Musk fields questions, there is a bizarre, chaotic clash of conspiracy theories and requests for investment and personal advice. Of course, there is also Musk\u2019s new (and potentially illegal) stunt: the daily $1m giveaway to a lucky signatory of his \u201cfree speech\u201d petition. I watch from the media pen as the audience erupts in cheers when the winner is brought down from the balcony. I think of the grotesque contrast \u2013 between the hard-working women knocking doors in Northview and the free money being given away here to help a billionaire return to the White House. It feels a little like Musk\u2019s twisted version of The Hunger Games, the dystopian fantasy series in which a teenage girl is chosen by lottery to participate in a battle royale and ends up leading the resistance against a Capitol run by oligarchy.

      "bodyText": "On Ukraine\u2019s frontline, soldiers hold Russian forces at bay with American weapons and ammunition. Across the country, American air defences protect civilians from Moscow\u2019s missiles and drones. So for Ukrainians, the outcome of the US presidential election could be a matter of life and death. If the arms pipeline slows or halts, grinding Russian advances across the eastern front in recent months could accelerate, and hospitals, schools, power stations and homes would become more vulnerable. Europe\u2019s political support is indispensable and its weapons appreciated, but Washington\u2019s donations of military aid over nearly three years of war, at more than $64bn, eclipse those provided by all other allies put together. Donald Trump has made no secret of his desire to \u201cend the war\u201d, and cut that spending. He has repeatedly attempted to block aid packages in Congress and has been promising \u2013 or threatening \u2013 to force Moscow and Kyiv to reach a deal before the US presidential inauguration in January. While Trump has been vague about the shape of a potential agreement, his running mate, JD Vance, has laid out a plan that critics describe as tantamount to a Russian victory, with Moscow keeping de facto control over Ukrainian territory it occupies now and Ukraine left outside Nato. \u201cWe are worried about Trump,\u201d a senior official in Kyiv said bluntly. Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Trump\u2019s shared background in entertainment television has not eased the relationship. In September, Zelenskyy secured a meeting with Trump in New York to plead Ukraine\u2019s cause, the first time the two men had come face to face in five years. Trump preceded the meeting with a dose of public humiliation, sharing a private message from the Ukrainian leader on social media, and weeks later blamed Zelenskyy for starting the war. In an interview with the Guardian in late May, Zelenskyy admitted he had \u201cno strategy yet\u201d for what to do if Trump returned to the White House, though he suggested the outline of a plan rooted in an appeal to the candidate\u2019s vanity. He warned Trump that he risked being tagged as a \u201closer president\u201d if he allowed Russia to win the war. Trump might be able to broker a ceasefire deal, Zelenskyy said, but Putin\u2019s track record suggests Moscow would eventually violate it and push further into Ukraine, making the US president look \u201cvery weak\u201d. Just days out from the election, some Ukrainian officials say this scenario gives them cause to be cautiously optimistic about a possible Trump presidency, in the hope that a humiliated Trump would then pivot to backing Ukraine. It may be risky to gamble on Putin and Trump sabotaging their own interests through vanity, hubris and mutual miscalculation. But Russia\u2019s willingness to conscript soldiers on a huge scale, and send them to die in vast numbers on the battlefield, is slowly eroding Ukraine\u2019s initial advantage on the battlefield. The liberation of Kyiv and parts of the east and south was rooted in superior military skills, weapons and motivation, but three years on tens of thousands of Ukrainian forces are dead, injured or exhausted. Ukraine has a much smaller population than Russia, everyone who wanted to serve is already in uniform and as a democracy it struggles with conscription. \u201cEveryone understands that Trump doesn\u2019t care one bit about Ukraine, and that a Trump presidency would be a trip to the casino for Ukraine: we could win big or we could lose everything,\u201d said a source in Ukraine\u2019s security structures. \u201cBut by now everyone is exhausted, and some people are willing to make risky bets. Trump is useful to Putin, because he can create chaos, but he can also be unhelpful, Putin doesn\u2019t like it when others have the initiative,\u201d said the source. A victory for Kamala Harris would probably be met in Kyiv with relief that the country now faces a \u201cless bad\u201d option, rather than with full-bodied enthusiasm. She is expected to be a more predictable counterpart than Trump would be, broadly continuing Joe Biden\u2019s policy approach, although Ukrainians are still trying to gauge her personal position on the conflict. She has not visited Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022 and although she has met Zelenskyy at least half a dozen times during her vice-presidency, she has usually been passing on messages from Biden rather than setting the agenda. Zelenskyy\u2019s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, has set up a contact channel with Philip Gordon, Harris\u2019s national security adviser, to bolster ties and deepen understanding of where Harris\u2019s position dovetails with Biden\u2019s and where it might diverge. The outgoing president has balanced strong diplomatic support and generous military aid for Kyiv with restrictions on the transfer and use of American technology, largely because of concerns about escalation, which have infuriated many officials in Kyiv. Putin has repeatedly threatened to deploy Russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal. Although intelligence services believe these are not empty threats, American donations to Ukraine have gradually expanded over the past three years. In early 2022, donations of anti-tank missiles were the focus of military transfers. Three years on Ukraine is receiving some of the most advanced parts of the US arsenal, including long-range missiles \u2013 though with a bar on using them on targets inside Russia \u2013 Patriot air defence systems and F-16 jets provided by European allies. But critics say each authorisation to transfer a new category of arms comes so slowly, and so late, that it undermines their effectiveness on the battlefield. Frustration has been mounting in recent months over \u201ca drip-drip policy of managed escalation\u201d that Ukraine sees as characteristic of the Biden administration. They fear that if that continues under a Harris administration, it could ultimately be nearly as damaging to Ukraine\u2019s future as pressure from a Trump administration to reach an immediate deal. But they may be able to get more traction in coming months with a longstanding argument that US concerns about escalation should be weighed carefully against the potential impact of in effect losing to Russia. \u201cThe Chinese, the Indians and of course the Russians see this as America\u2019s war,\u201d said one security official in Kyiv. \u201cThe US already had a huge catastrophe with the withdrawal from Afghanistan. If they lost Ukraine after three years, they will lose all [military credibility].\u201d This month thousands of North Korean soldiers joined Russian troops on the ground, which many have seen as grim proof of Kyiv\u2019s longstanding insistence that the war has never just been about Ukraine\u2019s future. As pressure to open negotiations with Russia grows, Ukraine can only hope that those voices in the next presidential administration who believe Washington\u2019s power is tied to Kyiv\u2019s fate are louder and more influential than officials calling to end the conflict now, regardless of the immediate or long-term costs of brokering a deal with Moscow. \u201cThere is no favourite candidate in Ukraine.

Her investigation of the sound and its origins involves a disappearing audio engineer, car alarms going off by themselves, the discovery of ancient bones, and a man who remembers everything.

But in Nathan and David Zellner\u2019s version, the subject is Bigfoot. In the remote forests of North America, a hairy, grunting sasquatch family (two of whom are, inexplicably, played by Riley Keough and Jesse Eisenberg) eat leaves, have sex, sniff skunks and make fruitless attempts to locate more of their own species.

As the wife who \u201csurvived\u201d, Alicia Vikander has rarely been better \u2013 struggling to hold on to her limited power while negotiating the moods of her ailing king (a gloriously unsexy turn by Jude Law) and the unsettled religious state of the nation, where the wrong move could be a death sentence. Simon Russell Beale is a stealthy foe as Bishop Stephen Gardiner, who suspects her, correctly, of dangerously modern thinking. <br><em>Thursday 7 November, Prime Video</em></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Tamara Drewe</h2>    <p>Based on the 2005 Guardian comic strip by Posy Simmonds (itself a riff on Far from the Madding Crowd), Stephen Frears\u2019s jolly comedy has a journalist \u2013 played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/19/gemma-arterton-in-real-life-im-quite-silly\">Gemma Arterton</a> \u2013 returning to her rural childhood home and throwing a spanner in the lives of everyone she meets. These include Roger Allam\u2019s self-satisfied crime author, his long-suffering wife (Tamsin Greig) and a Thomas Hardy scholar (Bill Camp) visiting their writers\u2019 retreat, as sexual politics and romantic drama collide juicily. <br><em>Thursday 7 November, 9pm, BBC Four</em></p> <p>***</p> <h2>The Great Dictator</h2>    <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/18/chaplin-great-dictator-comedy\">remarkable film</a> to be made at a time when the US was yet to join the war against Germany, Charlie Chaplin\u2019s 1940 satire is a bold, comic takedown of Hitler \u2013 ridiculing his pomposity while exposing what was then known about his violent persecution of the Jewish people. Parallel narratives follow Adenoid Hynkel, fascist ruler of Tomainia, and an unnamed Jewish barber (both played by Chaplin), doppelgangers whose lives are fated to cross. There are a few trademark skits \u2013 a food fight, a shave to the music of Brahms \u2013 but there\u2019s a serious point to be made, and Chaplin forces it home. <br><em>Friday 8 November, 2pm, Sky Arts</em></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Airplane!</h2>    <p>A comedy with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/02/airplane-film-40th-anniversary-spoof-comedy\">arguably the most gags per minute</a> of any Hollywood film ever, this classic from Jim Abrahams and David and Jerry Zucker takes the disaster movie genre and tickles it to death. The plot is about a commercial flight where the crew are incapacitated and a traumatised former pilot (Robert Hays) has to land it \u2013 but that\u2019s not important right now. Venerable movie actors Leslie Nielsen, Lloyd Bridges and Robert Stack gained a new lease of life by allowing themselves to be ridiculous while a series of brilliant, barely connected jokes zip by. <br><em>Friday 8 November, 12.05am, Channel 4</em></p>",

Sunday 3 November, 10.10am, 10pm, Sky Cinema Premiere *** Firebrand Karim A\u00efnouz\u2019s enthralling historical yarn sees the end times of Henry VIII\u2019s reign through the eyes of his final queen, Katherine Parr. As the wife who \u201csurvived\u201d, Alicia Vikander has rarely been better \u2013 struggling to hold on to her limited power while negotiating the moods of her ailing king (a gloriously unsexy turn by Jude Law) and the unsettled religious state of the nation, where the wrong move could be a death sentence. Simon Russell Beale is a stealthy foe as Bishop Stephen Gardiner, who suspects her, correctly, of dangerously modern thinking. Thursday 7 November, Prime Video *** Tamara Drewe Based on the 2005 Guardian comic strip by Posy Simmonds (itself a riff on Far from the Madding Crowd), Stephen Frears\u2019s jolly comedy has a journalist \u2013 played by Gemma Arterton \u2013 returning to her rural childhood home and throwing a spanner in the lives of everyone she meets. These include Roger Allam\u2019s self-satisfied crime author, his long-suffering wife (Tamsin Greig) and a Thomas Hardy scholar (Bill Camp) visiting their writers\u2019 retreat, as sexual politics and romantic drama collide juicily. Thursday 7 November, 9pm, BBC Four *** The Great Dictator A remarkable film to be made at a time when the US was yet to join the war against Germany, Charlie Chaplin\u2019s 1940 satire is a bold, comic takedown of Hitler \u2013 ridiculing his pomposity while exposing what was then known about his violent persecution of the Jewish people. Parallel narratives follow Adenoid Hynkel, fascist ruler of Tomainia, and an unnamed Jewish barber (both played by Chaplin), doppelgangers whose lives are fated to cross. There are a few trademark skits \u2013 a food fight, a shave to the music of Brahms \u2013 but there\u2019s a serious point to be made, and Chaplin forces it home. Friday 8 November, 2pm, Sky Arts *** Airplane! A comedy with arguably the most gags per minute of any Hollywood film ever, this classic from Jim Abrahams and David and Jerry Zucker takes the disaster movie genre and tickles it to death. The plot is about a commercial flight where the crew are incapacitated and a traumatised former pilot (Robert Hays) has to land it \u2013 but that\u2019s not important right now. Venerable movie actors Leslie Nielsen, Lloyd Bridges and Robert Stack gained a new lease of life by allowing themselves to be ridiculous while a series of brilliant, barely connected jokes zip by. Friday 8 November, 12.05am, Channel 4",

The building society\u2019s monthly index showed that annual house prices grew at a rate of 2.4% in October, a slowdown from the near two-year high of 3.2% recorded in September. This was still the third highest rate of annual growth since December 2022, but was lower than experts had forecast, with a Reuters poll of economists predicting a 2.8% increase for the month.

      "bodyText": "A plan by climate activists to shut down the Port of Newcastle for 50 hours has been challenged by New South Wales police who have argued in a court challenge against the protest going ahead. Police are challenging the protest \u2013 which is planned for 19 November \u2013 in the supreme court. It\u2019s the second time in a month police have challenged a protest in court. Organised by a group called Rising Tide, the protest would involve thousands of activists paddling into the Port of Newcastle on kayaks and rafts to stop coal exports from leaving Newcastle for 50 hours. The group are calling the protest the \u201cPeople\u2019s Blockade of the World\u2019s Largest Coal Port\u201d. A week-long \u201cprotestival\u201d expected to attract 5,500 demonstrators is scheduled to take place alongside the blockade, and includes music performances.

If the application is accepted, it would protect protesters from being prosecuted for blocking the waterway during that timeframe. On Friday, the court heard from witnesses appearing for the police in the first day of hearings that about 30 ships would be blocked from exiting and entering the harbour over the 50 hours, creating a significant backlog. Rising Tide\u2019s lawyer Neal Funnell urged Justice Desmond Fagan to consider the economic impacts of climate change and the impact the fossil fuel industry \u201cplays in that\u201d.

Lachlan Gyles SC, who represented the commissioner of police, argued the planned two-day protest blocking the harbour was a safety risk. He also said the duration of the full protest, scheduled for seven days, would restrict the public\u2019s use of the area. \u201cThe police are not trying to stop people from expressing views about this issue, that\u2019s an important part of democracy,\u201d Giles said. \u201cIt\u2019s whether it\u2019s done safely and isn\u2019t done in a way that disrupts activities and lives of people in Newcastle. \u201cSometimes the impingement upon a person\u2019s right to do what they do on the weekend \u2026 outweighs the important public right of free speech and public assembly and democracy.\u201d It is the second year in a row that Rising Tide have planned such an action. In 2023, police accepted the group\u2019s form 1 to block the port for 30 hours. The protest drew international attention when NSW police charged more than 100 people after protesters blocked the coal port beyond the agreed deadline.

      "bodyText": "Garry Kasparov, who many consider the all-time No 1 in competition with Bobby Fischer and Magnus Carlsen, has been back in action this week in the $150,000 Chess 9LX tournament at St Louis. In Chess 9LX, also known as Fischer Random, Freestyle Chess or Chess 960, the placing of the back rank pieces is decided randomly by lot. At 61, Kasparov still has it. Competing against the cream of US grandmasters, he made a 50% 4.5/9 total and missed chances to do still better due to his problems with handling the fast time limit of 20 minutes per player per game, with a 10 seconds per move increment. He missed winning chances against both the world No 2 and reigning US champion, Fabiano Caruana, who won the Chess 9LX event, and against the world No 3 Hikaru Nakamura, where instead of repeating moves by 38\u2026Bc5? Black should play 38\u2026Qb4! 39 Rxc6 Qd2+ 40 Kh3 Bg1! and White is lost. Kasparov\u2019s scalps were the world No 12, Leinier Dom\u00ednguez, where the final stages were captured on camera, the 2023 winner and rising talent, Samuel Sevian, and the 2018 US champion, Sam Shankland.

      "body": "<p>As the thoroughbred horse racing industry fades in America, I think back on the days when it was my life. I think a lot about what became of the thousands of horses I exercised. When I find myself locked in that headspace, the face of one kind little gelding haunts me. Dodgen Bullets, a Bob Baffert trainee, was no star and never going to be much as it was said, but he was willing and like all racehorses painfully innocent. We were young at the seaside in late summer at Del Mar racetrack, where this year\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup will be held over the the weekend. I exercised him into his first race, a Maiden Special Weight for two-year-olds which he won decisively. His connections pocketed over $50,000 in purse money and, aside from the $12 a day I made exercising him, I collected nearly $500 betting on his victory. As he was led back to the barn sweat-drenched, maybe frightened, I was clinking champagne and high on dopamine. These many years later I see how twisted my show of gratitude to him was.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"895a3a01-6e43-43ec-9d00-b7f8783fdaf2\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Computer-assisted wagering (CAW) in thoroughbred racing uses algorithms and software to analyze vast data sets on horses, jockeys and races to make highly calculated bets, often placed by large teams or syndicates. CAW can predict odds fluctuations and identify betting inefficiencies, enabling large-scale, automated betting across multiple races and tracks. These systems often place wagers in real-time, sometimes only seconds before a race begins, putting the everyday punters who largely fund the betting pools at a disadvantage.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Despite that win I had no interest in gambling, was ignorant of the whole procedure, and fearful of losing the little money I had. Where I didn\u2019t contribute to the handle, many other racetrackers did daily. It is a way for underpaid backside workers to shore up low wages. Over the last decade while poverty on the backside hasn\u2019t much improved, and while horses are still endlessly churned through the industry without any mandated lifelong protection, track operators are exploiting the system to curate a more financially appealing landscape for themselves. Tracks like Del Mar serve up their retail customers, everyday bettors, to computer-assisted wagering (CAW) teams who use the wagering pools those customers create like a parasite does a host, and who work based off <a href=\"https://www.thoroughbreddailynews.com/computer-assisted-wagering-anatomy-of-a-deal/\">big figure deals</a> with the tracks. Industry heavyweights like The Stronach Group, New York Racing Association, and Churchill Downs <a href=\"https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/277723/balance-between-caw-retail-market-sought-in-california\">own</a> the platforms these teams use to gamble on. Scott Daruty, president of Stronach-owned gambling entities Monarch Content Management and Elite Turf Club, said he does not see a conflict because ownership gives track operators \u201ca direct relationship with our biggest customers\u201d, and \u201can understanding that we wouldn\u2019t have were middlemen conducting this activity\u201d, so it is \u201cthe right thing in my opinion\u201d, he told California Horse Racing Board commissioners.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/may/03/twelve-horses-died-around-the-kentucky-derby-last-year-little-has-changed-since\">Twelve horses died around the Kentucky Derby last year. Little has changed since | Elizabeth Banicki</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The greatest advantage these nerd cliques receive over the grandparents who bet on weekends, the broke student, or the backside worker is through special rates and significant rebates tied to their track deals. According to Pat Cummings, executive director of the National Thoroughbred Alliance who spoke to horsemen on a <a href=\"https://paulickreport.com/news/horseplayers-category/computer-assisted-wagering-why-horsemens-groups-should-be-paying-attention\">panel in July</a>, CAWs use \u201cfinely honed systems, algorithms that sense vast amounts of data and place their bets in very quick fashion, oftentimes right before the race begins \u2026 they are able to batch bet\u201d. The average bettor\u2019s weakness is the CAWs target for profit but it is a balance because without the average bettor sustaining the pool the CAW model fails.</p> \n<p>While CAW play has grown in recent years, run-of-the-mill wagering has not. In fact in the last two decades non-CAW wagering is down by two-thirds while a dozen or so \u201chigh frequency bettors\u201d constitutes about one third of all betting on US thoroughbred racing, Cummings said at a <a href=\"https://jockeyclub.com/default.asp?section=RT&amp;year=2023&amp;area=5\">Jockey Club panel discussion</a>.

      "bodyText": "As the thoroughbred horse racing industry fades in America, I think back on the days when it was my life. I think a lot about what became of the thousands of horses I exercised. When I find myself locked in that headspace, the face of one kind little gelding haunts me. Dodgen Bullets, a Bob Baffert trainee, was no star and never going to be much as it was said, but he was willing and like all racehorses painfully innocent. We were young at the seaside in late summer at Del Mar racetrack, where this year\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup will be held over the the weekend. I exercised him into his first race, a Maiden Special Weight for two-year-olds which he won decisively. His connections pocketed over $50,000 in purse money and, aside from the $12 a day I made exercising him, I collected nearly $500 betting on his victory. As he was led back to the barn sweat-drenched, maybe frightened, I was clinking champagne and high on dopamine. These many years later I see how twisted my show of gratitude to him was. Despite that win I had no interest in gambling, was ignorant of the whole procedure, and fearful of losing the little money I had. Where I didn\u2019t contribute to the handle, many other racetrackers did daily. It is a way for underpaid backside workers to shore up low wages. Over the last decade while poverty on the backside hasn\u2019t much improved, and while horses are still endlessly churned through the industry without any mandated lifelong protection, track operators are exploiting the system to curate a more financially appealing landscape for themselves. Tracks like Del Mar serve up their retail customers, everyday bettors, to computer-assisted wagering (CAW) teams who use the wagering pools those customers create like a parasite does a host, and who work based off big figure deals with the tracks. Industry heavyweights like The Stronach Group, New York Racing Association, and Churchill Downs own the platforms these teams use to gamble on. Scott Daruty, president of Stronach-owned gambling entities Monarch Content Management and Elite Turf Club, said he does not see a conflict because ownership gives track operators \u201ca direct relationship with our biggest customers\u201d, and \u201can understanding that we wouldn\u2019t have were middlemen conducting this activity\u201d, so it is \u201cthe right thing in my opinion\u201d, he told California Horse Racing Board commissioners. The greatest advantage these nerd cliques receive over the grandparents who bet on weekends, the broke student, or the backside worker is through special rates and significant rebates tied to their track deals. According to Pat Cummings, executive director of the National Thoroughbred Alliance who spoke to horsemen on a panel in July, CAWs use \u201cfinely honed systems, algorithms that sense vast amounts of data and place their bets in very quick fashion, oftentimes right before the race begins \u2026 they are able to batch bet\u201d. The average bettor\u2019s weakness is the CAWs target for profit but it is a balance because without the average bettor sustaining the pool the CAW model fails. While CAW play has grown in recent years, run-of-the-mill wagering has not. In fact in the last two decades non-CAW wagering is down by two-thirds while a dozen or so \u201chigh frequency bettors\u201d constitutes about one third of all betting on US thoroughbred racing, Cummings said at a Jockey Club panel discussion. Cummings says his research indicates there are \u201c10 or 12 top-tier players in America who are using this approach. \u2026 Those 10 to 12 players probably represent somewhere between $2bn to $3bn of US thoroughbred racing\u2019s $11.6bn wagered last year [2023].\u201d Many bettors say they think those are conservative estimates. Another strongly shared belief among average bettors is that CAWs also receive internal pool information that further boosts their advantages. It is an area ripe for investigations into potential gaming laws violations and so very racetrack. Horse racing as it has existed in North America is dying and as a track friend grimly described, the tracks are \u201cinviting vultures to pick the bones of the carcass\u201d.

But, as 50 Years of Music underlines, he has enjoyed an intriguing parallel career away from Roxy Music \u2013 one that takes in everything from working with Pink Floyd and Tim Finn (he first encountered Finn\u2019s band <a href=\"https://www.allmusic.com/artist/split-enz-mn0000747757\">Split Enz </a>while touring Australia in the 70s, and they\u2019ve sporadically collaborated ever since) to his and Brian Eno\u2019s deliberately short-lived mid-70s band <a href=\"https://www.electronicsound.co.uk/features/time-machine/801-the-supergroup-that-lasted-six-weeks/\">801</a>, to albums filled with psychedelic rock and music inspired by South America.</p> <p>Central and South America are rooted in Manzanera\u2019s youth. He had already led an extraordinary life before he answered Roxy Music\u2019s ad, spending his childhood in Cuba \u2013 he can remember sheltering in the bathroom of the family home in Havana as Fidel Castro\u2019s Barbudos revolutionaries fought a gun battle in their back garden \u2013 and Hawaii, before being packed off to boarding school in Britain. His mother was Colombian. His father was an Englishman who ostensibly worked for the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) airline, but circumstantial evidence suggests he was probably a spy (and possibly the model for Wormold, the lead character in Graham Greene\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/133394.Our_Man_in_Havana\">Our Man in Havana</a>).</p> <p>In fact, Manzanera\u2019s family history was even more exotic than he first realised. When he was 40, his aunt told him that his father was, in fact, the son of a Neapolitan opera singer called Mr Sparano. \u201cShe thought I was going to be upset, but I thought it was fantastic, exciting, he wasn\u2019t some boring guy from Kent.\u201d Then, when attempting to get a Spanish passport after Brexit by proving he had Sephardic Jewish heritage, he discovered he was a direct descendant of Moses Cohen Henriques, the 17th century\u2019s most famous Jewish pirate of the Caribbean. \u201cI found a painting of him,\u201d laughs Manzanera, \u201cand he looks like me on the cover of the first Roxy album. Long hair, boots \u2013 absolute ringer!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>I understand Avalon better now \u2013 Bryan\u2019s a fine artist. But I was more rebellious</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nevertheless, it was his time in Cuba that most affected him creatively. The first music he learned to play \u2013 on his mother\u2019s guitar \u2013 was \u201cboleros and all that type of thing, the acoustic music people later heard on Buena Vista Social Club\u201d. As he points out, the homegrown musical culture of Cuba was so strong, \u201ca groove that was so much part of social and cultural life\u201d, that rock\u2019n\u2019roll struggled to make any impact.</p> <p>He can remember being taken to Havana\u2019s famous El Tropicana nightclub as a child \u2013 \u201cthere was a fabulous recreation of it in The Godfather Part II, set exactly when I was there, Christmas 1958\u201d \u2013 and seeing <a href=\"https://celiacruz.com/\">Celia Cruz</a> and pianist <a href=\"https://worldcircuit.co.uk/artists/ruben-gonzalez/\">Rub\u00e9n Gonz\u00e1lez</a> perform. \u201cNobody asked me anything about my background or South America in the whole 12 years of Roxy. Latin music had a weird image in Britain \u2013 it was all Edmundo Ros and Carmen Miranda with bowls of fruit on her head. I sort of kept quiet about it, I was a bit embarrassed. In Roxy, they were a bit older than me. I just wanted to learn and get on with it. But [Cuban music] was bursting to get out of me; I had to stick it into Roxy somehow by stealth. So I played a 6/8 echo groove against [drummer] Paul Thompson\u2019s 4/4 beat \u2013 the 6/8 time signature is the basis of cumbia.\u201d</p> <p>Once he was away from Roxy, Manzanera\u2019s musical influences came gushing out: the opening track of his 1975 solo debut, Diamond Head, was called Frontera and featured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/31/my-hero-robert-wyatt-jonathan-coe\">Robert Wyatt </a>singing in Spanish. And his South American roots were made more explicit still on 1990\u2019s Southern Cross \u2013 featuring his retelling of his childhood experience of the Cuban revolution, the track Dr Fidel \u2013 and 1999\u2019s Vozero.</p>    <p>In fact, you get the feeling that a considerable amount of Manzanera\u2019s solo work was a reaction to Roxy Music, in which life always seems to have been slightly fraught. He once compared the band to a Rolls-Royce he bought at the height of their success: beautiful, but so difficult to drive that it was best only occasionally taken out of the garage. Certainly, Manzanera\u2019s stark, drum-machine-driven 1982 instrumental album Primitive Guitars sounds like a response to the lushness and intricacy of Roxy Music\u2019s final album, Avalon, the making of which was so strained that Manzanera departed the band after the subsequent tour by shaking Bryan Ferry\u2019s hand and offering the words: \u201cGoodbye \u2013 it\u2019s been a great pressure working with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, absolutely, 100%,\u201d he nods. \u201cI understand [the sound of Avalon] better now, because Bryan\u2019s a fine artist and it\u2019s his work of art. But I was more rebellious.

      "body": "<h2><strong>The prosecution: Ellen</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Rog doesn\u2019t get drunk in the theatre, but my reputation could suffer if he\u2019s seen taking a swig</p> </blockquote> <p>I work in a theatre and get free tickets to a lot of shows. But every time I bring my husband Rog, we have the same discussion about him sneaking in his hip flask.</p> <p>I love Rog, and I like how he\u2019s good at smuggling drinks into festivals and events. He\u2019s very good at making things fun and helping us save money, but I\u2019d rather not have him be known as \u201cthe guy with the hip flask\u201d at my place of work. Every time I take him to a show, Rog wants to bring in \u201cMr Aspinal\u201d, a little flask in a leather case.</p> <p>I\u2019m not worried about his drinking \u2013 he likes a drink socially and I suppose the theatre is a social occasion for him.<strong> </strong>Rog says he has an emotional attachment to Mr Aspinal because it was a wedding present from his best man, but I don\u2019t think that justifies it. It\u2019s embarrassing. There are also often free drinks at press nights anyway, so it\u2019s unnecessary.</p> <p>It wouldn\u2019t be so bad if I didn\u2019t work in theatre, but when we\u2019re attending a press night, or we\u2019re with people we know, I want to make a good impression. I\u2019ve just started a job at a new theatre and I don\u2019t want friends and colleagues to think we are cheap. I feel it\u2019s reasonable to ask that Mr Aspinal stays at home.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>In my wedding speech, I said Rog brings the fun, that he\u2019s the \u2018chief entertainment officer\u2019 in our relationship</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When Rog and I first started dating, I took him to see Waiting For Godot at a theatre festival in Wales. Throughout the play I heard him opening tinnies. It was quite jarring, but because it was early days, I didn\u2019t say anything. </p> <p>Eight years later, we are now married and things have progressed to the hip flask. It\u2019s more discreet than opening a can of beer, but I just can\u2019t bear the thought of him sneaking drinks into my theatre and someone seeing him. </p> <p>In my wedding speech, I said Rog brings the fun, that he\u2019s the \u201cchief entertainment officer\u201d in our relationship. I love him for that, but it would distract from my work and affect my reputation if people saw him take a hip flask out and take a swig from it during a performance.

      "bodyText": "The prosecution: Ellen Rog doesn\u2019t get drunk in the theatre, but my reputation could suffer if he\u2019s seen taking a swig I work in a theatre and get free tickets to a lot of shows. But every time I bring my husband Rog, we have the same discussion about him sneaking in his hip flask. I love Rog, and I like how he\u2019s good at smuggling drinks into festivals and events. He\u2019s very good at making things fun and helping us save money, but I\u2019d rather not have him be known as \u201cthe guy with the hip flask\u201d at my place of work. Every time I take him to a show, Rog wants to bring in \u201cMr Aspinal\u201d, a little flask in a leather case. I\u2019m not worried about his drinking \u2013 he likes a drink socially and I suppose the theatre is a social occasion for him. Rog says he has an emotional attachment to Mr Aspinal because it was a wedding present from his best man, but I don\u2019t think that justifies it. It\u2019s embarrassing. There are also often free drinks at press nights anyway, so it\u2019s unnecessary. It wouldn\u2019t be so bad if I didn\u2019t work in theatre, but when we\u2019re attending a press night, or we\u2019re with people we know, I want to make a good impression. I\u2019ve just started a job at a new theatre and I don\u2019t want friends and colleagues to think we are cheap. I feel it\u2019s reasonable to ask that Mr Aspinal stays at home. When Rog and I first started dating, I took him to see Waiting For Godot at a theatre festival in Wales. Throughout the play I heard him opening tinnies. It was quite jarring, but because it was early days, I didn\u2019t say anything. Eight years later, we are now married and things have progressed to the hip flask. It\u2019s more discreet than opening a can of beer, but I just can\u2019t bear the thought of him sneaking drinks into my theatre and someone seeing him. In my wedding speech, I said Rog brings the fun, that he\u2019s the \u201cchief entertainment officer\u201d in our relationship. I love him for that, but it would distract from my work and affect my reputation if people saw him take a hip flask out and take a swig from it during a performance. I\u2019d really like the backing of Guardian readers on this matter. The defence: Rog As long as I\u2019m being discreet, what does it matter to Ellen what other people think?

      "body": "<p>For Will Oliver, an arable farmer in Leicestershire, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/autumn-budget-2024\">Labour\u2019s first budget in 14 years</a> was a shock: despite the signals beforehand that inheritance tax was going to be a key source of tax revenue, his reaction was still one of disbelief.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think they were going to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is big. It\u2019s massive.\u201d</p> <p>Agricultural property has been passed on to heirs tax-free for decades, but the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced on Wednesday that from April 2026 farms and other business property will fall within inheritance tax. Inheritors will have to pay 20% of the value of the agricultural and business property above \u00a31m, raising \u00a31.8bn by 2030 that can be used to improve public services.</p> <p>The announcement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/reeves-accused-of-betraying-small-family-firms-with-inheritance-tax-rises\">caused uproar among much of the farming sector</a>, and opposition parties rounded on the government. Yet many tax experts and campaigners argue that for all the political backlash, the vast majority of family farms will still not pay a levy that is aimed at some of the wealthiest people in Britain.</p> <p>The National Farmers\u2019 Union complained that Labour had broken a promise not to tamper with agricultural property relief (APR). Victoria Vyvyan, president of the Country Land and Business Association, said it was a \u201cbetrayal\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf this is a government of growth and investment, they have failed the rural economy,\u201d she said, arguing that it would reduce investment in higher-productivity technologies on British farms. Jeremy Clarkson, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/may/03/clarksons-farm-season-three-review\">former Top Gear presenter turned celebrity farmer</a>, also waded in.</p> <p>\u201cFarmers,\u201d Clarkson said on the X social network, \u201cI know that you have been shafted today. But please don\u2019t despair. Just look after yourselves for five short years and this shower will be gone.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Clarkson himself \u2013 or rather the prospective beneficiaries of his estate \u2013 may be among those \u201cshafted\u201d. Clarkson has previously said that he bought his 126-hectare (312-acre), \u00a34.25m farm, Diddly Squat, in order to avoid inheritance tax on his estate. In a 2021 interview with The Times Clarkson said that avoiding inheritance tax was \u201cthe critical thing\u201d in his decision to buy the farm.</p> <p>Assuming that \u2013 whatever the difficulties shown on the hit Clarkson\u2019s Farm TV series \u2013 the valuation of the farm has not fallen below the new \u00a31m threshold, it is likely that Clarkson\u2019s estate would now be liable for a significantly greater inheritance tax bill. Clarkson did not respond to a request for comment.</p>    <p>Oliver, who is 35 with two children, spent the night after the budget in a maize field in a combine harvester. He argued that the tax would add an extra cost for farmers. If working farms had to find that money, \u201cfood prices are going to have to go up, surely\u201d, he said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a fourth-generation on the family farm, don\u2019t own the farm,\u201d he said. The farm is owned by his father. \u201cIf anything happened, God forbid, it could have a huge impact,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cFarmers are struggling anyway, and this is going to be another cost for the business,\u201d he said, suggesting that some farming families would have to sell off fields to pay the inheritance tax bills. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take long before there\u2019s not much farm left.\u201d</p> <p>George Dunn, the chief executive of the Tenant Farmers\u2019 Association, argued that some of his members could also be affected indirectly if large estates sold up to pay inheritance tax bills.</p> <p>\u201cWe are fearful that we will see a bit of a kneejerk reaction from estates,\u201d he said. \u201cTenants might find themselves unseated from their farms.\u201d</p> <p>Yet tax experts question whether the archetypal \u201cfamily farm\u201d will truly be affected. Pre-budget analysis by the Centre for the Analysis of Taxation (CenTax) suggested that <a href=\"https://centax.org.uk/inheritance-tax-reliefs-time-for-reform/\">only 200 estates out of 1,300</a> a year between 2018 and 2020 claimed more than \u00a31m in relief each year. Those 200 estates \u2013 by definition among the wealthiest in Britain \u2013 reaped 64% of all the agricultural relief.</p> <p>The updated relief can in fact be even more generous for true family farms than the \u00a31m headline. A married couple owning a farm together can split it in two, meaning it qualifies for \u00a32m of agricultural property relief, plus another \u00a3500,000 for each partner if a property is involved. That means a farm worth \u00a33m might pay zero inheritance tax, said Arun Advani, associate professor of economics at the University of Warwick and a director of CenTax.</p> <p>Even farms worth \u00a35m might in practice only pay inheritance tax of less than 1% a year, because they will be allowed to spread the cost over 10 years.</p> <p>Advani said only 44% of the individuals who gained agricultural relief had received any trading income from agriculture at any point in the five years prior to death. It is \u201cnot the classic working farmers\u201d who will bear the brunt of the changes, he argued. The change could help cool the rural property market because fewer people will buy a field as inheritance tax dodges, he added \u2013 although he did not expect the effect to be substantial.</p> <p>Instead, it may be the estates of some of the wealthiest people in Britain that are liable for inheritance tax. Those might include vacuum cleaner billionaire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/04/james-dyson-eu-common-agricultural-policy-subsidies\">James Dyson, who owns 14,600 hectares of British farmland</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/21/danish-billionaires-anders-and-anne-holch-povlsen-say-plan-is-to-restore-scottish-highlands\">Danish fashion investor Anders Holch Povlsen</a>, who reportedly owns more than 89,000 hectares of Scotland. Those estates may now be liable for hundreds of millions of pounds of inheritance tax, where previously they would have paid none. Neither Dyson nor Polvsen responded to requests for comment.</p> <p>Robert Palmer, executive director of Tax Justice UK, has long campaigned for changes to agricultural relief.</p> <p>\u201cI can understand why some farmers are nervous,\u201d Palmer said, \u201cbut the truth is that the vast majority of APR goes to the wealthiest families, many of which don\u2019t have much to do with farming.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand the wider context. The country is in a mess and public services need a lot more money.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, opposition parties rounded on the government, spotting an early opportunity to land a blow on Labour \u2013 not normally noted for its strong support in rural constituencies \u2013 after it won more than 100 rural MPs at the general election. Greg Smith, the Conservative MP for Mid-Buckinghamshire, told parliament that the budget was a \u201ca full-frontal financial attack on our farmers\u201d.</p> <p>Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, confirmed that his party would oppose the changes, telling reporters that it could affect about half of all farms.</p> <p>\u201cI think it shows a huge lack of understanding of rural communities and farmers, on a number of levels,\u201d he said. \u201cFarms tend to go down from generation to generation. That\u2019s how they kind of work, and it\u2019s really important for rural communities that they do.\u201d</p>    <p>But there has been little sign of nerves from rural Labour MPs so far. One who represents a predominantly rural constituency said they were unworried at the changes, arguing there had been \u201ca lot of inaccurate scaremongering\u201d and that the \u00a31m threshold would protect smaller family farms.</p> <p>\u201cThere was concern the agricultural relief would go entirely but, this is a demonstration of the voices of smaller farms being heard clearly by the Treasury as we now have so many Labour MPs representing farming and rural communities,\u201d they said.</p> <p>Whatever the size of the business, one thing is certain: tax advisers will have plenty of demand. Dunn said he had already seen companies advertising their inheritance tax planning services to farmers.</p> <p>\u201cBusinesses will have to really plan ahead and have succession plans in place,\u201d said Oliver, the farmer. \u201cIt\u2019s always the elephant in the room in farming.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "For Will Oliver, an arable farmer in Leicestershire, Labour\u2019s first budget in 14 years was a shock: despite the signals beforehand that inheritance tax was going to be a key source of tax revenue, his reaction was still one of disbelief. \u201cI didn\u2019t think they were going to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is big. It\u2019s massive.\u201d Agricultural property has been passed on to heirs tax-free for decades, but the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced on Wednesday that from April 2026 farms and other business property will fall within inheritance tax. Inheritors will have to pay 20% of the value of the agricultural and business property above \u00a31m, raising \u00a31.8bn by 2030 that can be used to improve public services. The announcement caused uproar among much of the farming sector, and opposition parties rounded on the government. Yet many tax experts and campaigners argue that for all the political backlash, the vast majority of family farms will still not pay a levy that is aimed at some of the wealthiest people in Britain. The National Farmers\u2019 Union complained that Labour had broken a promise not to tamper with agricultural property relief (APR). Victoria Vyvyan, president of the Country Land and Business Association, said it was a \u201cbetrayal\u201d. \u201cIf this is a government of growth and investment, they have failed the rural economy,\u201d she said, arguing that it would reduce investment in higher-productivity technologies on British farms. Jeremy Clarkson, the former Top Gear presenter turned celebrity farmer, also waded in. \u201cFarmers,\u201d Clarkson said on the X social network, \u201cI know that you have been shafted today. But please don\u2019t despair. Just look after yourselves for five short years and this shower will be gone.\u201d Yet Clarkson himself \u2013 or rather the prospective beneficiaries of his estate \u2013 may be among those \u201cshafted\u201d. Clarkson has previously said that he bought his 126-hectare (312-acre), \u00a34.25m farm, Diddly Squat, in order to avoid inheritance tax on his estate. In a 2021 interview with The Times Clarkson said that avoiding inheritance tax was \u201cthe critical thing\u201d in his decision to buy the farm. Assuming that \u2013 whatever the difficulties shown on the hit Clarkson\u2019s Farm TV series \u2013 the valuation of the farm has not fallen below the new \u00a31m threshold, it is likely that Clarkson\u2019s estate would now be liable for a significantly greater inheritance tax bill. Clarkson did not respond to a request for comment. Oliver, who is 35 with two children, spent the night after the budget in a maize field in a combine harvester. He argued that the tax would add an extra cost for farmers. If working farms had to find that money, \u201cfood prices are going to have to go up, surely\u201d, he said. \u201cI\u2019m a fourth-generation on the family farm, don\u2019t own the farm,\u201d he said. The farm is owned by his father. \u201cIf anything happened, God forbid, it could have a huge impact,\u201d he said. \u201cFarmers are struggling anyway, and this is going to be another cost for the business,\u201d he said, suggesting that some farming families would have to sell off fields to pay the inheritance tax bills. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take long before there\u2019s not much farm left.\u201d George Dunn, the chief executive of the Tenant Farmers\u2019 Association, argued that some of his members could also be affected indirectly if large estates sold up to pay inheritance tax bills. \u201cWe are fearful that we will see a bit of a kneejerk reaction from estates,\u201d he said. \u201cTenants might find themselves unseated from their farms.\u201d Yet tax experts question whether the archetypal \u201cfamily farm\u201d will truly be affected. Pre-budget analysis by the Centre for the Analysis of Taxation (CenTax) suggested that only 200 estates out of 1,300 a year between 2018 and 2020 claimed more than \u00a31m in relief each year. Those 200 estates \u2013 by definition among the wealthiest in Britain \u2013 reaped 64% of all the agricultural relief. The updated relief can in fact be even more generous for true family farms than the \u00a31m headline. A married couple owning a farm together can split it in two, meaning it qualifies for \u00a32m of agricultural property relief, plus another \u00a3500,000 for each partner if a property is involved. That means a farm worth \u00a33m might pay zero inheritance tax, said Arun Advani, associate professor of economics at the University of Warwick and a director of CenTax. Even farms worth \u00a35m might in practice only pay inheritance tax of less than 1% a year, because they will be allowed to spread the cost over 10 years. Advani said only 44% of the individuals who gained agricultural relief had received any trading income from agriculture at any point in the five years prior to death. It is \u201cnot the classic working farmers\u201d who will bear the brunt of the changes, he argued. The change could help cool the rural property market because fewer people will buy a field as inheritance tax dodges, he added \u2013 although he did not expect the effect to be substantial. Instead, it may be the estates of some of the wealthiest people in Britain that are liable for inheritance tax. Those might include vacuum cleaner billionaire James Dyson, who owns 14,600 hectares of British farmland, and Danish fashion investor Anders Holch Povlsen, who reportedly owns more than 89,000 hectares of Scotland. Those estates may now be liable for hundreds of millions of pounds of inheritance tax, where previously they would have paid none. Neither Dyson nor Polvsen responded to requests for comment. Robert Palmer, executive director of Tax Justice UK, has long campaigned for changes to agricultural relief. \u201cI can understand why some farmers are nervous,\u201d Palmer said, \u201cbut the truth is that the vast majority of APR goes to the wealthiest families, many of which don\u2019t have much to do with farming. \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand the wider context. The country is in a mess and public services need a lot more money.\u201d Nevertheless, opposition parties rounded on the government, spotting an early opportunity to land a blow on Labour \u2013 not normally noted for its strong support in rural constituencies \u2013 after it won more than 100 rural MPs at the general election. Greg Smith, the Conservative MP for Mid-Buckinghamshire, told parliament that the budget was a \u201ca full-frontal financial attack on our farmers\u201d. Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, confirmed that his party would oppose the changes, telling reporters that it could affect about half of all farms. \u201cI think it shows a huge lack of understanding of rural communities and farmers, on a number of levels,\u201d he said. \u201cFarms tend to go down from generation to generation. That\u2019s how they kind of work, and it\u2019s really important for rural communities that they do.\u201d But there has been little sign of nerves from rural Labour MPs so far. One who represents a predominantly rural constituency said they were unworried at the changes, arguing there had been \u201ca lot of inaccurate scaremongering\u201d and that the \u00a31m threshold would protect smaller family farms. \u201cThere was concern the agricultural relief would go entirely but, this is a demonstration of the voices of smaller farms being heard clearly by the Treasury as we now have so many Labour MPs representing farming and rural communities,\u201d they said. Whatever the size of the business, one thing is certain: tax advisers will have plenty of demand. Dunn said he had already seen companies advertising their inheritance tax planning services to farmers. \u201cBusinesses will have to really plan ahead and have succession plans in place,\u201d said Oliver, the farmer. \u201cIt\u2019s always the elephant in the room in farming.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A brief survey of my one-year-old\u2019s bookshelf reveals a plethora of&nbsp;books about animals: crocodiles, cows, sheep and rabbits (so&nbsp;many rabbits). In truth these creatures are humans in disguise, or at&nbsp;least they embody qualities that are distinctly human; it is purely in their surface \u2013 their fur or scales or hair \u2013 that they resemble animals. As John&nbsp;Berger <a href=\"https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~cavitch/pdf-library/Berger_LookAnimals.pdf\">wrote</a> back in 1980, they are but \u201chuman puppets\u201d, creatures whom we ventriloquise. Like animals in zoos, or large mice inhabited by underpaid and hot theme-park workers, they represent not our proximity, but our estrangement from&nbsp;what Berger calls \u201cthe first circle of&nbsp;what surrounded man\u201d, that is animals. Talk about ruining a&nbsp;bedtime&nbsp;story, John.</p> <p>The cover and endpapers of Chloe&nbsp;Dalton\u2019s debut, Raising Hare (beautifully illustrated by <a href=\"https://denisenestorillustration.com/\">Denise Nestor</a>) at first seem to resemble these children\u2019s books: there are no rabbits, but hares, doing what hares do: inspecting berries, leaping, boxing, feeding young and gazing outward, apparently, towards the reader. The story of this excellent book is in one sense familiar: a narrator, experiencing a rupture or crisis, is transformed through a magical encounter with a&nbsp;\u201cwild\u201d creature, a hare. But there is much more going on here. As hare and&nbsp;narrator enter into conversation, their strange dialogue begins to shed light on our relationship with our non-human neighbours, bringing into question assumptions about control, consent, boundaries and autonomy. Unlike my daughter\u2019s books, this is a&nbsp;sustained and patient attempt to cross the species abyss, and to see the&nbsp;world&nbsp;through the hare\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>The setting is Dalton\u2019s home, a&nbsp;restored stone barn situated somewhere in the English countryside (as with so much in this book, there is a deliberate elision of personal detail and we do not know exactly where). During the pandemic she retreated here from London, distancing herself from her work in the city as a well-connected political adviser (the book\u2019s acknowledgments feature William Hague and Angelina Jolie). For all that the she lionises her work (she writes, with little irony, that she would risk death for her political masters), she is conscious of its costs: severed relationships, deracination and hyper-vigilance. Dalton relishes the high-status tightrope, but is not too sure where the exit points are.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Dalton has a zoologist\u2019s eye for detail and a poet\u2019s sensitivity to language </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Enter the leveret, a baby hare, magical interloper and harbinger of transformation. She finds the creature lying on a country track outside her&nbsp;home, seemingly abandoned. \u201cIts&nbsp;forepaws were pressed tightly together, fringed in fur the colour of&nbsp;bone and overlapping as if for comfort.\u201d From the outset, Dalton is conflicted about whether to rescue the&nbsp;hare and take her into her home. She relents, though she places certain restrictions on their relationship: she does not name the animal, tries not to touch it, and does not, except briefly, confine it (it can leave the house through a specially constructed flap). Over the course of the book they develop a remarkable relationship with&nbsp;its own language; not, of course, a&nbsp;human language, but one of gestures, movements and exhalations (hares, we&nbsp;learn, emit soft, puff-like sounds). Dalton has a zoologist\u2019s eye for detail and a poet\u2019s sensitivity to language; she conjures the beauty, the allure and variation of the hare\u2019s sounds, mouth, eyes and fur, which changes with the seasons and marks the passage of time. Her language is shot with such intense tenderness and emotion that sometimes I paused, put down my pencil and asked myself: what are we <em>actually</em> talking about here? Are we talking about a hare? Yet the challenge of this book, or rather its invitation, is to temper parental assumptions and take Dalton\u2019s language as it comes; to imagine and appreciate both that a leveret is not a child, and its care can be as intense and meaningful as care for a child.</p> <p>It was the author Michael Pollan who asked, of our relationship with plants: who is domesticating whom? It\u2019s a question that\u2019s relevant here. The hare is clearly altered: she takes powdered milk, munches coriander and enters and leaves a human <em>domus</em>, deriving both protection and companionship. So too Dalton, this busy professional who hare-proofs her home, sacrifices her garden plants, discovers a sense of&nbsp;connection to the local landscape and reevaluates her past. Theirs is a&nbsp;mutual dance, one without a leader, and indeed it\u2019s hard not to draw contrasts with the working culture of&nbsp;the place in which Dalton forged her&nbsp;career, Westminster. There is very little irony in this book; it possesses a dream-like quality, and often reads as a fable of metamorphosis. It is full of binaries: city v country; tame v wild; frenetic v still; before v after hare; binaries that are seductive and alluring but which perhaps reflect our own desires more than the messy realities of the Anthropocene (or indeed the painful and drawn-out process of personal change). \u201c[Affection for an animal] has an innocence and purity of its own,\u201d Dalton writes in a finely crafted section of the book that betrays her training as a speechwriter. But is this true? All relationships, whether human or non-human, contain darkness. Even relationships of care have their own shadow, yet in this tale darkness is an external, almost archetypal, force; the machine, the city, work, the past.</p> <p>Each year there appear new books&nbsp;which fuse stories of personal transformation and non-human encounters whether with whales, octopuses, birds and such like. What would Berger have made of these stories \u2013 and our appetite for them? I&nbsp;think he might have critiqued the ease with which they flourish within those market systems which he excoriated for marginalising animals in the first place. But maybe he would have appreciated this book\u2019s urge to restore a sense of the sacred, to meet animals on their own terms, and rewild the human imagination.</p> <p>\u2022 Raising Hare by Chloe Dalton is published by Canongate (\u00a318.99).

Like animals in zoos, or large mice inhabited by underpaid and hot theme-park workers, they represent not our proximity, but our estrangement from what Berger calls \u201cthe first circle of what surrounded man\u201d, that is animals. Talk about ruining a bedtime story, John. The cover and endpapers of Chloe Dalton\u2019s debut, Raising Hare (beautifully illustrated by Denise Nestor) at first seem to resemble these children\u2019s books: there are no rabbits, but hares, doing what hares do: inspecting berries, leaping, boxing, feeding young and gazing outward, apparently, towards the reader. The story of this excellent book is in one sense familiar: a narrator, experiencing a rupture or crisis, is transformed through a magical encounter with a \u201cwild\u201d creature, a hare. But there is much more going on here. As hare and narrator enter into conversation, their strange dialogue begins to shed light on our relationship with our non-human neighbours, bringing into question assumptions about control, consent, boundaries and autonomy. Unlike my daughter\u2019s books, this is a sustained and patient attempt to cross the species abyss, and to see the world through the hare\u2019s eyes. The setting is Dalton\u2019s home, a restored stone barn situated somewhere in the English countryside (as with so much in this book, there is a deliberate elision of personal detail and we do not know exactly where). During the pandemic she retreated here from London, distancing herself from her work in the city as a well-connected political adviser (the book\u2019s acknowledgments feature William Hague and Angelina Jolie). For all that the she lionises her work (she writes, with little irony, that she would risk death for her political masters), she is conscious of its costs: severed relationships, deracination and hyper-vigilance. Dalton relishes the high-status tightrope, but is not too sure where the exit points are. Enter the leveret, a baby hare, magical interloper and harbinger of transformation. She finds the creature lying on a country track outside her home, seemingly abandoned. \u201cIts forepaws were pressed tightly together, fringed in fur the colour of bone and overlapping as if for comfort.\u201d From the outset, Dalton is conflicted about whether to rescue the hare and take her into her home. She relents, though she places certain restrictions on their relationship: she does not name the animal, tries not to touch it, and does not, except briefly, confine it (it can leave the house through a specially constructed flap). Over the course of the book they develop a remarkable relationship with its own language; not, of course, a human language, but one of gestures, movements and exhalations (hares, we learn, emit soft, puff-like sounds). Dalton has a zoologist\u2019s eye for detail and a poet\u2019s sensitivity to language; she conjures the beauty, the allure and variation of the hare\u2019s sounds, mouth, eyes and fur, which changes with the seasons and marks the passage of time. Her language is shot with such intense tenderness and emotion that sometimes I paused, put down my pencil and asked myself: what are we actually talking about here? Are we talking about a hare? Yet the challenge of this book, or rather its invitation, is to temper parental assumptions and take Dalton\u2019s language as it comes; to imagine and appreciate both that a leveret is not a child, and its care can be as intense and meaningful as care for a child. It was the author Michael Pollan who asked, of our relationship with plants: who is domesticating whom? It\u2019s a question that\u2019s relevant here. The hare is clearly altered: she takes powdered milk, munches coriander and enters and leaves a human domus, deriving both protection and companionship. So too Dalton, this busy professional who hare-proofs her home, sacrifices her garden plants, discovers a sense of connection to the local landscape and reevaluates her past. Theirs is a mutual dance, one without a leader, and indeed it\u2019s hard not to draw contrasts with the working culture of the place in which Dalton forged her career, Westminster. There is very little irony in this book; it possesses a dream-like quality, and often reads as a fable of metamorphosis. It is full of binaries: city v country; tame v wild; frenetic v still; before v after hare; binaries that are seductive and alluring but which perhaps reflect our own desires more than the messy realities of the Anthropocene (or indeed the painful and drawn-out process of personal change). \u201c[Affection for an animal] has an innocence and purity of its own,\u201d Dalton writes in a finely crafted section of the book that betrays her training as a speechwriter. But is this true? All relationships, whether human or non-human, contain darkness. Even relationships of care have their own shadow, yet in this tale darkness is an external, almost archetypal, force; the machine, the city, work, the past. Each year there appear new books which fuse stories of personal transformation and non-human encounters whether with whales, octopuses, birds and such like. What would Berger have made of these stories \u2013 and our appetite for them? I think he might have critiqued the ease with which they flourish within those market systems which he excoriated for marginalising animals in the first place. But maybe he would have appreciated this book\u2019s urge to restore a sense of the sacred, to meet animals on their own terms, and rewild the human imagination. \u2022 Raising Hare by Chloe Dalton is published by Canongate (\u00a318.99).

      "bodyText": "The three producers suing Rebel Wilson for defamation have requested a 90-day stay in the Los Angeles superior court to establish the source of an anonymous website that they say accuses one of them of being an \u201cIndian Ghislaine Maxwell\u201d. Defamation proceedings against Wilson, 44, were launched in July, after the Australian actor made claims to her 11 million Instagram followers that the producers of her film The Deb had engaged in theft, bullying and sexual misconduct. The producers allege in court documents that Wilson fabricated \u201cfalse and malicious lies\u201d on Instagram in retribution for the producers\u2019 refusal to grant her writing and music credits. Lawyers acting for Amanda Ghost, Gregor Cameron and Vince Holden lodged documents on Tuesday alleging that shortly after they initiated the defamation action Wilson sent them a series of emails threatening to \u201cvery publicly ruin them\u201d, including one on 29 July warning she was poised for \u201cgoing public\u201d. Two days later an anonymous website was registered, the producers\u2019 lawyers say, where \u201cgrotesque lies\u201d were made, including allegations that Ghost, who is of Indo\u2013Trinidadian heritage, was the \u201cIndian Ghislaine Maxwell\u201d. \u201cFailing in music she turned full pimp, reinventing herself as a theatrical producer alongside her husband [co-producer of The Deb, Gregor Cameron] while really procuring young women for the pleasure of the extremely wealthy,\u201d the website alleged. In October, Wilson launched a countersuit against her producers, repeating in her cross-complaint many of the allegations she had initially made on Instagram. Last week she filed a motion to strike the defamation claims against her, under California\u2019s anti-Slapp laws, designed to protect freedom of speech on matters of public interest. The anti-Slapp case is due to be heard on 21 November, but on Tuesday lawyers acting for the producers moved to delay the hearing. They lodged a motion for 90 days leave to take targeted discovery, with the source of the anonymous website at the core of their ongoing investigations. There was \u201cample reason to believe that discovery will yield further evidence that Wilson has aggressively spread such rumours about the plaintiffs\u201d, the motion says, thereby proving \u201can inference of actual malice\u201d which would strike Wilson\u2019s anti-Slapp motion. Since Wilson\u2019s original Instagram post in early July, in which she expressed fear her debut film as director would \u201cget buried\u201d because of her producers\u2019 alleged behaviour (the film subsequently premiered at the Toronto film festival), the accusations and counter-accusations have become increasingly acrimonious. The producers allege the relationship with Wilson began to deteriorate when she used bullying and extortion to \u201cget credit and payment for work she did not do, and to overshadow young, upcoming artists who truly deserved the credit\u201d. The script for The Deb was the end product of a Rebel Wilson Theatremakers Scholarship, administered through the Australian Theatre for Young People. It was won by Hannah Reilly, who is credited as the writer of the film. The producers also claim Wilson attempted to gain credit as a writer of the film\u2019s music, which is attributed to Meg Washington. The dispute over copyright was eventually taken to the Australian Writers\u2019 Guild for arbitration, which found in Reilly and the producers\u2019 favour. An AWG spokesperson told the Guardian the guild did not comment on individual arbitrations. \u201cThe Australian Writers\u2019 Guild administers binding credit arbitration on behalf of its members to ensure fairness and transparency in the allocation of writers\u2019 credits,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding this arbitration was accepted by guilds and the industry in general internationally. \u201cFor years, Rebel has played the affable funny girl on the big screen and, off screen, portrayed herself as the champion of other female artists and whistleblower against abusive conduct within the film industry,\u201d the producers\u2019 defamation case claims. \u201cThis public persona, however, is a farce. Rebel is a bully who will disregard the interests of others to promote her own.\u201d The claim also alleges Wilson fabricated allegations of inappropriate behaviour against her Grimsby co-star Sacha Baron Cohen to promote the sale of her memoir Rebel Rising, published earlier this year. \u201cRebel has run this playbook one time too many,\u201d the claim states. In her cross-complaint, Wilson alleges the three producers undermined The Deb by \u201cengaging in reprehensible and unlawful conduct\u201d, which included Ghost sexually harassing the lead actress, Charlotte MacInnes, causing the 24-year-old to have a breakdown. Wilson claims that after complaints over Ghost\u2019s alleged misconduct reached her husband, co-producer Cameron, he allegedly unlawfully imprisoned her and two local Australian producers by confining them to a small room and refusing to allow them to leave until she withdrew her complaint against his wife. Cameron denies these claims. MacInnes has since released a public statement saying there was \u201cno truth\u201d to Wilson\u2019s allegations and she refused to \u201cbe the subject of a fabricated narrative\u201d. Wilson also accused her producers of \u201cscheming to embezzle\u201d A$900,000 from the film\u2019s budget, and \u201ccontinuously bullying and harassing\u201d her to sign documents under duress \u2013 claims that the producers deny. High-profile California entertainment lawyers have now been engaged on both sides. Ghost, Cameron and Holden have hired the LA celebrity lawyer Camille Vasquez, who successfully represented Johnny Depp in the defamation action he brought against his wife Amber Heard. Vasquez has also represented Hollywood A-listers Ben Affleck, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lopez. Wilson has engaged a Beverly Hills entertainment legal firm led by Bryan Freedman, who represented the Michael Jackson estate in a lawsuit against HBO over allegations of child sexual abuse made in the 2019 documentary Leaving Neverland.",

Australian share market has biggest weekly fall since August The Australian share market has suffered its worst week in three months, falling for a third straight session after global equities sank. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index finished Friday down 41.2 points, or 0.5%, at 8,118.8 for its lowest close in seven weeks. For the week, the index was 1.13% lower. The share market has not fallen by as much in the space of a week since August. The broader All Ordinaries fell 42.4 points, or 0.5%, to 8,379.7. \u2013 AAP Record home loan size comes despite drop in value of new lending We have a bit more on the home loan data out from the ABS today. Despite the drop in the value of new lending, the average national owner-occupier loan size hit a new record high in September to $642,121 (original data), up $43,254 from the year before. New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland were the only states to record an increase to the average loan size, with Queensland\u2019s average new loan size hitting a record high of $619,599 (original data) with a sizeable $15,611 increase - the highest increase in dollar terms since November 2021. First home buyers fell out of the market with the value of new loans dropping by 3.3% to $5.21bn. However, compared to a year ago, new lending is up by 8.8%, or $421.4m. Data insights director at Canstar, Sally Tindall, said: This drop in new lending is evidence that after 13 RBA rises, and almost 12 months with a cash rate at 4.35%, borrowers may have now reached their limit. It\u2019s astonishing to think the average owner-occupier loan is now over $642,000. On a 30-year mortgage at the average new customer rate, that\u2019s a monthly repayment of almost $4,000. No wonder buyers are starting to tap out. While the proportion of new borrowers opting for a fixed rate is still incredibly low, this data will be worth watching in the months ahead to see if the deluge of fixed cuts gets borrowers locking in their rate. National average home loan size hits record high, ABS lending data shows The ABS lending data came out earlier today, showing the national average home loan size has hit a record high of $642,121. While the value of investor home loans went down 1% in September to $11.6bn dollars, it is sitting nearly 30% higher than one year ago, and just slightly off the record high in January 2022. In comparison, owner-occupier loans went up 1% to $18.6m, which is 13.1% in the year. NSW police appeal for information on man\u2019s death near Kyogle in October 2021 NSW detectives are appealing for information as an investigation continues into the death of a man near Kyogle in 2021. In a statement, NSW police said: About 12.40am on Sunday 17 October 2021, emergency services attended a property on Gonpa Road, Collins Creek, following reports a man had collapsed. NSW Ambulance paramedics assisted the 46-year-old man at the scene; however, he could not be revived. Officers attached to Richmond Police District attended and commenced inquiries into the man\u2019s death. A report was prepared for the Coroner, and a Coronial Inquiry was established; however, the Inquiry was suspended and the matter has since been referred to the Office of The Director of Public Prosecutions. As part of ongoing inquiries, Casino Detectives executed a crime scene warrant at the Collins Creek property about 9.45am yesterday (Thursday 31 October 2024). Truth-telling inquiry chair says \u2018there\u2019s been no contact\u2019 from new premier Crisafulli Joshua Creamer said on Friday the process had been \u201chugely disrespectful\u201d and would cause \u201ca significant amount of devastation across the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island community. \u201cThere is a lot of suffering, a lot of pain, a lot of hurt in relation to this decision,\u201d he said. \u201cI appreciate the premier has said that his actions will be decent and respectful, but leading up to the [press conference] there was no contact between the premier and my office or myself. \u201cEven to this very moment, and I\u2019ve asked the team to be continuing to be checking emails, there\u2019s been no contact.\u201d Creamer said he had sought legal advice and had now halted the work of the inquiry. It had been preparing to hear from 40 identified witnesses from the Indigenous community of Cherbourg. \u201cTo have to stop this process is going to cause \u2026 a real impact on those people emotionally,\u201d he said. Creamer said it was unprecedented for a government to demand that an independent inquiry halt its work. Queensland LNP\u2019s moves to end truth-telling process \u2018hugely disrespectful\u2019, chair says The chair of Queensland\u2019s First Nations Truth Telling and Healing Inquiry, Joshua Creamer, says the new state government\u2019s moves to end the process have been \u201chugely disrespectful\u201d to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. Creamer, a Waanyi and Kalkadoon man, told reporters on Friday he heard secondhand that the new premier, David Crisafulli, had told a press conference the inquiry should cease work. The LNP had said it would end the state\u2019s \u201cpath to Treaty\u201d process, of which the truth-telling inquiry is the first step. Crisafulli has said the process would be ended with \u201crespect and decency\u201d. (continued in next post) Last month was Australia\u2019s second-hottest October, BoM says Just days after the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO reminded us that Australia had heated up 1.5C since 1910 in their biennial state of the climate report, we have another reminder of our warming trend. Last month, mean temperatures were 2.51C warmer than the 1961-90 average, making it the second-warmest October on record, BoM says. For Queensland, it was the warmest, up 2.77C. For maximum temperatures, last month was the fourth-warmest October on average, with daytime temperatures 2.81C above the norm. For minimums, it was also the second-warmest October on record, with overnight temperatures 2.21C above that 1961-90 yardstick. For rain, the national area-averaged October tally was 18.4% below the 1961-1990 average. Only Western Australia was wetter than average, with all others states and territories drier than average last month. \u201cRainfall was below to very much below average (in the lowest 10% of all Octobers since 1900) for south-western Western Australia, and parts of New South Wales and Victoria,\u201d the BoM said. \u201cFor both Victoria and Tasmania area-averaged rainfall was the lowest since 2019, around 30% below the October average.\u201d A 35-year-old Perth man has died after being arrested and taken to Perth watch house. In a statement, WA police said: About 2pm on Thursday 31 October 2024, officers from Midland Police arrested a 35-year-old man \u2013 who was on bail for serious charges \u2013 for breaching bail conditions. He was subsequently taken to the Perth Watch House where he was assessed by a nurse on admittance, police said in a statement. About 8pm, a change in his behaviour was noticed and following consultation with nursing staff, a decision was made to convey the man to Royal Perth Hospital for further assessment. Tragically he suffered a medical episode while still in police presence prior to being admitted. Despite the best efforts of Emergency Department staff, the man could not be revived. The death is not being treated as suspicious and a report will be prepared for the Coroner. New documents reveal PwC International leaders threatened their Australian counterparts with expulsion from the network unless they handed over ultimate control of the consultancy firm\u2019s response to the damaging tax leaks scandal. In May 2023, PwC International\u2019s global general counsel, Diana Weiss, wrote to the Australian executive warning its response to the scandal had \u201ccaused a breakdown of trust and confidence in the firm and significant damage to PwC\u2019s reputation\u201d. The scathing letter outlines how deeply unhappy the global executive was with the Australian firm. The letter, published by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services on Friday, includes: A series of public hearings and disclosures have shed light on the firm\u2019s involvement in consulting engagements that have been beset by poor risk management practices, evidenced gaps in professional judgment and exposed the firm to further public scrutiny and criticism. The firm made public statements that improperly downplayed the severity of the \u2026 matter and minimized the significance of the underlying behaviours, which have given rise to significant adverse media, both domestically and globally. The global firm demanded PwC Australia hand over ultimate control of its communications with regulators and ongoing investigations. PwC Australia accepted the conditions. The chair of the inquiry, Labor senator Deborah O\u2019Neill, said in a statement: Australians deserve to know who is actually running the large consulting, audit and accounting firms which are so deeply enmeshed with not just our government, but our financial markets and collective economic security. Details of PwC\u2019s misconduct, and the steps taken by PwC International to firewall itself from the Australian firm and protect its global reputation, are of significant public interest. And with that I will leave the blog with Cait Kelly. Thanks for reading. Costs rising faster than revenues in private hospital sector, report shows The Health Check assessed private hospital financial data for the period 2017\u201318 to 2023\u201324. Its analysis found private hospital\u2019s expenditures were increasing at a growth rate of 4.1% while revenues were falling behind at a growth rate of only 2.9% between 2018-19 to 2021-22. Those figures were based on assessing the National Hospital Cost Data Collection and Private Hospital Data Bureau, which represent 89 overnight hospitals, representing 38% of private hospital discharges and 50% of private hospital revenue in 2022\u201323. For private hospitals that submitted financial data to the Health Check, there was a decline in the weighted average earnings before interest, tax and depreciation (EBITDA) margins from 8.7% in 2018-19 to 4.4% in 2022-23. Financial data was voluntarily provided by 243 out of 647 hospitals, representing 58% of private hospital discharges and 63% of hospital revenue in 2022\u201323. The report acknowledged its potential selection bias due to the incomplete submission of financial data across the private hospital sector. Taking into account other publicly available financial data, the department estimates that the sector\u2019s weighted average EBITDA margin is likely to have been between 7% and 8% in 2022-23. \u2018Private Hospital Sector Financial Health Check\u2019 shows maternity and mental health services are areas of concern Maternity and mental health services within private hospitals are \u201cincreasingly difficult to offer\u201d, a government review of the sector\u2019s financial viability has highlighted as particular areas of concern amid an overall reduction in profitability. The government has published a summary of its \u2018Private Hospital Sector Financial Health Check\u2019, which is the most we\u2019ll be able to learn about its analysis because the report in full can\u2019t be shared due to commercial in confidence information. The stoush between private hospitals and insurers prompted the federal health department to ask hospitals and other stakeholders to hand over their financial information to assess the performance, pressures and profitability of the sector. In a statement made on releasing the summary, the health minister, Mark Butler, said while parts of the sector have remained strong, there has been a reduction in profitability over time as costs have risen faster than revenue. \u201cThis shows that there is substantial work for private health insurers and private hospitals to do to ensure the sector\u2019s long-term viability.\u201d Butler said he was \u201cgrateful to all those who participated in the health check as we all work towards a strong and sustainable future for private hospitals in Australia\u201d. There will be no silver bullet from Canberra or funding solution from taxpayers to deal with what are essentially private pressures in this system. The government will work in partnership the private health sector to develop innovative solutions which meet the needs of the sector and the Australian people. \u2018Jobseekers and businesses have waited long enough\u2019 for employment service reform, says CPSU secretary Melissa Donnelly, CPSU national secretary, said: The public service is well placed to prioritise the needs of parents and carers who participate in this program, by offering tailored support to help them achieve their personal and work goals. For too long Australians have been let down by a privatised system that is more concerned with banking big profits for tax dodging multinationals, than it is with delivering high quality employment services in local communities. We must not lose sight of the urgency of this reform. Jobseekers and businesses have waited long enough for an effective employment service. The CPSU looks forward to the successful implementation of this pilot and the valuable insights it will provide for future employment service reforms. First publicly run employment service pilot launches in South Australia The first employment service pilot run by the public service has launched today in South Australia. It comes after a parliamentary review ordered by the Albanese government last year showed the decades-long privatisation of employment services was failing people now welfare. Guardian Australia has revealed job providers are being paid millions of dollars in public money for work that jobseekers are finding themselves, are routinely harassing and suspending jobseekers for payslip details so they can get public funding and are claiming millions of dollars each year in false claims. The privatised system, which is expected to cost taxpayers almost $10bn over the four years, is the single biggest commonwealth procurement outside Defence. The Parent Pathways pilot is designed to be voluntary, tailored to the needs of parents and carers, and run by the APS. Rather than being geared toward delivering profits for multinational businesses, the Parent Pathways program will be focused on ensuring that parents and carers who aren\u2019t in paid employment have the support they need for their personal, study or work goals. It is voluntary, tailored to the needs of parents and carers, and run by the APS. The service will be available to parents and carers in Playford and the surrounding areas near Adelaide. The CPSU, which has long advocated for the end of for-profit employment services, said it represents \u201ca new direction\u201d. In opposition, Crisafulli repeatedly committed to automatically appoint his shadow ministry to the frontbench if elected to government. On 23 October, just three days before the election, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve said that many times \u2013 the cabinet, the shadow cabinet I\u2019m taking to the election, will be the cabinet after the election if we\u2019re elected to government. And it\u2019s important that Queenslanders know that there\u2019s great stability.\u201d But Crisafulli has appointed Christian Rowan as leader of the house, booting him from the frontbench. Ros Bates has lost the health portfolio. His new cabinet is: David Crisafulli: premier, minister for veterans Jarrod Bleijie: deputy premier, minister for state development, infrastructure and planning, and minister for industrial relations David Janetzki: treasurer, minister for energy, and minister for home ownership Ros Bates: minister for finance, trade, employment and training Dale Last: minister for natural resources and mines, minister for manufacturing and minister for regional and rural development Tim Nicholls: minister for health and ambulance services Deb Frecklington: attorney general, minister for justice and minister for integrity John-Paul Langbroek: minister for education and the arts Dan Purdie: minister for police and emergency services Laura Gerber: minister for youth justice and victim support and minister for corrective services Brent Mickelberg: minister for transport and main roads Ann Leahy: minister for local government and water and minister for fire, disaster recovery and volunteers Sam O\u2019Connor: minister for housing and public works and minister for youth Tony Perrett: minister for primary industries Fiona Simpson: minister for women and women\u2019s economic security, minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships and minister for multiculturalism Andrew Powell: minister for the environment and tourism and minister for science and innovation Amanda Camm: minister for families, seniors and disability services and minister for child safety and the prevention of domestic and family violence Tim Mander: minister for sport and racing and minister for the Olympic and Paralympic Games Steve Minnikin: minister for customer services and open data and minister for small and family business PwC Australia sacked eight staff last financial year due to their involvement in undisclosed data breaches. The sacked staff include two partners, one director, two senior managers, one manager, one senior associate, and one associate. The staff are not named. The firm has outlined the nature of misconduct in response to questions from Greens senator Barbara Pocock: 1. The exporting or inappropriate access, copying, printing or disclosure of documents. 2. The sending of client or PwC-related information to personal email addresses. None of the sacked staff were registered tax advisers, which meant professional accounting bodies were not informed. Another three people were sacked by PwC Australia last financial year, taking the total to 11. Queensland cabinet to be sworn in at midday Queensland time Jarrod Bleijie just arrived at government house in Brisbane, and other soon-to-be ministers are expected to follow. They will be sworn in at midday. Crisafulli cabinet a mix of Newman ex-ministers and first timers David Crisafulli\u2019s shadow cabinet included three former leaders of the LNP \u2013 John-Paul Langbroek, Deb Frecklington and Tim Nicholls \u2013 and several former deputy leaders. Most of the government has never held a ministry before, because the party has barely been in government in decades. Its last leader to win a second term in office was Joh Bjelke-Petersen in 1986. For example, after 32 years in Queensland parliament, Fiona Simpson is expected to get her first cabinet posting. She was speaker of the house in the party\u2019s last term of government, under Campbell Newman, and has never before had any ministerial responsibility. Crisafulli has only served in one ministry: local government, also under Newman. The deputy premier, Jarrod Bleijie, was Newman\u2019s high-profile attorney general. There is only one member of government who has served in any other cabinet: then senator Amanda Stoker. She served as Scott Morrison\u2019s assistant minister to the attorney general from 2020 until 2022, and was also assistant minister for industrial relations and assistant minister for women. It\u2019s yet to be seen if she will win a ministry again. Ros Bates was Newman\u2019s minister for science, IT, innovation and the arts before being sacked over a scandal after 318 days. Tim Nicholls was treasurer under Newman, responsible for budgets which slashed about 14,000 jobs from the public service and planned privatisation of $37bn in state assets. Tim Mander, Langbroek, Rob Molhoek and Andrew Powell also served as ministers or assistant ministers under Newman. David Crisafulli to announce new Queensland cabinet today New Queensland premier David Crisafulli is set to announce his cabinet tday. They will be sworn in by governor Jeannette Young today ahead of a press conference at government house. In opposition the LNP leader said he\u2019d appoint all his shadow ministers to their portfolios in government. But he\u2019s expected to break the promise, in order to bring in some new blood and to diversify the ministry. \u201cThe people who you have seen and who have done a really good job will be the people who you see and will be rewarded,\u201d he said, on Monday. NSW police unsure of technical issues that led to death of two dogs in police vehicles overnight NSW Police say a \u201ctechnical issue\u201d, not human error, led to the deaths of two dogs overnight. Police dog Xtra and development dog Soldier were found dead within an air-conditioned pod inside a purpose-built police vehicle overnight. NSW assistant police commissioner Stephen Hegarty told reporters earlier the air conditioned pods were \u201ctop of the range\u201d and that police are still unsure exactly what happened: The air conditioner cools the pod on the rear of vehicles. So it is modified for that exact reason. It is top of the range stuff that was introduced back in 2023. So, we have really good equipment. We don\u2019t understand why that\u2019s taken place. It is normal procedure that we can actually put the dogs in the pod. A primary cooling source would be the air conditioner. Unfortunately, when we returned to the motor vehicle, it had ceased, which obviously makes that air conditioner cease as well. The dogs can be in the rear of a car at night-time for long, long periods of time. So it is not unusual and nowhere near against any processes or training that we\u2019ve given the officers. NSW Health issues warning on high-dose skull-shaped MDMA tablets NSW Health has warned of multiple high-dose MDMA tablets currently in circulation in NSW. Described as skull-shaped with \u201cMYBRAND\u201d wording and logo imprinted on the reverse side, in blue, yellow, or pink-orange in colour, the pills are found to contain a higher dose than is usually expected. Some of the tablets have also been found to contain dipentylone, a synthetic cathinone with stimulant effects. In a statement, NSW Health said that the risk of harm is \u201cincreased when MDMA is taken with other stimulants including synthetic cathinones, amphetamines or cocaine\u201d. Medical director of the NSW Poisons Information Centre, Dr Darren Roberts, said consuming high doses of MDMA has been linked to cases of serious illness and death. MDMA can cause severe agitation, raised body temperature, seizures or fits, irregular heart rhythm and death. The amount of MDMA in a tablet or capsule can vary significantly, even within the same batch. The health risks from MDMA are greatly increased if high amounts (including multiple doses) are consumed over a short period. Pauline Hanson has responded to the federal court finding against her by saying she is \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d and will be appealing. Earlier today, Justice Angus Stewart found that Hanson had racially vilified Greens Senator Mehreen Faruqi by telling her to \u201cpiss off back to Pakistan\u201d. Hanson took to X to say the outcome \u201cdemonstrates the inappropriately broad application of section 18C\u201d. Senator Hanson is deeply disappointed by today\u2019s federal court judgment. The outcome demonstrates the inappropriately broad application of section 18C, particularly in so far as it impinges upon freedom of political expression. Given the importance of this matter, Senator Hanson has instructed her lawyers to prepare and lodge appeal documents. She will not make further comment as the matter is before the court. Man, 63, arrested after allegedly performing Nazi salute at Melbourne protest A man who allegedly performed a Nazi salute during a violent protest outside a controversial weapons exhibition has been arrested following an investigation. Violent confrontations between anti-war protesters and police broke outside the Land Forces 2024 exhibition in Melbourne over three days in September. At the time numerous arrests were made and police circulated photos of those they were keen on speaking to after numerous officers and protesters were injured. Wheelie bins were set alight and horse manure, food-grade acid and glass bottles were hurdled at police barricades. On Friday, police said another 12 people had been arrested since the protest on 11 September, which is in addition to the 89 people charged or fined on the day. Among those a 30-year-old Preston man will face court after he allegedly pushed crates against police horses. A 63-year-old Crib Point man will be charged on summons for allegedly performing the Nazi salute in a public place on 11 September. Police say that during the protests outside the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre there were rocks, projectiles, liquid which smelt strongly of vomit, horse manure, eggs and liquid irritants hurled at police officers, horses and expo attendees. Several police horses and riders were also allegedly splashed with a liquid irritant \u2013 including being sprayed under face protectors, going into their mouths and nostrils \u2013 and were repeatedly pushed and hit with plastic crates. Police have again circulated images of people they wish to speak to over those incidents. Via AAP The Victorian Greens MP for Prahran, Sam Hibbins, is standing down from the party after revealing he had a \u201cconsensual relationship with a staff member from my office\u201d. In a statement, Hibbins said the relationship ended \u201csome time ago\u201d but it was a breach of the party room rules. He said: I accept the consequences of my decisions that affect my personal and professional lives. I am working to make amends to the most important people in my life, my family and our community. I\u2019ve always worked hard to advance the Greens\u2019 cause, and know this is a distraction from my work and the work of the Greens, but I remain committed to serving my electorate of Prahran. Hibbins said he understood this incident would \u201cshake people\u2019s trust in politicians\u201d. At a time when life is so difficult for so many, when people are struggling and are already disengaged from politics, I know something like this will shake people\u2019s trust in politicians and politics even further. We are human and we make mistakes. The important thing is making amends and focusing on what really matters. For me, it\u2019s my beautiful family. It\u2019s continuing my fight for social and economic justice and the unacceptable fact that so many Victorians cannot afford groceries or a place to live. It\u2019s continuing to fight for the fantastic community I love and live in, Prahran. I leave the party room with goodwill towards my Greens colleagues. They\u2019re doing a terrific job. I wish them well in the future. I deeply regret what has happened. I have made a very human mistake, but I am working to find the best way forward. Faruqi says court ruling shows \u2018hate speech is not free speech\u2019 Senator Mehreen Faruqi has released a statement on the federal court found Pauline Hanson racially vilified her in a post to X. Faruqi said it meant \u201cmigrants and people of colour should know that they don\u2019t have to be grateful and keep quiet\u201d. \u201cI will be louder and more defiant than ever.\u201d Faruqi\u2019s statement said: This ruling draws a line in the sand that hate speech is not free speech, and that people who racially target marginalised communities cannot get away with it scot-free. The court has made clear that there is no place for the relentless and vile racism so many of us have been copping throughout our lives here. It sends a strong message to racists that they will be held to account. I hope this helps us build an anti-racist Australia. The decision to take Pauline Hanson to court was not taken lightly, and it has taken a very personal toll on me and my family, but I did it for so many people who bear the brunt of racism and who are impacted by destructive racist language every single day. I have been vindicated today, and so have they. It is about time Senator Pauline Hanson faced consequences for the racism she\u2019s been piling on Muslims, people of colour and First Nations people for more than 30 years. She has been found to have engaged in racist behaviour and I hope she reflects on that. Racism is rife in this country and Muslims are being marginalised, silenced, smeared and vilified more than ever for taking a stand against Israel\u2019s genocide in Gaza. This decision becomes even more important in the context of rising Islamophobia. Dark Mofo is returning next year after skipping a year. The festival, a \u201cmidwinter solstice festival\u201d, has today announced a full return in 2025 including a music program, the winter feast, the ogoh-ogoh, night mass and the nude solstice swim. The festival skipped this year due to rising costs and the need for a \u201creset\u201d. Dark Mofo artistic director Chris Twite said: Dark Mofo is back. For our eleventh chapter once more we\u2019ll bathe the city in red and deliver two weeks of inspiring art, music and ritual. The full Dark Mofo 2025 program details will be announced next year. Senator Faruqi, who was in tears in the courtroom as the judge handed down his ruling \u2013 as were most of her legal team \u2013 has addressed the media outside the federal court, saying that the win today was legally \u201chistoric\u201d and sent \u201ca strong message to racists that they will be held accountable\u201d. \u201cToday is a good day for people of colour, Muslims and all of us who have been working to build an anti-racist society,\u201d she said. Today is a win for every single person who has been told to go back to where they came from \u2013 and believe me there are too many of us who have been subjected to this ultimate racist slur far too many times in this country. Telling someone to go back to where they came from is a strong form of racism and it is also an affirmation for migrants that people of colour do not have to be grateful or to keep quiet, and I will be speaking out more loudly and more strongly than ever before Faruqi said the judgment \u201cdraws a line that hate speech is not free speech and those who subject people to racial abuse will not get away scot-free.\u201d Today\u2019s judgment is landmark, it is historic and it is groundbreaking and it will set a new precedent of how racism is viewed in this country. It is a warning for people like Pauline Hanson and I do hope it emboldens individuals and communities to assert their right to live free from racism. Faruqi thanked her family, staff and legal team, saying: The decision to take Pauline Hanson to court was not taken lightly and it has taken a very personal toll on me and my family, but I did it for everyone in this country who feels and is targeted by the destructive impact of racist language. Today I have been vindicated and all those people who face racism have been vindicated as well. Boom in new doctors as record numbers move to Australia, Butler says The most recent cohort of new doctors was the largest influx in over a decade, with one new doctor added every hour last year on average, health minister Mark Butler says. The registration of 9,490 new doctors in 2023-24 was even greater than the 2022-23 cohort of 8,356 new doctors, which at the time was the largest influx of new doctors in more than a decade, according to a statement Butler released this morning. The boom is driven by record numbers of internationally qualified doctors moving to Australia, Butler says. The 5,431 doctors from overseas registered to practise in Australia in the past financial year represents an 80% increase on the 2,991 doctors who registered in 2018-19, the last year before Covid. It follows changes implemented under the Kruk review which have reduced the time for internationally qualified doctors\u2019 applications to be assessed, which went from over 100 days in 2021-22 to less than 70 days in 2023-24. Butler says there are also more doctors choosing to become general practitioners, bucking the trend that has seen government reports warn there would not be enough to meet growing healthcare needs. In 2024, there was a 13% increase on the year before of doctors accepting a place on a government-funded training program to become a GP or rural GP with more than 1,600. Next year there are expected to be more than 1,750 offers made to junior doctors to begin GP training, leading to an intake that could be up to 10% larger than 2024, according to the health minister. Butler says: We know the difficulty that too many Australians face getting in to see a doctor and we are doing everything we can to attract, train and retain more doctors. Senator Faruqi is outside the federal court in Sydney, celebrating with her legal team: NSW expands Indigenous youth program to deter from crime The Safe Aboriginal Youth program is expanding to new locations across New South Wales, as part of the Minns government\u2019s reforms announced in Moree. The program, which provides a safe transport and outreach service to keep young people off the streets late at night, is designed to help divert young people from crime and reduce the risk of them becoming victims of crime. It will have new locations in Moree, Orange, Coffs Harbour and Tamworth, and will also expand services in Dubbo. These locations were identified after consultation with local communities and analysis of crime data. The program already operates in Kempsey, Taree, Newcastle, Dubbo, Bourke and Wilcannia. This expansion is part of the Minns Labor government\u2019s $26.2m package of initiatives it says will address youth crime in regional NSW. Aboriginal community controlled organisations will be prioritised to manage services in new locations. \u201cThe journey for every young person across NSW is different, and we want to make sure as many young people as possible have opportunities to find a positive path in life,\u201d the minister for youth justice, Jihad Dib, said. Our priority is to keep young people safe, supported and away from possible involvement with the justice system. The minister for Aboriginal affairs and treaty, David Harris, said: Early intervention is critical to giving at-risk youth the best chance of staying away from harmful activities and getting their lives on a positive pathway. Australia\u2019s largest corporations paid almost $100bn in income tax in a year, fresh statistics published by the government reveal. The latest data, released by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) on Friday, covers the 2022-23 financial year, and reveals the office received $97.9bn in income tax from large corporations, an increase of 16.7% from the previous year. ATO deputy commissioner Rebecca Saint said that when also considering additional tax revenue raised by the ATO\u2019s tax avoidance task force, revenues from large corporates totalled $100bn in 2022-23. Tax paid by the oil and gas sector increased from $1.5bn in 2021-22 to $11.6bn in 2022-23, with some oil and gas companies now among the largest taxpayers in Australia, Saint said. This result was driven by a combination of commodity prices, the project production life cycle and ATO intervention, she said. The ATO noted that the $100bn figure for 2022-23 was difficult to compare to previous years, because the definition of what was considered a large corporation in the corporate tax transport (CCT) report increased to cover Australian-owned private entities with total income above $100m, up from the $200m threshold in previous years. The share of entities that paid no income tax has decreased from 36% in 2013\u201314 to 31% in 2022\u201323. Saint said: While there are legitimate reasons why a company may pay no income tax, the Australian community can be assured we pay close attention to those who pay no income tax to ensure that they are not trying to game the system. Faruqi in tears after court ruling An emotional Senator Mehreen Faruqi hugged her legal team in tears after a judge declared that a tweet from Senator Pauline Hanson about her, in which Hanson said Faruqi should \u201cpiss off back to Pakistan\u201d, had breach Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. Justice Angus Stewart found the tweet from Hanson, in response to one posted by Faruqi regarding the Queen\u2019s death, portrayed Faruqi as a \u201csecond-class citizen\u201d who \u201ctook advantage\u201d of Australia and as a migrant to the country \u201cshould be grateful for what she has and keep quiet\u201d, which he declared to be \u201cexclusionary\u201d. Stewart also found Hanson\u2019s comment that Faruqi should \u201cpiss off back to Pakistan\u201d was a \u201cvariant of the slogan \u2018go back to from where you came from\u2019\u201d, which he said was an \u201cevident racist trope\u201d and a \u201cstrong form of racism\u201d. Justice Angus Stewart has found that Pauline Hanson\u2019s tweet, where she said Mehreen Faruqi should \u201cpiss off back to Pakistan\u201d, is unlawful. Hanson will need to delete the tweet and pay Faruqi\u2019s costs for the proceedings. Stewart rejected Hanson\u2019s arguments, including that Faruqi\u2019s tweet on the Queen\u2019s passing justified her response, and that it did not fall within the fair comment exemption because it was a \u201cangry, personal attack\u201d. The judge said: The court has concluded that the tweet was reasonably likely in all the circumstances to have been profoundly and seriously offensive, insulting, humiliating and intimidating to a significant number of members of the identified groups and to the reasonable targeted person in the position of Senator Faruqi. Based on frequent public statements made by Senator Hanson over nearly three decades, the court has found that Senator Hanson has a tendency to make negative, derogatory, discriminating or hateful statements in relation to about or against groups of people relevantly identified as persons of colour, migrants to Australia and Muslims, and to do so because of those characteristics. He said that under section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, the post was unlawful in that \u201cit was reasonably likely in all the circumstances to offend and self humiliate and intimidate the applicant and groups of people, namely people of colour who are migrants to Australia or are Australians of relatively recent migrant heritage and Muslims who are people of colour in Australia\u201d. Court to rule in Pauline Hanson-Mehreen Faruqi case A federal court judge is ready to rule on whether Pauline Hanson made a racial slur when she told Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi to go back to Pakistan. Justice Angus Stewart presided over the federal court lawsuit brought by Faruqi, who alleged the One Nation leader engaged in racial discrimination in a post on X when she wrote that Faruqi should \u201cpack [her] bags and piss off back to Pakistan\u201d. Hanson was responding to Farqui\u2019s reflections on the passing of the queen, where she wrote that she could not mourn the passing of the leader of a \u201cracist empire built on stolen lives, land and wealth of colonised peoples\u201d. The case went through a four-day trial in the federal court before Justice Stewart in which Hanson claimed she did not know Faruqi was Muslim when posting the comment. But Faruqi produced ample evidence showing she publicly identified as Muslim on various occasions, including in communications with the One Nation head. Hanson has denied she engaged in racial discrimination by sending the post. The court will today determine whether Hanson engaged in racial discrimination, identify any damages that may flow as a result, and settle a position on her argument that parts of the Racial Discrimination Act are not constitutional. Queensland truth-telling inquiry\u2019s halt \u2018unprecedented\u2019 \u2013 chair Queensland\u2019s truth-telling and healing inquiry has been paused following comments by the state\u2019s new premier, David Crisafulli. The LNP, which won government at the weekend, had committed to shut down the inquiry and repeal its legislation. That would also end the pathway to treaties with Aboriginal Queenslanders. On late Thursday afternoon chairperson Joshua Creamer said to do so would be \u201cunprecedented\u201d. \u201cIt must be noted that this is unprecedented. It is unheard of that an independent inquiry be shut down by a change of government,\u201d he said. If the inquiry is formally stopped it will be a lost opportunity for the state. We are not going to get another opportunity at this in the next decade, two decades, in my lifetime. Crisafulli told a press conference earlier Thursday that he would repeal the Pathway to Treaty Act as one of his first acts in government. The bill will be repealed this year, he said. The inquiry has sittings planned for December. \u201cWe won\u2019t be allowing those to go ahead, but it\u2019ll be done with respect and decency, and there will be a relentless focus from the government departments to do good by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people,\u201d Crisafulli said, on Thursday. Crisafulli said his \u201cstrong advice\u201d to the people running the inquiry is \u201cthe new government has been very clear that we are not embarking on that process\u201d. Creamer said he\u2019d had no communication from the new government. However, based on the Premier\u2019s comments, the Inquiry will pause its current workplan until further information is available. This pause aligns with our trauma-aware and healing- informed approach and is to protect the wellbeing of participants and all Queenslanders currently engaged with the Inquiry. People sharing their stories to capture an accurate history of our state is not divisive and I\u2019m hopeful the Inquiry can remain in some form to continue this critical work before it\u2019s too late. The LNP voted for the treaty and truthtelling laws in 2023, but changed its mind after the failed voice referendum last year. About 68% of Queenslanders voted no in the voice referendum last year, the highest of any state. Two NSW police dogs die during transport to training day Police in New South Wales will investigate how two dogs from its canine units died while being driven to a training day. NSW Police announced they had launched an investigation after police dog Xtra and development dog Soldier were found dead within an air-conditioned pod inside a purpose built police vehicle. In the statement, police said the dogs\u2019 handlers had driven them to a development day at \u201ca Lucas Heights facility\u201d. Lucas Heights is a suburb in south-west Sydney known as the home of Australia\u2019s only nuclear reactor. \u201cAbout 12.30pm, the handler conducted a routine check, finding PD Xtra and DD Soldier deceased in the police vehicle,\u201d the statement said. The dogs were taken to a specialist veterinary clinic but were unable to be revived. PD Xtra, a German Shepherd, was accredited as a general-purpose dog in July 2018 and was attached to the Newcastle/Central Coast Dog Unit. DD Soldier, a German Shepherd, commenced service with the Dog Unit in February 2024 for training and development. NSW Police commissioner Karen Webb said \u201ctoday is a very sad day for the Dog Unit and the thoughts of the whole police family are with them\u201d. \u201cWe owe it to PD Xtra and DD Soldier to conduct a thorough investigation.\u201d Labor receives online safety review ahead of law revamp The federal government has received an independent review of the Online Safety Act that will form an overhaul of the law, expected to be announced before the end of the year. The review, conducted by Delia Rickard PSM, began in April and received over 2,200 responses and held meetings with over 100 stakeholders. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, did not release the report to the public, but said the recommendations would be considered and responded to \u201cshortly\u201d. It comes as the eSafety commissioner abandoned a legal fight last month against Elon Musk\u2019s X platform over attempting to force the removal of dozens of tweets with the video of the stabbing of a Wakeley church bishop in April. The eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, indicated that it was better to address the validity of her powers over the platforms in the Online Safety Act review rather than through a court process. It is also expected that changes to the Online Safety Act will include the introduction of age assurance to restrict access to social media for younger teens, pending the outcome of a trial of the technologies that could be used. Flight attendants set for pay rises up to 28% under new IR laws New industrial relations laws that come into effect from today mean that hundreds of flight attendants stand to benefit from pay rises up to 28%. The \u2018same job same pay\u2019 laws mean that airlines such as Qantas \u2013 which has been criticised for employing cabin crew on an array of different agreements, including some directly and others through third parties \u2013 can no longer pay workers on the same flight at different rates. In a statement, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) said more than 800 cabin crew employed through labour hire firms will see pay rises of up to 28% from today. ACTU secretary Sally McManus said \u201cthese wage increases are life-changing for flight attendants and their loved ones\u201d. Working people across many industries are experiencing the benefits of the Albanese Government refusing to bend to big business who lobbied hard to stop these laws, including CEOs like [former Qantas chief] Alan Joyce. Flight Attendants Association of Australia federal secretary Teri O\u2019Toole said: \u201cSome of our cabin crew can earn significantly less than directly employed crew despite doing the same job, all because they are technically employed by a labour hire company. This first wave of pay rises for our members will go a long way in restoring dignity to our profession. Cabin crew are undervalued and underpaid for the tireless work they do every day. And if you haven\u2019t yet listened, Reged Ahmad\u2019s Full Story episode on the saga is a must listen, link below: Earlier in that same interview, Bridget McKenzie admitted she had actually received a flight upgrade, after earlier this week being adamant she hadn\u2019t. The shadow transport minister apologised on air, saying she has asked Qantas, Virgin and administrators of Rex for her flight records to clear up anything she hadn\u2019t declared. Earlier this week, I said I\u2019d never received an upgrade. I checked my records, and checked that I declared an upgrade. So that, for me, you know, really instigated how to getting to the bottom of this. And I think really the only way can do that is by getting a full log of flights and upgrades from the three domestic airlines. I\u2019ve been calling on the prime minister as a way since last weekend to actually do the same. And so I don\u2019t probably believe I should be subjecting other people to standards I\u2019m not prepared to subject myself to. So when that information comes in, I will be obviously updating my declarations. I think for transparency and accountability, I have to obviously update a public declarations as quickly as possible. \u2022 An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that McKenzie had admitted she received flight upgrades that she hadn\u2019t declared. Bridget McKenzie grilled on Dutton\u2019s free flights from Rinehart Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie has danced around questions around whether Gina Rinehart expects anything \u201cin return\u201d for the free flights she has given opposition leader Peter Dutton. In a tense interview with Patricia Karvelas on RN Breakfast earlier, the shadow transport minister was happy to criticise the PM for reportedly asking for upgrades to Qantas flights (something he has denied happened) but was much more coy on what it meant for Dutton to be accepting flights from the country\u2019s richest person. This is what she said when asked if Rinehart would expect anything in return: No, I don\u2019t think so. Similarly to Ms Reinhardt sponsoring our Olympic swimming team and rowing team, her expectation was that those young athletes would be supported to represent their country as best they can, and they absolutely did. So I don\u2019t think we need to always think that people assisting has a quid pro quo, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have public declarations and important to look at behaviour. I don\u2019t think that wanting a strong, prosperous and sustainable mining industry in this country is something that only Peter Dutton wants to see. The Coalition wants to see that. I think hundreds of thousands of workers, our allies, that are in receipt of our resources exports, want to see that continue as well. I\u2019d be very concerned with any leaders in our parliament that don\u2019t want to be seeing a prospect of sustainable mining. New Radio National Breakfast host is Sally Sara Seasoned foreign correspondent Sally Sara will take over as Radio National Breakfast host next year. The presenter of ABC Radio\u2019s The World Today since 2020, Sara has reported from more than 40 countries as an ABC foreign correspondent, including Africa, Iraq, India and Afghanistan. Sara said: I\u2019m extremely grateful for the opportunity to join the Radio National Breakfast team. I can\u2019t wait. I will work hard to engage the audience with stories from across the country and around the world. Sara replaces Patricia Karvelas, who will present Afternoon Briefing on the ABC News channel next year, as well as Q+A and weekly political wrap The Party Room. Good morning, Mostafa Rachwani with you to take you through the day\u2019s news. We begin with Gina Rinehart, whose company Hancock Prospecting has just reported a bumper profit of $5.6bn. The enormous profit mostly comes from consistent iron ore volumes coming out of the Roy Hill, Hope Downs and Atlas Iron operations \u2013 with a record output from Roy Hill. In a statement, Hancock Prospecting also made a note of the $3.9bn it paid in taxes in the past year. Elsewhere, Queensland\u2019s truth-telling inquiry is under threat, with the newly installed LNP government intent on shutting it down. Premier David Crisafulli told a press conference on Thursday that he would repeal the Pathway to Treaty Act as one of his first acts in government. The bill would be repealed this year, he said, leaving scheduled sittings in December in flux. We\u2019ll bring you more on those stories, and everything else happening around the country as it comes. Stay tuned.",

      "body": "<p>Reform UK is facing a schism over its approach to Tommy Robinson\u2019s supporters, after two high-profile party figures said it was wrong to disavow those who went to a weekend rally backing the far-right leader.</p> <p>Richard Tice, the deputy leader of Reform, said earlier this week the party \u201cwant nothing to do with\u201d Robinson and \u201call of that lot\u201d. Nigel Farage, the Reform leader, also said after the summer riots that he had never had anything to do with \u201cthe Tommy Robinsons and those who genuinely do stir up hatred\u201d.</p> <p>But two high-profile 2024 candidates, Howard Cox and Ben Habib, took a different position, saying those attending Saturday\u2019s rally were some of Reform\u2019s own people.</p> <p>Thousands of supporters of Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, protested in central London on Saturday after he was remanded into custody by police. The far-right activist was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/28/tommy-robinson-admits-contempt-of-court-over-false-claims-about-refugee\">jailed on Monday</a> for 18 months for contempt of court for repeating false allegations against a Syrian refugee, in breach of an injunction.</p> <p>After the sentencing, Cox, who stood as Reform\u2019s London mayoral candidate and as a parliamentary candidate in Dover and Deal, said Robinson should not be in jail and Tice had been wrong to distance the party from those who attended the rally.</p> <p>Speaking on Dan Wootton\u2019s Outspoken show, Cox agreed with his host that Robinson should not be in jail and said he, too, was one of \u201cthat lot\u201d \u2013 a reference to Tice\u2019s comments. He added that Farage had told him Tice had gone \u201cover the top\u201d in his criticism.</p> <p>\u201cThis week, unfortunately, Richard \u2026 said I want nothing to do with Tommy Robinson or his lot. It\u2019s a bit sad because I\u2019m a good friend of Richard and we are close but that was wrong \u2026 I am one of that lot. Nigel actually did contact me privately and he just simply said Richard went over the top,\u201d Cox told Wootton.</p> <p>He added: \u201cI love him to death, but I think Richard has got to come out and clarify what he really meant. He was actually saying he was against thuggery and violence. Most of the people there, 99% of the people at all of these things, are just concerned about getting our country back.\u201d</p> <p>Habib, until recently the co-deputy leader of Reform, also stood up for those who had attended Saturday\u2019s rally to support Robinson.</p> <p>Speaking to Paul Thorpe, a watch dealer turned YouTuber and founder of a \u201cpatriotic movement\u201d called Unite UK, Habib said: \u201cThose of us who care about this country, who want to stand against the uniparty of the Tories and Labour, have to stick together. We are one group.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Tommy Robinson, I\u2019m not going to venture an opinion on Tommy Robinson. But certainly, I\u2019m not going to throw him under a bus. What I do know is the thousands, tens of thousands of people who congregated in Whitehall on Saturday, I know many people who told me they were there. They are our friends, they are Reform voters and we need to stand firmly behind them.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if there was a difference of opinion on Robinson supporters within Reform, Habib told the Guardian Farage \u201ccarries an interesting balancing act\u201d as someone who appeared a \u201cfirebrand rightwinger\u201d but who also had to \u201ccurry favour with the mainstream media\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cAs far as I am aware there is no Reform UK policy on Tommy Robinson. And as far as Tommy Robinson is concerned, I do not know him. I will not condemn someone whom I do not know. Reform is in the business of garnering votes. Votes of all UK citizens are eligible as far as I am aware. There are no such things as Labour supporters or Tory supporters when it comes to seeking votes. Indeed, Reform\u2019s strength is in attracting voters from across the political spectrum.</p> <p>He said that he imagined those who attended the rally at Whitehall last week were mainly British citizens. \u201cThere were many from minority ethnic backgrounds, and flags from across the UK were being flown. I think I also saw a flag from Northern Ireland, a region close to my heart. I cannot make any case for rejecting the votes of these people, some of whom I knew.\u201d</p> <p>Cox told the Guardian he would \u201crather not comment any further\u201d. Tice, approached for comment, said: \u201cFree speech is a wonderful thing; we are so lucky.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 November 2024 to remove a reference in a quote to estimated numbers at the Uniting the Kingdom rally.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Reform UK is facing a schism over its approach to Tommy Robinson\u2019s supporters, after two high-profile party figures said it was wrong to disavow those who went to a weekend rally backing the far-right leader. Richard Tice, the deputy leader of Reform, said earlier this week the party \u201cwant nothing to do with\u201d Robinson and \u201call of that lot\u201d. Nigel Farage, the Reform leader, also said after the summer riots that he had never had anything to do with \u201cthe Tommy Robinsons and those who genuinely do stir up hatred\u201d. But two high-profile 2024 candidates, Howard Cox and Ben Habib, took a different position, saying those attending Saturday\u2019s rally were some of Reform\u2019s own people. Thousands of supporters of Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, protested in central London on Saturday after he was remanded into custody by police. The far-right activist was jailed on Monday for 18 months for contempt of court for repeating false allegations against a Syrian refugee, in breach of an injunction. After the sentencing, Cox, who stood as Reform\u2019s London mayoral candidate and as a parliamentary candidate in Dover and Deal, said Robinson should not be in jail and Tice had been wrong to distance the party from those who attended the rally. Speaking on Dan Wootton\u2019s Outspoken show, Cox agreed with his host that Robinson should not be in jail and said he, too, was one of \u201cthat lot\u201d \u2013 a reference to Tice\u2019s comments. He added that Farage had told him Tice had gone \u201cover the top\u201d in his criticism. \u201cThis week, unfortunately, Richard \u2026 said I want nothing to do with Tommy Robinson or his lot. It\u2019s a bit sad because I\u2019m a good friend of Richard and we are close but that was wrong \u2026 I am one of that lot. Nigel actually did contact me privately and he just simply said Richard went over the top,\u201d Cox told Wootton. He added: \u201cI love him to death, but I think Richard has got to come out and clarify what he really meant. He was actually saying he was against thuggery and violence. Most of the people there, 99% of the people at all of these things, are just concerned about getting our country back.\u201d Habib, until recently the co-deputy leader of Reform, also stood up for those who had attended Saturday\u2019s rally to support Robinson. Speaking to Paul Thorpe, a watch dealer turned YouTuber and founder of a \u201cpatriotic movement\u201d called Unite UK, Habib said: \u201cThose of us who care about this country, who want to stand against the uniparty of the Tories and Labour, have to stick together. We are one group. \u201cI don\u2019t know Tommy Robinson, I\u2019m not going to venture an opinion on Tommy Robinson. But certainly, I\u2019m not going to throw him under a bus. What I do know is the thousands, tens of thousands of people who congregated in Whitehall on Saturday, I know many people who told me they were there. They are our friends, they are Reform voters and we need to stand firmly behind them.\u201d Asked if there was a difference of opinion on Robinson supporters within Reform, Habib told the Guardian Farage \u201ccarries an interesting balancing act\u201d as someone who appeared a \u201cfirebrand rightwinger\u201d but who also had to \u201ccurry favour with the mainstream media\u201d. He added: \u201cAs far as I am aware there is no Reform UK policy on Tommy Robinson. And as far as Tommy Robinson is concerned, I do not know him. I will not condemn someone whom I do not know. Reform is in the business of garnering votes. Votes of all UK citizens are eligible as far as I am aware. There are no such things as Labour supporters or Tory supporters when it comes to seeking votes. Indeed, Reform\u2019s strength is in attracting voters from across the political spectrum. He said that he imagined those who attended the rally at Whitehall last week were mainly British citizens. \u201cThere were many from minority ethnic backgrounds, and flags from across the UK were being flown. I think I also saw a flag from Northern Ireland, a region close to my heart. I cannot make any case for rejecting the votes of these people, some of whom I knew.\u201d Cox told the Guardian he would \u201crather not comment any further\u201d. Tice, approached for comment, said: \u201cFree speech is a wonderful thing; we are so lucky.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 7 November 2024 to remove a reference in a quote to estimated numbers at the Uniting the Kingdom rally.",

      "body": "<p>The US presidential election has not been the only high-stakes date looming for Elon Musk. It has been more than a year since Swedish workers came out on strike against his electric car giant Tesla. Swedish industrial union IF Metall has been demanding better wages, benefits and conditions for mechanics in Tesla repair shops across the country, but fundamentally what is at stake is the Swedish labour market model of collective bargaining which Musk refuses to recognise.</p> <p>It is the <a href=\"https://www.industriall-union.org/swedish-union-warns-of-strike-at-tesla\">first and only strike</a> against Tesla anywhere in the world. And it has now become the longest-running strike in Sweden for a century. In April, six months into the dispute, Musk said: \u201cActually, I think the storm has passed on that front, I think things are in reasonably good shape in Sweden.\u201d That was not true then, and <a href=\"https://news.industriall-europe.eu/Article/1150\">it is not true now</a>.</p> <p>The past year has been marked by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/10/elon-musk-sweden-unions-tesla-labour-car\">a wave of solidarity strikes by other unions</a> to block the shipping of Tesla cars to Swedish ports, halt the cleaning of Tesla facilities, withhold postal deliveries, including new number plates, to all Tesla offices and prevent Tesla charging stations being connected to the power grid. Tesla has repeatedly lost legal battles against these solidarity strikes, and <a href=\"https://www.arbetsvarlden.se/domstolssmall-mot-tesla-tvingas-betala-65-miljoner/\">was recently f</a>orced to pay SEK6.5m (\u00a3468,000) in legal costs to the Swedish postal service, PostNord. </p> <p>Twelve Swedish trade unions are involved and three Nordic ones, including Norway\u2019s transport union Fellesforbundet and 3F Transport in Denmark. Meanwhile, Tesla has <a href=\"https://da.se/2024/05/utlandska-strejkbrytare-flygs-in-till-teslas-verkstader-okat-kraftigt-sedan-arsskiftet/\">brought in strikebreakers</a> from the UK, France, Italy, Spain, Finland, Denmark and many other European countries to cover the 52 striking workers, almost half of Tesla\u2019s mechanics in the country.</p> <p>While legal under Swedish law, the use of strikebreakers is anathema for unions and employers alike in Nordic countries where unwritten rules and norms are essential to their model of worker protection, which rests on collective agreements between employer and employees negotiated via a union. In Sweden, almost 90% of the <a href=\"https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flucris.lub.lu.se%2Fws%2Fportalfiles%2Fportal%2F153810957%2FTrade_unions_in_Sweden_2023._Updated_statistical_data.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cljames%40etuc.org%7C7d436beecb124d45840c08dcee943ffc%7C7a57d45075f34a4da90dac04a367b91a%7C0%7C0%7C638647567736707488%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=KxpqhD7eBzFlAPJOdWq10C%2F6vZxySXQvsjyzUQ4PAG4%3D&amp;reserved=0\">workforce is covered by a collective agreement</a>, across all sectors. For Tesla, this seems to be of little concern to its notoriously anti-union CEO.</p> <p>Yet the battle has implications far beyond this northernmost corner of Europe. The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/uaw-union-vote-volkswagen-tesla-elon-musk-organizing-2024-4\">United Auto Workers is seeking</a> to organise at Tesla factories in the US and the powerful German union <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-union-slams-aggressive-tesla-firing-works-council-rep-2024-10-14/\">IG Metall is attempting</a> to do the same in Gr\u00fcnheide, the site of Tesla\u2019s only European factory. As Johan J\u00e4rvklo, the international secretary of IF Metall, <a href=\"https://www.industriall-union.org/in-sweden-the-fight-against-tesla-continues\">has said</a>: \u201cIt\u2019s really a global struggle and Sweden is currently at the forefront.\u201d</p>    <p>From the union perspective, allowing Tesla to get away without signing an agreement would risk encouraging other employers in Sweden and Europe to do the same. And from Tesla\u2019s point of view, there is the concern that saying yes to collective bargaining in Sweden could be used as leverage by unions in other countries where Tesla has factories and many more employees.

      "bodyText": "The US presidential election has not been the only high-stakes date looming for Elon Musk. It has been more than a year since Swedish workers came out on strike against his electric car giant Tesla. Swedish industrial union IF Metall has been demanding better wages, benefits and conditions for mechanics in Tesla repair shops across the country, but fundamentally what is at stake is the Swedish labour market model of collective bargaining which Musk refuses to recognise. It is the first and only strike against Tesla anywhere in the world. And it has now become the longest-running strike in Sweden for a century. In April, six months into the dispute, Musk said: \u201cActually, I think the storm has passed on that front, I think things are in reasonably good shape in Sweden.\u201d That was not true then, and it is not true now. The past year has been marked by a wave of solidarity strikes by other unions to block the shipping of Tesla cars to Swedish ports, halt the cleaning of Tesla facilities, withhold postal deliveries, including new number plates, to all Tesla offices and prevent Tesla charging stations being connected to the power grid. Tesla has repeatedly lost legal battles against these solidarity strikes, and was recently forced to pay SEK6.5m (\u00a3468,000) in legal costs to the Swedish postal service, PostNord. Twelve Swedish trade unions are involved and three Nordic ones, including Norway\u2019s transport union Fellesforbundet and 3F Transport in Denmark. Meanwhile, Tesla has brought in strikebreakers from the UK, France, Italy, Spain, Finland, Denmark and many other European countries to cover the 52 striking workers, almost half of Tesla\u2019s mechanics in the country. While legal under Swedish law, the use of strikebreakers is anathema for unions and employers alike in Nordic countries where unwritten rules and norms are essential to their model of worker protection, which rests on collective agreements between employer and employees negotiated via a union. In Sweden, almost 90% of the workforce is covered by a collective agreement, across all sectors. For Tesla, this seems to be of little concern to its notoriously anti-union CEO. Yet the battle has implications far beyond this northernmost corner of Europe. The United Auto Workers is seeking to organise at Tesla factories in the US and the powerful German union IG Metall is attempting to do the same in Gr\u00fcnheide, the site of Tesla\u2019s only European factory. As Johan J\u00e4rvklo, the international secretary of IF Metall, has said: \u201cIt\u2019s really a global struggle and Sweden is currently at the forefront.\u201d From the union perspective, allowing Tesla to get away without signing an agreement would risk encouraging other employers in Sweden and Europe to do the same. And from Tesla\u2019s point of view, there is the concern that saying yes to collective bargaining in Sweden could be used as leverage by unions in other countries where Tesla has factories and many more employees. In Sweden, Tesla only has dealerships, offices, repair shops and charging stations. Although Tesla\u2019s apprehension may be understandable, it stems from a limited understanding of European industrial relations systems. Joining a union is a fundamental right of all Swedish workers, and almost half of the company\u2019s mechanics in Sweden are union members. This means that by law Tesla has to negotiate with the union on many issues, even if no collective agreement has been signed. IF Metall recently filed a lawsuit against Tesla for failing to inform and negotiate with union members over workplace changes, in accordance with Swedish labour law. In addition, in some parts of Europe, collective bargaining agreements with one company in an industry or region extend by law to most other companies in that industry or region. This is the case in Austria, Spain, the Netherlands, Finland and France, where firms must comply with extended collective bargaining agreements whether they have signed them or not. And, it turns out, Tesla already has collective agreements in Europe. Although representatives of the company reportedly stated last year that Tesla \u201chas no collective agreement anywhere in the world\u201d, my research has uncovered three local agreements between Tesla France and the largest union in France CFDT. (They are registered on L\u00e9gifrance, the official website of the French government for the publication of legal documents such as collective agreements.) I believe this new discovery could help to resolve the Swedish stalemate and prevent disputes in other countries. Why? Well, since Tesla already has to comply with sectoral collective agreements in many countries, and even has local agreements in France, it would not be setting a precedent if it did the same in Sweden. So it should start to see unions as a partner to negotiate with, rather than an enemy. Even Tesla\u2019s own global human rights policy states that \u201cin conformance with local law, Tesla respects the right of workers to form and join trade unions of their own choosing \u2026 or to form and join other employee representative bodies \u2026 to bargain collectively\u201d. If the company operated in the spirit of this policy, surely it should be perfectly able to adapt to different countries\u2019 regulations and norms and prevent this unnecessary strike in Sweden from continuing any further into its second year.

The rules, framed by the 2010 Citizens United v FEC supreme court ruling, allow corporations, special interest groups and wealthy individuals \u2013 such as the billionaire Elon Musk through his controversial Trump-aligned America Pac \u2013 to make eye-popping and almost unrestricted contributions, and to buy oversized influence in elections and their aftermath. \u201cCitizens United, and subsequent other cases, opened the door for corporate contributions to related entities to campaigns, and allowed for what are commonly referred to as dark-money groups to spend money on politics without disclosing who that money came from,\u201d said the attorney Noah Bookbinder, president and chief executive of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew). \u201cWealthy people have always been a political force, but a small group of billionaires have become just a huge part of the machine, fueling political campaigns now, both in terms of giving to dark-money organizations and giving to Super Pacs. In the case of Elon Musk, his Super Pac is essentially operating as an unchecked piece of the Trump campaign apparatus. \u201cIt\u2019s troubling because we don\u2019t want this country to slide into being the kind of oligarchy you see in a place like Russia where a small number of very wealthy individuals have outsize influence over the people in charge.\u201d Musk\u2019s self-funded Pac reported $130m in receipts, the latest FEC disclosure showed. Democratic-aligned Pacs ActBlue, the Harris Victory Fund and the DNC, filled three of the top four places with receipts of more than $5bn. The leading Republican Pac, WinRed, reported $1.4bn. A new report from Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF), meanwhile, shows Musk in third place among individual donors, behind the banking and oil magnate Tim Mellon ($172m) and the Las Vegas-based Adelson family of hoteliers ($137m). All three donated to Republicans. In all, the ATF said, 150 billionaire families have so far contributed $1.9bn among them to Pacs supporting presidential and congressional candidates in the 2024 cycle, a 60% rise from the 2020 total given by more than 600 individual billionaires. \u201cBillionaire campaign spending on this scale drowns out the voices and concerns of ordinary Americans,\u201d said David Kass, ATF\u2019s executive director. Bradley Smith, professor at Capital University law school and FEC chair during the administration of George W Bush, said it was wrong to blame Citizens United for the cash swishing around in Harris\u2019s, or Trump\u2019s, coffers. \u201cThe vast majority of the money is coming from individuals subject to campaign finance limits. All the money Kamala Harris has raised directly in her campaign comes from individuals in amounts of $3,300 or less,\u201d he said. \u201cThe law has played a part but more than that, it\u2019s maybe a little bit of a cultural zeitgeist. People seem to really feel there\u2019s a lot at stake in this election and one of the few ways people can participate in a campaign beyond voting is by giving money. \u201cMost people don\u2019t have time to go knock on doors, and a lot of it has been supercharged by the internet, which makes it really easy and low-cost to get small donors to contribute: \u2018Click on this button, send us $20.\u2019 Some of these people do that 30, 40, 50 times, and all of a sudden you\u2019re talking real money.\u201d",

The story of how black Americans came to Britain to fight slavery has still not been fully recognised. The Missing Pieces Project aims to shed new light on the struggle by charting the locations on the lecture tours of 19th-century activists.

Now, buildings in 189 cities, towns and villages have been added to Historic England\u2019s Missing Pieces Project, which uncovers overlooked stories behind historic sites with an interactive online map.

Harris\u2019s rally was a joyful affair, with mothers carrying infants on their shoulders, some supporters and volunteers sporting Halloween costumes and star turns by Mexican band Man\u00e1 and Latina singer and actor Jennifer Lopez.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s gaudy pageant warmed up with the sound of Elvis warbling about Dixieland and James Brown\u2019s It\u2019s A Man\u2019s Man\u2019s Man\u2019s World.

It is also about 30% Latino, a demographic that traditionally favours Democrats but where Trump appears to be making inroads this time.</p> \n<p>Las Vegas is booming again with sold out shows, a thriving airport and a Formula One grand prix later this month.

The jobless rate in August was 5.5%, higher than any other state, while gas prices are well above the national average \u2013 issues that Trump has sought to exploit.</p> \n<p>Harris\u2019s rally was staged in a park in the open air against the backdrop of a \u201cWelcome to Las Vegas\u201d sign and attracted a diverse mix across age and race, including young families. There were chants of \u201cWe\u2019re not going back!\u201d Among the speakers was congresswoman Susie Lee, who observed: \u201cI\u2019ve seen some scary costumes today but none of them come close to how scary a Donald Trump presidency would be.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/31/arizona-political-violence-election\">\u2018People are scared\u2019: Arizonans fear political violence as election looms</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Lopez walked out to her track Let\u2019s Get Loud before she gave an emotional 13-minute speech on \u201cthe most important stage I\u2019ve ever been on\u201d.</p> \n<p>She made reference to Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally where US comedian Tony Hinchcliffe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/29/trump-rally-puerto-rico-voter-reaction\">made disparaging remarks about Puerto Rico</a> and its people, which she said is a reminder of how Trump \u201creally is and how he really feels\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just Puerto Ricans that were offended that day, it was every Latino in this country, it was humanity and anyone of decent character,\u201d Lopez said.</p> \n<p>She told the crowd \u201cI believe in the power of women\u201d and \u201cI believe in the power of Latinos\u201d. The actor and singer insisted: \u201cThere is no candidate in the history of the presidency that is more qualified and there is no job that Kamala Harris can\u2019t do.\u201d She also referred to Trump as \u201cthe biggest adversary internally that I think America has ever had\u201d.</p> \n<p>Lopez added: \u201cI am an actress and I like Hollywood endings and I like it when the good guy \u2013 or in this case the good girl \u2013 wins. And with an understanding of our past, and our faith in our future, I will be casting my ballot for Kamala Harris for president of the United States.\u201d</p> \n<p>Harris then entered to enthusiastic cheers and delivered a now familiar stump speech. \u201cIf he were re-elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list,\u201d she said, \u201cWhen I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list \u2026 And at the top of my list is bringing down the cost of your living. That will be my focus every single day as president.\u201d</p> \n<p>She warned of Trump\u2019s desire to sow division and chaos. She also made fun of him by remarking: \u201cYou may have seen I talked in Washington DC the other day. He likes to compare crowd sizes. I had 100,000 people there.\u201d</p> \n<p>At another point, when some in the crowd chanted \u201cLock him up! Lock him up!\u201d, Harris responded: \u201cThe courts are going to handle that. We will handle November.\u201d</p> \n<p>Earlier, the mood at Trump\u2019s rally at an ice hockey stadium in Henderson, just outside Las Vegas, was less charitable. Warm-up speakers included far-right Florida congressman Matt Gaetz and Nevada Republican chair Michael Mcdonald, who mocked Harris\u2019s laugh and derided Democrats as \u201cbeta males\u201d, claiming \u201cWe\u2019re alpha males\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/11/battlegroundhistorical-zip/giv-4559R9px0EbkBomW/\" data-alt=\"Map diagrams showing how the seven battleground states voted in the four previous presidential elections\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/11/battlegroundhistorical-zip/giv-4559R9px0EbkBomW/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Big screens proclaimed \u201cBetter off with Trump\u201d and \u201cTrump will fix it!\u201d Some fans wore yellow vests to resemble garbage collectors, a reference to Joe Biden\u2019s allegedly referring to Trump supporters as \u201cgarbage\u201d.

But Trump\u2019s supporters seemed untroubled by the prospect.</p> \n<p>Kathy Holesapple, 56, an entrepreneur and pilot and aircraft mechanic, said of Democrats: \u201cThey\u2019ve weaponised the women against this party but the truth is that they\u2019ve also held down the women in this nation by calling us Karens.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/11/battlegroundvotes-zip/giv-4559qVEiEn5NmBwF/\" data-alt=\"Maps showing number of electoral college votes in each state\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/11/battlegroundvotes-zip/giv-4559qVEiEn5NmBwF/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not allowed to stand up and speak for our beliefs.

      "bodyText": "From the Rat Pack to Elvis, from fight night to the Sphere, Las Vegas serves up spectacle bigger and brasher than anywhere else. On Thursday the political circus came to Sin City as the US presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump held duelling campaign rallies here. The events offered a tight focus on the contrast at the heart of next week\u2019s election. Harris\u2019s rally was a joyful affair, with mothers carrying infants on their shoulders, some supporters and volunteers sporting Halloween costumes and star turns by Mexican band Man\u00e1 and Latina singer and actor Jennifer Lopez. Trump\u2019s gaudy pageant warmed up with the sound of Elvis warbling about Dixieland and James Brown\u2019s It\u2019s A Man\u2019s Man\u2019s Man\u2019s World. His crowd sported Make America great again caps and other regalia, cheered his demonisation of immigrants, jeered the \u201cfake news\u201d media and broke into chants of \u201cFight! Fight! Fight!\u201d Even in Las Vegas, a city of escapism, bleary eyed gamblers who stagger out of casinos are confronted by the reminders of the presidential contest: Trump\u2019s name is emblazoned on his five-star luxury hotel, while the Harris campaign took out a campaign ad on the giant $2.3bn attraction the Sphere. The rivals are drawn to Nevada because it is one seven swing states expected to play a decisive role in the all-important electoral college. It is also about 30% Latino, a demographic that traditionally favours Democrats but where Trump appears to be making inroads this time. Las Vegas is booming again with sold out shows, a thriving airport and a Formula One grand prix later this month. But the rest of Nevada is in tough times. The jobless rate in August was 5.5%, higher than any other state, while gas prices are well above the national average \u2013 issues that Trump has sought to exploit. Harris\u2019s rally was staged in a park in the open air against the backdrop of a \u201cWelcome to Las Vegas\u201d sign and attracted a diverse mix across age and race, including young families. There were chants of \u201cWe\u2019re not going back!\u201d Among the speakers was congresswoman Susie Lee, who observed: \u201cI\u2019ve seen some scary costumes today but none of them come close to how scary a Donald Trump presidency would be.\u201d Lopez walked out to her track Let\u2019s Get Loud before she gave an emotional 13-minute speech on \u201cthe most important stage I\u2019ve ever been on\u201d. She made reference to Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally where US comedian Tony Hinchcliffe made disparaging remarks about Puerto Rico and its people, which she said is a reminder of how Trump \u201creally is and how he really feels\u201d. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just Puerto Ricans that were offended that day, it was every Latino in this country, it was humanity and anyone of decent character,\u201d Lopez said. She told the crowd \u201cI believe in the power of women\u201d and \u201cI believe in the power of Latinos\u201d. The actor and singer insisted: \u201cThere is no candidate in the history of the presidency that is more qualified and there is no job that Kamala Harris can\u2019t do.\u201d She also referred to Trump as \u201cthe biggest adversary internally that I think America has ever had\u201d. Lopez added: \u201cI am an actress and I like Hollywood endings and I like it when the good guy \u2013 or in this case the good girl \u2013 wins. And with an understanding of our past, and our faith in our future, I will be casting my ballot for Kamala Harris for president of the United States.\u201d Harris then entered to enthusiastic cheers and delivered a now familiar stump speech. \u201cIf he were re-elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list,\u201d she said, \u201cWhen I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list \u2026 And at the top of my list is bringing down the cost of your living. That will be my focus every single day as president.\u201d She warned of Trump\u2019s desire to sow division and chaos. She also made fun of him by remarking: \u201cYou may have seen I talked in Washington DC the other day. He likes to compare crowd sizes. I had 100,000 people there.\u201d At another point, when some in the crowd chanted \u201cLock him up! Lock him up!\u201d, Harris responded: \u201cThe courts are going to handle that. We will handle November.\u201d Earlier, the mood at Trump\u2019s rally at an ice hockey stadium in Henderson, just outside Las Vegas, was less charitable. Warm-up speakers included far-right Florida congressman Matt Gaetz and Nevada Republican chair Michael Mcdonald, who mocked Harris\u2019s laugh and derided Democrats as \u201cbeta males\u201d, claiming \u201cWe\u2019re alpha males\u201d. Big screens proclaimed \u201cBetter off with Trump\u201d and \u201cTrump will fix it!\u201d Some fans wore yellow vests to resemble garbage collectors, a reference to Joe Biden\u2019s allegedly referring to Trump supporters as \u201cgarbage\u201d. The White House has denied this. \u201cI\u2019d like to start with a very simple question: are you better off now than you were four years ago?\u201d Trump asked. \u201cNo!\u201d roared the crowd. Trump was quick to lambast his opponent. \u201cShe is the worst vice-president in the history of our country. Kamala, you\u2019re fired! Get the hell out of here. She is horrible. And she lies. Every time she gets up she tells a lie.\u201d In an election with a historic gender gap, Trump did little to win over female voters when he unveiled an ominous plan for the vaccine conspiracy theorist Robert Kennedy Jr, who abandoned his own independent candidacy to endorse him. \u201cRobert F Kennedy Jr we have and he\u2019s going to work on health and women\u2019s health and all of the different reasons, because we\u2019re not really a wealthy or a healthy country,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I told Bobby, Bobby, I want you to take care of health.\u201d The Harris campaign seized on the comment, noting that Kennedy once said he would sign a national abortion ban. But Trump\u2019s supporters seemed untroubled by the prospect. Kathy Holesapple, 56, an entrepreneur and pilot and aircraft mechanic, said of Democrats: \u201cThey\u2019ve weaponised the women against this party but the truth is that they\u2019ve also held down the women in this nation by calling us Karens. \u201cWe\u2019re not allowed to stand up and speak for our beliefs. They call us a Karen every time we speak up. So the American woman needs to stand up \u2013 and they will \u2013 and they\u2019re going to realise that Trump is for American women. He\u2019s for women all over the world.\u201d The former president predicted that he would win a record share of the Hispanic vote. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple: Hispanics want great jobs, they want rising wages and they want safe communities. They\u2019re great people. Energy \u2013 they\u2019re very entrepreneurial. I know \u2019em well, they\u2019re really hard workers, they\u2019re great people.\u201d Trump hurled insults at Harris, saying she lacked \u201cintellect\u201d or \u201cstamina\u201d, and was a \u201ctrain wreck\u201d and incapable of running a kindergarten. \u201cI\u2019ve worked for 62 days in a row \u2013 I haven\u2019t take a day off,\u201d he said, before claiming of Harris: \u201cShe\u2019s exhausted. She\u2019s finished.\u201d He heaped praise on his billionaire backer Elon Musk, stating: \u201cIn terms of computer, I would say he\u2019s probably about as good as you get.\u201d And in a bizarre riff against Democrats, Trump said: \u201cThey don\u2019t want windows. They don\u2019t want cows. They don\u2019t want anything. They don\u2019t know what they want, actually.\u201d Trump\u2019s supporters were confident of victory. Bob Diaz, 69, who is Latino and teaches computer aided drafting and design at a college, said he thinks Trump is doing \u201ca lot better\u201d among Latino voters this time. \u201cHe supports the legal way of getting into the border,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had family legally come in. In fact, my mother came in the 1940s and then she eventually became a US citizen but she did it the legal way and the right way, so that\u2019s what I support about Trump: doing it the right way.\u201d The latest New York Times/Siena poll showed Harris with 52% support among Hispanic voters to Trump\u2019s 42%. Republicans in Nevada have the edge in early voting so far but, after the Harris rally, Democrats showed a sense of urgency that Trump must be defeated. One woman stopped her car to tell strangers: \u201cTomorrow get out and tell 10 more people to vote. We can\u2019t have him back!\u201d Jinnifer Rister, 57, a professional poker player, said: \u201cHe frightens me. We need to preserve democracy in this country and the way to do that is by electing Kamala. She is the way forward. She\u2019s bringing new hope, positivity. She\u2019s what we need to do to keep this country on the right track.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Good morning. This week, the Guardian launched The Long Wave, a weekly newsletter exploring Black life and culture around the world.</p> <p>Every Wednesday, readers can expect top-tier insights, analysis, interviews, profiles, culture picks and (if you can believe it) more, delivered straight to their inbox, written by Guardian columnist Nesrine Malik and edited by Jason Okundaye.</p> <p>In the west, media coverage on the experiences of Black people, with a handful of exceptions, has focused on race and racism in fairly localised ways. Together, Nesrine and Jason however have created a unique space where Black audiences can see themselves and their stories reflected, and discover new connections <em>across</em> the diaspora, through intelligent and accessible analysis.</p> <p>The Long Wave offers a weekly dose of information, encouraging readers to spend the next seven days exploring things across the world they \u201cwould have no way of knowing about\u201d otherwise, says Nesrine. It\u2019s about connection and dialogue and fun.</p> <p>For today\u2019s newsletter, I sat down with Nesrine to discuss how The Long Wave came about, and the very personal story at the centre of it. All that, right after the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Budget</strong></em><strong> </strong>| Rachel Reeves has been warned an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/31/ifs-says-extra-9bn-of-tax-rises-may-be-needed-to-avoid-uk-public-service-cuts\">extra \u00a39bn of tax rises may be required</a> to avoid a fresh austerity drive in key public services as her record tax-raising budget sent tremors through the financial markets.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Assisted dying </strong></em>| A cross-party group of MPs<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/01/mps-medics-urge-colleagues-support-assisted-dying-bill\"> who are practising medics and former NHS staff </a>have written to MPs urging them to back the assisted dying bill, after the health secretary expressed doubt that the health service was fit to enact such a big change.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>US elections</strong></em> | <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/31/elon-musk-court-hearing-voter-lottery\">Elon Musk failed to show up to a required court appearance</a> in Philadelphia in a case challenging his $1m-a-day sweepstakes. The Philadelphia district attorney argues that Musk\u2019s offering of cash prizes to registered voters in swing states counts as illegal lottery.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Global</strong></em> | The UN has warned of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/31/almost-two-dozen-countries-at-high-risk-of-acute-hunger-un-report-reveals\">worsening food insecurity in war-stricken areas</a> such as Sudan and Palestine. A report named 22 hotspots where people are at high risk of acute hunger over the next six months, largely due to conflict and violence.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Spain</strong></em> | The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/31/spain-floods-valencia-death-toll-three-days-mourning\">death toll from devastating floods in eastern Spain</a> has risen to 158, regional authorities and emergency services have said. The country has declared three days of national mourning and the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, urged people to stay at home as more bad weather is forecast. </p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: \u2018The diaspora has become a second home for me, a place I can reach out to\u2019</h2>    <p>The Long Wave emerged from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/legacies-of-enslavement\">the Guardian\u2019s Legacies of Enslavement programme</a>, a 10-year restorative justice initiative launched last March, and evolved through months of research and development. \u201cThe Guardian has been considering for some time an editorial format that would truly serve Black audiences worldwide,\u201d says Nesrine.</p> <p>This focus aligns with the Guardian\u2019s broader commitment to global coverage of the Black experience: earlier this year, the paper appointed Natricia Duncan as its first Caribbean correspondent, brought on Eromo Egbejule and Carlos Mureithi to cover Africa and stationed Tiago Rogero in Rio de Janeiro to report on South America.</p> <p>\u201cWe recognised an underserved group of readers who weren\u2019t finding the culture, news, and analysis they wanted in mainstream media,\u201d Nesrine says.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>What does the diaspora mean to you?</strong></p> <p>Nesrine, who was born and raised in Sudan and has lived in Kenya, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, hadn\u2019t reflected deeply on what the Black diaspora meant to her personally until she began focusing on the newsletter. \u201cI realised that the diaspora had become a second home for me, a place I could reach out to \u2013 whether on social media or in real life \u2013 that made me feel grounded,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I travelled, I didn\u2019t notice until later that I was always seeking out \u2018the Black stuff\u2019 \u2013 Black food, Black music, Black culture.\u201d</p> <p>This search for familiar cultural markers was fuelled by the nostalgia and homesickness Nesrine experienced after moving to Europe in her mid-20s. \u201cI don\u2019t have a large family in the UK and I didn\u2019t migrate with anyone, so I\u2019ve often felt a bit on my own. The diaspora has made me feel far less alienated, less estranged \u2013 it made me feel like wherever I was in the world, I was kind of OK,\u201d she says.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Why a newsletter?</strong></p> <p>Once this gap was identified, Nesrine and Jason explored numerous ideas for how they could fill it. Newsletters offer freedom \u2013 unlike other mediums, they could experiment more with form and length. \u201cIt seemed like the most exciting, expansive format for us. We can feature profiles, interviews, book reviews or in-depth analysis,\u201d Nesrine says. The various sections also make it easy to spotlight events, recipes, films and discourse from around the world, tying them together in a cohesive way.</p> <p>The Long Wave will have a distinctive tone and focus compared with Nesrine\u2019s other work, including her column, she says. Newsletters create a more \u201cintimate\u201d space, fostering a \u201cdynamic conversation\u201d between writer and reader, which moves away from the top-down, distant style of reporting and column writing.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>A new offering</strong></p> <p>The Long Wave is breaking away from conventional narratives about Black communities and countries: \u201cThe media tends to focus on either crisis or boosterism,\u201d Nesrine says. In many newsrooms, space for Black stories has traditionally been limited to extremes \u2013 stories of conflict, famine or hardship dominate, balanced with hyper-positive portrayals of resilience to compensate for the glut of suffering. However, this strategy risks flattening the complexity of Black experiences worldwide.</p> <p>Nesrine concedes that \u201cyou can\u2019t capture the experience of such a vast, diverse and sometimes deeply incongruent diaspora. But all of humanity is full of these contrasts, and we share common threads.\u201d The Long Wave seeks to pull at these threads with a fresh, authentic voice and thoughtful curation of stories that reflect an expansive, nuanced view of what it means to be Black across the world.</p> <p>The Long Wave is here to bring readers perspectives they won\u2019t find elsewhere. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2024/oct/16/sign-up-for-the-long-wave-newsletter-our-weekly-black-life-and-culture-email\">Sign up here</a> to get the newsletter every Wednesday \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2024/oct/29/welcome-to-the-long-wave-nesrine-malik\">here\u2019s the very first from this week</a>, which expands on Nesrine\u2019s personal story behind The Long Wave.</p> <h2>What else we\u2019ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>It seems every news cycle introduces us to another reason to fear a Trump presidency, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/31/europe-trump-harris\">Nathalie Tocci writes lucidly</a> on what\u2019s at stake for <strong>Europe</strong> in next week\u2019s US election.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. This week, the Guardian launched The Long Wave, a weekly newsletter exploring Black life and culture around the world. Every Wednesday, readers can expect top-tier insights, analysis, interviews, profiles, culture picks and (if you can believe it) more, delivered straight to their inbox, written by Guardian columnist Nesrine Malik and edited by Jason Okundaye. In the west, media coverage on the experiences of Black people, with a handful of exceptions, has focused on race and racism in fairly localised ways. Together, Nesrine and Jason however have created a unique space where Black audiences can see themselves and their stories reflected, and discover new connections across the diaspora, through intelligent and accessible analysis. The Long Wave offers a weekly dose of information, encouraging readers to spend the next seven days exploring things across the world they \u201cwould have no way of knowing about\u201d otherwise, says Nesrine. It\u2019s about connection and dialogue and fun. For today\u2019s newsletter, I sat down with Nesrine to discuss how The Long Wave came about, and the very personal story at the centre of it. All that, right after the headlines. Five big stories Budget | Rachel Reeves has been warned an extra \u00a39bn of tax rises may be required to avoid a fresh austerity drive in key public services as her record tax-raising budget sent tremors through the financial markets. Assisted dying | A cross-party group of MPs who are practising medics and former NHS staff have written to MPs urging them to back the assisted dying bill, after the health secretary expressed doubt that the health service was fit to enact such a big change. US elections | Elon Musk failed to show up to a required court appearance in Philadelphia in a case challenging his $1m-a-day sweepstakes. The Philadelphia district attorney argues that Musk\u2019s offering of cash prizes to registered voters in swing states counts as illegal lottery. Global | The UN has warned of worsening food insecurity in war-stricken areas such as Sudan and Palestine. A report named 22 hotspots where people are at high risk of acute hunger over the next six months, largely due to conflict and violence. Spain | The death toll from devastating floods in eastern Spain has risen to 158, regional authorities and emergency services have said. The country has declared three days of national mourning and the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, urged people to stay at home as more bad weather is forecast. In depth: \u2018The diaspora has become a second home for me, a place I can reach out to\u2019 The Long Wave emerged from the Guardian\u2019s Legacies of Enslavement programme, a 10-year restorative justice initiative launched last March, and evolved through months of research and development. \u201cThe Guardian has been considering for some time an editorial format that would truly serve Black audiences worldwide,\u201d says Nesrine. This focus aligns with the Guardian\u2019s broader commitment to global coverage of the Black experience: earlier this year, the paper appointed Natricia Duncan as its first Caribbean correspondent, brought on Eromo Egbejule and Carlos Mureithi to cover Africa and stationed Tiago Rogero in Rio de Janeiro to report on South America. \u201cWe recognised an underserved group of readers who weren\u2019t finding the culture, news, and analysis they wanted in mainstream media,\u201d Nesrine says. *** What does the diaspora mean to you? Nesrine, who was born and raised in Sudan and has lived in Kenya, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, hadn\u2019t reflected deeply on what the Black diaspora meant to her personally until she began focusing on the newsletter. \u201cI realised that the diaspora had become a second home for me, a place I could reach out to \u2013 whether on social media or in real life \u2013 that made me feel grounded,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I travelled, I didn\u2019t notice until later that I was always seeking out \u2018the Black stuff\u2019 \u2013 Black food, Black music, Black culture.\u201d This search for familiar cultural markers was fuelled by the nostalgia and homesickness Nesrine experienced after moving to Europe in her mid-20s. \u201cI don\u2019t have a large family in the UK and I didn\u2019t migrate with anyone, so I\u2019ve often felt a bit on my own. The diaspora has made me feel far less alienated, less estranged \u2013 it made me feel like wherever I was in the world, I was kind of OK,\u201d she says. *** Why a newsletter? Once this gap was identified, Nesrine and Jason explored numerous ideas for how they could fill it. Newsletters offer freedom \u2013 unlike other mediums, they could experiment more with form and length. \u201cIt seemed like the most exciting, expansive format for us. We can feature profiles, interviews, book reviews or in-depth analysis,\u201d Nesrine says. The various sections also make it easy to spotlight events, recipes, films and discourse from around the world, tying them together in a cohesive way. The Long Wave will have a distinctive tone and focus compared with Nesrine\u2019s other work, including her column, she says. Newsletters create a more \u201cintimate\u201d space, fostering a \u201cdynamic conversation\u201d between writer and reader, which moves away from the top-down, distant style of reporting and column writing. *** A new offering The Long Wave is breaking away from conventional narratives about Black communities and countries: \u201cThe media tends to focus on either crisis or boosterism,\u201d Nesrine says. In many newsrooms, space for Black stories has traditionally been limited to extremes \u2013 stories of conflict, famine or hardship dominate, balanced with hyper-positive portrayals of resilience to compensate for the glut of suffering. However, this strategy risks flattening the complexity of Black experiences worldwide. Nesrine concedes that \u201cyou can\u2019t capture the experience of such a vast, diverse and sometimes deeply incongruent diaspora. But all of humanity is full of these contrasts, and we share common threads.\u201d The Long Wave seeks to pull at these threads with a fresh, authentic voice and thoughtful curation of stories that reflect an expansive, nuanced view of what it means to be Black across the world. The Long Wave is here to bring readers perspectives they won\u2019t find elsewhere. Sign up here to get the newsletter every Wednesday \u2013 and here\u2019s the very first from this week, which expands on Nesrine\u2019s personal story behind The Long Wave. What else we\u2019ve been reading It seems every news cycle introduces us to another reason to fear a Trump presidency, but Nathalie Tocci writes lucidly on what\u2019s at stake for Europe in next week\u2019s US election. While a win for Harris would be a boon for liberal democrats, a Trump win would only accelerate the \u201cOrb\u00e1nisation\u201d of Europe, she writes. Charlie Lindlar, acting deputy editor, newsletters Sending emails at all hours of the day is bad \u2013 not just for your mental health but for the environment too.

It is also targeting winning another major tournament within the next four years, after the England women\u2019s team won Euro 2022 and reached last year\u2019s World Cup final. Cricket | A new-look England have fallen to a crushing defeat in the first match of their Caribbean tour, as the West Indies secured an eight-wicket victory in Antigua with 55 balls to spare.

      "bodyText": "The Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, has said a video that claimed to show a Haitian immigrant who voted multiple times is \u201cfalse\u201d, \u201ctargeted disinformation\u201d and likely the work of a Russian troll farm. \u201cAs Americans we can\u2019t let our enemies use lies to divide us,\u201d said Raffensperger, who also asked that \u201cElon Musk and the leadership of other social media platforms \u2026 take this down.\u201d Meanwhile, Musk has deputised his followers on X to spot and report any \u201cpotential instances of voter fraud and irregularities\u201d. The election integrity community he spawned is rife with unfounded claims passed off as evidence of voter fraud. As Americans race towards the presidential election, claims of voter fraud \u2013 as well as real example of political violence \u2013 are growing, with burning vote boxes, attempts to steal ballots and online hoaxes all reported this week. Here is what else happened on Thursday: Kamala Harris election news and updates Kamala Harris said on Thursday that Donald Trump\u2019s comment that he would protect women \u201cwhether the women like it or not\u201d showed that the Republican presidential nominee does not understand women\u2019s \u201cagency, their authority, their right and their ability to make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies\u201d. Harris, who has been receiving a slew of celebrity endorsements, got an A-list boost from pop star and movie actor Jennifer Lopez in Las Vegas, after basketball great LeBron James endorsed her earlier in the day. \u201cI like Hollywood endings. I like when the good guy, or in this case the good girl wins,\u201d said Lopez. The cast of Marvel\u2019s Avengers movies also came out in support of Harris. In a video posted first on Vanity Fair, actors Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Don Cheadle, Chris Evans, Danai Gurira and Paul Bettany playfully riffed on their respective characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe while encouraging viewers to vote for Harris. Donald Trump election news and updates Trump acknowledged that Elon Musk and Robert F Kennedy Jr could be \u201cinfluential figures\u201d in a potential second administration as he sat for a lengthy interview with conservative broadcaster Tucker Carlson in battleground state Arizona. Trump also called Liz Cheney a \u201cwar hawk\u201d who should be placed in the line of fire to \u201csee how she feels about it\u201d. The former congresswoman has become one of his most prominent Republican critics. Trump made stops in New Mexico, a traditionally Democratic state, and the swing state of Nevada. Trump predicted he would defy experts who said campaigning in New Mexico was futile. \u201cThey all said \u2018Don\u2019t come. You can\u2019t win New Mexico.\u2019 I said, \u2018Look, your votes are rigged. We can win New Mexico,\u2019\u201d Trump said. Trump\u2019s refusal to publicly acknowledge his defeat in 2020 and suggestion that if he loses this year, he will once again claim fraud, have changed the lives of many formerly low-key election offices and secretaries of state nationwide, who now regularly face threats and harassment, Chris Stein reported from Arizona. Elon Musk failed to show up to a required hearing in a Philadelphia case challenging his $1m-a-day sweepstakes. His absence would have risked contempt of court had the case continued in Pennsylvania court, but it was moved to federal court in response to a motion filed by Musk\u2019s attorneys, who did attend the hearing. No hearings were immediately scheduled in the federal case. Musk\u2019s get-out-the-vote effort for Donald Trump has come under renewed scrutiny after paid canvassers reported not knowing beforehand that they were being hired to support the former president. Workers recruited by Musk\u2019s America Pac to canvass in the battleground state of Michigan only discovered they were working for the Space X and Tesla entrepreneur to drum up voter turnout for Trump after signing non-disclosure agreements, Wired reported. Elsewhere on the campaign trail Practising witches from around the world gathered in Salem by the hundreds on Thursday night to honour Stormy Daniels at their annual \u201cmagic circle\u201d ceremony recognising loved ones who have died. Daniels \u2013 the adult film actor who allegedly had an affair with Trump and was at the centre of his May criminal trial that led to the former president\u2019s conviction on 34 felonies \u2013 was chosen to be honoured in the Halloween ceremony as the organisers believe that she has been the victim of a modern-day witch-hunt. White House press officials altered the official transcript of a call in which President Joe Biden appeared to take a swipe at supporters of Donald Trump, drawing objections from the federal workers who document such remarks for posterity, according to two US government officials and an internal email obtained on Thursday by the Associated Press.

As is often the case when it comes to words of the year, expressions popularised by social media featured heavily on the list. \u201cYapping\u201d \u2013 ie talking too much \u2013 has become a popular term on TikTok, as has \u201clooksmaxxing\u201d, defined by Collins as \u201cattempting to maximise the attractiveness of one\u2019s physical appearance\u201d. \u201cDelulu\u201d, slang for deluded, is another word known for its social media usage, along with \u201crawdogging\u201d, which originally emerged as slang for sex without a condom, but is now more widely used as a term for doing something \u2013 most commonly taking a flight or train journey \u2013 without entertainment or assistance. Meanwhile \u201cbrainrot\u201d, \u201can inability to think clearly caused by excessive consumption of low-quality online content\u201d, has also made the top 10. Completing the list are \u201canti-tourism\u201d \u2013 the opposition of large-scale tourism \u2013 and \u201cromantasy\u201d, a steamy subgenre of fantasy that has become hugely popular in recent years via authors such as Sarah J Maas and Rebecca Yarros. Alex Beecroft, managing director of Collins, said that \u201cwhile \u2018supermajority\u2019 does the heavy lifting in a year of political upheaval in the UK and around the world, the big disruptors in language have come from different sources. With many of this year\u2019s notable words being popularised by generations Z and Alpha, we can confidently say this is the most \u2018brat\u2019 word of the year list ever!\u201d Collins dictionary monitors its 20bn-word database along with a range of media sources to create an annual list that aims to \u201creflect our ever-evolving language and the preoccupations of those who use it\u201d. The words on the list tend to be a mixture of completely new words and existing terms that have been particularly notable that year \u2013 \u201clockdown\u201d was the word of the year in 2020, for example \u2013 or ones that have developed additional meanings, such as brat. Last year\u2019s word of the year was AI.",

But now the William Morris Gallery \u2013 housed in the 19th-century writer and artist\u2019s former home \u2013 is appealing to the public to send them all manner of artefacts adorned with his distinctive designs for a major new exhibition. Morris\u2019s patterns are having something of a moment. \u201cYou walk down the high street and if you get your eye in you can see Morris patterns everywhere: iPhone cases, umbrellas, shopping trolleys,\u201d said Hadrian Garrard, the director of the gallery in Walthamstow, east London. He wants hundreds of \u201cweird and wonderful\u201d items to fill the Morris Mania exhibition, in order to create an \u201cimmersive Morris environment\u201d. The exhibition will be at the centre of the gallery\u2019s 75th anniversary celebrations and will open in April 2025. \u201cWe\u2019re exploring how Britain\u2019s greatest designer went viral \u2013 it\u2019s Morris everywhere, Morris on everything,\u201d Garrard said. Morris is best known for textile designs that took inspiration from nature, but he is also known for his socialism and belief that good design can improve people\u2019s lives. He is widely regarded as the father of the Arts and Crafts movement. The recent popularity of his designs is at the heart of a paradox the show will explore, according to Garrard. Morris was famous for his defence of workers\u2019 rights, belief that good design should be for everyone and \u201cutopian plans to cut working hours\u201d, but those ideals could sometimes be in opposition. Garrard said: \u201cHe wanted his designs to be affordable but in his lifetime they were too expensive; they were for the upper middle classes because he wanted things to be made well. \u201cBut we now see it democratised to the point where you can buy an iPhone case for \u00a35.99 or a pair of trainers, but the way those things are made is really complicated because we\u2019re talking about globalised economy, mass production and poor working conditions. The show \u2013 in a fun way \u2013 is looking at the paradox and wondering how we got there.\u201d Alongside the public donations, which Garrard said would either be returned to the owners or be given to local charity shops in the Waltham Forest area after the exhibition closed, the gallery has also been collecting assorted \u201coddities\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve just bought a Japanese waving cat, we\u2019ve also got a sari that\u2019s been made by a company in Delhi, we\u2019ve got a seat from British nuclear submarine fleet \u2013 they used to deck the subs out in Morris print,\u201d said Garrard. \u201cThere\u2019s a photograph of the Winter Palace in 1917 after it\u2019s been smashed up by the Bolsheviks and in the background is the William Morris tulip wallpaper. \u201cHe famously said \u2018have nothing in your house that you do not believe to be beautiful or useful\u2019 and there are many funny things that is written on: a tape measure, weird chopping boards, a bottle opener.

Artists such as Kehinde Wiley have spoken about his influence, while the Guardian argued in 2022 that \u201chis socialism and care for the environment are as urgent now as they were in the late 19th century\u201d. The William Morris Gallery is undergoing refurbishment, following in the footsteps of Morris\u2019s former home in Oxfordshire, which was transformed by a \u00a36m renovation project and reopened to the public in 2022.

      "body": "<p>Rachel Reeves is the third Labour chancellor of the exchequer to be an MP in my home city. In earlier times, Hugh Gaitskell and Denis Healey both sat for Leeds seats too, as Reeves does today. Their budgets, like hers this week, were delivered in challenging, though extremely different, economic times.</p> \n<p>Both these Labour predecessors, however, would unhesitatingly have recognised Reeves\u2019s 2024 budget as what it is. It is a budget in the identifiably social democratic Labour tradition to which Gaitskell and Healey also belonged. It is a tradition qualitatively different from that of even the most progressive Conservative chancellor.</p> \n<p>Reeves this week delivered a budget centred on the funding of public services after years of austerity under George Osborne and years of extra borrowing under Osborne and his successors, not least during the pandemic under Rishi Sunak. It is a budget willing to raise taxes and to increase borrowing, rather than to promise national wealth through tax cuts. It is one that looks to the state to promote growth, extend investment and support living standards, rather than looking to it to move out of the way to achieve those ends.</p> \n<p>Whether Reeves was correct to do any of these things or not is a matter for debate and for the proving ground of history. What cannot be disputed is that it is a radically different approach from what came before. As Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies put it on Thursday, the budget involved \u201cbig choices\u201d and \u201ca change of policy direction\u201d.</p> \n<p>So let us clear one potential distraction out of the way at the start of deciding where Reeves\u2019s budget will leave the country and the Labour government. Those who claim there is no essential difference between Labour\u2019s approach and that of the Conservatives are simply wrong. That\u2019s not a matter of interpretation or opinion. It\u2019s simply a fact.</p> \n<p>Clearly, though, that is not the end of the matter. As ever, the practical questions are the ones that really matter. Will Reeves\u2019s budget do what it claims and intends, either economically or politically? Will it help to grow the economy and support living standards better? And will it win the public\u2019s backing as the electoral cycle unfolds? Here, the answers are much less clearcut.</p> \n<p>The most striking thing about the budget\u2019s economic projections is that they contain so little evidence of sustained growth. In opposition and during the election, Reeves consistently characterised the British economy as suffering from one thing above all: a growth crisis. If you believe the OBR forecasts, though, there will still be a growth crisis in four years\u2019 time. Growth will peak at <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yge6knpzdo\">2% in 2025</a> and then drop back to 1.5% as the 2028-29 general election nears. An anaemic outturn of that kind could spell economic and political failure, not success.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ab0d4fe2-064a-4e26-8520-1835887a8768\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iIUffopxwtc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Perhaps the figures cannot be trusted, as Johnson seems to feel. \u201cThe same silly games playing as we got used to with the last lot,\u201d he dubs it exasperatedly. Perhaps growth will come through other routes. Planning reform could unleash more housebuilding and infrastructure construction. Once the details are clearer, Reeves\u2019s new industrial strategy may stimulate further growth in new industries and small and medium enterprises. The much-vaunted post-Brexit reset with the EU may help boost trade and competition. Perhaps. Or perhaps not.</p> \n<p>A change of direction it undoubtedly is. But that is not the same as a safe arrival in a different place. A century after the ousting of the first Labour government in 1924, this is a theme that runs through the party\u2019s history. It is a big theme with a big lesson. Those who wish to arrive in a radically changed and more social democratic Britain, as Reeves does and Labour does, must provide enough of the public with enough reasons to stay the course, especially when things get hard. Gaitskell and Healey would discover the perils of not doing that.</p> \n<p>This is where Labour is also getting it wrong in 2024, both during and since the election. Before July, Reeves clearly knew that she would need to deliver a new settlement of the kind she did this week. Yet Labour was also fixated on not allowing the media to scare voters with the prospect of raised taxes. The result was a disjunctive message \u2013 we will bring big change for the country without big change for you. The election result was perhaps a vindication of that ambiguity. But it has left Labour with very shallow reserves of longer-term credibility.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/31/rachel-reeves-labour-budget-willing-spend-two-dangers\">At last, a government willing to spend \u2013 but this budget will expose it to two great dangers | Aditya Chakrabortty</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Successful governments need to give themselves elbow room.

An alarm was triggered but the handler didn\u2019t hear it. \u201cUnfortunately there was an alarm that goes off, it did go off \u2026 but when police went down there it was too late,\u201d the assistant commissioner Stephen Hegarty told reporters. \u201cThe primary cooling source would be the air conditioner, unfortunately when we returned to the motor vehicle it had ceased [running], which meant the air conditioner ceased as well.\u201d The \u201cstate of the art\u201d cooling pod features were introduced in 2023. The temperature reached 27C in Lucas Heights on Thursday. There is no protocol stipulating how often dogs are checked inside the pods. Police did not believe the car ran out of fuel. \u201cThose dogs can be in the rear of the car at night-time for long periods of time, so it\u2019s not unusual and [not] against any \u2026 processes or training we\u2019ve given the officers,\u201d Hegarty said. Changes have been implemented while the investigation was under way, the force said. They include increased use of kennelling and more frequent inspections of dogs kept in cooling pods. The NSW police commissioner, Karen Webb, said she was \u201cconfident\u201d there was no human error involved. \u201cThey were in specialist-designed pods,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m confident there had been no human error and the vehicle has been towed for examination to check for any mechanical, technical and engineering issues.\u201d Webb earlier on Friday told ABC radio the dogs were \u201ctwo valuable members of our organisation\u201d. \u201cThe thoughts of the whole police family are with them. We owe it to PD Xtra and DD Soldier to conduct a thorough investigation.\u201d The dogs\u2019 handler was devastated, the commissioner told reporters on Friday. \u201cHe had the very difficult task of going home yesterday afternoon to inform his wife and his two children about the passing of the two dogs because the two dogs \u2026 reside with the family,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are part of that family [and] with the officer 24/7.\u201d Xtra had been with NSW police since 2018. Soldier was 15 months old and started working with the force in February 2024 for training and development. A memorial was to be held for the dogs at a later date and they would be added to the police wall of remembrance.",

Since we began our Women Press Freedom project, I and my colleagues at the Coalition for Women in Journalism have received a lot of messages of concern about the safety of female journalists all over the world, but I vividly remember the pain and terror that peppered the SOS calls from Roshchyna\u2019s friends and colleagues.

The next news we heard about Roshchyna was an announcement by officials in Kyiv that she had died in Russian detention, reportedly while being transferred to Moscow from a prison in Taganrog as part of a prisoner swap. Since then, Russia\u2019s apparent refusal to hand over her body to Ukrainian authorities has hampered any kind of investigation into how or why this happened, leaving her family with no answers about what ended the life of this young woman. Roshchyna is the ninth female journalist to die as a result of doing their job since Russia invaded in February 2022, victims of what we consider a campaign of violence and intimidation perpetrated on women covering the war in Ukraine. This war on female journalists is also apparent in our monitoring of ongoing arrests and abductions by the Russian state. In the past five years, aside from Roshchyna, we have documented 64 cases of female journalists being detained by Russia, either within the country or in occupied territories. Since 2022, 11 have been abducted, many of them from their homes. Russia is also one of the top culprits in a growing trend of transnational repression of journalists, targeting women in foreign states in eight of 71 incidents recorded across 21 countries. We have observed that Russia keeps a tab on journalists\u2019 whereabouts, not only within its borders but also across Europe and other parts of the world. We know of three women in exile in Europe who were targeted in suspected poisonings. Through our work trying to secure the freedom of female journalists in Russian detention, we have heard reports of the brutal conditions that they or their lawyers say they are facing behind bars, including beatings and torture. One woman we have been trying to help free is a Crimean citizen journalist, Irinia Danilovich, who was abducted from the Russian-occupied territory in 2022 while investigating corruption in the healthcare system. Danilovich suffered hearing loss and acute ear pain in detention but did not receive the medical care she needed and was not well enough to attend her own court hearing. In late September we collaborated with Zmina, a Ukraine-based organisation, to raise awareness about Danilovich\u2019s case, and have urged the international community to join us in forcing Russia to drop charges against her and release her immediately. It should be a well understood fact for all governments, whether Russia or any other violators, that the safety and wellbeing of a journalist arrested or detained is the responsibility of the state or authorities who take them into custody. These journalists are witnesses on behalf of the public that these states claim to be governing. Making Russia, or other violators, accountable will not be possible without a dedicated effort by international bodies to push against impunity. In the past few years we have witnessed an increasing number of female journalists in other countries such as Iran, China and Turkey being put behind bars under bogus charges and being denied access to lawyers and medical care. The nightmarish treatment they receive in detention includes torture and physical and sexual assault. International human rights bodies and democratic governments need to urgently unite to protect journalists beyond verbal condemnation and warnings.

The ICC reparations order \u2013 the largest in the court\u2019s history \u2013 was issued after a 2021 ruling in which the court found Ongwen, a former commander of the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army militia group, guilty of various war crimes committed between 2002 and 2005, including murder, torture, sexual enslavement, the conscription of children into hostilities, and brutal attacks on four camps for internally displaced people in northern Uganda.

      "body": "<p>Margaret Moth and Lucy Lawless: the names alone, alliterative and faintly fantastical, suggest larger-than-life superheroes. That isn\u2019t too far from the truth. Moth, born Margaret Wilson in Gisborne, New Zealand in 1951, transformed herself into the woman she wanted to be. She cast off the blond cherubic sweetness of her childhood, adopted an all-black look from the tips of her punky hairdo to her combat boots, named herself after the insect that she most feared, and went to court to fight for her legal right to be sterilised. (\u201cI\u2019m not a breeder,\u201d she said.) She went on to become an intrepid news camerawoman who sought out ever more dangerous assignments, and didn\u2019t run for cover when she got there. On the West Bank, she was shot in the foot by an Israeli soldier. In Sarajevo, a sniper\u2019s bullet destroyed her lower jaw. Only in a war zone, a colleague once observed, did she truly know who she was.</p> <p>Now Lawless, a fellow New Zealander best known for playing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/article/2024/jul/01/how-we-made-xena-warrior-princess-gabrielle-lucy-lawless-renee-oconnnor\">Xena: Warrior Princess</a> in the 1990s fantasy action series of the same name, has made her directorial debut with Never Look Away, a documentary about Moth, who died in 2010. The 56-year-old actor turned director could see the headlines before she had shot a frame of footage. \u201c\u2018Warrior Princess on TV meets Warrior Princess in real life!\u2019\u201d she says, leaning across the table in a busy London cafe to make herself heard over the din. \u201cLooks good in print, right? Even down to the \u2018MM\u2019 and \u2018LL\u2019 of it.\u201d</p>    <p>There are other superficial similarities. Both women took on new names (Lawless still goes by her first husband\u2019s surname) and dyed their hair. The actor, whose natural colour is mousey blond, went Moth-black to play Xena. \u201cOh yeah!\u201d she says, the coincidence only just hitting her. \u201cIt was the 1990s. That whole <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jun/16/gender.uk\">Gabriela Sabatini </a>thing.\u201d</p> <p>But she dismisses any deeper connection with Moth. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much in common,\u201d she sniffs. \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by the name. I\u2019m not a bad girl.\u201d Doesn\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/jun/30/lucy-lawless-xena-ecowarrior-protest\">occupying a docked Shell vessel for three days</a> with six fellow Greenpeace activists to protest against drilling in the Arctic, as Lawless did in New Zealand in 2012, count for anything? \u201cYeah, but I\u2019m an idealist. Margaret absolutely was not. She eschewed any kind of spirituality. Introspection was all woo-woo to her. Her attitude was: \u2018Self-exploration? No thank you!\u2019 The only way we\u2019re the same is that curiosity can be more attractive to us than common sense.\u201d</p>    <p>She narrowly avoided prison time for her part in the Greenpeace protest, escaping with a fine and 120 hours of community service. Even that is shrugged off when I mention it now. \u201cI broke the law knowingly. I knew the ramifications.\u201d Like Moth, Lawless also has a track record for championing the oppressed and disfranchised. She was overjoyed when Xena: Warrior Princess was embraced by LGBTQ+ viewers because of Xena\u2019s relationship with her companion, Gabrielle (Renee O\u2019Connor), which was ambiguous then but which has since been confirmed by Lawless. \u201cI was like, \u2018That\u2019s so cool!\u2019 I was also a bit flummoxed. This was an acting gig where I got paid and it was fun but I didn\u2019t really think about the effect on the audience at the time. Now I see that\u2019s the alchemy of a show like Xena. A marginalised community can see it, relate to it and be inspired.\u201d She calls it \u201ca fascinating sociological event\u201d.</p> <p>It is for that reason that she looked uncomfortable while hosting Saturday Night Live in 1998, where cast members including Tina Fey joked about the show\u2019s popularity among lesbian viewers. \u201cIt\u2019s cringey,\u201d Lawless admits. \u201cUgly, stupid stuff.\u201d What was she thinking when Fey, dressed as a butch admirer, asked her out for a beer and a game of pool during <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugoban_xwgI\">her opening monologue</a>? \u201cI was looking for more. Like, \u2018Is <em>that </em>the joke?\u2019 You don\u2019t crap on the fans. It was Bill Shatner who said to me, \u2018Stick with the fans and they\u2019ll stick with you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She seems far happier talking about Never Look Away, which came to her via her producer husband, Robert Tapert, co-creator of Xena: Warrior Princess. Turning down the project when it was brought to him by a friend of Moth\u2019s, he instead suggested his wife, who had never even thought about directing. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose this,\u201d she says gravely. \u201cThe story chose <em>me</em>. I started making all these rash promises about how I could raise the money, promises I had no business making. I was possessed by Margaret!\u201d</p>    <p>Like its subject, Never Look Away hits the ground running. In the first few minutes, we learn that Moth took acid most weekends, threw herself into skydiving and rollerblading, and slept with much younger men. One of those, the late Jeff Russi, reminisces fondly in the film about his polyamorous relationship with her, which began when she was 30 and he was a high-school student of 17 working at a pizza joint in her neighbourhood. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to soft-pedal that stuff so I put it right up front,\u201d says Lawless. \u201cThat\u2019s the least of it with Margaret. It\u2019s like, \u2018You think that\u2019s bad? Now shit\u2019s gonna get <em>really</em> crazy.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The film never passes judgment on its subject\u2019s private life. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to convey any attitude about her drug habits or her sexual proclivities. Margaret was supremely non-judgmental herself. My hope is that people will leave the cinema discussing and disagreeing about who it was that they just spent 90 minutes with.\u201d There is never any doubt, though, that Moth is rendered heroic by her determination to expose injustice and atrocity. As Lawless puts it: \u201cShe was a bad girl who walked on the side of the angels.\u201d</p> <p>Descriptions of her tend to be variations on a theme. Russi calls her \u201cthe lion-tamer\u201d and \u201cthe queen of the night\u201d. Others describe her as \u201cfearless\u201d, \u201cballsy\u201d and \u201ckick-ass\u201d. One of her mottoes was \u201cNo regrets\u201d; another was \u201cDon\u2019t be boring\u201d. And she wasn\u2019t. Having become the first news camerawoman in her native country in the 1970s, she moved to the US in 1980 and was eventually hired by CNN. She found herself \u2013 in both senses of that phrase \u2013 in Kuwait during the first Gulf war in 1990, where she smoked cigars with the US General Norman Schwartzkopf.</p> <p>Her cataclysmic injury in Sarajevo occurred just two years later. A medic said the damage was so severe that it would probably be better if she died. But that wasn\u2019t Moth\u2019s style. Instead, she joked about going back to Sarajevo to look for her teeth.</p> <p>It is here that the title of Lawless\u2019s film acquires its second meaning. Not much footage exists of Moth before the shooting (\u201cWho wants to interview a camerawoman?\u201d reasons Lawless), whereas the documentary draws on interviews with her after surgery. She dabs away the drool as she speaks, her slurred delivery making it difficult for her to be understood even by her closest colleagues. It feels as if Lawless is daring <em>us</em> to look away, forcing the audience to face the traumas in Moth\u2019s life, and not merely the badass swagger.</p>    <p>Not that she lost that either. Though CNN wanted to restrict her to safer assignments, she refused. As her colleague Stefano Kotsonis says in the film: \u201cShe didn\u2019t do less war after she was shot. She did more. She doubled down on danger.\u201d</p> <p>When her number really was up, she was disappointed that it was cancer. \u201cI would have liked to think I\u2019d have gone out with a bit more flair,\u201d she said, a year before her death at the age of 58.</p> <p>Even after making Never Look Away, Lawless doesn\u2019t feel she has fully unpicked the enigma of Margaret Moth, and what drove her. \u201cPeople call her \u2018dangerously authentic\u2019, but here she is creating this false persona. She\u2019s very hard to quantify. She\u2019s still a real mystery to me in some ways.\u201d Some interviewees mention the sense of a deep anger within her. There is testimony in the film from Moth\u2019s siblings about the violence meted out to all of them by their mother, whose eyes would turn black \u201clike a demon\u201d when she set about them with belts, hairbrushes and leather shaving strops.</p> <p>\u201cI was always looking for what Margaret was fighting against,\u201d Lawless says. \u201cYou want to jump to the easy but terrifying conclusion that she was sexually abused as a child. But she absolutely was not.\u201d The physical abuse sounds harrowing enough. \u201cYeah, her siblings think it was discipline, but it\u2019s violence without a doubt. What there was in that family was this relentless dearth of love. And it was this that became Margaret\u2019s superpower.\u201d</p>    <p>The woman who emerged from that punishing childhood was unsentimental but never unfeeling. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want children,\u201d Lawless says. \u201cBut, in the end, she found her children. They were the children of war, and she lived for them. When all the beauty and the sex and the drugs and the punk music was gone, and the roller-skating and the skydiving was gone, there was only telling the story of the children. That was all she cared about. Margaret\u2019s purpose was to represent the non-combatants of war. Unfortunately, she was the first in a wave of what has now become de rigueur, which is shooting the messenger \u2013 literally.\u201d</p> <p>With leaders like Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin undermining the authority of the press, the documentary feels both urgent and pertinent. \u201cI want it to bring honour back to the profession of news-gathering,\u201d she says. \u201cEverybody\u2019s dumping on mainstream media and people don\u2019t believe anything they see.\u201d</p> <p>Lawless surely doesn\u2019t intend for audiences to follow in Moth\u2019s footsteps in any literal sense. Few of us, if the bombs were falling, would scramble on to the roof to get a better look, as Moth did. So what does she hope viewers will take from Never Look Away? \u201cI want people to realise that the thing you most desire, your unexplored potential, is <em>only just</em> out of reach, and if you reach a little higher you can have it. That\u2019s the movie\u2019s message: reach a little higher.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Never Look Away is in UK cinemas from 2 December. </p>",

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email A Canva spokesperson said the company complied fully with tax laws and regulations, paying millions each year in payroll tax, fringe benefits tax and other contributions. \u201cOur focus on R&amp;D not only drives innovation and job creation here in Australia but also qualifies us for the government\u2019s R&amp;D tax incentive, which helps reduce our income tax payable so we can reinvest even more in innovation,\u201d the spokesperson said. The report makes clear that there are legitimate reasons why some companies might not pay income tax. When a corporate entity has deductions that exceed its income, it may incur a tax loss that it can use in future years. This can occur when a company is under pressure, or expanding rapidly, which often happens when resources companies are building projects. Some large businesses also have multiple entities that use transfer agreements to charge other divisions, which can reduce the amount of tax they pay in the jurisdiction where the money is earned. Under pressure mining and services company, Mineral Resources, generated $5.64bn in income in 2022-23, but had a zero tax bill. A company spokesperson said MinRes indirectly paid $240.8m in income tax through its 50% interest in the entity that owns the Mt Marion lithium mine. The entity paid a franking credit that MinRes used to reduce its cash tax, the spokesperson said. Online retailer Kogan did not pay income tax in 2022-23.

Domino\u2019s Pizza Enterprises did not have a tax bill in the 2023 financial year despite recording $704m in income. A Domino\u2019s spokesperson said the company paid $171m of income tax in the five years leading up to 2023. The earnings reduction in 2023, and reduction in tax, was largely attributed to a change in trading conditions in Asia, high inflation, and costs linked to restructuring the business, the representative said. \u201cAs Domino\u2019s moves towards more consistent trading conditions, it will become tax payable again,\u201d the spokesperson said. All companies in this story were contacted for comment. The ATO report found that 31% of large businesses reported nil tax paid, representing 1,253 entities, which was slightly down on previous years.

The costs covered police coverage, barricades and other expenses. Trump is banned from rallying in the city over the unpaid bill \u2013 his event is being held instead at a private hangar owned by CSI Aviation near the Albuquerque international sunport.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Billionaires have flushed the election with cash \u2013 roughly $1.9b to be exact, largely to the benefit of republican candidates like Trump. </strong>\u201cBillionaire campaign spending on this scale drowns out the voices and concerns of ordinary Americans. It is one of the most obvious and disturbing consequences of the growth of billionaire fortunes, as well as being a prime indicator that the system regulating campaign finance has collapsed,\u201d said David Kass, ATF\u2019s executive director.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Voter enthusiasm is at a historical high for a presidential election, a Gallup poll found.</strong> Similar to November 2020, 70% of registered voters nationwide said that they were more enthusiastic than usual about voting now compared to March, when only 56% expressed enthusiasm.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Trump\u2019s former attorney <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/31/trump-lawyer-kenneth-chesebro-suspended\">Kenneth Chesebro</a> has been suspended from practicing law in New York.</strong> Chesboro was indicted on state racketeering and conspiracy charges over efforts to overturn Trump\u2019s defeat in the 2020 election in Georgia.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Harris has received more endorsements today</strong>.

Users posting on the self-contained feed, the \u201celection integrity community\u201d, quickly began pointing out what they deemed as evidence of fraud and election interference.</p> \n  <p>Tweets showing everything from ballots that arrived ripped, an ABC news system test, a postal worker doing his job and dropping off mail-in ballots were all presented as evidence that the upcoming presidential election had been compromised. Some users posted videos of individuals they deemed suspicious, despite providing little or no proof of suspicious activity and asked others in the community to help identify them.</p> \n  <p>Among the tweets are attempts at doxxing and identifying people who users falsely accuse of ballot box stuffing or preventing Trump supporters from voting. In one case, a post with 14,000 shares and 31,000 likes includes a video of a postal worker bringing ballots into a polling location in Northampton county, Pennsylvania.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/31/elon-musk-election-integrity-community-misinformation-disinformation\">Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018election integrity community\u2019 on X is full of baseless claims</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6723f9258f0821d89821dfe9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-31T21:41:42.873Z\">9.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Los Angeles Lakers star <strong>LeBron James</strong> has endorsed Kamala Harris, writing: \u201cWhen I think about my kids and my family and how they will grow up, the choice is clear to me.\u201d</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KingJames/status/1852093996350275595\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What are we even talking about here??&nbsp;When I think about my kids and my family and how they will grow up, the choice is clear to me.&nbsp;VOTE KAMALA HARRIS!!! <a href=\"https://t.co/tYYlTmQS6e\">pic.twitter.com/tYYlTmQS6e</a></p>\u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KingJames/status/1852093996350275595?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 31, 2024</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The endorsement isn\u2019t a surprise \u2013 James has supported Democrats before, and been critical of Donald Trump.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-31T21:42:29.819Z\">at 9.42pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6723f4d48f086f851f5705ce\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/davidsmith\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-31T21:21:57.990Z\">9.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Supporters of Donald Trump, gathering for a campaign rally in Henderson, near Las Vegas in Nevada, are confident that he will win next week\u2019s presidential election \u2013 and some refuse to contemplate defeat.</strong></p> \n  <p>Bob Diaz, 69, who is Latino and teaches at a college, said Trump is doing \u201ca lot better\u201d with Latino voters this time. \u201cPeople will be blown away about how much he actually won by,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to get the electoral votes and the popular vote as well.\u201d</p> \n  <p>His wife, Audrey, also 69, a homemaker and mediator, added: \u201cPolls are just polls.

Trump\u2019s counterclaim was rejected by a judge in New York, Lewis A Kaplan, who said that the allegation that Trump raped Carroll was \u201csubstantially true\u201d.</p> \n  <p>As well as being an adjudicated rapist, Trump has made a litany of sexist comments throughout his public life. In an interview with Esquire Magazine in 1991, Trump said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter what [the media] write as long as you\u2019ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.\u201d</p> \n  <p>In a leaked recording from 2005, Trump told Billy Bush that, \u201cwhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\u201d He adds seconds later: \u201cGrab them by the pussy. You can do anything.\u201d</p> \n  <p>On a 2013 episode of Celebrity Apprentice, Trump said: \u201cIt must be a pretty picture, you dropping to your knees\u201d to a female contestant.</p> \n  <p>His tendency to make misogynistic remarks does not seem to be abating.

      "bodyText": "This blog is closing now, thanks for following along. You can find all of our US elections coverage here. The comments by Trump come as he has struggled to connect with female voters and as Harris courts women in both parties with a message centered on freedom. She\u2019s making the pitch that women should be free to make their own decisions about their bodies and that if Trump is elected, more restrictions will follow as both campaigns sprint toward Tuesday\u2019s presidential election. At a rally Wednesday evening near Green Bay, Wisconsin, Trump told his supporters that aides had urged him to stop using the term protector because it was \u201cinappropriate.\u201d Then he added a new bit to the protector line. He said he told his aides: \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to do it whether the women like it or not. I am going to protect them.\u201d Those comments shaped much of Harris\u2019 Thursday as the two campaigns jostled over the remarks. More detail on Harris\u2019s remarks: she said that Donald Trump\u2019s comment that he would protect women whether they \u201clike it or not\u201d shows that the Republican presidential nominee does not understand women\u2019s rights \u201cto make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s offensive to everybody, by the way,\u201d Harris said before she set out to spend the day campaigning in the western battleground states of Arizona and Nevada. She followed up those remarks at her rally in Phoenix: \u201cHe simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to know what\u2019s in their own best interests and make decisions accordingly. But we trust women.\u201d Meanwhile in Arizona, we\u2019re now taking quite the trip down political memory lane, as Trump recounts his opposition to the Iraq war, and takes a swipe at George W Bush, the last Republican to occupy the White House before he got in. \u201cAnybody that went into the Middle East, I thought was stupid,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBush, oh, he was just, he was another beauty,\u201d he continued, appearing to hold himself back from insulting the ex-president. There are five days left, and \u201cno one can sit on the sidelines\u201d Harris says. People should reach out to friends and family and neighbours and co-workers. \u201cIn these next days let us please be intentional about building community,\u201d she says Harris reminds supporters in Las Vegas that she has spent her life fighting for people who \u201chave been hurt\u201d. She has lived the promise of America, she says, and sees it in everyone there tonight. Donald Trump, in Arizona, is now insulting Kamala Harris, saying she isn\u2019t as smart as Hillary Clinton. The invective came as he recounted his path to the White House in 2016, saying, \u201cAll of a sudden I\u2019m fighting against crooked Hillary Clinton, who\u2019s a smart woman, much smarter than Kamala, but doesn\u2019t lie as much. Hillary was a liar, a horrible scoundrel, but this one lies so much, and she\u2019s a low IQ individual.\u201d Another one about Harris, from Trump: \u201cShe\u2019s dumb as a rock. And you can\u2019t have that.\u201d At the Harris event, the crowd is chanting \u201cWe\u2019re not going back! We\u2019re not going back!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not going back because ours is a fight for the future, and a fight for freedom. The freedom for a woman to make decisions about her own body.\u201d She reminds voters that changes to abortion laws under Trump mean that one in three women now lives in a state with an abortion ban. Tucker Carlson then teed-up a question about the CIA and FBI conspiring against Trump, but the former president didn\u2019t seem interested in answering it. Instead, he proposed firing anyone involved in the Biden administration\u2019s withdrawal from Afghanistan. \u201cYou mentioned the enemy within. . \u2026 It\u2019s a fact that the CIA and the FBI, which are absolutely not allowed by law to have any influence in American politics, because that\u2019s the end of democracy. Both of them and a bunch of other intel agencies worked against you on behalf of the Democratic Party from the minute you got elected in 2016 and they\u2019re still doing it. They\u2019re working against you. Now, what will you do about that?\u201d Carlson asked. Trump didn\u2019t quite say, instead talking about how succeeding in Washington was all about finding the right people. Then he brought up the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, the point at which Joe Biden\u2019s approval ratings began dropping to levels from which they have not recovered. \u201cBy the way, every one of those people having to do with Afghanistan should be fired immediately. Every general should be fired immediately. You know, Biden doesn\u2019t fire anybody,\u201d Trump said. Meanwhile at Trump\u2019s event: Donald Trump doubled down on his insistence that \u201cthe enemy from within\u201d, as he called his political opponents, are a true threat to the country. Kamala Harris has seized on his remarks to argue that he is a fascist looking for \u201cunchecked power\u201d, but Trump doesn\u2019t appear bothered. \u201cWe do have an enemy from within. We have some very bad people, and those people are also very dangerous. They would like to take down our country. They\u2019d like to have our country be a nice communist country or fascist in any way they can, and we have to be careful of that. But they\u2019re the greatest con artists, because [as] soon as I said an enemy from within, they said \u2026 oh, he\u2019s saying an enemy from within. These are sick puppies, I\u2019m telling you.\u201d More detail on J Lo\u2019s appearance a few moments ago, from the press pool report: Jennifer Lopez took to the stage at 9.02, wearing a long olive-colored dress. The crowd sounded very pleased. The event is being livestreamed but here are a couple of quotes: \u201cYou are the ones who are going to send a message \u2013 that Las Vegas is Harris country \u201cKamala Harris gets it \u2026. As president of the United States Kamala will fight for us \u2026 And the freedom to choose to do what we do with our bodies.\u201d On Trump and Madison Square Garden: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just Puerto Ricans who were offended that day. It was every Latino\u201d Shouts of \u2018thank you\u2019 and \u2018we love you J-Lo\u2019 Harris takes to the stage and, smiling, says what she has said before: She\u2019s not afraid of hard work, and nor are those present, she is a new generation of leadership, she has a record of being tough on criminals, and if elected, \u201cthere is nothing that will stand in my way.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s do this Las Vegas,\u201d J Lo says, and introduces Harris. \u201cLet\u2019s get loud,\u201d J Lo says, using a line from the chorus of one of her hits. Then she says she promised herself she wouldn\u2019t get emotional, but that \u201cwe should get emotional.\u201d She calls on voters to encourage their loved ones to vote. \u201cThey love it when you do nothing,\u201d J Lo says, and that a non-vote is an agreement. It wasn\u2019t just Puerto Ricans who were offended by the comments made at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden event, J Lo says, \u201cIt was every Latino in this country. It was humanity and anyone of decent character.\u201d Harris has \u201cshown up every day\u201d for the people, and it is time for them to \u201cshow up for\u201d Harris. J Lo reminds the audience that her parents are children of Puerto Rico. She says she likes Hollywood endings, she likes it when the good girl or good guy wins. And she\u2019ll be voting for Harris. \u201cYou can\u2019t even spell American without \u2018Rican\u2019,\u201d J Lo says. Meanwhile at the Trump event in Arizona: At least once per rally, Donald Trump tries to give his supporters the opportunity to boo reporters in attendance. This evening\u2019s moment just came as he complained about how news outlets had pursued stories about his potential ties to Russia following his 2016 election victory: \u201cIt was a hoax. It was made up to justify why Hillary Clinton lost the election, which he wasn\u2019t supposed to lose \u2026 it was made up by [congressman Adam] Schiff and Hillary and some \u2026 just total sleaze balls. And what happened is, the fake news media, which is back there, you do know that, they\u2019re always around someplace.\u201d And at that, the crowd got their moment to boo. Harris has \u201conly ever had one client: you, the people,\u201d J Lo says. \u201cThere is no candidate in the history of the presidency that is more qualified, and there is no job that Kamala Harris can\u2019t do,\u201d J Lo says, somewhat hyperbolically. She repeats: \u201cKamala Harris gets it.\u201d \u201cI believe in the power of women,\u201d J Lo says. \u201cWomen have the power to make the difference in this election. I believe in the power if Latinos,\u201d she says. \u201cI believe in the power of all our votes.\u201d J Lo is on stage now at the Kamala Harris event in Las Vegas, Nevada. She says that America faces a choice between \u201cdivided and united\u201d And that if you believe that any child in America, if they \u201cwork their ass off\u201d, will be able to make it in America, the choice is clear. \u201cNot just some Americans, but all Americans,\u201d she says. When she started in TV and film, she could get roles playing \u201cthe maid or the loud-mouthed Latina,\u201d but she knew she could do more. A lot of Americans have had that experience, she says. \u201cKamala Harris gets it.\u201d Should Trump lose, it\u2019s widely expected that he will claim fraud, as he did in 2020. To that effect, he says: \u201cI think we\u2019re leading by a lot, and \u2026 we can keep that cheating down, because there are a bunch of cheats. If we can keep that cheating down, we\u2019re going to have a tremendous victory \u2026 I think it\u2019ll go down as one of the greatest victories of all time.\u201d More now from the start of the Trump portion of the Carlson-Trump event in Arizona: After Carlson\u2019s introduction, Donald Trump arrived onstage to Lee Greenwood\u2019s \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d, his customary entry music. First question from Tucker Carlson: \u201cWhat motivates you to keep going?\u201d Trump\u2019s supporters often point to the fact that he\u2019s rich, thus doesn\u2019t stand to benefit from being president, and therefore must be running for some altruistic reason. This is a friendly crowd, and Trump gave them the answer they wanted to hear: \u201chell knows. I don\u2019t know \u2026 I just want to be with people like this \u2026 so much love in this room, so much love, right? It\u2019s pretty easy \u2026 I have a lot of alternatives. [I] could be in a beautiful beach with the waves hitting me in the face and all that boring stuff. And I\u2019ve been there, and you get very bored pretty easily. I have one thing in mind: It\u2019s called Make America Great Again.\u201d Trump is now in stage with Tucker Carlson. He repeats his very well-worn line that he could be doing anything right now \u2013 he could be on the beach, he says this time \u2013but has instead chosen to do this. In addition to praising Trump, Tucker Carlson is also swiping at his enemies. He just took aim at congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an influential progressive who conservatives like Carlson have no time for. \u201cAOC, that would be Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, I love that she\u2019s this revolutionary who\u2019s named after a Conquistador and doesn\u2019t even know it. Your last name is Cortez, honey, sit this one out,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cLike, Larry Mussolini shows up and is, like, no, I\u2019m against fascism, really. All right, got it. What a moron.\u201d He segued into an attack on second gentleman Doug Emhoff: \u201cShe was at a rally in Vegas yesterday, and she goes, Doug emhoff is the model of masculinity. Oh man, yeah, memo to any unmarried women here, do not date a feminist man. They\u2019ll smack you around.\u201d Here is the full report from the Associated Press on the Biden apostrophe question: No sign of Donald Trump yet, but Tucker Carlson is now onstage at the Republican candidate\u2019s Arizona event, singing the former president\u2019s praises. Carlson is set to sit down with Trump in what has been billed as a fundraiser for Hurricane Helene relief, but is now giving something of a warm-up speech. Referring back to how Trump was received when he launched his campaign in 2015, Carlson said: \u201cEverything he said was kind of moderate and sensible, like, I don\u2019t know, we should have a border, and if we\u2019re going to have Nato, maybe that countries in Nato should help pay for it. If we\u2019re going to defend Europe, maybe they could, you know, pony up a little bit. Why are we paying the entire bill? That didn\u2019t seem crazy to me, boy, they treated Trump like he was a dangerous freak, like he just escaped from the state mental institution, shackles on his arm and a butcher knife in his hand, stop this man.\u201d He left out the part about how, as he launched his campaign, Trump called Mexicans rapists \u2013 the sort of offensive comment that turned off swathes of the electorate, but didn\u2019t prevent him from winning in 2016. The former independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr is speaking now at the Trump rally in Arizona, and appeared to describe a conversation with Donald Trump where he asked him to play a role in his administration. Kennedy, a conspiracy theorist known for his opposition to vaccines, dropped out of the presidential race in August and endorsed the former president, and there\u2019s lately been talk of Trump appointing him to lead an agency or department, if re-elected. \u201cAs soon as Donald Trump started talking about giving me the power, he asked me to do three things. He asked me to root out the corruption, and end the conflicts of interest in our regulatory agencies, and end this corporate capture that has turned our regulatory agencies into sock puppets [of] the industries they\u2019re supposed to regulate. And he asked me to restore the tradition of gold-standard, empirically based, evidence-based science in medicine in our regulatory agencies, and to restore the transparency so that these agencies have to must stop hiding science from us when it clashes with the commercial ambitions of the pharmaceutical industry,\u201d Kennedy said, adding that Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t want me to take vaccines away from people\u201d. \u201cHe asked me to do that, and then he asked me to end the chronic disease epidemic in this country. And he said, and he said, I want to see results, measurable results, in the diminishment of chronic disease within two years. And I said, Mr President, I will do that.\u201d Employees for Arizona\u2019s most populous county are taking on extra shifts to help election workers with an around-the-clock operation to process early ballots that are an unusually long two pages, the Associated Press reports. Election officials in Maricopa County must verify each voter\u2019s signature on early ballot envelopes and then remove the ballot pages so they can be prepared for actual counting. The county was unsure how long it would need to keep up the 24-hour operation, which kicked off Thursday night. \u201cAs predicted, the first two-page ballot since 2006 has affected election administration, especially for the hard-working bipartisan boards who are separating the ballot pages from the affidavit envelopes,\u201d said Jennifer Liewer, Maricopa County deputy elections director for communications. \u201cIn addition to election workers already on staff, county workers are stepping up to assist with the process,\u201d she said. Liewer said early Thursday evening that the number of people helping out would fluctuate as they are trained, but that eventually between 150 and 200 people are expected to be used for the additional shifts. \u201cThe county employees who are assisting with the night shifts are doing so outside of their normal job responsibilities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are also utilizing Maricopa County Public Health Medical Reserve Corps members.\u201d Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer said earlier this week that ballots have been received from 1 million voters, a number approaching 40% of the nearly 2.6 million people registered. Election officials in the presidential battleground state have urged people to vote early, or make a plan if they opt to cast their ballots in person on Election Day, which is Tuesday. Early voting, particularly by mail, has long been popular in Arizona, where nearly 80% of voters submitted their ballots before Election Day in 2020, according to the secretary of state\u2019s Office. Arizona was the first of the presidential battleground states to open early in-person voting sites on Oct. 9, with a scattering of traditional voting centers. Just spotted at Tucker Carlson\u2018s Hurricane Helene fundraiser in Phoenix with Donald Trump: a man wearing a garbage bag. He had cut holes in it so it fit sort of like a vest over his shirt. The costume is plainly a reference to Joe Biden\u2018s statement, which he says was misinterpreted, that people who vote for Trump are \u201cgarbage\u201d. Trump has seized on Biden\u2019s gaffe to argue that Democrats are insincere when they say they want to unify the country, holding a rally in Wisconsin yesterday where he was dressed in an orange reflective vest, like a garbage man would wear. It does happen to be Halloween night, but costumes aren\u2019t unusual at Trump campaign events, no matter the time of year. At the Republican national convention in July, there were people wearing brick-patterned suits to represent the wall Trump wants to build along the Mexican border, and fake bandages on their ears, as Trump\u2019s was at the time after the Butler, Pennsylvania assassination attempt. Donald Trump will soon take the stage at a Hurricane Helene relief fundraiser in Phoenix, Arizona, where he\u2019s billed to chat with star conservative broadcaster Tucker Carlson. The former president hasn\u2019t been sighted yet, but the crowd did get a pep talk from Charlie Kirk, founder of conservative youth group Turning Point USA. In 2020, Joe Biden won Arizona, and Kirk entreated the crowd to do everything they can to prevent Kamala Harris from winning the swing state again. \u201cI want you to recreate the anger that you felt, I want you to recreate that pit of the stomach for those you that lived through your whole life and you thought this state would never, ever, ever send its votes to a Democrat as president,\u201d Kirk said. \u201cWe can all do more to make sure that will never happen again, and in the coming days that will be determined.\u201d Kirk told the crowd: \u201cThere are hundreds of thousands of Trump supporters right now in the valley that have received mail-in ballots that have not yet submitted them. We need to find those people and get them the system. There are hundreds of thousands of Trump supporters that may or may not show up. These are plumbers, electricians and welders. These are people that we love and that we cherish might say, oh, my vote won\u2019t matter. You need to convince them to go to the polls and get their vote in and bring two friends with them.\u201d He also noted that Republicans have improved their early voting response rate since 2020. However, early voting is not predictive of election results, and the Trump campaign is this year encouraging voters to submit ballots early, after downplaying it in 2020. Nerves are particularly stretched in Maricopa, the Arizona county in which Phoenix sits, and which will probably decide whether Harris or Trump, who has a narrow lead in recent polls, wins Arizona. After Trump\u2019s loss in the state in 2020, his supporters staged demonstrations in Phoenix\u2019s streets. This time around, election officials in Maricopa county plan to have a Swat team and mounted sheriff\u2019s deputies ready at the building where they tabulate ballots. Last week, Phoenix police arrested a man for setting fire at a postal box that damaged some mail-in ballots, though said the suspect said his actions were not politically motivated. At Harris\u2019s speech in Phoenix on Thursday, the vice-president told voters to prepare for \u201cone of the most consequential elections of our lifetime\u201d and criticized the former president for saying he\u2019d protect women \u201cwhether the women like it or not\u201d. But the question of what the former president\u2019s supporters would do if he loses was on attendees\u2019 mind. \u201cI would say that I definitely worry about that since he hasn\u2019t conceded the last election,\u201d said Bethany Hagen, 34, as she waited for a ride in the parking lot of the amphitheater where Harris spoke. While no one the Guardian spoke to predicted imminent violence, many acknowledged that life in a swing state made participating in, or even discussing, politics a fraught experience. \u201cIt is hard to talk to people here,\u201d said Hagen, a Colorado native who had moved to the state. Pearl Hubbard picked up some yard signs for Kamala Harris at the vice-president\u2019s speech in Phoenix, Arizona, on Thursday afternoon, but wasn\u2019t yet sure whether she\u2019d risk displaying them outside her home in a city that sits in some of the most hotly contested political territory in the country. \u201cI\u2019m scared to put them up,\u201d Hubbard said. \u201cAs I drive \u2026 I only saw one place that had a [Harris] sign. Just don\u2019t see them. I think people are scared to put them up.\u201d After Joe Biden became the first Democrat since 1996 to win the state four years ago, Arizona\u2019s capital and most-populous city, Phoenix, saw tense confrontations between local officials and Trump supporters who believed his baseless claims that the election was stolen from him. With the 5 November presidential election days away, Trump still refuses to publicly acknowledge his defeat in 2020, and has already suggested that if he loses this year, he will once again claim fraud. The allegations have changed life for formerly low-key election offices and secretaries of state nationwide, as they regularly face threats, hoaxes and harassment, especially in the seven swing states that are expected to decide the election: The AP story goes on to say that according to the email the news organisation obtained, the press office had asked the stenographers to quickly produce a transcript of the call amid the firestorm: Biden himself took to social media to say that he was not calling all Trump supporters garbage and that he was referring specifically to the \u201chateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump\u2019s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally.\u201d The stenographers office is charged with preparing accurate transcripts of public and private remarks of the president for preservation by the National Archives and distribution to the public. The two-person stenography team on duty that evening \u2013 a \u201ctyper\u201d and \u201cproofer\u201d \u2013 said any edit to the transcript would have to be approved by their supervisor, the head of stenographers\u2019 office. The supervisor was not immediately available to review the audio, but the press office went ahead and published the altered transcript on the White House website and distributed it to press and on social media in an effort to tamp down the story. White House senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates that evening also posted on X the edited version of the quote and wrote that Biden was referring \u201dto the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as \u2018garbage.\u2019\u201d The supervisor, a career employee of the White House, raised the concerns about the press office action \u2013 but did not weigh in on the accuracy of the edit \u2013 in an email to White House communications director Ben LaBolt, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and other press and communications officials. \u201cRegardless of urgency, it is essential to our transcripts\u2019 authenticity and legitimacy that we adhere to consistent protocol for requesting edits, approval, and release,\u201d the supervisor wrote. The supervisor declined to comment to The AP and referred questions about the matter to the White House press office. The Associated Press reports, citing two US government officials and an internal email obtained on Thursday, that White House press officials altered the official transcript of a call in which Joe Biden appeared to take a swipe at supporters of Donald Trump, drawing objections from the federal workers who document such remarks for posterity: Biden created an uproar earlier this week with his remarks to Latino activists responding to racist comments at a Trump rally made by the comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who referred to the US island territory of Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage.\u201d Biden, according to a transcript prepared by the official White House stenographers, told the Latino group on a Tuesday evening video call, \u201cThe only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters \u2013 his \u2013 his demonisation of Latinos is unconscionable, and it\u2019s un-American.\u201d The transcript released by the White House press office, however, rendered the quote with an apostrophe, reading \u201csupporter\u2019s\u201d rather than \u201csupporters,\u201d which aides said pointed to Biden criticizing Hinchcliffe, not the millions of Americans who are supporting Trump for president. The change was made after the press office \u201cconferred with the president,\u201d according to an internal email from the head of the stenographers\u2019 office that was obtained by The AP. The authenticity of the email was confirmed by two government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters. The supervisor, in the email, called the press office\u2019s handling of the matter \u201ca breach of protocol and spoilation of transcript integrity between the Stenography and Press Offices.\u201d \u201cIf there is a difference in interpretation, the Press Office may choose to withhold the transcript but cannot edit it independently,\u201d the supervisor wrote, adding, \u201cOur Stenography Office transcript \u2013 released to our distro, which includes the National Archives \u2013 is now different than the version edited and released to the public by Press Office staff.\u201d Donald Trump has wrapped up a rally in Henderson, near Las Vegas in Nevada, a swing state where Latino people make up about 30% of the population. \u201cWe\u2019re especially excited to have the support of record numbers of Hispanic Americans,\u201d he said, \u201cand right here in Nevada we\u2019re going to win a record share of the Hispanic American vote at a level that nobody\u2019s ever seen before for the party.\u201d The Trump campaign was forced into damage control mode over the weekend when a comedian speaking at his big New York rally called Puerto Rico a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d, prompting criticism from Latino activists. But the Republican nominee argued that he has a winning agenda. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple: Hispanics want great jobs, they want rising wages and they want safe communities. They\u2019re great people. Energy \u2013 they\u2019re very entrepreneurial. I know\u2019em well, they\u2019re really hard workers, they\u2019re great people. \u201cYou don\u2019t want vicious gang members getting dumped into your state and you don\u2019t want Kamala teaching your children that they can change their gender anytime they\u2019d like.\u201d Trump also used the rally to recycle election lies, promise that Robert Kennedy Jr is \u201cgoing to work on women\u2019s health\u201d and lavish praise on Elon Musk for space rockets and campaigning in Pennsylvania. He hurled insults at Kamala Harris as lacking \u201cintellect\u201d or \u201cstamina\u201d, a \u201ctrain wreck\u201d and incapable of running a kindergarten. And in a bizarre riff against Democrats, Trump said: \u201cThey don\u2019t want windows. They don\u2019t want cows. They don\u2019t want anything. They don\u2019t know what they want, actually.\u201d Historian Simon Schama responded on Twitter/X: \u201c\u2018they dont want windows, they dont want cows\u2019 how moronically dumb do you have to be to think this creature is fit to be President?\u201d The cast of Marvel\u2019s Avengers movies have come out in support of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris less than a week before the US election. In a video posted first on Vanity Fair on Thursday evening, actors Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Don Cheadle, Chris Evans, Danai Gurira and Paul Bettany playfully riffed on their respective characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe while encouraging viewers to vote for Harris. The video, which runs for just over 90 seconds, opens with the actors taking an incoming video call from Johansson. On screen, they brainstorm ideas for a catchphrase for Harris, landing on the dubious \u201cDown with Democracy\u201d, which they spin into a brief Marvel-style Harris-Walz campaign video with dramatic music and comic-style graphics. The final frame of the video encourages viewers to vote on 5 November. Sharing the video on Twitter/X, Ruffalo, a vocal Democratic supporter who is best known for his role as the Hulk, wrote: \u201cDon\u2019t sit this one out. It\u2019s the one where we will lose big: Project 2025, women\u2019s reproductive rights, climate change, LGBTQIA+ rights, public education, student debt relief, Affordable Care Act, Social Security, and as of today, life saving vaccines. This shit is real and it\u2019s going to come for you.\u201d Trump will be campaigning with far-right personality Tucker Carlson in about 90 minutes\u2019 time in Phoenix, Arizona. Here is the pool report on Harris\u2019s speech in Reno: VP Harris wrapped up at 5.46pm and did a bit of ropeline. Her comments were similar to her earlier speech although targeted to Nevada at the start. There was a lot of placard waving, stamping of feet, booing at mentions of Trump, and chants of Kamala. \u201cWe need you to vote, Nevada, you are going to make the difference in this election and I thank you,\u201d she said. Protesters interrupted Harris again at least three times, by pool\u2019s count. At least one could be heard shouting about Gaza. Harris drowned out the most vocal protesters when she said \u201cLet me say something about this \u2013 we are here because we\u2019re fighting for a democracy\u201d, drawing loud cheers from the crowd. Pool was rushed back at motorcade and now about to roll as of 5.54pm. Pop icon Jennifer Lopez and the Mexican band Man\u00e1 are performing at Harris\u2019s event in Las Vegas, in about two hours\u2019 time. Harris ends her speech with the call: \u201cWhen we fight, we win!\u201d She is shortly heading to Las Vegas, where she will appear at a campaign rally and concert. Cutting away from the rally for a moment, the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, has released a statement in which he says that a video that claimed to show a Haitian immigrant claiming to have voted multiple times is \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201ctargeted disinformation\u201d. He said: Earlier today, our office became aware of a video purporting to show a Haitian immigrant with multiple Georgia ID\u2019s claiming to have voted multiple times. This is false, and is an example of targeted disinformation we\u2019ve seen this election. It is likely foreign interference attempting to sow discord and chaos on the eve of the election. We are working to combat this and identify the origin of it with our state and federal partners. CISA is currently investigating. In the meantime, we ask Elon Musk and the leadership of other social media platforms to take this down. This is obviously fake and part of a disinformation effort. Likely it is a production of Russian troll farms. As Americans we can\u2019t let our enemies use lies to divide us and undermine our faith in our institutions \u2013 or each other. \u201cSo, Nevada, I am here asking for your vote. I am asking for your vote. And here is my pledge to you,\u201d she says. Someone yells: \u201cWe got your back,\u201d and Harris responds: \u201cAnd I got your back.\u201d She promises to find commonsense solutions, reach common ground, listen to experts and to those who disagree with her. She repeats her line that Trump wants to put those who disagree with him in jail, and that she wants to give them a seat at the table. She promises to be a president for all Americans. \u201cBecause we love our country. And when you love something, you fight for it,\u201d she says, to loud cheers. Harris says forcefully, and with seriousness: \u201cWe\u2019re here because we\u2019re fighting for a democracy!\u201d She gets huge cheers. Then she appears to be heckled, though I could not make it out. She says: \u201cIt\u2019s OK. It\u2019s OK. You know what, democracy can be complicated. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting for the right for people to be heard and not jailed because they speak their mind.\u201d Harris talks about her plans for small business owners, and asks any small business owners to make some noise: there is a lot of enthusiastic noise in response. From the pool report at the event: \ufeffMotorcade stopped at 5pm and pool was ushered into a packed Reno Expo Center, an indoor arena with tiered seating and with crowds standing in the middle, in front of the VP\u2019s lectern. There\u2019s a large red sign saying Reno Votes Harris-Walz with two large US flags above one tier and a blue one saying When We Vote We Win. Uplifting music is booming \u2013 the crowd waved their signs in time to Katy Perry\u2019s \u2018Firework.\u2019 \ufeffAt 5.21pm VP Harris emerged from behind a curtain in a doorway beneath a large sign saying \u2018Reno Votes\u2019, and walked 50 yards or so along a runway to the lectern. \u201cMake no mistake: we will win,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is time for a new generation of leadership in America,\u201d says Harris. \u201cAnd I am ready to offer that leadership.\u201d Harris, who recently turned 60, is a generation younger than Donald Trump, her opponent, who is 78, and Joe Biden, 81, who she replaced on the Democratic ticket. Harris starts by saying: \u201cHappy Nevada day!\u201d \u201cWe need you to vote, Nevada: you are going to make the difference in the outcome of this election and I thank you, I thank you.\u201d Harris has taken to the stage now in Reno, Nevada. She and Trump are tied in the state according to the latest polling: Kamala Harris\u2019s event in Reno, Nevada has started. She is not yet on stage. Trump is still speaking in Nevada: Speaking at a rally in Arizona earlier on Thursday, Kamala Harris said Donald Trump doesn\u2019t believe women should \u201cmake decisions over their own bodies\u201d. Harris made the comment after Trump\u2019s appearance in Wisconsin, when he declared he would protect them \u201cwhether the women like it or not\u201d. Harris said: \u201cThere\u2019s a saying that you gotta listen to people when they tell you who they are. He does not believe women should have the agency and authority to make decisions about their own bodies.\u201d Practising witches from around the world gathered in Salem by the hundreds on Thursday night to honour Stormy Daniels at their annual \u201cmagic circle\u201d ceremony recognizing loved ones who have died. Daniels \u2013 the adult film actor who allegedly had an affair with Donald Trump and was at the center of his May criminal trial that led to the former president\u2019s conviction on 34 felonies \u2013 was chosen to be honored in the Halloween ceremony as the organisers believe that she has been the victim of a modern-day witch-hunt. The event, which started at 5pm at Salem Common in Salem, Massachusetts, was part of the Festival of the Dead, an annual event series exploring \u201cdeath\u2019s macabre customs, heretical histories and strange rituals\u201d. The magic circle ceremony is intended to be a time to \u201crenew connections, mourn those you miss and to celebrate all that these cherished souls brought to your life\u201d, according to the event details: Donald Trump is talking again about Biden\u2019s \u201cgarbage\u201d gaffe, saying he thinks it is \u201cworse than \u2018deplorables\u2019 \u2013 am I right?\u201d \u201cAnd how did that go for Hillary?\u201d he asks. Donald Trump has taken the stage in Henderson, Nevada, to the familiar strains of Lee Greenwood\u2019s song God Bless the USA as supporters snap pictures on their phones. Big screens say \u201cBetter off with Trump\u201d and \u201cTrump will fix it!\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to start with a very simple question: are you better off now than you were four years ago?\u201d the Republican nominee asked. \u201cNo!\u201d roared the crowd. Trump was quick to lambast his opponent Kamala Harris. \u201cShe is the worst vice-president in the history of our country. Kamala, you\u2019re fired! Get the hell out of here. She is horrible. And she lies. Every time she gets up she tells a lie.\u201d He added: \u201cShe lies about everything. She\u2019s worse than Crooked Hillary, actually.\u201d Trump trotted out his familiar lines, accusing Harris of violating her oath, eradicating the border and unleashing an army of gangs and criminals from prisons, jails, \u201cinsane asylums and mental institutions from all around the world, from Venezuela to the Congo\u201d. He is now playing a video about the murder of a 12-year-old girl, allegedly by undocumented immigrants. The crowd is lapping it up. Some fans are wearing yellow vests to resemble garbage collectors, a reference to Joe Biden\u2019s recent alleged gaffe. When Trump asked who had already voted, a big cheer went up. But he has failed to draw a capacity crowd: there are a few rows of empty seats behind me. The Guardian\u2019s David Smith is at the Trump rally in Nevada, where the Republican nominee asked the crowd if they felt they were better off now than they were four years ago. The crowd yelled: \u201cNo!\u201d Here\u2019s what\u2019s coming up over the next few hours: Kamala Harris will hold a campaign rally in Reno, Nevada in the early evening. Harris will also a campaign rally and concert in Las Vegas. Trump will attend a Tucker Carlson tour event in Glendale, Arizona. This is Helen Sullivan taking over the Guardian\u2019s live US politics coverage \u2013 my colleagues and I will bring you the latest from those events, and any other breaking news. There are five days left until the US election. Here are the key recent developments: Kamala Harris has taken the stage in Phoenix, telling supporters: \u201cWe have five days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime.\u201d She emphasized the threats a Trump administration would pose to reproductive rights. \u201cDid everyone hear what he just said yesterday, that he will do what he wants, whether the women like it or not?\u201d she said, referencing his appearance in Wisconsin, when he declared he would protect them \u201cwhether the women like it or not\u201d. Tim Keller, the mayor of Albuquerque, where Trump is holding a rally, said last Friday that the Republican presidential candidate owes the city hundreds of thousands of dollars in bills from his last visit. The Trump campaign owed the city $200,000 for when he hosted his last rally at its convention center in 2019, which has climbed to almost $445,000 with interest. The costs covered police coverage, barricades and other expenses. Trump is banned from rallying in the city over the unpaid bill \u2013 his event is being held instead at a private hangar owned by CSI Aviation near the Albuquerque international sunport. Billionaires have flushed the election with cash \u2013 roughly $1.9b to be exact, largely to the benefit of republican candidates like Trump. \u201cBillionaire campaign spending on this scale drowns out the voices and concerns of ordinary Americans. It is one of the most obvious and disturbing consequences of the growth of billionaire fortunes, as well as being a prime indicator that the system regulating campaign finance has collapsed,\u201d said David Kass, ATF\u2019s executive director. Voter enthusiasm is at a historical high for a presidential election, a Gallup poll found. Similar to November 2020, 70% of registered voters nationwide said that they were more enthusiastic than usual about voting now compared to March, when only 56% expressed enthusiasm. Trump\u2019s former attorney Kenneth Chesebro has been suspended from practicing law in New York. Chesboro was indicted on state racketeering and conspiracy charges over efforts to overturn Trump\u2019s defeat in the 2020 election in Georgia. Harris has received more endorsements today. Former New York mayor and 2020 presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg and the Economist have publicly expressed their support. Harris said on Thursday that Trump\u2019s comment that he would protect women \u201cwhether the women like it or not\u201d showed that the Republican presidential nominee does not understand women\u2019s \u201cagency, their authority, their right and their ability to make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s offensive to everybody, by the way,\u201d Harris said before she set out to spend the day campaigning in the western swing states of Arizona and Nevada. Harris will be joined by Jennifer Lopez for her rally in Las Vegas, Nevada - a critical swing state. Ex-Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson will interview Trump in Arizona before the former president heads to his own rally in Nevada. Arizona\u2019s secretary of state, Adrian Fontes, was ordered to turn over a list of 98,000 voters who may not have provided proof of citizenship. The list was sought by a group called Stronger Communities Foundation. A county judge ordered Fontes to hand over the list of voters by Monday. Fontes argued that he was entitled to withhold the information to protect the safety of the voters, which includes a small group of people who may hold pre-1996 drivers licenses and, due to some complex bureaucracy, may not have been asked to provide proof of citizenship at voter registration as required by a later, 2004 law. The judge who made the order said there was \u201clack of any evidence that any individual life was in danger,\u201d but also forbade Stronger Communities from using the list to contact voters before Election day. Hannah Fried, executive director of All Voting Is Local, wrote that the order to release the list got her attention, but that laws protect voters from intimidation, regardless. While Elon Musk faces his own election integrity questions offline, the X owner has deputized his followers to spot and report any \u201cpotential instances of voter fraud and irregularities\u201d. The community he spawned is rife with unfounded claims passed off as evidence of voter fraud. Musk opted not to show up to a required court appearance Thursday in Philadelphia to respond to a lawsuit challenging his political action committee\u2019s daily $1m voter giveaway. Meanwhile, online, he has started a dedicated community space on X, formerly Twitter, where he\u2019s asked users to share any issues they see while voting. Users posting on the self-contained feed, the \u201celection integrity community\u201d, quickly began pointing out what they deemed as evidence of fraud and election interference. Tweets showing everything from ballots that arrived ripped, an ABC news system test, a postal worker doing his job and dropping off mail-in ballots were all presented as evidence that the upcoming presidential election had been compromised. Some users posted videos of individuals they deemed suspicious, despite providing little or no proof of suspicious activity and asked others in the community to help identify them. Among the tweets are attempts at doxxing and identifying people who users falsely accuse of ballot box stuffing or preventing Trump supporters from voting. In one case, a post with 14,000 shares and 31,000 likes includes a video of a postal worker bringing ballots into a polling location in Northampton county, Pennsylvania. Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James has endorsed Kamala Harris, writing: \u201cWhen I think about my kids and my family and how they will grow up, the choice is clear to me.\u201d The endorsement isn\u2019t a surprise \u2013 James has supported Democrats before, and been critical of Donald Trump. Supporters of Donald Trump, gathering for a campaign rally in Henderson, near Las Vegas in Nevada, are confident that he will win next week\u2019s presidential election \u2013 and some refuse to contemplate defeat. Bob Diaz, 69, who is Latino and teaches at a college, said Trump is doing \u201ca lot better\u201d with Latino voters this time. \u201cPeople will be blown away about how much he actually won by,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to get the electoral votes and the popular vote as well.\u201d His wife, Audrey, also 69, a homemaker and mediator, added: \u201cPolls are just polls. I believe he\u2019s going to win. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this. I\u2019ve been involved with other campaigns. I\u2019ve never seen so many age groups, so many cultures, so many countries, so many languages. I\u2019ve never, ever seen this before.\u201d She believes that border security is a winning issue for the Republican nominee. \u201cI wish he didn\u2019t cuss, I wish he didn\u2019t say weird things, but he\u2019s going to protect our borders and clean it up from the inside and protect it from the outside. Bottom line.\u201d Some here say they would not accept a Trump defeat. Kathy Holesapple, 56, an entrepreneu, pilot and aircraft mechanic, said: \u201cWe won\u2019t. None of us will. We know he didn\u2019t lose in 2020 either. \u201cGod\u2019s going to bring it in and take down the wicked. The righteous will be lifted up and the wicked will fall and those who support the death of innocent children in America and around the world will not survive in this nation. They will not be in power for much longer.\u201d Enrique Lopez, 32, a physical therapy student and military veteran, warned: \u201cNo matter what happens, there\u2019s going to be a lot of chaos on both sides. Whether Trump wins or loses, there\u2019s going to be so much chaos.\u201d Kamala Harris has taken the stage in Phoenix, telling supporters: \u201cWe have five days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime.\u201d She emphasized the threats a Trump administration would pose to reproductive rights. \u201cDid everyone hear what he just said yesterday, that he will do what he wants, whether the women like it or not?\u201d she said, referencing his appearance in Wisconsin, when he declared he would protect them \u201cwhether the women like it or not\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a saying that you gotta listen to people when they tell you who they are,\u201d she said. \u201cHe does not believe women should have the agency and authority to make decisions about their own bodies.\u201d Donald Trump has baselessly claimed that Democrats are acting like the \u201cgestapo\u201d in forcing people to adopt electric vehicles, during a rally in New Mexico today. In his latest broadside against electric cars, the former president said that trucks made 50 years ago are better than electric versions today but that people are being forced to switch by a Joe Biden administration that is using tactics he likened to Nazi Germany. \u201cSo, I said, did you explain that to the authorities as they burst into your office to demand that you go all electric?\u201d Trump said, in reference to a conversation he\u2019d had with someone. \u201cHe said: \u2018I explained it.\u2019 \u2018What did they say?\u2019 \u2018We don\u2019t give a damn. We want you to go all electric.\u2019 \u201cThis is what we\u2019re dealing with. It\u2019s like gestapo stuff, OK? They use that term. It\u2019s like gestapo stuff. What they\u2019re doing to our country is unbelievable.\u201d Trump\u2019s accusation is based on a falsehood \u2013 there is no obligation to switch to electric cars nor any ban on gasoline or diesel cars. Despite this, Trump\u2019s campaign has repeatedly claimed otherwise, assailing Kamala Harris in TV adverts for adopting an \u201cEV mandate\u201d. Electric cars have long stirred antipathy in Trump, who has said incentives to buy them are \u201clunacy\u201d and that their supporters should \u201crot in hell\u201d even as Elon Musk, the billionaire chief of electric car giant Tesla, has become one of Trump\u2019s most prominent backers. The president acknowledged this incongruity in August when he said: \u201cI\u2019m for electric cars, I have to be because Elon endorsed me very strongly.\u201d The ceasefire against electric vehicles now appears to be over, however. Should he win next week\u2019s election, Trump is expected to roll back vehicle pollution standards that nudge people to buy electric alternatives, as well as repeal tax rebates for people to buy electric models. Gasoline cars, trucks and other forms of transport are the largest sectoral contributor of planet-heating gases in the US, as well as a major source of the air pollution that routinely causes tens of thousands of respiratory and cardiovascular health problems, and deaths, among Americans each year. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign is quite present at this Quakertown voting location, where there\u2019s a long line of people waiting to vote. They have a table set up with coffee and donuts, and volunteers are going up and down the line giving voters the forms they need to fill out to request their mail-in ballots on demand. I chatted with Betsy Cross, a Trump campaign volunteer from New Jersey who was handing out forms to people in line to request their mail-in ballots on demand. She had been there since 2.30 and estimated people were waiting two hours to vote. Was she surprised that so many people were there? \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople want to bank their vote for president Trump.\u201d I just stopped by a voting location in Bucks county, a Pennsylvania battleground where a local judge extended the deadline for voters to cast ballots after a Trump campaign lawsuit. Voters here can request and return an absentee ballot on the spot \u2013 Pennsylvania\u2019s clunky version of early, in-person voting \u2013 until Friday. The deadline for the rest of the state was Tuesday, but the Trump campaign successfully sued the county to get voting extended until Friday. Residents had been blocked from voting even though they were in line by 5pm, the daily cutoff. I arrived a little after 3pm at the government offices in Quakertown and saw that there was a pretty long line stretching around the corner. Just before he went into vote, a man at the front of the line told me he had been waiting about an hour. One of the people in the back of the line was Phil Haegele, a 47-year-old plumber who was celebrating his sixth wedding anniversary. He said he was supporting Donald Trump and that he\u2019d heard about voting being extended on the radio yesterday and got \u201cprobably 50 text messages\u201d encouraging him and his wife to come vote. Haegele usually votes on election day but said that he had decided to come out and cast his ballot early. \u201cWe had saw that on a lot of the news agencies that we follow, they were saying that they were trying to get as many Trump supporters to vote early to try and ward off as much fraud as they could,\u201d he said. He predicted that the election would be a \u201cblowout\u201d, even though the polls show an extremely tight race in Pennsylvania and across the country. \u201cIf they call the election on election day, it\u2019s gonna be a blowout,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they need to take a week to print more ballots, then yes, it\u2019s gonna be tough.\u201d Supporters of Donald Trump in Henderson, near Las Vegas in Nevada, are giving short shrift to a controversy over his remark on Wednesday that he would protect women \u201cwhether the women like it or not\u201d. Awaiting a Trump campaign rally, Patty Periva, 74, a retired education worker, said: \u201cI don\u2019t care. The Democrats do not protect women. They allow abortions. How many of those abortions are women? They\u2019re killing women and they don\u2019t protect women. It\u2019s a lie.\u201d Lisa Consigilo, 60, a retired personal trainer, added: \u201cMy family\u2019s from New York. Some things he says people take literally but I know how he speaks: it\u2019s how my dad spoke. You don\u2019t need to take stuff so literally. \u201cAll their campaign is running on lies. He\u2019s not going to ban abortion across the country. You can\u2019t: it\u2019s impossible. He\u2019s not for that. Everything that they\u2019re running on is not true about Project 2025. He\u2019s a dad, he\u2019s a grandfather, it wasn\u2019t literal like: \u2018I\u2019m going to protect women.\u2019\u201d Opinion polls suggest a historic gender gap in the presidential election, with women supporting Kamala Harris by a wide margin. But Kathy Holesapple, 56, an entrepreneur, pilot and aircraft mechanic, said: \u201cThey\u2019ve weaponised the women against this party but the truth is that they\u2019ve also held down the women in this nation by calling us Karens. \u201cWe\u2019re not allowed to stand up and speak for our beliefs. They call us a Karen every time we speak up. So the American woman needs to stand up \u2013 and they will \u2013 and they\u2019re going to realise that Trump is for American women. He\u2019s for women all over the world.\u201d Raids and mass deportations lie at the heart of the former president\u2019s second-term vision \u2013 a web of policies so vast that critics say their collective implementation would challenge the very ideal of the United States as a nation of immigrants. Should he win in November, the Republican nominee has vowed not only to restore many of his most controversial immigration policies, but to go even further. While a number of his first-term plans were stymied by the courts and Congress, immigration rights leaders believe a second Trump administration would likely be more sophisticated and strategic. \u201cIt is different this time. There\u2019s a plan. There is a sense of urgency that they\u2019ve created around this issue,\u201d said Vanessa C\u00e1rdenas, executive director of the immigration advocacy group America\u2019s Voice. \u201cAnd they know how to use the levers of government in a way they didn\u2019t in 2016.\u201d Donald Trump would also be operating in a changed political landscape. Since leaving office, the political center of gravity has shifted rightward, amid a post-pandemic rise in global migration that saw a record number of people arriving at the southern border and claiming asylum. Americans have become less tolerant of illegal immigration while a growing minority is increasingly concerned about its impact on the country\u2019s economy and national identity. Though border crossings have plummeted this year following the president\u2019s asylum clampdown, a sense of disorder persists. Voters continue to broadly disapprove of the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s handling of the situation. Trump and his team are confident immigration remains a potent political issue for voters \u2013 and one that he has long played to his advantage. When Trump first descended a golden escalator in 2015, he pledged to construct a \u201cgreat wall\u201d along the south-west border with Mexico to keep out immigrants he disparaged as \u201crapists\u201d and drug dealers. Now, in the final weeks of his third presidential race, Trump has again escalated his threats against immigrants, but this time he is turning his vitriol inward toward those already here. \u201cThe United States is now an occupied country,\u201d Trump claimed recently at a rally in Atlanta. \u201cBut on November 5, 2024, that will be liberation day in America.\u201d The vice-president will be appearing in Phoenix alongside the musical group Los Tigres del Norte. Then, she\u2019ll be heading to Las Vegas, where she will be campaigning alongside Jennifer Lopez and Mana\u0301. In both cities, Harris will seek to energize Latino voters, who could help decide the outcome of the race in the key swing states of Arizona and Nevada. Happy Halloween! There are barely five days left in the 2024 US presidential election and polls show the candidates \u2013 Kamala Harris and Donald Trump \u2013 remain neck and neck in swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina. More than 60 million Americans have cast ballots so far. Harris and Trump are traveling across the western half of the country in states like New Mexico, Nevada and Arizona in the final days of their campaigns. Here\u2019s a summary of the day so far: Tim Keller, the mayor of Albuquerque, where Trump is holding a rally, said last Friday that the Republican presidential candidate owes the city hundreds of thousands of dollars in bills from his last visit. The Trump campaign owed the city $200,000 for when he hosted his last rally at its convention center in 2019, which has climbed to almost $445,000 with interest. The costs covered police coverage, barricades and other expenses. Trump is banned from rallying in the city over the unpaid bill \u2013 his event is being held instead at a private hangar owned by CSI Aviation near the Albuquerque international sunport. Billionaires have flushed the election with cash \u2013 roughly $1.9b to be exact, largely to the benefit of republican candidates like Trump. \u201cBillionaire campaign spending on this scale drowns out the voices and concerns of ordinary Americans. It is one of the most obvious and disturbing consequences of the growth of billionaire fortunes, as well as being a prime indicator that the system regulating campaign finance has collapsed,\u201d said David Kass, ATF\u2019s executive director. Voter enthusiasm is at a historical high for a presidential election, a Gallup poll found. Similar to November 2020, 70% of registered voters nationwide said that they were more enthusiastic than usual about voting now compared to March, when only 56% expressed enthusiasm. Trump\u2019s former attorney Kenneth Chesebro has been suspended from practicing law in New York. Chesboro was indicted on state racketeering and conspiracy charges over efforts to overturn Trump\u2019s defeat in the 2020 election in Georgia. Harris has received more endorsements today. Former New York mayor and 2020 presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg and the Economist have publicly expressed their support. Harris said on Thursday that Trump\u2019s comment that he would protect women \u201cwhether the women like it or not\u201d showed that the Republican presidential nominee does not understand women\u2019s \u201cagency, their authority, their right and their ability to make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s offensive to everybody, by the way,\u201d Harris said before she set out to spend the day campaigning in the western swing states of Arizona and Nevada. Harris will be joined by Jennifer Lopez for her rally in Las Vegas, Nevada - a critical swing state. Ex-Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson will interview Trump in Arizona before the former president heads to his own rally in Nevada. Of the more than 60 million Americans who have gone to the polls early \u2013 some 32 million and counting did so in person. Here are some of the best pictures of early voting from the newswires: Tim Keller, the mayor of Albuquerque, where Trump is holding a rally, said last Friday that the Republican presidential candidate owes the city hundreds of thousands of dollars in bills from his last visit. \u201cTrump now owes almost a half a million dollars to the city of Albuquerque \u2026 We\u2019ve had collection agencies calling and so forth for about two years now,\u201d Keller said. The Trump campaign owed the city $200,000 for when he hosted his last rally at its convention center in 2019, which has climbed to almost $445,000 with interest. The costs covered police coverage, barricades and other expenses. Since the Trump campaign still allegedly hasn\u2019t paid its bills, he was banned from rallying there. Instead, the rally is being held at a private hangar owned by CSI Aviation near the Albuquerque international sunport. The general manager for the Albuquerque convention center, Ray Roa, confirmed to the Albuquerque Journal on Monday that members of the Trump campaign contacted them to try to rent the convention center but were denied. Trump called his supporters smarter than \u201ccrooked Joe\u2019s or lyin\u2019 Kamala\u2019s\u201d and denounced Joe Biden over his \u201cgarbage\u201d remark. Trump took several digs at his opponent, telling his crowd that Harris \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the stamina, the intellect or that special quality\u201d that certain leaders have. Trump called the US \u201can occupied country\u201d of illegal immigrants. \u201cOn day one, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cWe will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail or kick them the hell out of our country, and fast.\u201d Trump also promised to end sanctuary cities across the country. Donald Trump has been holding a rally in Albuquerque, New Mexico, a region he said \u201chas some of the worst border problems\u201d. \u201dIf you voted against me, shame on you,\u201d Trump told his crowd. In addition to calling Kamala Harris \u201cgrossly incompetent\u201d, Trump falsely said Harris imports criminals and mental institute patients into the US. He said \u201crough and tough hombres\u201d were coming across the border, a callback to a comment he made in 2016 during a debate with the then Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton about male drug dealers allegedly crossing the southern border illegally: \u201cWe have some bad hombres here and we\u2019re gonna to get \u2018em out.\u201d The Trump campaign has rebuked Harris-Walz surrogate Mark Cuban for comments he made about women on Thursday during an appearance on The View. \u201cDonald Trump \u2013 you never see him around strong, intelligent women ever,\u201d Cuban said when discussing Trump\u2019s former primary opponent Nikki Haley and the women working Trump\u2019s campaign and in his former administration. \u201cIt\u2019s just that simple: they\u2019re intimidating to him. He doesn\u2019t like to be challenged by them.\u201d The Trump campaign said in a statement in response: \u201cJoe Biden called Trump supporters garbage, and now, Kamala\u2019s top surrogate Mark Cuban insinuated female Trump supporters are \u2018weak and dumb.\u2019 This is extremely insulting to the thousands of women who work for President Trump, and the tens of millions of women who are voting for him. These women are mothers, entrepreneurs, and industry leaders and they are, indeed, strong AND intelligent, despite what Mark Cuban and Kamala Harris say.\u201d Michael Bloomberg has announced he voted for Kamala Harris. The former New York City mayor, who governed as a Republican and as an independent, and who was also a Democratic presidential candidate in 2020, wrote in an article for his own news media company, Bloomberg News, that he voted for Harris \u201cwithout hesitation\u201d. Bloomberg said that although he disagreed with Harris on some issues, he applauded a number of her policies including women\u2019s reproductive rights, immigration, gun safety, and the climate crisis. Bloomberg called the US \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest nation\u201d and said Trump made it \u201clook like a banana republic\u201d when he tried to overturn the results of the election and incite violence on 6 January at the Capitol. Bloomberg added: \u201cMost Americans never thought we\u2019d witness such a shameful episode. Trump, rather than apologizing for it \u2013 as some of those convicted of January 6-related crimes have done \u2013 celebrates it.\u201d Bloomberg concluded with an ask to \u201cundecided voters of all political stripes\u201d to join him in voting for Harris. Where are the presidential and vice-presidential candidates campaigning today? Kamala Harris is campaigning in Nevada and Arizona, with rallies planned in Reno, Las Vegas, and Phoenix, according to her campaign. Governor Tim Walz delivered remarks at a campaign event in Bucks County, Pennsylvania this morning and then will make a local stop in Erie, Pennsylvania, per the campaign. Donald Trump will be hosting rallies in New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona today, per his campaign. Senator JD Vance attended a town hall at High Point University in North Carolina this morning. The Economist magazine announced their endorsement of Kamala Harris on Thursday. In the statement, editors at the Economist wrote: Tens of millions of Americans will vote for Mr Trump next week. Some will be true believers. But many will take a calculated risk that in office his worst instincts would be constrained. We see that as recklessly complacent. By making Mr Trump leader of the free world, Americans would be gambling with the economy, the rule of law and international peace. Ms Harris\u2019s shortcomings, by contrast, are ordinary. And none of them are disqualifying. If The Economist had a vote, we would cast it for her. New poll shows presidential race pretty much deadlocked in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan. The surveys, conducted by UMass Lowell/YouGov and released today, found that in North Carolina Donald Trump was leading Kamala Harris 47% to 45%. In Pennsylvania, Harris is leading Trump, 48% to 47%, and in Michigan, Harris received 49% of the support among likely voters surveyed compared with 45% for Trump, well within the survey\u2019s margin of error. A state appeals court in New York ruled on Thursday that Kenneth Chesebro \u2013 the attorney who allegedly devised the \u201cfake electors\u201d plan to prevent Joe Biden from winning the 2020 election \u2013 will have his law license suspended. Last year, in August, Chesebro was indicted, along with Trump and 17 others in Georgia on state racketeering and conspiracy charges over efforts to overturn Trump\u2019s defeat in the 2020 election there. In October, Chesebro accepted a plea deal. With just days before the US presidential election, Guardian reporters Oliver Laughland and Joel Van Haren visited communities in Pennsylvania with the most on the line. Watch here: Voter enthusiasm is high for this presidential election, according to a new Gallup poll. The poll, released on Thursday, found that 70% of registered voters nationwide said that they were more enthusiastic than usual about voting, up from 56% in March. The increase was largely a result of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents expressing heightened enthusiasm for Kamala Harris after Joe Biden dropped out of the race, the survey states. 70% enthusiasm is also one percentage point higher than what Gallup measured at the close of the 2020 election. Americans\u2019 attention to the election is also relatively high, the poll writes, with 83% of registered voters and 77% of US adults saying they have given \u201cquite a lot of thought\u201d to the election. More than 60 million Americans have already voted in the 2024 election. With just five days until election day, 60.9 million people in the US have voted early as of Thursday at noon, according to the Election Lab at the University of Florida. Of the nearly 61 million, just over 32 million voted early in person and about 28 million voted early by mail. Cardi B will join Kamala Harris at a rally in Wisconsin on Friday. The Harris campaign announced today that rapper Cardi B will be delivering remarks to voters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, tomorrow. It is unclear whether she will perform, or just talk. The rally in Milwaukee will also feature performances by GloRilla, Flo Milli, MC Lyte, the Isley Brothers and DJ Gemini Gilly. Donald Trump is hitting back at Kamala Harris after she said that he wanted to end the Affordable Care Act, also known as \u2018\u201cObamacare\u201d . On Truth Social on Thursday, Trump said that he \u201cnever mentioned\u201d ending the Affordable Care Act, adding that he has \u201cnever even thought about such a thing\u201d. But, during his presidency, Trump repeatedly tried to terminate and replace the Affordable Care Act. In 2017, Trump tweeted to \u201clet ObamaCare implode\u201d after the Senate failed to pass a trimmed-down Affordable Care Act repeal bill that Trump had supported. In 2020, Trump\u2019s administration asked for the supreme court to terminate the Affordable Care Act, and in 2019, the justice department under Trump\u2019s administration backed a Texas judge\u2019s ruling that Obamacare was unconstitutional. And more recently, during the presidential debate with Harris, Trump called Obamacare \u201clousy\u201d adding: \u201cWe are going to replace it.\u201d Kamala Harris hit back at Donald Trump\u2019s comments last night about how he will \u201cprotect\u201d women, \u201cwhether the women like it or not\u201d. Harris told reporters: \u201cIt actually is, I think, very offensive to women in terms of not understanding their agency, their authority, their right and their ability to make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies. Harris said Trump\u2019s comments were \u201cjust the latest on a series of reveals by the former president on how he thinks about women and their agency\u201d. She added: \u201cWhether he has said, as he has, that women should be punished for their choices, whether he has talked about his pride is taking away a fundamental right of women, whether it be how he has actually created a situation in America where one in three women lives in a Trump abortion ban state.\u201d It\u2019s a Saturday afternoon at Al Madina Halal market and restaurant in Norcross, Georgia, and the line is four people deep for shawarma sandwiches or leg of lamb with saffron rice and two sides. A television on the wall by a group of tables has Al Jazeera correspondents reporting from several countries on a split screen about Israel\u2019s attack on Iranian military targets the day before. Mohammad Hejja is drinking yogurt, surveying the bustle in the store he bought in 2012. There are shoppers and employees from Sudan, Ethiopia, Iran, Pakistan, Morocco and other countries \u2013 a clear sign of what makes surrounding Gwinnett county, with nearly a million residents, the most diverse in the south-east. Hejja has Jordanian and US citizenship, but his family is Palestinian. Soldiers of the nascent nation of Israel drove his grandparents out of Palestine in the 1948 Nakba \u2013 the Palestinian catastrophe caused by Israel\u2019s creation. Asked about how he expects his community to vote when Americans head to the polls next week, he says: \u201cEverybody is confused about this election.\u201d His No 1 concern is to \u201cstop the war\u201d, referring to Israel\u2019s ongoing bombardment of Gaza and recent attacks on Lebanon. The issue is top of mind for Arab American voters nationwide. Some polls suggest Arab Americans could abandon the Democrats in droves over the Biden administration\u2019s support for Israel; elsewhere, advocates and community leaders are urgently organizing to prevent a Donald Trump victory, warning about impacts in the Middle East and on domestic issues such as immigration if the GOP candidate is re-elected. Abdullah Hammoud, mayor of Dearborn, Michigan, wrote on X in response to Clinton\u2019s speech: \u201cDo us a favor \u2013 stop sending surrogates who have no respect or regard for this community. You\u2019re only inflicting more damage.\u201d Georgia state representative and Palestinian American Ruwa Romman said in response to Clinton\u2019s speech she was \u201cso ready for this generation to step aside\u201d. Romman hoped to speak at the Democratic national convention this summer as a representative of the Palestinian American community but that request was ultimately denied, a move that upset Arab and Muslim American political groups. Shortly after Romman was denied a speaking slot, Muslim Women for Harris-Walz withdrew their support for Harris and disbanded. Polls show Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are neck and neck in Michigan, a state home to the one of the US\u2019s largest Arab populations, many of whom are mourning the losses of family members killed by Israeli forces abroad in Palestine and Lebanon. Former president Bill Clinton made a speech in support of Harris in the key swing state last night addressing these voters, and said: \u201cI understand why young Palestinian and Arab Americans in Michigan think too many people have died \u2013 I get that,\u201d Clinton said before adding: \u201cHamas makes sure that they\u2019re shielded by civilians. They\u2019ll force you to kill civilians if you want to defend yourself.\u201d One recent poll showed Arabs favor Trump slightly more than Harris, a likely reaction to the Biden administration\u2019s Middle East policy and \u201crock solid\u201d, \u201cunwavering\u201d and \u201cironclad\u201d support for Israel. Pictures of the ballots that were set on fire in Washington and Oregon earlier this week have been released. Election staff in Washington\u2019s Clark county identified the 488 voters with damaged ballots, 345 of whom have requested new ballots. The remaining 143 replacement ballots will be mailed out today. Officials fear the suspect, a white man of medium or thin build between 30 and 40 years old, who is balding or has very short hair, may intend to strike again. Bob Day, the police chief of Portland, Oregon, said the said the welding on the incendiary devices found inside the ballot boxes is \u201cvery detailed \u2026 it\u2019s really quality, so this person obviously has some skills in that area\u201d. Elon Musk is one of the billionaires who shelled out large sums of money in support of the Republican party. The tech billionaire known for SpaceX and Tesla gave $133m to America Pac, a Super Pac he created to support Donald Trump. But Musk\u2019s campaign tactics have gotten him into trouble. The America Pac has been giving a $1m cash prize away each day until election day on 5 November to a person in a swing state if they pledged to support the first and second amendments. The justice department warned Musk that offering a monetary incentive to voters was illegal and he might be breaking the law. Larry Krasner, the Democratic district attorney of Philadelphia, brought the first legal action against Musk, arguing it is an illegal lottery which violates state consumer protection laws. Musk on Wednesday night sought to have the case brought to federal court. A lot of money has been spent on this year\u2019s elections. Only 150 billionaire families have contributed $1.9bn in support of presidential and congressional candidates, according to a new report from Americans for Tax Fairness. Of this giant figure 72% went to support Republicans compared with the 22% spent on Democrats. \u201cBillionaire campaign spending on this scale drowns out the voices and concerns of ordinary Americans. It is one of the most obvious and disturbing consequences of the growth of billionaire fortunes, as well as being a prime indicator that the system regulating campaign finance has collapsed,\u201d said David Kass, ATF\u2019s executive director. \u201cWe need to rein in the political power of billionaire families by better taxing them and by effectively limiting their campaign donations. Until we do both, we can only expect the influence of the super-rich over our politics and government to escalate.\u201d A new Washington Post poll has found that Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are tied in toss-up state Michigan. Harris has 47% support among likely voters while Trump has 46% support. \u201dBoth margins are within the poll\u2019s margin of error of 3.7 percentage points, indicating either candidate could hold a lead,\u201d the newspaper said. With 50.6% of the vote, Joe Biden won the midwest state in 2020 compared to the 47.8% who voted for Trump. Trump narrowly won Michigan in 2016 by a little less than 11,000 votes. After the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, America\u2019s business leaders came out strongly in their criticism of Donald Trump. Now \u2013 as the Harris campaign brands Trump a \u201cfascist\u201d and Trump threatens retribution against \u201cthe enemy within\u201d \u2013 there appears to be a conspiracy of silence. In fact, as the nation heads to the polls in an election that is too close to call, some of America\u2019s most powerful chief executives appear to be cozying up to Trump again. In public, only a small handful of business leaders are backing Trump. In private it\u2019s a different story. At least, that\u2019s how Trump is telling it. Most gamblers might want to sit out the US election. It\u2019s too close to call with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump neck and neck, according to official polls. But the former president\u2019s campaign has latched on to signs he says prove he\u2019s actually \u201cleading\u201d. In a close race, Trump and his allies claim some \u201cgambling polls\u201d, as he described them last week, put him significantly ahead of Harris. \u201cLike, 65 to 35, or something like that.\u201d The irony of touting an apparent lead in betting markets at a Believers and Ballots campaign event in Georgia aimed at Christian voters was not lost on Trump. \u201cBut nobody here gambles,\u201d he continued. \u201cDoes anybody here gamble? No, no, no, no. Great Christians don\u2019t gamble, do they? Oh no.\u201d Lots of memes and tweets and posts and videos are popping up, assuring women that they can keep their votes secret from their husbands and boyfriends. The unspoken assumption is that lots of women are bullied, intimidated or controlled by their partners, specifically in straight couples when she wants to vote for Harris and he supports Trump. The messages assure these intimidated voters that they can vote in peace and privacy at a polling place. But a lot of Americans now vote by mail, which generally means they fill out their ballots at home, where that privacy may not be available. On the one hand, I\u2019m glad there\u2019s outreach to those voters. On the other, the way these messages are framed seem to regard the grim reality that a lot of women live in fear of their spouses as a given hardly worth stating outright, let alone decrying \u2026 Donald Trump says he will \u201cprotect women\u201d if he wins power, but previous remarks and behaviour suggest otherwise: Since the 1970s, about 26 women have accused Donald Trump of sexual misconduct. The allegations include: rape, intruding on naked teenage pageant contestants, kissing and groping without consent, and looking under women\u2019s skirts. Trump was found liable for sexually abusing and defaming E Jean Carroll. Trump\u2019s counterclaim was rejected by a judge in New York, Lewis A Kaplan, who said that the allegation that Trump raped Carroll was \u201csubstantially true\u201d. As well as being an adjudicated rapist, Trump has made a litany of sexist comments throughout his public life. In an interview with Esquire Magazine in 1991, Trump said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter what [the media] write as long as you\u2019ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.\u201d In a leaked recording from 2005, Trump told Billy Bush that, \u201cwhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\u201d He adds seconds later: \u201cGrab them by the pussy. You can do anything.\u201d On a 2013 episode of Celebrity Apprentice, Trump said: \u201cIt must be a pretty picture, you dropping to your knees\u201d to a female contestant. His tendency to make misogynistic remarks does not seem to be abating. Only in August did the former president suggest Harris had traded sexual favours to advance her political career. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will travel out west in the US election race on Thursday, as opportunities to edge ahead are running out. Both candidates are trying to get Latino voters to support them. Harris has secured the star power of Jennifer Lopez for her rally in Las Vegas, Nevada, a critical swing state. Meanwhile, ex-Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson will interview Trump in Arizona before the former president heads to his own rally in Nevada. A stand-up comedy set performed at Trump\u2019s rally at Madison Square Garden is still reverberating throughout this campaign. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe likened Puerto Rico to a floating island of garbage, which Harris\u2019 campaign has seized upon, claiming that it reveals the racism of Trump supporters. This was gaining traction, but President Joe Biden still managed to make it backfire on his party when he appeared to describe all Trump supporters as \u201cgarbage.\u201d This prompted Trump, who has also branded Harris\u2019 supporters as garbage, to use a garbage truck in a publicity stunt in Wisconsin. Trump is due to deviate slightly from campaigning in battleground states with a trip to New Mexico on Thursday, a state pollsters forecast will go to Harris. The concept of \u201celite overproduction\u201d was developed by social scientist Peter Turchin around the turn of this century to describe something specific: too many rich people for not enough rich-person jobs. It\u2019s a byproduct of inequality: a ton of poor people, sure, but also a superfluity of the wealthy, without enough positions to house them in the influence and status to which they think themselves entitled. In a modern context, that would mean senior positions in the government and civil service, along with the top tier of finance and law, but Turchin tested the hypothesis from ancient Rome to 19th-century Britain. The names and nature of the contested jobs and titles changed; the pattern remained. Turchin predicted in 2010 that by the 2020s it would be destabilising US politics \u2026 Kamala Harris may never have visited Thulasendrapuram, a sleepy village in south India, but its residents claim to be some of her most devoted fans. It was here, in among the verdant rice paddies and groundnut farms of rural Tamil Nadu, that Harris\u2019s grandfather PV Gopalan was born. Though more than a century has passed since then, residents have proudly claimed Harris as a \u201cdaughter of the land\u201d. The outcome of the US election next week, where Harris is running as the Democrat party\u2019s presidential nominee, has the community on edge. At the local tea shop, gossip has been pushed to one side to make way for chatter over the challenges posed by Harris\u2019s opponent Donald Trump and the trends from crucial swing states. Good morning. It is less than a week before polls close at the 2024 US election and more than 57.5 million Americans have already checked their ballots, according to the Election Lab at the University of Florida. Presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are still hot on the campaign trail in a fiercely contested race that is too close to call. Trump made an appearance in a high-vis vest at the wheel of a garbage truck before heading off to a rally in Wisconsin, a key battleground state. Trump promised to protect women \u201cwhether they liked it or not\u201d. Harris was also in Wisconsin offering platitudes on climate change, gun control and abortion. She said those issues were \u201cnot political\u201d but one\u2019s \u201clived experience\u201d. She was speaking shortly after the latest CNN poll showed her six points ahead of Trump in the state. Harris and Trump take their nail-biting White House race west later, seeking supremacy on border security and aiming to woo crucial Latino voters days ahead of the US election. Pop singer Jennifer Lopez will bring her star power to the stage for Harris in Las Vegas, as the candidates battle through the seven swing states expected to decide the next president. Meanwhile, Trump has scheduled an interview in Arizona with ex-Fox News host Tucker Carlson and a rally in Nevada. On Wednesday, Harris spoke in Harrisburg, the Pennsylvania state capital, one of few counties that voted for Joe Biden in 2020. Polls show a tied race in Pennsylvania. Arnold Schwarzenegger has announced that he is backing Harris in next week\u2019s election. Schwarzenegger, 77, said that while he doesn\u2019t \u201creally do endorsements\u201d, he felt compelled to formally endorse Harris and her pick for vice-president, Tim Walz. Trump refused to apologise for the comments made about Puerto Rico at his Madison Square Garden rally. \u201cHe\u2019s a comedian, what can I tell you? I know nothing about him. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s there.\u201d A Pennsylvania judge on Wednesday sided with Trump\u2019s campaign and agreed to extend an in-person voting option in suburban Philadelphia, where long lines on the final day led to complaints voters were being disfranchised by an unprepared election office. A majority of voters in swing states do not believe Trump will accept defeat if he loses next week\u2019s presidential election and fear that his supporters will turn to violence in an attempt to install him in power, a new poll suggests.",

Tong conveys the wide-eyed awe and gullibility of a girl in her mid-teens, but also subtly adds layers of maturity and weariness as the play progresses. Wu is terrific in a wilder, more unpredictable part, mercurial and edgy but also touchingly vulnerable and lost.<br><br>After a long opening scene of negotiation folded into the shock of loss, Golden Blood settles into a jolting, rapid-fire rhythm \u2013 he indulges in increasingly hare-brained money making schemes, first as the \u201cking of ketamine\u201d and then as the \u201cgod of gold\u201d, and she gets pulled unwillingly along. While this has an undeniable dynamism, Leong\u2019s overemphasis on raucousness and ribaldry crowds out the more contemplative aspects of the script.<br><br>Michael Hankin\u2019s set, with its coloured walls and scattered red plastic chairs, doesn\u2019t help much. The apartment interior is completely abstracted save for a rudimentary set of shelves and a foldable mattress, bleeding the play of detail. Singapore\u2019s seedy underbelly, mentioned in the program notes, has to be inferred by the audience because it isn\u2019t on the stage; missing is the tactile specificity needed to bring this world to life. Fausto Brusamolino\u2019s lighting is vivid and energetic, and Rainbow Chan\u2019s sound design goes some way in suggesting a wider context.</p>    <p>Golden Blood has a lot on its mind. Key to the play is a tension between family and self-preservation, between the broken inheritance of the past and the uncharted waters of the future. Some of its plot elements \u2013 notably the under-realised gangsterism and a late act of betrayal that undercuts the central relationship \u2013 are hesitant and slightly pulpy. But there are some brilliant observations on lineage and intergenerational trauma, and the sibling dynamics are powerfully articulated.<br><br>If ritual is inherently theatrical, then theatre is inherently ritualistic; the stage is a place for carving out sacred space, honouring ceremony and communing with the dead. Golden Blood is critical of, and also sympathetic to, the practice of burning paper products for lost loved ones. Here, grief seems like a transactional process, and spirituality akin to materialism. But Tong is a compassionate and canny observer; her siblings may be cut adrift from their traditions, but they honour them nonetheless. Because burning things doesn\u2019t necessarily make them go away.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.mtc.com.au/plays-and-tickets/whats-on/season-2024/golden-blood/\">Golden Blood</a> is at Fairfax Studio, Arts Centre Melbourne, until 30 November</em></p></li> </ul>",

For these kids, raised on strict notions of respect but also neglected and perhaps even abused, this becomes an almost Sisyphean task. The girl wants to understand her occluded past better, even though the person who could best explain is dead; the boy, who remembers more and is therefore more obviously damaged, wants largely to forget. Tessa Leong directs this sharply observed and often very funny two-hander with enormous energy and verve, eliciting fine performances from her cast. Tong conveys the wide-eyed awe and gullibility of a girl in her mid-teens, but also subtly adds layers of maturity and weariness as the play progresses. Wu is terrific in a wilder, more unpredictable part, mercurial and edgy but also touchingly vulnerable and lost. After a long opening scene of negotiation folded into the shock of loss, Golden Blood settles into a jolting, rapid-fire rhythm \u2013 he indulges in increasingly hare-brained money making schemes, first as the \u201cking of ketamine\u201d and then as the \u201cgod of gold\u201d, and she gets pulled unwillingly along. While this has an undeniable dynamism, Leong\u2019s overemphasis on raucousness and ribaldry crowds out the more contemplative aspects of the script. Michael Hankin\u2019s set, with its coloured walls and scattered red plastic chairs, doesn\u2019t help much. The apartment interior is completely abstracted save for a rudimentary set of shelves and a foldable mattress, bleeding the play of detail. Singapore\u2019s seedy underbelly, mentioned in the program notes, has to be inferred by the audience because it isn\u2019t on the stage; missing is the tactile specificity needed to bring this world to life. Fausto Brusamolino\u2019s lighting is vivid and energetic, and Rainbow Chan\u2019s sound design goes some way in suggesting a wider context. Golden Blood has a lot on its mind. Key to the play is a tension between family and self-preservation, between the broken inheritance of the past and the uncharted waters of the future. Some of its plot elements \u2013 notably the under-realised gangsterism and a late act of betrayal that undercuts the central relationship \u2013 are hesitant and slightly pulpy. But there are some brilliant observations on lineage and intergenerational trauma, and the sibling dynamics are powerfully articulated. If ritual is inherently theatrical, then theatre is inherently ritualistic; the stage is a place for carving out sacred space, honouring ceremony and communing with the dead. Golden Blood is critical of, and also sympathetic to, the practice of burning paper products for lost loved ones. Here, grief seems like a transactional process, and spirituality akin to materialism. But Tong is a compassionate and canny observer; her siblings may be cut adrift from their traditions, but they honour them nonetheless. Because burning things doesn\u2019t necessarily make them go away. Golden Blood is at Fairfax Studio, Arts Centre Melbourne, until 30 November",

The premier, David Crisafulli, has confirmed the LNP would, as promised during the election campaign, end planning for a proposed 5GW Pioneer Burdekin pumped hydro scheme that would have constructed a massive energy storage dam in central Queensland. The LNP criticised the project as \u201cnot feasible\u201d and a \u201choax\u201d. It has said it will now \u201cinvestigate opportunities for smaller, more manageable pumped hydro projects\u201d. Those could include privately funded projects, or government-backed construction. The Queensland Conservation Council said the new government should release details of those plans as a priority, within the first 100 days of government, given how critical such storage projects were to meeting energy transition targets. The Crisafulli government also committed to meeting Labor\u2019s renewable energy targets, which require 50% of the state\u2019s generation to be sourced by renewables by 2030; 70% by 2032; and 80% by 2035. Long-duration storage would be required to meet those targets. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that the new state government is upfront about which pumped hydro projects they\u2019re considering,\u201d said Dave Copeman, the director of the Queensland Conservation Council. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cQueenslanders want to know they\u2019re serious about getting on with the energy transition, but also, critically, we need to be able to assess the potential environmental impacts of their plans.\u201d Government sources and experts have said the Pioneer Burdekin site was ideal for pumped hydro storage, but the plan had met with significant local opposition. Others have questioned the lack of detail, including the total cost, of the project. Dr Dylan McConnell, an energy systems analyst at the University of New South Wales, told Guardian Australia during the election campaign that mega projects such as the Pioneer Burdekin would probably result in cost blowouts and delays. He said several smaller projects could help \u201cdiversify the risk\u201d of delays; but that the falling cost of batteries could mean that, by the time pumped hydro projects were built, \u201cit could be cheaper to build chemical storage\u201d. Copeman said the QCC had sought more transparency from the previous state government about why it chose the Pioneer Burdekin project. \u201cTransparency is vital so Queenslanders can make an informed decision,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, the debate about Pioneer Burdekin became a political one as opposed to one based on data. \u201cWe absolutely support the energy transition because climate change is one of the biggest threats to our biodiversity and the places that Queenslanders love, but development needs to be well planned and done right. \u201cThe worst outcome would be if the cumulative environmental impact and cost of building multiple smaller pumped hydro projects is significantly greater. \u201cWe can\u2019t know that until the LNP government is upfront about their plans.\u201d Crisafulli has said the new government may look to \u201cpartner with\u201d proponents of smaller pumped hydro projects already in the pipeline, and to bring these online sooner than Pioneer Burdekin would have been. The new government remains supportive of the 2GW Borumba pumped hydro project, which has progressed further than Pioneer Burdekin, and is already at the early works phase. It is understood the state has already acquired more than 50 properties as part of its planning to build Pioneer Burdekin. \u201cWe are working through the process [with landholders] \u2026 but it\u2019s going to be what the people want,\u201d the deputy premier, Jarrod Bleijie, said. \u201cI have asked the department and Queensland Hydro to \u2026 stop any progress on that project, which they have done.\u201d",

In his first ODI since 2021, Lewis made 102 not out from 60 balls in Pallekele, before following it up with a magnificent innings against England. The 32-year-old struck eight sixes with only five fours, and lifted Turner for two sixes that sailed over the party stand at square leg, before check-driving Archer over mid-on in a show of real quality. Livingstone and Adil Rashid would go on to dismiss Brandon King and Lewis respectively to ensure their side didn\u2019t go down by 10 wickets, but it was an altogether chastening day for England\u2019s latest new-era of white-ball cricket.",

Seales has the sort of figures Sir Curtly used to collect: 5-1-8-2.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6723d1808f0821f410fab344\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-31T18:52:04.159Z\">6.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">WICKET!

Another week, another continent, as The Only Ones so nearly sang. Five days after collapsing in a heap in Pakistan, England now have the chance to do it again in a different format in the Caribbean. I was going to say a shorter format, but that is now debatable. They will be hoping to stay in a bit longer than the 37 overs they managed the other day. As Brian Johnston used to observe, it\u2019s a funny game.</p> <p>It was less than a year ago that West Indies and England last met in an ODI at the Viv. We should really have a prize for anyone who can remember what happened. A glance at <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/england-tour-of-west-indies-2023-24-1373558/west-indies-vs-england-2nd-odi-1373577/full-scorecard\">the scorecard</a> shows that England won, with Liam Livingstone and Rehan Ahmed taking the wickets and Will Jacks, Harry Brook and Jos Buttler knocking off the runs. </p> <p>Buttler is now injured and Brook rested, but the others are in the squad and Livingstone is about to become England\u2019s sixth captain of the calendar year, which should at least stop him moaning about being too low in the order.</p> <p>England\u2019s line-up may well be a hotch-potch. The selectors seem to have reacted to the absence of the usual suspects by refusing to include any specialist batters. The top order could be a curious blend of wicketkeepers and slow-bowling all-rounders, although the attack makes up for any lack of experience with Jofra Archer, Reece Topley, Sam Curran and the great Adil Rashid. </p> <p>West Indies, by contrast, can field a settled side, captained by Shai Hope and starring the explosive Evin Lewis. Play starts at 6pm GMT, weather permitting \u2013 there\u2019s a bit of thunder in the air. See you just after 5.30 with news of the toss and (I hope) the teams.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Cameron Ponsonby is in Antigua with the full report: Liam Livingstone\u2019s reaction I guess we need to get the rhythm of 50-over cricket as quickly as possible. We know that somebody in the top six has to go on and unfortunately we couldn\u2019t do that today. I don\u2019t think we adapted that well. West Indies bowled really well and we lost wickets at key stages. Disappointing day but we\u2019ll come back on Sunday, Saturday, whenever it is! I think everybody saw what JT [John Turner] is about. I thought he bowled really well and was unlucky not to get a wicket which might have changed the game. Hopefully more of the same for the rest of the series. 25.5 overs: West Indies 159-2 (Carty 19, Hope 6) Hope turns Livingstone for two to complete a thumping victory for West Indies. They bowled cleverly to restrict England to an under-par 209; then, either side of a rain delay, Evin Lewis hit a coruscating 94 to take them to the cusp of victory. 25th over: West Indies 153-2 (Carty 18, Hope 3) Carty blooters Rashid over mid-off for four to move West Indies within a boundary of victory. It\u2019s been a hammering. 24th over: West Indies 148-2 (Carty 14, Hope 2) Hope is dropped at extra cover by Rashid, a fairly simple chance off the bowling of Livingstone. Maybe he lost the flight of the ball because he barely got a hand on it. 23rd over: West Indies 146-2 (Carty 13, Hope 1) Eleven to win. Evin Lewis dies by the sword. He tried to reach a century with his ninth six, didn\u2019t quite get hold of the shot and was well caught at long off by Bethell. Earlier in the over he\u2019d pulled Rashid over midwicket for another six, then survived a desperate LBW review from a ball that pitched outside leg. No century but Lewis has won the game for his team with a truly brilliant innings: 94 from 69 balls with eight sixes. 22nd over: West Indies 138-1 (Lewis 88, Carty 12) Lewis moves closer to three figures by dragging a sweep very fine for four. None of the England players were able to score at a strike rate of over 100; Lewis is going at 133. 21st over: West Indies 129-1 (Lewis 82, Carty 9) Rashid returns and concedes a couple from his fifth over. West Indies need 28, Lewis needs 18 for back-to-back ODI hundreds. 20th over: West Indies 127-1 (Lewis 81, Carty 8) The new batter Keacy Carty makes his intentions clear by sweeping Livingstone for three and spanking a one-bounce four down the ground. West Indies need 30 to win. King\u2019s luck finally runs out when he hoicks Livingstone straight to Jacks at deep midwicket. Like everyone in this game apart from Lewis and Livingstone, he really struggled to time the ball on a two-paced pitch. 19th over: West Indies 118-0 (King 30, Lewis 80) Jacob Bethell comes on for Adil Rashid, who has somehow ended up with figures of 4-0-35-0, and is monstered over long-off for Lewis. That\u2019s his seventh sixth. For various reasons this is only Lewis\u2019s second ODI since 2021; in the other, against Sri Lanka earlier in the week, he walloped 102 off 61 balls. 18th over: West Indies 106-0 (King 27, Lewis 69) There\u2019s no doubt West Indies won a good toss; there\u2019s also no doubt they have completely outplayed England, who have a bit to think about before the second game on this ground on Saturday. 17th over: West Indies 104-0 (King 27, Lewis 69) King, who has ridden his luck like Willie Shoemaker in this innings, edges Rashid past slip at catchable height for three more. The rotation of strike works out just fine for West Indies. Lewis to pull Rashid for two boundaries in three balls before dumping a full toss over midwicket for six! In the context of a low-scoring game, this is some performance: 69 not out from 54 balls with three fours and six sixes. 16th over: West Indies 87-0 (King 24, Lewis 55) Evin Lewis clatters Livingstone\u2019s final delivery wide of the man at long-off. He has played brilliantly on a pitch that has confounded everyone else. Brandon King successfully reviews after being given out LBW to Liam Livingstone. He missed a pull at a ball that skidded on to hit him in front, but it pitched just outside leg so King survives. The players are back on the field and suddenly life has meaning again. Play will restart at 1.10am and West Indies have a revised target of 157 in 35 overs. That means they need 76 from 120 balls to win. I mean you\u2019ve got to say they\u2019ve a chance. The covers are coming off and there unconfirmed reports of imminent cricket. Maybe England will dodge defeat after all. The rain has returned in Antigua and, though there is plenty of time to spare, West Indies need to bat 20 overs for DLS to come into play. 15th over: West Indies 81-0 (King 23, Lewis 51) England are facing a hammering here but they\u2019ve bowled pretty well and had no luck. King edges Rashid past slip at catchable height, then survives an LBW review after failing to pick the googly. He was saved by the ball hitting him just outside the line of off stump. 14th over: West Indies 77-0 (King 20, Lewis 50) A terrific yorker from Curran is dug out well by Lewis, who was almost knocked off his feet. He works the next delivery off middle stump to fine leg for his first four, then takes a quick single to reach a punishing 46-ball fifty. It\u2019s been a cracking innings. 13th over: West Indies 71-0 (King 19, Lewis 45) The required rate is below four, which means West Indies can sit on the dangerous Rashid. Or they could hit him for a one-handed six, as Lewis has just done. He didn\u2019t get hold of it properly but it had just enough to clear the rope at cow corner. That\u2019s Lewis\u2019s fifth boundary, all of them sixes. 12th over: West Indies 61-0 (King 18, Lewis 37) Sam Curran replaces John Turner, starts with three dot balls to Lewis and then sees his fourth smashed over midwicket for a huge six. Lewis has is dealing exclusively in sixes and singles right now. 11th over: West Indies 54-0 (King 18, Lewis 30) Adil Rashid usually comes on straight after the Powerplay and today is no exception. King\u2019s charmed innings continues when a leading edge somehow loops over the head of extra cover. While he continues to ride his luck, Lewis looks in control and calmly drives singles off the three deliveries he faces. 10th over: West Indies 49-0 (King 16, Lewis 27) After bowling a couple of wides to Lewis, Turner beats King outside off stump yet again. Just one run off the bat in that over. Turner has bowled much better than figures of 5-0-26-0 would suggest. 9th over: West Indies 46-0 (King 16, Lewis 26) England need to take wickets so Archer is given a fifth over. File under \u2018one too many\u2019: Lewis drives handsomely over mid-on for his third six before King rifles an even better drive between extra cover and mid-off for four. Thirteen from the over; this game is probably done. 8th over: West Indies 33-0 (King 12, Lewis 17) Lewis hasn\u2019t middled many tonight, but when he does he\u2019s deadly. An outswinger from Turner, starting on leg stump, is picked up spectacularly over midwicket for six. That\u2019s a ridiculous shot. Lewis has form for administering this kind of punishment: he smashed 176 not out, with seven sixes, against England at the Oval in 2017. Turner recovers pretty well and ends the over by beating King for the umpteenth time. 7th over: West Indies 24-0 (King 11, Lewis 11) The left-handed Lewis is beaten by a stunning delivery from Archer that swings past the outside edge and just misses off stump. England have bowled beautifully so far, Archer in particular, and it\u2019s a travesty they haven\u2019t taken at least one wicket. Another maiden from Archer, whose figures are 4-2-8-0. \u201cAs usual, I\u2019m flummoxed by ODI field settings,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cCaptains seem to post the same fields regardless of the target set. England need 10 wickets to win this match and the first few overs is the likeliest time, so three slips, catching midwicket and a short leg? No. Just the bog standard one slip, two out and the rest in the ring. Ben Stokes does more with a field in five overs than an ODI captain does in 50.\u201d 6th over: West Indies 24-0 (King 11, Lewis 11) Turner beats King with four successive deliveries, the second of which was a snorter that burst from a length. Early days but you can see why England are so interested in him. The bounce he gets is particularly exciting. 5th over: West Indies 22-0 (King 10, Lewis 10) Archer\u2019s having no luck against King, who has inside-edged as many deliveries as he has middle. The frustration continues when King puts a rare bad ball away for four before Lewis is beaten by a wide yorker. 4th over: West Indies 17-0 (King 6, Lewis 10) Turner\u2019s run-up reminds me a little of Glenn McGrath, though his action is more chest-on. A previously excellent second over is ruined when Lewis swivel-pulls the last delivery round the corner for six. England need wickets plural. 3rd over: West Indies 9-0 (King 6, Lewis 2) King gets a thick inside-edge to another textbook inswinger from Archer, who is bowling stump to stump, just full of a good length. A maiden. \u201cI love your optimism that this will still be a 50-over game rather than the Windies beating our T20 team in less than 20 overs in what should be an ODI...\u201d writes Tom Van der Gucht. \u201cThen again, Turner will be an unknown quantity an me could catch them cold and Archer and Rashid are still Archer and Rashid.\u201d I\u2019m just dealing in facts; you can\u2019t get cancelled for facts. I do think West Indies will win but I\u2019m not sure they\u2019ll romp to victory unless the ball starts to skid on under the lights. 2nd over: West Indies 9-0 (King 6, Lewis 2) The mysterious John Turner, finally making his England debut almost a year after he was first included in a white-ball squad, will share the new ball. He starts with a terrific lifter that hits a slightly startled King on the arm. That sets the tone for a superb first over in which King edges at catchable height for four and also inside-edges a single on the leg side. 1st over: West Indies 4-0 (King 1, Lewis 2) Archer\u2019s second ball is a beautiful inswinger that Brandon King inside-edges past leg stump for a single. That was very similar to the ball with which he dismissed Aaron Finch for a golden duck in the 2019 semi-final. England need early wickets and will be encouraged by the swing that Archer is getting. Later in the over he tries a short ball that is cuffed for a couple by Evin Lewis. The outfield is painfully slow. We\u2019re back and Jofra Archer is about to bowl. And it\u2019s still a 50-over game. \u201cI hope John Turner is a spinner,\u201d writes Toby. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s not, and there\u2019s bad news about Eddie Paynter as well. The covers are back on. Tremendous. \u201cUSA are currently 242 for 8 after 43 overs, chasing 318 to beat Scotland in the Cricket World Cup League 2 series in Grand Prairie,\u201d writes Simon McMahon. \u201cBrandon \u2018Baz\u2019 McMullen made 151 for Scotland, his third ODI hundred and the fifth highest score for Scotland in ODIs.\u201d It became pretty obvious during the T20 World Cup, particularly in the Australia game, that he is a seriously good player. It sounds like the weather has improved in Antigua. No restart time as yet though. \u201cMurder On The Doorstep, eh?\u201d sniffs Damian Clarke. \u201cTempting. But an early night sounds a better option. Can I have your permission to finish my jigsaw, my bottle of wine, and the futility of my day?\u201d Ah gowan. Murder on the Doorstep is actually pretty interesting; there\u2019s a good BBC podcast series on it as well. Very strange story. Weather update: it\u2019s still raining It doesn\u2019t look as heavy as it was half an hour ago, although the view from Whitstable isn\u2019t the best so I might be wrong. What we can say with certainty is that there will be no play for the forseeable; even if it stops raining, the clean-up operation will take a while. \u201cIf it\u2019s anything like the downpour that we woke up to on Saba this morning, and which was apparently heading towards Antigua, play is well and truly over,\u201d writes Chris. \u201cBut, oh boy, do we need the rain in these parts. Better had it been yesterday or tomorrow, though.\u201d The rain should help the ball skid on when West Indies bat, which will make it even tougher for England to defend 209. You may wish to consider alternative entertainment; if you\u2019re in the UK, Murder on the Doorstep is on Channel 5 at 10pm. It\u2019s hooning down In case you missed it, England announced their new central contracts list earlier today. There were no big surprises. But read this piece anyway. It\u2019s raining. Tremendous. Hopefully it\u2019s just a passing shower. Thanks Tim, hello everyone. England\u2019s total feels below-par, even on such a sluggish pitch, and you\u2019d expect West Indies to get the job done. On the plus side \u2013 because there\u2019s always a plus side \u2013 we\u2019re finally going to see John Turner bowl for England. He averages less than 20 with the ball in all three forms, and if that statistic doesn\u2019t get you excited I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re dead inside. England kept half-getting going, then being pegged back. All their top six got to 15, and not one of them reached 50. Jacob Bethell and Jordan Cox offered a glimpse of star quality but only managed a pair of cameos. Liam Livingstone and Sam Curran showed their grit and nous by adding 68. But the innings belonged to West Indies \u2013 to Shai Hope for his astute captaincy, to Jayden Seales for his Curtly Ambrose impression, and above all to Gudakesh Motie for grabbing a four-for, including both the scalps that really mattered. That\u2019s my cue to go and see what\u2019s in the fridge. Thanks for your company and correspondence, which made up in quality what it perhaps lacked in volume. Do stick around to see what West Indies can make of this target, and what Rob Smyth makes of them. Rash flicks to midwicket, and that\u2019s it! Turner is left high and dry on 2. 45th over: England 209-9 (Rashid 15, Turner 2) As the lights get brighter, England hang in there and add to their collection of singles. 44th over: England 206-9 (Rashid 13, Turner 1) Archer got a huge top edge: as skyers go, that was the skyest. So Alzarri Joseph has a wicket at last and here is John Turner, the fast bowler who toured West Indies a year ago without getting a game. Some people have wondered whether he really exists, but if not, he\u2019s quite a convincing deep-fake. He gets off the mark first ball, unlike poor old Jamie Overton, with a neat deflection into the leg side. And yes, it\u2019s another skyer. 43rd over: England 200-8 (Rashid 12, Archer 3) If Adil Rashid hadn\u2019t been a joy to watch for so long with his googlies, he would have been a joy to watch with the bat. Facing Forde, he whips through midwicket, all wrists and no effort, for a much-needed four. He likes it so much, he does it again, flicking a full ball over square leg. Up comes the 200 and there are still seven overs to go. 42nd over: England 191-8 (Rashid 4, Archer 2) Alzarri Joseph produces a spicy bouncer which hits Jofra Archer somewhere near the collarbone. Archer doesn\u2019t seem too bothered as he jogs a leg-bye, but Ian Bishop says \u201cBrave man, bowling a bouncer to Archer.\u201d Maybe Joseph has worked out that he\u2019s unlikely to get a bat. 41st over: England 188-8 (Rashid 3, Archer 1) That was beautifully done by Motie, who gave the first ball of the over some flight, tempting Curran to go downtown. He did \u2013 straight to the man at long-on. He batted well but as he stomps off, he takes most of England\u2019s hopes with him. Motie finishes with magnificent figures, 10-0-41-4. Curran holes out! 40th over: England 187-7 (Curran 37, Rashid 3) A few more singles off Seales. \u201cHello again.\u201d Hello Tom van der Gucht. \u201cLivingstone holds a strange place in my affections whereby I sort of want him to be amazing and achieve the potential that might be there, but also feel frustrated at being underwhelmed by him so many times in the past when he\u2019s thrown it away when set. Yet, with Buttler\u2019s grasp on the captaincy at its weakest in memory, could this be Livingstone\u2019s chance to stake a claim (not just in the ODI team after being jettisoned) but as a mercurial talent who leads from the front with a swagger and cheeky grin? Just the sort of leader McCullum loves... \u201c 39th over: England 181-7 (Curran 34, Rashid 1) So that was two wickets in two balls for Gudakesh Motie, and England have collapsed again, losing three wickets for 16. Mousley played a slog-sweep into the wind; Overton played a regular sweep at thin air. On the plus side, Curran is still there. And Rash can bat. But 260 is looking almost impossible from here. Jamie Overton\u2019s ODI debut \u2026 and he\u2019s out first ball! He misses a straight one that keeps low. Maybe Rod Tucker thinks it\u2019s going under the stumps. Anyway, Hope reviews and he\u2019s spot on. Yes, it\u2019s another catch in the deep! 38th over: England 177-5 (Curran 33, Mousley 6) Seales keeps Curran honest with a sharp bouncer, well ducked, but the other five balls all go for singles. England are hanging in there. 37th over: England 172-5 (Curran 31, Mousley 3) A few singles off Motie. Carlos Brathwaite, on commentary, points out that Hope could do with Chase now as Mousley is a left-hander like Curran. 36th over: England 168-5 (Curran 29, Mousley 1) Hope brings back Seales, who set the tone at the top of the innings. He almost gets another wicket first ball as Curran sends a skyer to Carty, who can\u2019t cling on at deep extra. Mousley gets off the mark with a single, shovelled into the covers, and unfurls a broad smile. 35th over: England 165-5 (Curran 27, Mousley 0) The spinners have been excellent, but that was the first wicket either of them had taken. Motie now has 7-0-32-1 and out comes Dan Mousley, on his international debut, with a job to do. Just when he\u2019s taken charge of the game, England\u2019s new captain scoops the ball back to the bowler. At least it wasn\u2019t a skyer. 34th over: England 160-4 (Livingstone 44, Curran 26) Hope keeps Chase on for his final over, and Livingstone says thanks very much. He hits another six, whipped over long-on, and then whips again for four. And then he\u2019s dropped! At midwicket. It was low, but not so difficult. And that\u2019s drinks, with Livingstone now leading by example. He and Curran, two men for a crisis, have added 67. 33rd over: England 147-4 (Livingstone 33, Curran 24) Motie restores order with three dots and three singles. 32nd over: England 144-4 (Livingstone 32, Curran 22) Anything Curran can do, Livingstone can do bigger. He charges down the track and Chase, so economical up till now, finds himself launched for a great big six. That brings up the first fifty partnership of the day \u2013 51 off 11.1 overs. Is this a recovery we see before us? 31st over: England 137-4 (Livingstone 26, Curran 21) Shot! Sam Curran plays a lovely straight drive off Motie, pinpointing the gap behind the bowler and finding it with great precision. 30th over: England 130-4 (Livingstone 25, Curran 15) Chase, as usual, hands out only singles. If he was at home at Hallowe\u2019en, it would be strictly Mars Celebrations, no actual bars of chocolate \u2013 not that I can talk. And suddenly we\u2019ve reached the 30-over mark. Back in the day, teams were expected to double their score from here. If England manage that, they\u2019ll be doing well \u2013 but they\u2019ll only have the standard first-innings score at this ground, 260, which is never enough. 29th over: England 126-4 (Livingstone 23, Curran 13) Shai Hope, who has played his hand masterfully, brings back Motie. Livingstone responds by giving up on brute force and playing a delicate little lap for two. A caption reveals that England have now scored a century \u2013 of dot balls. 28th over: England 122-4 (Livingstone 20, Curran 12) Another over from Chase, another four singles. This is nice from Rob Knap. \u201cThe ideal time for watching overseas matches came up in a recent liveblog I think (can\u2019t remember if it was you manning the deck for that discussion or not!), but still... \u201c No it wasn\u2019t me \u2013 I just enjoyed reading it. \u201cI\u2019m pottering around with the cricket on in the background, the stresses of the day melting away a little, for now at least. Cricket matches have often felt like comfort blankets to me, and I think an ODI in the West Indies is just about the most reassuring of all: it\u2019s on after work, the skies are usually blue, there\u2019s an outcome by the end of the day, and compared to other formats the rhythms of the game just feel more relaxing. Or maybe it\u2019s the importance I give to the format: I don\u2019t mind so much how England do compared to watching them in Tests, whereas in T20s I don\u2019t care enough. \u201cHaving typed that out thoughtfully, Bethell gets out and I\u2019m annoyed and cursing at the TV! Ah well...\u201d 27th over: England 118-4 (Livingstone 18, Curran 10) Livingstone has some power in his arms and he uses it now to pull Joseph for four. That was pure village blacksmith. Seven off the over, which is riches by England\u2019s recent standards. Every member of their new-look top six has now reached double figures. Can somebody please make 30? 26th over: England 111-4 (Livingstone 12, Curran 9) Roston Chase doesn\u2019t have any wickets yet, but he\u2019s been taking them at the other end. His idea of a pricey over is going for four singles, as he does now. 25th over: England 107-4 (Livingstone 10, Curran 7) Forde, who has improved his figures to 7-0-36-2, gives way to Joseph. He keeps the pressure on by conceding only a single, and that\u2019s the halfway stage. The wicket is a bit sticky, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s as bad as England are making it look. Here\u2019s Tom van der Gucht. \u201cI liked Guy Hornsby\u2019s comment,\u201d he says, \u201cabout this being a T20 team playing 50 overs. With so many big hitting not-quite all-rounders, it almost feels like a Hong Kong Sixes team. They\u2019re just missing Ronnie Irani to round the team off and add some dibbly dobbler seam action.\u201d Good line. 24th over: England 106-4 (Livingstone 10, Curran 6) Curran, facing Chase, takes a kamikaze single and only gets away with it because the throw is too high. Another thrifty over for the Windies, two off it. 23rd over: England 104-4 (Livingstone 9, Curran 5) Forde, in this second spell, was threatening to turn into Seales. Livingstone tries to show him who\u2019s boss by muscling a cut through the ring, but it brings only two. Curran does better, gliding square for four. That\u2019s the first boundary for 55 balls. Old-school! 22nd over: England 97-4 (Livingstone 6, Curran 1) The bad news for Livingstone and Sam Curran is that they have a rebuilding job on their hands. The good news is that they both have plenty of time. Curran is often better at livening up the boring middle overs than he is at blasting at the death. 21st over: England 94-4 (Livingstone 4, Curran 0) Oh, England. Wherever they are in the world, whatever form of cricket they\u2019re playing, they always have a collapse in them. Just when Bethell was looking so good \u2026 he gets out to a skyer too! A short ball stops on him and his attempted pull loops to cover. 20th over: England 89-3 (Bethell 26, Livingstone 1) Liam Livingstone strides out for his first go at playing a captain\u2019s innings for England. Roston Chase whizzes through another tidy over. 19th over: England 86-3 (Bethell 24, Livingstone 0) That was a fine over from Matthew Forde \u2013 one wicket, only one run \u2013 and an inspired move from Shai Hope to bring him back. After looking so assured, Cox goes the same way as Salt and Jacks, caught off a skyer. Aiming for midwicket, he can only slice to third man, where Carty takes a cool calm catch. 18th over: England 85-2 (Cox 17, Bethell 23) Chase continues and keeps it tight \u2013 two dots, then two singles, then two more dots. It\u2019s a good battle. 17th over: England 83-2 (Cox 16, Bethell 22) Bethell, who may be just as confident as Cox, greets Motie\u2019s next over with a neat little ramp for two. They\u2019ve already put on 37 off 39 balls. Who needs experience? 16th over: England 79-2 (Cox 15, Bethell 19) It\u2019s spin at both ends as Roston Chase comes on with his offbreaks. He has a slip, so Hope reckons there\u2019s some turn. Cox and Bethell work the ball around for five singles as if they\u2019ve been doing this for years. 15th over: England 74-2 (Cox 13, Bethell 17) West Indies need to put the plug back in and Motie does the job, going for just two singles. And that\u2019s drinks, with honours about even: Jayden Seales pegged England back, but now Jacob Bethell is threatening to grab the wheel. An email comes in from Gary Naylor. \u201cThe dot,\u201d says the subject line, like the title of a novel. \u201cI\u2019m on the way back from Stratford Upon Avon (Othello - it didn\u2019t end well),\u201d Gary says. \u201cShakey\u2019s old stamping ground is tricky on trains, so I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here to help. I\u2019m still a bit tempted by Google Maps\u2019 crawling blue dot though, the only thing more depressing to watch than a one-sided ODI.\u201d Ha. 14th over: England 72-2 (Cox 12, Bethell 16) Jacob Bethell is on manoeuvres! Facing Joseph, he pulls for four, then does it again, with extra ferocity. And he adds a for four through the vacant slips. That\u2019s 13 off the over and for the first time today, an England batter is going at a run a ball (16 off 13). Bethell looks so at home in the Caribbean, it\u2019s almost as if he was born there. 13th over: England 59-2 (Cox 12, Bethell 3) Shai Hope decides it\u2019s time for some spin and brings on Gudakesh Motie with his slow left-arm. Cox, still exuding confidence, finds him straying onto leg stump and sweeps for four. 12th over: England 52-2 (Cox 7, Bethell 1) Seales is only human after all: he produces a village misfield at third man and a cut off Joseph turns into Cox\u2019s first ODI four. Bethell gets off the mark with a pull, meaty but mistimed. 11th over: England 46-2 (Cox 2, Bethell 0) To lose one opener to a skyer may be considered a misfortune. To lose two looks like carelessness, especially when Nos 3 and 4 have played only five ODIs between them. But credit to Jayden Seales: he\u2019s been immense. He lured Jacks, like Salt, into a mishit down the ground, which Gudakesh Motie did well to catch with the wind swirling around him. Seales has the sort of figures Sir Curtly used to collect: 5-1-8-2. One brings two! And again it\u2019s a skyer. 10th over: England 46-1 (Jacks 19, Cox 2) Joseph, so cool in the field just now, blots his copybook by giving away four leg-byes, but keeps it tight thereafter. The first Powerplay ends with West Indies the more satisfied of the two sides. 9th over: England 40-1 (Jacks 18, Cox 1) Seales is even better from the Curtly end at the Viv than he was from the Andy. It was his testing length that did for Salt, and it allows him to beat Jordan Cox too, outside off, as he flirts with a duck on ODI debut. Cox, who seems to have a superb temperament, isn\u2019t bothered: he dabs the next ball for a single. Seales was just changing ends. And it pays off as Salt skies a drive and Joseph, running back, takes a nonchalant catch. 8th over: England 39-0 (Salt 18, Jacks 18) The first bowler to be taken off is the immaculate Seales. Interesting. Alzarri Joseph replaces him and it doesn\u2019t go well. His first ball brings four overthrows as Lewis\u2019s sharp shy at the stumps surprises the fielders on the other side of the wicket. His second is a no-ball. His third, a free hit, goes better as Jacks can only inside-edge it for a single. Nine off the over, 17 off the past two. 7th over: England 30-0 (Salt 17, Jacks 11) Hope risks a fourth over from Forde. Salt retorts with a flash past gully for four, and then a better shot, a casual cuff past extra cover for four more. He\u2019s warming up. 6th over: England 22-0 (Salt 9, Jacks 11) Seales continues, bowling cross-seam. The lone slip has now slipped away. Another good over from Seales (3-0-7-0), yielding only a single to each batter. Mark Butcher reveals that, in the last five ODIs on this ground, the team batting first have made (on average) 261, and it\u2019s never been enough. Can England break that mould? 5th over: England 20-0 (Salt 8, Jacks 10) Most of the runs have come off Forde, but Hope still believes in him. He responds with a tighter over and nearly deceives Jacks with a slower ball, luring him into a loopy drive that lands just short of mid-off. If this was Test cricket, England would have 40 by now. 4th over: England 19-0 (Salt 8, Jacks 9) Seales continues and Salt again clips for two to midwicket, but he can\u2019t get after the other five balls. \u201cAs a Warwickshire follower,\u201d says Phil Russell, \u201cit\u2019s great to see Bethell and Mousley in the team, and hopefully Sam Hain will get more recognition before long too. Overall the line up does rather remind of the days of another Bears all-rounder, Dermot Reeve. Quite a lot of bits-and-pieces players for a 50 over game. A little concerned the batting will fizzle out and not go the distance.\u201d That would be very on-brand. 3rd over: England 17-0 (Salt 6, Jacks 9) Forde strays onto the pads, allowing Jacks to help himself to a cheap four. That gets Jacks going and when Forde goes wide of off, he launches into a fierce cover-drive, struck on the up. The trumpeter celebrates with a blast of Go West by the Village People \u2013 or, if you prefer, the Pet Shop Boys. 2nd over: England 8-0 (Salt 6, Jacks 1) The other end has a knighthood too: the Sir Andy Roberts End. Jayden Seales opens the bowling there and keeps Will Jacks quiet, restricting him to a leg glance. Salt adds a clip for two. \u201cEvening Tim,\u201d says Guy Hornsby, \u201ccricket is happening! This is quite the XI for England. It feels very like a T20 side needing to play 50 overs, though I guess many players don\u2019t really play the format any more. I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m mystified by Overton as a non-bowling all-rounder (I know he\u2019s injured). It was funky in T20s, but feels a luxury here, even through the Bazball lens. \u201cI know a few batters are home who must be wondering what they need to do. Penny for the excellent Sam Hain\u2019s thoughts... Still, come on England/cricket/West Indies!\u201d Sam Hain may have something else on his mind tonight. Many thanks to Steven Lynch of Wisden for pointing this out. 1st over: England 5-0 (Salt 4, Jacks 0) On a pitch like a biscuit, Forde makes a tidy start apart from one legside wide. Phil Salt plays himself in studiously for two balls, then bashes the third through the covers for four. \u201cSome quite long grass out there,\u201d says Mark Butcher. \u201cCould be taking the aerial route.\u201d Matthew Forde has the new ball and is ready to steam in from the Sir Curtly Ambrose end. Ends, like stands and indeed stadiums, sound better without the knighthood, don\u2019t they? The teams line up, accompanied by some mildly baffled schoolchildren. West Indies are in maroon with a yellow trim, England in sky blue with navy trousers. The anthems ring out, one rather more lustily than the other. If it was a singing contest, West Indies would have won. West Indies make only one change, bringing back Shimron Hetmyer. Like England, they were in action on the other side of the world just a few days ago (in Sri Lanka); unlike England, they were playing this form of the game. The broadcasters, TNT, have Phil Salt down as England\u2019s wicketkeeper, but there\u2019s been plenty of talk of Jordan Cox too, so I\u2019m going with a question mark or two. England 1 Phil Salt (wkt?), 2 Will Jacks, 3 Jordan Cox (wkt?), 4 Jacob Bethell, 5 Liam Livingstone (capt), 6 Sam Curran, 7 Dan Mousley, 8 Jamie Overton, 9 Jofra Archer, 10 Adil Rashid, 11 John Turner. West Indies 1 Evin Lewis, 2 Brandon King, 3 Keacy Carty, 4 Shai Hope (capt, wkt), 5 Sherfane Rutherford, 6 Shimron Hetmyer, 7 Roston Chase, 8 Gudakesh Motie, 9 Alzarri Joseph, 10 Matthew Forde, 11 Jayden Seales. \u201cWe would have bowled first as well,\u201d says Liam Livingstone. \u201cBut it looks a good pitch.\u201d Asked how he feels to be captain, he says \u201cincredibly proud\u201d. He reveals that his team includes four ODI debutants \u2013 Jordan Cox, Dan Mousley, Jamie Overton and John Turner. Shai Hope wins the toss and opts to bowl first, in case \u201cit gets a bit wet\u201d later on. Evening everyone. Another week, another continent, as The Only Ones so nearly sang. Five days after collapsing in a heap in Pakistan, England now have the chance to do it again in a different format in the Caribbean. I was going to say a shorter format, but that is now debatable. They will be hoping to stay in a bit longer than the 37 overs they managed the other day. As Brian Johnston used to observe, it\u2019s a funny game. It was less than a year ago that West Indies and England last met in an ODI at the Viv. We should really have a prize for anyone who can remember what happened. A glance at the scorecard shows that England won, with Liam Livingstone and Rehan Ahmed taking the wickets and Will Jacks, Harry Brook and Jos Buttler knocking off the runs. Buttler is now injured and Brook rested, but the others are in the squad and Livingstone is about to become England\u2019s sixth captain of the calendar year, which should at least stop him moaning about being too low in the order. England\u2019s line-up may well be a hotch-potch. The selectors seem to have reacted to the absence of the usual suspects by refusing to include any specialist batters. The top order could be a curious blend of wicketkeepers and slow-bowling all-rounders, although the attack makes up for any lack of experience with Jofra Archer, Reece Topley, Sam Curran and the great Adil Rashid. West Indies, by contrast, can field a settled side, captained by Shai Hope and starring the explosive Evin Lewis. Play starts at 6pm GMT, weather permitting \u2013 there\u2019s a bit of thunder in the air. See you just after 5.30 with news of the toss and (I hope) the teams.",

Peacock\u2019s dogged pursuit of the asbestos manufacturer James Hardie culminated in a court case brought by the asbestos disease victim <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/feb/27/james-hardie-asbestos-victims-to-get-extra-106m-in-support-from-nsw\">Bernie Banton.</a></p> <p>Over his 40-year broadcasting career Peacock was familiar to ABC audiences for his work as a foreign correspondent in London, Washington and New York, and as the chief political correspondent for current affairs radio in Canberra, among other roles.</p> <p>In 2017 he was one of the many staff to take voluntary redundancy due to ABC budget cuts. By then he was a senior reporter on 7.30 as well as the staff-elected director on the ABC board at the tumultuous time Michelle Guthrie was managing director.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t his first brush with redundancy. Despite his legendary career and his status as a board member, Peacock was placed into a redundancy \u201cpool\u201d alongside his colleagues on 7.30 to be assessed by management against a \u201cskills matrix\u201d in a process dubbed the Hunger Games.</p> <p>As the author of Killer Company: James Hardie Exposed, which details his role in uncovering the corruption and spin of the asbestos industry over three decades, Peacock had been in worse scrapes before and he survived.</p> <p>In 2015 he stood up for his colleagues when the ABC was under attack from News Corp after Zaky Mallah asked a question on Q&amp;A.</p> <p>Peacock said it was \u201can inflammatory campaign against the national public broadcaster directed by people who have a duty to show better leadership\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI urge staff to stand strong in the face of such intimidation and to maintain our statutory commitment to fearless, impartial and independent coverage.\u201d</p> <h2>Video mix-up</h2>    <p>On Saturday, as Israel launched its attacks on Iran, The Australian had a dramatic video of explosions auto-playing at the top of its website all day.

For comparison the New York Times report was headlined: \u201cTrump at the Garden: A Closing Carnival of Grievances, Misogyny and Racism\u201d NBC News: \u201cTrump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally overshadowed by his allies\u2019 crude and racist remarks.\u201d Giant mistake? Murdoch\u2019s Courier-Mail is excited that David Crisafulli has taken power in Queensland. Before the election the Courier urged a vote for Crisafulli in its editorial, saying Labor\u2019s \u201cbleeding-heart attitude to how the justice system should treat youth offenders\u201d had fuelled a crime crisis. The Liberal National party leader, on the other hand, was \u201ca driven career politician from central casting. His work ethic? Extraordinary.\u201d Just days into the new term, a documentary about the leader is set to launch. \u201cThe Courier-Mail has tracked David Crisafulli\u2019s ascension to power and spoken to those closest to him for a in-depth documentary that goes beneath the surface of Queensland\u2019s most powerful man,\u201d the teaser says. Sign up to get Guardian Australia\u2019s weekly media diary as a free newsletter The doco is called Goliath: The David Crisafulli story, in an apparent reference to the David and Goliath story in the Bible. Goliath was of course defeated by David, so we asked the Courier\u2019s editor, Chris Jones, if he had chosen the correct title \u2013 but we didn\u2019t hear back. Another Rundle comment emerges The former Crikey columnist Guy Rundle may have apologised in a statement on Arena this week for saying \u201cevery grope is now a sexual assault\u201d but another comment on the matter has popped up elsewhere. Rundle told editors at Arena that his text to Radio National Breakfast had been taken as expressing the idea that \u201cunwanted sexual touching\u201d was not sexual assault and was \u201cfalsely inflating\u201d the statistics. \u201cThis is not what I believe,\u201d he said. \u201cAll unwanted sexual touching is sexual assault.\u201d In October, Rundle posted a comment on the subject of the \u201cnew legal definition of assault\u201d on an article by another writer on Crikey. He said \u201cintimate relationship violence is defined as both physical and non physical, which then racks up huge numbers. \u201cThat presumably includes shouting, throwing stuff at the wall etc. The \u2018every two minutes\u2019 police call out stats are useless; police are called out to loud arguments now, and attend.\u201d The two minutes comment is a response to the article\u2019s estimate that, on average, \u201cpolice respond to a domestic and family violence incident every two minutes\u201d. Rundle did not respond to a request for comment. Victim of lockdown It\u2019s a brave journalist who reveals that his book did not sell but that is exactly what the Age\u2019s chief reporter, Chip Le Grand, said in an opinion piece about the Covid-19 response inquiry. \u201cTwo years ago, I wrote a book about Melbourne\u2019s pandemic experience,\u201d Le Grand wrote. \u201cFew people bought it and fewer still read it. \u201cI suspect that among the copies that were sold, many are sitting on bookshelves, crisply unopened, consigned to a history no one has much desire to revisit.\u201d Le Grand appears to have set aside his pride because he had an even bigger point to make: Australia hasn\u2019t learnt from the pandemic and was \u201cstill experiencing an acute case of COVID brain fog\u201d. A critic of Victoria\u2019s pandemic response, Le Grand believes the social harms inflicted by Covid and our public health response are \u201creal, serious and ongoing\u201d. Farewell to an ABC legend Matt Peacock, the former ABC journalist famous for exposing the dangers of asbestos over four decades, has died after a short battle with pancreatic cancer aged 72. His role in uncovering the asbestos scandal was made into a 2012 ABC telemovie, Devil\u2019s Dust, starring Ewan Leslie. Peacock\u2019s dogged pursuit of the asbestos manufacturer James Hardie culminated in a court case brought by the asbestos disease victim Bernie Banton. Over his 40-year broadcasting career Peacock was familiar to ABC audiences for his work as a foreign correspondent in London, Washington and New York, and as the chief political correspondent for current affairs radio in Canberra, among other roles. In 2017 he was one of the many staff to take voluntary redundancy due to ABC budget cuts. By then he was a senior reporter on 7.30 as well as the staff-elected director on the ABC board at the tumultuous time Michelle Guthrie was managing director. It wasn\u2019t his first brush with redundancy. Despite his legendary career and his status as a board member, Peacock was placed into a redundancy \u201cpool\u201d alongside his colleagues on 7.30 to be assessed by management against a \u201cskills matrix\u201d in a process dubbed the Hunger Games. As the author of Killer Company: James Hardie Exposed, which details his role in uncovering the corruption and spin of the asbestos industry over three decades, Peacock had been in worse scrapes before and he survived. In 2015 he stood up for his colleagues when the ABC was under attack from News Corp after Zaky Mallah asked a question on Q&amp;A. Peacock said it was \u201can inflammatory campaign against the national public broadcaster directed by people who have a duty to show better leadership\u201d. \u201cI urge staff to stand strong in the face of such intimidation and to maintain our statutory commitment to fearless, impartial and independent coverage.\u201d Video mix-up On Saturday, as Israel launched its attacks on Iran, The Australian had a dramatic video of explosions auto-playing at the top of its website all day. It was still on the homepage on Sunday morning. But the video was from the Lebanon strikes earlier in the month and not the Iran strikes. A screenshot of the Lebanon video also appeared on another article about Israel delivering retaliation against Iran. And a video on a third article had the same footage. After we contacted the editor-in-chief, Michelle Gunn, the video was removed and corrections were put on two pieces: \u201cAn earlier version of this story included an image of an explosion incorrectly captioned as purporting to be from Iran, when it was in fact a file image from Lebanon.\u201d Changing places There are so many roles at Aunty changing next year, you can expect a raft of announcements in coming weeks. On Friday morning Patricia Karvelas announced that the former foreign correspondent Sally Sara would replace her as host of Radio National Breakfast in 2025, and the program would have an earlier start time of 5.30am. Karvelas will take over as presenter of Afternoon Briefing each weekday on ABC iview and the ABC News channel. No one is confirming the next appointment but we tip the ACT newsreader James Glenday will be the replacement for the ABC News Breakfast host Michael Rowland, who we understand is likely to stand down from his early morning gig in coming months. Last month Rowland revealed he was looking for a \u201cless intense\u201d role. \u201cI\u2019m getting older \u2013 the ripe old age of 55 this year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe toll it takes gets more pronounced every year \u2013 the hours, the horrible stories we have to cover as journalists presenting a news program.\u201d After two years reading the news, Glenday, who has been standing in for Rowland while he is in the US covering the election, will transition to a more permanent role. He will be replaced by Greg Jennett, who is leaving the Afternoon Briefing chair.",

      "bodyText": "The cast of Marvel\u2019s Avengers movies have come out in support of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris less than a week before the US election. In a video posted first on Vanity Fair on Thursday evening, actors Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Don Cheadle, Chris Evans, Danai Gurira and Paul Bettany playfully riffed on their respective characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe while encouraging viewers to vote for Harris. The video, which runs for just over 90 seconds, opens with the actors taking an incoming video call from Johansson. On screen, they brainstorm ideas for a catchphrase for Harris, landing on the dubious \u201cDown with Democracy\u201d, which they spin into a brief Marvel-style Harris/Walz campaign video with dramatic music and comic-style graphics. The final frame of the video encourages viewers to vote on November 5. Sharing the video on X, Ruffalo, a vocal Democrat supporter who is best known for his role as the Hulk, wrote: \u201cDon\u2019t sit this one out. It\u2019s the one where we will lose big: Project 2025, women\u2019s reproductive rights, climate change, LGBTQIA+ rights, public education, student debt relief, Affordable Care Act, Social Security, and as of today, life saving vaccines. This shit is real and it\u2019s going to come for you.\u201d Speaking to Vanity Fair about the making of the video, Johansson, who played Black Widow in the Marvel films, said, \u201cIt just immediately turned into people trying to one-up each other with one-liners,\u201d and joked that Downey Jr and Ruffalo were \u201cbickering like two old ladies.

Completed just months ago, the airfield is the latest example of a push by the United States to build its presence in the Pacific as concerns around China\u2019s reach in the region grow. The small Pacific country is one of 12 in the world that has diplomatic ties with Taiwan instead of China and will head to the polls on 5 November, the same day as the US. Voters are mostly concerned about a weak economy and cost of living crisis. But outside Palau, the election symbolises the growing tussle for influence by Washington and Beijing playing out across the Pacific. The contest is an unlikely battle between brothers-in-law \u2013 President Surangel Whipps Jr will take on former president Tommy Esang Remengesau Jr. Whipps, a staunch pro-US candidate, wants to reform Palau\u2019s economy and strengthen security ties with Washington.

He served as CEO of the massive family company started by his father, Surangel &amp; Sons. Its logo \u2013 a smiley face wearing a crown \u2013 emblazons the country\u2019s only mall, the diggers that crisscross a massive quarry site near the national airport, the shirts of grocery store workers, a local bakery, a car rental company and countless other local businesses. Whipps no longer works for the company since becoming president in 2021. Over the past four years, Surangel &amp; Sons\u2019 construction arm has won at least 37 US defence contracts, valued at more than $5.8m. Whipps\u2019 rival for the presidency, Remengesau Jr, calls this a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d. \u201cThere seems to be no equal opportunities or opportunities for other companies to get the benefits of government projects or military projects,\u201d Remengesau said, adding that if he were elected president, he would look to break up the size of tendered projects so that smaller Palauan companies could compete for them. Whipps dismisses such criticisms as \u201csounding like a Chinese narrative\u201d. \u201cWe have never cheated, never taken advantage of any situation that we\u2019ve been in, from when we started our business 40 years ago, until now,\u201d the president told the Guardian. Remengesau served as president of Palau for 16 years, on-and-off between 2000 and 2020. Under his administration, Palau became known globally for several ambitious environmental policies \u2013 from creating the world\u2019s first shark sanctuary to converting 80% of Palau\u2019s waters into a marine sanctuary. Sitting at his home in the main town of Koror, while his young granddaughter leans against his shoulders and a small white kitten nips at his legs, Remengesau says he never intended to get back into politics. But a petition signed by more than 6,000 Palauans and delivered to him earlier this year convinced him otherwise. Remengesau doesn\u2019t oppose US military involvement in Palau but says it should not be a priority for Palau. He wants more consultation with traditional and community leaders to ensure the projects don\u2019t harm Palau\u2019s environment. \u201cChina and the US are trying to outdo each other with their defence and military strategies in the Pacific,\u201d Remengesau says. \u201cBut security for us is not about defence and militarisation.

The president says a 10% goods and services tax (PGST) introduced last year provides necessary revenue for the government, while Remengesau and his supporters have criticised the levy for worsening the financial burden on Palau\u2019s low-income households. \u201cThe problem with our economy is we have only one source of revenue, and that is the tourism industry,\u201d the country\u2019s only female senator, Rukebai Kikuo Inabo, says. \u201cChina was our main tourism market prior to Covid when we reached like 100,000 [visitors], but because of the Pacific politics, they have used tourism as an economic tool to try and change our foreign affairs.\u201d In 2017, the Chinese government ordered tour operators to stop selling packages to Palau in what many Palauans locals call \u201cthe China ban\u201d. More recently, shortly after Palau\u2019s government accused China of being behind a cyber-attack, Beijing issued a travel advisory for the Pacific country citing safety concerns. China\u2019s foreign ministry was contacted through regional embassies but did not respond. Tourism makes up an estimated 40% of Palau\u2019s GDP, and both presidential candidates have accused China of using economic pressure to influence its foreign and domestic policies. Whipps also believes the biggest opponents to the PGST are from businesses \u201caffiliated with a lot of Chinese [nationals]\u201d.

They are in the country for the week, drafting the plans behind a new hotel on the island, one of several owned by Chinese nationals. But not all Palauans see China\u2019s activity in the country as a bad thing. Newspaper publisher Moses Uludong, who recently dropped out of Palau\u2019s presidential race, struck a deal with Chinese businessmen in 2018 to create a new media group aimed at building ties between the two countries. The initiative never came to fruition, but Uludong is still keen for Palau to better benefit from China\u2019s lucrative market, saying it is wise for the country to \u201cmake friends with the biggest bully\u201d. \u201cHow come the Chinese can do business here and we can\u2019t do business there?\u201d Uludong tells the Guardian. \u201cWe want to promote Palau in China so tourists can come.\u201d While there\u2019s no indication Palau will shift its alliance away from the US and Taiwan following the election, Green says its leaders\u2019 ability to resist China\u2019s overtures depends on the strength of its governance. \u201cIt\u2019s more about how well governed the country [is] \u2026 and how accountable its leaders are,\u201d Green says. \u201c[Otherwise] leaders will do things for short-term political gains, with long-term consequences.\u201d Palau\u2019s alliance with Taiwan is popular among many of its voters. Taiwan provides the Pacific country a range of support \u2013 scholarships to study at Kainan University, visits from health staff to provide free medical checks to Palauns, and other modest agricultural and infrastructure projects. The former president is open to working more closely with China, as long as Palau can maintain its existing diplomatic relationships, especially with Taiwan. \u201cTo be honest, we would have relations with China and Taiwan if it was possible,\u201d Remengesau said. \u201cIf China wants to become our friends, yes, we\u2019ll accept them.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>Time for Tonali to take centre stage?</h2> <p>Dilemmas, dilemmas. Eddie Howe has a few in advance of Arsenal\u2019s visit to Tyneside on Saturday as Newcastle aim to correct a run of five league games without a win. Wednesday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/30/newcastle-chelsea-carabao-cup-match-report\">restorative Carabao Cup victory against Chelsea</a> has surely created competition for places, particularly at right-back where Emil Krafth\u2019s strong performance suggests he arguably should start in front of Tino Livramento. Significantly, with Bruno Guimar\u00e3es benched for most of the evening, Sandro Tonali shone at the heart of midfield. Is now the moment to leave the Italy international in the centre and relocate Guimar\u00e3es to Tonali\u2019s right or even start the Brazil midfielder on the bench again? Similarly Joe Willock impressed on the left of that department, pressing well and carrying the ball considerable distances. Can Newcastle\u2019s manager afford to drop Willock? Then there\u2019s Lloyd Kelly who did very well on a rare left-sided central defensive outing. Should Kelly get the nod ahead of Dan Burn? Dilemmas \u2026 <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Newcastle v Arsenal, Saturday 12.30pm</p></li> </ul> <h2>Iraola gets a City audition</h2> <p>While Pep Guardiola\u2019s future is still up in the air and with R\u00faben Amorim not under consideration, despite his Sporting sporting director Hugo Viana heading to City in the new year, many will be wondering who could step into the Catalan\u2019s shoes. Andoni Iraola will likely be on City\u2019s radar, as he shares a similar philosophy to the man in the visiting dugout on Saturday. Both are disciples of Marcelo Bielsa; Iraola played under the Argentinian successfully at Athletic Bilbao and has since shown many traits picked up from his former manager in Bournemouth\u2019s high-energy play. Guardiola looks increasingly likely to stay for a further season but Iraola is a patient man, knowing he still has plenty to learn after six full seasons of management. What will help his chances is the ability to go toe-to-toe against City to give the club\u2019s hierarchy a first-hand idea of what they could expect if Iraola were ever to be appointed. <strong>Will Unwin</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Bournemouth v Manchester City, 3pm Saturday</p></li> </ul> <h2>Competition for places hotting up at Anfield</h2> <p>Arne Slot says he is worried about his striking options but the violins are not playing yet for a head coach who still has Mohamed Salah, Luis D\u00edaz, Cody Gakpo and Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez at his disposal, 12 wins in 14 matches at Liverpool and a place in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/30/brighton-liverpool-carabao-cup-match-report\">Wednesday\u2019s win at Brighton</a>. Gakpo produced two finishes of the highest quality at the Amex Stadium, where Slot started with an innovative front two of Curtis Jones and Dominik Szoboszlai. That pairing is unlikely to be repeated when the teams meet again at Anfield but it will be intriguing to see whether Gakpo retains his place on the left. The competition between the Netherlands international and an in-form D\u00edaz is growing, although the former has been handed only two starts in the league this season. Both had a telling impact at Brighton and Gakpo\u2019s versatility also ensures Slot\u2019s options remain the envy of most. <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Liverpool v Brighton, Saturday 3pm</p></li> </ul>    <h2>A pivotal clash at Portman Road</h2> <p>The meeting between Ipswich and Leicester on Saturday afternoon feels like a tone-setter for the season. Last weekend\u2019s defeats were gut punches: Ipswich\u2019s surrendering of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/26/brentford-ipswich-premier-league-match-report\">2-0 lead at Brentford</a> leaves them winless after nine games, while for Leicester, two wins and five points better off than their opponents, the comprehensive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/25/leicester-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report\">3-1 home defeat against Forest</a> was a reminder that this is likely to be a long challenging season. The Championship\u2019s top two last season drew 1-1 in both fixtures in 2023-24, though that does not quite tell the full story. It took an injury-time Sam Morsy equaliser to rescue Ipswich on Boxing Day at Portman Road, and less than a month later Jeremy Sarmiento struck with an 89th-minute equaliser to do likewise at the King Power. Defeat for either side in this one would be tough to take. <strong>John Ashdown</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Ipswich v Leicester, Saturday 3pm</p></li> </ul> <h2>Southampton\u2019s search goes on</h2> <p>Southampton are in desperate need of a win. Russell Martin\u2019s side are slowly on their way to keeping company with <em>that</em> Derby team, a sight no fan wants to see. They may be buoyant going into this weekend against Everton, given the visitors are historically weak at St Mary\u2019s and having secured their spot in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals. But they let a 2-0 lead slip against Stoke, after persisting with Martin\u2019s possession-based attacking style, and the manager has made it clear he is unwilling to compromise. \u201cFor us, the challenge and the learning is about trying to remain who we want to be and trying to improve and be better at that and grow under the big spotlight and scrutiny. Then the rest will take care of itself and I\u2019ll be fine and comfortable with whatever happens.\u201d All well and good to say, but they sit bottom with one point from nine games. Everton\u2019s pragmatic, gritty approach over the past couple of seasons has shown that they are willing to survive ugly. Is it time for the Saints to do the same? <strong>Yara El-Shaboury</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Southampton v Everton, Saturday 3pm</p></li> </ul>    <h2>Will Gibbs-White return for Forest?</h2> <p>Morgan Gibbs-White has not played for almost a month through injury. The midfielder has been Nottingham Forest\u2019s standout player since joining the club in 2022 and many feared his absence would be a huge problem. Contrary to those worries, Forest have been in fine form, winning the two matches without Gibbs-White. Elliot Anderson has stepped into the void and impressed further up the pitch behind Chris Wood. If Gibbs-White is eventually declared fit, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo will have to decide whether he should immediately return the England international to the starting XI or put faith in the players that defeated Crystal Palace and Leicester. It is an indication of the strength in depth Forest accrued over the summer that the manager has various options of how to set up the team and which personnel to use. If Forest are to maintain their top-half position, they will need everyone and there is no shortage of quality to help the push. <strong>WU</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Nottingham Forest v West Ham, Saturday 3pm</p></li> </ul> <h2>Wolves look to begin turnaround</h2> <p>Wolves remain one of three winless teams but head into the home game against Crystal Palace with a spring in their step after a late fightback salvaged a point at Brighton. Gary O\u2019Neil will hope that draw proves a turning point and he has stayed upbeat despite a demoralising start. Even a fortnight ago, when they had a sole point from seven games, he painted a more positive picture than most, inventing a word along the way. \u201cIt\u2019s easily turnaround-able,\u201d the Wolves head coach said. Now his team have two points from nine matches. \u201cWhen we do turn it around, which we will, it will be a real nice feeling that we know we had to dig deep, having gone through a tough moment and come out at the other end.\u201d Defeat by Palace would surely pierce such optimism. <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Wolves v Crystal Palace, Saturday 5.30pm</p></li> </ul>    <h2>Werner hopes to kick on</h2> <p>Timo Werner\u2019s renewed confidence might be the spark Tottenham need as they prepare to face an in-form Aston Villa. The German scored his first goal of the season in Wednesday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/30/tottenham-manchester-city-carabao-cup-match-report\">Carabao Cup win over Manchester City</a>, underscoring his commitment to his instinctive, aggressive runs. The striker\u2019s scoring has been marred by recent struggles, but Werner seems determined to kick on. \u201cOf course when you are a striker and don\u2019t score, you think too much in front of the goal but I never think about not doing the runs to come into this situation. I think it would be stupid to stop those runs only because being scared to score.\u201d Spurs high-risk, front-foot style has at times left their defence exposed. Ange Postecoglou\u2019s side have lost nine of their last 16 league games, with only Wolves losing more since but if Werner can channel his newfound confidence, their chances look slightly more promising against Villa\u2019s clinical attack. <strong>YE-S</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Tottenham v Aston Villa, Sunday 2pm</p></li> </ul> <h2>Ugarte to stake his claim</h2> <p>The early stages of Manuel Ugarte\u2019s Manchester United career have been somewhat of a struggle. It is not his fault he was welcomed in the dying embers of Erik ten Hag\u2019s reign when neither performances nor results were good enough. At 23, the Uruguayan could be at the heart of the midfield for years to come, so onlookers should accept this is all part of the learning curve. In Wednesday night\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/30/manchester-united-leicester-carabao-cup-match-report\">Carabao Cup victory over Leicester</a>, Ugarte put in his best performance thus far, providing plenty of energy and bite. It was the morale-boosting game Ugarte required but he knows Sunday will be a tougher test, against Chelsea and Cole Palmer. He has an advantage over his teammates as he knows what R\u00faben Amorim wants from his players, having spent time with him at Sporting and will be desperate to be a key individual under the new manager by showing what he can do. <strong>WU</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Manchester United v Chelsea, Sunday 4.30pm</p></li> </ul> <h2>Bees hope to finally hold on away from home</h2> <p>Brentford\u2019s past three away games have all ended in narrow defeat after impressive starts. Thomas Frank\u2019s side led against Tottenham, Manchester City and Manchester United but were unable to hold out when their opponents stirred. Still, perhaps that had something to do with the standard of the opposition, and the level will not be quite as high at Fulham on Monday. Frank will hope his team can defend with more organisation if they go ahead against their west London rivals. That said, Brentford have not picked up a point on the road this season and they will not underestimate Fulham, a highly entertaining team with a fine record at home. <strong>Jacob

      "bodyText": "Time for Tonali to take centre stage? Dilemmas, dilemmas. Eddie Howe has a few in advance of Arsenal\u2019s visit to Tyneside on Saturday as Newcastle aim to correct a run of five league games without a win. Wednesday\u2019s restorative Carabao Cup victory against Chelsea has surely created competition for places, particularly at right-back where Emil Krafth\u2019s strong performance suggests he arguably should start in front of Tino Livramento. Significantly, with Bruno Guimar\u00e3es benched for most of the evening, Sandro Tonali shone at the heart of midfield. Is now the moment to leave the Italy international in the centre and relocate Guimar\u00e3es to Tonali\u2019s right or even start the Brazil midfielder on the bench again? Similarly Joe Willock impressed on the left of that department, pressing well and carrying the ball considerable distances. Can Newcastle\u2019s manager afford to drop Willock? Then there\u2019s Lloyd Kelly who did very well on a rare left-sided central defensive outing. Should Kelly get the nod ahead of Dan Burn? Dilemmas \u2026 Louise Taylor Newcastle v Arsenal, Saturday 12.30pm Iraola gets a City audition While Pep Guardiola\u2019s future is still up in the air and with R\u00faben Amorim not under consideration, despite his Sporting sporting director Hugo Viana heading to City in the new year, many will be wondering who could step into the Catalan\u2019s shoes. Andoni Iraola will likely be on City\u2019s radar, as he shares a similar philosophy to the man in the visiting dugout on Saturday. Both are disciples of Marcelo Bielsa; Iraola played under the Argentinian successfully at Athletic Bilbao and has since shown many traits picked up from his former manager in Bournemouth\u2019s high-energy play. Guardiola looks increasingly likely to stay for a further season but Iraola is a patient man, knowing he still has plenty to learn after six full seasons of management. What will help his chances is the ability to go toe-to-toe against City to give the club\u2019s hierarchy a first-hand idea of what they could expect if Iraola were ever to be appointed. Will Unwin Bournemouth v Manchester City, 3pm Saturday Competition for places hotting up at Anfield Arne Slot says he is worried about his striking options but the violins are not playing yet for a head coach who still has Mohamed Salah, Luis D\u00edaz, Cody Gakpo and Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez at his disposal, 12 wins in 14 matches at Liverpool and a place in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals courtesy of Wednesday\u2019s win at Brighton. Gakpo produced two finishes of the highest quality at the Amex Stadium, where Slot started with an innovative front two of Curtis Jones and Dominik Szoboszlai. That pairing is unlikely to be repeated when the teams meet again at Anfield but it will be intriguing to see whether Gakpo retains his place on the left. The competition between the Netherlands international and an in-form D\u00edaz is growing, although the former has been handed only two starts in the league this season. Both had a telling impact at Brighton and Gakpo\u2019s versatility also ensures Slot\u2019s options remain the envy of most. Andy Hunter Liverpool v Brighton, Saturday 3pm A pivotal clash at Portman Road The meeting between Ipswich and Leicester on Saturday afternoon feels like a tone-setter for the season. Last weekend\u2019s defeats were gut punches: Ipswich\u2019s surrendering of a 2-0 lead at Brentford leaves them winless after nine games, while for Leicester, two wins and five points better off than their opponents, the comprehensive 3-1 home defeat against Forest was a reminder that this is likely to be a long challenging season. The Championship\u2019s top two last season drew 1-1 in both fixtures in 2023-24, though that does not quite tell the full story. It took an injury-time Sam Morsy equaliser to rescue Ipswich on Boxing Day at Portman Road, and less than a month later Jeremy Sarmiento struck with an 89th-minute equaliser to do likewise at the King Power. Defeat for either side in this one would be tough to take. John Ashdown Ipswich v Leicester, Saturday 3pm Southampton\u2019s search goes on Southampton are in desperate need of a win. Russell Martin\u2019s side are slowly on their way to keeping company with that Derby team, a sight no fan wants to see. They may be buoyant going into this weekend against Everton, given the visitors are historically weak at St Mary\u2019s and having secured their spot in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals. But they let a 2-0 lead slip against Stoke, after persisting with Martin\u2019s possession-based attacking style, and the manager has made it clear he is unwilling to compromise. \u201cFor us, the challenge and the learning is about trying to remain who we want to be and trying to improve and be better at that and grow under the big spotlight and scrutiny. Then the rest will take care of itself and I\u2019ll be fine and comfortable with whatever happens.\u201d All well and good to say, but they sit bottom with one point from nine games. Everton\u2019s pragmatic, gritty approach over the past couple of seasons has shown that they are willing to survive ugly. Is it time for the Saints to do the same? Yara El-Shaboury Southampton v Everton, Saturday 3pm Will Gibbs-White return for Forest? Morgan Gibbs-White has not played for almost a month through injury. The midfielder has been Nottingham Forest\u2019s standout player since joining the club in 2022 and many feared his absence would be a huge problem. Contrary to those worries, Forest have been in fine form, winning the two matches without Gibbs-White. Elliot Anderson has stepped into the void and impressed further up the pitch behind Chris Wood. If Gibbs-White is eventually declared fit, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo will have to decide whether he should immediately return the England international to the starting XI or put faith in the players that defeated Crystal Palace and Leicester. It is an indication of the strength in depth Forest accrued over the summer that the manager has various options of how to set up the team and which personnel to use. If Forest are to maintain their top-half position, they will need everyone and there is no shortage of quality to help the push. WU Nottingham Forest v West Ham, Saturday 3pm Wolves look to begin turnaround Wolves remain one of three winless teams but head into the home game against Crystal Palace with a spring in their step after a late fightback salvaged a point at Brighton. Gary O\u2019Neil will hope that draw proves a turning point and he has stayed upbeat despite a demoralising start. Even a fortnight ago, when they had a sole point from seven games, he painted a more positive picture than most, inventing a word along the way. \u201cIt\u2019s easily turnaround-able,\u201d the Wolves head coach said. Now his team have two points from nine matches. \u201cWhen we do turn it around, which we will, it will be a real nice feeling that we know we had to dig deep, having gone through a tough moment and come out at the other end.\u201d Defeat by Palace would surely pierce such optimism. Ben Fisher Wolves v Crystal Palace, Saturday 5.30pm Werner hopes to kick on Timo Werner\u2019s renewed confidence might be the spark Tottenham need as they prepare to face an in-form Aston Villa. The German scored his first goal of the season in Wednesday\u2019s Carabao Cup win over Manchester City, underscoring his commitment to his instinctive, aggressive runs. The striker\u2019s scoring has been marred by recent struggles, but Werner seems determined to kick on. \u201cOf course when you are a striker and don\u2019t score, you think too much in front of the goal but I never think about not doing the runs to come into this situation. I think it would be stupid to stop those runs only because being scared to score.\u201d Spurs high-risk, front-foot style has at times left their defence exposed. Ange Postecoglou\u2019s side have lost nine of their last 16 league games, with only Wolves losing more since but if Werner can channel his newfound confidence, their chances look slightly more promising against Villa\u2019s clinical attack. YE-S Tottenham v Aston Villa, Sunday 2pm Ugarte to stake his claim The early stages of Manuel Ugarte\u2019s Manchester United career have been somewhat of a struggle. It is not his fault he was welcomed in the dying embers of Erik ten Hag\u2019s reign when neither performances nor results were good enough. At 23, the Uruguayan could be at the heart of the midfield for years to come, so onlookers should accept this is all part of the learning curve. In Wednesday night\u2019s Carabao Cup victory over Leicester, Ugarte put in his best performance thus far, providing plenty of energy and bite. It was the morale-boosting game Ugarte required but he knows Sunday will be a tougher test, against Chelsea and Cole Palmer. He has an advantage over his teammates as he knows what R\u00faben Amorim wants from his players, having spent time with him at Sporting and will be desperate to be a key individual under the new manager by showing what he can do. WU Manchester United v Chelsea, Sunday 4.30pm Bees hope to finally hold on away from home Brentford\u2019s past three away games have all ended in narrow defeat after impressive starts. Thomas Frank\u2019s side led against Tottenham, Manchester City and Manchester United but were unable to hold out when their opponents stirred. Still, perhaps that had something to do with the standard of the opposition, and the level will not be quite as high at Fulham on Monday. Frank will hope his team can defend with more organisation if they go ahead against their west London rivals. That said, Brentford have not picked up a point on the road this season and they will not underestimate Fulham, a highly entertaining team with a fine record at home.
