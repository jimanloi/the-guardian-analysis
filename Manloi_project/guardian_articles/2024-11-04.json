In fact, since the emergence of Donald Trump as a presidential force, it can sometimes feel as though US politics gets as much media coverage in Australia as our own leaders. This means the 2024 election is easy to follow, with live TV and rolling online news coverage. There will also be in-person election watch parties across Australia. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the election if you\u2019re in Australia. When is the US election in Australian time? The presidential election will be held on Tuesday 5 November in the US, which means most of the action will occur on Wednesday 6 November in Australia. What time and date will it be in Australia when polls close? Polls begin to close in eastern states from 6pm US Eastern Time on Tuesday, 5 November. In Australia, this will be on Wednesday \u2013 from 10am Australian Eastern Daylight Time, 9am in Queensland, 9.30am in South Australia and 7am in Western Australia. By 8pm US ET, polls will have fully closed in more than 20 states, including the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania. In Australia it will be Wednesday noon AEDT, 11am in Queensland, 11.30am in SA and 9am in WA. Polls will close in Michigan and Wisconsin \u2013 two other crucial states \u2013 by 9pm US ET, which in Australia will be Wednesday 1pm AEDT, 12pm in Queensland, 12.30pm in SA and 10am in WA. Hawaii and Alaska, the western-most states, will close their polls at 12am US ET, which in Australia will be Wednesday 4pm AEDT, 3pm in Queensland, 3.30pm in SA and 1pm in WA. When will the election results be announced? We should have a good sense of who will probably be president by the time polls close in Hawaii and Alaska, which is several hours after vote counting in some key eastern states will have begun. The world may have to wait a bit longer to hear a final call, especially given how tightly contested some polling has indicated the vote will be. In 2020 the Associated Press did not declare Joe Biden as the winner of the presidential election until 7 November at 11.26am US ET \u2013 four days after the first polls closed. And in 2016 it took until 2.29am US ET the morning after election day to declare Trump the winner. If a winner is to be declared in a similar timeframe to 2016, that would fall around Wednesday evening in Australia, about 7PM AEDT, 6pm in Queensland, 6.30pm in SA and 4pm in WA. What TV channels in Australia will have live coverage? All free-to-air TV stations will have rolling coverage. The ABC, Channel 10, Nine and SBS\u2019s coverage all begins at or shortly after 10am AEDT on Wednesday. Channel Seven\u2019s coverage will begin at 11.30am. The SBS broadcast will include coverage from the US outlet PBS. Coverage will continue throughout the day, with Australian channels breaking for local news bulletins and evening programs at different points. What about online news coverage? The Guardian has you sorted, with our extensive bureaux across the US as well as newsrooms around the world. We will be running a live blog covering the election throughout the day, in addition to our continued extensive US election coverage, which will include a live results tracker. Where are US election watch parties being held in my city? Adelaide The University of Adelaide\u2019s Politics and International Relations Association will be holding its party at the Crown and Sceptre hotel from 11am (local time) on Wednesday. Brisbane Democrats Abroad, an official arm of the Democratic party, is holding its party at the Pig \u2018N\u2019 Whistle from 10am on Wednesday. Canberra Democrats Abroad is holding its party at PJ\u2019s in the City from 10am on Wednesday 6 November. Melbourne AmCham, the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia, is holding a watch party at Hawthorn hotel from 2pm on Wednesday. The party will feature a live broadcast of NBC\u2019s election coverage. This is a paid, ticketed event. Democrats Abroad is holding its party at Belgrave hotel from 10am on Wednesday.

This time, if Trump is elected, it will be much harder: there is no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/12/mike-pence-donald-trump-was-wrong-history-will-hold-him-accountable\">Mike Pence</a>, and the respected senior military personnel central to Trump\u2019s first administration, notably <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/06/james-mattis-denounces-trump-protests-militarization/612640/\">James Mattis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/john-kelly-trump-fitness-character.html\">John Kelly</a>, with whom Australia had solid foundations, are now among Trump\u2019s most ardent critics.

Such established contacts could become far more tenuous.</p> \n<p>Now in Washington, there is, in the words of the person above with such insight, a \u201cvery panicky [Australian] shaking of the tree\u2019\u2019 for even the most distant contact with Trump\u2019s people.</p> \n<p>Trump, as he has repeatedly let it be known, has a long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/nov/03/if-trump-wins-the-election-these-11-issues-will-be-under-threat\">list of enemies</a>.

      "bodyText": "For many months the federal government has been calming the farm, officials urging us to \u201cjust chill\u201d about the possibility of our major ally the United States returning to the control of a misogynist, dictatorially inclined, sexually abusing convicted felon who reportedly said he\u2019d execute political enemies and turn the military on fellow Americans. And that\u2019s all just for starters. There\u2019s a whole lot more to not chill about. So I won\u2019t be chilling about the most consequential election of my lifetime. Because it is clear that behind the \u201cwe\u2019ll work with whoever is elected/it won\u2019t alter the US-Australia relationship\u201d facade, there is a level of Australian diplomatic, military and bureaucratic anxiety bordering on panic about the 50/50 prospect of a second Trump presidency. Have no doubt that a Trump 2.0 prospect is viewed by the federal government as the embodiment of (in the words of one familiar with the behind-the-scenes war-gaming) \u201cutter chaos\u201d for Australia. The starting point, of course, no matter what is said publicly, is that the centre-left Albanese government is hoping and praying for the election of Kamala Harris. Meanwhile, all its efforts are being invested in trying to build bridges with a possible Trump administration. After Trump\u2019s unanticipated election in 2016, a \u201cTeam Australia\u2019\u2019 diplomatic effort was swiftly launched to build bridges with Trump after eight years of Democrat Barack Obama through well-established Republican party, military, diplomatic and bureaucratic channels. This time, if Trump is elected, it will be much harder: there is no Mike Pence, and the respected senior military personnel central to Trump\u2019s first administration, notably James Mattis and John Kelly, with whom Australia had solid foundations, are now among Trump\u2019s most ardent critics. The American federal bureaucracy is, at the senior levels where meaningful informal country-to-country relations exist between the US and Australia, under the shadow of Project 2025 which would politicise the public service to enable Trump. Such established contacts could become far more tenuous. Now in Washington, there is, in the words of the person above with such insight, a \u201cvery panicky [Australian] shaking of the tree\u2019\u2019 for even the most distant contact with Trump\u2019s people. Trump, as he has repeatedly let it be known, has a long list of enemies. While it doesn\u2019t necessarily take much to get on this Olympic narcissist\u2019s personal injury list, his enablers in the media have helped somewhat \u2013 especially in the case of Australia\u2019s ambassador to the US, former prime minister Kevin Rudd. In beltway Washington \u2013 in the policy thinktanks, among military scholars, at senior levels of the bureaucracy and in the state department \u2013 Rudd is, quite rightly, a respected thinker, not least regarding China. But that\u2019s not anti-Washington Trump. And right now just about everyone from across the Australian political divide (including previous Australian Washington ambassadors, business and cultural figures and senior diplomats from other countries) who might help Rudd build bridges to Trump is currently doing so. Despite the tireless efforts of Rudd and others, and for all their generous words about Trump (former ambassador Joe Hockey, who now runs a Washington consultancy, insisted on the weekend Trump 2.0 would be different to Trump 1.0 and thus \u201cgood for us\u2019\u2019 offering \u201csome measure of predictability, whereas Harris will be a little less predictable because she needs to differentiate herself from the Biden presidency\u201d \u2013 seriously!), Rudd would appear to be prominent on that enemies list. Trump himself made this clear about \u201cnasty\u2019\u2019 Rudd back in March, Rudd having (correctly) deemed Trump \u201cnuts\u2019\u2019 and a \u201ctraitor to the west\u2019\u2019. The efforts to build bridges with Trump, or at least between Trump and Rudd, appear quite fruitless. Don\u2019t listen to me. Take the word of Lara Trump, his daughter-in-law and co-chair of the Republican National Committee who said last week of Rudd: \u201cIt\u2019s not my decision, but I do think it would be nice to have a person who appreciates all that Donald Trump has gone through to want to serve our country at this moment ... and maybe we want to choose somebody else.\u2019\u2019 The mere suggestion that Trump would (if even he could \u201cchoose\u2019\u2019 our country\u2019s ambassador to Washington) determine Rudd\u2019s ambassadorial tenure, raises serious questions of sovereignty for Australia. The Albanese government would probably do very well to back Rudd to the hilt in the globally unfortunate, perhaps geopolitically disastrous, event of a second Trump presidency. What happens, we must also wonder, if the felonious Trump 2.0 wanted to visit Australia? Australia, after all, can refuse or cancel the visa of a would-be visitor if they fail the character test \u2013 a bar that may not be nearly low enough for Trump to hurdle. Albanese, instructively, has declined to publicly contemplate this. Remember, too, that Albanese has, rightly, been critical of Trump, saying as opposition leader that, having lost the 2020 election, Trump encouraged the violent 6 January 2021 insurgency \u2013 an \u201cassault on the rule of law and democracy\u2019\u2019. In 2016 then shadow foreign affairs minister Penny Wong judiciously said a recently elected Trump should force a reassessment of the Australia-US relationship. Would this be enough to earn them places on Trump\u2019s vengeful list? Regardless, the Albanese government would be on an immediate collision course with a re-elected Trump over global climate policy, the former president reportedly having vowed to again quickly withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord. This would naturally embolden climate change sceptics globally, not least among Australia\u2019s elected conservatives. The policy, electoral and leadership implications here, where the politics of climate change and emissions targets resembles a bloodsport, could be profound.

The typical concentration of fluoride in regular toothpaste is between 1,000 and 1,500 parts per million.</p> <h2>How long has fluoride been added to drinking water? </h2>  <p>In the early 1900s, dentists noticed that rates of tooth decay were lower in areas where people had splotchy staining on their teeth \u2013 a condition caused by excess fluoride and now known as dental fluorosis. They realised that areas with naturally higher fluoride levels in water had lower rates of dental decay.</p> <p>In 1945, Grand Rapids, Michigan, became the first place in the world to add fluoride to its drinking water. Fluoridation in the US is not mandatory and occurs on a voluntary basis, but by 2012, more than 67% of the overall US population had access to fluoridated tap water.</p> <p>In 2011, the US Health and Human Services Department <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-lowers-limits-for-fluoride-in-water-idUSTRE7064CM/\">lowered its recommended level</a> of fluoride in drinking water to 0.7mg of fluoride per litre \u2013 0.7 parts per million. For five decades before that, the upper limit was 1.2.</p> <h2>Does fluoride in water have any health effects? Is it safe? </h2>  <p>A number of international health agencies have endorsed fluoride in drinking water as effective and safe. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention named fluoridation one of the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056796.htm\">10 great public health interventions of the 20th century</a>.</p> <p>Contrary to Kennedy\u2019s claims, studies have found no evidence linking fluoride in regular drinking water to conditions such as osteoporosis, bone fractures or cancer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/25/nobel-prize-winners-endorse-kamala-harris\">Nobel prize winners endorse Harris and warn Trump would endanger future of science</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As with any chemical compound, ingestion of fluoride at high levels can have adverse effects, such as skeletal fluorosis, a condition in which fluoride is incorporated into the bones, and dental fluorosis. These only occur with chronic exposure to fluoride at far higher levels than the safe drinking limits.</p> <p>\u201cEverything is a poison at high enough levels \u2013 even water,\u201d Jones said.</p> <p>In August, the US\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/aug/23/fluoride-water-study\">National Toxicology Program</a> released a review suggesting a link between fluoride exposure above 1.5mg of fluoride per litre of water and lower IQ in children. However, experts have pointed out that there is a lack of high quality research on the topic.</p> <p>\u201cSome studies \u2026 were considered as having a high risk of bias in other systematic reviews,\u201d Do said. <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00220345221119431\">Do\u2019s own research</a> has found no association between drinking fluoridated water before age five and changes in behavioural development or executive functioning.</p> <h2>What countries add fluoride to water? </h2>  <p>Dozens of countries artificially fluoridate drinking water. As of 2012, about 435 million people globally have access to water with fluoride at recommended levels.</p> <p>The US, UK, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Brazil are among the countries that add fluoride to water in at least some regions.</p> <p>Do said adding fluoride to water was a good method to reduce socioeconomic inequality in dental health. \u201cIt\u2019s a passive way to reduce dental caries.\u201d</p> <h2>What could change if Donald Trump wins the US election?</h2>  <p>Kennedy, who Donald Trump has promised to put in charge of health initiatives, said on Saturday that the Republican would push to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected president.</p> <p>Kennedy has emerged as one of Trump\u2019s top surrogates after dropping out as independent candidate. On Sunday, Trump told NBC News that he and Kennedy had not spoken about fluoride, but that the plan \u201csounds OK to me\u201d.</p> <h2>Where has fluoride been removed from water in the past and what was the effect?</h2>  <p>Authorities in several jurisdictions have removed fluoride from drinking water by public mandate, such as in&nbsp;Calgary, Canada in 2011, or by ministerial decree, such as in Israel in 2014.</p> <p>Research shows that <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28404475/\">dental cavities in children</a> increased in Calgary after the end of fluoridation, while the rates of dental treatment <a href=\"https://ijhpr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13584-022-00514-z\">significantly increased in Israel</a>. Calgary is set to re-introduce fluoridation in 2025.</p> <p>Germany stopped fluoridating its water in the 1970s and never reintroduced it, but since 1991 has <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16156167/\">sold salt with added fluoride</a>.</p>  <p><strong>Read more of the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2024\">2024 US election coverage</a>:</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/05/us-election-2024-live-updates-donald-trump-vs-kamala-harris-results-presidential-elections-day-latest-news-polls-update\">US election 2024 live updates: latest polls, results and news</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/when-do-polls-close-election-day\">When do polls close</a>?</p></li> <li><p>How the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/election-electoral-college-votes-explained\">electoral college works</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/26/election-abortion-ballot-measures-states\">Where is abortion on the ballot?</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/18/senate-races-elections-to-watch\">Senate</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/11/house-races-2024-elections-explainer\">House</a> races to watch</p></li> <li><p>Lessons from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/26/swing-state-polls-pennsylvania-michigan-georgia-arizona-wisconsin-nevada-north-carolina\">key swing states</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/03/election-trump-harris-policies-issues\">Trump v Harris on key issues</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/nov/03/if-trump-wins-the-election-these-11-issues-will-be-under-threat\">What\u2019s at stake</a> in this election</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/nov/03/us-presidential-election-trump-harris\">What to know about the US election</a></p></li> </ul>",

The World Health Organization\u2019s safe limit for fluoride in drinking water is 1.5mg of fluoride per litre of water \u2013 or 1.5 parts per million. The typical concentration of fluoride in regular toothpaste is between 1,000 and 1,500 parts per million. How long has fluoride been added to drinking water? In the early 1900s, dentists noticed that rates of tooth decay were lower in areas where people had splotchy staining on their teeth \u2013 a condition caused by excess fluoride and now known as dental fluorosis. They realised that areas with naturally higher fluoride levels in water had lower rates of dental decay. In 1945, Grand Rapids, Michigan, became the first place in the world to add fluoride to its drinking water. Fluoridation in the US is not mandatory and occurs on a voluntary basis, but by 2012, more than 67% of the overall US population had access to fluoridated tap water. In 2011, the US Health and Human Services Department lowered its recommended level of fluoride in drinking water to 0.7mg of fluoride per litre \u2013 0.7 parts per million. For five decades before that, the upper limit was 1.2. Does fluoride in water have any health effects? Is it safe? A number of international health agencies have endorsed fluoride in drinking water as effective and safe. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention named fluoridation one of the 10 great public health interventions of the 20th century. Contrary to Kennedy\u2019s claims, studies have found no evidence linking fluoride in regular drinking water to conditions such as osteoporosis, bone fractures or cancer. As with any chemical compound, ingestion of fluoride at high levels can have adverse effects, such as skeletal fluorosis, a condition in which fluoride is incorporated into the bones, and dental fluorosis. These only occur with chronic exposure to fluoride at far higher levels than the safe drinking limits. \u201cEverything is a poison at high enough levels \u2013 even water,\u201d Jones said. In August, the US\u2019s National Toxicology Program released a review suggesting a link between fluoride exposure above 1.5mg of fluoride per litre of water and lower IQ in children. However, experts have pointed out that there is a lack of high quality research on the topic. \u201cSome studies \u2026 were considered as having a high risk of bias in other systematic reviews,\u201d Do said. Do\u2019s own research has found no association between drinking fluoridated water before age five and changes in behavioural development or executive functioning. What countries add fluoride to water? Dozens of countries artificially fluoridate drinking water. As of 2012, about 435 million people globally have access to water with fluoride at recommended levels. The US, UK, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Brazil are among the countries that add fluoride to water in at least some regions. Do said adding fluoride to water was a good method to reduce socioeconomic inequality in dental health. \u201cIt\u2019s a passive way to reduce dental caries.\u201d What could change if Donald Trump wins the US election? Kennedy, who Donald Trump has promised to put in charge of health initiatives, said on Saturday that the Republican would push to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected president. Kennedy has emerged as one of Trump\u2019s top surrogates after dropping out as independent candidate. On Sunday, Trump told NBC News that he and Kennedy had not spoken about fluoride, but that the plan \u201csounds OK to me\u201d. Where has fluoride been removed from water in the past and what was the effect? Authorities in several jurisdictions have removed fluoride from drinking water by public mandate, such as in Calgary, Canada in 2011, or by ministerial decree, such as in Israel in 2014. Research shows that dental cavities in children increased in Calgary after the end of fluoridation, while the rates of dental treatment significantly increased in Israel. Calgary is set to re-introduce fluoridation in 2025. Germany stopped fluoridating its water in the 1970s and never reintroduced it, but since 1991 has sold salt with added fluoride.

Fulham and Brentford might be as different as Harrods is to Hounslow, but right now the two west London clubs are eerily similar. Having lost their best player in the summer (Jo\u00e3o Palhinha and Ivan Toney), the two clubs have started this season well, all things considered, and lie 11th and 12th respectively, one point apart, both with a net goal difference of zero. </p> <p>Fulham are arguably the stronger team right now, but Brentford have the better manager. Both will be aiming for a top-half finish, but would probably take survival come the season\u2019s end. Both sides have come close to beating City at the Etihad this season and both have lost to Manchester United. The point is, nobody knows what the ceiling or the bottom is for either side. And that, like watching Adama Traor\u00e9, is quite exciting. </p> <p>It\u2019s a derby under the lights. Join me. </p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 8pm GMT. </p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Dimitar Berbatov, formerly of Fulham and one of Sky Sports\u2019 pundits in the studio tonight, has this to say: After these sorts of games, this is when babies are made. That\u2019s all from me. Thanks for reading, and for your posh club suggestions via email. Congratulations to Fulham, and Harry Wilson in particular. Until next time. Cheers! Harry Wilson speaks to the cameras: Amazing feeling to come on and get the two winners. I thought we were the better team, we had them penned in. He said to play in the pocket and when the ball goes wide, get into the box. On the first goal, which replays show actually came off his shin! I\u2019m just trying to help it on, really. If it doesn\u2019t go in, then I\u2019m trying to help it towards the back post for someone else. On the second goal, which replays show came off Wilson\u2019s shoulder! The second goal was lucky. It was meant to be a header and go in the other corner, but it\u2019s come off my shoulder. They all count. Here\u2019s to the posh football clubs, then. \u201cWith the caveat that Iceland is neither populous enough, nor has the imperialist history, for proper poshness, there\u2019s a club called Stjarnan that really plays up its upper-classness\u201d writes K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cThey\u2019re from a well-to-do suburb of Reykjav\u00edk, and their fan club is called \u2018The Silver Spoon\u2019. They\u2019re probably best known outside the country for a video of their choreographed celebrations\u201d. I can\u2019t stop watching Wilson\u2019s first goal. He has definitely meant that, or at least A Fulham friend of mine, George Dennis, has just texted me. \u201cHarry Wilson only scores bangers\u201d. He\u2019s not wrong. Insane. Just insane. But you can\u2019t say that Fulham don\u2019t deserve that win. The home side are up to ninth with that victory. A really tough one to swallow for Brentford, who have lost every one of their five away matches this season. What a finish to the game. 90+9 min: Craven Cottage has erupted. There are fans on the pitch. It\u2019s absolute bedlam. Wilson has done it! Off the bench, the Welshman has scored two in injury time to seal the most unlikely of comebacks! Robinson wriggles free on the left, floats in a hopeful cross to the penalty spot. Wilson, all 5ft 8in of him, heads towards goal. It\u2019s not an effort with power, but Flekken is flat footed and the ball creeps inside the near post. Wilson has scored with pretty much the final touch of the game! Wow. 90+6 min: Brentford nearly nick a winner at the last! Roerslev gets to the byline, cuts the ball back to Carvalho, who fires at goal from all of eight yards. Leno reads the shot and makes a point-blank save and Fulham\u2019s defenders make two blocks to scramble the ball away! 90+4 min: Two goal-of-the-month contenders tonight, that could not have been more different. Oh. My. Word. Wilson has just scored an absolutely sensational goal. Perhaps the smallest player on the pitch scores from a cross to the near post. The Welshman delicately flicks it, a sort-of improvised backheel, with the ball spinning over Flekken and into the top corner! It looks like a lucky finish, but I\u2019m fairly certain Wilson has meant that! An absolutely sensational equaliser. 90+1 min: Fulham have had 24 shots to Brentford\u2019s three and 67% possession. 90 min: Six added minutes here. Through a combination of towering centre backs and excellent goalkeeping (Flekken catching crosses), Brentford are sitting deep and dealing well with the missiles being thrown into their box. 89 min: Bassey tries his luck from range \u2026 the ball fizzing towards Flekken, who saves and collects at the second attempt. 88 min: It\u2019s all hands on deck for Brentford. Collins and Mee make two huge blocks to deny Traor\u00e9 and Castagne. 87 min: More changes: Brentford being on Ben Mee for Mbeumo. The Bees shift to a back five. 86 min: A reminder that only West Ham and the bottom three clubs (Ipswich, Southampton and Wolves) have conceded more goals than Brentford so far this season. This would be a huge clean sheet, and the first in the Premier League this campaign. 84 min: Cairney and Harry Wilson, two remarkably similar players in style, both come on for Fulham, replacing Smith Rowe and Nelson. 82 min: A break in play, with Roerslev receiving treatment for a blow to the face. The stoppage certainly suits Brentford and Fulham are becoming frustrated. \u201cRe posh football clubs, I suggest Racing Santander, whose stadium is very near the Sardinero beach, a very upmarket area of the city\u201d, emails Anthony Ashworth, from Alicante. \u201cThe richest man in Spain (and Seve Ballesteros\u2019 father-in-law), banker Emilio Bot\u00edn, lived literally just up the road.\u201d 81 min: Credit to Brentford, who are preposterously organised at the back. This is not the most exciting performance, but Thomas Frank will not care one bit if they come away with a clean sheet and a 1-0 win. 79 min: Traor\u00e9 has definitely made a difference since coming on. Fulham look a little short of ideas otherwise. 77 min: And when a good cross does come into the Brenford box from open play, there are nowhere near enough bodies in the box. Muniz is all alone in there! 75 min: Another really poor corner for Fulham, which fails to beat the first man. Nelson is the guilty party there. 73 min: Both sides make substitutions as the game enters its final stage. Brentford make three changes: Jensen for Damsgaard, Schade for Wissa and Carvalho for Lewis-Potter. Carvalho gets an almighty boo from the Fulham fans, having left Craven Cottage for Anfield in 2022 in a cut-price deal. Fulham make two like-for-like subs: Timothy Castagne for Kenny Tete and Rodrigo Muniz for Raul Jimenez. 71 min: More Fulham pressure, but Brentford are holding firm. Fulham have two corners, but having scored precisely zero goals from corners this season, they come to nothing. 69 min: \u201cApparently beach-fronting Botafogo is a very upscale part of Rio De Janeiro\u201d emails Alun Williams. \u201cI only know because a football feature - Football Focus? - did a feature on Clarence Seedorf, when he signed for the club. A very nice part of the world!\u201d I might also offer Sampdoria as a posh option, although perhaps not on the scale of Fulham. Genoa are seen as the more working-class club in the city, despite their official title being the Genoa Cricket and Football Club (and playing in the same stadium as Sampdoria). 67 min: Traor\u00e9 has his first run at Van den Berg, and there is an expectant roar from the home crowd. The Spaniard crosses into the box, and there are shouts for a penalty, but the referee waves play on. 65 min: Here comes that first Fulham change, Traor\u00e9 for Andreas Pereira, who has offered little in truth. With Traor\u00e9 going to the right wing, that might mean Smith Rowe drops deeper to cover for Pereira. 63 min: Iwobi bends in a beautiful cross into the \u2018corridor of uncertainty\u2019 between centre-backs and goalkeeper, and Mbeumo does well to clear the ball at the back post, with Nelson loitering. Mbeumo has done more defending than attacking tonight! 61 min: Still no change for either side, which is something of a surprise, particularly for Fulham. Rodrigo Muniz, Cairney, Traore all lurking on the bench. 59 min: A real chance for Brentford, after a brilliant, improvised pass from Norgaard, who has quietly been one of the best players on the pitch. The Dane released Lewis-Potter on the left, in acres of space. The former Hull City winger cuts in on his right foot and fires wildly over the bar. A waste. 57 min: Eeeeeeeeeesh, a really nasty challenge by Roerslev on Smith Rowe. A yellow card for the Brentford right back. Smith Rowe limps on. I\u2019m surprised he isn\u2019t more hurt. 54 min: This is threatening to turn into a good game. Both teams are pushing for another goal. Iwobi gets free on the left but the Fulham man\u2019s cross is poor. Lewis-Potter then repeats the trick for Brentford, darting beyond Andersen but can\u2019t beat Tete at the near post with his own cross. 52 min: Bassey steps into midfield to make a thunderous tackle, as Fulham go on the attack again. Iwobi finds Smith Rowe, who drives to the byline but is foiled by Norgaard, who makes an outstanding block. Those are the sort of interventions that can be goal saving, but don\u2019t show up on the stats. 50 min: Nelson and Iwobi combine, with the latter wriggling free on the edge of Brentford\u2019s box, flashing a shot just a couple of yards wide. Better from Fulham. 48 min: Wissa, who has been conspicuous from his passiveness, almost connects with a lovely early cross from Lewis-Potter. Bassey gets a clumsy but vital touch on the delivery to take the ball away from the Brentford forward. Peeeeeep! We\u2019re underway again at Craven Cottage. No changes made by either side. Correction: Janelt\u2019s goal was from 29 yards, not 25. And it didn\u2019t go in the top corner, more half-way up the goal, but still a stonking strike. Quite funny that this was Jamie Carragher\u2019s pre-match analysis \u2026 Half-time reading: An absolutely brilliant goal for Brentford, who have otherwise been quite poor. 45 min: Brentford nearly steal a second. Lewis-Potter squares a pass to Janelt, who is clearly in the mood and tries his luck from range again \u2026 deflected just wide! Two minutes added on for injury time. 43 min: What a miss from Smith Rowe! The 24-year-old fails to connect with a brilliant Iwobi cross at the near post. The ball comes off Smith Rowe\u2019s shoulder, hits Pinnock and Flekken is able to make a much easier save than he should have had. Flekken actually spilled the ball, but Van den Berg was there to clean up. How are Fulham not winning this? 39 min: Damsgaard, who has improved a lot this season, has been particularly poor tonight. Getting physically bossed by Berge and Iwobi and hasn\u2019t had the time to pick a pass. Brentford have been dreadful with the ball, but find themselves ahead. 36 min: A penny for the thoughts of Rodrigo Muniz, who hit a real hot streak for Fulham last season but hasn\u2019t really featured this season. The Brazilian will be frustrated watching this, as Fulham are sending in some excellent crosses into the box, but Jimenez is being completely bossed by Brentford\u2019s defenders. 33 min: More of the same as Fulham press for an equaliser. Robinson and Nelson look like the home side\u2019s biggest threat. Roerslev looks like the weak link for Brentford. 31 min: \u201cJanelt\u2019s goal is one of my favorite kinds, when a team pings the ball around in the space in front of the opposition penalty box until one player has two yards of space to himself, picks his spot and absolutely leathers it in the net. I bet Brentford have worked on how to score from distance\u201d. They scored seven from outside the box last season, which had them joint ninth (with Fulham) in the Premier League table of that metric. 28 min: Fulham are enjoying lots of possession in Brentford\u2019s half but with the away side dropping deeper, there is little space inside the box. Jimenez isn\u2019t getting much change out of Pinnock and Collins. 26 mins: \u201cVitaly, wooooaah. Vitaly, woooooah. He comes from Germany. And now he is a Bee\u201d, sing the away fans. Certainly a goal of the month contender right there. Bassey loses the ball, Brentford exchange a couple of passes and Janelt let\u2019s rip from 25 yards \u2026 and the ball flies into the top corner. What a hit! Out of nothing, Brentford are ahead! Wow, that\u2019s their first shot on target. 22 min: Is Lewis-Potter good? Have watched him on countless occasions and still don\u2019t know. 20 min: Brentford simply can\u2019t get out of Fulham\u2019s press, with Berge patrolling the midfield, and Fulham so nearly take the lead. Nelson, who has settled on being a left winger for now, bumbles his way through a couple of challenges and fires just wide! The home side are well on top, but need something to show for it. 17 min: Fulham fans must be loving this. This is surely their most exciting side since the one that lost to Atl\u00e9tico in the 2010 Europa League final. 15 min: Liquid football from Fulham! It\u2019s one-touch stuff, with Smith Rowe, Andreas Pereira and Robinson all combining, the latter playing a brilliant pass inside Brentford\u2019s full back (Roerslev) to release Smith Rowe, who tried to bend it inside the far post, but saw his shot deflected wide for a corner. That could easily have deflected into Brentford\u2019s net. Honestly, that was one of the moves of the season. 12 min: This is intended as a compliment but I\u2019m not sure exactly where Nelson is playing for Fulham. He\u2019s popped up on both flanks and now drives forward centrally in the No 10 position, carrying the ball a full 40 yards until Collins expertly barges him off the ball. 10 min: Flekken is down, looks like he has possibly tweaked his knee? The Dutchman will continue but is wincing. No Premier League keeper has made more saves than Flekken, on 47 stops. 8 min: Nearly an own goal, as Robinson shepherds the ball back towards Leno. Mbeumo gives the Fulham full-back a shove and the ball nearly deflects past Leno, who gets something on the ball. Fulham scramble the ball away. 6 min: Nelson pops up on the left and drives unopposed into the Brentford box, forcing Flekken into a sharp save at his near post. The ball rebounds back to Nelson but Flekken again closes the angle. Good double save! 4 min: Pinnock, forced towards his own corner flag with a wayward pass, does exceptionally well to keep the ball in and skip past Nelson to start a Brentford attack. \u201cWhen Thomas Frank praises Ethan Pinnock for having been a mountain for Brentford, I wonder how Sepp van den Berg must feel (Berg is Dutch for \u2018mountain\u2019)\", email Peter Oh. Van den Berg, normally a centre-back, is playing left back tonight. A knock-off Gvardiol, if you like. 2 min: Fulham start well, and Smith Rowe is at the heart of it, linking the play well outside Brentford\u2019s box and setting up Jimenez for a (weak) shot, straight at Flekken. Peeeeeeeep! We\u2019re off. The teams are out! Emile Smith Rowe\u2019s socks are pulled suitably low. Two wreaths are laid in the centre circle in honour of Remembrance Day, which is a week today. The Last Post is played and impeccably observed. \u201cSurely Peterborough are the Poshest club in England\u201d, emails Richard Hirst, an \u201cAn unposh Fulham supporter\u201d. You\u2019ve done me, Richard. Craven Cottage is a special ground, isn\u2019t it? This is the current Premier League table. Fulham are undoubtedly the poshest club in England. Does anyone know of a posher club in the world? Usual answers to michael.butler@theguardian.com or via X: @michaelbutler18. Traor\u00e9 has been a bit hit and miss recently, so not that surprising to see Marco Silva drop him to the bench for Reiss Nelson, who joins former Gunners Bernd Leno, Emile Smith Rowe and Alex Iwobi in Fulham\u2019s starting XI. And what a substitute Traor\u00e9 is to bring on later in the game when Brentford legs are cramping up. Just in case you missed this after Brentford\u2019s last game, this was quite some speech by Thomas Frank in congratulating Ethan Pinnock on 100 Premier League appearances. Pinnock, who played non-league football with Dulwich Hamlet for the first six years of his career, starts again tonight for No 101. Fulham: Leno, Tete, Andersen, Bassey, Robinson, Andreas Pereira, Berge, Nelson, Smith Rowe, Iwobi, Jimenez. Subs: Benda, Reed, Wilson, Rodrigo Muniz, Cairney, Traore, Castagne, Sessegnon, Diop. Brentford: Flekken, Roerslev, Collins, Pinnock, van den Berg, Norgaard, Janelt, Mbeumo, Damsgaard, Lewis-Potter, Wissa. Subs: Valdimarsson, Schade, Jensen, Carvalho, Mee, Yarmolyuk, Meghoma, Konak, Maghoma. Hello everyone. Fulham and Brentford might be as different as Harrods is to Hounslow, but right now the two west London clubs are eerily similar. Having lost their best player in the summer (Jo\u00e3o Palhinha and Ivan Toney), the two clubs have started this season well, all things considered, and lie 11th and 12th respectively, one point apart, both with a net goal difference of zero. Fulham are arguably the stronger team right now, but Brentford have the better manager. Both will be aiming for a top-half finish, but would probably take survival come the season\u2019s end. Both sides have come close to beating City at the Etihad this season and both have lost to Manchester United. The point is, nobody knows what the ceiling or the bottom is for either side. And that, like watching Adama Traor\u00e9, is quite exciting. It\u2019s a derby under the lights. Join me. Kick-off: 8pm GMT.",

      "bodyText": "The Middle East crisis blog is now closing. Thank you for following along. Please see the main news page to see all the latest news from the region. Israel has formally informed the United Nations of its intention to sever ties entirely with the UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees in a move the country\u2019s allies and aid workers warn will deepen the humanitarian crisis in the Middle East. The Knesset passed two bills last week banning Unrwa from Israeli territory and prohibiting Israeli state contact with the agency on the basis of allegations that Hamas had infiltrated it. The ban will take effect in three months but in the first step towards implementing the Knesset vote, the Israeli ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, sent a letter to the UN secretary general and the president of the general assembly officially withdrawing Israel from a 1967 cooperation agreement with Unrwa. \u201cDespite the overwhelming evidence we submitted to the UN that substantiate[s] Hamas\u2019s infiltration of Unrwa, the UN did nothing to rectify the situation,\u201d Danon wrote on X on Monday. Israel has taken some measures to increase aid access to Gaza but has so far failed to significantly turn around the humanitarian situation in the territory, state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Monday, as a deadline set by the US to improve the situation approaches. The Biden administration told Israel in a letter it had 30 days to take specific steps to address the dire humanitarian crisis in the strip, which has been pummeled for more than a year by Israeli ground and air operations that Israel says are aimed at rooting out Hamas militants. Aid workers and UN officials say humanitarian conditions continue to be dire in Gaza. \u201cAs of today, the situation has not significantly turned around. We have seen an increase in some measurements. We\u2019ve seen an increase in the number of crossings that are open. But just if you look at the stipulated recommendations in the letter, those have not been met,\u201d Miller said. Miller said the results so far were \u201cnot good enough\u201d but stressed that the 30-day period had not elapsed. He declined to say what consequences Israel would face if it failed to implement the recommendations. Here are the latest headlines this evening: Israel claims to have killed two senior Hezbollah commanders in southern Lebanon in two separate strikes, as it continues its attacks on what it calls terrorist infrastructure. Lebanese authorities have put the death toll from Israeli airstrikes in the country at over 2,800. Israel\u2019s military has said Hezbollah has fired more than 60 rockets into Israeli-controlled territory during the course of Monday. There were no reports of any casualties Ten people have been reported killed by Israeli airstrikes inside Gaza. The Hamas-led health authority there has said that 33 people were killed in the previous 24 hours. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty figures being issued during the conflict Palestinian authorities in the Israeli-occupied West Bank have said that a massacre was narrowly avoided after an arson attack attributed to Israeli settlers on a building and about 20 cars in Al-Bireh, near to Ramallah. Witness said ten people poured liquid on the cars to torch them. Israeli security forces say they are investigating the incident. Israel\u2019s foreign ministry has said in a statement it has formally notified the UN that the country will ban the UN\u2019s Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, from operating inside Israel within 90 days. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that 94,431 children under the age of 10 got a polio vaccine over the weekend, which represents 79% of the target in northern Gaza. At least 90% vaccination of a population is needed to stop the spread of the virus. Leaks from Netanyahu\u2019s office may have compromised a peace deal, an Israeli court finds. A breakdown in peace negotiations may have been caused by leaked and falsified documents involving a close aide to the prime minister, an Israeli court has said. The leaking of the documents \u2013 to Britain\u2019s Jewish Chronicle and Germany\u2019s tabloid Bild \u2013 came at a crucial time for hostage negotiations. Israel have attacked the Syrian capital of Damascus. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said the strikes hit a house \u201cused by members of Hezbollah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard\u201d, in a farm in the Sayyeda Zeinab area. The Lebanese health ministry has said that the death toll in Lebanon has crossed 3,000 in the Israel-Hezbollah war, which has been so far going on for 13 months. The director of the last partially functioning hospital in north Gaza, says he does not understand the purpose behind the bombing. \u201cAt this moment, occupation forces are continuing to violently bombard and destroy Kamal Adwan Hospital, targeting all parts of the hospital,\u201d the Gaza Health Ministry told Reuters Israel acknowledges attack on alleged Hezbollah intelligence headquarters in Syria. Israel\u2019s military said its air force struck the intelligence headquarters of Hezbollah\u2019s Syrian branch in a strike on Damascus on Monday, an attack that claimed the lives of two people believed to be Hezbollah members. Warplanes \u201cconducted an aerial operation and struck Hezbollah terror targets belonging to Hezbollah\u2019s intelligence headquarters in Syria\u201d, the military said in a statement. The Syria branch \u201cincludes an independent intelligence gathering, coordination, and assessment network\u201d, the military said, adding that the attack aimed to degrade Hezbollah\u2019s intelligence capabilities. The strikes hit a house \u201cused by members of Hezbollah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard\u201d at a farm, the The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said. Syria\u2019s foreign ministry condemned the attack, saying it targeted \u201ccivilian areas\u201d south of Damascus. Syrian state media said the strike occurred at approximately 2:18 pm (British time) and came \u201cfrom the direction of the occupied Golan Heights\u201d. Israel has killed at least 16 people and injured 90 others in Lebanon on Monday, according to the Health Ministry\u2019s latest figures. A ministry statement says fatalities caused by Israeli attacks have risen to 3,002 with 13,492 others injured since October 2023. Meanwhile Hebollah says it bombed targets in Kidmat Tzvi and the Ayelet Hashahar area in northern Israel. Israel is bracing itself for another Iranian attack after a crescendo of threatening rhetoric from leaders in Iran warning that the country would retaliate for an Israeli missile strikes last month. Iran initially played down the impact of the 26 October Israeli strikes on its military facilities, which were in turn a response to an Iranian ballistic missile attack on Israel at the beginning of October. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, gave an initially ambivalent verdict on the Israeli strikes, saying that the attack \u201cshould not be exaggerated nor downplayed\u201d while Tehran weighed a response\u2026 Juliette Touma, UNRWA director of communications, said UNRWA received one formal accusation directly from Israeli authorities, alleging 100 staff were associated with Palestinian armed groups. Touma said Israel has not responded to their requests for evidence. Israel told the United Nations it\u2019s cancelling the agreement that regulated its relations with the UN relief organisation for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) because Hamas was operating within the organisation. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the UN \u201cwas presented with countless pieces of evidence that Hamas operatives are employed by UNRWA and about the use of UNRWA facilities for terrorist purposes \u2013 yet nothing was done about this\u201d. The Lebanese health ministry has said that the death toll in Lebanon has crossed 3,000 in the Israel-Hezbollah war, which has been so far going on for 13 months. Further to our post of 16.02 reporting Israeli strikes in Damascus, AFP has the following: At least two Hezbollah members were killed on Monday near the Sayyeda Zeinab area south of Damascus, home to an important Shia sanctuary and guarded by pro-Iranian groups, a war monitor said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said the strikes hit a house \u201cused by members of Hezbollah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard\u201d, in a farm in the Sayyeda Zeinab area. Israel\u2019s military has intensified its strikes on targets in Syria since it launched its war on Hezbollah in neighbouring Lebanon more than a month ago. Two Hezbollah members were killed and several others were wounded, according to the monitor. Syrian state media also reported the strikes but said they only caused material damage. Mehdi Mahfouz, 34, who lives nearby, said he \u201cheard three successive explosions, one of which was very strong. Then I saw a large black cloud of smoke rising.\u201d The blasts were heard in the neighbouring Jaramana suburb of Damascus, according to an AFP photographer, as ambulances headed to the area. The director of the last partially functioning hospital in north Gaza says he does not understand the purpose behind the bombing. \u201cAt this moment, occupation forces are continuing to violently bombard and destroy Kamal Adwan hospital, targeting all parts of the hospital,\u201d the Gaza health ministry told Reuters Hospital director Hossam Abu Safieh said in a statement that the situation was \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and that \u201cthe army did not contact the hospital before directly targeting it.\u201d \u201cSeveral of our staff have been injured, and we are unable to leave the hospital,\u201d he said of the facility in the northern city of Beit Lahia. \u201cWe do not understand the purpose behind this bombing that is targeting the hospital.\u201d Al Jazeera reports that Israel has attacked the Syrian capital of Damascus. This news comes hours after Israeli special forces captured a man in Syria accused of helping an Iranian network to gather intelligence on targets in Israel, the military said. \u201cThe operation prevented a future attack and led to the exposure of the operational methods of Iranian terror networks located near the Golan Heights. Al-Assi was transferred for further investigation,\u201d the military said in a statement on X More to follow \u2026 Gaza\u2019s health ministry says it may be making its \u201clast distress call\u201d as the IDF bears down on Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza. The ministry says that Israeli soldiers \u201ccontinue to bomb and destroy\u201d the hospital, affecting all its facilities. \u201cThere are many injuries among the medical staff and patients. The medical staff cannot move between the hospital departments and cannot save their injured colleagues,\u201d the ministry says. Fadi was praying on Wednesday afternoon when the ground began to shake. At first he thought it was an earthquake, but then he saw a plume of smoke rising from his house. He rushed home and began to dig. One by one, he pulled family members from the rubble, all eight of them killed in an Israeli airstrike. \u201cI pulled my brother out of the rubble in pieces. I found his four-year-old daughter\u2019s hand in the branches of an olive tree 20 metres away,\u201d he said. The owner of a gaming cafe in Bednayel, a town on the outskirts of the historic eastern Lebanese city of Baalbek, he asked only to be identified by his first name for fear of being targeted by the Israeli drones that circled overhead. The day before, Fadi\u2019s brother Ali had asked him if his family could stay at his house since they lived next to a petrol station and he feared it would blow up in the event of an Israeli bombing; a local family had burned to death in an earlier Israeli bombing and Ali did not want his wife and two children to suffer the same fate\u2026 A breakdown in peace negotiations may have been caused by leaked and falsified documents involving a close aide to the prime minister, an Israeli court has said. The leaking of the documents \u2013 to Britain\u2019s Jewish Chronicle and Germany\u2019s tabloid Bild \u2013 came at a crucial time for hostage negotiations. The documents claimed Hamas were going to smuggle Israeli hostages to Egypt, jeopardising any peace arrangement. Over 100 hostages out of 251 taken by Hamas on 7 October 2023 are still captive and their whereabout remains unclear. Commentators say the leaks were made to protect Netanyahu who faces a strong possibility criminal charges for allegedly accepting bribes. Benny Gantz, who until recently was in Netanyahu\u2019s war cabinet, said that if sensitive security information was used for a \u201cpolitical survival campaign\u201d, it would not only be a criminal offence but also \u201ca crime against the nation\u201d. The leader of the opposition, Yair Lapid, argued that if the prime minister was aware of the leaks, \u201che is complicit in one of the most serious security offenses\u201d and that if he wasn\u2019t aware, he shouldn\u2019t be in office. Families of the hostages stated that it is \u201ca moral low that has no depth. This is a fatal injury to the remnants of trust between the government and its citizens\u201d. It is approaching 5pm in Beirut, Tel Aviv and Gaza City. Here are the latest headlines \u2026 Israel claims to have killed two senior Hezbollah commanders in southern Lebanon in two separate strikes, as it continues its attacks on what it calls terrorist infrastructure. Lebanese authorities have put the death toll from Israeli airstrikes in the country at over 2,800 Israel\u2019s military has said Hezbollah has fired more than 60 rockets into Israeli-controlled territory during the course of Monday.

At least 90% vaccination of a population is needed to stop the spread of the virus A Lebanese MP has accused Israel of attempting to turn areas in the south of the country into \u201cburnt out areas where there is no way to live even after the end of the war and attacks.\u201d The National News Agency quotes MP Ali Khreis speaking after an inspection of areas in the south. He is quoted as saying: These southern villages and towns are struggling against the Zionist machine. Lebanon expressed and stated \u2026 that we want to implement UN Resolution 1701, and we want the Lebanese army to protect the borders and maintain security and stability, and that the presence of Unifil is an international guarantee for implementing the international resolution. Israel\u2019s military has claimed that it is carrying out \u201climited, localized, targeted raids based on precise intelligence in thicketed terrain along the border fence in southern Lebanon, where the Hezbollah terrorist organisation has established itself,\u201d but Lebanese authorities have put the death toll from Israeli airstrikes inside the country at over 2,800 dead. Before and after satellite photographs have shown the extent of destruction wrought by Israeli attacks on a village in the south of Lebanon. Israel has been accused of breaking international humanitarian law by opening fire on Unifil peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon. Juliette Touma, global communications officer for Unrwa, the UN\u2019s Palestinian refugee agency, has spoken to Al Jazeera from Amman in Jordan. Israel this morning said it had formally notified the UN that it would be banning the agency from operating inside Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Touma told the news agency: Who is going to replace Unrwa? When this brutal war finally comes to an end, who will provide education to 400,000 children who go to Unrwa schools, who? What is the plan? We don\u2019t have any answer to that. We are the only UN agency in the world that runs 700 schools. In the absence of a political solution for Palestinian refugees, there is no alternative to Unrwa. It\u2019s easy to talk. The question is what are you going to do about the ban and how are you going to fill the void? You meaning the state of Israel. On Monday last week Israel\u2019s parliament voted to ban the agency from the country within 90 days. Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government has also banned Al Jazeera from operating inside Israel, as well as raided its offices in Ramallah. Lebanon\u2019s media reports that Israeli forces continue to target areas in the south of the country with artillery fire and airstrikes. Israel\u2019s military has said that as of 3pm local time (1pm GMT), \u201capproximately 60 projectiles that were fired by Hezbollah\u201d had crossed into Israel or Israeli-controlled territory. In an operational update via Telegram, the IDF claimed to have located and destroyed underground infrastructure belonging to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, and said \u201ctroops located terrorist infrastructure, military sites, weapons stockpiles, a missile storage facility, and compounds designated for infiltrating into Israeli territory.\u201d The claims have not been independently verified. AFP reports it has spoken to a witness to the arson attack in the Israeli-occupied West Bank city of Al-Bireh, near Ramallah. Ihab al-Zabin, a resident of the building damaged in the attack, which also saw about 20 cars torched, told the news agency he saw around ten people he identified as settlers \u201cpouring liquids on vehicles in front of the building and then setting them on fire.\u201d He said \u201cI yelled from my apartment, and at that moment they ran away. When I went down with my neighbours to put out the fire, settlers shot towards us.\u201d AFP reports that Laila Ghannam, governor of Ramallah and Al-Bireh, told journalists at the scene \u201cthere could have been a massacre in this building\u201d, which residents say housed more than 60 people. She said the attacks were increasing because the settlers were treated by Israeli authorities with \u201cimpunity\u201d. About 490,000 settlers live in settlements considered illegal under international law in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967. About three million Palestinians live in the occupied West Bank territory. Israeli media reports that graffiti left nearby during the attack said \u201cwar on Judea and Samaria\u201d. Settlers often refer to the West Bank as Judea and Samaria, after two ancient Israelite kingdoms. These terms are also used administratively by the Israeli government. Rami Omar, head of the local civil defence office, said the incident happened at 3.30am, and an Israeli security official told AFP notification of the incident came at 4am. Israeli police and the Shin Bet have said they are investigating. Al-Zabin said he saw the arsonists run away towards the nearby Israeli settlement of Beit El. Reuters reports that three people have been killed by an Israeli strike on a house in Nuseirat camp in Gaza. Citing local medics for the information, it takes the total number of people reported killed today in Gaza to ten. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Gaza. Both Reuters and Palestinian news agency Wafa are reporting that medical sources in Gaza have told the agencies that seven people have been killed on Monday by an Israeli airstrike in Beit Lahia in the north of Gaza. Numerous people were reported injured with some reported missing. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that 94,431 children under the age of 10 got a polio vaccine over the weekend, which represents 79% of the target in northern Gaza. At least 90% vaccination of a population is needed to stop the spread of the virus. About 15,000 children are thought to be a zone besieged by Israeli ground forces in Beit Hanoun, Beit Latiya and Jabalia in the northern governorate, and they cannot be reached because of military operations. The humanitarian pause the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) agreed to did not include that zone. The IDF denies involvement in a blast at a clinic in Sheikh Radwan on Saturday, where six people were reported injured, four of them children, while vaccinations were going on. The IDF put out a tweet referring to a bomb attack near the Sheikh Radwan clinic by \u201cterrorist organisations\u201d while a humanitarian convoy was passing, saying that six children at the clinic had been injured in the explosion. But the incident it refers to is supposed to have happened on Sunday, not Saturday. The WHO says there was a blast near its convoy on Sunday to evacuate patients and health workers from besieged hospitals in the north, but it said the convoy was not affected. The Guardian is asking the IDF for further clarification. Germany urges Israel to allow more aid into north Gaza to help the \u201cunbearable\u201d situation in the region. A spokesperson for the German foreign ministry said: \u201cWe call on the Israeli government urgently to meet its responsibilities under international law. \u201cIsrael has the right to self-defence against Hamas within the framework of humanitarian international law.\u201d The spokesperson\u2019s comments were in response to the ultimatum the United States imposed on Israel to improve humanitarian assistance. If Israel fails, Washington has said it will restrict military aid. Kamala Harris pledged that as president she would \u2018do everything in my power to end the war in Gaza\u2019 in her final rally in Michigan on Sunday, as she tried to appeal to the state\u2019s large Arab American and Muslim populations. She said she would also work to bring home hostages, ensure Israeli security, end the suffering of the Palestinian people and ensure their \u2018dignity, freedom and self-determination\u2019 Reporting for Haaretz, Bar Peleg writes that another arrest has been made on Monday in Israel after a joint investigation by the police, internal security services and the army into a suspected \u201cbreach of national security.\u201d Peleg writes: An Israeli Court ruled on Sunday evening that the leak of military intelligence from the IDF to the prime minister\u2019s office, and subsequently to foreign media outlets, could have harmed the security services\u2019 ability to secure the release of the hostages held in Gaza by Hamas. The court allowed the publication of the name of Eli Feldstein, the spokesperson in Netanyahu\u2019s circle who is suspected in the case. It was also revealed that the three other detainees being questioned are members of the security establishment. Peleg says that the Shin Bet have made a further arrest today. Israel\u2019s military has issued a statement in which it claims to have killed \u201ca commander in the Hezbollah Radwan force\u2019s anti-tank missile system.\u201d Naming him as Riad Rida Ghazzawi, the IDF claimed he \u201cplanned and executed a significant amount of terrorist attacks, including firing anti-tank missiles at Israeli civilians and at IDF troops operating in southern Lebanon.\u201d Israel\u2019s military has been staging incursions inside Lebanon since 1 October, claiming to be targeting Hezbollah. Lebanese authorities have reported over 2,800 dead in Israeli attacks on Lebanon in the past month. Tens of thousands of Israelis have been forced to leave their homes in northern Israel due to repeated rocket fire from inside Lebanon. At least 50 rockets have been fired so far today according to IDF statements. A large number of people have also been displaced from their homes in Lebanon by the fighting. Earlier today Israel also stated it had killed a Hezbollah commander in the Baraachit area in southern Lebanon, who it named as Abu Ali Rida. The claims have not been independently verified. Israel\u2019s military has claimed to have intercepted \u201ca number of suspicious aerial targets that approached Israeli territory from east\u201d on Monday. Gaza\u2019s Hamas-led health ministry has issued updated casualty figures, reporting that 33 Palestinians were killed and 156 more injured by Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours. The ministry claims this takes the total death toll in the Gaza Strip since Israel began its military campaign against Hamas in October last year to 43,374 killed with 102,261 wounded. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty figures being issued during the conflict. Germany has called on Israel to let more humanitarian aid into north Gaza, where a lack of supplies has led to a \u201cdesperate\u201d and \u201cunbearable\u201d situation, a spokesperson for the German foreign ministry said on Monday. \u201cWe call on the Israeli government urgently to meet its responsibilities under international law,\u201d Reuters reports the spokesperson told a regular news conference in Berlin, adding \u201cIsrael has the right to self defence against Hamas within the framework of humanitarian international law.\u201d Earlier on Monday Israel announced that it had formally instructed the UN that it would be banning the Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa from operating inside Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that thousands of people in Halhul, north of Hebron in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, gathered today for the funeral of a 14-year-old child shot by Israeli security forces. Wafa reported that a general strike spread through Halhul during the funeral for Naji Nidal Al-Baba. Some news sources have given the child\u2019s age as 16. In a statement the UK-based Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) group has said that all three hospitals in northern Gaza are under attack. In the statement is said: All three remaining hospitals in northern Gaza are under attack. Kamal Adwan hospital has come under direct artillery fire, resulting in the serious injury of a child. Al Awda hospital has also been shelled, and Indonesian hospital hit by drone strikes. \u2060The Israeli military is killing and injuring hundreds of Palestinians a day and the patients in need of lifesaving care in northern Gaza are now left helpless under siege. These latest attacks by Israeli forces are part of a sustained assault on Gaza\u2019s health system, amounting to war crimes and the crime of extermination. Israel is making Palestinian survival in northern Gaza impossible as part of a policy of sustained pressure and forcible expulsion. The international community must not allow this brutality to go unchallenged. An earlier statement today by the Hamas-led health ministry in Gaza said that all three hospitals had been put out of operation. The statement from the Gaza\u2019s government media office, reported by Al Jazeera and Israeli media, said the \u201cnorthern district is devastated due to the ongoing Israeli aggression.\u201d It claimed that about 1,800 Palestinians had been killed and about 4,000 others wounded as a result of IDF operations in the north of the Gaza Strip over the past three weeks. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty figures being issued during the conflict. It accused the Israeli army of \u201ccontinuing to destroy civilian infrastructure\u201d, and halting the vaccination campaign for children in northern Gaza \u201cas part of its destruction plan.\u201d It described the area as \u201cdisaster-stricken\u201d. The claims have not been independently verified. A statement on Friday signed by the heads of UN agencies, including the UN children\u2019s agency Unicef and the World Food Programme, and other aid groups, warned that \u201cThe entire Palestinian population in north Gaza is at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine and violence.\u201d Israeli media is reporting that about 50 rockets have been fired into Israel from the direction of Lebanon so far on Monday. A barrage of 20 rockets was aimed at Western Galilee, with 30 aimed at Upper Galilee. Tens of thousands of Israelis have been displaced from their homes in northern Israel, with Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government setting their ability to return safely as a war aim for its campaign in Lebanon which it says targets Iranian-backed Hezbollah. Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency is reporting new Israeli air strikes on the south of the country. Israel\u2019s military has issued further details of the interceptions carried out this morning. It says that \u201cfour UAVs fired from both Lebanon and the east were intercepted by the IAF,\u201d stating that two were intercepted outside of Israel. Here are some of the latest images sent over the news wires from Gaza, Lebanon, Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israeli media reports that prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet today with opposition leader Yair Lapid for a security briefing. The Palestinian Authority\u2019s foreign ministry has issued a statement condemning the reported burning of cars by Israeli settlers in Al-Bireh in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. In a statement, the ministry said it condemned the \u201cbrutal attack\u201d in \u201cthe strongest terms\u201d, saying that \u201cit considers it an extension of the crimes of settler gangs throughout the West Bank, including occupied Jerusalem, and a copy of the manifestations of the genocide and displacement of our people in the Gaza Strip.\u201d It continued: The ministry affirms that the Jewish terrorist elements who stormed Al-Bireh would not have committed this heinous crime had they not felt protected, supported and immune from the political level in the occupying state, especially the ministers of the extreme Israeli right who openly incite against Palestinian citizens, their land and their property in full view. Senior members of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s coalition government have repeated stated their intention to prevent the creation of a Palestinian state and their desire to encourage further illegal settlements inside the West Bank. Al-Bireh is to the north-east of Ramallah. Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency reports that caretaker minister of the interior Bassam Mawlawi will convene a central internal security council meeting at noon to, it says, \u201cfollow up on security developments in light of the continued Israeli attacks on Lebanon.\u201d The caretaker minister is expected to make public remarks after the meeting. Palestinian news agency Wafa is reporting that one person has been injured after Israeli security forces opened fire near Bethlehem in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and also reports that Israel has detained one man in Beitunia, west of Ramallah. Israel\u2019s foreign ministry has said in a statement, reported by AFP, that it has formally notified the UN that the country will ban the UN\u2019s Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, from operating inside Israel. Unrwa operates 96 schools in the Israeli-occupied West Bank serving 45,000 students, as well as 43 health centres, food distribution services for refugee families, and psychological support services, according to the agency\u2019s website. It has played a crucial logistical role in facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid in Gaza, as well as providing shelters for displaced Palestinians. \u201cOn the instruction of foreign minister Israel Katz, the ministry of foreign affairs notified the UN of the cancellation of the agreement between the state of Israel and Unrwa,\u201d the foreign ministry said. Israel has alleged that 12 Unrwa employees took part in the Hamas attack inside southern Israel on 7 October 2023. The agency fired several staff members as a result of an independent inquiry, but says that Israel\u2019s wider accusations of staff in Gaza supporting Hamas are unfounded. In Monday\u2019s statement, Katz said \u201cUnrwa, the organisation whose employees participated in the 7 October massacre and many of whose employees are Hamas operatives, is part of the problem in the Gaza Strip and not part of the solution.\u201d Unrwa\u2019s mandate is to provide life-giving services to anyone who has \u201clost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict\u201d, a mission widened after the 1967 war, when the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories began. Foreign minister Katz disputed that cutting off Unrwa would damage the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, which has been besieged by Israeli forces and subjected to aerial bombardment for over a year. Nearly all of the territory\u2019s 2.4 million people have been displaced from their homes at least once. \u201cEven now, the vast majority of humanitarian aid to Gaza is delivered through other organisations, and only 13 percent of it is delivered through Uurwa,\u201d Katz said. \u201cThe state of Israel is committed to international law and will continue to facilitate the entrance of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip in a manner that does not harm the security of the citizens of Israel.\u201d Israel is yet to provide any proposal for how the functions of Unrwa would be replaced. Israel has been repeatedly accused of breaching international humanitarian law in its response to the 7 October attack. During a recent visit to the region, US secretary of state Antony Blinken cautioned Israel that the US was watching \u201cvery carefully\u201d for progress being made on stepping up the amount of aid being delivered to Gaza. Israel\u2019s ambassador to the UN Danny Danon said \u201cthe state of Israel will continue to cooperate with humanitarian organisations but not with organisations that promote terrorism against us.\u201d Palestinian media sources are reporting that between 15 and 20 cars were set alight in Al-Bireh in the Israeli-occupied West Bank by Israeli settlers. Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesperson for the Palestinian Authority, is quoted by news agency Wafa described the incident as a crime by \u201cterrorist settler militias.\u201d The Times of Israel reports that Israel\u2019s police force has said it has opened an investigation. Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that overnight Israel has continued its assault on Gaza, stating that \u201clocal sources reported hearing successive explosions north of the Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip, while the occupation\u2019s warplanes targeted the city of Rafah in the south.\u201d It said there were dead and wounded after the attacks. Wafa reports that one child was injured according to medical sources from the Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza. They told the news agency \u201cartillery shelling targeted the hospital wards, the nursery, the hospital yard and the water tanks.\u201d The claims have not been independently verified. In a message on its official Telegram channel, Israel\u2019s military has claimed that on Monday morning it had intercepted what it termed \u201ca suspicious aerial target\u201d that crossed into Israeli-controlled territory \u201cfrom the east\u201d. There were no reports of any casualties. In the same message the IDF said it had also intercepted \u201ca suspicious aerial target in the Upper Galilee area\u201d that had crossed into Israeli territory from Lebanon. Emanuel Fabian, who reports for the Times of Israel, posted to suggest that two drones had headed towards Israeli-controlled territory from Iraq. In a message on its official Telegram channel, Israel\u2019s military has claimed to have killed a Hezbollah commander who it names as Abu Ali Rida. It said he commanded the Baraachit area in southern Lebanon. The IDF described him as being \u201cresponsible for planning and executing rocket and anti-tank missile attacks on IDF troops.\u201d In the operational update, Israel said: IDF troops continue to conduct limited, localised, targeted raids in southern Lebanon, dismantling terrorist infrastructure, locating weapons, and eliminating terrorists. Huge swathes of Lebanon\u2019s population have been displaced from their homes by Israel\u2019s military action against Hezbollah. According to Lebanese authorities, more than 2,800 people have been killed inside Lebanon by Israeli attacks. Tens of thousands of Israelis in the north of the country have also been displaced from their homes by near constant rocket frie from Hezbollah and other anti-Israeli forces inside Lebanon. Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s continued coverage of the conflict in the Middle East. Here are the latest headlines \u2026 In a strike inside Lebanon, Israel has claimed to kill a Hezbollah commander responsible, the IDF said, for \u201cplanning and executing rocket and anti-tank missile attacks on IDF troops\u201d Israel\u2019s military said that on Monday morning it had intercepted what it called \u201ca suspicious aerial target\u201d heading towards Israeli-controlled territory from the east A polio vaccination centre and the car of a UN aid official involved in this weekend\u2019s vaccination campaign came under fire despite a promised \u201chumanitarian pause\u201d in Israeli bombardment, the UN has said At least 43,341 Palestinian people have been killed and 102,105 injured in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is at the centre of a new political storm related to a hostage deal in the Gaza war after the arrest of several people in connection with an alleged leak of classified documents from his office",

      "bodyText": "The $1m-a-day voter sweepstakes that Elon Musk\u2019s political action committee is hosting in swing states can continue through Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, a Pennsylvania judge ruled on Monday. The common pleas court judge Angelo Foglietta \u2013 ruling after Musk\u2019s lawyers said the winners are not chosen by chance \u2013 did not immediately give a reason for the ruling. The Philadelphia district attorney, Larry Krasner, had called the sweepstakes a scam that violated state election law and asked that it be shut down. Earlier, an attorney for the billionaire told the court that Musk\u2019s pro-Trump group did not choose the winners of its $1m-a-day giveaway to registered voters at random, but instead picked people who would be good spokespeople for its agenda. Musk\u2019s lawyer Chris Gober was trying to persuade the judge that the giveaway was not an \u201cillegal lottery\u201d, as Krasner alleged in a lawsuit seeking to block the contest in advance of Tuesday\u2019s US presidential election. \u201cThere is no prize to be won, instead recipients must fulfill contractual obligations to serve as a spokesperson for the Pac,\u201d Gober said in the hearing before Foglietta. The hearing in the battleground state came just one day before Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will square off in the tightly contested race. Musk and his political action committee are backing the former president, with new figures showing a substantial increase in spending in recent days to at least $169m. Musk\u2019s offer is limited to registered voters in the seven states expected to decide the election: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. America Pac says its two remaining winners will be from Arizona and Michigan, meaning that Musk would probably have been able to continue the giveaway even if Foglietta blocked the lottery. \u201cThe only people protected by Pennsylvania law are in Pennsylvania,\u201d said Richard Briffault, a professor at Columbia Law School. Since 19 October, the Tesla CEO has been giving a $1m check every day to a voter who has signed his petition supporting free speech and gun rights. Musk became an outspoken Trump supporter this year and has promoted Trump on his social media platform, Twitter/X. Krasner, a Democrat, sued Musk and his political action committee in state court on 28 October to try to block the giveaway, which he called an illegal lottery that violates state consumer protection laws. A lawyer for Krasner\u2019s office, John Summers, called Gober\u2019s comments a \u201ccomplete admission of liability\u201d. \u201cWe just heard this guy say, my boss, my client, called this random,\u201d Summers said. \u201cWe promised people that they were going to participate in a random process, but it\u2019s a process where we pre-select people.\u201d Summers later showed the court a clip of Musk at a Trump rally on 19 October telling attendees that America Pac would \u201crandomly\u201d award $1m to people who sign the petition every day until the election. In the video, Musk also said \u201call we ask\u201d is that the winners serve as spokespeople for the group. Krasner took the stand to offer evidence. Under questioning from Summers, he said two Pennsylvania residents had been \u201cscammed for their information\u201d and called the giveaway a \u201cgrift\u201d aimed at political marketing. He said Musk had repeatedly used the word \u201crandomly\u201d to describe the giveaway, and that none of the documents Pennsylvania voters filled out to enter the giveaway mentioned being a spokesperson. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like a spokesperson contract,\u201d Krasner said. Philadelphia is the largest city in Pennsylvania. Whichever candidate wins the state will receive its 19 electoral votes out of a total of 270 needed to win. The giveaway falls in a gray area of election law, and legal experts are divided on whether Musk could be violating federal laws against paying people to register to vote. The US Department of Justice has warned America Pac the giveaway could violate federal law, but federal prosecutors have not taken any public action. Meanwhile, new federal disclosures show that Musk and America Pac have spent $169m so far to support Trump, an increase of almost $40m in a week. The Federal Election Commission\u2019s website shows new expenses for digital media slots either for Trump or against Harris, and that more than half \u2013 $97m \u2013 has been spent on Musk\u2019s troubled canvassing operation. The Trump campaign is broadly reliant on outside groups for canvassing voters, meaning the Super Pac founded by Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, plays an outsized role in what is expected to be a razor-thin election. \u201cBillionaire campaign spending on this scale drowns out the voices and concerns of ordinary Americans,\u201d David Kass, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, said in a statement. \u201cIt is one of the most obvious and disturbing consequences of the growth of billionaire fortunes, as well as being a prime indicator that the system regulating campaign finance has collapsed.\u201d Reuters contributed reporting Read more of the Guardian\u2019s 2024 US election coverage: US election 2024 live updates: latest polls, results and news When do polls close?

Speaking in a college gymnasium, she was preceded by a series of speakers who appealed directly and bluntly to the area\u2019s Puerto Rican population and asked them for their vote.</p> \n<p>\u201cI stand here proud of my longstanding commitment to Puerto Rico and her people and I will be a president for all Americans,\u201d she said. Her Allentown rally was the first of three rallies in Pennsylvania on Monday, the only state she is visiting, underscoring its importance to her campaign.</p> \n<p>Her comments came after almost all of the speakers directly appealed to Puerto Rican voters, highlighting the racist joke a comedian made at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally in which he called Puerto Rico a floating \u201cisland of garbage\u201d.</p> \n<p>Harris did not mention Trump at all by name during her remarks, which lasted just under half an hour.

His peregrinations included the anti-climb panels he ordered to build his border wall, his wife Melania\u2019s bestselling book, Elon Musk\u2019s rocket launches, the grass that was growing on Nasa runways before he came along, and air conditioning and steam baths for dogs.</p> \n<p>Trump denigrated leading Democrats, starting with his presidential rival. He called Harris \u201clow-IQ\u201d and in a bizarre riff imagined her \u201cturning, tossing, sweating\u201d in her sleep.</p> \n<p>He also called Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the US House, \u201ccrazy as a bedbug\u201d, Barack Obama the \u201cgreat divider\u201d, and said he was waiting to \u201chit back\u201d against the former first lady Michelle Obama after she had criticised him.</p> \n<p>But the thrust of his closing argument was focused on immigration, and the supposed 21 million unauthorised migrants \u2013 \u201cmany of them murderers\u201d \u2013 whom he claimed had been let into the US by the Biden administration. Even for a presidential candidate who has centered his campaign in anti-immigrant rhetoric, his closing remarks were dire.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re killing people. They\u2019re killing people at will,\u201d he said, giving gruesome details of specific murders committed by undocumented migrants. \u201cThey just walk right into our country and they kill people.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s Raleigh stop marked his final appearance in North Carolina, a critical battleground state that he needs to win if he is to have a clear shot on returning to the White House. Though Democrats have won the presidential race here only twice since Jimmy Carter in 1976 (the other time being Barack Obama in 2008), Harris is running neck and neck against Trump.</p> \n<p>The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/nov/02/presidential-polls-latest-donald-trump-kamala-harris-election\">poll tracker</a> shows Trump ahead by just one point \u2013 well within the margin of error.</p> \n<p>In tune with the rest of the country, North Carolinians have been voting early in historic numbers. More than 4 million have already cast their ballots, substantially more than in 2020 and 2016, with the party alignment roughly evenly split between Republicans, Democrats and unaffiliated voters.</p> \n<p>As part of his last push to secure victory on election day, Trump repeated the lie that the Biden administration and the federal disaster agency Fema had done nothing to help stricken families in western North Carolina following Hurricane Helene. Even that falsehood was tied to immigration.</p> \n<p>\u201cFema did a horrible job,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe administration, they\u2019re still not there. You know why? Because they\u2019ve spent all their money on bringing in murderers. They spent all their money on bringing in illegal migrants.\u201d</p> \n<p>In fact, Fema\u2019s budget for housing undocumented migrants is ringfenced and has no impact on the agency\u2019s work dealing with disasters.

      "bodyText": "Forecasters posted a hurricane warning in the Caribbean on Monday afternoon after a late-season disturbance south of Cuba strengthened into Tropical Storm Rafael and set its sights on the US Gulf coast. The 17th named storm of an overactive Atlantic hurricane season will bring heavy rain to Jamaica and the Cayman Islands before strengthening to a hurricane and probably hitting Cuba, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. Forecasters are predicting that it will bring heavy rainfall to parts of the US along the Gulf of Mexico, with longer-range projections showing the Louisiana coast, including New Orleans, and Mississippi in the so-called cone of concern. A hurricane warning was in effect for the Cayman Islands, while Cuba was placed under a hurricane watch, and a tropical storm warning was posted for Jamaica. By Monday afternoon, Rafael was about 175 miles (280km) south of Kingston, Jamaica, with maximum sustained winds of 45mph (72km/h), and moving north at 9mph. The storm was expected to move near Jamaica by late Monday and be near or over the Cayman Islands late Tuesday into Wednesday at near hurricane strength. While weather models suggest the center of the storm could eventually make landfall between Louisiana and the western edge of the Florida Panhandle, dry air and water temperatures in the 70s Fahrenheit could cause it to rapidly weaken as it moves north. \u201cIt is too soon to determine what, if any, impacts Rafael could bring to portions of the northern Gulf coast. Residents in this area should regularly monitor updates to the forecast,\u201d the NHC specialist Larry Kelly wrote in an afternoon update. \u201cRafael will bring areas of heavy rain to portions of the western Caribbean, including Jamaica and Cuba through mid-week, where flooding and landslides are possible. Heavy rainfall will spread into Florida and adjacent areas of the south east US mid to late week.\u201d Kelly said totals of 3 to 6in and up to 9in were expected locally in Jamaica and parts of Cuba. Annually, hurricane seasons are expected to last at least through 30 November. Hurricanes forming in the late stages of those seasons have been seen more often during the ongoing climate crisis, spurred primarily by the burning of fossil fuels. Major hurricanes Helene in September, and Milton last month, followed similar paths across the Caribbean and strengthened significantly in the Gulf of Mexico before striking Florida\u2019s west coast.

Betts\u2019 comments came amid ongoing debate about the influence of Qantas on federal decision-making and recent scrutiny about flight upgrades Anthony Albanese received when he was transport minister. Albanese has said he declared all upgraded travel as required. Betts told a Senate estimates hearing that while he has Chairman\u2019s Lounge membership with Qantas, he only has access to Virgin Australia\u2019s standard lounges, not its exclusive Beyond Lounge.

      "bodyText": "Xabi Alonso took centre stage at Anfield elegantly, considered his options and switched play in an instant. Had the ball been at his feet it would have felt as if he had never been away, but it was on the subject of succeeding J\u00fcrgen Klopp as Liverpool manager where the club\u2019s former midfielder showed the deftest of touches. Alonso was back with Bayer Leverkusen, Liverpool\u2019s opponent in the Champions League on Tuesday night, 15 years after ending a playing chapter in his career synonymous with style, Istanbul and an intuitive rapport with Steven Gerrard. He could have been back sooner had Liverpool received any encouragement he might have been in the market for a new job this summer. It was not a possibility he entertained at the time or was keen to revisit at his pre-match press conference on Monday. \u201cAt the time I was focused on a big thing with Leverkusen,\u201d said the man who has transformed the German club\u2019s fortunes and was the popular choice to succeed Klopp earlier this year before Arne Slot took it and hit the ground running. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the game tomorrow, it\u2019s more interesting than my future,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the great players on both sides, that is what is in my head. For us it is a big challenge to come here. Liverpool at the moment is one of the best if not the best in Europe, they are showing that in a very strong Premier League and the Champions League. It\u2019s a good squad, good coach. At Anfield, it\u2019s a big challenge.\u201d One benefit of Klopp informing the Liverpool hierarchy of his decision to quit last November was the time it afforded them to sound out potential successors. Liverpool were informed early in their search that Alonso had no plans to leave Leverkusen at the end of the 2023-24 season. Due diligence started privately on Feyenoord\u2019s Slot instead.

I know people expect us to win all 38 games 5-0 [in the league] and win the treble every season, because this is our standard, but it will not happen.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s more difficult because we have a lot of [injury] absences. To win the treble everything has to be on the same page \u2013 no injuries, good momentum, opponents drop points at the right time. This is not possible because Oscar [Bobb] was the best player in pre-season and we miss him a lot. Jack [Grealish] is still not fit and Rodri, the best player in the world, is not here for the rest of the season.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that we are going to struggle and that is the point. Accept that we are going to struggle and it is fine. Maybe we will lose against Brighton and Tottenham [in the league] but we lost one game and we are two points behind a top-class team in Liverpool. We have done decently in the Champions League. Every team is now more difficult but this is the challenge. Be there and at the end we will see if we can arrive in the last month with the chance to fight for the titles.</p> <p>\u201cThe players know it because they feel it in the last month or two the quality of the teams. That\u2019s why I\u2019m really impressed and really happy that we are still there. Bournemouth deserved to win by far. That doesn\u2019t mean we are bad, we are not going to fight for the titles. When you lose sometimes, the opponents can be better.\u201d</p> <p>R\u00faben Dias and John Stones are also missing for City\u2019s fourth Champions League game, at Sporting, with Guardiola\u2019s side on seven points. Erling Haaland appeared to take a knock in training on Monday before the squad flew to Lisbon.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine, no problem. We have to occupy the news 24 hours. That\u2019s the reason why,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cI don\u2019t think [he needs a rest] \u2013 maybe international break [starting next week].\u201d</p> <p>Savinho, Nathan Ak\u00e9, Kevin De Bruyne, Manuel Akanji and J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku have also travelled despite not being 100% fit. Guardiola said: \u201cManu and Nathan are still having problems, Kevin is getting better, having sessions with less pain so we feel that he feels more comfortable. Doku has had a little problems with muscular issues, Savinho is getting better with his ankle.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Pep Guardiola has said Manchester City must accept that their title defence will be a \u201cstruggle and this is fine\u201d. The champions\u2019 2-1 defeat at Bournemouth last Saturday followed their Carabao Cup elimination by Tottenham. Guardiola was asked if the consecutive reverses are merely a blip or a deeper concern. \u201cIt was in different competitions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe lost one game [in each] and we have to come back to winning games but we are early in November so many things are going to happen. I know people expect us to win all 38 games 5-0 [in the league] and win the treble every season, because this is our standard, but it will not happen. \u201cIt\u2019s more difficult because we have a lot of [injury] absences. To win the treble everything has to be on the same page \u2013 no injuries, good momentum, opponents drop points at the right time. This is not possible because Oscar [Bobb] was the best player in pre-season and we miss him a lot. Jack [Grealish] is still not fit and Rodri, the best player in the world, is not here for the rest of the season. \u201cWe know that we are going to struggle and that is the point. Accept that we are going to struggle and it is fine. Maybe we will lose against Brighton and Tottenham [in the league] but we lost one game and we are two points behind a top-class team in Liverpool. We have done decently in the Champions League. Every team is now more difficult but this is the challenge. Be there and at the end we will see if we can arrive in the last month with the chance to fight for the titles. \u201cThe players know it because they feel it in the last month or two the quality of the teams. That\u2019s why I\u2019m really impressed and really happy that we are still there. Bournemouth deserved to win by far. That doesn\u2019t mean we are bad, we are not going to fight for the titles. When you lose sometimes, the opponents can be better.\u201d R\u00faben Dias and John Stones are also missing for City\u2019s fourth Champions League game, at Sporting, with Guardiola\u2019s side on seven points. Erling Haaland appeared to take a knock in training on Monday before the squad flew to Lisbon. \u201cHe\u2019s fine, no problem. We have to occupy the news 24 hours. That\u2019s the reason why,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cI don\u2019t think [he needs a rest] \u2013 maybe international break [starting next week].\u201d Savinho, Nathan Ak\u00e9, Kevin De Bruyne, Manuel Akanji and J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku have also travelled despite not being 100% fit. Guardiola said: \u201cManu and Nathan are still having problems, Kevin is getting better, having sessions with less pain so we feel that he feels more comfortable. Doku has had a little problems with muscular issues, Savinho is getting better with his ankle.\u201d",

On 15 October, Georgia\u2019s first day of early voting, the state \u201cshattered records\u201d, <a href=\"https://x.com/GaSecofState/status/1846367394924568856\">according to</a> the secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger. By 23 October, <a href=\"https://election.lab.ufl.edu/early-vote/2024-early-voting/\">more than</a> 1.9 million people had cast a ballot there in-person or by mail. And in North Carolina, which had been devastated by Hurricane Helene just weeks earlier, more than 353,000 voters turned out to cast a ballot early on 18 October \u2013 another state record. By 23 October, more than 1.7 million had voted in the election.</p> <p>Voting early in-person or absentee allows voters some flexibility in their schedule \u2013 by casting a ballot early, they can avoid contending with bad weather, long lines or unexpected scheduling conflicts on election day.</p>  <h2>What is early voting?</h2>  <p>States \u2013 with the exception of Mississippi, New Hampshire and Alabama \u2013 offer all voters the opportunity to cast a ballot in person at a polling place ahead of election day, <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/early-in-person-voting\">according to</a> the National Conference of State Legislatures.&nbsp;<br><br>In those places, registered voters can head to their polling location within the early voting time frame and cast a ballot early. Most states begin counting those ballots on election day, and some require officials to wait until polls are closed to begin counting.&nbsp;</p> <p>Some states offer a version of early voting called \u201cin-person absentee\u201d voting, in which a voter can obtain and submit an absentee ballot in person at a polling place before election day.</p> <h2>What about absentee voting?</h2>  <p>Most states allow for some form of absentee voting, in which a voter requests a ballot ahead of time, which officials then send to them in the mail to fill out and return by mail. Some jurisdictions offer voters the option of returning absentee ballots to a secured dropbox. <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/table-2-excuses-to-vote-absentee\">Fourteen states</a> require an excuse for voters to cast a ballot by mail, such as an illness or work scheduling conflict. Eight states practice \u201call-mail\u201d elections \u2013 in those places, all registered voters receive a ballot in the mail, whether or not they plan to use it.</p> <p>Federal law requires states to send absentee ballots to military voters and voters overseas.</p> <p>States regulate the \u201cprocessing\u201d and counting of absentee ballots; most states allow officials to immediately process ballots, which typically entails verifying the signature on the ballot with the voter\u2019s signature from when they registered to vote. Other states require officials to wait until election day to begin processing ballots \u2013 which can slow the release of election results.</p> <h2>When does early and absentee voting start this year, and how do I do it?</h2>  <p>The first ballots of the general election have already been sent to voters in states including Wisconsin and Maryland, and to some eligible voters in Alabama. Mail voting has stalled in North Carolina, where a legal battle over whether or not Robert F Kennedy Jr can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/01/rfk-jr-sues-north-carolina-elections-board-over-ballot\">appear on the ballot</a> has slowed the process.

      "bodyText": "The US election is under way across the country, and so far more than 80 million people have voted early, according to the University of Florida\u2019s election lab. In numerous states, the push to vote before election day, whether by mail or in-person, has amounted to an unprecedented wave of early voting. More than 97,000 voted on Wisconsin\u2019s first day of early, in-person voting \u2013 an \u201cunheard of\u201d level of turnout, wrote the state elections commissioner, Ann Jacobs, on Twitter/X. On 15 October, Georgia\u2019s first day of early voting, the state \u201cshattered records\u201d, according to the secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger. By 23 October, more than 1.9 million people had cast a ballot there in-person or by mail. And in North Carolina, which had been devastated by Hurricane Helene just weeks earlier, more than 353,000 voters turned out to cast a ballot early on 18 October \u2013 another state record. By 23 October, more than 1.7 million had voted in the election. Voting early in-person or absentee allows voters some flexibility in their schedule \u2013 by casting a ballot early, they can avoid contending with bad weather, long lines or unexpected scheduling conflicts on election day. What is early voting? States \u2013 with the exception of Mississippi, New Hampshire and Alabama \u2013 offer all voters the opportunity to cast a ballot in person at a polling place ahead of election day, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In those places, registered voters can head to their polling location within the early voting time frame and cast a ballot early. Most states begin counting those ballots on election day, and some require officials to wait until polls are closed to begin counting. Some states offer a version of early voting called \u201cin-person absentee\u201d voting, in which a voter can obtain and submit an absentee ballot in person at a polling place before election day. What about absentee voting? Most states allow for some form of absentee voting, in which a voter requests a ballot ahead of time, which officials then send to them in the mail to fill out and return by mail. Some jurisdictions offer voters the option of returning absentee ballots to a secured dropbox. Fourteen states require an excuse for voters to cast a ballot by mail, such as an illness or work scheduling conflict. Eight states practice \u201call-mail\u201d elections \u2013 in those places, all registered voters receive a ballot in the mail, whether or not they plan to use it. Federal law requires states to send absentee ballots to military voters and voters overseas. States regulate the \u201cprocessing\u201d and counting of absentee ballots; most states allow officials to immediately process ballots, which typically entails verifying the signature on the ballot with the voter\u2019s signature from when they registered to vote. Other states require officials to wait until election day to begin processing ballots \u2013 which can slow the release of election results. When does early and absentee voting start this year, and how do I do it? The first ballots of the general election have already been sent to voters in states including Wisconsin and Maryland, and to some eligible voters in Alabama. Mail voting has stalled in North Carolina, where a legal battle over whether or not Robert F Kennedy Jr can appear on the ballot has slowed the process. By 21 September, election officials in many states will have begun sending out absentee ballots. The specific dates, locations and rules surrounding early and absentee voting vary by state, county and even municipality. First confirm that you are registered to vote and then contact your local election office or check their website for details about early and absentee voting. Who votes early and by mail, and does it benefit one party over the other? Research suggests that before 2020, implementing voting by mail did not benefit one party more than another. But in 2020, with the pandemic raging, Democrats urged people to vote by mail to avoid exposure to Covid, and fought legal battles to expand absentee voting in states where the practice had not already been widely adopted. Meanwhile, in the months ahead of the election, Donald Trump claimed falsely that the process was rife with fraud, probably scaring Republican voters away from the remote option. In the end, Democrats saw gains during the 2020 general election in counties that used mail-in voting, according to data from the Guardian and ProPublica. In the wake of the 2022 midterm elections, when Democrats outperformed expectations and maintained control of the Senate, Republicans began to reverse course on voting early \u2013 and have continued to advocate for voters to embrace the process since then. The reversal appears to have had an impact: in the swing states of Arizona and Nevada, Republicans had outpaced Democrats slightly in early voting turnout by 23 October, according to data collected by the Associated Press. Is it safe to vote by mail? Mail voting is considered extremely secure in the US, and instances of fraud in mail voting are vanishingly rare. In a 2020 column, the elections expert Rick Hasen noted that between 2000 and 2012, there were fewer than 500 examples of vote-by-mail fraud, out of billions of votes cast. (As the Brennan Center for Justice notes, this makes mail-in voting fraud less likely than being struck by lightning). While mail-in voting fraud is extremely rare, election officials across the country have raised concerns about postal delays that could result in eligible voters\u2019 ballots reaching election clerks after the deadline to count their ballots.",

These were accolades earned with a performance in the rain that stands as one of the best of his career and worthy of recognition in the pantheon of Formula One\u2019s wet weather drives.</p> <p>Before the race at Interlagos, damage limitation had been perhaps the best expectation but when the flag fell with Verstappen in front and his title rival, Lando Norris, in sixth, he had not only taken a famous victory but also just about sealed the world championship.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/04/max-verstappen-hits-back-british-critics-sao-paulo-gp-masterclass-f1\">Max Verstappen hits back at British critics after S\u00e3o Paulo GP masterclass</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He had produced a flawless piece of driving in treacherous conditions that caught out a number of his competitors, leaving them flailing over the glassy surface while Verstappen enjoyed a control of his car that looked preternatural.</p> <p>The start was vital as he moved from 17th to 11th on the opening lap but he then executed a series of outstanding passes, almost all late-braking at turn one. These manoeuvres were crowned when he scythed up the inside of Esteban Ocon for the lead on a restart, leaving the Frenchman a little in awe of how Verstappen was able to brake so late and maintain control of his car in such conditions.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Verstappen\u2019s Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, was unstinting in his praise. He compared his performance to that of Ayrton Senna at Donington in 1993 when the Brazilian produced a drive in horrendous conditions that set him apart from the rest after an opening lap when he thrust his way into the lead and was untouchable.</p> <p>\u201cToday was an emotional rollercoaster,\u201d Horner said. \u201cMax\u2019s mental strength and attitude to deal with that is outstanding and his start was electric. That first lap was up there with Donington 93. I think he passed six cars on the first lap.\u201d</p>    <p>Such judgments are subjective. Senna rated his drive in the wet at Estoril in the Portuguese GP in 1985 as a better performance than that at Donington. There he lapped the entire field, bar Michele Alboreto\u2019s Ferrari and finished a minute ahead of him, in conditions that would have stopped the race today.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/03/i-never-thought-id-win-verstappen-after-shock-brazil-gp-triumph-from-17th\">\u2018I never thought I\u2019d win\u2019: Verstappen after shock Brazil GP triumph from 17th</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other races in the modern era stand out, Lewis Hamilton\u2019s victory at Silverstone in 2008, Sebastian Vettel the same year at Monza, Jenson Button\u2019s run to victory from last at Canada in 2011 and Verstappen\u2019s charge from 16th to third at Brazil in 2016. These are performances matched across the decades, with Jim Clark at Spa in 1963 and Sir Jackie Stewart at the N\u00fcrburgring in 1968 springing instantly to mind.</p> <p>Comparisons, especially across eras are almost impossible and equally subjective but Clark\u2019s victory demonstrates how high the bar is for bravura performances in the wet. His win in Belgium on the old, fearsome 8.8-mile Spa circuit where he had seen close friends killed and he did not like driving, remains outstanding.</p> <p>Clark shot from eighth to the lead off the start having veered to the right into the pit lane \u2013 an open apron in front of the garages then \u2013 and set off at great pace, while driving with a gearbox problem. The car was jumping out of fifth and Clark was forced to drive one-handed with his left hand so he could hold the gear lever in place with his right. Then the rain came.</p>    <p>The circuit was swiftly awash and as cars fell off all around him, Clark maintained a magisterial control. He took the flag having lapped the entire field, with the exception of Bruce McLaren in second, almost five minutes back, and six cars of 20 finished. Clark did not complete a slow-down lap but simply parked on the finish line, climbed exhausted and soaked to the skin from his car and walked to the Lotus garage, utterly spent.</p> <p>Verstappen counted his win on Sunday as the better race over 2016 because then he was not in a championship fight and had nothing to lose. That context does matter but equally his touch this time was that of a driver at his very peak.</p> <p>This was not only demonstrated in his pace and control but, as Ocon said, in that ability to make passes. His car had as much propensity to lock-up as any other but his sublime touch to brake late and manage to turn in without doing so \u2013 a balancing act of extraordinary precision \u2013 was the differential and raised his drive to another level. As McLaren\u2019s Oscar Piastri observed almost with incredulity: \u201cHe seemed to be pretty much the only one that could overtake\u201d.</p>    <p>Yes, the good fortune of the red flag that allowed him a free change of tyres played its part.

      "bodyText": "In the wake of Max Verstappen\u2019s victory at the S\u00e3o Paulo Grand Prix from 17th place on Sunday, superlatives lay strewn at his feet like so many battle banners of conquest. These were accolades earned with a performance in the rain that stands as one of the best of his career and worthy of recognition in the pantheon of Formula One\u2019s wet weather drives. Before the race at Interlagos, damage limitation had been perhaps the best expectation but when the flag fell with Verstappen in front and his title rival, Lando Norris, in sixth, he had not only taken a famous victory but also just about sealed the world championship. He had produced a flawless piece of driving in treacherous conditions that caught out a number of his competitors, leaving them flailing over the glassy surface while Verstappen enjoyed a control of his car that looked preternatural. The start was vital as he moved from 17th to 11th on the opening lap but he then executed a series of outstanding passes, almost all late-braking at turn one. These manoeuvres were crowned when he scythed up the inside of Esteban Ocon for the lead on a restart, leaving the Frenchman a little in awe of how Verstappen was able to brake so late and maintain control of his car in such conditions. Unsurprisingly, Verstappen\u2019s Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, was unstinting in his praise. He compared his performance to that of Ayrton Senna at Donington in 1993 when the Brazilian produced a drive in horrendous conditions that set him apart from the rest after an opening lap when he thrust his way into the lead and was untouchable. \u201cToday was an emotional rollercoaster,\u201d Horner said. \u201cMax\u2019s mental strength and attitude to deal with that is outstanding and his start was electric. That first lap was up there with Donington 93. I think he passed six cars on the first lap.\u201d Such judgments are subjective. Senna rated his drive in the wet at Estoril in the Portuguese GP in 1985 as a better performance than that at Donington. There he lapped the entire field, bar Michele Alboreto\u2019s Ferrari and finished a minute ahead of him, in conditions that would have stopped the race today. Other races in the modern era stand out, Lewis Hamilton\u2019s victory at Silverstone in 2008, Sebastian Vettel the same year at Monza, Jenson Button\u2019s run to victory from last at Canada in 2011 and Verstappen\u2019s charge from 16th to third at Brazil in 2016. These are performances matched across the decades, with Jim Clark at Spa in 1963 and Sir Jackie Stewart at the N\u00fcrburgring in 1968 springing instantly to mind. Comparisons, especially across eras are almost impossible and equally subjective but Clark\u2019s victory demonstrates how high the bar is for bravura performances in the wet. His win in Belgium on the old, fearsome 8.8-mile Spa circuit where he had seen close friends killed and he did not like driving, remains outstanding. Clark shot from eighth to the lead off the start having veered to the right into the pit lane \u2013 an open apron in front of the garages then \u2013 and set off at great pace, while driving with a gearbox problem. The car was jumping out of fifth and Clark was forced to drive one-handed with his left hand so he could hold the gear lever in place with his right. Then the rain came. The circuit was swiftly awash and as cars fell off all around him, Clark maintained a magisterial control. He took the flag having lapped the entire field, with the exception of Bruce McLaren in second, almost five minutes back, and six cars of 20 finished. Clark did not complete a slow-down lap but simply parked on the finish line, climbed exhausted and soaked to the skin from his car and walked to the Lotus garage, utterly spent. Verstappen counted his win on Sunday as the better race over 2016 because then he was not in a championship fight and had nothing to lose. That context does matter but equally his touch this time was that of a driver at his very peak. This was not only demonstrated in his pace and control but, as Ocon said, in that ability to make passes. His car had as much propensity to lock-up as any other but his sublime touch to brake late and manage to turn in without doing so \u2013 a balancing act of extraordinary precision \u2013 was the differential and raised his drive to another level. As McLaren\u2019s Oscar Piastri observed almost with incredulity: \u201cHe seemed to be pretty much the only one that could overtake\u201d. Yes, the good fortune of the red flag that allowed him a free change of tyres played its part. It should also be noted that the field is not a thriving competitive cauldron; only three teams are really in the mix at the front and in the rain the Red Bull was unquestionably the quickest car. As Norris said, if Verstappen had started at the front he probably would have lapped the McLaren. None of which is to do Verstappen a disservice. He still had to pull it off, he still had to execute through the field without putting a wheel wrong. He did so brilliantly for a deserved place among F1\u2019s celebrated regenmeisters.",

Houghton won 121 caps for England, and captained her country from 2014 to 2021, but her most significant achievements happened far from the pitch.

She also reflects on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/27/lionesses-legend-steph-houghton-to-retire-at-the-end-of-the-season\">painful end to her career</a> and her belief that she was treated poorly by Sarina Wiegman. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve come from nothing and you don\u2019t expect anything, to go into meetings with people that are very experienced is a difficult job,\u201d Houghton writes in <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/leading-from-the-back-9781408734377/\">her autobiography</a> which charts her early life in the north east before documenting her crucial role in helping to change perceptions of women\u2019s football. \u201cThe FA [Football Association] had so much control over our money and income \u2026 we couldn\u2019t go: \u2018Just fucking give us more money\u2019, even though it was really tempting to do that because it was ridiculous what the lads were getting compared to us.\u201d</p> <p>Houghton insists she does not like confrontation and is not \u201coutspoken, or particularly brave\u201d, but gross inequality forced her to take action. She reveals that, 12 years ago when she was already the best female centre\u2011back in the country, her contract at Arsenal was pitiful. Houghton was paid an annual wage of \u00a34,000 which, if her bonuses and extra work as a part\u2011time coach and&nbsp;club ambassador came in, could rise to \u00a39,000.</p> <p>\u201cI put them figures in the book because I wanted people to know where we\u2019ve come from and where we are now,\u201d Houghton says. \u201cArsenal was the best club in England and that was their level. Money was never really a driver for me. It was just about playing for Arsenal and winning trophies, but when you meet people that have got a lot more experience about what you should be earning, that\u2019s when you think: \u2018Right, things have&nbsp;to change.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Houghton gives credit to Matthew Buck, who is her agent and began advising her when he worked for the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association. Like everyone at Arsenal in 2012, Houghton signed each new contract which was handed to her. She didn\u2019t appreciate that she had the right to seek advice on the offer,&nbsp;and to reject it.</p> <p>After she shocked Arsenal by insisting she wanted Buck to negotiate an improved deal, and eventually joined Manchester City in 2014, with her growing knowledge of the football business Houghton turned her attention to the international game. She describes herself as \u201cthe mainstay\u201d of a leadership group including Casey Stoney, Laura Bassett, Jordan Nobbs and Lucy Bronze.</p>    <p>\u201cWhen I looked at what [England\u2019s men] were getting for commercial deals that really opened my eyes,\u201d Houghton says. \u201cThe men and women play for the national teams of the same country and yet they\u2019re getting 15 times more than us. How is that fair? I got the bit between my teeth and I was like: \u2018OK, we need to do something about that.\u2019 That\u2019s what I\u2019m probably most proud of in terms of the stuff that we did off the pitch \u2013 to change how companies thought of us as athletes and to stop them taking the piss.\u201d</p> <p>It took years of \u201cbanging your head against the wall\u201d but Houghton and her group also finally cracked the FA. Until then, contracts had been skewed so badly that, according to Houghton, \u201cit was 98% the FA and 2% the players \u2013 but the players felt they were privileged to have a contract at all, so they just took the money\u201d. She adds: \u201cThe fight for World Cup bonuses was a key moment. We were going into World Cups with no [financial] incentive, no chance of getting any prize money whatsoever. But we ended up coming away with a biggish bonus for the World Cup in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/04/germany-england-womens-world-cup-third-place-match-report\">when England finished third</a>]. For girls who could never put down a deposit on a house, it was life\u2011changing. That set&nbsp;the precedent. It became a normal conversation that we would sort the bonuses out well in advance of the tournament.\u201d</p> <p>Did Houghton visualise the current state of the women\u2019s game which, over the past few years, has been transformed in terms of exposure and economics? \u201cIt was the ideal plan but I didn\u2019t know how many years it would take. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly happened quicker than we ever imagined. We knew we wanted to play in big stadiums and make it accessible for people to&nbsp;come and watch the national team. We knew from a contract situation that we wanted girls to feel secure and be paid fairly as an England player and reward them for being the best in the country. We\u2019ve certainly escalated it a lot quicker \u2013 but we can make it even better.\u201d</p>    <p>It is a source of deep sporting pain for Houghton that she missed the euphoria of playing for, and captaining, England when they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jul/31/england-win-germany-euro-2022-only-beginning-for-women-game\">won the European Championship on home soil</a> in 2022. A torn achilles ruined her long run in the team and, while she worked hard to make the initial squad of 30, Houghton was one of the unlucky few to be cut from final selection.</p> <p>There was more hurt the following year when, while told by Wiegman to keep working, she was left out of the World Cup squad. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/20/spain-england-womens-world-cup-final-match-report\">England reached the final</a> but Houghton\u2019s international career had come to a sad end. She felt abandoned by England and let down by Wiegman who, Houghton says, showed little empathy or consistency towards her. \u201cI was disappointed with the whole situation from the start to finish,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen the goalposts keep changing, it\u2019s hard as a player to really believe in anything and trust that situation. It seemed like no matter what [Wiegman] said I had to do, and after I did that, it was never going to happen.</p> <p>\u201cIf I was to ever go into management or coaching, I would always have a people-first approach. It\u2019s important to be honest, but also to respect what a player has achieved. I would never like anybody to feel the way that I felt in that two-year period.</p>    <p>\u201cI like to think if that was me in a scenario where I\u2019d let go of a player who had done a lot over the past [14] years with the nation, I\u2019d have those difficult conversations with her. It\u2019s starting to go down that men\u2019s football route in the sense that you are a number, and that human touch wasn\u2019t there. So I felt let down as they could have done things a little bit different.\u201d</p> <p>That disappointment fades when set against the suffering her husband <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@bbcsport/video/7321758571035708704?lang=en\">endures on a daily basis</a>. MND is a harrowing disease which can rob a person of all movement and speech and make it difficult to swallow. Darby has deteriorated in recent months and he has had to undergo a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, which implants a feeding tube to give his body the nutrients and sustenance it needs to survive.</p> <p>\u201cYou want Stephen to be living a normal life as much as possible, to be able to eat as much food as he can and get that calorie intake on board,\u201d Houghton says.</p> <p>\u201cOver the last few months it became a bit risky having food and that\u2019s when the decision had to be made. We need Stephen to keep weight on and to eat. It hasn\u2019t been a great few months because these decisions are life-changing and it takes a lot of time to get used to. But ultimately it\u2019s the best thing for him. It allows him to relax a bit more.</p> <p>\u201cThere are good and bad days but I think we\u2019ve adapted really well over the last six years. It\u2019s obviously a tough ride but I want to be honest about the actual process and spread awareness of the disease. It\u2019s so important we discuss the reality of MND so we can potentially help people in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Houghton admits: \u201cIn the first few years it was so hard to take in. You don\u2019t want to believe it because you\u2019re like: \u2018Why us? We\u2019re only young and Stephen should still be playing football. It\u2019s not fair.\u2019 But the more you dwell on it, the more that it harms you. So I\u2019ve learnt how important it is to be positive.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/01/charlton-women-ellie-brazil-acl-injuries-interview\">Charlton\u2019s Ellie Brazil: \u2018With my second ACL injury, it was instant fear\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Darby encouraged Houghton to keep playing football after his diagnosis. \u201cThat shows how unselfish he is because he easily could have said: \u2018I need you here all the time.\u2019 I would have done it in a heartbeat. But he knew how much football meant to us and my career was not over. Even since I\u2019ve retired he\u2019s just so supportive.

So it was always in our plans that, as soon as I stopped football, we would potentially try.\u201d Houghton looks up as a tangled smile crosses her face. \u201cBut life gets in the way sometimes, doesn\u2019t it? We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d</p> <p>Houghton is \u201cbusier than ever\u201d as, while caring for her husband, she is \u201cvery grateful that I\u2019ve done work at Sky and I have my Man City ambassador role, coaching and a podcast [on women\u2019s football] with Ian Wright.

You just want it to be OK but I think we\u2019re getting into more of a routine. Our families have been absolutely unreal as we\u2019ve got such a good support network.

She adds: \u201cThe fight for World Cup bonuses was a key moment. We were going into World Cups with no [financial] incentive, no chance of getting any prize money whatsoever. But we ended up coming away with a biggish bonus for the World Cup in 2015 [when England finished third]. For girls who could never put down a deposit on a house, it was life\u2011changing. That set the precedent. It became a normal conversation that we would sort the bonuses out well in advance of the tournament.\u201d Did Houghton visualise the current state of the women\u2019s game which, over the past few years, has been transformed in terms of exposure and economics? \u201cIt was the ideal plan but I didn\u2019t know how many years it would take. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly happened quicker than we ever imagined. We knew we wanted to play in big stadiums and make it accessible for people to come and watch the national team. We knew from a contract situation that we wanted girls to feel secure and be paid fairly as an England player and reward them for being the best in the country. We\u2019ve certainly escalated it a lot quicker \u2013 but we can make it even better.\u201d It is a source of deep sporting pain for Houghton that she missed the euphoria of playing for, and captaining, England when they won the European Championship on home soil in 2022. A torn achilles ruined her long run in the team and, while she worked hard to make the initial squad of 30, Houghton was one of the unlucky few to be cut from final selection. There was more hurt the following year when, while told by Wiegman to keep working, she was left out of the World Cup squad. England reached the final but Houghton\u2019s international career had come to a sad end. She felt abandoned by England and let down by Wiegman who, Houghton says, showed little empathy or consistency towards her. \u201cI was disappointed with the whole situation from the start to finish,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen the goalposts keep changing, it\u2019s hard as a player to really believe in anything and trust that situation. It seemed like no matter what [Wiegman] said I had to do, and after I did that, it was never going to happen. \u201cIf I was to ever go into management or coaching, I would always have a people-first approach. It\u2019s important to be honest, but also to respect what a player has achieved. I would never like anybody to feel the way that I felt in that two-year period. \u201cI like to think if that was me in a scenario where I\u2019d let go of a player who had done a lot over the past [14] years with the nation, I\u2019d have those difficult conversations with her. It\u2019s starting to go down that men\u2019s football route in the sense that you are a number, and that human touch wasn\u2019t there. So I felt let down as they could have done things a little bit different.\u201d That disappointment fades when set against the suffering her husband endures on a daily basis. MND is a harrowing disease which can rob a person of all movement and speech and make it difficult to swallow. Darby has deteriorated in recent months and he has had to undergo a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, which implants a feeding tube to give his body the nutrients and sustenance it needs to survive. \u201cYou want Stephen to be living a normal life as much as possible, to be able to eat as much food as he can and get that calorie intake on board,\u201d Houghton says. \u201cOver the last few months it became a bit risky having food and that\u2019s when the decision had to be made. We need Stephen to keep weight on and to eat. It hasn\u2019t been a great few months because these decisions are life-changing and it takes a lot of time to get used to. But ultimately it\u2019s the best thing for him. It allows him to relax a bit more. \u201cThere are good and bad days but I think we\u2019ve adapted really well over the last six years. It\u2019s obviously a tough ride but I want to be honest about the actual process and spread awareness of the disease. It\u2019s so important we discuss the reality of MND so we can potentially help people in the future.\u201d Houghton admits: \u201cIn the first few years it was so hard to take in. You don\u2019t want to believe it because you\u2019re like: \u2018Why us? We\u2019re only young and Stephen should still be playing football. It\u2019s not fair.\u2019 But the more you dwell on it, the more that it harms you. So I\u2019ve learnt how important it is to be positive.\u201d Darby encouraged Houghton to keep playing football after his diagnosis. \u201cThat shows how unselfish he is because he easily could have said: \u2018I need you here all the time.\u2019 I would have done it in a heartbeat. But he knew how much football meant to us and my career was not over. Even since I\u2019ve retired he\u2019s just so supportive. We make joint decisions so that we can move forward with my work and his foundation.\u201d They have long considered starting a family and Houghton says: \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a mam, and Steve\u2019s always wanted to be a dad. So it was always in our plans that, as soon as I stopped football, we would potentially try.\u201d Houghton looks up as a tangled smile crosses her face. \u201cBut life gets in the way sometimes, doesn\u2019t it? We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Houghton is \u201cbusier than ever\u201d as, while caring for her husband, she is \u201cvery grateful that I\u2019ve done work at Sky and I have my Man City ambassador role, coaching and a podcast [on women\u2019s football] with Ian Wright. When I\u2019m going to games or having to stay overnight I feel a little guilty because I\u2019m not with Stephen.It takes a lot out of you emotionally\u201d. \u201cThese last few months have been challenging because you always have that worry in the back of your head if you\u2019re not there and something happens. You just want it to be OK but I think we\u2019re getting into more of a routine. Our families have been absolutely unreal as we\u2019ve got such a good support network. It allows me to do what I need to do and for Stephen to have the best possible care.\u201d Steph Houghton\u2019s Leading from the Back is published by Sphere.",

Despite having a tiny gene pool of talent from which to choose and the best part of a month to make up her mind \u2013 she had been the odds on favourite ever since it became a straight fight with Robert Jenrick \u2013 KemiKaze has struggled to fill her ministerial slots.

Hardly what you might call hitting the ground running.</p> <p>First to get appointed was Laura Trott as shadow education secretary. Mainly because Kemi had to have a shadow minister to send out for education departmental questions on Monday afternoon. A disappointment for Trott, as she had been hoping for shadow chancellor. There again maybe KemiKaze remembered her abject BBC interview with Evan Davis earlier in the year when she had no idea that government debt was rising. Even though she was Treasury No 2 at the time. Clearly numbers are not her strong point. Though no one knows what is.</p> <p>Mel Stride got the shadow chancellor brief. On the surface, an embrace of the left of the party and a thank you for hours spent defending the last government on TV and radio when no one else would. But Mel isn\u2019t quite as sweet as he looks. He had it in for maternity pay long before Badenoch got the idea.</p> <p>Rather more disturbing was Priti Patel as shadow foreign secretary.

If that wasn\u2019t enough, she was the architect of the disastrous Rwanda policy. But somehow KemiKaze looks on all these failures as advantages. She sees Priti as a woman with a future.

The 64 people, including 16 children, have been stranded on the island since October 2021, when a fishing boat they were using to flee persecution in Sri Lanka got into difficulties. The commissioner on the British Indian Ocean Territory argued that they could be lawfully returned to Sri Lanka, but the refugees fought the decision in the courts. On Monday, the high court heard that the UK government had dropped its opposition to the group\u2019s case and that they would be permitted to travel to the UK. The majority of the group are still on the island but eight have been sent to Rwanda for medical treatment unavailable on Diego Garcia. Those in Rwanda are to be brought to the UK as well. The only exceptions the UK government has made relate to three Tamils who have criminal convictions. Their fate is unclear. In a letter from the government legal department disclosed in the high court, officials confirmed that the government would bring the vast majority of people on the island to the UK, subject to entry clearance applications being submitted, biometrics being enrolled and no adverse information arising out of these checks. An offer was recently made to some of the Tamils on the island to send them to Romania for six months, with a view to them later moving to the UK. Monday\u2019s offer cancels the earlier one.

      "bodyText": "Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum has accused the country\u2019s supreme court of overstepping its functions and \u201ctrying to change what the people of Mexico decided\u201d as it prepares to discuss whether to strike down parts of a transformative judicial reform. The court is expected to vote on Tuesday whether the controversial reform violates other parts of the constitution, setting up a showdown with Sheinbaum barely a month into her government. The move would shift Mexico to a system where almost all of its judges, including the supreme court, are elected by popular vote. No other country in the world has such a system. The US elects judges at the lower level, while Bolivia elects 26 judges across its top courts. But in Mexico, thousands of positions at all levels would be put to the vote. Proponents say the reform is needed to root out corruption in the judicial system. Opponents say it will do little to address corruption, but will hand the ruling Morena party control of the courts, while giving organised crime groups another chance to impose their candidates in elections. \u201cIt has to be made very clear that eight justices cannot be above the people,\u201d Sheinbaum told reporters on Monday. Morena already has a level of political power not seen for decades in Mexico, after its landslide election victory in June gave it a supermajority in Congress and control of enough state legislatures to change the constitution at will. It has passed a whirl of amendments since, including the judicial reform in September. The judicial system itself has come out strongly against the reform, with strikes and protests. Though three members of the supreme court have said they support the reform, the other eight showed their resistance by declaring they would not run in the elections scheduled for August 2025. Now the court will discuss whether the judicial reform violates existing precepts in the constitution in a last-ditch effort to stop it moving forwards. This has already prompted the legislative to pass another amendment last week that blocks the court from reviewing legal challenges to any constitutional reforms, potentially nullifying any decision that the court takes. That means if the supreme court does vote against the judicial reform, Mexico will be in uncharted territory. And Sheinbaum will have to decide whether to ignore or comply with the ruling. \u201cThis will lead to a constitutional crisis of a kind we have not seen for the duration of the 1917 constitution,\u201d Olvera Rangel told Proceso, a Mexican magazine. The dispute has dominated the agenda during Sheinbaum\u2019s first month in government, sucking attention away from other issues such as the expansion of social programs, the further militarisation of public security, and the rising violence in states such as Sinaloa and Chiapas. It has also spooked markets, leading the peso to depreciate more than 15% against the dollar, and drawn rare public criticism from the US, Mexico\u2019s largest trade partner, which said it jeopardised democracy and rule of the law in the country. To defuse the crisis, one supreme court judge, Juan Luis Gonz\u00e1lez Alc\u00e1ntara, has suggested a compromise: that the top courts stand for election, but the thousands of other judges do not. But it is unclear whether the other judges on the supreme court would agree to this, let alone Sheinbaum and her party. Sheinbaum inherited the judicial reform from former president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who founded Morena and was frustrated when the courts blocked some of his key policies. Even if Sheinbaum was inclined to negotiate with the supreme court, she could face resistance from power brokers within Morena. In any case, she has showed no signs of backing down, accusing the court of being a political actor and violating the constitution itself. On Monday she added that her government has a plan in case the court goes against the judicial reform: \u201cWe are prepared, whichever way they vote.\u201d",

Estimates have suggested fees could go up to as much as \u00a310,500 for students beginning university in 2029 if increases continue to be index-linked.</p> <p>Making the announcement in the Commons, Phillipson told MPs: \u201cIt is no use keeping tuition fees down for future students if the universities are not there for them to attend, nor if students can\u2019t afford to support themselves while they study.\u201d</p> <p>The increase to tuition fees will have been a particularly hard decision for Labour given that at one time the party\u2019s policy, then supported by Keir Starmer, was to scrap tuition fees altogether.</p> <p>Phillipson, however, sought to reassure students their monthly student loan repayments would not increase after graduation as a result of the changes.</p> <p>In return for the additional funding from fees, universities are being asked to improve value for money for students and break down barriers to opportunity for those from disadvantaged groups, with details of the reforms due to be published next year.</p> <p>The announcement was welcomed by vice-chancellors who have vigorously lobbied the new government for additional financial support, arguing the value of domestic tuition fees has been eroded by a third.</p> <p>Privately, however, many are concerned the increase will not be enough to plug the gaps as they simultaneously grapple with a drop in income from international students whose recruitment is down as a result of a clampdown on student visas.</p> <p>The University and College Union condemned the fee hike as \u201ceconomically and morally wrong\u201d. Jo Grady, the UCU general secretary, said: \u201cTaking more money from debt-ridden students and handing it to overpaid, underperforming vice-chancellors is ill-conceived and won\u2019t come close to addressing the sector\u2019s core issues.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/feb/29/student-immigration-restrictions-will-damage-uk-economy-universities-say\">Warnings of economic damage to UK as international student numbers fall by a third</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alex Stanley, vice-president for higher education at the National Union of Students, said students were being asked to \u201cfoot the bill to literally keep the lights and heating on in their uni buildings and prevent their courses from closing down\u201d.</p> <p>Laura Trott, in her new role as shadow education secretary, said: \u201cLast week, Labour declared war on businesses, private-sector workers and farmers with their budget. Now it seems they want to add students to the list.</p> <p>\u201cWith Keir Starmer elected to Labour leadership on a pledge to scrap tuition fees, no mention of the rise in the manifesto, and the education secretary saying in just July this year Labour had no plans to raise fees, students can be forgiven for feeling betrayed. This is another broken Labour promise to add to the long list.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year, the Office for Students, the higher education regulator in England, said an increasing number of universities faced \u201ca material risk of closure\u201d, with 40% expected to run budget deficits this year.</p> <p>Home Office figures, meanwhile, showed 16% fewer visa applications were made between July and September this year than in the same period in 2023.</p> <p>This has forced dozens of universities to reduce courses and cut jobs to save money. Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, said: \u201cToday\u2019s decision cannot have been easy for government, but it is the right thing to do.</p> <p>\u201cA decade-long freeze in England has seen inflation erode the real value of student fees and maintenance loans by around a third, which is completely unsustainable for both students and universities. Keeping pace with inflation stops the value of fees going down year after year.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "University tuition fees in England are to go up for the first time in eight years, taking annual payments up to a record \u00a39,535 per student, the government has announced. The inflation-linked increase, which comes into force in the next academic year, was approved by ministers after warnings of a deepening financial crisis in the university sector, where the value of tuition fees has crumbled after being capped at \u00a39,250 since 2017. To help soften the blow, Bridget Phillipson also announced a parallel increase to student maintenance loans, providing up to \u00a3414 extra per year to support students from the lowest-income families. The education secretary said: \u201cThis government\u2019s mission is to break down barriers to opportunity, which is why we are doing more to support students struggling with the cost of living despite the fiscal challenges our country faces. \u201cThe situation we have inherited means this government must take the tough decisions needed to put universities on a firmer financial footing so they can deliver more opportunity for students and growth for our economy.\u201d Under the one-year deal, fees and maintenance loans will go up in line with the RPIX measure of inflation \u2013 forecast at 3.1% \u2013 but there could be further increases if the government decides to revisit tuition fees in the spending review next year. Estimates have suggested fees could go up to as much as \u00a310,500 for students beginning university in 2029 if increases continue to be index-linked. Making the announcement in the Commons, Phillipson told MPs: \u201cIt is no use keeping tuition fees down for future students if the universities are not there for them to attend, nor if students can\u2019t afford to support themselves while they study.\u201d The increase to tuition fees will have been a particularly hard decision for Labour given that at one time the party\u2019s policy, then supported by Keir Starmer, was to scrap tuition fees altogether. Phillipson, however, sought to reassure students their monthly student loan repayments would not increase after graduation as a result of the changes. In return for the additional funding from fees, universities are being asked to improve value for money for students and break down barriers to opportunity for those from disadvantaged groups, with details of the reforms due to be published next year. The announcement was welcomed by vice-chancellors who have vigorously lobbied the new government for additional financial support, arguing the value of domestic tuition fees has been eroded by a third. Privately, however, many are concerned the increase will not be enough to plug the gaps as they simultaneously grapple with a drop in income from international students whose recruitment is down as a result of a clampdown on student visas. The University and College Union condemned the fee hike as \u201ceconomically and morally wrong\u201d. Jo Grady, the UCU general secretary, said: \u201cTaking more money from debt-ridden students and handing it to overpaid, underperforming vice-chancellors is ill-conceived and won\u2019t come close to addressing the sector\u2019s core issues.\u201d Alex Stanley, vice-president for higher education at the National Union of Students, said students were being asked to \u201cfoot the bill to literally keep the lights and heating on in their uni buildings and prevent their courses from closing down\u201d. Laura Trott, in her new role as shadow education secretary, said: \u201cLast week, Labour declared war on businesses, private-sector workers and farmers with their budget. Now it seems they want to add students to the list. \u201cWith Keir Starmer elected to Labour leadership on a pledge to scrap tuition fees, no mention of the rise in the manifesto, and the education secretary saying in just July this year Labour had no plans to raise fees, students can be forgiven for feeling betrayed. This is another broken Labour promise to add to the long list.\u201d Earlier this year, the Office for Students, the higher education regulator in England, said an increasing number of universities faced \u201ca material risk of closure\u201d, with 40% expected to run budget deficits this year. Home Office figures, meanwhile, showed 16% fewer visa applications were made between July and September this year than in the same period in 2023. This has forced dozens of universities to reduce courses and cut jobs to save money. Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, said: \u201cToday\u2019s decision cannot have been easy for government, but it is the right thing to do. \u201cA decade-long freeze in England has seen inflation erode the real value of student fees and maintenance loans by around a third, which is completely unsustainable for both students and universities. Keeping pace with inflation stops the value of fees going down year after year.\u201d",

In 2020, despite losing the popular vote by 7 million, Mr Trump refused to concede and sought to undermine the certification process.

Now he is laying the groundwork for future claims of fraud with a barrage of lies, preparing to cry foul if he loses again.</p> <p>Under the electoral college, candidates must secure 270 electors, a majority of the 538 at stake, in order to win. <a href=\"https://www.gilderlehrman.org/sites/default/files/inline-pdfs/Arguments%20for%20the%20Electoral%20College_0.pdf\">Supporters</a> argue that by granting each state a set number of electoral votes and adopting the winner-take-all system in all but two states, the electoral college compels candidates to engage with diverse regions across the country. In theory, this fosters nationwide attention, but in practice it often fails to achieve this goal. Kamala Harris and Mr Trump have focused their efforts in the large, competitive states. Ms Harris has concentrated her efforts on the \u201cblue wall\u201d of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2013 which current polls suggest would be enough to put her in the White House. Mr Trump needs just Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina. In Pennsylvania alone, the Harris and Trump campaigns have collectively spent $<a href=\"https://www.capradio.org/articles/2024/11/01/more-than-10-billion-has-been-spent-on-ads-in-the-2024-election/\">576m</a> in political advertising.</p> <p>In his book Why the Electoral College Is Bad for America, the historian <a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/2016/11/16/the-flawed-foundations-of-the-electoral-college/\">George C Edwards III</a> points out that Gallup polls over the past 50 years show most \u201cAmericans have continually expressed support for the notion of an official amendment of the US constitution that would allow for direct election of the president\u201d. It isn\u2019t a fantasy. In <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/electoral-college-nearly-abolished-thurmond\">1969</a>, the House passed such an amendment with a strong bipartisan vote, backed by Richard Nixon. Three-fourths of states signalled support. But it was killed in the Senate by a filibuster led by southern senators who feared that a popular vote would empower African Americans. The most prominent effort to get rid of the electoral college today is the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact.

With numerous legal challenges expected, the final election outcome may be delayed for days. In 2020, despite losing the popular vote by 7 million, Mr Trump refused to concede and sought to undermine the certification process. The electoral college\u2019s complex mechanics allow room for exploitation, a vulnerability that Mr Trump appears willing to leverage, even if it means inciting violence. Now he is laying the groundwork for future claims of fraud with a barrage of lies, preparing to cry foul if he loses again. Under the electoral college, candidates must secure 270 electors, a majority of the 538 at stake, in order to win. Supporters argue that by granting each state a set number of electoral votes and adopting the winner-take-all system in all but two states, the electoral college compels candidates to engage with diverse regions across the country. In theory, this fosters nationwide attention, but in practice it often fails to achieve this goal. Kamala Harris and Mr Trump have focused their efforts in the large, competitive states. Ms Harris has concentrated her efforts on the \u201cblue wall\u201d of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2013 which current polls suggest would be enough to put her in the White House. Mr Trump needs just Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina. In Pennsylvania alone, the Harris and Trump campaigns have collectively spent $576m in political advertising. In his book Why the Electoral College Is Bad for America, the historian George C Edwards III points out that Gallup polls over the past 50 years show most \u201cAmericans have continually expressed support for the notion of an official amendment of the US constitution that would allow for direct election of the president\u201d. It isn\u2019t a fantasy. In 1969, the House passed such an amendment with a strong bipartisan vote, backed by Richard Nixon. Three-fourths of states signalled support. But it was killed in the Senate by a filibuster led by southern senators who feared that a popular vote would empower African Americans. The most prominent effort to get rid of the electoral college today is the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. Tim Walz, Ms Harris\u2019s running mate, backs scrapping the present system. Is it possible to abolish the electoral college? It shouldn\u2019t need the nightmare of a second Trump presidency to reform this antidemocratic relic of the 18th century.

      "body": "<p>An alleged intelligence leak from Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office has ballooned into a major scandal for the Israeli prime minister after a court partly lifted a gag order on the case, saying that the affair may have undermined efforts to reach a hostage deal in the Gaza war.</p> <p>Four people have been arrested in connection with the joint investigation by the police, internal security services and the army, a court in the city of Rishon LeZion said on Sunday night. </p> <p>The central suspect was named as Eliezer Feldstein, whom the Israeli media said was hired as a spokesperson and media adviser in the prime minister\u2019s office shortly after the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. The other three people to be arrested are members of the security establishment.</p> <p>A partial gag order is still in place, but the case involves a \u201cbreach of national security caused by the unlawful provision of classified information\u201d that \u201charmed the achievement of Israel\u2019s war aims\u201d, the court said on Friday.</p> <p>The suspects are alleged to have been involved in leaking Hamas strategy documents found by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, and manipulating or editing the material to make it seem as though the Palestinian militant group\u2019s leadership planned to drag out the talks as long as possible, as well as smuggle hostages to Egypt.</p> <p>Reports apparently based on the doctored documents <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/14/crisis-at-jewish-chronicle-as-stories-are-withdrawn\">appeared in the British outlet the Jewish Chronicle</a> and the German tabloid Bild in September, leading the IDF to launch an investigation. The Jewish Chronicle later retracted the story and fired the journalist who wrote it.</p> <p>Netanyahu\u2019s detractors say the articles appeared at a time when he was facing renewed criticism over his handling of the negotiations after six killed hostages were found in a tunnel in Rafah.</p> <p>The reports also appear to have bolstered Netanyahu\u2019s new demand in the talks after a conditional framework had already been reached \u2013 that Israeli troops remain on the Gaza-Egypt border. The demand was rejected by Hamas, and the talks foundered.</p> <p>Netanyahu has long been accused of stalling on a deal as a way to appease his far-right coalition partners, for whom any concession to Hamas is untenable. He is believed to see staying in office as the best way of avoiding prosecution in longstanding corruption charges, which he denies.</p> <p>In a statement on Monday, the Hostage Families Forum, which represents most of the friends and relatives of the abductees, said it demanded an investigation \u201cagainst all those suspected of sabotage and undermining state security\u201d.</p> <p>It added: \u201cThe suspicions suggest that individuals associated with the prime minister acted to carry out one of the greatest frauds in the country\u2019s history. This is a moral low point like no other.

      "bodyText": "An alleged intelligence leak from Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office has ballooned into a major scandal for the Israeli prime minister after a court partly lifted a gag order on the case, saying that the affair may have undermined efforts to reach a hostage deal in the Gaza war. Four people have been arrested in connection with the joint investigation by the police, internal security services and the army, a court in the city of Rishon LeZion said on Sunday night. The central suspect was named as Eliezer Feldstein, whom the Israeli media said was hired as a spokesperson and media adviser in the prime minister\u2019s office shortly after the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. The other three people to be arrested are members of the security establishment. A partial gag order is still in place, but the case involves a \u201cbreach of national security caused by the unlawful provision of classified information\u201d that \u201charmed the achievement of Israel\u2019s war aims\u201d, the court said on Friday. The suspects are alleged to have been involved in leaking Hamas strategy documents found by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, and manipulating or editing the material to make it seem as though the Palestinian militant group\u2019s leadership planned to drag out the talks as long as possible, as well as smuggle hostages to Egypt. Reports apparently based on the doctored documents appeared in the British outlet the Jewish Chronicle and the German tabloid Bild in September, leading the IDF to launch an investigation. The Jewish Chronicle later retracted the story and fired the journalist who wrote it. Netanyahu\u2019s detractors say the articles appeared at a time when he was facing renewed criticism over his handling of the negotiations after six killed hostages were found in a tunnel in Rafah. The reports also appear to have bolstered Netanyahu\u2019s new demand in the talks after a conditional framework had already been reached \u2013 that Israeli troops remain on the Gaza-Egypt border. The demand was rejected by Hamas, and the talks foundered. Netanyahu has long been accused of stalling on a deal as a way to appease his far-right coalition partners, for whom any concession to Hamas is untenable. He is believed to see staying in office as the best way of avoiding prosecution in longstanding corruption charges, which he denies. In a statement on Monday, the Hostage Families Forum, which represents most of the friends and relatives of the abductees, said it demanded an investigation \u201cagainst all those suspected of sabotage and undermining state security\u201d. It added: \u201cThe suspicions suggest that individuals associated with the prime minister acted to carry out one of the greatest frauds in the country\u2019s history. This is a moral low point like no other. It is a severe blow to the remaining trust between the government and its citizens.\u201d Netanyahu has sought to downplay the affair, calling for the gag order to be lifted and accusing the judiciary of bias. On Saturday he denied any involvement in the leak, or wrongdoing on the part of his staff. The main suspect, Feldstein, \u201cnever participated in security discussions, was not exposed to or received classified information, and did not take part in secret visits\u201d, his office said. Questions have arisen over whether Feldstein was formally employed by the prime minister\u2019s office after reports were published alleging he failed a security clearance polygraph test; he has been photographed next to Netanyahu many times over the past year. The 32-year-old, from the ultra-Orthodox Tel Aviv suburb of Bnei Brak, previously worked for the far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and in the IDF\u2019s media unit. Feldstein was arrested on 27 October and has been remanded in custody until Tuesday, the date of his next hearing. One of the other three suspects is understood to have been released. The charges of leaking classified information, negligence in handling the material, and using it to influence public opinion, could result in a 15-year prison sentence, the ynet news site reported.",

      "bodyText": "The UK should take charge of future Europe-wide investigations into people-smuggling gangs as it seeks a new security deal with EU countries, Keir Starmer said on Monday. The prime minister has also indicated that EU leaders have shown an interest in giving the UK access to a key intelligence database used to identify people seeking asylum. His comments, made at an Interpol annual general assembly in Glasgow, come days before he meets EU leaders including the Italian PM, Giorgia Meloni, to discuss future cooperation. Emphasising his \u201cpersonal mission to smash the people-smuggling gangs\u201d, Starmer told journalists that he planned to improve on previous negotiations with European partners. \u201cI don\u2019t think we did as well as we should have done when we came to the question of cross-border crime and security, and that\u2019s why we want to improve on it. And that can be done at the EU level. \u201cI\u2019m very keen to get the UK into a leadership position when it comes to the actual operations, particularly in relation to smuggling and putting people into small boats across the Channel,\u201d he said. It is understood that the government is seeking access to Eurodac, which stores the fingerprints of asylum seekers and migrants who have entered a European country. He continued: \u201cThere is an appetite to work more closely with us on this. Because, look, these are shared challenges. \u201cThey [EU leaders] also do value what the UK has to offer. That has always been my strong view and it remains my strong view. They know that we\u2019ve very good intelligence, very good capability.\u201d Starmer went into further detail about how a deal with the EU could work and said he would push to regain access to the EU\u2019s real-time intelligence sharing networks. Starmer said the European convention on human rights, which some senior Tories have said should be scrapped, needs to \u201ckeep up to speed\u201d and be modernised but said the UK should remain a signatory. \u201cWell, the convention always needs to keep up to speed in changing circumstances, and it always has. And I approve of that. \u201cBut among the reasons we shouldn\u2019t withdraw is that all of this collaborative work is premised on these international agreements,\u201d he said. In a further development, ministers are examining plans to fast-track asylum applications from people who have arrived in the UK from specific \u201chigh grant rate\u201d countries, Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, said. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019re doing is getting the decision making speeded up right across the board. \u201cWe are also looking at ways in which we could develop a fast-track approach for predominantly safe countries, so that that can be linked to much swifter returns as well,\u201d she said. She declined to tell journalists which claimants could have their applications speeded up, but high grant rate countries include Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iran, Sudan and Syria. Analysis by the Refugee Council shows that nearly six out of 10 of the people who came across the Channel in the year leading up to the general election were from high grant rate countries. Starmer said the government should fast-track claims from people seeking asylum from countries with a high grant rate as well as those from \u201csafe\u201d countries. \u201cI think we should move all the cases through the system much more quickly. One of the problems we\u2019ve got is that the last government didn\u2019t process the claims, and that left us in the worst of all worlds, which was unprocessed claims,\u201d he said. Starmer said the government will \u201ctreat people smugglers like terrorists\u201d as he announced a further \u00a375m for his border security command. Anti-terror powers could be used to gather intelligence from suspected smugglers\u2019 phones and get ahead of gangs, Starmer said. \u201cWith counter-terrorism powers you can get in with the intelligence beforehand, the preparatory acts, in a much more meaningful way and get into some of the information that they are holding, particularly information held on phones etcetera and seizure of phones. \u201cWhat that will give us is the capability at speed to get ahead of what they\u2019re doing so it\u2019s more in the upstream work that the counter-terrorism powers really make a difference. \u201cThere are other powers that can then be put in place, which don\u2019t necessarily require a conviction, where you can restrict the activities of individuals. \u201cIt\u2019s those sorts of powers I\u2019m most interested in,\u201d he said. In a speech at the Interpol general assembly in Glasgow on Monday, Starmer said the government would double funding to \u00a3150m for the Border Security Command, the enforcement agency launched by the Labour government this summer. The border security, asylum and immigration bill, announced in the king\u2019s speech in July, will be the fourth piece of immigration legislation since 2022 as successive governments have attempted to tackle this issue. The prime minister also announced a \u00a36m increase in the UK\u2019s support for Interpol as it tackles global organised crime.",

      "body": "<p>One of the regular refrains from Keir Starmer\u2019s team during their wilderness years was that oppositions don\u2019t win elections, governments lose them. So, there is an argument for the opposition to not rock the boat unless it really has to. Four months into this Labour government, some in the Tory party have started to think such tactics might work for them: sit quietly and hope Starmer self-destructs.</p> <p>However, the election of Kemi Badenoch on Saturday changed that. MPs and members picked a leader who is not known for restraint. Instead, the Tory firebrand has won fans and critics in equal measure for her straight-talking approach that has seen her accused of being able to <a href=\"https://x.com/issywaite66/status/1852682803499901285\">start a fight in an empty room</a>.</p> <p>Now installed as leader of the opposition, the hope is that Badenoch can pick the right fights to get the Conservative party back into power. That means causing problems for Starmer to the left of her and Nigel Farage on the right. \u201cThere will be no Ming vase strategy,\u201d says a close supporter, ruling out a campaign run on caution. \u201cIt will be a \u2018run fast and try to change things\u2019 strategy. Kemi is a high-energy, high-risk, high-reward leader.\u201d</p> <p>In picking Badenoch, the Tories have ultimately decided that boldness is required. Sunday showed a sign of what is to come when Badenoch sat down with Laura Kuenssberg. The new Tory leader said she opposed Labour\u2019s private school VAT crackdown, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/03/tory-leader-kemi-badenoch-says-partygate-scandal-was-overblown\">played down aspects of Partygate</a>, and criticised Rachel Reeves for going on about being the first female chancellor. \u201cIt seemed to be a template of what\u2019s going to be the next year: newsmaking, chaotic, engaging,\u201d says a party source.</p> <p>That approach has won over the membership \u2013 what about the party and public? While Badenoch had the highest number of MP backers in the final parliamentary round <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/09/kemi-badenoch-or-robert-jenrick-will-be-tory-leader-after-cleverly-eliminated\">by one vote</a>, it\u2019s notable that no candidate managed much more than a third of MP support in the party. The last time that happened was 2001 \u2013 and it didn\u2019t exactly end well for the victor, Iain Duncan Smith, who was forced out in a confidence vote two years later.</p> <p>This time around, steps have been taken to minimise the chance of drama. The 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers <a href=\"https://x.com/christopherhope/status/1852681026448863737\">has raised the threshold</a> for the number of no-confidence letters required to trigger a confidence vote to a third of the parliamentary party. Yet Badenoch still needs to tread with caution. While most MPs are talking publicly about the need to unite, there is already discussion over whether she will make it to the election.</p> <p>The former chancellor George Osborne has suggested that Rishi Sunak could enjoy a renaissance on the backbench and return to lead the party at the next election \u2013 although \u201cGeorge has said it so that means it won\u2019t happen,\u201d according to one Tory aide. Privately, MPs wonder whether James Cleverly \u2013 who was knocked out in the final MP round \u2013 could steal the crown in the future. His decision to stay on the backbenches rather than join Badenoch\u2019s shadow cabinet will add to the sense that there is a prince across the water ready to move if things don\u2019t go to plan.</p> <p>Badenoch is under pressure to form a cabinet that represents the different parts of the party. Her first appointments have been chief whip \u2013 Rebecca Harris \u2013 and two loyal foot soldiers in Dominic Johnson and Nigel Huddleston as co-party chairs.</p> <p>In the wider reshuffle, she has brought in two former leadership rivals \u2013 Mel Stride as shadow chancellor and Priti Patel as shadow foreign secretary \u2013 following calls for her to reach out beyond her close cabal of fellow 2017 intake MPs.</p> <p>Ahead of the reshuffle, an old hand said what she offered the other leadership contenders would be an indicator of her direction. So far she has ticked the rivals box but appointed those who pose the least threat.</p> <p>The real key question was what to do with Robert Jenrick; there was little love between the two camps by the end of the process. Late on Monday it was reported that Jenrick is expected to be confirmed as shadow justice secretary.

      "bodyText": "One of the regular refrains from Keir Starmer\u2019s team during their wilderness years was that oppositions don\u2019t win elections, governments lose them. So, there is an argument for the opposition to not rock the boat unless it really has to. Four months into this Labour government, some in the Tory party have started to think such tactics might work for them: sit quietly and hope Starmer self-destructs. However, the election of Kemi Badenoch on Saturday changed that. MPs and members picked a leader who is not known for restraint. Instead, the Tory firebrand has won fans and critics in equal measure for her straight-talking approach that has seen her accused of being able to start a fight in an empty room. Now installed as leader of the opposition, the hope is that Badenoch can pick the right fights to get the Conservative party back into power. That means causing problems for Starmer to the left of her and Nigel Farage on the right. \u201cThere will be no Ming vase strategy,\u201d says a close supporter, ruling out a campaign run on caution. \u201cIt will be a \u2018run fast and try to change things\u2019 strategy. Kemi is a high-energy, high-risk, high-reward leader.\u201d In picking Badenoch, the Tories have ultimately decided that boldness is required. Sunday showed a sign of what is to come when Badenoch sat down with Laura Kuenssberg. The new Tory leader said she opposed Labour\u2019s private school VAT crackdown, played down aspects of Partygate, and criticised Rachel Reeves for going on about being the first female chancellor. \u201cIt seemed to be a template of what\u2019s going to be the next year: newsmaking, chaotic, engaging,\u201d says a party source. That approach has won over the membership \u2013 what about the party and public? While Badenoch had the highest number of MP backers in the final parliamentary round by one vote, it\u2019s notable that no candidate managed much more than a third of MP support in the party. The last time that happened was 2001 \u2013 and it didn\u2019t exactly end well for the victor, Iain Duncan Smith, who was forced out in a confidence vote two years later. This time around, steps have been taken to minimise the chance of drama. The 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers has raised the threshold for the number of no-confidence letters required to trigger a confidence vote to a third of the parliamentary party. Yet Badenoch still needs to tread with caution. While most MPs are talking publicly about the need to unite, there is already discussion over whether she will make it to the election. The former chancellor George Osborne has suggested that Rishi Sunak could enjoy a renaissance on the backbench and return to lead the party at the next election \u2013 although \u201cGeorge has said it so that means it won\u2019t happen,\u201d according to one Tory aide. Privately, MPs wonder whether James Cleverly \u2013 who was knocked out in the final MP round \u2013 could steal the crown in the future. His decision to stay on the backbenches rather than join Badenoch\u2019s shadow cabinet will add to the sense that there is a prince across the water ready to move if things don\u2019t go to plan. Badenoch is under pressure to form a cabinet that represents the different parts of the party. Her first appointments have been chief whip \u2013 Rebecca Harris \u2013 and two loyal foot soldiers in Dominic Johnson and Nigel Huddleston as co-party chairs. In the wider reshuffle, she has brought in two former leadership rivals \u2013 Mel Stride as shadow chancellor and Priti Patel as shadow foreign secretary \u2013 following calls for her to reach out beyond her close cabal of fellow 2017 intake MPs. Ahead of the reshuffle, an old hand said what she offered the other leadership contenders would be an indicator of her direction. So far she has ticked the rivals box but appointed those who pose the least threat. The real key question was what to do with Robert Jenrick; there was little love between the two camps by the end of the process. Late on Monday it was reported that Jenrick is expected to be confirmed as shadow justice secretary. But behind the scenes there are already nerves as to how their working relationship will play out. The next challenge is going to be on message. Already Labour is trying to force a political choice on Badenoch with regard to the budget. Asking if she rejects the employer national insurance rise, and if so, how would she give the NHS a \u00a322bn injection? Or would she simply not? Labour aides are having a field day trawling through her past comments. But when it comes to new policy, they could be left waiting. The new Tory leader wants to take time. This is one area where she is happy to learn from Starmer. His team were often criticised for failing to offer up policy \u2013 but it didn\u2019t harm him in the long term. It means the early part of her leadership will be defined as much by her personality and philosophy. She has spoken of her admiration for Roger Scruton, the late philosopher, as well as Thomas Sowell, the US economist. Her general diagnosis is that her party\u2019s failures have been driven by timidness \u2013 a slow slide into managerialism, as the Tories have lost confidence in their principles. Badenoch\u2019s antidote to this is to respond with authenticity, even if that means standing by views that challenge the status quo. It\u2019s an approach that could win back disillusioned Tory voters, but it could also provide plenty of fodder for her critics. Even her supporters are aware that it is a high-stakes gamble. \u201cIf she pulls it off it\u2019s going to be fantastic,\u201d says a member of the shadow cabinet. \u201cBut the risk is high.\u201d Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s political editor",

This means family farms which have been in the family for generations have rocketed in value, while their income has gone down, and now they are worried about being stung with a large tax bill when they pass it on to their families.</p> \n  <p><strong>Clarkson</strong> wrote in his column in the Sunday Times this Sunday:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I was overcome with something not far removed from fury.

Its principles are vague and could be exploited by vice-chancellors, while higher fees mean even more graduates will fail to pay back their loans, ultimately costing the exchequer.</p> \n   <p>The chancellor says \u2018invest, invest, invest\u2019: it is time to do that in higher education, especially if Labour is serious about delivering a decade of national renewal.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-672901a08f0842b343ae99c4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-04T17:18:42.474Z\">5.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Universities UK</strong>, which represents the universities sector, has welcomed the rise in tuition fees.

Increasing tuition fees will only see those who clear the loan in full over the 40yrs pay more. </strong>That is generally mid-high to higher earning university leavers only, so the cost of increasing them will generally be born by the more affluent. Most lower and middle earning university leavers will simply pay 9% extra tax above the threshold for 40yrs (and higher tuition fees won\u2019t change that) </p> \n   <p><strong>3.

Yet they were almost stealth changes because people can\u2019t intuitively feel the seismic impact. </p> \n   <p>Changing tuition fees is a more obvious rise, but in reality has far less of an impact on the amount most will repay (though combined with the 2023 changes it does certainly up the cost).</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6728df8b8f08b3d97c365237\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-04T15:00:04.387Z\">3.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Former MP Beth Winter quits Labour party, saying it's not socialist and just committed to retaining 'neoliberal status quo'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Beth Winter</strong>, who was a leftwing Labour MP for Cynon Valley from 2019 to 2024, has left the party.

We\u2019re also working together with international partners, sharing intelligence and tactics.</p> \n   <p>Earlier this year, I visited the headquarters of our National Crime Agency.

We could seize their phones at the border, identifying and tracing smugglers wiring payments. We\u2019ve already trained sniffer dogs to detect the smell of dinghy rubber and, working with Bulgaria, stopped more than 100 small boats upstream long before they made it to the Channel.</p> \n   <p>And as we understand how these gangs work, we can invest in new capabilities and enhance powers to smash them.</p> \n   <p>So we\u2019re giving our new Border Security Command an additional \u00a375m pounds of new funding, on top of the \u00a375m pounds we have already committed. This will support a new organized Immigration Crime Intelligence Unit, hundreds of new investigators and intelligence officers, backed by state of the art technology.</p> \n   <p>We are also investing a further \u00a358m pounds in our National Crime Agency, including strengthening its data analysis and intelligence capabilities.

      "bodyText": "Kemi Badenoch has appointed Mel Stride shadow chancellor and Priti Patel shadow foreign secretary as she began to put together a Conservative frontbench team billed as uniting the party. And Robert Jenrick is becoming shadow justice secretary, Steven Swinford from the Times reports. He says: Robert Jenrick has accepted the role of shadow justice secretary in Kemi Badenoch\u2019s new shadow cabinet Badenoch offered him the role after a bitterly fought leadership contest An ally of Jenrick said: \u2018Rob thinks the party needs to come together and take the fight to Labour. Unity could not be more important. He\u2019s eager to expose Labour\u2019s dreadful record on law and order\u2019 University tuition fees in England are to go up next autumn for the first time in eight years, the government has said. The Conservatives have described this as a broken promised. Laura Trott, the new shadow education secretary, said: With Keir Starmer elected to Labour leadership on a pledge to scrap tuition fees, no mention of the rise in the manifesto, and the education secretary saying in just July this year Labour had no plans to raise fees, students can be forgiven for feeling betrayed. This is another broken Labour promise to add to the long list. The government argument that just one-third of farmers will be affected by the new inheritance tax rules is in direct conflict with data produced by the its own environment department, the NFU has pointed out. Keir Starmer has said people smuggling should be seen as a global security threat similar to terrorism. (See 11.36am.) Mel Stride, the new shadow chancellor, is on record as saying that he thinks parental benefits are too generous. Labour sources have been flagging up an article that Stride wrote for ConservativeHome in 2012, when he was a backbencher, saying maternity and paternity leave rights meant it was \u201cnot uncommon for an employee to take multiple breaks from work in relatively close proximity and for up to a year on each occasion\u201d. This was unfair on employers, he argued. He went on: The politics around this issue are tricky, with worldwide experience showing that changes in this area of employment law tend to ratchet in one direction alone \u2013 towards greater generosity to employees \u2026 There have though been some notable examples of countries rowing back in this area in recent years, including Germany. If we want to provide a massive shot in the arm for British business and entrepreneurship I would hope that we could seriously consider following their example with at least a close look at relaxations in protected-employment legislation for smaller businesses. Kemi Badenoch, the new Tory leader, would almost certainly agree, based on what she said about maternity pay and business regulations during Tory conference. The Russell Group, which represents leading, research-focused universities, has in a statement described the rise in tuition fees as \u201ca welcome sign that government is engaging seriously with the financial difficulties facing universities and students\u201d. Amazon prime star and Sunday Times columnist Jeremy Clarkson has been full throated in his opposition to Labour\u2019s changes to agricultural property relief which will mean farms worth more than \u00a31m will have to pay inheritance tax. He has accused Keir Starmer of \u2018shafting\u2019 farmers. Clarkson previously admitted a perk of buying his farm, now famous on the show Clarkson\u2019s Farm, was that he could avoid inheritance tax. But Daniel Zeichner, the farming minister, hit back at Clarkson during the urgent question earlier. (See 3.48pm.) He said: Not only do those people [critics of the policy] seem to relish finding ways of creatively running their accounts, some of them of course take money to write columns about it as well. Many farmers have expressed genuine concerns about the changes, arguing the threshold has been set too low as people buying up farmland has artificially inflated the price, when the amount of money that can be made from farming it is very low. This means family farms which have been in the family for generations have rocketed in value, while their income has gone down, and now they are worried about being stung with a large tax bill when they pass it on to their families. Clarkson wrote in his column in the Sunday Times this Sunday: I was overcome with something not far removed from fury. Because, if the word on the rural grapevine about a farmer\u2019s suicide is accurate, their policy, born of bitterness and envy, may already have tipped one man over the edge. And there they were grinning. In the past five years agricultural land has become the must-have accessory for people in suits. And because investment bankers tend to be quite rich, the prices have gone berserk. Round where I live, people have been paying \u00a330,000 an acre. That means a 500-acre farm now goes for \u00a315m. And that doesn\u2019t include the house. Or the barns. Or the equipment. That\u2019s just the price of the land. But the University and College Union (UCU), which represents university staff, has criticised the tuition fees increase. Its general secretary, Jo Grady said: Taking more money from debt ridden students and handing it to overpaid, underperforming vice-chancellors is ill-conceived and won\u2019t come close to addressing the sector\u2019s core issues. As Keir Starmer himself said last year, the current fees system doesn\u2019t work for students and doesn\u2019t work for universities. The model is broken; it has saddled students with decades of debt, turned universities from sites of learning into corporations obsessed with generating revenue, and continually degraded staff pay and working conditions. Labour accepts the issues facing higher education are systemic yet has only applied a sticking plaster. Its principles are vague and could be exploited by vice-chancellors, while higher fees mean even more graduates will fail to pay back their loans, ultimately costing the exchequer. The chancellor says \u2018invest, invest, invest\u2019: it is time to do that in higher education, especially if Labour is serious about delivering a decade of national renewal. Universities UK, which represents the universities sector, has welcomed the rise in tuition fees. Its chief executive, Vivienne Stern said: A decade-long freeze in England has seen inflation erode the real value of student fees and maintenance loans by around a third, which is completely unsustainable for both students and universities. Keeping pace with inflation stops the value of fees going down year after year. Importantly, this change will not see students paying more to study upfront; repayments are linked to earnings above a \u00a325,000 threshold. The increase in maintenance loans is also very welcome and important. Here is the Department for Education\u2019s paper with details about the tuition fee increase. Here is a DfE paper about the new arrangments for loans for living costs. And here is a DfE paper about fees and loans for foundation years. Laura Trott, the shadow education secretary, said today\u2019s announcement showed that the government was declaring war on students, just as it declared war on the private sector, on business and on farmers. She said that Keir Starmer promised to get rid of tuition fees when he was standing for the Labour leadership. And Phillipson herself said at the time of the king\u2019s speech that she had no plans to raise tuition fees, Trott said. She said this was another example of broken promises. In response, Phillipson accused Trott of \u201cfaux outrage\u201d. And she said Trott had not said whether the Tories were opposing the increase or supporting it. Phillipson also says she wants to see universities do more to contribute to local economies, and to promote social mobility. She says they should be helping more disadvantaged students to go university. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, says the last government left the university sector in a mess. She says she is making two sets of announcements. First, the government will secure the future of universities. From April 2025, the maximum cap for tuition fees will go up in line with inflation, from \u00a39,250 to \u00a39,535. That is an increase of \u00a3285 per year, she says. (Most universities charge the maximum amount.) She says graduates will not have to pay more each month after they graduate. And she says the maximum maintenance payment will go up, meaning that in 2025-26 they will be worth an extra \u00a3414. She also says there will be a lower fee limit of \u00a35,760 for foundation years in classroom-based subjects. Before the tuition fees announcement, Linsday Hoyle, the Speaker, told Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, he was angry about the news being leaked to the media first. Phillipson said she would investigate the leak. Mel Stride, the former work and pensions secretary, has been made shadow chancellor, the BBC is reporting. And Priti Patel, the former home secretary, is shadow foreign secretary. This suggests Kemi Badenoch is serious when she says she wants to unite the party. Stride is a senior figure on the left of the party, and Patel is a prominent rightwinger. Stride and Patel were both also candidates in this year\u2019s leadership contest. Patel does have an interest in foreign policy. When she was international development secretary, she was sacked by Theresa May for in effect operating as a freelance foreign secretary \u2013 holding meetings with ministers in Israel without Downing Street\u2019s approval. Yesterday Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli PM, posted a message on social media congratulating Badenoch on her election victory. Back to tuition fees, and Paul Lewis, the financial broadcaster, says putting up tuition fees will mean the government has a bit more headroom for borrowing. There is little point in raising university tuition fees (in England) except of course that the govt now counts student debt as an asset to borrow against and this will make that bigger. It will reduce the chance of debts being repaid before the 40 year cancellation line. Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, claims Keir Starmer\u2019s language about the threat posed by illegal migration this morning (see 9.13am) is similar to language his party has used. The government has said that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of farmers will be able to pass their farm on to their children despite inheritance tax being extended to cover some farms. In a statement issued ahead of the urgent question, a government spokesperson said: The government\u2019s commitment to our farmers remains steadfast. It\u2019s why we have committed \u00a35bn to the farming budget over two years \u2013 more money than ever for sustainable food production. We understand concerns about changes to agricultural property relief and the Defra secretary of state and exchequer secretary to the Treasury met with NFU president Tom Bradshaw today. Ministers made clear that the vast majority of those claiming relief will not be affected by these changes. They will be able to pass the family farm down to their children just as previous generations have always done. This is a fair and balanced approach that protects the family farm while also fixing the public services that we all rely on. We remain committed to working with the NFU and listening to farmers. Andrew Mitchell, the shadow foreign secretary, has said he won\u2019t be serving in Kemi Badenoch\u2019s shadow cabinet. That is not particularly surprising; he first served as a minister in the 1990s, Badenoch talks about wanting to look to the future, and Mitchell is not on her wing of the party anyway. In a statement on social media, Mitchell says it is time to \u201cpass the baton'\u201d. It has been an honour to serve under Rishi Sunak as Deputy Foreign Secretary and Shadow Foreign Secretary. But it is time to pass the baton! I look forward to continue serving my constituents in the Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield. Kemi Badenoch will have my full support from the backbenches as she rebuilds the Conservative Party, exposes the terrible Labour government and sets us on a path to victory at the next general election. The Treasury says that 73% of farms will not qualify for inheritance tax under the plans announced in the budget. (See 12.26pm.) But the NFU says only 34% of farms are worth less than \u00a31m, which is the new threshold where inheritance tax will kick in. In a news release, the NFU says the discrepancy is explained by the fact that the Treasury\u2019s 73% figure is based on farms just claiming agricultural property relief. It does not include farms also claiming business property relief, the NFU says. And the 73% figure also includes smallholdings. Tom Bradshaw, the NFU president, said: Far from protecting smaller family farms, which is what ministers say they\u2019re doing, they\u2019re actually protecting private houses in the country with a few acres let out for grazing whilst disproportionately hammering actual, food-producing farms which are, on paper, much more valuable. Even Defra\u2019s own figures show this, which is why they\u2019re so different to the Treasury data this policy is based on. Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem chair of the Commons environment committee, tabled the urgent question. He said farmers rely on longterm planning. And they trusted the assurances from Labour before the election that the inheritance tax rules for farmers would not change. He says, although farms are valuable assets, that does not mean farmers are wealthy. He challenged ministers to publish the data used to justify the Treasury\u2019s claim that most farms will not be affected by the change. In response, Daniel Zeichner, an environment minister, said that the current rules only came into force in 1992. Before that, the exemption defended by Carmichael did not exist, he said. Daniel Zeichner, an environment minister, is replying to the urgent question, tabled by the Lib Dem MP Alistair Carmichael. Zeichner said the government\u2019s commitment to farming was \u201cunwavering\u201d. It has committed \u00a35bn to the agricultural budget over the next two years, he said. He said the Tories left a \u00a322bn black hole in the national finances, and the government had to take tough decisions. He said 20% of the value of the inheritance tax exemption for farmers was going to the wealthiest 2% of estates, and 40% of it was going to the wealthiest 7%. He said the current rules were being used \u201cby wealthy landowners to avoid inheritance tax\u201d. He said that Steve Reed, the environment secretary, met the NFU this morning (see 12.26pm) and the government completely understood their concerns. But he said people in rural areas needed a better NHS, better transport and better housing \u2013 measures funded by the budget \u2013 just as much as everyone else. And he said that, under the plans, an individual would be able to leave a farm worth \u00a32m to children without having to pay inheritance tax, and a couple could leave a farm worth \u00a33m. (See 12.49pm.) UPDATE: Zeichner said: Currently, small farms can find themselves facing the same levels of tax bills as much larger farms, despite having a much smaller asset. 20% of inheritance tax is claimed by the top 2%, 40% is claimed by the top 7%, that\u2019s not fair, it\u2019s not sustainable, and sadly, it\u2019s been used, in some cases by wealthy landowners to avoid inheritance tax, and that\u2019s why this government has announced plans to reform agricultural property relief. 73% of agricultural property relief claims are less than one million pounds, the vast majority of farmers will not be affected, they\u2019ll be able to pass a family farm down to their children, just as previous generations have always done. It\u2019s a fair, balanced approach that protects family farms, while also fixing the public services those same families rely on. In the Commons education question has now finished. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, was not asked about tuition fees during the session, but she is delivering a statement about it later, at around 4.15pm. First, there is an urgent question on the budget, farms and inheritance tax. Sam Freedman, who worked as a policy adviser in the Department for Education when Michael Gove was eduction secretary and who now writes a popular Substack politics blog, has posted this on social media about tuition fees going up. RPI increase in tuition fees is necessary as a holding policy to stop the HE sector falling over, but it\u2019s not a solution to a funding model that is putting young professionals under too much pressure (alongside housing costs and lower income tax thresholds). Nick Hillman, who runs the Higher Policy Education Institute, a thinktank, and who used to work as an adviser to David Willetts when he was a Tory universities minister, says the Tories will be tempted to oppose the tuition fees increase, but that it would be more responsible not to. He posted this on social media. Big test this pm for the new Shadow Education Team. Will they oppose tuition fee rises, as new oppositions tend to do (before recanting years later as they get closer to power). Or will they be more statesmanlike? The Green party says Labour should be abolishing tuition fees, not raising them. In a statement, the Green MP Ellie Chowns said: Tuition fees have forced universities to prioritize profit over education and put many at risk of bankruptcy, while students face extortionate interest rates- except for those wealthy enough not to need a loan. They have been a disaster and should be scrapped, not increased. Martin Lewis, the consumer champion and founder of the MoneySavingExpert website, has put a useful explainer about the tuition fees increase on social media. Here is an extract. 1. Higher tuition fees WON\u2019T change what most pay each year. For most, they\u2019re paid for you by the student loans company and you repay afterwards only if you earn over the threshold. The amount you repay each year (9% over the threshold) solely depends on what you earn not on what you borrow. 2. Increasing tuition fees will only see those who clear the loan in full over the 40yrs pay more. That is generally mid-high to higher earning university leavers only, so the cost of increasing them will generally be born by the more affluent. Most lower and middle earning university leavers will simply pay 9% extra tax above the threshold for 40yrs (and higher tuition fees won\u2019t change that) 3. The rise is tuition fees is likely to be trivial compared to the changes the last govt made for 2023 starters. 2023 starters had their repayment thresholds dropped to \u00a325,000 (from \u00a327,295/yr) and had the time they had to keep repaying for (unless cleared) extended to 40years from 30years. So these higher annual repayments for longer, increased by over 50% the amount many graduates will eventually have to pay back for going to university. Yet they were almost stealth changes because people can\u2019t intuitively feel the seismic impact. Changing tuition fees is a more obvious rise, but in reality has far less of an impact on the amount most will repay (though combined with the 2023 changes it does certainly up the cost). Beth Winter, who was a leftwing Labour MP for Cynon Valley from 2019 to 2024, has left the party. In a statement reported by Left Foot Forward, she said: It has been the greatest honour of my life to serve as the MP for my home, Cynon Valley, elected on the transformative Labour manifesto of 2019. As a proud socialist I have remained committed to that manifesto\u2019s vision for a fairer, more equal, and greener society \u2018for the many, not the few\u2019. Sadly, the Labour party no longer represents that socialist vision and I have, therefore, decided today to cease my membership. Today\u2019s Labour party is unrecognisable. I cannot in all conscience remain in a political party that is pursuing an authoritarian political agenda whose primary objective is to retain the neoliberal status quo, serve corporate interests and protect the ruling class. The Social Market Foundation, a centrist thinktank, has said that it expects Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, to announce an increase in maintenance loans alongside the rise in tuition fees. In a statement Dani Payne, an SMF researcher, said: The announcement this afternoon for a one-off inflationary rise to tuition fees and maintenance loans is a sensible and necessary step given the financial pressures facing institutions and students, but must come hand-in-hand with greater financial accountability from universities. With over a third of providers reporting deficits, and growing concerns about the potential of institutions collapsing entirely, it is right that the government has stepped in to stabilise the sector. The increase in maintenance loans is particularly welcome. The government has committed to supporting the aspiration of any person who is academically able to attend university. Unfortunately, for too long disadvantaged young people have either been priced out of higher education, or go to university but have a much thinner experience than their more affluent peers because they have to work hours incompatible with a full-time education. And Torsten Bell, who until the general election was head of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, has also defended the decision to impose inheritance tax on some farms as robustly as his IFS opposite number, Paul Johnson. (See 2pm.) Bell, who is now a Labour MP and parliamentary private secretary to Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister, posted these on social media this morning. Not news = those hugely benefitting from a tax exemption, despite never being the intended beneficiaries, are opposed to reform of that tax exemption It takes a special kind of nonsense speak to claim the way to protect future generations of farmers is to provide a large tax incentive for non-farmers to buy up land, pricing actual would be farmers out. That is exactly what the status quo does It\u2019s also totally untrue that a farm worth \u2018only \u00a31m\u2019 will be affected. A couple passing on a farm + farmhouse worth \u00a33m will remain entirely exempt from inheritance tax Defending the status quo means defending a system in which those with the very largest estates pay lower tax rates than many who are far less well off. We can\u2019t afford that situation to continue if we\u2019re to repair the public services (almost) everyone relies on Choices matter. The Tories repeatedly raised income tax (via threshold freezes) in part because they wouldn\u2019t address huge problems with our inheritance/capital gains taxes. Opposing these changes now means cuts to public services or tax rises for those on far lower incomes I\u2019ve heard several people (gentle nudge @RoryStewartUK) claim it\u2019s the historic norm that all agricultural land is IHT exempt. This isn\u2019t true - it\u2019s a recent shift introduced by Lamont in 1992. Note he said it was meant to be for \u201cworking farmers\u201d Commentators are already criticising the government\u2019s decision to increase tuition fees in England. This is from Sonia Sodha, the Observer\u2019s chief leader writer. This is from Jason Groves, political editor of the Daily Mail. And this is from James McEnaney, an education writer for the Herald. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, is taking questions in the Commons at 2.30pm. There are no questions on the order paper about tuition fees, but the topic is bound to come up at topical questions at 3.15pm. And Phillipson is due to give a formal Commons statement on the announcement at around 4.15pm. There is also an urgent question, at 3.30pm, about inheritance tax and farming. Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, has dismissed criticism of the government\u2019s decision to impose inheritance tax on some farms as In an interview with Times Radio, he said he had \u201cabsolutely no sympathy\u201d with people like Jeremy Clarkson and Sir James Dyson (see 10.34am), who have been leading the attack on the government on this. He said. This is special pleading by some extremely wealthy people. Very few farms will be affected by this, for example. And in any case, if you think we should have an inheritance tax \u2013 and you may or may not think that \u2013 but if we have one, then really you do need to treat most things similarly. There\u2019s no other country in Europe, or hardly any others, that completely exempt business assets and agricultural assets from inheritance tax. We never used to. [That] didn\u2019t destroy family farms. I\u2019m disappointed, actually, to see such special pleading given such prominence. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, is going to announce a rise in tuition fees for England in the Commons this afternoon. Sally Weale reports: University tuition fees in England are to go up next autumn for the first time in eight years, the government will announce this afternoon. If linked to inflation, it could take fees up to a record \u00a39,500 in October 2025, providing some respite for universities who have been struggling with a deepening financial crisis. Domestic undergraduate tuition fees in England have been capped at \u00a39,250 since 2017 but have been eroded in value by high inflation, forcing universities to rely on uncapped tuition fees from international students to balance their books. While any increase would be welcomed by vice-chancellors, it is likely to be deeply unpopular with current and future students, who were once told by the Labour party that tuition fees would be scrapped. The age at which victims of domestic abuse are recognised as such by law is to be looked at by the government after a teenager was killed by her ex-boyfriend, PA Media reports. Holly Newton was 15 when she was murdered in Hexham, Northumberland, by her stalker ex-boyfriend in January 2023. In an interview on the Today programme, Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, was asked about calls from Holly\u2019s parents to change the law so that under-16s can be considered victims of domestic abuse. Cooper said: We will particularly, specifically look at this, because we need to make sure that we have got the right ways of recording this kind of violence in teenage relationships \u2026 I have all sympathy with Holly\u2019s family. I can\u2019t imagine what they will have gone through. This was a truly awful case. Of course, there is domestic abuse in teenage relationships. There is violence within teenage relationships that we have seen increasing, and it really troubles me that we have seen it increasing. Downing Street has criticised the tweet describing Kemi Badenoch as a white supremacist that was reposted, but then deleted, by the Labour MP Dawn Butler. (See 9.52am.) At the morning lobby briefing the PM\u2019s spokesperson said Keir Starmer thought this comment was \u201cclearly wrong\u201d. Anas Sarwar, Scotland\u2019s Labour leader, has said that, in electing Kemi Badenoch as the new Conservative party leader, the Tories do not \u201crecognise the damages done\u201d over the past 14 years. He said: It\u2019s not recognised the dire consequence of pushing to the right and the politics of division and decline. Sarwar also said he didn\u2019t think people in Scotland or the UK would \u201cwarm\u201d to Badenoch and that electing her was \u201cbad for the country\u201d. He told the Guardian: Having an opposition party that gets more and more extreme that seeks to divide our communities further and further, is not a good force for positive outcome from politics. Scottish Tory leader Russell Findlay has described Kemi Badenoch as \u201ca woman of great integrity\u201d as he revealed he had voted for her in the recent Tory leadership contest. Findlay, himself newly elected as the leader of the party in Scotland, told BBC Radio Scotland: I really admire the fact she isn\u2019t afraid to say it how she sees it, and if that sometimes upsets people, so be it. He said it was \u201chealthy\u201d that Badenoch had recognised the mistakes of Partygate and Brexit. She has very quickly identified where things have gone wrong and how we have a responsibility and a golden opportunity in [the 2026 Scottish parliament elections] to put them right. Asked about recent polling which suggested that the Scottish Tories were on track to lose their position as the official opposition in Holyrood at the 2026 election Findlay denied it was a \u201cfait accompli\u201d. It\u2019s my job, and it\u2019s my colleagues\u2019 job to persuade the people of Scotland that we are on their side and fight for every single vote. After Badenoch was highly critical of devolution in a speech at Conservative party. Findlay said: When I look around at Holyrood, I do wonder why so much time is spent on fringe issues, when what really matters to people is jobs, the economy, housing, the NHS, education. All of these things in a quarter of a century of devolution have got worse by any measure. Jasper Jolly and Peter Walker published a good explainer on farms and inheritance tax last week. They pointed out that, although the rules are changing so that inheritance tax will kick in after \u00a31m, taking other tax allowances into account, farming families could pass on a home worth \u00a33m without being liable for inheritance tax. They explain: Pre-budget analysis by the Centre for the Analysis of Taxation (CenTax) suggested that only 200 estates out of 1,300 a year between 2018 and 2020 claimed more than \u00a31m in relief each year. Those 200 estates \u2013 by definition among the wealthiest in Britain \u2013 reaped 64% of all the agricultural relief. The updated relief can in fact be even more generous for true family farms than the \u00a31m headline. A married couple owning a farm together can split it in two, meaning it qualifies for \u00a32m of agricultural property relief, plus another \u00a3500,000 for each partner if a property is involved. That means a farm worth \u00a33m might pay zero inheritance tax, said Arun Advani, associate professor of economics at the University of Warwick and a director of CenTax. Even farms worth \u00a35m might in practice only pay inheritance tax of less than 1% a year, because they will be allowed to spread the cost over 10 years. The full article is here. Laura Trott is the new shadow education secretary, in the first policy-based frontbench appointment under Kemi Badenoch. While the bulk of her appointments will be made later, before tomorrow morning\u2019s shadow cabinet meeting, Trott will appear for the Tories at education questions in the Commons at 2.30pm. Joining her on the front bench will be Neil O\u2019Brien, who will be number two in the education team. Trott replaces Damian Hinds, who has been shadow education secretary since the general election. Hinds was education secretary between 2018 and 2019, and later served in government in more junior ministerial roles. Badenoch has already announced her chief whip, Rebecca Harris, and two party co-chairs, Nigel Huddlestone and Dominic Johnson. (See 9.38am.) Tom Bradshaw, president of the National Farmers\u2019 Union, has said that he has never known farmers to be as angry as they are about the changes to inheritance tax rules announced in the budget. And many \u201cwant to be militant\u201d, he said. He also said he does not accept government figures about the number of farming families that will be affected by the decision to apply inheritance tax to some farms. He was speaking after a meeting with Steve Reed, the environment secretary, and James Murray, a Treasury minister, about the issue. Last week the Treasury published a paper with figures purporting to show that 73% of farms would not be covered by the decision to apply inheritance tax to farms worth more than \u00a31m. But, speaking to PA Media after his meeting, Bradshaw said: So, the Treasury is saying only 27% of farms will be within scope of these changes. [Defra, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\u2019] own figures suggest that two-thirds of farms will be in scope. How they can have that wide a discrepancy within government is quite unbelievable. Bradshaw said Reed ruled out a change to the inheritance tax rules for farms before the election, and he said the decision was \u201ccompletely unfair\u201d. He went on: I have never seen the weight of support, the strength of feeling and anger that there is in this industry today. Many of them want to be militant. Now we are not encouraging that in any way shape or form but government need to understand that there is a real strength of feeling behind what this change means for the future of family farming in this country. Bradshaw also said today\u2019s meeting did not resolve the issue. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait to hear from government and Treasury and see if we can get to a resolution,\u201d he added. Kemi Badenoch has told staff at the Conservative party\u2019s HQ that they should experiment with doing things in new ways, according to the Guido Fawkes website. The website, which has good links with CCHQ, says Badenoch told staff that they could win the next election, that they should focus on principles, not policies (\u201cfreedom of speech, freedom of association, free enterprise, personal responsibility \u2013 what distinguishes us from all the parties of the left who think more government is the answer to everything\u201d) and that they should be willing to innovate. Don\u2019t have to do things they way they\u2019ve always been done. Time to try something different. Let your creative juices flow. Keir Starmer ended his speech to the Interpol general assembly by saying that, if together they could tackle the problem of people smuggling, that would be as important as what was achived at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow. He said: It\u2019s your collective efforts that bring organised criminals to justice wherever they seek to hide, and it\u2019s your leadership today that can help make a decisive breakthrough against this vile trade in human life. Because if together we could win this war against the people smugglers, then this gathering will have achieved a victory for humanity every bit as significant as the Glasgow climate pact, because you will have helped to smash the gangs, secure our borders and save countless lives. Starmer went on to say the government was \u201cgoing to treat people smugglers like terrorists\u201d. And he explained what that meant. So we\u2019re taking our approach to counter terrorism, which we know works, and apply it to the gangs with our new Border Security Command. We\u2019re ending the fragmentation between policing, Border Force and our intelligence agencies, recruiting hundreds of specialist investigators, the best of the best, from our National Crime Agency, Border Force, immigration enforcement and the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] and our intelligence agencies, all working together. We are making border protection an elite Border Force, and not just within our country. We\u2019re also working together with international partners, sharing intelligence and tactics. Earlier this year, I visited the headquarters of our National Crime Agency. I saw first hand the ways we are already collaborating and what it takes to intercept, to disrupt and destroy these networks. There are so many tools at our disposal. We could seize their phones at the border, identifying and tracing smugglers wiring payments. We\u2019ve already trained sniffer dogs to detect the smell of dinghy rubber and, working with Bulgaria, stopped more than 100 small boats upstream long before they made it to the Channel. And as we understand how these gangs work, we can invest in new capabilities and enhance powers to smash them. So we\u2019re giving our new Border Security Command an additional \u00a375m pounds of new funding, on top of the \u00a375m pounds we have already committed. This will support a new organized Immigration Crime Intelligence Unit, hundreds of new investigators and intelligence officers, backed by state of the art technology. We are also investing a further \u00a358m pounds in our National Crime Agency, including strengthening its data analysis and intelligence capabilities. And we\u2019ll also legislate to give those fighting these gangs enhanced powers too. Starmer said this approach worked with counter-terrorism operations. We have the powers to trace suspects\u2019 movements using information from the intelligence services. We can shut down their bank accounts, cut off their internet access, and arrest them for making preparations to act before an attack has taken place. We don\u2019t wait for them to act. We stop them before they act. And we need to stop people smuggling gangs before they act, too. Starmer said the world needs to wake up to the severity of the threat posed by illegal migration. (See 9.13am.) And he says he would work with \u201canyone serious\u201d to address the problem. I will work with anyone serious who could offer solutions of this, anyone, because without coordinated global action, it will not go away. And unless we bring all the powers we have to bear on this in much the same way as we do for terrorism, then we will struggle to bring these criminals to justice. And that, in a sense, is my message here today; people smuggling should be viewed as a global security threat similar to terrorism. We\u2019ve got to combine resources, share intelligence and tactics and tackle the problem upstream, working together to shut down the smuggling routes. We do that with terrorism. When I was the director of public prosecutions, it was my personal mission to smash the terrorist gangs, and we worked across borders to ensure the safety of citizens across Europe and across the world. Now, as the UK\u2019s prime minister, it is my personal mission to smash the people smuggling gangs. Starmer said that the new government was adopting this approach. Instead of \u201cgimmicks\u201d and \u201cgesture politics\u201d, it was \u201capproaching this issue with humanity and with profound respect for international law\u201d. And it would not withdraw from the European convention on human rights, he said. Starmer told the Interpol general assembly that that UK increasing its funding for Interpol projects by \u00a36m this year. He said this would include \u201csupport for improved data sharing and faster communications capabilities, the first ever global fraud threat assessment and new regional networks, from strengthening cooperation across the Pacific to tackling drug and gun smuggling networks in the Caribbean\u201d. Keir Starmer is speaking now at the Interpol conference in Glasgow. He started from stressing the importance of international cooperation in the fight against crime. He knew this from his time as director of public prosecutions, he said. Crime is global. Criminals do not respect borders. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, has said the concept of reparations for former British colonies affected by slavery should not be about cash payments. Speaking to the BBC in Nigeria, where he is starting a tour of African countries, he said the reparations concept \u201cis not about the transfer of cash\u201d. At the recent Commonwealth summit, Keir Starmer\u2019s reluctance to talk about reparations led to complaints from other leaders who said the UK should be doing more to address the ongoing problems linked to the legacy of slavery. No 10 has ruled out cash reparations, even though when Lammy was a backbench MP he did express support for the idea. Lammy told the BBC in Nigera that reparations were not about money, \u201cparticularly at a time of a cost of living crisis\u201d. Instead, the government is interested in other forms of reparatory justice. Sir James Dyson, the entrepreneur, has written an article for the Times today accusing the government of \u201cspiteful\u201d changes to inheritance tax rules. Farmers are furious because farms used to be exempt from inheritance tax, but under changes announced in the budget the 100% agricultural property relief (the exemption) will no longer apply on farms worth more than \u00a31m. The government is also changing the rules on business property relief, which means that some shares in family businesses will no longer be exempt from inheritance tax. In his article, Dyson condemns this as a \u201c20% family death tax\u201d and he claims this will lead to \u201cthe very fabric of our economy\u201d being ripped apart. Pointing out that there are almost five million family firms in the UK, he says: It beggars belief that Labour proudly boasts of trying to attract foreign investment, while at the same time eviscerating homegrown businesses. [Chancellor Rachel] Reeves killing off business property relief (originally introduced by a Labour government in 1976 and reinforced by the Brown government with entrepreneurs\u2019 relief) means that British families are landed with an unpayable tax bill every time an owner dies. Yet companies operating here but owned by overseas families won\u2019t have to pay Labour\u2019s tax. Private equity-owned firms won\u2019t pay. Public companies listed on stock markets won\u2019t pay. No, it is just homegrown, British family companies that will pay. This is a tragedy. Make no mistake, the very fabric of our economy is being ripped apart. No business can survive Reeves\u2019s 20 per cent tax grab. It will be the death of entrepreneurship. Think of the jobs for \u201cworking people\u201d that will be lost \u2014 or never created \u2026 Every business expects to pay tax, but for Labour to kill off homegrown family businesses is a tragedy. In particular, I have huge empathy for the small businesses and start-ups that will suffer. Labour has shown its true colours with a spiteful budget. It detests the private sector and has chosen to kill off individual aspiration and economic growth. Dyson became a billionaire through the firm selling his eponymous vacuum cleaner and other inventions, but he also has a large farming business (36,000 acres) in the UK. In his article he acknowledges that his family would lose out from Labour tax changes, but he does not say by how much. In an interview with Times Radio, asked about Dyson\u2019s article, Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, said she \u201cclearly\u201d disagreed with his claim that Labour hated the private sector. She said the budget involved \u201cdifficult\u2019\u201d decisions, but that they were necessary. I think this was a budget that had to do three things. It had to deal with the public finance chaos that we inherited and had to put the public finances back on track. That\u2019s fixing the foundations as Rachel has described it. Also make sure that we\u2019ve got plans to boost growth for the future \u2026 And then thirdly, to make sure that we can start to repair the deep damage to our public services and particularly our national health service, which I am deeply worried about. In order to do all of those things and to deal with that inherited chaos that we had, that has meant some difficult decisions, including on employers\u2019 national insurance contributions. But it\u2019s also been done in a way to protect people\u2019s pay slips and you\u2019ve got no increase in the national insurance for employees. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, has been doing an interview round this morning ahead of the PM\u2019s speech to the Interpol general assembly later. In an interview with LBC, she condemned the Labour MP Dawn Butler for sharing a tweet describing Kemi Badenoch as \u201cthe most prominent member of white supremacy\u2019s black collaborator class\u201d. Cooper said she had not seen the tweet, which Butler quickly deleted. But she said: The words that you have read out are clearly appalling and I would strongly disagree with them. So, I haven\u2019t seen the post. I don\u2019t know the circumstances around it but I think we should congratulate Kemi Badenoch on her election. I will continue to disagree with her on all sorts of issues, but, nevertheless, I congratulate her on her election. Asked if Butler should be disciplined by the party over the tweet, Cooper said that was a matter for the whip. Archie Bland has a good summary of the challenges facing Kemi Badenoch in his First Edition newsletter. Kemi Badenoch, the new Conservative leader, has already made some appointment. Rebecca Harris has become the new chief whip. This was announced yesterday, but the outgoing chief whip, Stuart Andrew, who posted these on social media. It has been an honour and a privilege to serve as the Conservative Party Chief Whip. @RebeccaHarrisMP is a great friend and a brilliant Whip. I wish her all the best in the role. I would like to thank the Whips and the MP\u2019s that have helped the Whip\u2019s Office for their dedication and assistance in helping me steady the ship over the past three months. At an uncertain time for our Party it has been challenging at times, but we have kept the show on the road and had some great successes. And Badenoch has appointed two Conservative co-chairs, PA Media reports. They are Nigel Huddleston, a former Treasury minister, and Dominic Johnson, a hedge fund manager (he ran an investment firm with Jacob Rees-Mogg) who was given a peerage and made a business minister when Liz Truss was PM. It is normal for the Conservative party to have two co-chairs \u2013 one an MP, focusing on presentation and party management, and another focusing on fund raising. Often a new opposition leader announces the new shadow chancellor first but, as Dan Bloom explains in his London Playbook briefing for Politico, there is a reason why it makes sense to start with choosing a new chief whip. News that Badenoch had appointed Rebecca Harris as chief whip emerged because Harris will be helping Badenoch make the other appointments, two people tell Playbook. One said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of knowledge in the whips\u2019 function as the HR department of the party \u2014 who\u2019s reliable, who turns up, who is a good colleague.\u201d Best behaviour! \u201cWho\u2019s reliable, who turns up, who is a good colleague?\u201d Badenoch should find out what the Tory whips used to say about her. As Eleni Courea reports, on these criteria, some of her colleagues would not rate her highly. Good morning. Interpol, the International Criminal Police Organisation, which has 196 member countries, has a general assembly and, for the first time in 50 years, it is meeting in Britain. Keir Starmer will address the meeting in Glasgow and he is going to deliver a \u201cwake up\u201d call on illegal migration, saying that the world needs to face up to the scale of the problem and that tackling the problem needs to be internationalised. Britain cannot do it on its own, he implies. According to extracts from the speech released in advance, Starmer will say: The world needs to wake up to the severity of this challenge. I was elected to deliver security for the British people. And strong borders are a part of that. But security doesn\u2019t stop at our borders. There\u2019s nothing progressive about turning a blind eye as men, women and children die in the channel. This is a vile trade that must be stamped out \u2013 wherever it thrives. So we\u2019re taking our approach to counter-terrorism - which we know works, and applying it to the gangs, with our new Border Security Command. We\u2019re ending the fragmentation between policing, Border Force and our intelligence agencies. In the headline of its news release, No 10 describes people smuggling as a \u201cnational security threat\u201d. Rajeev Syal has a full preview of the speech here. You might think some of this language might appeal to the Conservatives. Like Starmer, Kemi Badenoch, the new opposition leader, also believes that the previous government failed on illegal migration. But the Tories are saying Labour\u2019s approach will not work because there is no deterrent. Badenoch is appointing a shadow cabinet today, and so there is no proper shadow home secretary in place this morning (James Cleverly is stepping down), but last night CCHQ put out this statement from a party spokesperson. Keir Starmer\u2019s announcement on tackling gangs will mean absolutely nothing without a deterrent to stop migrants wishing to make the dangerous journey across the channel. It is a shame that Starmer has not recognised the extent of the crisis in the channel sooner, as he and the Labour party voted against numerous measures to stop the gangs while they were in opposition. If Starmer continues to ignore the need for a deterrent to stop migrants crossing the channel, there will be more deaths in the channel as more and more migrants continue to cross it, he needs to get a grip of the crisis in the channel. (Some experts in this field prefer to use the term irregular migration, not illegal migration, to describe people crossing the Channel in small boats because claiming asylum is not illegal under international law and, even though UK law says it is an offence to enter the country without proper authorisation, people who claim asylum don\u2019t get prosecuted. But the government is using the term illegal migration, as the previous government did.) Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Kemi Badenoch, the new Conservative leader, is due to meet party staff at CCHQ this morning. She will also be working on shadow cabinet appointments. 11am: Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, is speaking at the Interpol conference in Glasgow, ahead of Keir Starmer who is delivering a speech too. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. Morning: Steve Reed, the environment secretary, is due to meet the NFU leader Tom Bradshaw to discuss the budget plans to ensure that some farms are subject will be subject to inheritance tax. 2.30pm: Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 3.30pm: Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, is opening for the government in the resumed budget debate.

Latest analysis: Nationally, Harris has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over her Republican opponent, virtually identical to last week. Such an advantage is well with the margin of errors of most polls. The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat. But in a fractured political landscape that has featured threats of retribution from Trump, accusations of fascism and racism from Harris, and warnings that democracy itself is on the ballot, the bigger picture \u2013 that uniformity, over a prolonged period \u2013 has seasoned observers scratching their heads. \u2013 Robert Tait, 2 November Read more Notes on data To calculate our polling averages, Guardian US took a combination of head-to-head and multi-candidate polls and calculated a rolling 10-day average for each candidate. Our tracker uses polls gathered by 538 and filters out lower-quality pollsters for national polls. Our state polling averages use a lower quality threshold for inclusion due to the small numbers of state polls. If there were no polls over the the 10-day period, we leave the average blank. On 11 Oct Guardian US began rounding averages to the nearest whole number to better reflect the lack of certainty in the polling figures. Polling averages capture how the race stands at a particular moment in time and are likely to change as the election gets closer. Averages from states with small numbers of polls are also more susceptible to errors and biases. Our averages are an estimate of the support that the candidates have in key swing states and on the national stage. The election is decided by the electoral college, so these averages should not be taken as a likelihood of winning the election in November.

      "bodyText": "Arne Slot has said Mohamed Salah can sustain a world-class level like Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, and it is more important how the Liverpool forward plays than what he writes on social media. Salah moved into outright eighth on the all-time Premier League goalscorers\u2019 list with a stunning, trademark finish against Brighton on Saturday. It was the 164th goal of Salah\u2019s Premier League career and ninth of the season so far in all competitions. On Sunday the striker, who is out of contract with Liverpool at the end of this season, posted a message on X that said: \u201cNo matter what happens, I will never forget what scoring at Anfield feels like.\u201d Slot insists he has not spoken to the 32-year-old about a post that is open to interpretation but he believes the Egypt international can continue delivering at the highest level beyond the duration of his current deal. \u201cThere is no reason at the moment to think that he is dropping in terms of level,\u201d said Liverpool\u2019s head coach. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you see when you look at his numbers or what you see when he plays. I don\u2019t know how to say this in English, but I cannot tell you how the future will look like. \u201cCristiano Ronaldo, what age is he at the moment? [39]. Messi is still incredible [at 37]. But there are also players like me who weren\u2019t as good any more at 33, not that I was so good at 26. I don\u2019t know what the future brings but I do know Mo is in a very good place.\u201d The Premier League leaders host Xabi Alonso\u2019s Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League on Tuesday. Slot claims his only conversations with Salah this week have centred on that game, not his social media activity, but accepts contract-related speculation that also applies to Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold will rumble on until their futures with the club are resolved. \u201cYou interpreted it in a way that maybe other people don\u2019t,\u201d replied Slot when asked about the possible warning in Salah\u2019s post. \u201cI don\u2019t look at Instagram posts of my players, I only talk to them, which you can\u2019t, which is the advantage I have. I am hoping he will make another post after tomorrow and again after Saturday. What he said with that is not important. For me what is important is how he plays and what he tells me when we have conversations.

Prominent farming figures James Dyson and Jeremy Clarkson have come out against the tax change. But some experts including tax policy writer Dan Neidle and Paul Johnson from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said it would be a good idea to close the loophole.</p> <p>However, the Treasury numbers the analysis is based on are being questioned. The chancellor last week claimed that 72% of farms would be unaffected. The NFU argues that cash-poor, medium-sized family farms will be unaffordably hit if the rate remains at \u00a31m, and pointed to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/balance-sheet-analysis-and-farming-performance-england/balance-sheet-analysis-and-farming-performance-england-202223-statistics-notice\">Defra figures</a>, which it said indicated that the true percentage of farms affected by the APR changes will be 66%.</p> <p>The Treasury\u2019s assumption was based on former claims for APR but many assets on farmland were claimed for under a separate inheritance tax relief scheme \u2013 BPR, according to the union, and the new regime joins these schemes together. The NFU said that the Treasury has therefore undervalued many of the UK\u2019s farms and the Defra data is more accurate. This data was worked out recently when farms were applying for subsidy after the UK left the EU farm payments system and they had to register their value and size with Defra.</p> <p>Bradshaw said the Treasury and Defra agreed in the meeting to go away and come up with the \u201ctrue figure\u201d.</p> <p>Bradshaw said farmers were furious after Reed promised before the budget that there would be no changes to APR, so businesses were unable to prepare for the shock.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/01/farmers-shocked-budget-inheritance-tax-estates\">\u2018It\u2019s massive\u2019: farmers shocked at budget \u2013 but is concern over inheritance tax overblown?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He told journalists on Monday: \u201cThey do not understand the immediate impacts this having to intergenerational farms. Some very, very concerned successful businesses have a parent involved who is in their 80s but the person running the farm is in their 50s. The assets are still in the ownership of the older family member. We have seen some in ill health who will not live seven years to utilise the gifting rules. It is unbelievable the pressure they are putting on the industry. To make this change now, to rip the rug out from under the farming industry, I don\u2019t see how they can justify it.\u201d</p> <p>The NFU usually advises its members not to protest but Bradshaw warned that \u201cmilitant\u201d action may be taken over this.</p> <p>\u201cThe outrage from rural communities is like nothing we have ever seen before. They are talking about militant action. We\u2019ve always said, don\u2019t protest, but we can\u2019t say to people don\u2019t do that now. We will be doing our mass lobby for people who have a meeting with a constituency MP but I know others are doing other things,\u201d he said, adding that 190,000 people have signed a petition against the changes.</p> <p>The NFU policy chief, Nick von Westenholz, explained: \u201cIn a very best-case scenario with spouses using all of their allowances it\u2019s true they can claim up to \u00a33m but in most instances that will not be the case. Not all farm business owners are married. One of the spouses could have other assets which use up the \u00a31m threshold. So it is not a reasonable figure to say that it will be available for most farms. Good policy should be based on the reasonable worst case scenarios rather than best case scenario\u201d.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe understand concerns about changes to Agricultural Property Relief and the Defra secretary of state and exchequer secretary to the Treasury met with NFU president Tom Bradshaw today. Ministers made clear that the vast majority of those claiming relief will not be affected by these changes. They will be able to pass the family farm down to their children just as previous generations have always done.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a fair and balanced approach that protects the family farm while also fixing the public services that we all rely on. We remain committed to working with the NFU and listening to farmers.\u201d</p>",

But some experts including tax policy writer Dan Neidle and Paul Johnson from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said it would be a good idea to close the loophole. However, the Treasury numbers the analysis is based on are being questioned. The chancellor last week claimed that 72% of farms would be unaffected. The NFU argues that cash-poor, medium-sized family farms will be unaffordably hit if the rate remains at \u00a31m, and pointed to Defra figures, which it said indicated that the true percentage of farms affected by the APR changes will be 66%. The Treasury\u2019s assumption was based on former claims for APR but many assets on farmland were claimed for under a separate inheritance tax relief scheme \u2013 BPR, according to the union, and the new regime joins these schemes together. The NFU said that the Treasury has therefore undervalued many of the UK\u2019s farms and the Defra data is more accurate. This data was worked out recently when farms were applying for subsidy after the UK left the EU farm payments system and they had to register their value and size with Defra. Bradshaw said the Treasury and Defra agreed in the meeting to go away and come up with the \u201ctrue figure\u201d. Bradshaw said farmers were furious after Reed promised before the budget that there would be no changes to APR, so businesses were unable to prepare for the shock. He told journalists on Monday: \u201cThey do not understand the immediate impacts this having to intergenerational farms. Some very, very concerned successful businesses have a parent involved who is in their 80s but the person running the farm is in their 50s. The assets are still in the ownership of the older family member. We have seen some in ill health who will not live seven years to utilise the gifting rules. It is unbelievable the pressure they are putting on the industry. To make this change now, to rip the rug out from under the farming industry, I don\u2019t see how they can justify it.\u201d The NFU usually advises its members not to protest but Bradshaw warned that \u201cmilitant\u201d action may be taken over this. \u201cThe outrage from rural communities is like nothing we have ever seen before. They are talking about militant action. We\u2019ve always said, don\u2019t protest, but we can\u2019t say to people don\u2019t do that now. We will be doing our mass lobby for people who have a meeting with a constituency MP but I know others are doing other things,\u201d he said, adding that 190,000 people have signed a petition against the changes. The NFU policy chief, Nick von Westenholz, explained: \u201cIn a very best-case scenario with spouses using all of their allowances it\u2019s true they can claim up to \u00a33m but in most instances that will not be the case. Not all farm business owners are married. One of the spouses could have other assets which use up the \u00a31m threshold. So it is not a reasonable figure to say that it will be available for most farms. Good policy should be based on the reasonable worst case scenarios rather than best case scenario\u201d. A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe understand concerns about changes to Agricultural Property Relief and the Defra secretary of state and exchequer secretary to the Treasury met with NFU president Tom Bradshaw today. Ministers made clear that the vast majority of those claiming relief will not be affected by these changes. They will be able to pass the family farm down to their children just as previous generations have always done. \u201cThis is a fair and balanced approach that protects the family farm while also fixing the public services that we all rely on. We remain committed to working with the NFU and listening to farmers.\u201d",

There were, however, questions about whether Jenrick had initially sought another post, in a sign of potential tensions between the final two candidates to replace Rishi Sunak. The appointment of three MPs who ran against Badenoch in the leadership contest followed her decision to make Laura Trott, a leading supporter of her campaign, shadow education secretary. It remained unclear whether Jenrick\u2019s move to what could be seen as a mid-range shadow cabinet job was his first choice, after reports that he and Badenoch had been wrangling over his role. An ally of Jenrick said: \u201cRobert was always keen to serve.\u201d Badenoch had already appointed two other supporters to jobs, with Rebecca Harris becoming chief whip, and Nigel Huddlestone being made Conservative party co-chair alongside Dominic Johnson, a Tory peer and former donor. Neil O\u2019Brien, who had been widely tipped for a shadow cabinet job, was made number two in the education team, regarded by some observers as a slight snub for a supporter of Jenrick, who Badenoch defeated in a vote of Tory members, a result announced on Saturday. Allies of Badenoch said that no more appointments would be made on Monday, with the full list to be announced before a shadow cabinet meeting on Tuesday, to avoid a \u201crunning commentary\u201d as jobs were finalised. With only 121 MPs on the Tory benches \u2013 the full government complement is 124 \u2013 Badenoch will be somewhat limited on who she picks. This is all the more so with some senior Tories saying they do not want jobs. These include Jeremy Hunt, the former chancellor and shadow chancellor, and James Cleverly, the shadow home secretary who was favourite to become the next leader until he was surprisingly removed in the final vote among Tory MPs. Jenrick trained as a solicitor and worked as a corporate lawyer, and so has a suitable background for the justice brief. His last government job was as immigration minister, and he made migration and his desire for the UK to withdraw from the European convention on human rights the key part of his leadership bid. The contest included coded if personal attacks between Jenrick and Badenoch. He promised to \u201cend the drama\u201d, a reference to Badenoch\u2019s penchant for arguments, and was furious when she talked about Jenrick having to \u201cresign in disgrace\u201d as housing minister after a controversy about a planning-related conflict of interest. The appointment of Stride will be seen as a sign of Badenoch seeking to reach out to centrists in the party, particularly after Andrew Griffith, another one of her key supporters, had been closely linked to the job. Stride was one of six candidates to succeed Sunak as Tory leader, but was knocked out in the second round of voting by Conservative MPs. He then backed James Cleverly before Cleverly in turn was knocked out. Stride was work and pensions secretary under Rishi Sunak, having previously served as a Treasury minister and chaired the Treasury committee. Patel, who also stood to be leader but was knocked out in the first round, has had a chequered ministerial career, only surviving as home secretary when Boris Johnson refused to sack her despite a formal investigation finding evidence that she had bullied civil servants. The controversy, one of several to afflict Johnson\u2019s government, saw the then PM\u2019s adviser on ethics, Sir Alex Allan, resign after Johnson decided to keep Patel in her post despite an official report uncovering conduct that \u201camounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying\u201d, including instances of shouting and swearing. In 2017, Patel was forced to resign as international development secretary under Theresa May after holding a series of unofficial meetings with Israeli ministers, business people and a senior lobbyist while in Israel on what was billed as a holiday. A source in Badenoch\u2019s team said the decision to appoint the two former candidates from different wings of the party \u2013 Patel is from the right and Stride a centrist \u2013 was \u201cdemonstrating Kemi\u2019s desire to unite the party\u201d. Badenoch appointed Trott earlier on Monday, so she could speak at education questions and respond to a government statement on increased university tuition fees.",

She took her work seriously and, at her studio in St John\u2019s Wood, she experimented with a range of media and techniques. In 1985 she married Bill Blackburn, a lawyer, whom she had met through his wife Pitche. Shortly before Pitche\u2019s death from cancer, she encouraged Bill to \u201cmarry Chlo\u00eb!\u201d And so it came to pass. After Bill\u2019s death in 2002, Chlo\u00eb continued to sculpt and entertain family and friends until age and frailty began to slow her down. Chlo\u00eb is survived by her children, eight grandchildren, two great-grandchildren and Paul.",

Research into how drugs like LSD, MDMA and psilocybin can improve mental health continues to grow and evolve.

This summer, the FDA rejected MDMA-assisted therapy to treat PTSD. But as Ross Ellenhorn and Dimitri Mugianis, founders of the psychedelic program Cardea, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/17/psychedelic-drugs-benefits\">wrote in the Guardian in July</a>, thinking of psychedelics like pharmaceuticals may not be helpful. \u201cIt is a means of accessing an experience; it\u2019s not a medication,\u201d they wrote.</p> <h2>Underconsumption core</h2> <p>Is it \u201cunder-consuming\u201d or is it just living normally?

For the most part, we know how to do this: eat nutritious food, move your body, get adequate sleep, manage stress and nurture your relationships. But eating leafy greens, going on walks and journaling aren\u2019t terribly exciting. New trends that promise to revolutionize our health and wellbeing are more intriguing. Often, these trends are old ideas in shiny new packaging (eg detoxing). Sometimes, they are genuine advancements whose implications may not yet be fully understood (eg microbiome testing). It can be difficult to sort the wellness wheat from the chaff. Here are some of the biggest health and wellness trends of 2024 \u2013 so far \u2013 and what to make of them. Cortisol face The phrase \u201ccortisol face\u201d started popping up on TikTok this year as creators claimed that an oversupply of cortisol, the body\u2019s primary stress hormone, results in a puffy, \u201cugly\u201d face. Lower your cortisol, they argued, and your face would become more attractive. Cortisol can affect one\u2019s appearance, but not in the way wellness influencers casually suggest. According to experts, an excess of cortisol in the body can lead to Cushing\u2019s syndrome, a relatively rare condition that is most commonly the result of steroid treatments. Standard, day-to-day stress is unlikely to raise cortisol levels high enough. If you are worried about your cortisol levels, consult with a doctor \u2013 not TikTok. Red light therapy Initially used as an in-office tool, at-home red light therapy devices have surged in popularity, thanks to claims that they smooth wrinkles, heal acne and boost hair growth. But the products are still \u201can emerging therapeutic area\u201d, says Toronto dermatologist Dr Annie Liu. Anecdotally, many users report a boost in glow and radiance, but Dr Prem Tripathi, a facial plastic surgeon based in California, is more cautious. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a limit on what you see from using these devices,\u201d he says. Think of them as a maintenance tool best used between in-office treatments. Lately, some TikTok users have tried to use red Christmas lights or heat lamps typically used in raising chickens, but those methods are unlikely to have any meaningful benefits. If you\u2019re going to invest time in red light therapy, a product from a reputable brand tested in third-party clinical trials will be your best bet. Magnesium Early this year, magnesium was a wellness buzzword on TikTok. Content creators claimed that ingesting magnesium supplements had helped reduce their feelings of anxiety. The mineral is crucial for the body to function, and research suggests that it can help inhibit stress and have an overall calming effect. But more research is needed to fully understand its effects.

Raw milk Another craze that bubbled up from the depths of social media this year was raw milk, or milk that has not been pasteurized. Adherents claimed that raw milk has more vitamins and minerals than milk that has been pasteurized; the CDC disputes this. Demand has grown so much in the United States that over two dozen states have legalized the sale of raw milk.

At-home microbiome testing kits Perhaps your Instagram feed, like mine, has recently become saturated with ads for at-home microbiome testing kits. Many of the companies selling these kits \u2013 which cost anywhere from $120 to $400 \u2013 claim that, by analyzing a customer\u2019s stool sample, they can provide personalized diet recommendations which will help one manage conditions like anxiety, joint pain and low energy. Experts agree that the gut microbiome is important to human health. But many experts also agree that it is not yet possible to draw meaningful conclusions from microbiome data, and that most of these companies can\u2019t possibly deliver on the big promises they make. As one researcher told the Guardian, these tests are currently a useful diagnostic tool for a \u201climited number of conditions\u201d like Crohn\u2019s disease and type 2 diabetes, but using them to make diet recommendations is \u201cexceedingly difficult\u201d. Aura points On TikTok, users have been calculating the strength of their auras \u2013 a nebulous term describing one\u2019s energy and charisma, or \u201crizz,\u201d to use the contemporary parlance \u2013 using \u201caura points\u201d. As reporter Alaina Demopoulos explained in July, \u201cwinning aura points typically comes from acting in a breezy and unbothered but self-confident way\u201d, while one loses aura points by being cringey and insecure.

Companies and researchers are focusing on topics like how patients might be able to consume psychedelics without tripping in order to treat depression, and how psilocybin might be able to help terminal cancer patients come to terms with death. It\u2019s not all smooth sailing though. This summer, the FDA rejected MDMA-assisted therapy to treat PTSD. But as Ross Ellenhorn and Dimitri Mugianis, founders of the psychedelic program Cardea, wrote in the Guardian in July, thinking of psychedelics like pharmaceuticals may not be helpful. \u201cIt is a means of accessing an experience; it\u2019s not a medication,\u201d they wrote. Underconsumption core Is it \u201cunder-consuming\u201d or is it just living normally? A number of TikTok creators have begun to push back against the culture of purchasing and flaunting material goods, instead espousing \u201cunderconsumption core\u201d. While other \u201ccores\u201d are generally associated with certain aesthetics and acquiring particular clothes or other products, this trend encourages reusing, upcycling and reducing waste. Critics note that this is not unusual for most people. \u201cA lot of people are responding [to the trend] by saying this is what it\u2019s like being working class,\u201d Georgina Johnson, editor and environmentalist, told the Guardian in August. It can still be a positive message, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just about how it\u2019s contextualized and who is given visibility around it.\u201d Skincare for kids The skincare market is booming, and according to some reports, the rise is due in part to gen Alpha \u2013 those born between 2010 and 2024. This year, parents and dermatologists reported that children as young as nine were adopting complex, multi-step skincare regimens, and using their holiday wishlists to ask for eye creams and anti-ageing serums. Some of this can be attributed to the experimentation and identity formation that are a normal part of tweens\u2019 and teens\u2019 development. Experts warn that a fear of ageing and a focus on unrealistic beauty standards can be harmful to a child\u2019s mental health. Not to mention the risks to their skin. \u201cMost tweens have few, if any, skin concerns and so the use of these products can result in irritation and often cause skin conditions like periorificial dermatitis,\u201d Dr Shreya Andric, a dermatologist, told the Guardian. Digital detoxing While smartphones have become a staple of modern life, more individuals and organizations are reexamining their relationships with them. Some people are undertaking digital detoxes, or trading in their smartphones for \u201cdumb phones\u201d \u2013 old school flip phones with no email or distracting apps. In the US, some schools are banning smartphones and seeing tremendous results. There is still some debate over just how bad for us our phones really are. But lots of people want to use their phones less or at least more mindfully. At the beginning of this year, the Guardian launched the Reclaim Your Brain newsletter to help people spend less time on their phones. Over 100,000 readers signed up in under three months. In a March survey, subscribers said they cut their overall screen time by 40%. \u201cI\u2019m reading more books, doing more chores and sleeping better,\u201d one respondent said. Voluntary celibacy, or being \u2018boysober\u2019 Maybe you haven\u2019t encountered the term \u201cboysober,\u201d but you\u2019ve probably come across its nongendered synonym: celibacy. In February, a woman told the New York Times it was \u201cthis year\u2019s hottest mental health craze\u201d. A few months later, actress Julia Fox revealed she had been celibate for over two years. In the spring, dating app Bumble issued an apology after its anti-celibacy ad campaign received widespread backlash. This movement \u2013 of largely, but not exclusively, heterosexual women \u2013 comes amid a broader alleged \u201csex recession\u201d. Some of this disinterest in sex has been attributed to dating app fatigue. Others see it as a reimagining of sexual politics and dynamics. Egg freezing Fertility clinics in the US and UK have seen huge increases in the number of patients freezing their eggs. In the US, this rise is due in part to an increase in the number of employers who offer fertility treatment benefits that cover the massive costs of the procedure. These services can offer a sense of freedom and security, a way for those who use them to make decisions about their lives without feeling pressured by their \u201cbiological clocks.\u201d Still, egg freezing is not a guarantee, one fertility clinic doctor told the Guardian: for those over 35 who are able to retrieve 20 eggs, the chance of pregnancy is 50%. For those with 5 eggs, it\u2019s 6%. Finding sperm for one\u2019s eggs presents its own challenges. And even if all goes smoothly, social and professional support for parents is often lacking.",

      "body": "<p>In Fulton county, Georgia, they\u2019re on guard for efforts to undermine democracy from Republican members of the state elections board. In Luzerne county, Pennsylvania, they\u2019re defending themselves as conspiracy theories swirl. And in Cochise county, Arizona, they\u2019re preparing to certify the results shortly after one of their colleagues pleaded guilty to refusing to do so in the last election.</p> <p>Election officials are the first line of defense for democracy this election \u2013 and their job is anything but easy.</p> <p>For years, they have worked in relative obscurity as they administered the vote in a non-partisan way. But Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election unleashed a wave of harassment and pressure on these officials never seen before. Many have chosen to leave the profession, and those that have stuck around find themselves in a job that looks dramatically different from the low-profile one they once held.</p> <p>The Guardian has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/the-election-office\">following five election offices</a> across the country for the last year, examining how staff turnover, election denialism and misinformation have affected their work, mental health and physical safety.</p> <p>On the eve of election day, we checked in with the officials, many in swing states, who will be working around the clock to ensure that all votes are counted.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Fulton </strong><strong>county, Georgia</strong></h2> <p>Sheri Allen and Julie Adams rhetorically circled each other at the election board meeting like boxers in a ring.</p> <p>Allen, chairperson of the Fulton county board of registration and elections, and Adams, one of two recalcitrant Republican members of the board, were negotiating terms for which election documents Adams could inspect over the next week or two.</p> <p>But really, they were probing each other for an angle \u2013 some hidden danger or exposed weakness or intent behind their words.</p> <p>\u201cI can see where this conversation is going,\u201d Adams said at the board meeting last Wednesday, \u201cbut I want to renew the request that I have made, and I would like to see the reports from poll watchers, poll workers and voters that have had issues, complaints or comments, and how we react.\u201d</p> <p>Allen is a personal injury attorney and approached Adams\u2019s inquiries like a lawyer might. The two sparred over how to define a problem that should rise to the board\u2019s notice, about whether Adams could have an electronic copy of the list of voters who had cast ballots in Fulton county \u2013 in order of their vote, by precinct \u2013 and whether she could be physically present as election workers popped the seals on the boxes of early vote ballots on election day.</p> <p>Under other conditions, Adams\u2019s request to get reports in real time about problems at polling locations, or a list of voters who had cast a ballot, would raise no alarms.</p> <p>In Fulton county, the alarms never stop.</p> <p>After the 2020 election in Georgia, Trump and others issued florid and extravagant lies about Fulton county and the conduct of its poll workers. Though recounts showed that the election was fair and accurate, every error made by the county has been amplified by conservative partisans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/29/georgia-election-swing-state\">\u2018I\u2019ve lost friends\u2019: in bitterly divided Georgia, can Democrats score another win?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>County elections officials have been in a state of hyper-vigilance ever since, wondering which mistake might draw the heavens down upon them, or from which rock the next fountain of misinformation will spring.</p> <p>\u201cWith all that is on the line for this election, why would we keep throwing in additional new ways of doing things?\u201d asked board vice-chairperson Aaron Johnson. \u201cI\u2019m on the record today; this is going to cause chaos. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s intentional.\u201d</p> <p>Adams, who works for a Trump-aligned group, sued the county earlier this year seeking a ruling to establish that she and other elections board members in Georgia had the legal right to refuse to certify an election if they think it didn\u2019t meet their standards. A judge rejected that position, ruling instead that certification is a ministerial act mandated by the Georgia constitution.</p> <p>But Judge Robert McBurney also ruled that Adams has a right to review documents in advance of the certification vote, though a second judge in a separate case ruled that counties are not obligated to provide volumes of poll data and administrative paperwork to elections superintendents.</p> <p>At the board meeting on Wednesday, Adams\u2019s request to have an electronic copy of the voter list was denied in a 3-2 vote. Allen cited security considerations. Instead, the county will make a hard paper copy available for her review, no phone recording allowed. If the elections director has to send a report to the secretary of state\u2019s office about a polling problem, the board will get a note too. And Adams will be able to watch the first ballots come out of the box for counting at 2pm sharp on election day.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Cochise </strong><strong>county, Arizona</strong></h2> <p>In rural Cochise county, Arizona, a Republican haven along the US-Mexico border, there are Democratic candidates running for the three open county supervisor seats and a recorder position \u2013 something that hasn\u2019t happened in recent memory.</p> <p>The Democratic activation came after several years of rampant election denialism culminated in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/29/arizona-officials-charged-election-2022\">criminal charges</a> against two supervisors who initially refused to certify the county\u2019s election results in 2022. Those charges followed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/15/arizona-2022-midterm-election-subversion\">attempts to hand-count</a> ballots and after an experienced elections director <a href=\"https://theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/26/arizona-elections-director-conchise-county-lisa-marra\">quit over a hostile work environment</a>. The county is on its fifth elections director since 2022.</p> <p>\u201cI think it speaks volumes to the frustration that people have with their local government,\u201d said Elisabeth Tyndall, the chair of the local Democratic party, that \u201cpeople were willing to step up and run for those seats, even in light of all of the chaos\u201d.</p> <p>One of the supervisors, Peggy Judd, recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/21/peggy-judd-pleads-guilty-arizona-election-denier\">agreed to a plea deal</a>, accepting a misdemeanor charge that brings probation and a fine. The other supervisor, Tom Crosby, hasn\u2019t done the same \u2013 and he refused to vote to certify the 2022 results even after a court required the county to do so.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. <a href=\"https://app.adjust.com/w4u7jx3\">Get our free app</a> and sign up for election alerts</strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Tyndall said, despite the upheaval, she trusts the elections department to carry out a successful election. About 100 ballots in one precinct were missing a supervisor\u2019s race, an <a href=\"https://www.azfamily.com/2024/10/24/cochise-county-election-officials-say-ballots-some-voters-didnt-include-key-race/\">error</a> that the county rectified by sending corrected ballots to those affected and having some on hand on election day at the polls. It was a \u201cfixable mistake\u201d that Tyndall said the county remedied fairly.</p> <p>Still, the specter of refusing to certify looms over the 2024 results \u2013 as jurisdictions around the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/11/arizona-2022-election-interference-trial\">toy with the idea</a> of whether they have to sign off on election results, a non-discretionary task. Judd\u2019s probation lasts through the certification, and prosecutors said that timing was intentional to ideally prevent a repeat of 2022. Crosby, who has been the more vocal elections critic, hasn\u2019t indicated his plans.</p> <p>\u201cHonestly, it will be very difficult for them to not certify,\u201d Tyndall said.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Hillsdale </strong><strong>county, Michigan</strong></h2> <p>Abe Dane is hoping for the best but preparing for the worst.</p> <p>Dane, who administers elections in Hillsdale county, Michigan, has spent the last four years challenging the election-related disinformation and conspiracy theories that have taken hold in his conservative community all while getting ready to run his first presidential election.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not a heavily staffed office, and most of our staff are dealing with everything outside of elections,\u201d said Dane. \u201cSo it\u2019s a lot, but I have a wonderful group of township and city clerks that I\u2019m very close with.\u201d</p>    <p>This year, Dane has full confidence in the local election officials running the show in the small towns and cities that make up Hillsdale county. That wasn\u2019t always the case.</p> <p>In 2020, the clerk in Adams Township was drawn into Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the presidential election. Scott didn\u2019t only accept Trump\u2019s claims of a stolen election. She believed Michigan\u2019s presidential election had been corrupted by nefarious forces in favor of Joe Biden, who many in Hillsdale county could not believe won the 2020 election. Egging her on was Stefanie Lambert, a Michigan lawyer who in the wake of the 2020 election took on numerous cases challenging the results.</p> <p>After the election, the state of Michigan alleges Scott and Lambert illegally turned over private voter data to an outside group in their search for fraud \u2013 for which they currently face multiple felony charges. When Scott refused to turn over voting equipment for mandatory maintenance, the state stripped her of her authority to administer elections in 2021. Two years later, voters ousted her in a recall election that was widely viewed as a test of the power of election denialism in the deep-red community.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/27/democrats-michigan-trump-fear\">Democrats in Michigan \u2018freaked out\u2019 by Trump \u2013 and trying to win swing state on a knife-edge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Scott, who challenged Dane in the Republican primary for the position overseeing elections in Hillsdale county, enjoys the support of a small but vocal coterie of activists who maintain their belief that the 2020 election was stolen. After Scott and a slate of so-called America First candidates lost their primary elections in August, Dane says the group has quieted down. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the flow of conspiracy theories, which he says \u201cdisseminate from the top down\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI still have people that I know, love and respect in my circles that believe some of the stuff, and I have to continually try and either bite my tongue, or if the opportunity presents itself, try and educate them on what the facts are,\u201d said Dane.</p> <p>Dane has been preparing security measures for months in advance of the election, coordinating with local law enforcement officials to continually monitor polling places on election day. But he says he is more concerned about the bread-and-butter of election administration \u2013 processing early and absentee ballots, helping poll workers adapt to new processes and technology, and preparing for inevitable human errors.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Luzerne </strong><strong>county, Pennsylvania</strong></h2> <p>Luzerne county, an industrial battleground in north-eastern Pennsylvania, is facing a wave of conspiracy theories on the eve of the election.</p> <p>In late October, the county was doing some routine shredding of documents. When someone spotted the truck for the shredding company in front of the county\u2019s office building, which also houses its election offices, it set off conspiracy theories. Romilda Crocamo, the county manager, quickly started hearing online that the county was shredding ballots, which of course wasn\u2019t true.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a conspiracy theory for everything,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is nothing that we can say or do that will convince the people who believe in conspiracies to change their minds. I feel badly for those people. I don\u2019t know how you live that way.\u201d</p> <p>Crocamo is also worried about violence. During the early voting period, she had to call a sheriff to the elections office because two people were fighting. Someone called a bureau employee a racial slur. Another person spit on an employee.</p> <p>She said the county was adding barriers to control traffic into the office.

      "bodyText": "In Fulton county, Georgia, they\u2019re on guard for efforts to undermine democracy from Republican members of the state elections board. In Luzerne county, Pennsylvania, they\u2019re defending themselves as conspiracy theories swirl. And in Cochise county, Arizona, they\u2019re preparing to certify the results shortly after one of their colleagues pleaded guilty to refusing to do so in the last election. Election officials are the first line of defense for democracy this election \u2013 and their job is anything but easy. For years, they have worked in relative obscurity as they administered the vote in a non-partisan way. But Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election unleashed a wave of harassment and pressure on these officials never seen before. Many have chosen to leave the profession, and those that have stuck around find themselves in a job that looks dramatically different from the low-profile one they once held. The Guardian has been following five election offices across the country for the last year, examining how staff turnover, election denialism and misinformation have affected their work, mental health and physical safety. On the eve of election day, we checked in with the officials, many in swing states, who will be working around the clock to ensure that all votes are counted. *** Fulton county, Georgia Sheri Allen and Julie Adams rhetorically circled each other at the election board meeting like boxers in a ring. Allen, chairperson of the Fulton county board of registration and elections, and Adams, one of two recalcitrant Republican members of the board, were negotiating terms for which election documents Adams could inspect over the next week or two. But really, they were probing each other for an angle \u2013 some hidden danger or exposed weakness or intent behind their words. \u201cI can see where this conversation is going,\u201d Adams said at the board meeting last Wednesday, \u201cbut I want to renew the request that I have made, and I would like to see the reports from poll watchers, poll workers and voters that have had issues, complaints or comments, and how we react.\u201d Allen is a personal injury attorney and approached Adams\u2019s inquiries like a lawyer might. The two sparred over how to define a problem that should rise to the board\u2019s notice, about whether Adams could have an electronic copy of the list of voters who had cast ballots in Fulton county \u2013 in order of their vote, by precinct \u2013 and whether she could be physically present as election workers popped the seals on the boxes of early vote ballots on election day. Under other conditions, Adams\u2019s request to get reports in real time about problems at polling locations, or a list of voters who had cast a ballot, would raise no alarms. In Fulton county, the alarms never stop. After the 2020 election in Georgia, Trump and others issued florid and extravagant lies about Fulton county and the conduct of its poll workers. Though recounts showed that the election was fair and accurate, every error made by the county has been amplified by conservative partisans. County elections officials have been in a state of hyper-vigilance ever since, wondering which mistake might draw the heavens down upon them, or from which rock the next fountain of misinformation will spring. \u201cWith all that is on the line for this election, why would we keep throwing in additional new ways of doing things?\u201d asked board vice-chairperson Aaron Johnson. \u201cI\u2019m on the record today; this is going to cause chaos. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s intentional.\u201d Adams, who works for a Trump-aligned group, sued the county earlier this year seeking a ruling to establish that she and other elections board members in Georgia had the legal right to refuse to certify an election if they think it didn\u2019t meet their standards. A judge rejected that position, ruling instead that certification is a ministerial act mandated by the Georgia constitution. But Judge Robert McBurney also ruled that Adams has a right to review documents in advance of the certification vote, though a second judge in a separate case ruled that counties are not obligated to provide volumes of poll data and administrative paperwork to elections superintendents. At the board meeting on Wednesday, Adams\u2019s request to have an electronic copy of the voter list was denied in a 3-2 vote. Allen cited security considerations. Instead, the county will make a hard paper copy available for her review, no phone recording allowed. If the elections director has to send a report to the secretary of state\u2019s office about a polling problem, the board will get a note too. And Adams will be able to watch the first ballots come out of the box for counting at 2pm sharp on election day. *** Cochise county, Arizona In rural Cochise county, Arizona, a Republican haven along the US-Mexico border, there are Democratic candidates running for the three open county supervisor seats and a recorder position \u2013 something that hasn\u2019t happened in recent memory. The Democratic activation came after several years of rampant election denialism culminated in criminal charges against two supervisors who initially refused to certify the county\u2019s election results in 2022. Those charges followed attempts to hand-count ballots and after an experienced elections director quit over a hostile work environment. The county is on its fifth elections director since 2022. \u201cI think it speaks volumes to the frustration that people have with their local government,\u201d said Elisabeth Tyndall, the chair of the local Democratic party, that \u201cpeople were willing to step up and run for those seats, even in light of all of the chaos\u201d. One of the supervisors, Peggy Judd, recently agreed to a plea deal, accepting a misdemeanor charge that brings probation and a fine. The other supervisor, Tom Crosby, hasn\u2019t done the same \u2013 and he refused to vote to certify the 2022 results even after a court required the county to do so. Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. Get our free app and sign up for election alerts Tyndall said, despite the upheaval, she trusts the elections department to carry out a successful election. About 100 ballots in one precinct were missing a supervisor\u2019s race, an error that the county rectified by sending corrected ballots to those affected and having some on hand on election day at the polls. It was a \u201cfixable mistake\u201d that Tyndall said the county remedied fairly. Still, the specter of refusing to certify looms over the 2024 results \u2013 as jurisdictions around the country toy with the idea of whether they have to sign off on election results, a non-discretionary task. Judd\u2019s probation lasts through the certification, and prosecutors said that timing was intentional to ideally prevent a repeat of 2022. Crosby, who has been the more vocal elections critic, hasn\u2019t indicated his plans. \u201cHonestly, it will be very difficult for them to not certify,\u201d Tyndall said. *** Hillsdale county, Michigan Abe Dane is hoping for the best but preparing for the worst. Dane, who administers elections in Hillsdale county, Michigan, has spent the last four years challenging the election-related disinformation and conspiracy theories that have taken hold in his conservative community all while getting ready to run his first presidential election. \u201cWe\u2019re not a heavily staffed office, and most of our staff are dealing with everything outside of elections,\u201d said Dane. \u201cSo it\u2019s a lot, but I have a wonderful group of township and city clerks that I\u2019m very close with.\u201d This year, Dane has full confidence in the local election officials running the show in the small towns and cities that make up Hillsdale county. That wasn\u2019t always the case. In 2020, the clerk in Adams Township was drawn into Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the presidential election. Scott didn\u2019t only accept Trump\u2019s claims of a stolen election. She believed Michigan\u2019s presidential election had been corrupted by nefarious forces in favor of Joe Biden, who many in Hillsdale county could not believe won the 2020 election. Egging her on was Stefanie Lambert, a Michigan lawyer who in the wake of the 2020 election took on numerous cases challenging the results. After the election, the state of Michigan alleges Scott and Lambert illegally turned over private voter data to an outside group in their search for fraud \u2013 for which they currently face multiple felony charges. When Scott refused to turn over voting equipment for mandatory maintenance, the state stripped her of her authority to administer elections in 2021. Two years later, voters ousted her in a recall election that was widely viewed as a test of the power of election denialism in the deep-red community. Scott, who challenged Dane in the Republican primary for the position overseeing elections in Hillsdale county, enjoys the support of a small but vocal coterie of activists who maintain their belief that the 2020 election was stolen. After Scott and a slate of so-called America First candidates lost their primary elections in August, Dane says the group has quieted down. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the flow of conspiracy theories, which he says \u201cdisseminate from the top down\u201d. \u201cI still have people that I know, love and respect in my circles that believe some of the stuff, and I have to continually try and either bite my tongue, or if the opportunity presents itself, try and educate them on what the facts are,\u201d said Dane. Dane has been preparing security measures for months in advance of the election, coordinating with local law enforcement officials to continually monitor polling places on election day. But he says he is more concerned about the bread-and-butter of election administration \u2013 processing early and absentee ballots, helping poll workers adapt to new processes and technology, and preparing for inevitable human errors. *** Luzerne county, Pennsylvania Luzerne county, an industrial battleground in north-eastern Pennsylvania, is facing a wave of conspiracy theories on the eve of the election. In late October, the county was doing some routine shredding of documents. When someone spotted the truck for the shredding company in front of the county\u2019s office building, which also houses its election offices, it set off conspiracy theories. Romilda Crocamo, the county manager, quickly started hearing online that the county was shredding ballots, which of course wasn\u2019t true. \u201cThere\u2019s a conspiracy theory for everything,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is nothing that we can say or do that will convince the people who believe in conspiracies to change their minds. I feel badly for those people. I don\u2019t know how you live that way.\u201d Crocamo is also worried about violence. During the early voting period, she had to call a sheriff to the elections office because two people were fighting. Someone called a bureau employee a racial slur. Another person spit on an employee. She said the county was adding barriers to control traffic into the office. Government employees will be required to go through a metal detector on election day. Scott Pressler, a conservative activist who has been registering voters in the state, suggested there was voter registration fraud in the county. As officials in another county investigate possible fraudulent registrations, Pressler suggested that there could be something amiss about voter registrations that were dropped off at the registration deadline by Beth Gilbert McBride, a voting rights organizer. McBride served as head of the Luzerne county election office in 2022 when it ran out of paper on election day. The claim was amplified by the Gateway Pundit, the influential far-right website that has become a powerful vector of election misinformation. Days later, the Luzerne county district attorney said that between 20 and 30 forms had been dropped off at the deadline, and none of them were fraudulent. *** Shasta county, California Voting in Shasta county, a conservative stronghold in far northern California, will largely proceed as normal. That\u2019s disappointing to the small but vocal group of residents who hoped to see radical changes in the community of 180,000 people that has attracted national attention for its far-right politics and embrace of election denialism. A band of local activists convinced of widespread voter fraud and stolen elections have been relentless in their efforts to uncover evidence of tampering. The group successfully lobbied officials, some of whom have also spread election misinformation, to throw out the county\u2019s voting machines and institute a hand-count system. When the head of the elections office retired, the county replaced her with someone who had no experience and who election skeptics thought would be sympathetic. They believed they would be able to remake the voting system, but their efforts ultimately proved unsuccessful. State lawmakers thwarted plans for a hand-count system with a bill preventing counties from using manual tallies in most elections. The new elections clerk has pushed back against proposals that would violate election law and said he won\u2019t make any major changes to county election processes. At a tense and widely attended meeting of the county\u2019s governing body last week, several expressed disappointment in the registrar of voters. \u201cYou cannot certify the election next Tuesday, no matter what happens because of what\u2019s happening in that office,\u201d one man said, asking officials to \u201cput pressure on\u201d the registrar. There\u2019s discontent among that group, said Jeff Gorder, a retired county public defender, but after years of upheaval and violent rhetoric in the area things feel surprisingly calm: \u201cIt seems to be a milder environment right now.\u201d Some elected officials have continued to sow doubt, though.

      "body": "<p>Thousands of people were at Mestalla this weekend, huge queues all along Avenida de Arag\u00f3n where Valencia\u2019s players arrived, but there was no game on, not here. They came instead with water, food and clothes for victims of the greatest natural catastrophe the country has seen: floods that have killed more than 210 people and destroyed towns and lives in the Horta Sud, just inland and south of the city, where a year\u2019s worth of rain fell in eight hours. Hundreds of cars and vans turned up and unloaded, and many more made their way by foot. More than a million tonnes of aid filled the space under the stand, silent above them.</p> \n<p>Three-and-a-half kilometres away at the Ciutat de Val\u00e8ncia, home of second-division Levante, the scene was much the same. Across the bridges that connect the city to the areas hit hardest, more came, carrying shovels and buckets. On the morning that Valencia had been due to play Real Madrid, 10,000 volunteers gathered at the Ciutat de les Arts i les Ci\u00e8ncies, taken by bus to the areas affected, when they could get there at all. In the mud with them were some of the footballers they should have been watching at Mestalla.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, the federation ratified La Liga\u2019s decision to postpone Valencia\u2019s game against Madrid and Rayo Vallecano\u2019s visit to Villarreal. In the second division, Levante-M\u00e1laga, Castell\u00f3n-Racing Ferrol and Eldense-Huesca were postponed. On Sunday, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/28/weather-tracker-cold-drop-to-cause-heavy-rain-in-spain\">the \u201cDana\u201d</a> moved towards Andaluc\u00eda, so was Almer\u00eda-Cordoba. Everyone else played, though, starting with Alav\u00e9s against Mallorca on Friday. After five consecutive defeats, Alav\u00e9s won, but the coach Luis Garc\u00eda, who forged his career in the region, from Altea to Villajoyosa, from Villarreal B to Elche and Benidorm, said: \u201cHowever you look at it, playing this makes no sense.\u201d</p> \n<p>He spoke for everyone, his the first voice of many. Getafe\u2019s manager Jos\u00e9 Bordal\u00e1s, a man born in Alicante and a man who spent 20 years coaching at smaller teams in the region, said: \u201cThese are difficult days for everyone; days pass and we\u2019re still in shock. We see the pictures, hear all sorts of stories and its frightening \u2026 Football fans are focused on the tragedy. I don\u2019t know what my colleagues have said, but this round of games shouldn\u2019t have been played.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many of Bordal\u00e1s\u2019s colleagues had said the same. \u201cIf I had been taking the decision I might have cancelled it,\u201d Barcelona\u2019s Hansi Flick admitted. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have played, even if there were no dates [to replay the fixtures on],\u201d insisted the Real Sociedad manager, Imanol Alguacil.</p> \n<p>As criticism grew, the league sought to justify its decision to continue. It didn\u2019t talk about the logistics of postponements, the difficulties of finding space in a cramped calendar, or the problems it would cause people \u2013 and when have they cared about that anyway? It didn\u2019t say that when the decision had been made it didn\u2019t yet know the full scale of the horror, and it was too late now. Instead, La Liga\u2019s president, Javier Tebas, claimed \u201cthe best message is to carry on\u201d. This way, there would be \u201cvisibility\u201d and \u201cmoney raised\u201d. As one colleague put it, sometimes football\u2019s ego is as great as its greed. Its representation and thus its responsibility might be even greater still.</p> \n<p>Football is the most important of the less important things, they say. The usual line claims it is put into perspective when life is lost, and that is true, if not always the way it is intended. Because football, like life, tends to go on regardless. It is not alone \u2013 this weekend many other events were held, concerts, sports arenas, shops and theatres filled \u2013 and it can be easy to point an accusing finger at football alone, held to different standards. But that is at least in part because it claims those standards for itself, embraces its status as the expression of a people, because it <em>is</em> a bit different: a reflection of society, of human emotion, community, identity and belonging. Which is good for the business that truly interests so many in power. \u201cIt makes no sense. But we\u2019re in a place where they tell us to carry on and so here we are, carrying on,\u201d Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s Diego Simeone said.</p> \n<p>It wouldn\u2019t be entirely true to say that none of it mattered, that no one came and nobody cared. In the first division, 241,503 people attended the seven games played . It wouldn\u2019t be true to say that they didn\u2019t enjoy them either, that there was no drama and no brilliant games \u2013 Girona-L\u00e9ganes and Athletic against Betis certainly were. Nor that there was no emotion, no celebration, no smiles or stories. No atmosphere or sense of occasion, at times. No silliness, even. At Montjuic, where Barcelona won 3-1 against Espanyol and at the Metropolitano where Atl\u00e9tico defeated Las Palmas 2-0, fans fell about laughing as they celebrated Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior winning the \u201cBeach Ball\u201d. The Espanyol coach, Manolo Gonz\u00e1lez, said he was \u201cburning inside\u201d at how his team had collapsed, and having to hear Bar\u00e7a fans taunting his team about heading to the second division. And Giuliano Simeone, scorer of his first Atl\u00e9tico goal almost 30 years to the day after his dad, described it as a dream come true.</p> \n<p>But none of it felt quite right, and certainly not the same, a guilt in every goal, every explosion of joy. Not least because the disaster was not something that <em>had happened</em>; it was something that was <em>happening</em>. As the weekend went on, and the football did too, the number of people who had lost their lives grew and so did the anger, the feeling of abandonment, that they had been failed. In Paiporta <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/03/residents-throw-mud-and-insults-at-spanish-king-on-visit-to-flood-hit-town\">they threw mud at the king</a>; it is all they have<strong>. </strong>The images kept coming: hard to watch, harder not to. The reports of the mess and the death, the <em>smell</em>. Pictures of the cars, crosses painted on the side to mark those they had checked for bodies; the awareness there were many, many more they had not yet.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of people were at Mestalla this weekend, huge queues all along Avenida de Arag\u00f3n where Valencia\u2019s players arrived, but there was no game on, not here. They came instead with water, food and clothes for victims of the greatest natural catastrophe the country has seen: floods that have killed more than 210 people and destroyed towns and lives in the Horta Sud, just inland and south of the city, where a year\u2019s worth of rain fell in eight hours. Hundreds of cars and vans turned up and unloaded, and many more made their way by foot. More than a million tonnes of aid filled the space under the stand, silent above them. Three-and-a-half kilometres away at the Ciutat de Val\u00e8ncia, home of second-division Levante, the scene was much the same. Across the bridges that connect the city to the areas hit hardest, more came, carrying shovels and buckets. On the morning that Valencia had been due to play Real Madrid, 10,000 volunteers gathered at the Ciutat de les Arts i les Ci\u00e8ncies, taken by bus to the areas affected, when they could get there at all. In the mud with them were some of the footballers they should have been watching at Mestalla. On Thursday, the federation ratified La Liga\u2019s decision to postpone Valencia\u2019s game against Madrid and Rayo Vallecano\u2019s visit to Villarreal. In the second division, Levante-M\u00e1laga, Castell\u00f3n-Racing Ferrol and Eldense-Huesca were postponed. On Sunday, as the \u201cDana\u201d moved towards Andaluc\u00eda, so was Almer\u00eda-Cordoba. Everyone else played, though, starting with Alav\u00e9s against Mallorca on Friday. After five consecutive defeats, Alav\u00e9s won, but the coach Luis Garc\u00eda, who forged his career in the region, from Altea to Villajoyosa, from Villarreal B to Elche and Benidorm, said: \u201cHowever you look at it, playing this makes no sense.\u201d He spoke for everyone, his the first voice of many. Getafe\u2019s manager Jos\u00e9 Bordal\u00e1s, a man born in Alicante and a man who spent 20 years coaching at smaller teams in the region, said: \u201cThese are difficult days for everyone; days pass and we\u2019re still in shock. We see the pictures, hear all sorts of stories and its frightening \u2026 Football fans are focused on the tragedy. I don\u2019t know what my colleagues have said, but this round of games shouldn\u2019t have been played.\u201d Many of Bordal\u00e1s\u2019s colleagues had said the same. \u201cIf I had been taking the decision I might have cancelled it,\u201d Barcelona\u2019s Hansi Flick admitted. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have played, even if there were no dates [to replay the fixtures on],\u201d insisted the Real Sociedad manager, Imanol Alguacil. As criticism grew, the league sought to justify its decision to continue. It didn\u2019t talk about the logistics of postponements, the difficulties of finding space in a cramped calendar, or the problems it would cause people \u2013 and when have they cared about that anyway? It didn\u2019t say that when the decision had been made it didn\u2019t yet know the full scale of the horror, and it was too late now. Instead, La Liga\u2019s president, Javier Tebas, claimed \u201cthe best message is to carry on\u201d. This way, there would be \u201cvisibility\u201d and \u201cmoney raised\u201d. As one colleague put it, sometimes football\u2019s ego is as great as its greed. Its representation and thus its responsibility might be even greater still. Football is the most important of the less important things, they say. The usual line claims it is put into perspective when life is lost, and that is true, if not always the way it is intended. Because football, like life, tends to go on regardless. It is not alone \u2013 this weekend many other events were held, concerts, sports arenas, shops and theatres filled \u2013 and it can be easy to point an accusing finger at football alone, held to different standards. But that is at least in part because it claims those standards for itself, embraces its status as the expression of a people, because it is a bit different: a reflection of society, of human emotion, community, identity and belonging. Which is good for the business that truly interests so many in power. \u201cIt makes no sense. But we\u2019re in a place where they tell us to carry on and so here we are, carrying on,\u201d Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s Diego Simeone said. It wouldn\u2019t be entirely true to say that none of it mattered, that no one came and nobody cared. In the first division, 241,503 people attended the seven games played . It wouldn\u2019t be true to say that they didn\u2019t enjoy them either, that there was no drama and no brilliant games \u2013 Girona-L\u00e9ganes and Athletic against Betis certainly were. Nor that there was no emotion, no celebration, no smiles or stories. No atmosphere or sense of occasion, at times. No silliness, even. At Montjuic, where Barcelona won 3-1 against Espanyol and at the Metropolitano where Atl\u00e9tico defeated Las Palmas 2-0, fans fell about laughing as they celebrated Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior winning the \u201cBeach Ball\u201d. The Espanyol coach, Manolo Gonz\u00e1lez, said he was \u201cburning inside\u201d at how his team had collapsed, and having to hear Bar\u00e7a fans taunting his team about heading to the second division. And Giuliano Simeone, scorer of his first Atl\u00e9tico goal almost 30 years to the day after his dad, described it as a dream come true. But none of it felt quite right, and certainly not the same, a guilt in every goal, every explosion of joy. Not least because the disaster was not something that had happened; it was something that was happening. As the weekend went on, and the football did too, the number of people who had lost their lives grew and so did the anger, the feeling of abandonment, that they had been failed. In Paiporta they threw mud at the king; it is all they have. The images kept coming: hard to watch, harder not to. The reports of the mess and the death, the smell. Pictures of the cars, crosses painted on the side to mark those they had checked for bodies; the awareness there were many, many more they had not yet. The fear that, with more than a thousand people still missing, the numbers would increase. Football is not immune ; although they\u2019re often held up as supermen, accused of living in a bubble where they can\u2019t be touched, players are not invincible. \u201cThe images on television are one thing; being there magnifies that five times,\u201d said the Levante coach, Juli\u00e1n Calero, whose town was among those hit. \u201cWhen these things happen you realise how fragile you are in the face of nature. It has taken so many people.\u201d Valencia defender Rub\u00e9n Iranzo\u2019s home was flooded.

Keir Starmer and his team have sought to prepare themselves for either eventuality: a Kamala Harris victory, with its easier, more predictable consequences, or a second Donald Trump administration and the volatility that would bring. Here\u2019s a look at what a Harris or Trump win would mean for UK-US relations. Politics A Trump victory would be politically awkward for the Labour government, which has close links to the Democrats. The Trump campaign filed a legal complaint last month accusing the Labour party of interfering in the US election after it emerged that 100 current and former staffers were heading to the US to campaign for Harris. Starmer has sought to separate party and government, and has made overtures to Trump since becoming prime minister in July.

Climate and environment The US has repeatedly, under Trump and Biden, insisted agriculture must be core to any post-Brexit trade agreement, but the British public has been promised that chlorinated meat and hormone-fed beef will be excluded \u2013 an impasse that will stymy Starmer, but opens up opportunities for Kemi Badenoch should she decide to take up the cudgels for free trade over food safety. Starmer used his first speech to fellow world leaders at the UN general assembly in September to present his government as a global leader on the climate, and will repeat that next week at the Cop29 summit. Harris would be a powerful ally; a Trump win would send the prospects of limiting global heating to safe limits into a tailspin. Trade Nearly five years after Brexit, the prospect of that US-UK trade deal looks more distant than ever. In the summer of 2023, Rishi Sunak conceded that agreeing one was not a priority for either country and had not been for a while. The fact that the Democrats and Republicans remain notably protectionist in their economic policy does not bode well for hopes of a free trade agreement under Labour. Both US parties are keen to appeal to voters in battleground states in the rust belt who have suffered from deindustrialisation. Trump\u2019s economic agenda in particular is built around tariffs \u2013 he has suggested that under his presidency, all goods imported into the US could be slapped with a 10% tariff and that vehicles could be hit with a 100% tariff, affecting UK exporters. While Harris isn\u2019t nearly as protectionist in her approach, a bilateral trade agreement with the UK is unlikely to be a priority for her.",

      "bodyText": "They were portrayed as self-satisfied and insufferable by Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary, but research suggests cohabiting couples may have something to be smug about: they have a lower risk of depression than singletons. A large-scale analysis involving more than 100,000 individuals across seven countries has added weight to previous research suggesting that being married or in a \u201cmarriage-like\u201d relationship could bring health benefits. While the researchers do not advocate dashing down the aisle to dodge depression, saying personal circumstances and broader social factors also play a significant role in mental health, they claim their research could help inform strategies for tackling the condition in society. \u201cThe study underscores the importance of developing culturally-sensitive interventions and support systems to address the elevated depression vulnerability among unmarried individuals, particularly those with higher risk profiles based on country, sex and education level,\u201d said Dr Kefeng Li, co-author of the research from Macao Polytechnic University, China. Writing in the journal Nature Human Behaviour, the team report how they first analysed data from 106,556 participants in seven countries \u2013 including China, the UK, the US, Indonesia and South Korea \u2013 22,490 of whom reported having depressive symptoms. After taking into account factors such as age, sex, education, smoking status, body mass index and health conditions, the team found that people who did not live with a partner had an 86% higher chance of having depression than those who did. \u201cUnmarried but cohabiting participants were considered as \u2018married\u2019 in this study,\u201d said Li. The study did not look at the impact on non-cohabiting relationships. The odds were elevated regardless of whether unmarried people were single (79% greater odds of depression than married people), divorced or separated (99% greater odds), or had been widowed (64% greater odds). The team said the association was particularly strong in western countries among men, and in people with higher levels of education. That, they suggest, could be due to cultural differences in how emotional distress is tolerated, with women having larger and stronger social support networks, and more highly educated individuals potentially experiencing greater pressures and demands. The team also enrolled 20,865 participants from five countries and followed up with them for four to 18 years. Overall, 4,486 participants reported developing symptoms of depression, with the analysis revealing that alcohol consumption could be a reason for unmarried people having a higher risk of depression \u2013 at least in China, Mexico and South Korea \u2013 with smoking another possible factor in China and Mexico. The team say these results could be linked to married adults tending to have lower rates of alcohol and tobacco consumption. The researchers also said marriage may bring benefits through better access to economic resources, social support and spouses having a positive influence on each other\u2019s mental wellbeing. However, the study has limitations, including its reliance on self-reported depressive symptoms, its inclusion of only heterosexual couples, and the way it is based on associations. \u201cIt does not prove that being unmarried directly causes depression or that getting married would prevent or cure depression,\u201d said Li, adding that the quality of a marital relationship is probably also important but was not considered in the study. Dr Veronica Lamarche of the University of Essex, who was not involved in the study, said previous research had revealed health benefits of being in a relationship compared with being single. However, she also said the quality of a relationship is important. Indeed, a recent study suggested that conflict within a marriage can be damaging for mental health. \u201cCrucially, this [study] should not be seen as a motivation to go out and get married for the sake of it,\u201d Lamarche said. \u201cThere is a growing body of research showing that people who are single by choice and feel comfortable in that stage in life show similar health outcomes to people who are in a relationship. \u201cPeople also get many of the same health and wellbeing benefits from their connections with close friends and family as they do from marital partners.

      "body": "<p>Over the course of 91 years, Quincy Jones did pretty much everything you could do in the entertainment industry. He was a musician, arranger, composer, solo artist, record company executive, mogul, entrepreneur and a producer not just of music but of films and TV \u2013 and, as was noted in Chris Heath\u2019s extraordinary, headline-grabbing 2018 profile piece Quincy Jones Has a Story About That, he had known everyone. \u201cThe ghetto Gump\u201d, as he called himself, referring to Forrest, was the thread that linked Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis to Dr Dre and the Weeknd; a musician who\u2019d appeared with Elvis Presley and Amy Winehouse, Count Basie and Bono, Nat King Cole and Young Thug; the man who had a credit on Sinatra At the Sands and Harry\u2019s House by Harry Styles.</p> <p>It\u2019s a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 unlike any other. How did he achieve it? He was clearly driven, perhaps as the result of a difficult childhood. Born on the gang-ridden South Side of Chicago during the Great Depression, Jones wandered into \u201cthe wrong neighbourhood\u201d aged seven, was stabbed through the hand with a switchblade and attacked with an icepick. His mother suffered a nervous breakdown and was committed to a psychiatric hospital. Jones spent time living with his grandmother in Kentucky in such poverty that he claimed they survived by eating rats. Then his father moved the family to Washington and remarried, to a woman Jones said was physically abusive.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He was stabbed in the hand aged seven \u2013 and later claimed to have lived in such poverty that he had to eat rats</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Jones was also prodigiously talented, still at college when he was invited to quit in order to work with vibraphonist and former Benny Goodman sideman Lionel Hampton. Hampton had started his own orchestra, a big band nimble enough to traverse the end of the swing era and take the rise of bebop and of rhythm and blues in its stride: an object lesson in staying open-minded and moving with the times that one suspects stayed with Jones.</p> <p>Certainly, when he moved to New York and began working as a freelance arranger, Jones\u2019s approach was admirably catholic: his list of clients ranged from big-band luminaries including Count Basie and Gene Krupa, to stars from jazz\u2019s new wave \u2013 Clifford Brown and Cannonball Adderley among them \u2013 to rhythm and blues artist Big Maybelle, whose original version of Whole Lotta Shakin\u2019 Goin\u2019 On Jones arranged and produced. </p>    <p>His ability to slip between genres may well have involved a degree of pragmatism. He had become a recording artist in his own right in the late 50s, leading bands staffed with impressive musicians \u2013 one session for his second album featured Charles Mingus, Milt Jackson, Art Farmer and Herbie Mann \u2013 but when he formed his own 18-piece big band in Europe in 1959, they achieved both critical acclaim and penury. Resolving to \u201clearn the difference between music and the music business\u201d, he took a job at Mercury Records, where his breakthrough hit was Lesley Gore\u2019s 1963 teen-pop anthem It\u2019s My Party, rush-released to beat a version of the same song Phil Spector had recorded with the Crystals.</p> <p>On the one hand, you could view that record\u2019s adolescent soap opera as being at odds with the sophisticated and complex music Jones had released on his own recent albums. These included The Quintessence \u2013 home to an astonishing, breakneck take on Thelonious Monk\u2019s Straight, No Chaser \u2013 and Big Band Bossa Nova, which opened with Jones\u2019s evergreen composition Soul Bossa Nova, best known today as the theme to the Austin Powers films.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With In Cold Blood, he faced down the racism of Truman Capote, who wanted someone who wasn\u2019t black</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On the other, perhaps you could tell they were the work of the same man: after all, beneath the campy melodrama of the lyrics, there was a distinct Latin-American flavour to the rhythm of It\u2019s My Party, an elegance to its punchy horn arrangement. Besides, nobody else in music was shifting with apparent ease between recording chart-topping teen pop singles, arranging and conducting the Count Basie Orchestra for a collaborative album with Frank Sinatra (1964\u2019s It Might As Well Be Swing), releasing progressive jazz albums and pursing a parallel career as a film composer.</p> <p>The latter aspect of Jones\u2019s career kicked off with the soundtrack for Sidney Lumet\u2019s 1964 film The Pawnbroker, and reached a pinnacle with his work on 1967\u2019s neo-noir crime movie In Cold Blood. He faced down both the objections of Columbia Pictures, which wanted Elmer Bernstein, and the racism of In Cold Blood\u2019s author Truman Capote, who wanted someone who wasn\u2019t black, to deliver a set of mournful, harrowing and frequently atonal music that earned an Oscar nomination \u2013 he was the first African-American composer to be shortlisted.</p>    <p>Meanwhile, as the 60s turned into the 70s, his own albums began slipping their moorings in straight jazz, offering instead a purist-enraging cocktail of soul and funk with jazz harmonics and improvisation and atmospheric, faintly psychedelic orchestrations, where blues guitar instrumentals sat alongside TV themes and stunning, lengthy reworkings of recent hits: 1971\u2019s Smackwater Jack had his 10-minute take on Marvin Gaye\u2019s What\u2019s Going On?, 1973\u2019s You\u2019ve Got It Bad Girl his sublime reimagining of the Lovin\u2019 Spoonful\u2019s Summer In the City.</p> <p>Their cast lists gradually became more packed, as jazz musicians rubbed shoulders with star vocalists and crack session players: 1974\u2019s Body Heat featured Herbie Hancock and Bob James alongside members of the Funk Brothers, Stevie Wonder-affiliated synth pioneers Tonto\u2019s Expanding Headband, Billy Preston, Minnie Riperton and Al Jarreau. This approach peaked on 1978\u2019s Sounds \u2026 And Stuff Like That! \u2013 home to the supremely funky Stuff Like That, which paired Chaka Khan with Ashford and Simpson on vocals \u2013 and 1981\u2019s platinum-selling, triple Grammy-winning The Dude, which spawned a string of hit singles, of which the fabulously sophisticated post-disco funk of Razzamatazz might be the pick.</p> <p>By the time of The Dude\u2019s release, Jones had begun his association with Michael Jackson. They met while working together on the The Wiz, an African American retelling of The Wizard of Oz. The three albums they made together would change pop history, and while Jackson\u2019s astonishing talent was unequivocally the star of the show, Jones\u2019s fingerprints were all over the finished products.</p> <p>It was Jones who brought former Heatwave keyboardist Rod Temperton in as a songwriter \u2013 he contributed six tracks to Off The Wall and Thriller, including Rock With You, and the title tracks of both albums \u2013 and Jones who knew how to get hold of Vincent Price for a suitably ghoulish monologue. On Off The Wall, you could hear his jazz background seeping into the sound of I Can\u2019t Help It and She\u2019s Out Of My Life (a song Jones originally intended for Frank Sinatra), and spot his disinclination to be hemmed in by genre in the decision to drop Girlfriend \u2013 a cover of a Paul McCartney-penned soft rock track from Wings\u2019 poorly received album London Town \u2013 into the middle of what was ostensibly a disco album.</p>    <p>Thriller, meanwhile, carried a distinct hint of Jones\u2019s pragmatism. If Jackson wanted to be the world\u2019s biggest star, as he had claimed, then his album would have to have the broadest possible appeal, hence the duet with Paul McCartney and the appearance of Eddie Van Halen on Beat It.</p> <p>After his association with Michael Jackson came to an end with the release of 1987\u2019s Bad (there were disputes later over royalties that ended in court, and Jones baldly accused Jackson of stealing the bassline of Billie Jean from another of his productions, Donna Summer\u2019s State of Independence), Jones carried on doing extraordinary things: not perhaps on the scale of producing the biggest-selling album in the history of the music industry, but stuff that one suspected only he could do.</p> <p>Jones somehow convinced the ailing Miles Davis to do the one thing he\u2019d always refused to do and revisit the music from his classic collaborations with Gil Evans, at the Montreux jazz festival a matter of weeks before his death in 1991. He was presumably the only person who could record an album with a supporting cast that featured Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Barry White and Ice-T. There were hugely successful diversions into TV and film production. When Chris Heath met him, Jones was 84 and said he\u2019d never been busier in his life: 10 movies, six albums, four Broadway shows, a TV biopic, a documentary all in the works.</p> <p>He achieved so much that any kind of posthumous appraisal feels as if it\u2019s only scratching the surface. Perhaps it\u2019s just best to say that Quincy Jones could \u2013 and did \u2013 do it all. It\u2019s hard to think of a more striking epitaph for any artist.</p> <p>\u2022 This article and headline were amended on 5 November 2024. Thelonious Monk wrote Straight, No Chaser, not Charles Mingus; Columbia hoped to hire Elmer Bernstein, not Leonard. An earlier headline mentioned Elvis; to clarify, Quincy Jones appeared with him but did not work with him.</p>",

Meanwhile, as the 60s turned into the 70s, his own albums began slipping their moorings in straight jazz, offering instead a purist-enraging cocktail of soul and funk with jazz harmonics and improvisation and atmospheric, faintly psychedelic orchestrations, where blues guitar instrumentals sat alongside TV themes and stunning, lengthy reworkings of recent hits: 1971\u2019s Smackwater Jack had his 10-minute take on Marvin Gaye\u2019s What\u2019s Going On?, 1973\u2019s You\u2019ve Got It Bad Girl his sublime reimagining of the Lovin\u2019 Spoonful\u2019s Summer In the City. Their cast lists gradually became more packed, as jazz musicians rubbed shoulders with star vocalists and crack session players: 1974\u2019s Body Heat featured Herbie Hancock and Bob James alongside members of the Funk Brothers, Stevie Wonder-affiliated synth pioneers Tonto\u2019s Expanding Headband, Billy Preston, Minnie Riperton and Al Jarreau. This approach peaked on 1978\u2019s Sounds \u2026 And Stuff Like That! \u2013 home to the supremely funky Stuff Like That, which paired Chaka Khan with Ashford and Simpson on vocals \u2013 and 1981\u2019s platinum-selling, triple Grammy-winning The Dude, which spawned a string of hit singles, of which the fabulously sophisticated post-disco funk of Razzamatazz might be the pick. By the time of The Dude\u2019s release, Jones had begun his association with Michael Jackson. They met while working together on the The Wiz, an African American retelling of The Wizard of Oz. The three albums they made together would change pop history, and while Jackson\u2019s astonishing talent was unequivocally the star of the show, Jones\u2019s fingerprints were all over the finished products. It was Jones who brought former Heatwave keyboardist Rod Temperton in as a songwriter \u2013 he contributed six tracks to Off The Wall and Thriller, including Rock With You, and the title tracks of both albums \u2013 and Jones who knew how to get hold of Vincent Price for a suitably ghoulish monologue. On Off The Wall, you could hear his jazz background seeping into the sound of I Can\u2019t Help It and She\u2019s Out Of My Life (a song Jones originally intended for Frank Sinatra), and spot his disinclination to be hemmed in by genre in the decision to drop Girlfriend \u2013 a cover of a Paul McCartney-penned soft rock track from Wings\u2019 poorly received album London Town \u2013 into the middle of what was ostensibly a disco album. Thriller, meanwhile, carried a distinct hint of Jones\u2019s pragmatism. If Jackson wanted to be the world\u2019s biggest star, as he had claimed, then his album would have to have the broadest possible appeal, hence the duet with Paul McCartney and the appearance of Eddie Van Halen on Beat It. After his association with Michael Jackson came to an end with the release of 1987\u2019s Bad (there were disputes later over royalties that ended in court, and Jones baldly accused Jackson of stealing the bassline of Billie Jean from another of his productions, Donna Summer\u2019s State of Independence), Jones carried on doing extraordinary things: not perhaps on the scale of producing the biggest-selling album in the history of the music industry, but stuff that one suspected only he could do. Jones somehow convinced the ailing Miles Davis to do the one thing he\u2019d always refused to do and revisit the music from his classic collaborations with Gil Evans, at the Montreux jazz festival a matter of weeks before his death in 1991. He was presumably the only person who could record an album with a supporting cast that featured Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Barry White and Ice-T. There were hugely successful diversions into TV and film production. When Chris Heath met him, Jones was 84 and said he\u2019d never been busier in his life: 10 movies, six albums, four Broadway shows, a TV biopic, a documentary all in the works. He achieved so much that any kind of posthumous appraisal feels as if it\u2019s only scratching the surface. Perhaps it\u2019s just best to say that Quincy Jones could \u2013 and did \u2013 do it all. It\u2019s hard to think of a more striking epitaph for any artist. \u2022 This article and headline were amended on 5 November 2024. Thelonious Monk wrote Straight, No Chaser, not Charles Mingus; Columbia hoped to hire Elmer Bernstein, not Leonard. An earlier headline mentioned Elvis; to clarify, Quincy Jones appeared with him but did not work with him.",

He\u2019s hawked official Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/22/trump-commemorative-coins\">coins</a>, a Trump-branded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/06/trump-bible-review\">Bible</a>, the \u201cnever surrender\u201d high-top <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/18/trump-launches-gold-high-top-sneaker-line-a-day-after-350m-court-ruling\">sneakers</a> and \u201cthe ugliest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/30/donald-trump-watches-merchandise\">watch</a> I have ever seen in my life\u201d, said Oliver. \u201cIt makes your wrist look like it\u2019s having a midlife crisis. It looks like it was made by melting down King Charles.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/28/john-oliver-trump-immigration\">John Oliver on Trump\u2019s immigration plan: \u2018Full of shit from a practical standpoint, as well as a moral one\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe fact Trump is willing to slap his name on random products is nothing new. It\u2019s always been part of his MO,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut the scope of his business ventures has actually escalated sharply,\u201d which makes sense \u2013 since leaving office, Trump has racked up millions in legal expenses and has multiple judgments worth hundreds of millions against him. \u201cDoes nearly half a billion in penalties hanging over his head make the greediest man to ever live even greedier?\u201d Oliver wondered. \u201cMaybe, maybe not. After all, Trump is always operating at maximum greed, the same way the ocean is always operating at maximum wet.</p> <p>\u201cBut it does mean that he is a little more desperate,\u201d Oliver continued, because if Trump\u2019s appeals fail and he doesn\u2019t come up with the money, courts could order his assets \u2013 including his beloved Mar-a-Lago resort \u2013 seized and sold. The incentive is to make more money than even, and if he wins the election, \u201che\u2019s got some troubling new ways to do that\u201d, said Oliver.</p> <p>Oliver recapped the guardrails during Trump\u2019s first term which, unfortunately, weren\u2019t so much legal guardrails as \u201cnorms that could be ignored\u201d. Trump wasn\u2019t required to release his tax returns or put his assets in a blind trust, so he didn\u2019t. \u201cIf Trump is not required to do something, he\u2019s not doing it,\u201d Oliver noted. \u201cIt\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t say he lost the last election, or hug his children, or bother to learn the fucking dance moves to YMCA \u2013 for the love of God, move your arms above your shoulders, you human pot roast.\u201d</p> <p>Trump instead put his assets into a revocable trust that he could access any time, run by his sons Eric and Don Jr as well as the company CFO, Allen Weisselberg, who has gone to jail twice for lying under oath and dodging taxes.</p> <p>Trump also blew past whatever laws did exist over presidential finances. The emoluments clause of the US constitution forbids the president from accepting money or gifts of any kind from foreign governments unless he obtains consent of Congress to do so, but his businesses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/04/trump-businesses-payment-house-investigation-china-saudi-arabia\">made $7.8m</a> from 20 foreign governments during his time in office. The top spenders were China, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.</p> <p>\u201cIn any other universe, \u2018president accepts money from foreign governments\u2019 would be immediately disqualifying,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cUnfortunately, we live in this universe, where a candidate for president has been criminally indicted four times and convicted of 34 felony counts thus far, his running mate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/jul/29/john-oliver-jd-vance\">sees women as walking incubators</a> and Reba McEntire still hasn\u2019t done Hot Ones. This is not the ideal timeline!\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s financial violations during his presidency were the subject of several lawsuits, but he left office before they were settled, leading the supreme court to dismiss the matter as moot in January 2021. \u201cBasically, he ran out the clock,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cSo there is no evidence to suggest that Trump won\u2019t carry on his personal enrichment during a second term.\u201d</p> <p>And he has more avenues to do so, if elected again. Since leaving office, Trump launched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/trump-media-mexico-jobs\">Trump Media</a> &amp; Technology Group, whose flagship product is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/29/truth-social-trading-suspended\">Truth Social</a>, or as Oliver called it, \u201cthe Maga version of Twitter, a phrase that is now totally redundant\u201d. The company is now Trump\u2019s highest-valued financial holding by far, though that does not reflect the lackluster performance of Truth Social, which is the 1,174th most popular website in the US. But because presidents are not bound by federal conflict of interest law, Trump could use the office of the president to artificially boost the stock to his personal enrichment. American companies seeking to curry favor could buy ads on the platform and foreign governments looking to do the same could buy shares of the company.</p> <p>Public companies are still subject to some regulation; his ventures into crypto, on the other hand, are not. In the past two years, Trump has launched his own branded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/17/donald-trumps-digital-trading-card-collection-sells-out-in-less-than-a-day\">NFTs</a> (non-fungible tokens), which have made him at least $7.2m off what Oliver declared \u201cworthless pieces of shit\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/07/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-vp-debate\">John Oliver on VP debate\u2019s \u2018civility\u2019: \u2018Etiquette is kind of beside the point\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Trump family has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/17/trump-crypto-world-liberty-financial\">launched</a> a vague crypto-focused company called World Liberty Financial with Trump as its \u201cchief crypto advocate\u201d. The company \u201cintends to build a platform that will allow users to trade, borrow and lend cryptocurrencies\u201d, according to its \u201cGold Paper\u201d.</p> <p>If Trump wins, it\u2019s expected that he will directly influence regulations \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 of crypto companies, which one expert described as \u201cconflict of interest 101\u201d. \u201cThis is obviously extremely dangerous, but especially in a place that\u2019s so new,\u201d said Oliver. With crypto, Oliver summarized, Trump would not only be exploiting loopholes, but creating the loopholes in real time.</p> <p>\u201cIt was clear before Trump was elected that he\u2019d use the presidency to enrich himself,\u201d Oliver noted. \u201cBut in a second term, the landscape is very different. We\u2019re no longer talking about a tacky Florida country club that CEOs or foreign officials can visit for special access to the president. It\u2019s two new companies in branches of technology that we\u2019re still trying to figure out how to regulate, that could expose him to new levels of risk and provide avenues for people to funnel money to him and influence him.</p> <p>\u201cNone of this is the biggest reason not to vote for him,\u201d he concluded. \u201cBut it\u2019s another good one to put alongside the many, many others.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "On the final episode of Last Week Tonight before the 2024 election, John Oliver provided one final reason not to vote for Donald Trump: his many dubious businesses, which could guide his actions if elected president again. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked all year about the many good reasons not to vote for him: his mass deportation plans, his shaping of the courts, Project 2025, everything he said or did before his presidency, everything he said or did during his presidency, everything he said or did after his presidency and the fact that it should be unconstitutional to have a vice-president named JD,\u201d said Oliver. But when it comes to making money as a former president, \u201cTrump is in a category all his own\u201d, he added. Since leaving office, Trump\u2019s hotels have announced deals in Saudi Arabia, Dubai and Vietnam. He\u2019s hawked official Trump coins, a Trump-branded Bible, the \u201cnever surrender\u201d high-top sneakers and \u201cthe ugliest watch I have ever seen in my life\u201d, said Oliver. \u201cIt makes your wrist look like it\u2019s having a midlife crisis. It looks like it was made by melting down King Charles. \u201cThe fact Trump is willing to slap his name on random products is nothing new. It\u2019s always been part of his MO,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut the scope of his business ventures has actually escalated sharply,\u201d which makes sense \u2013 since leaving office, Trump has racked up millions in legal expenses and has multiple judgments worth hundreds of millions against him. \u201cDoes nearly half a billion in penalties hanging over his head make the greediest man to ever live even greedier?\u201d Oliver wondered. \u201cMaybe, maybe not. After all, Trump is always operating at maximum greed, the same way the ocean is always operating at maximum wet. \u201cBut it does mean that he is a little more desperate,\u201d Oliver continued, because if Trump\u2019s appeals fail and he doesn\u2019t come up with the money, courts could order his assets \u2013 including his beloved Mar-a-Lago resort \u2013 seized and sold. The incentive is to make more money than even, and if he wins the election, \u201che\u2019s got some troubling new ways to do that\u201d, said Oliver. Oliver recapped the guardrails during Trump\u2019s first term which, unfortunately, weren\u2019t so much legal guardrails as \u201cnorms that could be ignored\u201d. Trump wasn\u2019t required to release his tax returns or put his assets in a blind trust, so he didn\u2019t. \u201cIf Trump is not required to do something, he\u2019s not doing it,\u201d Oliver noted. \u201cIt\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t say he lost the last election, or hug his children, or bother to learn the fucking dance moves to YMCA \u2013 for the love of God, move your arms above your shoulders, you human pot roast.\u201d Trump instead put his assets into a revocable trust that he could access any time, run by his sons Eric and Don Jr as well as the company CFO, Allen Weisselberg, who has gone to jail twice for lying under oath and dodging taxes. Trump also blew past whatever laws did exist over presidential finances. The emoluments clause of the US constitution forbids the president from accepting money or gifts of any kind from foreign governments unless he obtains consent of Congress to do so, but his businesses made $7.8m from 20 foreign governments during his time in office. The top spenders were China, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. \u201cIn any other universe, \u2018president accepts money from foreign governments\u2019 would be immediately disqualifying,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cUnfortunately, we live in this universe, where a candidate for president has been criminally indicted four times and convicted of 34 felony counts thus far, his running mate sees women as walking incubators and Reba McEntire still hasn\u2019t done Hot Ones. This is not the ideal timeline!\u201d Trump\u2019s financial violations during his presidency were the subject of several lawsuits, but he left office before they were settled, leading the supreme court to dismiss the matter as moot in January 2021. \u201cBasically, he ran out the clock,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cSo there is no evidence to suggest that Trump won\u2019t carry on his personal enrichment during a second term.\u201d And he has more avenues to do so, if elected again. Since leaving office, Trump launched Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, whose flagship product is Truth Social, or as Oliver called it, \u201cthe Maga version of Twitter, a phrase that is now totally redundant\u201d. The company is now Trump\u2019s highest-valued financial holding by far, though that does not reflect the lackluster performance of Truth Social, which is the 1,174th most popular website in the US. But because presidents are not bound by federal conflict of interest law, Trump could use the office of the president to artificially boost the stock to his personal enrichment. American companies seeking to curry favor could buy ads on the platform and foreign governments looking to do the same could buy shares of the company. Public companies are still subject to some regulation; his ventures into crypto, on the other hand, are not. In the past two years, Trump has launched his own branded NFTs (non-fungible tokens), which have made him at least $7.2m off what Oliver declared \u201cworthless pieces of shit\u201d. The Trump family has also launched a vague crypto-focused company called World Liberty Financial with Trump as its \u201cchief crypto advocate\u201d. The company \u201cintends to build a platform that will allow users to trade, borrow and lend cryptocurrencies\u201d, according to its \u201cGold Paper\u201d. If Trump wins, it\u2019s expected that he will directly influence regulations \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 of crypto companies, which one expert described as \u201cconflict of interest 101\u201d. \u201cThis is obviously extremely dangerous, but especially in a place that\u2019s so new,\u201d said Oliver. With crypto, Oliver summarized, Trump would not only be exploiting loopholes, but creating the loopholes in real time. \u201cIt was clear before Trump was elected that he\u2019d use the presidency to enrich himself,\u201d Oliver noted. \u201cBut in a second term, the landscape is very different. We\u2019re no longer talking about a tacky Florida country club that CEOs or foreign officials can visit for special access to the president. It\u2019s two new companies in branches of technology that we\u2019re still trying to figure out how to regulate, that could expose him to new levels of risk and provide avenues for people to funnel money to him and influence him. \u201cNone of this is the biggest reason not to vote for him,\u201d he concluded. \u201cBut it\u2019s another good one to put alongside the many, many others.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In a room with breathtaking views of Ullswater, the tranquillity is punctuated by the chattering sound of sewing machines and snippets of laughter and lively conversation.</p> <p>It may be a beautiful Lake District hotel retreat but there is no time for a spa or a hike up Helvellyn \u2013 we are here to sew.</p> <p>I admit to the group I have some trepidation. It is at least a decade since I used a sewing machine and even then it was to make misshapen cushion covers that, come to think of it, I don\u2019t remember finishing. It seems a big step up to be producing a jumpsuit in two days, but Izzy Butcher, my teacher, is confident I can do it.</p> <p>She has taught many beginners at IzzoSew Studio in Sheffield, where she has been running increasingly popular city-centre sewing retreats for two years. This is the first one she is holding in a rural setting, surrounded by nature.</p>    <p>\u201cHaving a beautiful view is so good for the mind and soul,\u201d says Butcher, who was a chartered landscape architect before she dived full-time into running sewing meet-ups, retreats and workshops, teaching how to run up everything from anoraks to jeans.</p> <p>All seven women on this weekend\u2019s retreat have brought a project to work on. Some are experienced with creating their own garments, while others, like me, make up the increasing number of beginners.</p> <p>The pandemic created a boom in people taking up sewing, the women explain, particularly among those making their own clothes. The BBC One competition The Great British Sewing Bee, now 10 series in, has spread the word, and a wider choice of fabrics and better patterns has made sewing more appealing and accessible. Social media is perhaps the biggest factor in the rise, though, harbouring a flourishing online world of sewing amateurs and experts.</p>    <p>For the group, the retreat is a chance to get away from the day-to-day, particularly family responsibilities, and focus on something mindful and fulfilling. \u201cWe get a lot of people with intense jobs coming on retreats,\u201d says Butcher, \u201cbecause it just lets them escape.\u201d</p> <p>Cath Walsh, who is making a pair of jeans, adds: \u201cBeing creative is good for your mental health.\u201d</p> <p>Having done a lot of sewing when she was younger and taking a break for a busy career and children, Walsh returned to the craft about six years ago after chemotherapy for breast cancer.</p> <p>\u201cThe treatment was quite brutal,\u201d she says. \u201cI was trying to get my life back together. I was too ill to work but I got my sewing machine out and started sewing again.\u201d</p> <p>Younger people are often motivated to start sewing over worries about the poor pay and conditions of the workers producing fast fashion. I\u2019m deeply concerned about this, yet I find myself buying cheap clothing out of ignorance and convenience, which I am keen to stop.</p> <p>Butcher says she hears this a lot. \u201cOne of the drivers is definitely sustainability, especially knowing who made your clothes.\u201d</p> <p>The pattern I\u2019m working on is one of Butcher\u2019s own designs. She helps me get started by taking measurements and adjusting the pattern to my body shape, as it caters for sizes 6 to 32. It strikes me that this is the first piece of clothing that is made to fit <em>me</em>.</p> <p>\u201cWhen it\u2019s a fabric you love, you made it and it fits beautifully, it\u2019s special,\u201d says Butcher.</p>    <p>Visions of being a tangled \u2013 and possibly bloodied \u2013 mess of fabric and thread are quashed early as I manage to cut the right shapes and begin stitching them together.</p> <p>Saturday passes at incredible speed and by the day\u2019s end, I have something resembling a jumpsuit. It is far beyond what I thought I was capable of.</p> <p>When I put on the completed outfit on Sunday, I feel a genuine sense of accomplishment. Better still, I have made something I will actually wear. My new supportive group of friends are delighted too.</p> <p>Butcher says: \u201cIt\u2019s a real privilege to have a business where you get to inspire other people \u2013 and I often find it inspirational too.\u201d</p> <p>My Yorkshire garment-worker ancestors would probably have something to say about my wonky seams and uneven overlocking but, to me, the jumpsuit is perfect.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.izzosewstudio.com/\">IzzoSew Studio</a> runs retreats in Sheffield, the Lake District and the Peak District.

      "bodyText": "In a room with breathtaking views of Ullswater, the tranquillity is punctuated by the chattering sound of sewing machines and snippets of laughter and lively conversation. It may be a beautiful Lake District hotel retreat but there is no time for a spa or a hike up Helvellyn \u2013 we are here to sew. I admit to the group I have some trepidation. It is at least a decade since I used a sewing machine and even then it was to make misshapen cushion covers that, come to think of it, I don\u2019t remember finishing. It seems a big step up to be producing a jumpsuit in two days, but Izzy Butcher, my teacher, is confident I can do it. She has taught many beginners at IzzoSew Studio in Sheffield, where she has been running increasingly popular city-centre sewing retreats for two years. This is the first one she is holding in a rural setting, surrounded by nature. \u201cHaving a beautiful view is so good for the mind and soul,\u201d says Butcher, who was a chartered landscape architect before she dived full-time into running sewing meet-ups, retreats and workshops, teaching how to run up everything from anoraks to jeans. All seven women on this weekend\u2019s retreat have brought a project to work on. Some are experienced with creating their own garments, while others, like me, make up the increasing number of beginners. The pandemic created a boom in people taking up sewing, the women explain, particularly among those making their own clothes. The BBC One competition The Great British Sewing Bee, now 10 series in, has spread the word, and a wider choice of fabrics and better patterns has made sewing more appealing and accessible. Social media is perhaps the biggest factor in the rise, though, harbouring a flourishing online world of sewing amateurs and experts. For the group, the retreat is a chance to get away from the day-to-day, particularly family responsibilities, and focus on something mindful and fulfilling. \u201cWe get a lot of people with intense jobs coming on retreats,\u201d says Butcher, \u201cbecause it just lets them escape.\u201d Cath Walsh, who is making a pair of jeans, adds: \u201cBeing creative is good for your mental health.\u201d Having done a lot of sewing when she was younger and taking a break for a busy career and children, Walsh returned to the craft about six years ago after chemotherapy for breast cancer. \u201cThe treatment was quite brutal,\u201d she says. \u201cI was trying to get my life back together. I was too ill to work but I got my sewing machine out and started sewing again.\u201d Younger people are often motivated to start sewing over worries about the poor pay and conditions of the workers producing fast fashion. I\u2019m deeply concerned about this, yet I find myself buying cheap clothing out of ignorance and convenience, which I am keen to stop. Butcher says she hears this a lot. \u201cOne of the drivers is definitely sustainability, especially knowing who made your clothes.\u201d The pattern I\u2019m working on is one of Butcher\u2019s own designs. She helps me get started by taking measurements and adjusting the pattern to my body shape, as it caters for sizes 6 to 32. It strikes me that this is the first piece of clothing that is made to fit me. \u201cWhen it\u2019s a fabric you love, you made it and it fits beautifully, it\u2019s special,\u201d says Butcher. Visions of being a tangled \u2013 and possibly bloodied \u2013 mess of fabric and thread are quashed early as I manage to cut the right shapes and begin stitching them together. Saturday passes at incredible speed and by the day\u2019s end, I have something resembling a jumpsuit. It is far beyond what I thought I was capable of. When I put on the completed outfit on Sunday, I feel a genuine sense of accomplishment. Better still, I have made something I will actually wear. My new supportive group of friends are delighted too. Butcher says: \u201cIt\u2019s a real privilege to have a business where you get to inspire other people \u2013 and I often find it inspirational too.\u201d My Yorkshire garment-worker ancestors would probably have something to say about my wonky seams and uneven overlocking but, to me, the jumpsuit is perfect.

      "body": "<h2><strong>GOOD OMENS</strong></h2> <p>Having won two Premier League titles, two Fizzy Cups and represented the Republic of Ireland more than 100 times, you could be forgiven for presuming that leading Shelbourne to the Irish title would rank somewhere between winning the Community Shield and getting relegated with Fulham among Damien Duff\u2019s list of footballing achievements. Famously described as \u201cthe problem child\u201d of the FAI by former chief suit John Delaney, who was far more problematic and childish than the tournament he was belittling, the League of Ireland Premier Division is endearingly tinpot through no great fault of its own. It has long been the subject of extreme financial neglect by both the organisation that runs it and a government who make little or no effort to help it thrive, although in recent years and due in no small part to the arrival of \u201cDuffer\u201d, its popularity continues to grow in the face of fierce competition for Irish eyeballs from assorted other, better funded sports.</p> <p>League of Ireland stadiums tend towards the ramshackle.

      "bodyText": "GOOD OMENS Having won two Premier League titles, two Fizzy Cups and represented the Republic of Ireland more than 100 times, you could be forgiven for presuming that leading Shelbourne to the Irish title would rank somewhere between winning the Community Shield and getting relegated with Fulham among Damien Duff\u2019s list of footballing achievements. Famously described as \u201cthe problem child\u201d of the FAI by former chief suit John Delaney, who was far more problematic and childish than the tournament he was belittling, the League of Ireland Premier Division is endearingly tinpot through no great fault of its own. It has long been the subject of extreme financial neglect by both the organisation that runs it and a government who make little or no effort to help it thrive, although in recent years and due in no small part to the arrival of \u201cDuffer\u201d, its popularity continues to grow in the face of fierce competition for Irish eyeballs from assorted other, better funded sports. League of Ireland stadiums tend towards the ramshackle. Crowds are often low. The clubs who participate are heavily reliant on volunteers to put on games featuring players who enjoy all the trappings of English top-flight counterparts, who many Irish fans travel across the water to cheer on each weekend \u2026 except the high profiles, even higher wages and acclaim. But for those loyal diehards who click through the turnstiles each week to support teams like Shamrock Rovers, Derry City, Dundalk and Bohs, winning the league title or FAI Cup is the be-all and end-all.

There were three more solo LPs but nothing since a 2017 Christmas album, as Stefani focused on parenting her three sons. \u201cI don\u2019t go to the studio every day and just self-indulge in like: \u2018What do I have to say today?\u2019\u201d she told NME last month. \u201cIt\u2019s like: \u2018Hey, they\u2019re at school, I got three hours so let\u2019s see if I can get down there to write.\u2019\u201d But now she is preparing to release Bouquet, an album informed by yacht rock that also features a duet with her country singer husband, Blake Shelton. Ahead of its release, she\u2019ll join us to answer your questions \u2013 post them below before 4pm GMT on 7 November, and we\u2019ll publish her answers on 15 November, the day of Bouquet\u2019s release.",

      "body": "  <p>Steven Bartlett might be a visionary entrepreneur but he\u2019s all-too aware that having vision isn\u2019t enough on its own. As part of a partnership with Adobe Express, the quick and easy content app, he\u2019s now on a mission to show people how to turn their vision into actionable steps with the help of a carefully-conceived manifesto that aligns with their goals and values. Calling it the \u201cManifest-o Method\u201d, the idea is to provide a framework that can help guide entrepreneurs in their early stages. As he put it in an interview with Adobe: \u201cManifestation without action is like setting your car\u2019s sat-nav without turning the engine on.\u201d</p> <p>When creating the Manifest-o Method, Bartlett, who is probably best known for The Diary of a CEO podcast and his appearances on BBC Dragons\u2019 Den, drew on his own experience of creating and designing a business manifesto for his podcast company, Flight Studio, using Adobe Express.</p> <p>So how does a manifesto differ from an ordinary business plan \u2013 or, indeed a mission or vision statement? Adobe senior vice-president Claire Darley describes it as something with much more personal resonance. \u201cA manifesto goes beyond the structure of a conventional business plan,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a declaration of belief, intention and purpose \u2013 focused on aligning your thoughts and actions to bring your vision to life.\u201d It also draws heavily on the self-help idea of manifesting.</p> <p>Darley adds that while the concept of a manifesto is not new, Adobe\u2019s research suggests that today\u2019s business owners are harnessing the power of manifestos to stay focused on their goals. This is key because big goals, which are often a long way into the future, can feel daunting and unachievable. Bartlett has noted that seeing his goals visually helps make them \u201cmore tangible and less scary\u201d. He hopes that by developing a manifesto, people will be able to form daily habits that can edge them closer to their goals and make the journey less intimidating.</p> <p>Indeed, Bartlett has admitted that he has never written a business plan in his life, but instead has always written a mission and created a five-page vision deck. He turns these into a manifesto as the business in question develops, so that everyone is focused together.</p> <p>So what makes a good manifesto? Ideally, it should straddle both personal and business growth \u2013 conveying what you stand for and what you\u2019re trying to achieve. Framed as such, it can also serve as a daily reminder of why you set out on your path in the first place.</p> <p>But how do you start creating a manifesto if you\u2019ve never done one before? \u201cStart by reflecting on your core values, beliefs, and what you truly want to achieve,\u201d says Darley. \u201cA manifesto is essentially a declaration of intent, so begin by writing down your key goals and how you envision your life or business once those goals are achieved.\u201d She adds that it need not be long or complex. Rather, you should take 10 minutes and aim for five powerful statements that define what you stand for and what your goals are.</p>    <p>Bartlett\u2019s advice is to keep manifestos punchy. You should distil your beliefs and translate them into productive behaviour and your manifesto should include what makes you different and distinctive. Finally, your manifesto should be visual and well-designed. This has a number of benefits. The work you put into designing it can arguably give the words more heft. Humans have long understood this \u2013 think about the mottos emblazoned on medieval coats of arms. There has also been interesting <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14733285.2021.1965089#abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">research</a> into the effect of laminating certain documents or objects. The study in question found that<strong> </strong>the process of laminating can make things feel more solid, important and true. Respondents said that the laminated documents and objects felt more valuable because they were more durable. In the same vein, a carefully-designed manifesto will arguably feel much more durable than a motto or affirmation scrawled on a Post-It note.</p> <p>Today, it\u2019s easy and fun to design something that stands out thanks to the rise of creative digital tools, such as Adobe Express with its suite of intuitive tools, video and animation functions, and generative-AI features.</p> <p>Of course, there will be an element of trial and error. You may discover your manifesto doesn\u2019t work as you\u2019d hoped it would, or that factors beyond your control mean that it needs altering. So you should revisit it regularly and ask if it\u2019s driving actions that bring you closer to your goals. If this isn\u2019t happening or the manifesto feels tired and no longer inspiring, you should update it. Refine your goals, clarify your intentions and break down larger objectives into smaller, easier-to-implement steps. \u201cManifesting requires both patience and adaptability,\u201d says Darley. \u201cContinuously reassess, and adjust your approach as needed, to ensure your manifesto remains a dynamic tool for growth.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, the applicability of the Manifest-o Method is not limited to business. Once you get the hang of things, you may decide to create multiple manifestos. Bartlett has stressed how it can also be beneficial for your personal life, helping you clarify your values and priorities and stay focused on what truly matters.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://servedby.flashtalking.com/click/1/250188;8780127;4938337;211;0/?gdpr=$%7BGDPR%7D&amp;gdpr_consent=$%7BGDPR_CONSENT_78%7D&amp;us_privacy=$%7BUS_PRIVACY%7D&amp;url=39967968\" rel=\"nofollow\">Find out more</a> about Adobe Express</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>It was a very good weekend for Liverpool, and a pretty good weekend for the Premier League. It\u2019s one round of games, and blips and quirks do happen. But that three of the top four on Saturday morning could lose felt not only invigorating \u2013 maybe this isn\u2019t a league entirely predetermined by how much money you have \u2013 but also, perhaps, part of a pattern.</p> <p>And that pattern is of football that is a bit patchy, a bit scratchy, a bit lacking the sort of fluidity and quality we\u2019ve become used to, which is perhaps not so good. Mois\u00e9s Caicedo\u2019s equaliser aside, Chelsea\u2019s draw at Manchester United in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/03/manchester-united-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Sunday\u2019s showpiece</a> was an extremely limited game. The sense this autumn has been of a lot of sides packed with good players not playing particularly well.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/04/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action\">Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend\u2019s action</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Aston Villa\u2019s defeat at Tottenham brought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/03/tottenham-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\">the most spectacular scoreline, 4-1</a>, but was in some ways the least noteworthy of the three defeats for sides near the top. Brilliant as they have been under Unai Emery, there has been for a while an expectation of a reset, if only because the demands of the Champions League, particularly on a squad that is not used to balancing European and Premier League demands \u2013 even if their manager is \u2013 are so intense.</p> <p>After conceding late to draw at home to Bournemouth last week and then losing to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday, it wasn\u2019t the greatest surprise that they should also drop points at Tottenham. What was unexpected was the manner in which Spurs tore them apart in the second half. Perhaps it was just a case of Villa opening up as they chased the game and being picked off by wildly inconsistent opponents having a good day, but it was impossible not to wonder whether fatigue might be a factor.</p> <p>Arsenal\u2019s woes are well-known <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/02/newcastle-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">and defeat</a> at Newcastle was no great surprise. The loss of Martin \u00d8degaard has affected their balance in midfield but seems also to have hit them psychologically \u2013 as though they cannot quite conceive the possibility of playing well without him. They have already dropped 12 points this season. Given a good rule of thumb is that a side hoping to win the title must take 90 points, that places their title challenge in severe doubt; they effectively have only 12 more points they can drop in the 28 games they have remaining.</p> <p>But perhaps this season it won\u2019t take 90 points to win the league, and not just because of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/20/win-or-lose-manchester-city-case-poses-perilous-threat-to-the-premier-league\">potential points deduction</a> hanging over Manchester City. City\u2019s 32-game Premier League unbeaten record <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/02/bournemouth-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">came to an end</a> at Bournemouth on Saturday \u2013 a stat that should in itself give pause; teams really shouldn\u2019t be able to go the equivalent of 85% of a league season unbeaten, or certainly not in the manner City have, with a weary sigh and nobody paying much attention.</p> <p>Bournemouth deserve their own recognition in this; their last three games have been against Arsenal (home), Villa (away) and City (home) and they have taken seven points from them. As Pep Guardiola said on Saturday, \u201cWe couldn\u2019t match the intensity.\u201d That is credit to Andoni Iraola and his excellent Bournemouth who, after a wobbly start, have hit a fine run of form, inspired by Antoine Semenyo.</p> <p>But City, in truth, have been uneasy for a while. Five times already in the league this season, they have conceded the first goal in a game, and they struggled to beat Fulham, Brentford, Wolves and Southampton. This is not the control to which Guardiola aspires. He complained about a season that, with the Club World Cup next summer, could stretch to 70 games \u2013 \u201clike the NBA, but the NBA has four-month holidays and we have three weeks \u2026 When that happens, you have injuries for a long time.\u201d</p> <p>And, of course, in that he is quite right: top players are expected to play too much. City are missing Rodri and Kevin De Bruyne. Arsenal can legitimately point to their injury list as well. To which there is an obvious response: stop playing so many games. It\u2019s the clubs who have driven the expansion of the Champions League, the clubs who go on lengthy pre-season tours, the clubs who have the power to refuse to play in the Club World Cup. To greedily take the money and then complain about the consequences \u2013 while, for instance, abolishing replays in the early rounds of the FA Cup, denying smaller clubs much-needed revenue \u2013 is illogical and distasteful.</p> <p>The consequences for the league, though, could be fascinating. City did have a wobble in November last year, going on a run of one win in six Premier League games before winning 17 of their final 20, so nobody should be drawing any firm conclusions, but there is a possibility that this could be an old-fashioned season in which the elite do not just chomp remorselessly through opponents, but actually have to battle.</p> <p>It\u2019s appalling that the cost is injuries to players, expected to push their bodies beyond the limit. But, if that can be left aside \u2013 and perhaps it can\u2019t \u2013 on a more abstract level a dip in quality may be worth it if the narrative drama improves, an awful paradox into which the economic model of modern football has forced the game.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/20/sign-up-for-soccer-with-jonathan-wilson-his-free-weekly-newsletter-on-european-soccer\">Subscribe for free here.</a> </strong>Have a question for Jonathan?

But that three of the top four on Saturday morning could lose felt not only invigorating \u2013 maybe this isn\u2019t a league entirely predetermined by how much money you have \u2013 but also, perhaps, part of a pattern. And that pattern is of football that is a bit patchy, a bit scratchy, a bit lacking the sort of fluidity and quality we\u2019ve become used to, which is perhaps not so good. Mois\u00e9s Caicedo\u2019s equaliser aside, Chelsea\u2019s draw at Manchester United in Sunday\u2019s showpiece was an extremely limited game. The sense this autumn has been of a lot of sides packed with good players not playing particularly well. Aston Villa\u2019s defeat at Tottenham brought the most spectacular scoreline, 4-1, but was in some ways the least noteworthy of the three defeats for sides near the top. Brilliant as they have been under Unai Emery, there has been for a while an expectation of a reset, if only because the demands of the Champions League, particularly on a squad that is not used to balancing European and Premier League demands \u2013 even if their manager is \u2013 are so intense. After conceding late to draw at home to Bournemouth last week and then losing to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday, it wasn\u2019t the greatest surprise that they should also drop points at Tottenham. What was unexpected was the manner in which Spurs tore them apart in the second half. Perhaps it was just a case of Villa opening up as they chased the game and being picked off by wildly inconsistent opponents having a good day, but it was impossible not to wonder whether fatigue might be a factor. Arsenal\u2019s woes are well-known and defeat at Newcastle was no great surprise. The loss of Martin \u00d8degaard has affected their balance in midfield but seems also to have hit them psychologically \u2013 as though they cannot quite conceive the possibility of playing well without him. They have already dropped 12 points this season. Given a good rule of thumb is that a side hoping to win the title must take 90 points, that places their title challenge in severe doubt; they effectively have only 12 more points they can drop in the 28 games they have remaining. But perhaps this season it won\u2019t take 90 points to win the league, and not just because of the potential points deduction hanging over Manchester City. City\u2019s 32-game Premier League unbeaten record came to an end at Bournemouth on Saturday \u2013 a stat that should in itself give pause; teams really shouldn\u2019t be able to go the equivalent of 85% of a league season unbeaten, or certainly not in the manner City have, with a weary sigh and nobody paying much attention. Bournemouth deserve their own recognition in this; their last three games have been against Arsenal (home), Villa (away) and City (home) and they have taken seven points from them. As Pep Guardiola said on Saturday, \u201cWe couldn\u2019t match the intensity.\u201d That is credit to Andoni Iraola and his excellent Bournemouth who, after a wobbly start, have hit a fine run of form, inspired by Antoine Semenyo. But City, in truth, have been uneasy for a while. Five times already in the league this season, they have conceded the first goal in a game, and they struggled to beat Fulham, Brentford, Wolves and Southampton. This is not the control to which Guardiola aspires. He complained about a season that, with the Club World Cup next summer, could stretch to 70 games \u2013 \u201clike the NBA, but the NBA has four-month holidays and we have three weeks \u2026 When that happens, you have injuries for a long time.\u201d And, of course, in that he is quite right: top players are expected to play too much. City are missing Rodri and Kevin De Bruyne. Arsenal can legitimately point to their injury list as well. To which there is an obvious response: stop playing so many games. It\u2019s the clubs who have driven the expansion of the Champions League, the clubs who go on lengthy pre-season tours, the clubs who have the power to refuse to play in the Club World Cup. To greedily take the money and then complain about the consequences \u2013 while, for instance, abolishing replays in the early rounds of the FA Cup, denying smaller clubs much-needed revenue \u2013 is illogical and distasteful. The consequences for the league, though, could be fascinating. City did have a wobble in November last year, going on a run of one win in six Premier League games before winning 17 of their final 20, so nobody should be drawing any firm conclusions, but there is a possibility that this could be an old-fashioned season in which the elite do not just chomp remorselessly through opponents, but actually have to battle. It\u2019s appalling that the cost is injuries to players, expected to push their bodies beyond the limit. But, if that can be left aside \u2013 and perhaps it can\u2019t \u2013 on a more abstract level a dip in quality may be worth it if the narrative drama improves, an awful paradox into which the economic model of modern football has forced the game.

The country\u2019s defence minister, P\u00e5l Jonson, said on Monday that the government had rejected plans for all but one of 14 windfarms planned along the east coast. The decision comes after the Swedish armed forces concluded last week that the projects would make it more difficult to defend Nato\u2019s newest member. \u201cThe government believes that it would lead to unacceptable consequences for Sweden\u2019s defence to build the current projects in the Baltic Sea area,\u201d Jonson said at a press conference. The proposed windfarms would have been located between \u00c5land, the autonomous Finnish region between Sweden and Finland, and the Sound, the strait between southern Sweden and Denmark. The Russian exclave of Kaliningrad is only about 310 miles (500km) from Stockholm. Wind power could affect Sweden\u2019s defence capabilities across sensors and radars and make it harder to detect submarines and possible attacks from the air if war broke out, Jonson said. The only project to receive the green light to was Poseidon, which will include as many as 81 wind turbines to produce 5.5 terawatt hours a year off Stenungsund on Sweden\u2019s west coast. \u201cBoth ballistic robots and also cruise robots are a big problem if you have offshore wind power,\u201d Jonson said. \u201cIf you have a strong signal detection capability and a radar system that is important, we use the Patriot system for example, there would be negative consequences if there were offshore wind power in the way of the sensors.\u201d A Nato maritime commander said earlier this year that the security of nearly a billion people across Europe and North America was under threat from Russian attempts to target the extensive vulnerabilities of underwater infrastructure, including windfarms, which he said had \u201csystem vulnerabilities\u201d.

      "bodyText": "May I add to the obituary of Fleur Adcock by mentioning her many collaborations with the composer Dame Gillian Whitehead, her friend and fellow New Zealander? They met in 1979 and were to collaborate seven times. Notable were the two theatrical chamber works, Hotspur (1980) and Eleanor of Aquitaine (1982). These led to two large orchestral monodramas \u2013 Out of This Nettle, Danger (1983), for which Adcock assembled texts of Katherine Mansfield, and Alice (2002), in which Adcock drew on the life of her great-aunt. Other composers, myself included, have been drawn to setting Adcock\u2019s poetry, but Whitehead was her friend and closest collaborator.",

That would strengthen the US dollar.</p> <p>The dollar\u2019s decline on Monday \u2013 down 0.6% so far \u2013 has come in response to polls suggesting that Harris\u2019s odds are slightly better than previously thought. But it is still a toss-up.</p> <p><strong>Rupert Thompson</strong>, chief economist at <strong>Iboss</strong>, a financial adviser, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Trump remains the favourite at this stage although it remains far too close to call, particularly as the polls over the weekend showed some move back towards Harris.</p> <p>If Harris wins, the reaction might well be a collective yawn, except for the fact that any victory would no doubt be very close and subject to vehement challenge by Trump and his supporters. She would be very unlikely to gain a clean sweep (ie the Democrats control Congress as well as the Presidency) severely limiting her ability to enact her plans to cut taxes and increase spending.</p> <p>If Trump wins, the market reaction is more uncertain. Again, it will partly depend on whether he gains a clean sweep which is more likely for Trump than Harris. If he doesn\u2019t, this would constrain his room to cut taxes but not alter his ability to increase tariffs. A Trump victory is likely to lead to a rather stronger dollar and higher government bond yields because his plans to raise tariffs sharply would boost inflation and reduce the willingness of the Fed to reduce rates.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jonas Goltermann</strong>, deputy chief markets economist at <strong>Capital Economics</strong>, a consultancy, wrote that \u201cwhatever the outcome\u201d this week is \u201clikely to prove volatile\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We think the near-term effect of a Trump win would be a stronger dollar, especially if accompanied by Republican control of Congress, while a Harris win would lead to a weaker greenback.

The Covid-19 crisis is still leaving its mark here.

      "bodyText": "There is the deep uncertainty over the US election result, with most respected probability models showing a 50/50 chance of Kamala Harris or Donald Trump triumphing. But what economists do mostly agree on is that a Trump victory would likely be inflationary. That would strengthen the US dollar. The dollar\u2019s decline on Monday \u2013 down 0.6% so far \u2013 has come in response to polls suggesting that Harris\u2019s odds are slightly better than previously thought. But it is still a toss-up. Rupert Thompson, chief economist at Iboss, a financial adviser, said: Trump remains the favourite at this stage although it remains far too close to call, particularly as the polls over the weekend showed some move back towards Harris. If Harris wins, the reaction might well be a collective yawn, except for the fact that any victory would no doubt be very close and subject to vehement challenge by Trump and his supporters. She would be very unlikely to gain a clean sweep (ie the Democrats control Congress as well as the Presidency) severely limiting her ability to enact her plans to cut taxes and increase spending. If Trump wins, the market reaction is more uncertain. Again, it will partly depend on whether he gains a clean sweep which is more likely for Trump than Harris. If he doesn\u2019t, this would constrain his room to cut taxes but not alter his ability to increase tariffs. A Trump victory is likely to lead to a rather stronger dollar and higher government bond yields because his plans to raise tariffs sharply would boost inflation and reduce the willingness of the Fed to reduce rates. Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics, a consultancy, wrote that \u201cwhatever the outcome\u201d this week is \u201clikely to prove volatile\u201d. We think the near-term effect of a Trump win would be a stronger dollar, especially if accompanied by Republican control of Congress, while a Harris win would lead to a weaker greenback. That would be in line with what happened immediately after the last two US elections. You can continue to follow our coverage from around the world \u2013 including the last day for Harris and Trump to make their mark: In the US, Harris and Trump converge on the rust belt on final day of campaigning In the UK, Labour is set to raise tuition fees amid deepening university financial crisis In our coverage of the Middle East crisis, Israel claims to have killed Hezbollah commander inside Lebanon Thank you for following today, and please do join us tomorrow for more live coverage of financial markets as we brace for the US election result. JJ Wall Street is in wait-and-see mode ahead of tomorrow\u2019s US election: there is barely any movement on the major stock indices. Here are the opening snaps, via Reuters: S&amp;P 500 UP 0.84 POINTS, OR 0.01%, AT 5,729.64 NASDAQ DOWN 18.20 POINTS, OR 0.10%, AT 18,221.71 DOW JONES DOWN 45.20 POINTS, OR 0.11%, AT 42,006.99 The US dollar is on course for its biggest one-day fall since 24 September \u2013 six weeks ago. Since then the value of the dollar has risen by about 3% as traders have adjusted to what seemed increasingly likely to be a victory for Donald Trump. But it should be stressed that this is all conjecture by a lot of investors with different opinions, and mostly without any special insight into who will win the election. Some foreign exchange watchers are just waiting for that uncertainty to be gone\u2026 Donald Trump is expected to increase US government borrowing, prompting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. That has meant a Trump win has become associated with a stronger dollar. That has also meant that the stregnth of the dollar in recent weeks appears to have been closely tied to his prospects in tomorrow\u2019s presidential election. Recent polls suggest that Kamala Harris has found more momentum. Kit Juckes, a strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, an investment bank, has this handy graph showing the correlation between moves in betting odds for a Trump victory and the US dollar. The shift back in the dollar reflects the deep uncertainty over the outcome, Juckes said: The betting market, which had diverged from opinion polls which never showed a clear outcome, is correcting and that would tend to imply dollar weakness into the vote. Likewise, the futures positioning has switched to a decent-sized long dollar position as of last Tuesday. There is some room the for the market to get closer to flat, and the dollar to fall, but that too could be achieved by the end of today! A Trump \u2018clean sweep\u2019 and a Harris win without a clean sweep remains the two most likely outcomes, in our view, and equally likely. These are the most bullish and most bearish outcomes for the dollar, respectively. David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, a spreadbetting website, said: The greenback continues to pull back from the three month highs hit last week. The dollar index was trading above 104.00 last Monday, but it has lost around 1% since then. This comes despite some huge swings on Friday which came in the wake of an unexpectedly-large decline in US non-farm payrolls. The dollar weakness is also indicative of uncertainty ahead of tomorrow\u2019s presidential election, as investors trim their positions with the polls too close to predict a winner. Post Office redress scheme manager Simon Recaldin said that the current projection is that the Post Office will ultimately pay out around \u00a31.4bn to settle all claims regarding Horizon. Last week, chancellor Rachel Reeves said that the government has \u00a31.8bn set aside to cover all claims. The current redress schemes exclude applications from managers and assistants at branches run by subpostmasters, as they do not have a direct contract with the Post Office. Recaldin said that he understood that the government is currently considering whether to extend the criteria. He added that there is not enough money set aside to cover potential payouts if the eligibility criteria are extended to cover those staff who may have claims. He also repeated the view held by Nick Read, outgoing chief executive of the Post Office, that the organisation should not be handling the redress schemes. Recaldin, who has worked at the Post Office since January 2022, said that his view is that there is a \u201creal danger of a conflict of interest\u201d with the organisation operating as \u201cjudge, jury and witness\u201d. There was clear direction from the government that there has to be a degree of accountability here [for the Post Office], and that it was feet to the fire time. The Post Office expects to have paid out more than \u00a3650m in compensation to subpostmasters by next March, after the ITV series about the Horizon IT scandal resulted in a huge spike in claims, the inquiry has heard. Simon Recaldin, the head of the four redress schemes the Post Office runs, has said the organisation has so far paid out \u00a3302m. He said that there has been a \u201cclear acceleration\u201d in the number of claims made by Post Office owner operators this year and the organisation expects to pay out a further \u00a3500m in the financial year to the end of March 2026. Alan Bates, the central figure leading the drive for justice for hundreds of subpostmasters in the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office, has said he will once again consider taking legal action if all claims are not resolved by March next year. The inquiry saw documents from a Post Office board meeting in March that showed it had received 1,146 late applications to its redress schemes, with 697 coming following the airing of the damning drama in January that brought the plight of subpostmasters to national attention. The Post Office officially stopped taking applications for its schemes in late November 2020. However, it moved to continue taking \u201clate\u201d applications from the end of 2022. Recaldin said: I\u2019m very grateful for the TV drama to have raised the issue [and prompted more applications. The peak in activity is absolutely the result of the ITV drama. The Post Office has been heavily criticised for the way it has handled redress for subpostmasters, with former chair Henry Staunton saying that his view was the remediation department acted in a \u201cbureaucratic and unsympathetic\u201d way. The share price of NatWest Group has hit its highest level in 13 years after an upgrade from a broker. NatWest, formerly Royal Bank of Scotland, rose 3% on Monday to a height of \u00a33.89 per share, its highest since 2011 when the bank was dealing with the repercussions from an enormous government bailout. It came after Peel Hunt upgraded its price target from \u00a34.10 to \u00a34.50. Peel Hunt said NatWest\u2019s premium was justified by its current momentum, the scale of earnings upgrades, profitability and low direct exposure to some UK legal and regulatory issues which are causing uncertainty \u2013 notably the motor finance debacle that is rocking several lenders \u2013 according to Reuters. NatWest (or rather RBS) shares peaked at more than \u00a355 before the financial crisis of 2008, before crashing as low as 90p as the extent of its overreach became clear. It fell below \u00a31 again during the coronavirus pandemic, but has recovered particularly strongly during 2024, helped by higher interest rates. The Thames Water creditors have given other investors until 11 November to join them, as they revealed for the first time that they have a coordinating committee acting together. The \u00a31.5bn in rescue money would tide the company over until October 2025, but it would still need to sort out the longer-term need to raise money needed to put Thames Water on a sustainable financial footing. It is risky proposition: the lenders acknowledge that finding billions of pounds of new equity capital will require the company to battle with Ofwat, the regulator, to allow it to charge customers more. The creditor group\u2019s spokesperson said: This agreement will ensure the company remains liquid and will support efforts to identify new, strategic equity, execute a successful turnaround and build a more resilient Thames which can deliver for the customers and the environment in the long term. However, attracting billions in new equity capital relies on there being an investable final determination that addresses the gap between Ofwat\u2019s draft determination and the company\u2019s forecast costs. Thames Water lenders have called for more investors to join a \u00a31.5bn cash injection to try to help the struggling utility to survive for another year. The cluster of investment giants including BlackRock, Abrdn and M&amp;G, which drew up the funding plans, have already agreed to backstop the fundraise, which effectively guarantees Thames Water can keep operating until October 2025, PA reports. Thames Water, which provides water and sewerage services to London and the Thames valley in south-east England, has been struggling to win new backing over a months-long crisis. US hedge fund Elliott Investment Management, plus investment firms Apollo Global Management and Silver Point Capital are also among the 100 investors in the group. But the group, which collectively holds about \u00a312bn in so-called class A debt of Thames Water, issued the plea on Monday for more firms to take part in the deal, which would bring down costs for them. The statement is partly aimed at a secondary group of firms which also hold a portion of Thames Water\u2018s debt - thought to be about \u00a31 billion of riskier, class B bonds. The class B bondholders drew up a rival fundraising plan last week, but it was not endorsed by the utility company. However, the two groups of bondholders are at loggerheads, with the class B group claiming Thames was letting itself fall victim to \u201cvulture rates\u201d on its borrowing that would be unsustainable. A spokesman for the creditor group said the funding deal is \u201ca critical step in stabilising the company\u201d. This facility is open to all creditors and we want as many institutions as possible to support the company\u2019s turnaround efforts. Our creditor group is working intensively with the company to develop a plan that will ultimately lead to a restructuring that unlocks billions of pounds in new investment capital and helps deliver the improved service that customers and the environment deserve. We want to work constructively with all parties to give Thames the best opportunity to attract the new equity it needs and allow for a full recapitalisation and successful turnaround. The US dollar has fallen in value after US presidential election polls over the weekend shifted towards Kamala Harris. The dollar is down by 0.6% against a trade-weighted basket of currencies. The index fell to its lowest level in two weeks. The dollar had risen in value over the course of October as polls appeared to indicate a higher probability of Donald Trump winning the election. Under the \u201cTrump trade\u201d some investors think that the Republican\u2019s policies would push up inflation, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Higher returns on US assets would then make the dollar more attractive. The pound rose by 0.4% against the US dollar on Monday to reach $1.2975, while the euro rose by 0.7% to $1.0910. In practice the election is too close to call with any certainty on the final day of the campaign. While Harris leads Trump in most national polls, Trump leads in several swing states \u2013 but by less than two percentage points. Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at Ebury, a foreign exchange business, said: We think that Trump\u2019s emphasis on a lower tax economy could lead to higher disposable incomes and greater consumer spending in the near-term. US growth may be initially stronger in light of the aforementioned tax plans, provided he is able to pass any bills through Congress. On balance, we think that a Trump election win would be bullish for the US dollar. While the prospect of higher US inflation could have damaging ramifications for medium-term growth, we think that markets will primarily react by pricing in a higher terminal Federal Reserve interest rate. The increased risk of a US protectionism-induced slowdown in global growth could also lead to a worsening in risk appetite and increased safe-haven flows into the dollar, as would heightened geopolitical risks under the Trump administration. James Dyson, one of the richest men in Britain, has described Labour\u2019s budget as \u201cspiteful\u201d in its increases in inheritance tax. In a column published by the Times, Dyson said the changes were a \u201csingle ignorant swipe at aspiration\u201d, \u201ckilling off established family businesses, and any incentive to start new ones\u201d by imposing 20% tax on businesses and farms worth more than \u00a31m. Those taxes would likely impact Dyson\u2019s estate after he dies, as he is one of the largest landowners in Britain and is listed as the owner of Dyson Farming, the company that owns 36,000 acres of farmland (although his 900-word article does not refer to the inheritance tax bills that may be liable on his estate). The core of Dyson\u2019s argument is that family businesses make decisions that are better for the country, and that heirs should therefore not be taxed when they inherit assets. Dyson wrote: Family businesses are an antidote to the short-termism which is the blight of the British economy and of which everyone complains. Family businesses are in the blood: a shared journey between the business and the family across the generations. Britain will sorely miss them. The wealth of Dyson and his family was estimated this year at \u00a320.8bn, according to the Sunday Times. In Germany the manufacturing recession has been particularly marked \u2013 a major problem for the EU considering its massive size. Carmakers in particular have reported difficulties, and the automotive industry\u2019s troubles were also behind the fall in confidence from other businesses. Among the most notable strugglers is Volkswagen, which has told worker representatives that it may close three German factories \u2013 the first ever closures in its home market. S&amp;P Global, which compiles the PMI surveys, said: The respective rates of contraction remained sharp by historical standards, amid reports from panellists of headwinds to demand from economic and political uncertainty, high interest rates and troubles in the automotive sector. European manufacturing\u2019s downturn has lasted 28 months, according to today\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). The overall picture is of anb industry that is really struggling, with little sign of good news, according to economists. Melanie Debono, senior Europe economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, said there was \u201clittle to suggest the rut in industry is ending\u201d. Overall, the manufacturing PMI remains downbeat. It has underestimated growth in manufacturing in recent quarters so we doubt industrial production will have fallen as much as it suggests in Q4, but we look for a renewed fall in output nonetheless. By country, weakness is concentrated in Germany Yet it is a continent in two halves, said from Boudewijn Driedonks, partner at McKinsey &amp; Co, a consultancy. He said: Europe\u2019s manufacturing sector stands at a critical juncture, balancing newfound momentum in the south with deepening challenges in the north. Traditional powerhouses like France and Germany continue to experience declines, as northern Europe faces challenges to reclaim its competitive edge. Also, Italy is seeing output falling at a faster pace than in September. Spain is structurally on a different outlook. It is in solid expansion territory and is bumping up the overall number with its healthy order book. Greece \u2013 the second country with a PMI above 50 \u2013 is hiring and expanding output, but at the same time, is seeing new orders declining. A quick check-in on gilt markets: after a bit of turbulence last week following the UK budget, trading appears to have settled. The yield on UK benchmark 10-year bonds (aka 10-year gilts) is at 4.48%, up from 4.45% on Friday. That suggests that some investors have sold UK government debt today, but a move of three basis points (0.03 percentage points) is not particularly notable in bond market terms. Yields move inversely to prices. So for now \u2013 let\u2019s see what happens tomorrow in the US elections \u2013 there does not appear to be any sign of the bond market turmoil that followed the 2022 \u201cmini-budget\u201d of Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng. But yields have certainly moved higher, reflecting higher borrowing from the UK government. More borrowing means more bond issuance, which generally makes prices fall. That raises the question of what the Bank of England will do in response. Markets appear to be thinking the Bank will be slower to cut rates. Andrew Wishart, senior UK economist at Berenberg, an investment bank, said: It is customary for the BoE to brush off changes in fiscal policy, but it would have to be tone deaf to do that this time around. Monetary policymakers will surely have to take notice of the Office for Budget Responsibility explicitly raising its interest rate assumptions 25 basis points above market pricing to account for the likely market reaction to the change in the fiscal stance. By raising the 10-year gilt yield from 4.32% at the pre-budget close to 4.46%, financial markets have done as they were told. It is time for the BoE to follow. Berenberg now thinks that the Bank will make one cut less, ending up at 4.25% bank rate in the second quarter of 2025, instead of 4.0% in the third quarter. Ryanair also had another pop at the UK government after chancellor Rachel Reeves announced increased air passenger duty at the budget last week. Sorahan said that it was a \u201cbackward step\u201d for the UK to raise taxes on air fares, which he said would hurt regional economies. Reeves said that the tax increase was brought in because the levy had not increased in line with inflation. The duty is also partly aimed at taxing aviation\u2019s carbon emissions, which have risen inexorably as carriers like Ryanair have grown. Ryanair is the biggest aviation carbon polluter in Europe, with emissions rivalling the largest coal plants. Sorahan said: The new government in the UK said they would stimulate growth, but they\u2019re making it more expensive [to fly]. The government missed a huge opportunity in cost [going up]. I think it\u2019ll have a big impact on the regions. However, Sorahan acknowledged that the duty increase will only kick in in 2026, so it was not directly linked to Ryanair\u2019s decision, announced last week, to cut UK flights by 10% next year. Ryanair believes that airline fares are more likely to rise than to fall in the next two years. Neil Sorahan, the Irish airline\u2019s finance chief, said that \u201cthe decline in fares appears to be moderating\u201d, and that they are planning for \u201cslightly lower growth which lead into slightly higher pricing\u201d. Consumers have had less money to spend because of the rapid increase in interest rates, said Sorahan. But the bigger picture is of a European industry that has more demand for flights than it can satisfy, he told the Guardian. Part of that is the Boeing delays but also issues with Pratt &amp; Whitney engines supplied to Airbus, he said: Fundamentally capacity remains constrained across Europe for some time to come. Fundamentally there\u2019s more risk to fares going up than fares going down in the next year or two. Ryanair\u2019s share price is down by 2.4% today in Dublin, after the no-frills carrier said cut back growth expectations. Neil Sorahan, Ryanair\u2019s chief financial officer, said that Boeing\u2019s delays to deliveries of new planes were holding it back. Boeing workers are voting on a new pay deal that \u2013 if they vote for it \u2013 would put an end to weeks of strike action. Speaking about the slower growth expectations, Sorahan said: This is on the back of the ongoing Boeing delivery delays. We hope they\u2019ll sort it out tonight. I hope there is a normal to get back to. I\u2019m hopeful the vote gets over the line tonight. Two big elections for me to watch this week. But even if Boeing\u2019s workers do accept the pay offer \u2013 the third to be put to a vote \u2013 it is \u201cslow to turn back on\u201d one of the most complex supply chains in the world, said Sorahan. It will be \u201ca few weeks, if not a few months\u201d before Boeing disruption is sorted, said Sorahan, and Ryanair does not expect to receive any new planes before January or even February. As to that other election, Ryanair does not fly to the US, but \u201cI\u2019m just hoping from a market perspective that there\u2019s a strong decision one way or another,\u201d Sorahan said. Europe\u2019s manufacturing production fell for the 19th month in a row in October, but with some tentative signs that the painful recession may be easing, according to the closely watched purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). The index rose slightly to 46 points in October, up from 45 in September, according to data company S&amp;P Global. However, that was still well below the 50 mark that denotes growth in the sector. European factories have been held back by the two heavyweights: France and Germany. France\u2019s reading was a meagre 44.5, while Germany\u2019s was even worse, at 43 \u2013 although that was an improvement from the dire state of the past few months. Manufacturing in Europe has struggled for two years as exports have waned, demand has fallen, and supply chain problems have held back companies from taking advantage when demand is there. The recession in German industry is particularly noteworthy, with the car industry under severe pressure from Chinese competitors and several chipmaking investments put on hold. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, which sponsors the survey, said: There is one bit of good news in these numbers: the recession in the manufacturing sector did not deepen further in October. Production dropped at a slower pace than in the previous month, and new orders fell less sharply. It is not encouraging that inventory drawdowns for purchased materials continue at an unusually high pace. The Covid-19 crisis is still leaving its mark here. The ongoing reduction in inventories is obviously related to the fact that companies purchased and stockpiled materials and intermediate goods at an unprecedented scale in 2021 and 2022. Sluggish global demand gives companies no reason to restock, which in turn weighs on the economy. Burberry is the biggest riser on the FTSE 350 this morning after a report that expensive puffer jacket brand Moncler is considering making a bid for the British fashion champion. Shares in Burberry are up by 5% after industry blog Miss Tweed yesterday reported that \u201cMoncler could be considering making a bid for London-listed Burberry to create an outdoor specialist giant\u201d. Among Burberry\u2019s most famous products are its trench coats, so a takeover would make a combined company a formidable force in the \u00a32,000-plus coat business. Burberry could be vulnerable to a takeover as newly installed chief executive Joshua Schulman tries to turn its fortunes around amid limp demand for luxury items \u2013 and to return it to the FTSE 100. The FTSE 100 in London is up by 0.4% in early trading on Monday. That\u2019s the best of an underwhelming bunch across Europe \u2013 likely as everyone holds their breath ahead of Tuesday\u2019s US election. The FTSE 100 also tends to benefit from higher oil prices thanks to the weight of Shell and BP in the index. Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.1%, while France\u2019s Cac 40 has edged up. Shares in Milan have fallen by 0.2%, while Spain\u2019s Ibex is up by the same amount. Hello, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets. Oil prices have risen 2% after the Opec oil cartel and associate countries said they would delay an increase in output by a month, as they try to sustain prices despite relatively low demand. The price of Brent crude oil futures, the North Sea benchmark, rose as high as $74.56, up more than a dollar as trading reopened after the weekend. The price of West Texas Intermediate, the North American counterpart, rose 2% to $70.88. Oil prices have fallen during the second half of the year as some of the world\u2019s largest economies have faltered, depressing demand. At the same time, while Israel\u2019s war in Gaza against Hamas has also spread to the Hezbollah armed group in Lebanon, it has not so far threatened oil supplies directly. That has kept prices relatively low. Some key members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) plus other large producers including Russia had planned to increase output, but on Sunday they said they would not go ahead with it. Reuters reported: The December hike was due to be 180,000 bpd, a small part of the total 5.86m barrels per day of output Opec+ is holding back, equal to about 5.7% of global demand. Opec+ agreed those cuts in separate steps since 2022 to support the market. Ryanair profits fall after summer fare cuts Ryanair profits dropped by 18% to \u20ac1.8bn in the six months to the end of September, as the no-frills airline was forced to drop fares. Fares fell by 7% over the summer, Ryanair said on Monday, although it added that downward pressure on prices appeared to be \u201cmoderating\u201d. The airline disappointed investors over the summer with a profit warning as it was forced to cut fares. Ryanair chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary said the company had offered \u201cmore price stimulation than originally expected\u201d, although that had resulted in improved market share. Overall traffic rose by 9% in the six months compared with the same period last year. O\u2019Leary said: Forward bookings suggest that third-quarter demand is strong and the decline in pricing appears to be moderating. We remain cautious on the third quarter\u2019s average fare outlook, expecting them to be modestly lower than the third quarter prior year. The airline also gave one of its regular digs at Boeing. The US planemaker, which supplies all Ryanair aircraft, has struggled with major delays, including an ongoing strike that has held back deliveries of its bestselling planes. Ryanair said that compensation for late deliveries did not make up for 5m in extra passengers it could have carried.

From the Netherlands, where the backlash has been strongest, to Belgium, France, Spain, Ireland, Germany and the UK, protests have led to convoys of tractors clogging roads and ports, farmer-led occupations of capital cities and even cows being herded into the offices of government ministers.</p> <p>These movements have been fuelled by the genuine grievances of farmers, who say that the burden of paying more for their pollution is a step too far, after an energy crisis and pandemic left many struggling to make ends meet. They say they feel overburdened by rules and undervalued by city dwellers, who eat the food they grow without any interest in where it came from.</p> <p>Over the past few decades, the number of small farms across Europe has declined as conglomerates hoovered them up, while increased EU freedom of movement has led to a brain drain that has decimated rural communities.</p> <p>As a result of these factors, farmers have receivedincreasing support from a range of far-right and populist groups, from the Alternative for Germany party(AfD) to the Farmer-Citizen Movement (BBB) in the Netherlands. The European parliament elections in September led to a decided tilt to the right, with <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/european-parliament-election-far-right-b9339cf1a7d2067bf6fa1941c166936d#\">25% of MEPs now</a> from the hard right, the highest level ever recorded.</p> <p>Nick Lowles, the chief executive of the UK anti-racist group Hope Not Hate, said: \u201cWhat we have seen \u2026 should serve as a warning sign to the political classes \u2013 the necessary rapid transition to a low carbon, sustainable economy has to be properly funded, planned and equitable and not done at the expense of working people.\u201d</p> <p>Lowles, who works closely with anti-racist groups across the continent, said the stakes could hardly be higher with far-right and populists groups making big gains in the recent elections in the UK and Europe.</p> <p>He said: \u201cOur polling of 15,000 people across Europe shows people are fundamentally fed up with politics and politicians and do not trust that they are on their side. This makes it even more important that this transition [to a low carbon future] is done with people and for people and not something they feel is being imposed unfairly by a remote political class.\u201d</p> <p>According to the writer and academic Richard Seymour, whose latest book, Disaster Nationalism, examines how<strong> </strong>the far-right is capitalising on economic shocks and climate chaos, small farmers reeling from the blows of globalisation, a changing climate, and high energy prices is part of a wider trend.</p> <p>Seymour said: \u201cFor farmers there\u2019s all of this resentment requiring a target. But many of the things that are causing the harm \u2013 globalisation, capitalism, climate change \u2013 are abstract; you can\u2019t take climate change to court, you can\u2019t shoot globalisation \u2026 But conspiracy theories and far-right narratives allow you to identify some specific individuals or groups \u2013 cultural Marxists, globalists, Muslims \u2013 who are doing you down, that is the appeal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDownwardly mobile\u201d farmers \u2013 those that have seen their living standards and social standing decline during their lifetimes \u2013 are particularly susceptible, according to Seymour. \u201cThe toxic feeling of failure, the feeling of being buffeted by these global forces, the feeling you have been abandoned, betrayed, when you traditionally had some sort of status, that is a toxic mix and that is where the far right comes in.\u201d</p> <p>In the Netherlands the BBB, a rural conservative party established in 2019 which wants to restrict the power of the EU and rejects some of the environmental measures introduced by the Dutch government, now has two ministers in the national government. The Guardian repeatedly requested an interview with a representative of the party but no one was made available.</p> <p>In Spain, where heatwaves and droughts have turned olive oil into the most stolen supermarket good, the far-right Vox have used the protests to justify their opposition to the European Green Deal \u2013 saying it threatens the viability of rural areas that are quickly hollowing out, while in Germany, AfD and groups with even more extreme and anti-democratic views have expressed support for farmers and for the protests. In France, the far-right National Rallyseized on the protests in a campaign against \u201cpunitive ecology\u201d that scored them big wins in European elections but fell short of success in the snap national elections that followed.</p> <p>In the UK, the campaign group No Farmers, No Food, which argues against net zero targets, was started and is being run not by a farmer but by James Melville, a <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/media/gb-news\">GB News</a> pundit and communications consultant. Melville retweeted a post from the former LBC host Maajid Nawaz that said: \u201cFarmers stand between us and WEF\u2019s desire for us to EAT BUGS, own nothing and be happy.\u201d Melville also shared a post with a conspiracist claim that stated: \u201cBetween Bill Gates, the CCP &amp; the WEF, we\u2019re going to have no private farmland left.

Some of the biggest victims of the impacts of climate change will be farmers, and we need to frame our arguments to them in this manner.\u201d</p> <p>But scientists have warned that the debate has been mired in misinformation. The EU\u2019s nature restoration law, which barely scraped through the legislative process, was heavily watered down in an attempt to appease farmers.

Geraint Davies, who farms in the Snowdonia national park in Wales said: \u201cMost farmers understand that climate change is real but they see someone giving them the hope of ending every single policy that has been pushed towards agriculture \u2013 it\u2019s such a dangerous ground to go down really.\u201d</p> <p>Davies said climate change had been affecting his farm \u201cquite hard for the last four or five years which never used to happen\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEvery year there is a different scenario regarding the weather we have to tackle. These groups have tried to push a different agenda into farmers to steer them away from producing sustainable food.\u201d</p> <p> Davies added that many farmers felt isolated and ignored by society making them easy targets for conspiracy theories and populist narratives. \u201cIsolation is huge in farming and if someone gives you that glimmer of hope, telling you what you want to hear, you might think they are acting in your best interests, but actually it\u2019s about self promotion for their own causes.\u201d He said the answer was to \u201cpay farmers fairly, and give them clarity and pride in the role they must play in a well-planned, well-regulated green transition\u201d.</p> <p>Lowles said it was crucial mainstream parties were aware of the threat and ensured the green transition was fair and properly planned and funded.</p> <p>\u201cIf this warning is not heeded, we are in danger of seeing the continued rise of the far right in the coming years \u2013 with pretty grim consequences, not least the abandoning the climate agenda with all that entails for future generations.\u201d</p>",

He rushed home and began to dig. One by one, he pulled family members from the rubble, all eight of them killed in an Israeli airstrike. \u201cI pulled my brother out of the rubble in pieces.

The day before, Fadi\u2019s brother Ali had asked him if his family could stay at his house since they lived next to a petrol station and he feared it would blow up in the event of an Israeli bombing; a local family had burned to death in an earlier Israeli bombing and Ali did not want his wife and two children to suffer the same fate.

In a statement released on Monday morning, police in the Amazon city of Manaus announced they had concluded the two-year investigation into the shootings of the British journalist and the Brazilian Indigenous expert in June 2022. Police said their final report identified nine people who had played some role in killings that drew attention to the criminal assault on the world\u2019s largest tropical rainforest and the Indigenous communities that call that region home. Those alleged culprits included the main architect of the murders who police claimed \u201cprovided the rounds for the crime to be carried out, offered financial support to the criminal organisation\u2019s activities, and was involved in coordinating the concealment of the corpses of the victims\u201d. The statement did not name the alleged mastermind but multiple Brazilian press reports identified him as Ruben Dario da Silva Villar, an alleged illegal fishing and poaching boss from the border region where Phillips and Pereira were ambushed and shot. Silva Villar, whose nickname is Colombia, is in custody having been arrested in late 2022 for a different offence. He has denied involvement in the murders.

A spokesperson for the company, Trump Media, confirmed the outsourced jobs to ProPublica \u2013 whose report arrived amid the former US president\u2019s threats to impose steep tariffs on all items imported into the US, ostensibly to create more domestic jobs. Trump Media\u2019s workers in Mexico, which Trump claimed in 2015 was sending \u201cdrug dealers\u201d and \u201crapists\u201d to the US \u2013 produce code and perform other technical support, according to ProPublica. \u201cAnother entity\u201d hired these workers, the investigative outlet said. The outsourcing spurred a whistleblower letter to Trump Media\u2019s board of directors, which ProPublica reported on in October. Staff at Trump Media \u2013 which owns the Truth Social platform \u2013 was reportedly outraged by the company\u2019s use of overseas labor, believing that it flew in the face of its America first ideology. Notably, Trump had previously reportedly threatened enormous tariffs on cars made in Mexico, saying: \u201cI\u2019ll put 200[%] or 500[%] \u2013 I don\u2019t care.\u201d Upset Trump Media staff members also demanded the firing of their chief executive officer, the former Republican congressman Devin Nunes, claiming he ran the company poorly and had an \u201cAmerica last\u201d philosophy with hiring.

Trump Media\u2019s representative told ProPublica that there were \u201ctwo individual workers\u201d in Mexico and then railed against the outlet\u2019s reporting. \u201cPresenting the fact that [Trump Media] works with precisely two specialist contractors in Mexico as some sort of sensational scandal is just the latest in a long line of defamatory conspiracy theories invented by the serial fabricators at ProPublica,\u201d the spokesperson reportedly said. The ProPublica report came just three days before Tuesday\u2019s election between Trump and Kamala Harris for the White House. Throughout the campaign, Trump has gone on the attack against outsourcing, warning companies that there would be dire consequences if they moved jobs south of the border \u2013 and claiming at various times that his threats had protected US jobs.

But John Deere told several outlets that the company had neither changed its plan nor announced any policy change, as CNN reported.

No evidence shows immigrants to the US commit crimes at higher levels than people born with citizenship. And economic data does not support the claim that migrants are taking \u201call\u201d US jobs. Trump\u2019s most incendiary comments about immigrants in his campaign against Harris lied about how immigrants in Ohio were \u201ceating the dogs, the people that came in, they\u2019re eating the cats\u201d.

Simon Recaldin, the head of the four redress schemes the Post Office runs, told the public inquiry into the scandal that the state-owned body had so far paid out \u00a3302m after the hundreds of wrongful prosecutions that were based on evidence from the flawed IT system. He said there had been a \u201cclear acceleration\u201d in the number of claims made by post office operators this year and the organisation expected the amount it had paid out to rise to \u00a31.15bn by the end of March 2026. Sir Alan Bates, the central figure leading the drive for justice for hundreds of branch owner-operators and the subject of the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office, has said he will once again consider taking legal action if all claims are not resolved by March next year. The inquiry was shown documents on Monday from a Post Office board meeting in March this year that said the organisation had received 1,146 late applications to its redress schemes, with 697 coming after the broadcast of the damning drama in January that brought the plight of owner-operators to national attention. The Post Office officially stopped taking applications for its schemes in late November 2020. However, it moved to continue taking further applications from the end of 2022. Recaldin added that the Post Office had \u201ctentatively agreed\u201d a date to close one of its compensation schemes with government just before the ITV drama broad because the number of new applicants had dwindled to \u201ca handful a week\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful for the TV drama to have raised the issue [and prompted more applications],\u201d said Recaldin. \u201cThe peak in activity is absolutely the result of the ITV drama.\u201d He added that a date of March 2025 has been discussed with government to end taking applications for the Horizon shortfall scheme. Recaldin provided statistics in his written evidence that showed that a \u201cstandard\u201d claim took an average of 445 working days until compensation was delivered, although this had decreased to 302 working days in 2024. \u201cThis process takes too long, full stop,\u201d said Recaldin. \u201cIt does take too long but there is a process that has to be gone through.

Last week, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said in her debut budget that the government had set aside \u00a31.8bn to cover all claims.

They organised midnight meetings to accommodate their long working hours before securing union recognition.</p> <p>Steve North, the Unison president, said the situation faced by some care workers in the UK brought to mind the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/apr/25/kafala-labour-system-gulf-women-talk-about-life-as-a-domestic-worker-in-the-gulf\">\u201cKafala\u201d</a> system in parts of the Middle East. \u201cYou are completely owned by the company you work for, they control your destiny and that of your family, and if you don\u2019t do as you\u2019re told you risk deportation, so you do what you\u2019re told,\u201d he said.</p>    <p>Idris Kauji, 44, of Preston, an Indian care worker who helped shape the charter, told the Guardian the precariousness faced by employees on sponsored visas was the \u201cbiggest issue in adult social care\u201d.</p> <p>Matthew Dickinson, a local organiser for Unison who helped care workers from overseas in Salford, said workers were being \u201cduped, paying in some cases \u00a325k\u201d to recruiters before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/02/he-didnt-have-a-contract-for-me-the-indian-careworkers-who-paid-agents-to-work-in-britain\">arriving to find there was no work</a> for them, or they were made to work unpaid for long periods.</p> <p>While the process began in Greater Manchester, the charter has been shaped by care workers from across the UK, such as Lorato, 38, who came to south-west England on a sponsored visa from Botswana in 2022 to work with disabled adults. She was promised her own accommodation by an employer, but found herself sharing a room with another woman in a two-bedroom flat accommodating seven people.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t feel safe,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to fight for my salary, and then my employer was raided by immigration. Only now do I feel like I\u2019ve reached England, because my new job is properly paid.\u201d</p> <p>Salford\u2019s elected mayor, Paul Dennett, said it was an honour to be the first signatory to a charter that was a \u201cthorough step\u201d towards tackling examples of persecution and victimisation that care workers from overseas were \u201cexperiencing far too frequently\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cI hope many other local authorities across the country, especially Labour-controlled ones who have a historic responsibility to work hand in hand with trade unions, commit to [it] just as we have, and begin the fightback against the exploitative conditions in this sector, because ultimately, better conditions for care workers mean better standards of care for residents.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Care workers from countries such as India, Nigeria and the Philippines who faced losing their immigration status in the UK if they left their employers have been promised new protections by a landmark, grassroots deal. The migrant care workers charter is an agreement designed by care workers and the trade union Unison to prevent the exploitation of people on sponsored visas \u2013 and Salford council is the first in the country to sign up to it. The immigration status of people on post-Brexit sponsored health and care worker visas and skilled worker visas rests on them having a licensed employer. If they lose their job, the Home Office can cancel their visa, giving them 60 days to find a new sponsoring employer, apply for a different visa, or leave the country. Union organisers say this means care workers who have sold everything to come to the UK, often to work with people with dementia or complex needs, are vulnerable to exploitation by under-scrutinised employers. The charter includes a commitment that signatories, such as Salford council, will identify or act as an \u2018\u2018employer of last resort\u201d for care workers who have been victimised, or whose migration status is jeopardised after losing a job through no fault of their own, helping them to stay in the UK. Signatories also commit to creating an \u201cethical recruiter list\u201d to stop rogue employers getting public money. It comes after discoveries made over the last year by union officials in Greater Manchester. In one case, Nigerian workers at a care home in Salford faced losing their status in the UK because the home was closing and its site being sold for development, before Unison helped them find new jobs and secure unpaid wages. The union has also been working with Nigerian care workers employed by agencies whose licences were withdrawn by the Home Office. Officials helped dozens of Indian care workers who had raised concerns about underpayment and conditions, and felt their immigration status was being used to threaten them, which their employers deny. They organised midnight meetings to accommodate their long working hours before securing union recognition. Steve North, the Unison president, said the situation faced by some care workers in the UK brought to mind the \u201cKafala\u201d system in parts of the Middle East. \u201cYou are completely owned by the company you work for, they control your destiny and that of your family, and if you don\u2019t do as you\u2019re told you risk deportation, so you do what you\u2019re told,\u201d he said. Idris Kauji, 44, of Preston, an Indian care worker who helped shape the charter, told the Guardian the precariousness faced by employees on sponsored visas was the \u201cbiggest issue in adult social care\u201d. Matthew Dickinson, a local organiser for Unison who helped care workers from overseas in Salford, said workers were being \u201cduped, paying in some cases \u00a325k\u201d to recruiters before arriving to find there was no work for them, or they were made to work unpaid for long periods. While the process began in Greater Manchester, the charter has been shaped by care workers from across the UK, such as Lorato, 38, who came to south-west England on a sponsored visa from Botswana in 2022 to work with disabled adults. She was promised her own accommodation by an employer, but found herself sharing a room with another woman in a two-bedroom flat accommodating seven people. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel safe,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to fight for my salary, and then my employer was raided by immigration. Only now do I feel like I\u2019ve reached England, because my new job is properly paid.\u201d Salford\u2019s elected mayor, Paul Dennett, said it was an honour to be the first signatory to a charter that was a \u201cthorough step\u201d towards tackling examples of persecution and victimisation that care workers from overseas were \u201cexperiencing far too frequently\u201d. He added: \u201cI hope many other local authorities across the country, especially Labour-controlled ones who have a historic responsibility to work hand in hand with trade unions, commit to [it] just as we have, and begin the fightback against the exploitative conditions in this sector, because ultimately, better conditions for care workers mean better standards of care for residents.\u201d",

In 2020, 26,952 overseas voters from Pennsylvania successfully returned ballots that were counted. \u201cThe proper course of action for any county receiving mass challenges to these federally qualified \u2018overseas voters\u2019 is to summarily reject the challenges as both procedurally and substantively deficient,\u201d lawyers for the ACLU wrote in a letter to all 67 counties in the state. \u201cCounties should formally dismiss or deny the challenges as quickly as possible to minimize any delay or disruption to the canvassing process,\u201d lawyers for the ACLU wrote in a letter to all 67 counties in the state. So far officials in Bucks, Lancaster, Lehigh, York, Cumberland, Dauphin, Beaver, Centre, and Lycoming county have all received challenges, said Andy Hoover, an ACLU spokesman. The person who filed Larsons\u2019 challenge was Karen DiSalvo, a lawyer with a group called the Election Research Institute. DiSalvo recently lost a federal lawsuit challenging the eligibility of overseas voters that a federal judge said was based on \u201cphantom fears of foreign malfeasance\u201d. The Election Research Institute is led by Heather Honey, a prominent activist who has spread false claims about elections. Judges have dismissed similar challenges to overseas voters in North Carolina and Michigan. Pennsylvania allows voters to challenge the mail-in ballot of other voters. It is not clear how the Pennsylvania counties will handle the challenges. Even if they are dismissed, they underscore how Donald Trump and allies are already seeding doubt about the election. The ex-president falsely suggested in September that votes from overseas voters are fraudulent. Recent polls show Pennsylvania is essentially tied, and its 19 electoral votes are being closely fought over by both campaigns. Since the race is so close, both campaigns are fiercely fighting over rules that could affect whether certain mail-in votes count. The Pennsylvania supreme court ruled last week that voters who forget to write the date on their ballots will not have their votes counted. Both the state supreme court and the US supreme court also recently ruled that voters who forget to place their ballot in a protective secrecy sleeve can cast a provisional vote on election day. In both cases, Republicans sought to block the votes from being counted over technical deficiencies. Read more of the Guardian\u2019s 2024 US election coverage: When do polls close?

As the Guardian has outlined through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/the-stakes\">the Stakes project</a>, Trump\u2019s plans include extending tax cuts, rolling back landmark laws signed by Joe Biden and advancing a rightwing cultural agenda.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/nov/02/presidential-polls-latest-donald-trump-kamala-harris-election\">2024 US presidential polls tracker: Trump v Harris latest national averages</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of Republicans\u2019 most oft-repeated campaign promises is that they will extend the tax cuts Trump signed into law in 2017, many of which are set to expire at the end of 2025. An <a href=\"https://itep.org/extending-temporary-provisions-of-the-2017-trump-tax-law-national-and-state-by-state-estimates/\">analysis</a> from the non-partisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that making the tax cuts permanent would cost $288.5bn in 2026 alone and disproportionately benefit the highest-income households. The highest-income 20% of Americans would receive nearly two-thirds of that tax benefit, compared with just 1% for the lowest-income 20% of Americans.</p> <p>Perhaps the most haunting possibility for Democrats is that Republicans would use their governing trifecta in Washington to enact a nationwide abortion ban. Trump has <a href=\"https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1841295548109955091\">said</a> he would veto such a policy, but his repeated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/aug/30/election-trump-harris-abortion-updates?page=with:block-66d23bf48f0871b94295c101#block-66d23bf48f0871b94295c101\">flip-flopping</a> on the issue has raised questions about that claim. Research has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/09/state-abortion-bans-doctor-care-pregnancy\">shown</a> that existing abortion bans have forced doctors to provide substandard medical care, and they have been blamed for the deaths of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/30/texas-woman-death-abortion-ban-miscarriage\">at least</a> <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/nevaeh-crain-death-texas-abortion-ban-emtala\">four</a> women: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/30/texas-woman-death-abortion-ban-miscarriage\">Josseli Barnica</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/teen-dies-abortion-ban-texas-neveah-crain\">Nevaeh Crain</a>, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/candi-miller-abortion-ban-death-georgia\">Candi Miller</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/17/harris-trump-georgia-abortion-death-amber-nicole-thurman\">Amber Thurman</a>.</p> <p>With majorities in both chambers, Republicans could also allocate vast resources to assist Trump\u2019s plan to deport millions of undocumented migrants, which has become a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/oct/31/election-trump-immigration-policies\">central plank</a> of his re-election platform. While US courts have affirmed that presidents have much leeway when it comes to setting immigration policies, Trump will need Congress to appropriate extensive funds to carry out such a massive deportation operation.</p> <p>\u201cThe United States is now an occupied country,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/oct/31/election-trump-immigration-policies\">said</a> at a recent rally in Atlanta. \u201cBut on November 5, 2024, that will be liberation day in America.\u201d</p> <p>In addition to advancing Trump\u2019s agenda, Republicans would almost certainly be looking to unravel key portions of Biden\u2019s legacy, including the Inflation Reduction Act. The IRA marked the country\u2019s most significant response yet to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-crisis\">climate crisis</a> and has spurred significant energy-related investments in many districts, prompting some Republicans to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4885124-republicans-inflation-reduction-act-energy-tax-credits/\">suggest</a> that Congress should preserve some of the law\u2019s provisions while repealing others.</p> <p>That quandary reflects a potential problem for Republicans if they win full control of Congress: what will they do with the Affordable Care Act (ACA)? When Republicans last held a governing trifecta, during Trump\u2019s first two years in office, they tried and failed to repeal and replace the ACA.

      "bodyText": "As many anxious US election watchers constantly refresh the forecast from 538 in the final days before polls close, their attention tends to focus on the presidential race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, but the polling website\u2019s forecasts of the battle for House and the Senate paint an even more worrying picture for Democrats. As of Saturday evening, 538 gives Trump a 50% chance of winning the presidential race, while Republicans have a comfortable 90% chance of regaining control of the Senate and a narrower 52% chance of maintaining their House majority. Those numbers reflect a reality that is chilling to left-leaning Americans: Republicans have a decent shot at winning not just the White House but full control of Congress. Even without majorities in both chambers of Congress, Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential race would give him significant control over US foreign policy and the makeup of the federal government, both of which he is seeking to overhaul. But a Republican trifecta in Washington would give Trump much more sweeping power to implement his legislative agenda. As the Guardian has outlined through the Stakes project, Trump\u2019s plans include extending tax cuts, rolling back landmark laws signed by Joe Biden and advancing a rightwing cultural agenda. One of Republicans\u2019 most oft-repeated campaign promises is that they will extend the tax cuts Trump signed into law in 2017, many of which are set to expire at the end of 2025. An analysis from the non-partisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that making the tax cuts permanent would cost $288.5bn in 2026 alone and disproportionately benefit the highest-income households. The highest-income 20% of Americans would receive nearly two-thirds of that tax benefit, compared with just 1% for the lowest-income 20% of Americans. Perhaps the most haunting possibility for Democrats is that Republicans would use their governing trifecta in Washington to enact a nationwide abortion ban. Trump has said he would veto such a policy, but his repeated flip-flopping on the issue has raised questions about that claim. Research has shown that existing abortion bans have forced doctors to provide substandard medical care, and they have been blamed for the deaths of at least four women: Josseli Barnica, Nevaeh Crain, Candi Miller and Amber Thurman. With majorities in both chambers, Republicans could also allocate vast resources to assist Trump\u2019s plan to deport millions of undocumented migrants, which has become a central plank of his re-election platform. While US courts have affirmed that presidents have much leeway when it comes to setting immigration policies, Trump will need Congress to appropriate extensive funds to carry out such a massive deportation operation. \u201cThe United States is now an occupied country,\u201d Trump said at a recent rally in Atlanta. \u201cBut on November 5, 2024, that will be liberation day in America.\u201d In addition to advancing Trump\u2019s agenda, Republicans would almost certainly be looking to unravel key portions of Biden\u2019s legacy, including the Inflation Reduction Act. The IRA marked the country\u2019s most significant response yet to the climate crisis and has spurred significant energy-related investments in many districts, prompting some Republicans to suggest that Congress should preserve some of the law\u2019s provisions while repealing others. That quandary reflects a potential problem for Republicans if they win full control of Congress: what will they do with the Affordable Care Act (ACA)? When Republicans last held a governing trifecta, during Trump\u2019s first two years in office, they tried and failed to repeal and replace the ACA. The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, recently suggested that there would be \u201cno Obamacare\u201d if his party wins big on Tuesday, according to a video published by NBC News. But he seemed to caveat that statement by telling supporters: \u201cThe ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\u201d In recent years, both parties have experienced the pains of governing with narrow congressional majorities, and election experts widely expect the battle for the House and Senate to be especially close this year. During Biden\u2019s first two years in office, his legislative proposals were repeatedly blocked in the Senate despite Democrats holding a majority because of the concerns of two centrist members of their caucus, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. When Republicans held a 52-48 majority in the Senate in 2017, they still failed to repeal and replace the ACA because three members of their conference blocked the proposal. Two of those members \u2013 Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2013 are still in the Senate today and may be resistant to various components of Trump\u2019s agenda, particularly a potential abortion ban. Despite the potential challenges of narrow majorities, Trump has made clear at every turn that he will use his presidential power to its maximum effect if he wins on Tuesday. \u201cWith your vote this November, we\u2019re going to fire Kamala and we are going to save America,\u201d Trump said at his recent rally in State College, Pennsylvania. \u201cWe will never ever back down, and we will never surrender.\u201d The voters will have the final say on Tuesday to determine just how much power Trump and his party will have come January.

The boy, his parents and two primary-school aged siblings were held overnight in Singapore last month, leading the family to speak out about their treatment at the hands of Australian authorities. The boy, now aged 17, was held in a room with more than a dozen other detainees, one of whom asked him to \u201ccome under the blanket with me\u201d, his father said. In their first public comments since their son was charged in 2021, the Melbourne family, who cannot be identified, said they had encouraged their son to plan the overseas trip to Singapore and Malaysia as a way of overcoming the trauma of his case. But the trip resulted in further anguish when the boy was prevented from entering Singapore and the family were detained at the airport before, being forced on a plane back to Australia the day after leaving for their 10-day trip. This was despite the boy, given the pseudonym Thomas Carrick by the Victorian children\u2019s court, being given his passport back in November last year and the family saying they were told there was no restriction on his travel. \u201c[It] was a part of his rehabilitation, like for us it was something that could \u2026 cheer him up, so that he can feel important and have a holiday,\u201d his mother said.

The family are Australian citizens. \u201cIt is hard to believe that the government has made things worse for this family, but they did by failing to warn them that countries like Singapore would likely use the AFP investigation to detain them,\u201d Shoebridge said, adding: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they just do the decent human thing and say to this family that if they travel to Singapore they may well face detention and this kind of humiliation?\u201d Shoebridge, who has met with the family after they returned to Melbourne, said authorities must come clean on what alerts had been placed on Thomas\u2019s passport and why. \u201cOne question the AFP needs to answer immediately is did they provide information to the Singaporean authorities that led to the detention and the retraumatising of this family?\u201d The Department of Foreign Affairs, the AFP and the Department of Home Affairs were contacted for comment. An AFP spokesperson said: \u201cThis is a matter for Singaporean authorities.\u201d",

Those are the results of the latest Guardian Essential poll of 1,131 voters, which could spell trouble for Anthony Albanese, given scrutiny on his receipt of gifts including Taylor Swift concert tickets and Qantas flight upgrades, which were properly declared. Respondents to the poll were told that \u201cmany Australian politicians get access to many special events and benefits\u201d and asked if they should accept or reject the perks. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email A majority disapproved of politicians attending major concerts (63% to 23%), receiving complimentary flight upgrades (61% to 26%), attending major sporting events such as the Melbourne Cup and grand finals (59% to 27%) and accessing VIP airline lounges (58% to 28%). About one in seven respondents (14%) were \u201cunsure\u201d whether politicians should accept these. Labor voters were slightly more likely to back gifts for politicians, with about a third (32%) supporting taking flight upgrades compared with 27% of Coalition supporters. Supporters of independents and minor parties were particularly opposed, with just 18% agreeing politicians should take flight upgrades. Parliamentarians of all political stripes receive free tickets, and the Qantas controversy also sent the Coalition\u2019s transport spokesperson, Bridget McKenzie, rushing to review her own disclosures on flight upgrades. But the issue of flights has caused most trouble for the prime minister, given it took six days for him to deny the allegation in Joe Aston\u2019s book that he had personally contacted the former Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce for upgrades. On Monday the independent MP Allegra Spender called to \u201cend the upgrades\u201d, revealing she had written to Qantas and Virgin asking them \u201cnot to give free upgrades to any MPs or senators\u201d and calling on parliamentarians not to accept them. \u201cSpecial treatment of politicians by Qantas and Virgin has undermined public trust in government and effective competition in the aviation industry,\u201d she said. \u201cAll sides of politics enjoy the perks and both major parties have failed to bring increased competition and lower fares to Australian travellers. \u201cBoth the Labor and the Liberal parties have blocked greater competition by Qatar Airways.\u201d Spender revealed she is cancelling her Qantas and Virgin VIP lounge memberships, joining a select few who say no to the perk. In October Guardian Australia revealed that at least 90% of federal politicians have declared taking up invitations to join the exclusive Qantas Chairman\u2019s Lounge and dozens also received flight upgrades, expensive gifts or hospitality from the national carrier. While most Australians oppose politicians attending the Melbourne Cup, respondents reported their own interest in the event has recovered despite long-term decline. Some 16% of respondents reported a \u201chigh interest\u201d in the race that stops a nation, up five points since October 2023, and 30% reported a \u201cmoderate interest\u201d, up six. A majority reported low (26%) or no (26%) interest. About half (48%) said the event \u201cpromotes unhealthy gambling behaviour\u201d while 36% said it \u201cnormalises animal cruelty\u201d. Nevertheless, a majority (68%) of respondents said the Melbourne Cup was a \u201cunique\u201d part of Australia\u2019s national identity.",

It is a choice about whether we have a country rooted in freedom for every American. Or one ruled by chaos and division.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike Hillary Clinton, who made gender a central part of her 2016 run for office, at a time of historic polarization Harris chose to focus on issues over identity. That is also how she chose to run her unusually short campaign of 13 weeks after an ageing Biden finally passed her the mantle on 21 July.</p> <p>Laurie Pohutsky, a Democratic state representative in Michigan, decided to run in 2018 after witnessing Trump\u2019s misogynistic campaign against Hillary Clinton in 2016. Since then, she has introduced two key pieces of state legislation that lifted restrictions on abortion. In a phone interview from the swing state governed by the Democrat Gretchen Whitmer, she said:<strong> </strong>\u201cYou know, we weren\u2019t elected because we were women. And I think that when we frame it that way, we do a disservice to ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>She said she agreed with Harris\u2019s choice not to focus on gender: \u201cWhile it\u2019s historic, it\u2019s not what would make her a good president.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re long overdue for a female president,\u201d she added. \u201cBut that\u2019s not why I think people are voting for her.

This is the reason, Stratton tells me, that he retired from reviewing in 2023. \u201cI\u2019m not completely blind,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I can\u2019t see well enough to review films any more. Everything is a little out of focus. I\u2019m not in the best of health at the moment. When you get to my age, I guess you expect these things. I was pleased that I managed to finish the book.\u201d Trying to cover every locally produced feature made between 1990 and 2020, Australia at the Movies is a work of archaeology as much as criticism. It compiles about 650 reviews, encompassing the big hitters \u2013 think Muriel\u2019s Wedding, Strictly Ballroom, Mad Max: Fury Road \u2013 as well as championing smaller productions that barely saw the light of day or fizzled at the box office. These include, among many others, Partho Sen-Gupta\u2019s portrait of a Palestinian Australian slam poet, Slam (\u201cconvincing and enthralling\u201d), and Serhat Caradee\u2019s dialogue-heavy Sydney-set drama A Lion Returns (\u201chermetic and potent\u201d). This is Stratton\u2019s sixth book, including two others on Australian cinema: 1980\u2019s The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival, and 1990\u2019s The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry.

      "body": "<p>A congressional candidate in Texas has been actively campaigning at events in churches that feature her campaign banners, potentially in violation of federal regulations that prohibit what the law calls \u201c<a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-07-41.pdf\">political campaign intervention</a>\u201d, as a condition of tax exemptions for non-profit religious organizations.</p> <p>Republican candidate Mayra Flores, who was endorsed in the primary by Donald Trump, is running in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2024\">this election</a> to unseat the Democratic representative Vicente Gonzalez in south Texas\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/house-election-swing-districts.html\">competitive</a> 34th district.</p> <p>In recent months, Flores has appeared at events held at churches that are promoted as revivals, prayer events and luncheons but appear at times to have a distinctly partisan atmosphere.</p>    <p>Although political candidates regularly show up at churches during an election cycle and even speak from the pulpit, the visits and addresses are usually carefully calibrated. Federal tax law warns of violations if an individual is publicly recognized as a candidate for an upcoming election by the organization in its communications regarding their attendance at an event or the organization does not maintain a non-partisan atmosphere.</p> <p>Tax-exempt organizations are allowed to take stances on policy issues that divide candidates, but violations can arise if an organization\u2019s messaging at the event favors or opposes a candidate for election \u2013 even without explicitly saying so.</p> <p>In early August, Flores attended a community prayer event held for her at the Collective Church RGV in Harlingen, in the Rio Grande valley on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-mexico-border\">US-Mexico border</a>. Large campaign banners reading \u201cMayra Flores for Congress\u201d with an image of the candidate and \u201cGod Family Country\u201d written below were displayed on stage.</p> <p>The church and the candidate posted photos from the event on their social media pages showing congregants and the pastors, Manny and Erica Espinoza, praying for Flores on stage.</p> <p>The church\u2019s Facebook page on 7 August includes <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=904883935011929&amp;set=pcb.904884008345255\">images</a> from the event and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheCollectiveChurchRGV/posts/pfbid04MjhuqtNeNfQefJUX3kU3Vp992C6ZirLR4HxQyPMX8Zbxke3mKvZibMptRFkkfCVl\">the post</a>: \u201cEpic event last night with Mayra Flores! Thank you to all who came out to support her and her campaign. Help us continue to pray for her, her family and the future of our nation. Go out and vote!!!\u201d</p> <p>John Darcy, an academic and tax expert based in Edinburg, Texas, said: \u201cThey have to have an open invitation to all of the major candidates and if the church hasn\u2019t invited all of them, then that\u2019s a serious violation \u2013 plus, the way they conduct a meeting if they engaged in any activity during the meeting that suggested anything more than they just introduced the candidate.\u201d</p> <p>The Collective Church RGV did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>In another instance in mid-October at Livingway Family church in Brownsville, Flores made an appearance at an event called Revival on the Border, organized under the umbrella of the 501(c)3 charitable organization Bienvenido, which describes itself as a non-partisan organization dedicated to the advancement of the Hispanic community and has <a href=\"https://bienvenido.us/news/bienvenidos-empresarios-endorses-president-trumps-vision-for-americas-economic-future\">endorsed Trump</a>. </p>    <p>At the church, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/flashpoint-trump-republican-christian-tv-show-rcna150303\">a national pro-Trump TV show</a>, FlashPoint, held a live taping with the conservative host Gene Bailey and guest speaker Abraham Enriquez, founder of Bienvenido, who made pro-Trump and pro-Republican comments to the audience. </p> <p>Flores also spoke during the live event. Part of her platform is intertwining Christianity with American government and she made statements such as: \u201cWhen we see religious leaders getting involved in politics, it gives me hope for our country.\u201d</p> <p>The Livingway church did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>Flores also made an appearance at Cross church in San Benito, Texas, in late September at a church luncheon. On her campaign\u2019s social media, Flores posted photos with attendees and herself next to pastors Jaime and Rose Mary Loya, with a backdrop displaying the message \u201cRe-Elect Congresswoman Mayra Flores\u201d.</p> <p>Flores <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/15/mayra-flores-texas-house-republican-special-election\">had won</a> the seat in a special election in June 2022, turning the district red for the first time, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-midterm-elections-2022\">lost it again</a> to Gonzalez in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-midterm-elections-2022\">that November\u2019s midterms</a>.</p>    <p>In her post about the Cross church event, she thanked the church and referenced a discussion about \u201cthe importance of electing representatives that have our biblical values\u201d.</p> <p>Darcy said of such events: \u201cIt suggests an issue that the church may be exhibiting bias having only one candidate at a church-sponsored event on the property of a 501(c)3 without providing similar license to the opposing candidate.\u201d</p> <p>The Cross church did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>Gonzalez\u2019s campaign said their candidate was not invited to any of the events mentioned.</p> <p>Federal tax-code further states that a candidate appearing or speaking would not, on its face, violate the ban on what the tax code calls a political campaign intervention, a legal definition related to but narrower than political bias.</p> <p>However, if the candidate or any representative mentions their candidacy or if any campaigning activity occurs, there may be a potential violation, Darcy said.</p> <p>Gonzalez said: \u201cI think that\u2019s something that churches need to be thoughtful and careful with. Let\u2019s keep the separation of church and state.\u201d</p> <p>He added that in his view, churchgoers attend services to hear the word of God and not to hear political rhetoric or support for one candidate over another.</p> <p>Flores goes to many campaign events accompanied by a local pastor, Luis Cabrera, who sometimes prays for her at the beginning of a rally or event.</p>    <p>Cabrera founded a movement with a name that uses a twist on Trump\u2019s campaign slogan Make America Great Again (Maga): \u201cMake America Godly Again\u201d, which he wears on T-shirts and hats. The movement discusses the need to take a biblical stance on current issues and discusses what it terms godly citizenship.</p> <p>Gonzalez also said he had received complaints from some constituents who attend the Collective church RGV regarding Flores campaigning at their church.</p> <p>When approached for comment, Flores\u2019s campaign directed the Guardian to the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), a Washington body that works to elect Republicans to the House of Representatives. The committee sent back information showing Gonzalez attending church events in 2016, during his first campaign for office,with pictures where he can be seen meeting and greeting people at such events while wearing a badge that appears to say Vicente Gonzalez for US Congress.</p> <p>Gonzalez said: \u201cThere is a difference between running your campaign out of an actual church and attending community events as a candidate. They\u2019re saying this because they can\u2019t defend what she\u2019s done.\u201d</p>    <p>Flores later sent a statement, saying: \u201cWhy a British newspaper is trying to attack the South Texas faith community is beyond me. While our local churches and faith groups come under attack, I pray our community will hold steadfast in our fight for God, family, and country.\u201d</p> <p>One member of a Presbyterian church in Harlingen, and a Democrat, Joyce Hamilton said she was disturbed by the merger of politics and religion in Flores\u2019s campaign, going against what she sees as the \u201csacred\u201d separation of church and state on which the USA was founded.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I have been seeing that really shakes me to my core is candidates running on their religion as if that\u2019s what gives them more than just the moral right to be elected, but sort of a coercion of the conscience of American voters,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She added: \u201cIt\u2019s problematic to me as a person who follows Christianity and has my own spiritual search \u2026 It feels offensive to me for someone to claim that they represent God, family and country. I wouldn\u2019t be pretending that I\u2019m the biblical candidate.\u201d</p> <p>Hamilton was also disturbed by the churches appearing to veer into the territory of campaigning for Flores.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes me feel very uncomfortable \u2026 mixing politics and church, and possibly pressuring people in the sense of making them feel that \u2018I must vote that way as a Christian\u2019 doesn\u2019t fit with my views,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Jan Demro, a member of a Lutheran church in Harlingen, also strongly endorsed the separation of church and state at the root of the United States\u2019 founding, and was left with strong feelings regarding Flores campaign signs at church events.</p> <p>\u201cI am totally opposed to the idea that political campaigning belongs in a church. It both angers and it saddens me because I feel like she\u2019s taking advantage of the people that she\u2019s preaching to. What she is preaching on is more Christian nationalism than Christianity.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Read more of the Guardian\u2019s 2024 US election coverage:</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/when-do-polls-close-election-day\">When do polls close</a>?</p></li> <li><p>How the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/election-electoral-college-votes-explained\">electoral college works</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/26/election-abortion-ballot-measures-states\">Where is abortion on the ballot?</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/18/senate-races-elections-to-watch\">Senate</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/11/house-races-2024-elections-explainer\">House</a> races to watch</p></li> <li><p>Lessons from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/26/swing-state-polls-pennsylvania-michigan-georgia-arizona-wisconsin-nevada-north-carolina\">key swing states</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/03/election-trump-harris-policies-issues\">Trump v Harris on key issues</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/nov/03/if-trump-wins-the-election-these-11-issues-will-be-under-threat\">What\u2019s at stake</a> in this election</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/nov/03/us-presidential-election-trump-harris\">What to know about the US election</a></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "A congressional candidate in Texas has been actively campaigning at events in churches that feature her campaign banners, potentially in violation of federal regulations that prohibit what the law calls \u201cpolitical campaign intervention\u201d, as a condition of tax exemptions for non-profit religious organizations. Republican candidate Mayra Flores, who was endorsed in the primary by Donald Trump, is running in this election to unseat the Democratic representative Vicente Gonzalez in south Texas\u2019s competitive 34th district. In recent months, Flores has appeared at events held at churches that are promoted as revivals, prayer events and luncheons but appear at times to have a distinctly partisan atmosphere. Although political candidates regularly show up at churches during an election cycle and even speak from the pulpit, the visits and addresses are usually carefully calibrated. Federal tax law warns of violations if an individual is publicly recognized as a candidate for an upcoming election by the organization in its communications regarding their attendance at an event or the organization does not maintain a non-partisan atmosphere. Tax-exempt organizations are allowed to take stances on policy issues that divide candidates, but violations can arise if an organization\u2019s messaging at the event favors or opposes a candidate for election \u2013 even without explicitly saying so. In early August, Flores attended a community prayer event held for her at the Collective Church RGV in Harlingen, in the Rio Grande valley on the US-Mexico border. Large campaign banners reading \u201cMayra Flores for Congress\u201d with an image of the candidate and \u201cGod Family Country\u201d written below were displayed on stage. The church and the candidate posted photos from the event on their social media pages showing congregants and the pastors, Manny and Erica Espinoza, praying for Flores on stage. The church\u2019s Facebook page on 7 August includes images from the event and the post: \u201cEpic event last night with Mayra Flores! Thank you to all who came out to support her and her campaign. Help us continue to pray for her, her family and the future of our nation. Go out and vote!!!\u201d John Darcy, an academic and tax expert based in Edinburg, Texas, said: \u201cThey have to have an open invitation to all of the major candidates and if the church hasn\u2019t invited all of them, then that\u2019s a serious violation \u2013 plus, the way they conduct a meeting if they engaged in any activity during the meeting that suggested anything more than they just introduced the candidate.\u201d The Collective Church RGV did not respond to a request for comment. In another instance in mid-October at Livingway Family church in Brownsville, Flores made an appearance at an event called Revival on the Border, organized under the umbrella of the 501(c)3 charitable organization Bienvenido, which describes itself as a non-partisan organization dedicated to the advancement of the Hispanic community and has endorsed Trump. At the church, a national pro-Trump TV show, FlashPoint, held a live taping with the conservative host Gene Bailey and guest speaker Abraham Enriquez, founder of Bienvenido, who made pro-Trump and pro-Republican comments to the audience. Flores also spoke during the live event. Part of her platform is intertwining Christianity with American government and she made statements such as: \u201cWhen we see religious leaders getting involved in politics, it gives me hope for our country.\u201d The Livingway church did not respond to a request for comment. Flores also made an appearance at Cross church in San Benito, Texas, in late September at a church luncheon. On her campaign\u2019s social media, Flores posted photos with attendees and herself next to pastors Jaime and Rose Mary Loya, with a backdrop displaying the message \u201cRe-Elect Congresswoman Mayra Flores\u201d. Flores had won the seat in a special election in June 2022, turning the district red for the first time, but lost it again to Gonzalez in that November\u2019s midterms. In her post about the Cross church event, she thanked the church and referenced a discussion about \u201cthe importance of electing representatives that have our biblical values\u201d. Darcy said of such events: \u201cIt suggests an issue that the church may be exhibiting bias having only one candidate at a church-sponsored event on the property of a 501(c)3 without providing similar license to the opposing candidate.\u201d The Cross church did not respond to a request for comment. Gonzalez\u2019s campaign said their candidate was not invited to any of the events mentioned. Federal tax-code further states that a candidate appearing or speaking would not, on its face, violate the ban on what the tax code calls a political campaign intervention, a legal definition related to but narrower than political bias. However, if the candidate or any representative mentions their candidacy or if any campaigning activity occurs, there may be a potential violation, Darcy said. Gonzalez said: \u201cI think that\u2019s something that churches need to be thoughtful and careful with. Let\u2019s keep the separation of church and state.\u201d He added that in his view, churchgoers attend services to hear the word of God and not to hear political rhetoric or support for one candidate over another. Flores goes to many campaign events accompanied by a local pastor, Luis Cabrera, who sometimes prays for her at the beginning of a rally or event. Cabrera founded a movement with a name that uses a twist on Trump\u2019s campaign slogan Make America Great Again (Maga): \u201cMake America Godly Again\u201d, which he wears on T-shirts and hats. The movement discusses the need to take a biblical stance on current issues and discusses what it terms godly citizenship. Gonzalez also said he had received complaints from some constituents who attend the Collective church RGV regarding Flores campaigning at their church. When approached for comment, Flores\u2019s campaign directed the Guardian to the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), a Washington body that works to elect Republicans to the House of Representatives. The committee sent back information showing Gonzalez attending church events in 2016, during his first campaign for office,with pictures where he can be seen meeting and greeting people at such events while wearing a badge that appears to say Vicente Gonzalez for US Congress. Gonzalez said: \u201cThere is a difference between running your campaign out of an actual church and attending community events as a candidate. They\u2019re saying this because they can\u2019t defend what she\u2019s done.\u201d Flores later sent a statement, saying: \u201cWhy a British newspaper is trying to attack the South Texas faith community is beyond me. While our local churches and faith groups come under attack, I pray our community will hold steadfast in our fight for God, family, and country.\u201d One member of a Presbyterian church in Harlingen, and a Democrat, Joyce Hamilton said she was disturbed by the merger of politics and religion in Flores\u2019s campaign, going against what she sees as the \u201csacred\u201d separation of church and state on which the USA was founded. \u201cWhat I have been seeing that really shakes me to my core is candidates running on their religion as if that\u2019s what gives them more than just the moral right to be elected, but sort of a coercion of the conscience of American voters,\u201d she said. She added: \u201cIt\u2019s problematic to me as a person who follows Christianity and has my own spiritual search \u2026 It feels offensive to me for someone to claim that they represent God, family and country. I wouldn\u2019t be pretending that I\u2019m the biblical candidate.\u201d Hamilton was also disturbed by the churches appearing to veer into the territory of campaigning for Flores. \u201cIt makes me feel very uncomfortable \u2026 mixing politics and church, and possibly pressuring people in the sense of making them feel that \u2018I must vote that way as a Christian\u2019 doesn\u2019t fit with my views,\u201d she said. Jan Demro, a member of a Lutheran church in Harlingen, also strongly endorsed the separation of church and state at the root of the United States\u2019 founding, and was left with strong feelings regarding Flores campaign signs at church events. \u201cI am totally opposed to the idea that political campaigning belongs in a church. It both angers and it saddens me because I feel like she\u2019s taking advantage of the people that she\u2019s preaching to. What she is preaching on is more Christian nationalism than Christianity.\u201d Read more of the Guardian\u2019s 2024 US election coverage: When do polls close?

In New South Wales Sussan Ley is facing an independent challenge from Michelle Milthorpe, who has to surmount a 16% margin to win. The 126,000 sq km seat of Farrer runs from Albury along the Victorian border to South Australia. Milthorpe previously campaigned to change the way child sexual abuse victims were treated in the NSW courts, in conjunction with Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp \u2013 an organisation leery of teal politics. In Queensland the 2022 independent candidate Suzie Holt is running again in Groom, a seat based in Toowoomba and held by the Liberal National party\u2019s Garth Hamilton on a margin of just under 7%. As I have written before, Holt has never stopped campaigning and so will be worth watching in the coming election. As the world gets to know the seven swing states of the US, whatever the result, the enduring political lesson may not be lost on Australian voters. After all, we have been told ad infinitum those swing states are where the real election will be fought. Those voters hold the key to the American election outcome and you can see it as the presidential candidates throw their time and resources at those places. In regional Australia, political engagement may hold the key to the 2025 federal election.

The brass fanfares carry the song and Jones stuffs the rest, like a Hollywood film with budget to burn on extras, with everything from camp storytelling flourishes such as the wolf howls to deft jazz detailing.

He sniffed out gold in an unfairly flopped single by Chaz Jankel, a member of Ian Dury\u2019s Blockheads who had struck out for solo glory with an eight-minute funk-pop song inspired by the violent erotic infatuations explored in Nagisa Oshima\u2019s film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/28/realm-of-senses-review\">In the Realm of the Senses</a> \u2013 admittedly not the most obviously crowdpleasing fare. The madness of Jankel\u2019s spirited original is admittedly tamped down by Jones, but his snappy sophistication provides its own pleasures \u2013 and ensured it was, finally, a hit.</p> <h2>Helen Merrill \u2013 Don\u2019t Explain</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t16xMI29TPk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/t16xMI29TPk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Recorded just before Christmas in 1954, this song is like the first flakes of snow dotting a window pane: sparse, beautiful, melancholy and charged with wonder.

      "bodyText": "Michael Jackson \u2013 Thriller For all Quincy Jones\u2019s astonishing versatility, straddling the analogue warmth of big band jazz and the sleek production of the early-digital 80s, there is one work that towers over them all: Thriller, the biggest-selling album of all time. On its title track, Jones brings a half century of music to bear on its lavish, theatrical, yet still funky arrangement: it is like something from the music hall or vaudeville days, scaled up for the maximalist 80s. The brass fanfares carry the song and Jones stuffs the rest, like a Hollywood film with budget to burn on extras, with everything from camp storytelling flourishes such as the wolf howls to deft jazz detailing. Check that little organ flourish just before Jackson starts singing, or the freewheeling funk-guitar melody low in the mix in the chorus. Donna Summer \u2013 State of Independence A great music producer needs directorial vision \u2013 something that came naturally to Jones since his time as an orchestral conductor \u2013 as well as technological nous and an impresario\u2019s eye and ear for talent.

      "body": "<p>From the 1980s onwards, Quincy Jones, who has died aged 91, was best known for his production and arranging work with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/26/michael-jackson-obituary\">Michael Jackson</a>, not least because his efforts on Jackson\u2019s album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/17/michael-jackson-thriller-first-album-sell-30m-copies-us\">Thriller</a> helped make it one of the bestselling albums in pop history. But the superstar glare surrounding his work with Jackson tended to conceal the fact that there were many more layers to Jones\u2019s abilities.</p> <p>He worked with jazz stars such as Count Basie and Dizzy Gillespie, became a friend and collaborator of <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-frank-sinatra-1159412.html\">Frank Sinatra</a>, and developed a flourishing career as a composer of soundtracks for film and TV. He enjoyed success under his own name in styles ranging from big-band jazz and swing to pop, soul and funk. He became an influential music business executive, a successful entrepreneur in film and TV production and launched the music magazine VIBE.</p> <p>He was born in Chicago, the son of Quincy Jones Sr, a carpenter and semi-pro baseball player, and his wife, Sarah (nee Wells), a building manager. His parents divorced, Quincy Sr remarried, and the family moved to Bremerton, Washington, during the second world war, then to Seattle. Quincy Jr began playing the trumpet and singing in a gospel quartet at the age of 12, and when he met up with the teenaged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jun/12/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\">Ray Charles</a>, also based in the Seattle area, Charles encouraged him to take an interest in arranging. A course at the Berklee College of Music in Boston set Jones up for his first professional job, in 1951, with the bandleader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/sep/02/guardianobituaries.arts\">Lionel Hampton</a>.</p> <p>His experiences on the road with the Hampton band were an eye-opener. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t stay in white hotels, and to me, coming from Seattle, a lot of this stuff was like a slap in the face,\u201d he said. \u201cBack then, all the black bands had white bus drivers so they could eat, \u2019cos you couldn\u2019t go into white restaurants. Even in Philadelphia, they had segregated hotels.\u201d Jones left Hampton in 1953, having accompanied the band on a European tour and rubbed shoulders with a remarkable lineup of musicians including the&nbsp;trumpeters Clifford Brown and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/oct/07/guardianobituaries.johnfordham\">Art Farmer</a>.</p>    <p>He set about making a living writing arrangements for jazz luminaries including Basie and Tommy Dorsey. Although Jones put in a stint as musical director for Gillespie\u2019s ensemble in 1956, he was aware that the days of the big bands were numbered, and rock\u2019n\u2019roll was coming. \u201cIn a funny way, Lionel Hampton was one of the bands that was serious with a rock\u2019n\u2019roll sensibility, before we even knew what the word meant,\u201d Jones said.</p> <p>During 1957 and 1958, Jones based himself in France and Scandinavia. He continued to study composition \u2013 notably with <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20170308-the-greatest-music-teacher-who-ever-lived\">Nadia Boulanger</a>, mentor of Leonard Bernstein and Aaron Copland, among others \u2013 and took a job with Barclay Disques, the Paris-based subsidiary of Mercury Records. While in Europe he formed a star-studded big band of his own, and spent two years touring Europe and the US. He wrote material for Count Basie, and during the late 1950s and early 60s worked as an arranger and music director on recording sessions for vocalists including Billy Eckstine, Ella Fitzgerald, Dinah Washington and Sarah&nbsp;Vaughan.</p> <p>In 1964, Jones won his first Grammy award, for his arrangement of Basie\u2019s recording of the Don Gibson song<em><strong> </strong></em>I Can\u2019t Stop Loving You. He also produced four million-selling singles for Lesley Gore, including the US chart-topper and UK Top 10 hit It\u2019s My Party (1963). His hectic career was matched by an equally eventful private life. In his memoir Q: The Autobiography of Quincy Jones (2001), he described how at one point he was dating five women at the same time.</p> <p>His burgeoning profile was boosted by collaborations with Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/26/andy-williams\">Andy Williams</a>. Jones\u2019s association with Sinatra produced the albums It Might As Well Be Swing (1964) and Sinatra at the Sands (1966), both featuring Basie\u2019s band. Jones and Sinatra became close friends, Jones later writing that Sinatra was \u201chip, straight up and straight ahead, and above all, a monster musician\u201d.</p> <p>Jones\u2019s track record gained him entry into the lucrative fields of film and television, and he became the first black composer to find acceptance within Hollywood. Throughout the late 60s and 70s he was commissioned to write scores for more than 30 movies and hundreds of TV shows. Among his better-known film projects are In Cold Blood (1967), In the Heat of the Night (1967), The Italian Job (1969) and The Getaway (1972). The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zViIajZwH-s\">theme from Ironside</a> is his most instantly recognisable effort for the small screen, but his compositions for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez26QXBCwzU\">The Bill Cosby Show</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O20Sljxmy9M\">Sanford and Son</a> and his Emmy-winning work for the miniseries Roots proved enduringly popular.</p> <p>As the 70s wore on, Jones displayed his instinct for moving with prevailing musical trends by immersing himself in funk and disco music.

      "bodyText": "From the 1980s onwards, Quincy Jones, who has died aged 91, was best known for his production and arranging work with Michael Jackson, not least because his efforts on Jackson\u2019s album Thriller helped make it one of the bestselling albums in pop history. But the superstar glare surrounding his work with Jackson tended to conceal the fact that there were many more layers to Jones\u2019s abilities. He worked with jazz stars such as Count Basie and Dizzy Gillespie, became a friend and collaborator of Frank Sinatra, and developed a flourishing career as a composer of soundtracks for film and TV. He enjoyed success under his own name in styles ranging from big-band jazz and swing to pop, soul and funk. He became an influential music business executive, a successful entrepreneur in film and TV production and launched the music magazine VIBE. He was born in Chicago, the son of Quincy Jones Sr, a carpenter and semi-pro baseball player, and his wife, Sarah (nee Wells), a building manager. His parents divorced, Quincy Sr remarried, and the family moved to Bremerton, Washington, during the second world war, then to Seattle. Quincy Jr began playing the trumpet and singing in a gospel quartet at the age of 12, and when he met up with the teenaged Ray Charles, also based in the Seattle area, Charles encouraged him to take an interest in arranging. A course at the Berklee College of Music in Boston set Jones up for his first professional job, in 1951, with the bandleader Lionel Hampton. His experiences on the road with the Hampton band were an eye-opener. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t stay in white hotels, and to me, coming from Seattle, a lot of this stuff was like a slap in the face,\u201d he said. \u201cBack then, all the black bands had white bus drivers so they could eat, \u2019cos you couldn\u2019t go into white restaurants. Even in Philadelphia, they had segregated hotels.\u201d Jones left Hampton in 1953, having accompanied the band on a European tour and rubbed shoulders with a remarkable lineup of musicians including the trumpeters Clifford Brown and Art Farmer. He set about making a living writing arrangements for jazz luminaries including Basie and Tommy Dorsey. Although Jones put in a stint as musical director for Gillespie\u2019s ensemble in 1956, he was aware that the days of the big bands were numbered, and rock\u2019n\u2019roll was coming. \u201cIn a funny way, Lionel Hampton was one of the bands that was serious with a rock\u2019n\u2019roll sensibility, before we even knew what the word meant,\u201d Jones said. During 1957 and 1958, Jones based himself in France and Scandinavia. He continued to study composition \u2013 notably with Nadia Boulanger, mentor of Leonard Bernstein and Aaron Copland, among others \u2013 and took a job with Barclay Disques, the Paris-based subsidiary of Mercury Records. While in Europe he formed a star-studded big band of his own, and spent two years touring Europe and the US. He wrote material for Count Basie, and during the late 1950s and early 60s worked as an arranger and music director on recording sessions for vocalists including Billy Eckstine, Ella Fitzgerald, Dinah Washington and Sarah Vaughan. In 1964, Jones won his first Grammy award, for his arrangement of Basie\u2019s recording of the Don Gibson song I Can\u2019t Stop Loving You. He also produced four million-selling singles for Lesley Gore, including the US chart-topper and UK Top 10 hit It\u2019s My Party (1963). His hectic career was matched by an equally eventful private life. In his memoir Q: The Autobiography of Quincy Jones (2001), he described how at one point he was dating five women at the same time. His burgeoning profile was boosted by collaborations with Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr and Andy Williams. Jones\u2019s association with Sinatra produced the albums It Might As Well Be Swing (1964) and Sinatra at the Sands (1966), both featuring Basie\u2019s band. Jones and Sinatra became close friends, Jones later writing that Sinatra was \u201chip, straight up and straight ahead, and above all, a monster musician\u201d. Jones\u2019s track record gained him entry into the lucrative fields of film and television, and he became the first black composer to find acceptance within Hollywood. Throughout the late 60s and 70s he was commissioned to write scores for more than 30 movies and hundreds of TV shows. Among his better-known film projects are In Cold Blood (1967), In the Heat of the Night (1967), The Italian Job (1969) and The Getaway (1972). The theme from Ironside is his most instantly recognisable effort for the small screen, but his compositions for The Bill Cosby Show, Sanford and Son and his Emmy-winning work for the miniseries Roots proved enduringly popular. As the 70s wore on, Jones displayed his instinct for moving with prevailing musical trends by immersing himself in funk and disco music. His album Body Heat, from 1974, featured the Brothers Johnson as the rhythm section, and Jones subsequently produced bestselling albums by the Brothers Johnson themselves. Despite undergoing surgery to deal with twin brain aneurysms in 1974, Jones continued to work at a furious pace. He produced chart-busting albums for the disco queen Donna Summer and soul diva Aretha Franklin, and he found another musical soulmate in the guitarist George Benson. Their collaboration on Give Me the Night (1980) \u2013 the debut release on Jones\u2019s Qwest label \u2013 was another career benchmark, the album reaching No 3 on the US album chart while the title track was a No 4 single. Meanwhile Jones had hits under his own name. He had a US Top 30 success with Stuff Like That (1978), and in 1981 scored a Top 10 album with The Dude, which spun off the Top 30 hit Ai No Corrida (No 4 in the UK), and the Top 20 hits Just Once and One Hundred Ways, both featuring James Ingram. In 1998, the hit movie Austin Powers prompted a revival of Quincy\u2019s 1962 hip-shaker, Soul Bossa Nova; it was also used as a theme for the 1998 football World Cup in France. Jones first met Michael Jackson, then aged 12, at Davis Jr\u2019s house, but it was not until Jones was working on the soundtrack for the film The Wiz (1978), starring Jackson and Diana Ross, that he was invited to produce a Jackson solo album. This was the 20m-selling Off the Wall (1979). Their collaboration continued with Thriller (1982) and Bad (1987), the trio selling 100m copies between them. In between, Jones was also the natural choice to produce the 1985 charity single, We Are the World, co-written by Jackson and Lionel Richie and performed by the all-star USA For Africa to benefit Ethiopian famine victims. Jones was a pivotal figure in helping musicians take control of the business side of their work. Like most other musicians, he had grown accustomed in the early years of his career to having his royalties and copyrights appropriated by unscrupulous publishers or record labels. \u201cIf you write a song, the publishing is 50% of that,\u201d Jones explained. \u201cThey would say: \u2018I want 50% of your creation\u2019, so that means you get 25%. That was normal.\u201d He began to see the light when he took a job as A&amp;R man at Mercury Records in New York in 1961. Within two years, he was made a vice-president, making him the first high-level black executive of a major record label. \u201cI\u2019d lost so much money when I had my band [the Jones Boys] in Europe that I had to go with a record company. That\u2019s when I said: \u2018I\u2019d better pay attention to the other side, because it is a music business.\u2019\u201d After moving from Mercury to A&amp;M Records he launched Qwest, which became home to such varied artists as New Order, Milt Jackson, the Winans and Tevin Campbell. Qwest also did excellent business with the soundtracks to Malcolm X (1992) and the rap-generation movie Boyz N the Hood (1991). Growing into the role of entertainment mogul, Jones co-produced Steven Spielberg\u2019s film of The Color Purple in 1985 and produced its soundtrack. In 1990 he teamed up with Time Warner Inc to form Quincy Jones Entertainment; in 1991 he helped create the NBC television series The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, which launched Will Smith on the road to superstardom; and in 1993 he set up VIBE.

By mid-October, nearly 70 individuals \u2013 some purporting to be election officials and volunteer poll watchers \u2013 had committed to the project, the documents show. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s initiative is just one of many being planned across the country, often at the local level, to uncover supposed instances of election fraud at polling sites, spurred on by Donald Trump\u2019s lies that the 2020 election was somehow fraudulent. Trump has already baselessly accused Pennsylvania election officials of \u201ccheating\u201d. The documents were provided to the Times by Kayla Dones, a former staff member of O\u2019Keefe Media Group, who recently resigned out of concerns that the project could land people in legal trouble. O\u2019Keefe, who resigned from Project Veritas in February 2023 after the group\u2019s governing board found that he had \u201cspent an excessive amount of donor funds on personal luxuries\u201d, described the project as \u201cfully legal\u201d. \u201cWhy on earth would I have arranged all this if I were secretly planning a criminal enterprise?\u201d he wrote in a post on social media.

It\u2019s also a place he feels profoundly connected to. \u201cWhenever I say: \u2018I\u2019m going home,\u2019 I mean I\u2019m going to Verona,\u201d said the Croatian. \u201cMy soul is linked to this city.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2024/nov/04/dortmund-rb-leipzig-bundesliga-jurgen-klopp\">Dortmund strike victory for their values in taking down RB Leipzig | Andy Brassell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Home is where the heart is, but that can leave you at risk of being stabbed in it. Italian journalists have nicknamed Romeo and Juliet\u2019s old haunt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/may/24/juventus-thank-their-lucky-stars-as-fatal-verona-hand-them-a-lifeline-serie-a\">\u201cFatal Verona\u201d</a> ever since the <em>Scaligeri</em> denied Milan the Serie A title by beating them on the final day of the 1972-73 season. Now, Juric\u2019s Roma tenure may have suffered a terminal wound there as well.</p> \n<p>The game started catastrophically, Nicola Zalewski somehow missing that Verona\u2019s Casper Tengstedt was between him and Gianluca Mancini when he attempted a crossfield pass in the 13th minute. The Danish striker intercepted and gratefully ran through to score. Roma responded through Mat\u00edas Soul\u00e9, with his first goal since a July move from Juventus coming via a mischievous heel flick.</p> \n<p>Verona went back in front five minutes later, Giangiacomo Magnani burying a near-post header from a corner. The story repeated in the second half. Roma equalised again through another summer signing, Artem Dovbyk, and continued to play on the front foot. But Verona sealed a 3-2 win with a goal on the counter, Dailon Livramento showing impressive strength to hold off Evan Ndicka before he centred the ball for Abdou Harroui to finish.</p> \n<p>Juric was defiantly optimistic at full time, arguing that Roma had played a dominant game and been undone only by individual mistakes and poor officiating. Magnani had struck Ndicka with his forearm while leaping to score Verona\u2019s second goal. \u201cUnfortunately, in football errors can be costly,\u201d said Juric. \u201cBoth those the players make and the referee.\u201d He said his team could build on this performance, but it is not clear whether Juric will be around long enough to oversee further construction. Reports were circulating soon after the final whistle that he could be fired as soon as Monday.</p> \n<p>In truth, like Shakespeare\u2019s star-crossed lovers, Juric might have been doomed from the start. Roma\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/18/daniele-de-rossi-sacked-by-roma-after-seven-months-in-charge-of-serie-a-club\">decision to fire Daniele De Rossi</a> four games into this season \u2013 and only three months after they handed him a three-year contract extension \u2013 was met with such extreme anger from supporters that the family of the club\u2019s CEO, Lina Souloukou, had to be assigned a police escort. She announced her resignation four days after the managerial change.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/the-gentleman-ultra/2024/oct/31/nostalgic-serie-a-five-a-side-teams-picking-a-lineup-for-pisa\">Nostalgic Serie A five-a-side teams: picking a lineup for \u2026 Pisa</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Juric won his debut game in charge, 3-0 at home to Udinese. It was Roma\u2019s first win of this season, but also the first time in a long time that players had seen empty seats for a home game. Ultras from the Curva Sud boycotted the opening 30 minutes, leaving the stand empty save for a banner of protest. Anger was directed at ownership, not Juric, but it was nevertheless hard to imagine what he could do to win them over.</p> \n<p>Fans simply did not see themselves reflected in him as they had done with both of his predecessors. De Rossi was a son of the city, a Roman who grew up to be club captain. Before him was Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, who delivered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/25/roma-feyenoord-europa-conference-league-final-match-report\">a first piece of silverware in 14 years</a> and took the team to two European finals, all while bonding supporters to him with a familiar us-against-the world-rhetoric.</p> \n<p>What could Juric offer? He had done creditably consistent work with Verona and Torino, never finishing higher than ninth or lower than 10th for five consecutive seasons. But that hardly made an obvious profile for the manager of a club whose owners, Dan and Ryan Friedkin, put out a statement after De Rossi\u2019s sacking stressing their ambition \u201cto see Roma consistently compete at the highest levels of European football\u201d.</p> \n<p>The club urgently needs a return to the Champions League to justify an almost \u20ac100m outlay this summer on transfer fees for the likes of Dovbyk, Soul\u00e9 and Enzo Le F\u00e9e. Significant contracts were handed to free transfers Mats Hummels and Mario Hermoso, too, who have started one game between them. Paulo Dybala\u2019s rejection of a move to Saudi Arabia delighted fans but further exacerbated financial pressures and may have contributed to the decision to let Bove leave.</p> \n<p>That financial context helps explain why the club might have felt compelled to fire De Rossi, who won only one of his last 11 competitive games in charge. The Friedkins no doubt came to regret their decision to announce their intention to extend his contract in April \u2013 just before the team\u2019s form started to turn. De Rossi had initially only been intended as an interim appointment to see Roma through to the end of last season.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"403ab17f-e4d0-4a78-9830-c3fad4190885\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Sat:</b>&nbsp;Bologna 1-0 Lecce, Monza 0-1 Milan, Udinese 0-2 Juventus.<b> Sun:</b> Inter 1-0 Venezia, Napoli 0-3 Atalanta, Torino 0-1 Fiorentina, Verona 3-2 Roma.<b> Monday games:</b> Empoli v Como, Lazio v Cagliari, Parma v Genoa.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Who can they turn to now, though, if they decide that Juric is not the right man for the job? Paulo Sousa, Massimiliano Allegri and Maurizio Sarri\u2019s names have been floated by various media outlets, while Claudio Ranieri\u2019s Roman roots might restore some connections to disaffected supporters but for now that list all feels highly speculative.</p> \n<p>Already, the time to turn things around feels tight. After travelling to Union Saint-Gilloise for their Europa League game on Thursday, Roma\u2019s last match before the international break is against a Bologna side who have started to find their feet under Vincenzo Italiano. Then come appointments with the league leaders Napoli, Tottenham, and the Atalanta team that just thumped Napoli 3-0.</p> \n<p>Spooky season might indeed be over, but Roma\u2019s fixture list only gets scarier from here.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-table\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/tables/league/635\"> \n <table data-embed-type=\"table\"

It\u2019s also a place he feels profoundly connected to. \u201cWhenever I say: \u2018I\u2019m going home,\u2019 I mean I\u2019m going to Verona,\u201d said the Croatian. \u201cMy soul is linked to this city.\u201d Home is where the heart is, but that can leave you at risk of being stabbed in it. Italian journalists have nicknamed Romeo and Juliet\u2019s old haunt \u201cFatal Verona\u201d ever since the Scaligeri denied Milan the Serie A title by beating them on the final day of the 1972-73 season. Now, Juric\u2019s Roma tenure may have suffered a terminal wound there as well. The game started catastrophically, Nicola Zalewski somehow missing that Verona\u2019s Casper Tengstedt was between him and Gianluca Mancini when he attempted a crossfield pass in the 13th minute. The Danish striker intercepted and gratefully ran through to score. Roma responded through Mat\u00edas Soul\u00e9, with his first goal since a July move from Juventus coming via a mischievous heel flick. Verona went back in front five minutes later, Giangiacomo Magnani burying a near-post header from a corner. The story repeated in the second half. Roma equalised again through another summer signing, Artem Dovbyk, and continued to play on the front foot. But Verona sealed a 3-2 win with a goal on the counter, Dailon Livramento showing impressive strength to hold off Evan Ndicka before he centred the ball for Abdou Harroui to finish. Juric was defiantly optimistic at full time, arguing that Roma had played a dominant game and been undone only by individual mistakes and poor officiating. Magnani had struck Ndicka with his forearm while leaping to score Verona\u2019s second goal. \u201cUnfortunately, in football errors can be costly,\u201d said Juric. \u201cBoth those the players make and the referee.\u201d He said his team could build on this performance, but it is not clear whether Juric will be around long enough to oversee further construction. Reports were circulating soon after the final whistle that he could be fired as soon as Monday. In truth, like Shakespeare\u2019s star-crossed lovers, Juric might have been doomed from the start. Roma\u2019s decision to fire Daniele De Rossi four games into this season \u2013 and only three months after they handed him a three-year contract extension \u2013 was met with such extreme anger from supporters that the family of the club\u2019s CEO, Lina Souloukou, had to be assigned a police escort. She announced her resignation four days after the managerial change. Juric won his debut game in charge, 3-0 at home to Udinese. It was Roma\u2019s first win of this season, but also the first time in a long time that players had seen empty seats for a home game. Ultras from the Curva Sud boycotted the opening 30 minutes, leaving the stand empty save for a banner of protest. Anger was directed at ownership, not Juric, but it was nevertheless hard to imagine what he could do to win them over. Fans simply did not see themselves reflected in him as they had done with both of his predecessors. De Rossi was a son of the city, a Roman who grew up to be club captain. Before him was Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, who delivered a first piece of silverware in 14 years and took the team to two European finals, all while bonding supporters to him with a familiar us-against-the world-rhetoric. What could Juric offer? He had done creditably consistent work with Verona and Torino, never finishing higher than ninth or lower than 10th for five consecutive seasons. But that hardly made an obvious profile for the manager of a club whose owners, Dan and Ryan Friedkin, put out a statement after De Rossi\u2019s sacking stressing their ambition \u201cto see Roma consistently compete at the highest levels of European football\u201d. The club urgently needs a return to the Champions League to justify an almost \u20ac100m outlay this summer on transfer fees for the likes of Dovbyk, Soul\u00e9 and Enzo Le F\u00e9e. Significant contracts were handed to free transfers Mats Hummels and Mario Hermoso, too, who have started one game between them. Paulo Dybala\u2019s rejection of a move to Saudi Arabia delighted fans but further exacerbated financial pressures and may have contributed to the decision to let Bove leave. That financial context helps explain why the club might have felt compelled to fire De Rossi, who won only one of his last 11 competitive games in charge. The Friedkins no doubt came to regret their decision to announce their intention to extend his contract in April \u2013 just before the team\u2019s form started to turn. De Rossi had initially only been intended as an interim appointment to see Roma through to the end of last season. Who can they turn to now, though, if they decide that Juric is not the right man for the job? Paulo Sousa, Massimiliano Allegri and Maurizio Sarri\u2019s names have been floated by various media outlets, while Claudio Ranieri\u2019s Roman roots might restore some connections to disaffected supporters but for now that list all feels highly speculative. Already, the time to turn things around feels tight. After travelling to Union Saint-Gilloise for their Europa League game on Thursday, Roma\u2019s last match before the international break is against a Bologna side who have started to find their feet under Vincenzo Italiano. Then come appointments with the league leaders Napoli, Tottenham, and the Atalanta team that just thumped Napoli 3-0. Spooky season might indeed be over, but Roma\u2019s fixture list only gets scarier from here.",

      "bodyText": "Germany has condemned what it called \u201ca massive, coordinated attempt\u201d to prevent Moldovans abroad from voting in the second round of the country\u2019s presidential election. Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said vote-buying, manipulation and bomb threats against Moldovan polling stations \u2013 \u201ceven in Germany\u201d \u2013 were aimed at \u201cthe heart of European democracy\u201d, and showed that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, \u201cwill stop at nothing\u201d. A German foreign ministry spokesperson said polling stations in Hamburg, Frankfurt, Kaiserslautern and Berlin had been targeted by bomb threats, describing the intimidation as \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d. The remarks came as Europe\u2019s most powerful leaders congratulated Moldova\u2019s pro-western president, Maia Sandu, after she won a second term, cementing the country\u2019s EU aspirations and dealing a setback to the Kremlin. With nearly 98% of the vote counted in the second round of the presidential elections on Sunday, Sandu had 54% of the vote, ahead of Alexandr Stoianoglo, a Kremlin-friendly political newcomer, backed by the pro-Russia party of Socialists. The party described Sandu as an \u201cillegitimate president\u201d on Monday. Moldovan authorities reported evidence of attempts to meddle in the electoral process before Sunday\u2019s vote and during the first round of voting and a referendum on EU membership that was won by a wafer-thin margin two weeks earlier. Allegations of Russian or pro-Russia interference, including cyber-attacks on polling stations, bussing in voters, vote-buying and intimidation, underscored the stakes for the small former Soviet republic that has pursued a decisively pro-western path under Sandu, seeking to join the EU. Moldova\u2019s foreign ministry said on Sunday that polling stations in Frankfurt, as well as Liverpool and Northampton in the UK, had been targeted by false bomb threats \u201cintended only to stop the voting process\u201d. On Monday the US president, Joe Biden, hailed Sandu\u2019s victory as a win for democracy and said Russia had failed to undermine the former Soviet republic. \u201cFor months, Russia sought to undermine Moldova\u2019s democratic institutions and election processes. But Russia failed,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe Moldovan people have exercised their democratic right to choose their own future, and they have chosen to pursue a path aligned with Europe and democracies everywhere,\u201d he added in a statement. That sentiment was echoed by European leaders. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cIt takes a rare kind of strength to overcome the challenges you [Sandu] have faced in this election. I\u2019m glad to continue working with you towards a European future for Moldova and its people.\u201d In a joint statement, the commission and the EU\u2019s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, praised the Moldovan authorities \u201cfor the successful conduct of the election, despite unprecedented interference by Russia, including with vote-buying schemes and disinformation\u201d, adding that \u201cthese hybrid attempts have sought to undermine the country\u2019s democratic institutions and its EU path\u201d. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said democracy had triumphed over all interference and manoeuvring: \u201cFrance will continue to remain at the side of Moldova in her European path,\u201d he wrote on X. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, agreed. \u201c@sandumaiamd has steered the Republic of Moldova safely through difficult times and set the country on a European course. We stand by Moldova\u2019s side,\u201d he said. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said his country was ready to support Moldova\u2019s European choice. \u201cMoldovans have made a clear choice \u2013 they chose a path toward economic growth and social stability. Only true security and a peaceful, united Europe can guarantee each person and every family the confidence to face tomorrow with hope and certainty.\u201d Moldova filed its application to join the EU in March 2022 only days after Ukraine announced its intention to become an EU member state, following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. Both countries were granted EU candidate status in June 2022 in an accelerated process. In the run-up to the first round of voting in the presidential elections, the commission proposed a \u20ac1.8bn (\u00a31.5bn) growth plan for Moldova, with the aim of doubling the size of the Moldovan economy over the next 10 years. The plan links financial aid (grants and cheap loans) to reforms, but still has to be agreed by EU member states and the European parliament, a five- or six-month process. Siegfried Mure\u0219an, a Romanian MEP who will lead talks for the European parliament on the Moldova growth plan, promised the EU would pass the legislation as quickly as possible \u201cso we can enable the necessary investments needed to help the country modernise and be prepared for EU accession\u201d. He described the result as \u201ca victory for the citizens of the Republic of Moldova and a defeat for the Russian Federation\u201d. The Kremlin has denied interfering in the vote. \u201cWe resolutely reject any accusations that we are somehow interfering in this. We are not doing this,\u201d the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said. A senior Russian senator and an ally of Putin said on Monday that votes were \u201cbrought in\u201d to help Sandu win. \u201cYou count the votes, you see how many the \u2018right\u2019 candidate is missing and bring in the required number of votes from foreign polling stations,\u201d said Andrei Klishas, a member of Russia\u2019s Federation Council, referring to diaspora voting. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry described the election as the \u201cmost undemocratic\u201d in Moldova\u2019s post-Soviet history. Spokeswoman Maria Zakarova said the outcome exposed a \u201cdeep split\u201d in Moldovan society. One EU leader conspicuous by his silence in the immediate aftermath of the vote was Viktor Orb\u00e1n. The Hungarian prime minister angered EU officials last week when he flew to Georgia the day after parliamentary elections, having offered his congratulations to the pro-Russian ruling party before the final tally had been officially announced. In the first 12 hours after the results of Moldova\u2019s election became clear, Orb\u00e1n had not immediately commented to international media.

Prep 15 min Cook 30 min Serves 2 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs Sea salt flakes 40g salted butter, cubed 1 tbsp olive oil 4 strips lemon zest 4-5 sprigs rosemary 5 garlic cloves, peeled and bashed For the butter bean mash 90ml olive oil 1 garlic clove, peeled and thinly sliced Juice and finely grated zest of 1 lemon 700g jar butter beans (or 2 x 400g tins), drained and rinsed For the greens 1 tbsp olive oil \u00bd tsp chilli flakes 1 tsp fennel seeds 200g rainbow chard, roughly sliced Juice of \u00bd lemon Trim off any excess fat and skin around the edges of the chicken thighs, leaving all the skin on top, then cut three deep slashes down to the bone in each thigh. Season the skin liberally with a teaspoon of sea salt in total, then set aside for five minutes. Heat the oven to 230C (210C fan)/450F/gas 8. Lay the chicken thighs skin side down in a medium-sized ovenproof frying pan, then put the pan on a medium heat. Leave the chicken to cook undisturbed for 10 minutes, then flip over so it\u2019s skin side up. Tuck the butter, oil, lemon zest, rosemary and garlic in between the thighs and, as soon as the butter melts, baste all over the crisped skin. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast for 20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Meanwhile, make the butter bean mash. Put the olive oil, garlic and lemon zest in a large frying pan on a very low heat, and warm for three to four minutes \u2013 you\u2019re not aiming to get any colour on the garlic. Put the butter beans in a high-speed blender or food processor, then tip in the infused oil, garlic and lemon zest, using a spatula to scrape everything out of the pan. Add the lemon juice and a teaspoon of sea salt flakes if you\u2019re using tinned beans (jarred are quite salty already, so you will most likely not need any extra), then blitz very smooth. Once the chicken is cooked, take the pan out of the oven and let it rest for five minutes. Meanwhile, for the greens, put the olive oil in a saucepan on a medium heat, add the chilli flakes and fennel seeds, and fry for 30 seconds. Add the chard, stir-fry for four to five minutes, until softenedthen season with a half-teaspoon of salt and the lemon juice, adding more of each as you wish. Put the butter bean mash in a saucepan and heat it through gently, then serve with the chicken and the greens alongside.",

      "body": "<p>When was the last time we spent so much mental energy attempting to decipher the result of a <em>TopSpiel</em>? The weekly Saturday early evening showcase in the Bundesliga is often the biggest and best of the weekend and a game that intrigues and satisfies, but this latest episode of Borussia Dortmund versus RB Leipzig caught us all on the hop.</p> \n<p>The wind, after all, seemed to be blowing one way. BVB had suffered three consecutive defeats with varying degrees of misery \u2013 the eventual 5-2 loss at Real Madrid in which they had played pretty well for most of the game, the 2-1 at Augsburg in which they certainly didn\u2019t, and the extra-time 1-0 loss at Wolfsburg in midweek which ended their interest in the DfB Pokal. There was little to suggest that Dortmund were the team to bring Leipzig\u2019s 19-game unbeaten run in the Bundesliga to a juddering halt. Yet Nuri Sahin\u2019s side did just that and convincingly so, with style and substance. It was a result that required a thorough explanation.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/04/ligue-1-rennes-julien-stephan-auxerre-monaco\">Rennes\u2019 turnover model becomes talent trap in season of reckoning | Eric Devin</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Both coaches offered their own theories. Sahin put forward a blast from the past, revealing he went back over the copious notes he took as a player with coaching aspirations and tried an old Thomas Tuchel tactic which had helped his team roll over Leipzig in the incendiary first version of this fixture back in 2017. Tuchel had used a single defensive midfielder, a ball-playing midfielder in a deeper role, to exploit the spaces left in Leipzig\u2019s 4-2-2-2. The plan had been to use Sahin himself but, as regrettably often during his second spell at the club, he was injured so Julian Weigl filled the role instead. Felix Nmecha stepped in on Saturday and \u201cthe boy did very well,\u201d in Sahin\u2019s words.</p> \n<p>On the other side, Marco Rose suggested his team, one of the Bundesliga\u2019s very best, showed a lack of experience in dealing with the occasion. \u201cIn games like this, where we [have the chance to] pull away and get ourselves a statement win,\u201d Rose lamented, \u201cwe can lack courage and conviction. We need to take it as a lesson for the next few weeks. As a Champions League team, we have to believe in ourselves more in stadiums like this, against opponents like this.\u201d</p> \n<p>These games are rarely damp squibs. It is not a derby or a <em>Klassiker</em>, but when Borussia Dortmund and RB Leipzig meet it is more than a match and more than a bit of needle. It is a clash of diametrically opposed philosophies, recently brought more sharply into focus by J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s surprise move to Red Bull, which profoundly shook many Dortmunders. If the array of anti-RB banners on the Yellow Wall will never match the sea of them that came out to float on Leipzig\u2019s first visit in 2017, some still appeared on Saturday, a few taking issue with Klopp himself.</p> \n<p>What gives this game its extra edge is BVB\u2019s self-appointed role \u2013 seen as self-righteous by many rival fans \u2013 as a protector of German football\u2019s traditional values. Yet all these years on from Leipzig\u2019s introduction to the top flight, some observers have started to broach the question of whether those traditions are limiting, Klopp\u2019s choice hinting that might be a growing feeling among people in the game. \u201cWhen Klopp starts on 1 January,\u201d wrote Bild\u2019s Alfred Draxler in a recent editorial, \u201che can do whatever he wants with leaner structures and less sentimentality.\u201d</p> \n<p>In terms of the current picture, there appears to be a growing gap in terms of focus and strategy. Already, this match felt potentially season-defining. A win at Signal Iduna Park would have moved Leipzig 10 points clear of BVB. Now the gap is just four, which seems a modest expression of what has felt like a real gulf between the two teams\u2019 directions in the opening stanza of this season. That is a relief to Dortmund, and to Sahin. Any pressure on the rookie coach has been from the outside rather than inside the club \u2013 there is an acute awareness a rebuild will take time \u2013 but that has not diminished the discomfort or alarm in the team\u2019s chaotic season so far.</p> \n<p>All of which made this performance \u2013 one of passion, invention and composure \u2013 such an exhilarating surprise for those of a black-and-yellow persuasion. The hosts had started well but when Benjamin Sesko gave the visitors the lead with their first effort on target \u2013 and Jamie Gittens missed an almost immediate chance to equalise \u2013 there was no panic. Maximilian Beier levelled with his overdue first goal for the club before later eking out the cross from which Serhou Guirassy headed home the winner.</p> \n<p>It should not have been possible. Injuries have left Sahin over a barrel. Leipzig\u2019s Willi Orban regretted his side\u2019s inability to raise the tempo \u201cbecause we knew that Dortmund might have problems bringing quality off the bench\u201d. When naming his squad for the match on Friday, Sahin had called up eight players from the under-23s to supplement his first team. One of them, Ayman Azhil, made his debut as a substitute in the second half when Marcel Sabitzer was unable to carry on.</p> \n<p>Beier\u2019s form thus far had hardly demanded inclusion, but the current personnel situation had demanded he persevere, and that Sahin persevere with him. Now, this could be a landmark game for the young forward, signed for \u20ac30m from Hoffenheim this summer. Whether it will be for BVB, only time will tell. There are likely to be further setbacks. But the relief that under such pressure and an avalanche of absences there is still a way to be found is relief enough for now; and perhaps as importantly, an endorsement of their continued identity.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 The big winners of the weekend were Bayern, with Harry Kane\u2019svirtuoso centre-forward display \u2013with two goals and a delicious assist for Kingsley Coman \u2013 steering them to a comfortable 3-0 win over a gnarly Union Berlin, moving them three points clear of Leipzig at the summit. Seeing Bayern begin to recover their merciless selves reminds us how long they have been below club standards; a third consecutive Bundesliga clean sheet was, remarkably, their first in four-and-a-half years. Now, attention turns to the Champions League, where two defeats in three have made Wednesday\u2019s visit of Benfica a big one or, as Jo\u00e3o Palhinha said: \u201cA final for us.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"26fe0f1b-b359-487b-bf53-c6be90a2458e\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Bayer Leverkusen 0-0 Stuttgart, Bayern 3-0 Union Berlin, Eintracht Frankfurt 7-2 Bochum, Hoffenheim 0-2 St Pauli, Holstein Kiel 1-0 Heidenheim, Wolfsburg 1-1 Augsburg, Dortmund 2-1 Leipzig, Freiburg 0-0 Mainz, M\u00f6nchengladbach 4-1 Werder Bremen</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 Perhaps even more pertinently, Bayern now lead Leverkusen by seven points after the champions dropped points for a second straight week in a home stalemate with Stuttgart. Matches between last season\u2019s top two have been unmissable for a while so a goalless draw was a genuine shock. The main architect of the result was visiting goalkeeper Alexander N\u00fcbel, outstanding in keeping Leverkusen at bay as he pitches to be Germany\u2019s No 1. There was strange satisfaction for <em>Die Werkself</em> at a first Bundesliga clean sheet and what Granit Xhaka described as \u201cdefinitely our best performance of the season\u201d, before Xabi Alonso\u2019s Tuesday return to Anfield.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Three cheers too for Holstein Kiel, first-time winners over Heidenheim and now four points clear of last place after crisis club Bochum were flamed 7-2 at Eintracht Frankfurt, who sit third.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-table\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/tables/league/625\"> \n <table

      "bodyText": "When was the last time we spent so much mental energy attempting to decipher the result of a TopSpiel? The weekly Saturday early evening showcase in the Bundesliga is often the biggest and best of the weekend and a game that intrigues and satisfies, but this latest episode of Borussia Dortmund versus RB Leipzig caught us all on the hop. The wind, after all, seemed to be blowing one way. BVB had suffered three consecutive defeats with varying degrees of misery \u2013 the eventual 5-2 loss at Real Madrid in which they had played pretty well for most of the game, the 2-1 at Augsburg in which they certainly didn\u2019t, and the extra-time 1-0 loss at Wolfsburg in midweek which ended their interest in the DfB Pokal. There was little to suggest that Dortmund were the team to bring Leipzig\u2019s 19-game unbeaten run in the Bundesliga to a juddering halt. Yet Nuri Sahin\u2019s side did just that and convincingly so, with style and substance. It was a result that required a thorough explanation. Both coaches offered their own theories. Sahin put forward a blast from the past, revealing he went back over the copious notes he took as a player with coaching aspirations and tried an old Thomas Tuchel tactic which had helped his team roll over Leipzig in the incendiary first version of this fixture back in 2017. Tuchel had used a single defensive midfielder, a ball-playing midfielder in a deeper role, to exploit the spaces left in Leipzig\u2019s 4-2-2-2. The plan had been to use Sahin himself but, as regrettably often during his second spell at the club, he was injured so Julian Weigl filled the role instead. Felix Nmecha stepped in on Saturday and \u201cthe boy did very well,\u201d in Sahin\u2019s words. On the other side, Marco Rose suggested his team, one of the Bundesliga\u2019s very best, showed a lack of experience in dealing with the occasion. \u201cIn games like this, where we [have the chance to] pull away and get ourselves a statement win,\u201d Rose lamented, \u201cwe can lack courage and conviction. We need to take it as a lesson for the next few weeks. As a Champions League team, we have to believe in ourselves more in stadiums like this, against opponents like this.\u201d These games are rarely damp squibs. It is not a derby or a Klassiker, but when Borussia Dortmund and RB Leipzig meet it is more than a match and more than a bit of needle. It is a clash of diametrically opposed philosophies, recently brought more sharply into focus by J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s surprise move to Red Bull, which profoundly shook many Dortmunders. If the array of anti-RB banners on the Yellow Wall will never match the sea of them that came out to float on Leipzig\u2019s first visit in 2017, some still appeared on Saturday, a few taking issue with Klopp himself. What gives this game its extra edge is BVB\u2019s self-appointed role \u2013 seen as self-righteous by many rival fans \u2013 as a protector of German football\u2019s traditional values. Yet all these years on from Leipzig\u2019s introduction to the top flight, some observers have started to broach the question of whether those traditions are limiting, Klopp\u2019s choice hinting that might be a growing feeling among people in the game. \u201cWhen Klopp starts on 1 January,\u201d wrote Bild\u2019s Alfred Draxler in a recent editorial, \u201che can do whatever he wants with leaner structures and less sentimentality.\u201d In terms of the current picture, there appears to be a growing gap in terms of focus and strategy. Already, this match felt potentially season-defining. A win at Signal Iduna Park would have moved Leipzig 10 points clear of BVB. Now the gap is just four, which seems a modest expression of what has felt like a real gulf between the two teams\u2019 directions in the opening stanza of this season. That is a relief to Dortmund, and to Sahin. Any pressure on the rookie coach has been from the outside rather than inside the club \u2013 there is an acute awareness a rebuild will take time \u2013 but that has not diminished the discomfort or alarm in the team\u2019s chaotic season so far. All of which made this performance \u2013 one of passion, invention and composure \u2013 such an exhilarating surprise for those of a black-and-yellow persuasion. The hosts had started well but when Benjamin Sesko gave the visitors the lead with their first effort on target \u2013 and Jamie Gittens missed an almost immediate chance to equalise \u2013 there was no panic. Maximilian Beier levelled with his overdue first goal for the club before later eking out the cross from which Serhou Guirassy headed home the winner. It should not have been possible. Injuries have left Sahin over a barrel. Leipzig\u2019s Willi Orban regretted his side\u2019s inability to raise the tempo \u201cbecause we knew that Dortmund might have problems bringing quality off the bench\u201d. When naming his squad for the match on Friday, Sahin had called up eight players from the under-23s to supplement his first team. One of them, Ayman Azhil, made his debut as a substitute in the second half when Marcel Sabitzer was unable to carry on. Beier\u2019s form thus far had hardly demanded inclusion, but the current personnel situation had demanded he persevere, and that Sahin persevere with him. Now, this could be a landmark game for the young forward, signed for \u20ac30m from Hoffenheim this summer. Whether it will be for BVB, only time will tell. There are likely to be further setbacks. But the relief that under such pressure and an avalanche of absences there is still a way to be found is relief enough for now; and perhaps as importantly, an endorsement of their continued identity. Talking points \u2022 The big winners of the weekend were Bayern, with Harry Kane\u2019svirtuoso centre-forward display \u2013with two goals and a delicious assist for Kingsley Coman \u2013 steering them to a comfortable 3-0 win over a gnarly Union Berlin, moving them three points clear of Leipzig at the summit. Seeing Bayern begin to recover their merciless selves reminds us how long they have been below club standards; a third consecutive Bundesliga clean sheet was, remarkably, their first in four-and-a-half years. Now, attention turns to the Champions League, where two defeats in three have made Wednesday\u2019s visit of Benfica a big one or, as Jo\u00e3o Palhinha said: \u201cA final for us.\u201d \u2022 Perhaps even more pertinently, Bayern now lead Leverkusen by seven points after the champions dropped points for a second straight week in a home stalemate with Stuttgart. Matches between last season\u2019s top two have been unmissable for a while so a goalless draw was a genuine shock. The main architect of the result was visiting goalkeeper Alexander N\u00fcbel, outstanding in keeping Leverkusen at bay as he pitches to be Germany\u2019s No 1. There was strange satisfaction for Die Werkself at a first Bundesliga clean sheet and what Granit Xhaka described as \u201cdefinitely our best performance of the season\u201d, before Xabi Alonso\u2019s Tuesday return to Anfield. \u2022 Three cheers too for Holstein Kiel, first-time winners over Heidenheim and now four points clear of last place after crisis club Bochum were flamed 7-2 at Eintracht Frankfurt, who sit third.",

Shouldn\u2019t &nbsp;I&nbsp;save my energy?\u201d The people who were inclined to remain sheltered during a blizzard, when the prospect of obtaining food was low, were more likely to live and pass on their genes to the next generation.

The question is: what do we stand to lose by following our inclination to prioritise comfort and convenience? Few people would argue with the fact that, say, washing machines, trains and telephones have freed us to lead more fulfilling and creative lives.

Likewise, the explosion of metabolic problems over the past several decades that can be&nbsp;directly attributed to sedentary lifestyles and&nbsp;a&nbsp;reliance on convenient, calorie-dense but nutrient\u2011poor&nbsp;food. Levels of loneliness have become sufficiently&nbsp;problematic that the UK has had a&nbsp;\u201cminister&nbsp;for loneliness\u201d since 2018.

The sense of safety you get from staying home can make it more anxiety-inducing to go out later. The relief of avoiding an uncomfortable conversation with your spouse makes that conversation even harder to have subsequently. Using a dating app to avoid the awkwardness of flirting only weakens your social skills over time. Continually choosing the convenient path lessens your&nbsp;ability to deal with unavoidable difficulties. And,&nbsp;from an evolutionary perspective, some measure of discomfort is just as crucial to our survival as rest and relaxation. Our ancestors didn\u2019t survive purely by being lazy, but through a combination of playing it safe and taking judicious risks: for example, pushing through the pain and effort of leaving a familiar home, in order to reap the rewards of a place closer to sources of food and better protected from the elements.</p> <p>Modern hyper-convenience is a kind of deal with the devil. It is seductive because it appeals to our instincts, but it surreptitiously depletes us. It has made it easier to get by, but in many ways harder to truly succeed. Human flourishing and happiness is not just about subsistence, but also depends on growth, dynamic problem-solving, and solidarity through hardship.</p> <p>Much of my work with my younger clients has been focused not on deep psychological conflict or the impact of trauma, but on approaching the basic tasks of living, such as making friends, handling work stress, or going to new places.

Meeting these goals always involves some kind of inconvenience, but it is this difficulty itself that shapes and develops our character.</p> <p>In the technological world we have fashioned, we must sometimes make a conscious effort to act in opposition to our instincts.

Modern hyper-convenience is a kind of deal with the devil. It is seductive because it appeals to our instincts, but it surreptitiously depletes us. It has made it easier to get by, but in many ways harder to truly succeed. Human flourishing and happiness is not just about subsistence, but also depends on growth, dynamic problem-solving, and solidarity through hardship. Much of my work with my younger clients has been focused not on deep psychological conflict or the impact of trauma, but on approaching the basic tasks of living, such as making friends, handling work stress, or going to new places. What they tell me repeatedly is that the discomfort of such tasks feels overwhelming, and their worlds are shrinking in consequence. Ideally, today\u2019s conveniences should serve as the support systems that help us move towards worthwhile goals, be they exercising for better health, building a career, raising a family, making a work of art, or teaching and mentoring others. Meeting these goals always involves some kind of inconvenience, but it is this difficulty itself that shapes and develops our character. In the technological world we have fashioned, we must sometimes make a conscious effort to act in opposition to our instincts. As a culture, we must remember \u2013 and remind our young people \u2013 that while convenience feels good in the moment, our capacity to adapt and overcome challenges is part of our evolutionary heritage too, and central to the adventure of life. \u2022 Dr Alex Curmi is a psychiatrist, trainee psychotherapist and presenter of The Thinking Mind podcast.

Along the way he made more than 350 first-team appearances, establishing himself as a cult hero at Sunderland\u2019s former Roker Park home.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/04/herman-ouseley-stood-up-to-be-counted-when-football-was-failing-to-act-on-racism\">Herman Ouseley stood up to be counted when football was failing to act on racism | Troy Townsend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In many ways they were magical years for a very fine centre-half but Bennett also suffered appalling racist abuse. \u201cMy arrival was a big shock for the football club and for the city of Sunderland,\u201d the 62-year-old says over coffee at a hotel near his home in Durham. \u201cYou could see people thinking: \u2018What\u2019s he doing up here?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Wearside\u2019s demographic was then so overwhelmingly white that Sunderland\u2019s manager at the time, Len Ashurst, had lengthy discussions with the board before Bennett, previously with Manchester City and Cardiff, signed in 1984. \u201cOut at night in the car I was always being stopped,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAt time it was very rare to see someone of colour in the north-east. I was always asked what I was doing in the north-east. The same happened when I tried to go into bars and nightclubs but the club was 100% behind me and they complained to the police.\u201d</p> <p>After being coached by the colourblind Malcolm Allison \u2013 \u201ca man ahead of his time,\u201d says Bennett \u2013 at Manchester City and making his professional breakthrough under the \u201cwonderful\u201d Ashurst in Cardiff, he was entering uncharted territory. \u201cLen had a long conversation with Sunderland\u2019s board about signing a black player,\u201d he says. \u201cI was something new for the supporters.\u201d</p> <p>As Sunderland\u2019s club historian, Rob Mason, details in his excellent, recently published Sunderland AFC: The Definitive History, Roly Gregoire had struggled to cope with the demands of becoming the team\u2019s first player of colour during the 1977-78 campaign. \u201cSadly,\u201d writes Mason. \u201cThe amount of discrimination at that time meant that a black player would have had to be brilliant.\u201d</p>    <p>If Bennett\u2019s ability soon won over Sunderland fans, much remained imperfect. \u201cThere was a lot of ignorance from managers, coaches and other players,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then, on television at the time you\u2019d have Alf Garnett in Death us Do Part, the Black and White Minstrel Show and Love thy Neighbour. You just went along with it, you didn\u2019t challenge it. You\u2019d watch an England game on TV and hear the chants of \u2018Ain\u2019t no black in the Union Jack\u2019 and think: \u2018Oh.\u2019 But we were all ignorant then, myself included.</p> <p>\u201cYou just got on with things but you do still remember racist incidents, where it happened, who did it. It lives with you \u2013 it\u2019s not a nice experience. You didn\u2019t know how to handle it. I got really angry a couple of times. It\u2019s only when you educate yourself a bit more that you learn how to deal with it.\u201d</p> <p>These days Bennett, awarded the MBE in 2022, is very much an educator. He combines his longstanding role as BBC Radio Newcastle\u2019s Sunderland match co-commentator with anti-racism campaigning, most frequently for Show Racism the Red Card, the charity founded by Ged Grebby in the north-east in 1996 when Bennett, Newcastle\u2019s Shaka Hislop and Middlesbrough\u2019s Curtis Fleming became its three figureheads.

      "bodyText": "Whenever Gary Bennett glances in his rear-view mirror and spots a police car, he tenses. \u201cI don\u2019t get stopped nowadays,\u201d says the former Sunderland captain. \u201cBut it\u2019s still always on my mind that they\u2019re going to pull me over.\u201d It is 40 years since Bennett became the second black player to pull on the famous red and white stripes yet the memories of his 11 seasons at the heart of the club\u2019s defence remain vivid. Along the way he made more than 350 first-team appearances, establishing himself as a cult hero at Sunderland\u2019s former Roker Park home. In many ways they were magical years for a very fine centre-half but Bennett also suffered appalling racist abuse. \u201cMy arrival was a big shock for the football club and for the city of Sunderland,\u201d the 62-year-old says over coffee at a hotel near his home in Durham. \u201cYou could see people thinking: \u2018What\u2019s he doing up here?\u2019\u201d Wearside\u2019s demographic was then so overwhelmingly white that Sunderland\u2019s manager at the time, Len Ashurst, had lengthy discussions with the board before Bennett, previously with Manchester City and Cardiff, signed in 1984. \u201cOut at night in the car I was always being stopped,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAt time it was very rare to see someone of colour in the north-east. I was always asked what I was doing in the north-east. The same happened when I tried to go into bars and nightclubs but the club was 100% behind me and they complained to the police.\u201d After being coached by the colourblind Malcolm Allison \u2013 \u201ca man ahead of his time,\u201d says Bennett \u2013 at Manchester City and making his professional breakthrough under the \u201cwonderful\u201d Ashurst in Cardiff, he was entering uncharted territory. \u201cLen had a long conversation with Sunderland\u2019s board about signing a black player,\u201d he says. \u201cI was something new for the supporters.\u201d As Sunderland\u2019s club historian, Rob Mason, details in his excellent, recently published Sunderland AFC: The Definitive History, Roly Gregoire had struggled to cope with the demands of becoming the team\u2019s first player of colour during the 1977-78 campaign. \u201cSadly,\u201d writes Mason. \u201cThe amount of discrimination at that time meant that a black player would have had to be brilliant.\u201d If Bennett\u2019s ability soon won over Sunderland fans, much remained imperfect. \u201cThere was a lot of ignorance from managers, coaches and other players,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then, on television at the time you\u2019d have Alf Garnett in Death us Do Part, the Black and White Minstrel Show and Love thy Neighbour. You just went along with it, you didn\u2019t challenge it. You\u2019d watch an England game on TV and hear the chants of \u2018Ain\u2019t no black in the Union Jack\u2019 and think: \u2018Oh.\u2019 But we were all ignorant then, myself included. \u201cYou just got on with things but you do still remember racist incidents, where it happened, who did it. It lives with you \u2013 it\u2019s not a nice experience. You didn\u2019t know how to handle it. I got really angry a couple of times. It\u2019s only when you educate yourself a bit more that you learn how to deal with it.\u201d These days Bennett, awarded the MBE in 2022, is very much an educator. He combines his longstanding role as BBC Radio Newcastle\u2019s Sunderland match co-commentator with anti-racism campaigning, most frequently for Show Racism the Red Card, the charity founded by Ged Grebby in the north-east in 1996 when Bennett, Newcastle\u2019s Shaka Hislop and Middlesbrough\u2019s Curtis Fleming became its three figureheads. Hislop was inspired to change the narrative after being told to \u201cgo back to your own country\u201d and worse while filling up his car near St James\u2019 Park only to turn round and face a set of abusers who, realising he was Newcastle\u2019s goalkeeper, demanded his autograph. If significant strides have been made, black managers remain rare. \u201cI\u2019m one of the lucky ones,\u201d says Bennett, who had a brief stint in charge of Darlington. \u201cBut I remember going to a directors\u2019 lounge after a match and the attendant trying to bar me. The look on his face when I told him I was the manager said everything. When the team was losing my skin colour put pressure on the chairman. Even now boardrooms are 99% white; people have no real understanding of discrimination if they haven\u2019t experienced it.\u201d In his early broadcasting days Bennett was a rare black face in \u2013 still largely white and male \u2013 press boxes. \u201cOften I was the only one going into a press room asked who I was representing,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd discrimination isn\u2019t always verbal.

If you have a commercial health plan and go to your insurance website and say, \u2018I want a provider\u2019 and put in your zip code, it looks like there are a lot of people taking patients.\u201d More than half of Americans live in a mental health provider shortage area \u2013 and the problem is expected to grow more acute by 2036. \u201cWe see in our state there\u2019s a significantly higher percentage of patients who have to go out-of-network to access vital mental health resources,\u201d said Breedlove. For those that do accept insurance, mental health providers are generally paid only $0.76 for every $1 paid to primary care providers, who cover physical health. Breedlove is advocating for a bill in Washington state that would peg insurance reimbursement rates for mental health care to inflation. With this cost-of-living adjustment, she hopes insurance will become more attractive to her colleagues. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have enough people in your network to have an adequate network then you have to pay them more to recruit them,\u201d said Abderholden. \u201cWhen that starts happening, we will see better access because we won\u2019t have people dropping out of the field. We will have people making enough to cover their student loans.\u201d",

Experts are preparing for Donald Trump to stage an aggressive attempt to challenge the election results if he appears to be losing Tuesday\u2019s vote, warning that such efforts will be far more organized than his attempt at overturning the result following the 2020 race. The former president has made it clear that he will contest the results if he loses \u2013 and election lawyers and voting rights experts say that this time, the effort to get Trump into the White House, regardless of the result, ranges from using the courts to local groups organizing election deniers to work the polls. From spreading the false idea that voter fraud is undercutting the election, to planning to sow chaos in states with slow vote counts, here are the ways that Trump and his allies are organizing. Just how close could the vote be? Analysts are predicting the closest election since 2000, when George W Bush won by 537 votes, and warning of the threat of civil unrest and political violence. Trump leans into anti-migrant rhetoric in Georgia while Harris promises Michigan she will do her best to end Gaza war Donald Trump stuck to familiar territory in his final Georgia rally on Sunday, criticising migrants and describing the US as \u201can occupied country\u201d, while Kamala Harris used her last event in Michigan to vow to \u201cdo everything in [her] power\u201d to end the Gaza war.

He also vowed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1790, the law under which Japanese, Italian and German-Americans were interned during the second world war. Meanwhile, anger over the Biden administration\u2019s position on the Israel-Gaza war means that many of Michigan\u2019s 240,000 registered Muslim voters are leaning towards the Green party candidate, Jill Stein, polling suggests. Where will Trump and Harris be on the final day of campaigning? Harris will be in three cities in Pennsylvania; Trump will make appearances in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Judge rules Iowa can challenge validity of hundreds of ballots from potential non-citizens A federal judge has ruled that Iowa can carry on challenging the validity of potential noncitizens\u2019 ballots, despite warnings from civil liberties groups that this may jeopardize the voting rights of recently naturalized US citizens. The US district judge Stephen Locher sided with the state in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of an Iowa Latino group and four recent citizens who had been added to a list of questionable registrations. The ruling is a boon for Republicans \u2013 Donald Trump has made voting by non-citizens a campaign issue, despite it being rare. How many people could be affected? While the judge said their names won\u2019t be taken off electoral rolls, potentially 2,000 could be required to use provisional ballots. What are the latest polls saying? The margins are razor-thin. The Guardian\u2019s national polling average has Kamala Harris at 48% and Trump at 47%, but the popular vote does not matter: the race will likely be determined by the results in just seven so-called swing states, where polling is equally tight. In other news \u2026 Quincy Jones, the American entertainment giant who produced albums by Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson, Aretha Franklin and many others, has died aged 91. The IDF claims it has killed a Hezbollah commander inside Lebanon, whom it named as Abu Ali Rida, saying that he commanded the southern Lebanon\u2019s Baraachit area. Hundreds heckled and threw mud at Spain\u2019s royals, its prime minister, and Valencia\u2019s regional leader during an official visit following last week\u2019s deadly floods. Four people have been injured, two of them seriously, in a fight involving an axe on a suburban train outside Paris, a police source said. Stat of the day: Authorities seize enough fentanyl to \u2018kill a quarter of California\u2019 In a major fentanyl bust in California\u2019s central valley officers seized enough lethal doses of the synthetic opioid to kill a quarter of the state\u2019s population, according to the California highway patrol (CHP). Don\u2019t miss this: School-leaver at 11, domestic slave at 12, gang member at 15 \u2013 how a missing birth certificate derailed a life Esther (not her real name) loved going to school as a pre-teen: it was an escape from her cramped home in the south side of Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi. But when her school demanded her birth certificate, which she did not have access to, to allow her to sit her exams, her life went into a downward spiral. Here is the story of how a lack of documentation locked her out of a better life, after she dropped out of school and ran away to seek domestic work, with abuse and lack of payment later leading her to join a gang. Climate check: Governments stress links between climate and nature collapse Governments have underlined that the climate crisis and biodiversity collapse are interconnected, after years of treating the two as separate challenges. But while the texts agreed at the end of the Cop16 biodiversity negotiations in Cali linked the two, it failed to include language on a phase out of fossil fuels.

      "body": "<h2>Fox gets timing right despite delayed flight</h2> <p>The Arsenal right-back Emily Fox defied her busier-than-usual international window to play a key role in their 1-1 draw at Manchester United. Fox was involved in all three of the United States\u2019 games between 25 and 30 October, including playing the final half an hour of their 3-0 victory over Argentina on Wednesday in Louisville, Kentucky. It is understood that the 26-year-old\u2019s flight home did not land until late on Friday afternoon, yet she was at her typically energetic best on Sunday. She played the full 90 minutes and crucially made a bursting run into the penalty area to unlock Manchester United\u2019s defence and provide the assist for Alessia Russo\u2019s opening goal. Arsenal\u2019s interim head coach, Renee Slegers, said: \u201cShe came back with a delayed flight and performs like this, I\u2019m very impressed. Foxy ended up making that run into the box pocket, and the timing of that run is just great, the first touch is very good and then her awareness of the run in the box, it\u2019s a very good part of her performance.\u201d <strong>TG</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/03/manchester-united-arsenal-wsl-womens-super-league-match-report\">Manchester United 1-1 Arsenal</a></p></li> </ul> <h2>Struggling Everton short on numbers</h2> <p>The Everton manager, Brian S\u00f8rensen, is hoping to add much-needed reinforcements to his injury-hit squad in the January transfer window after being forced to play players out of position in their 5-0 loss to Chelsea. The Greece winger Veatriki Sarri was deployed as a left-back in a makeshift lineup and the Dane said: \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever played left-back in her entire life and then she was against probably the best winger in the league at the minute [Johanna Rytting Kaneryd]. It was a tough ask for a lot of the players. We need to focus on getting numbers back.\u201d Asked if he will be busy in January, the Dane replied: \u201cI hope so, otherwise it\u2019s going to be a long season.\u201d Everton are last after six games on two points. <strong>TG</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/03/wsl-roundup-chelsea-thrash-everton-to-maintain-perfect-start\">Everton 0-5 Chelsea</a></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Parris thriving on the south coast</h2> <p>It is obvious that Nikita Parris is loving life at her new club, Brighton. After making the move to the south coast over the summer, the 30-year-old forward has now scored three in the last three games, sitting just one off Bunny Shaw\u2019s total in the scoring charts. Her 20th-minute finish on Sunday proved to be a vital winner for the Seagulls over Leicester, an instinctive header to turn home Jorelyn Carabali\u2019s cross. In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/18/nikita-parris-brighton-sarina-wiegman-england-manchester-united\">recent interview with the Guardian</a>, Parris was keen to praise her new manager Dario Vidosic\u2019s approach to football and his desire to set up a team at both ends of the pitch to thrive in possession. \u201cWe tried to attack with the ball and to also defend with the ball and then that way we were solid,\u201d he said after the win over Leicester that sent them up to third in the table. <strong>SD</strong></p> <h2>Park unlocks Palace\u2019s resistance</h2> <p>With every match she plays in a Manchester City shirt, Jess Park continues to come of age. Since the start of the year, the 23-year-old midfielder has established herself as one of the first names on Gareth Taylor\u2019s team sheet, ever reliable and ever capable of creating moments of magic. On Sunday, she was the key that unlocked Crystal Palace\u2019s stubborn first-half resistance. Realising that her side were struggling to break down the hosts\u2019 back five despite dominating, she spotted her opportunity from distance in the 40th minute with a sublime curling finish. It was the perfect time to score, giving the league leaders the platform from which to build. After Jill Roord had notched her second club goal since returning from an ACL injury, Park played an integral role in City\u2019s third when her pinpoint cross in from the right was headed home by Bunny Shaw. <strong>SD</strong></p> <h2>Hinds gets Liverpool back on track</h2> <p>Liverpool\u2019s Taylor Hinds struck twice in almost identical fashion in the club\u2019s 2-1 win over Aston Villa. The forward was prowling on the edge of the box for both goals. The ball was sent into the right area on both occasions with captain Hinds running in unmarked to score with one-touch finishes. The goals were enough to give the Reds all three points despite Villa\u2019s attempt to get something from the game after a Gabi Nunes\u2019 goal cut Liverpool\u2019s advantage in half. Victory for Liverpool has given the club their best away run in WSL history as they have gone eight consecutive games unbeaten on the road. The win for Liverpool means they are sixth but are level on points with fifth-place Arsenal, the clubs only separated by goal difference. <strong>SR</strong></p> <h2>Own goal costs struggling Hammers</h2> <p>West Ham\u2019s wait for their first win of the season continues despite being in front against Tottenham at half-time on Sunday. Riko Ueki had put the Hammers ahead in the first 45 but a goal from Beth England levelled the game and a crushing own goal in injury time by Camila S\u00e1ez gifted Spurs the win. In an attempt to prevent an on-running Lenna Gunning-Williams from scoring, S\u00e1ez lofted the ball into the air but in doing so she also lobbed her own keeper. It is the second time this season that S\u00e1ez has scored an own goal after also doing so against Everton. The loss means West Ham are 11th, on the same points as Aston Villa and Everton. <strong>SR</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-table\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/tables/league/961\"> <table data-embed-type=\"table\" class=\"table table--football table--striped\"> <thead> <tr> <th class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\"><abbr title=\"Position\">Pos</abbr></th> <th class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Team</th> <th class=\"football-stat--played\"><abbr title=\"Played\">P</abbr></th> <th class=\"football-stat--difference\"><abbr title=\"Goal difference\">GD</abbr></th> <th class=\"football-stat--points\"><abbr title=\"Points\">Pts</abbr></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">1</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Man City Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">6</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">8</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">16</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">2</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Chelsea Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">5</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">17</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">15</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">3</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">6</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">7</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">13</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">4</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Man Utd Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">5</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">7</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">11</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">5</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Arsenal Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">6</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">2</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">9</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">6</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Liverpool FC Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">6</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">1</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">9</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">7</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Tottenham Hotspur Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">6</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">-2</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">7</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">8</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Leicester Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">6</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">-3</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">5</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">9</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Crystal Palace Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">6</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">-13</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">4</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">10</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Aston Villa Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">6</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">-5</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">2</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">11</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">West Ham Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">6</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">-8</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">2</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">12</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Everton Women</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">6</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">-11</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">2</td> </tr>  </tbody> </table> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "Fox gets timing right despite delayed flight The Arsenal right-back Emily Fox defied her busier-than-usual international window to play a key role in their 1-1 draw at Manchester United. Fox was involved in all three of the United States\u2019 games between 25 and 30 October, including playing the final half an hour of their 3-0 victory over Argentina on Wednesday in Louisville, Kentucky. It is understood that the 26-year-old\u2019s flight home did not land until late on Friday afternoon, yet she was at her typically energetic best on Sunday. She played the full 90 minutes and crucially made a bursting run into the penalty area to unlock Manchester United\u2019s defence and provide the assist for Alessia Russo\u2019s opening goal. Arsenal\u2019s interim head coach, Renee Slegers, said: \u201cShe came back with a delayed flight and performs like this, I\u2019m very impressed. Foxy ended up making that run into the box pocket, and the timing of that run is just great, the first touch is very good and then her awareness of the run in the box, it\u2019s a very good part of her performance.\u201d TG Match report: Manchester United 1-1 Arsenal Struggling Everton short on numbers The Everton manager, Brian S\u00f8rensen, is hoping to add much-needed reinforcements to his injury-hit squad in the January transfer window after being forced to play players out of position in their 5-0 loss to Chelsea. The Greece winger Veatriki Sarri was deployed as a left-back in a makeshift lineup and the Dane said: \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever played left-back in her entire life and then she was against probably the best winger in the league at the minute [Johanna Rytting Kaneryd]. It was a tough ask for a lot of the players. We need to focus on getting numbers back.\u201d Asked if he will be busy in January, the Dane replied: \u201cI hope so, otherwise it\u2019s going to be a long season.\u201d Everton are last after six games on two points. TG Match report: Everton 0-5 Chelsea Parris thriving on the south coast It is obvious that Nikita Parris is loving life at her new club, Brighton. After making the move to the south coast over the summer, the 30-year-old forward has now scored three in the last three games, sitting just one off Bunny Shaw\u2019s total in the scoring charts. Her 20th-minute finish on Sunday proved to be a vital winner for the Seagulls over Leicester, an instinctive header to turn home Jorelyn Carabali\u2019s cross.

The UK, France and Russia were the only countries to vote on Friday night against a UN general assembly committee resolution drafted by Ireland and New Zealand to set up an international scientific inquiry to take a fresh look at the multifaceted impact of nuclear weapons use. Backers of the motion said the last such UN study had been carried out towards the end of the cold war and that a lot had changed since then, in geopolitics and in science. A total of 144 UN member states voted for the resolution, and 30 abstained, including the US. North Korea had been expected to vote no, but abstained.

Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the first men\u2019s one-day international between Australia and Pakistan. This is game one of a three-match series and today\u2019s action is coming to you from the Melbourne Cricket Ground. I\u2019m Angus Fontaine and I\u2019ll be steering you through the first fusillades of action.</p> <p>Although these countries met in January for a Test series won by Australia 3-0, it\u2019s been more than a year since they last crossed swords in the ODI format. That clash was at the 2023 World Cup clash in Bengaluru and Australia won by a 62-runs after a memorably mammoth opening stand of 259-runs between David Warner and Mitchell Marsh.</p> <p>Much to Pakistan\u2019s relief, neither of those veterans will be in the Australian squad today. Warner has retired at last and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/03/mitch-marsh-australia-captain-t20-cricket-world-cup-icc-twenty20-2024\">Marsh is on ice</a> (ie. paternity leave) for the upcoming Test series against India where he will have to shoulder the bowling load of the injured Cameron Green. With master blaster Travis Head also enjoying the flush of fatherhood, it will be Matt Short and Jake Fraser-McGurk opening for the men in gold.</p> <p>Pat Cummins returns as captain for Australia for this series and leads a formidable XI of Matt Short, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Steve Smith, Josh Inglis, Marnus Labuschagne, Aaron Hardie, Glenn Maxwell, Sean Abbott, Mitchell Starc and Adam Zampa.</p> <p>Pakistan are fresh from a stirring Test series victory over England in England and have a new white-ball captain in Mohammad Rizwan, the 32-year-old from Peshawar in his 73rd ODI for Pakistan. They also have some new blood in their matchday XI with batter Muhammad Irfan Khan to debut and Kamran Ghulam to play his second ODI. Their four-man pace attack shapes as Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah, Haris Rauf and the two-metre tall<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3NWgT28mP0\"> Mohammad Hasnain,</a> who has been clocked at 155.1 kph!</p> <p>Australia is experiencing a late-Spring heatwave so we have a warm, cloudy day in Melbourne and a clear forecast for this evening\u2019s day-nighter. Play gets under way at 2.30pm AEST and you\u2019re free to shoot me on <a href=\"mailto:angus.fontaine.casual@theguardian.com\">email </a>at any stage with interesting stats and stories, words of encouragement or clarifications for any errors as I clatter away.</p> <p>Until then batten \u2018em down and buckle \u2018em up because the action isn\u2019t far away.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for tonight. Thanks for your company, see you soon. Pat Cummins\u2019 verdict I always prefer sitting in the changing-room but yeah, we got it done. It got a bit tighter than we\u2019d have liked. I was really happy with the way the guys bowled; everyone played their really beautifully and to keep them to 203 was a great effort. We were really good for three-quarters of the runchase. We try to be aggressive with the bat and that won\u2019t always come off. But I think there\u2019s still room to build a couple of partnerships. Steve Smith\u2019s reaction They bowled alright in the middle there. They went quite short with the long boundaries \u2013 we kept taking it on and kept failing! Patty played nicely and Sabba [Sean Abbott] played pretty well before a bit of a brainfade. It\u2019s good to get over the line. It wasn\u2019t the easiest wicket to bat on. Some balls were stopping in the wicket and others were skidding on nicely. The bounce was a bit variable at times. But I felt good out there. I felt like I was balanced and moving well. I think Patty has his eyes done recently so they\u2019re obviously working well. What a terrific game that was. Australia were cruising at 113 for 2 before Haris Rauf found his way into the zone. He took three quick wickets to help reduce Australia to 159 for 7. At that stage Pakistan were slight favourites, but Pat Cummins batted with such authority to get Australia over the line. 33.3 overs: Australia 204-8 (Cummins 32, Starc 2) Pat Cummins has done it again! He thumps Hasnain down the ground for four to bring the scores level before forcing the winning run past backward point. Cummins finishes on 32 not out from 31 balls, another masterclass in lower-order finishing. Since the start of the 2023 Ashes, across all formats, he has scored 134 runs in successful Australian runchases without being dismissed. He\u2019s the new Michael Bevan! 33rd over: Australia 199-8 (Cummins 27, Starc 2) Rauf looks shattered, understandably after bowlign nine of the last 21 overs. Australia settle for a couple of easy singles, which brings the target down to five \u2013 and Cummins is on strike. 32nd over: Australia 197-8 (Cummins 26, Starc 1) Starc slashes a single off the last ball. Seven to win, Haris Rauf to bowl. It\u2019s now or never. 31.2 overs: Australia 196-8 (Cummins 26, Starc 0) Naseem Shah bowls two balls to Starc but then limps off with cramp. Mohammad Hasnain will complete the over. 31st over: Australia 196-8 (Cummins 26, Starc 0) Cummins slaps a short ball for Rauf for four; then, after a bouncer is called wide, he looped a couple more over backward point. Twelve to win. Eight to win because Cummins has just driven an imperious boundary over extra cover. That\u2019s a helluva shot. Cummins is fast developing a reputation as one of the great lower-order finishers. He\u2019s no Lance Klusener, admittedly, but his coolness and clarity under pressure are pretty remarkable. 30th over: Australia 185-8 (Cummins 16, Starc 0) Starc survives the last two balls from Shaheen Afridi, who finishes a fine spell with figures of 10-0-43-2. Nineteen to win. Another twist in this pulsating game! The non-striker Abbott was called through for a third run off Afridi, who collected a throw from the deep and demolished the stumps at the striker\u2019s end! Abbott, who looked reluctant to go for a third, wasn\u2019t sprinting and got a very nasty surprise. 29th over: Australia 181-7 (Abbott 13, Cummins 12) The dangerman Haris Rauf returns after a short break, perhaps too short. I guess Pakistan have no choice. Cummins survives a run-out chance after being sent back by Abbott. He was barely in the frame when Haris collected in his follow through, turned and threw this far wide of the stumps at the non-striker\u2019s end. Abbott clips the next ball just short of midwicket, then jumps across to work a precious boundary to fine leg. Suddenly Australia only need 23. 28th over: Australia 173-7 (Abbott 6, Cummins 11) Shaheen Afridi, who has two overs left, replaces Hasnain. Cummins smiles after a terrific bouncer zips past his right shoulder, and he and Abbott are content with three low-risk singles. 27th over: Australia 170-7 (Abbott 4, Cummins 10) Pakistan have decided to pepper the lower order, and so far it isn\u2019t working. Naseem bowls two more wides before he finds his length and drives Cummins back with some good short balls. The silly point \u2013 it\u2019s Kamran Ghulam \u2013 is still rabbiting on in an attempt to drag Cummins out of his bubble. Good luck with that. Time for drinks. Australia need 34 runs to win a memorable ODI. 26th over: Australia 167-7 (Abbott 3, Cummins 10) Cummins\u2019 batting usually goes to another level in tense situations: Birmingham, Mumbai, Christchurch, even his debut in Johannesburg. Cummins forces his first ball superbly through backward point for four, then gets a bit of a luck when an inside-edge whooshes past leg stump. A couple of short balls are called wide and then Cummins drags a pair of twos into the leg side. Not sure Pakistan can risk another over from Hasnain; he took an important wicket but also conceded 12 from the over. In other news, that 40 from Naseem Shah looks ever more valuable. Australia need 37 to win. Pakistan are three wickets away from an immense victory! Hardie backs away to cut Hasnain, misses and is cleaned up. For the umpteenth time in the last couple of years, Pat Cummins walks to the wicket just as the clock hits squeaky-bum time. 25th over: Australia 155-6 (Hardie 10, Abbott 3) After squeezing down some energy gel, Naseem Shah takes over from Haris Rauf. Abbott is beaten, trying to pull, then fences a short ball through the vacant short leg region. 24th over: Australia 154-6 (Hardie 9, Abbott 3) Mohammad Hasnain replaces Afridi, who has two overs remaining. Hardie is hit on the back thigh by a good nipbacker. The bowler doesn\u2019t appeal for LBW, then starts jumping around when he realises Rizwan has gone up. Pakistan ventually decide against a review, rightly so: it was bouncing over the top. Australia need 50 from 26. Overs, not balls. 23rd over: Australia 151-6 (Hardie 6, Abbott 3) Pakistan are full of the joys of haal. The man at silly point, not sure who it is, is chirping incessantly in a peculiar high-pitched squeak. Haris takes a brief time out after falling over in his delivery stride three times in a row. I think he scraped his left knee but he\u2019s okay. That said, he probably needs a breather after a scorching six-over spell. \u201cAm I right in thinking that this is an unusually old Australian team, especially in its bowling?\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cAfter India\u2019s shellacking at the hands of New Zealand, it does feel a bit like some of the familiar faces that have been at the heart of cricket may be on the way out. I suspect England might just be ahead of the curve a little by going very young, very early. Though there\u2019s nothing like small sample spaces to provoke a little confirmation bias.\u201d The probable XI for the first Test against India includes ten thirtysomethings. Then again, Australia have often had successful older teams; the one that marmalised England in 2006-07 had an average age of about 50. England\u2019s advantage, in the short term, might be that their best players are a year or two younger than Australia\u2019s and India\u2019s. 22nd over: Australia 148-6 (Hardie 5, Abbott 2) Rizwan may as well bowl his three senior quick bowlers out, because this game isn\u2019t going much beyond the 34th over (Hasnain has bowled four). Shaheen\u2019s eighth over is a quiet affair, including five consecutive dot balls to Hardie. 21st over: Australia 147-6 (Hardie 5, Abbott 1) Two big moments of fortune for Aaron Hardie! He fences Rauf just short of backward point, then edges a cut that flashes past the leaping Rizwan and away for four. Australia were strolling to victory at 113 for 2 and 139 for 3; now they\u2019re ina desperate fight for survival. Only Pakistan. 20.3 overs: Australia 140-6 (Hardie 0, Abbott 0) The hat-trick ball is too straight and clipped for a single by Abbott. Rauf put so much effort into it that he fell over, Mark Wood-style, then slapped the ground in frustration. Pakistan are in cornered tigers mode! Glenn Maxwell goes first ball, touching a seriously hot, back-of-a-length delivery from Haris Rauf through to Mohammad Rizwan. Only Pakistan can do this. Now then! Labuschagne gets in two minds and deflects a short ball from Rauf all the way down to third man, where Irfan Khan slides forward to take another good catch. It\u2019s his third of the innings and his second in the last four balls! 20th over: Australia 139-4 (Labuschagne 16, Hardie 0) Australia still have plenty of batting to come, including Glenn Maxwell. Even so, another quick wicket would make things interesting. A fantastic catch from Irfan Khan at deep midwicket! Inglis has pulled the previous ball for six \u2013 Irfan palmed it back into play quite brilliantly but stood on the boundary sponge before jumping \u2013 and tried to reach his fifty with a similar stroke. Irfan charged round the boundary and reached forward to take a terrific two-handed catch. 19th over: Australia 130-3 (Inglis 41, Labuschagne 15) Labuschagne squirts Rauf for three to move to 15 from 11 balls. He\u2019s often Australia\u2019s shepherd at No5, guiding them to a target after a flying start from the top four, but today he\u2019s playing with a breezy freedom. 18th over: Australia 123-3 (Inglis 40, Labuschagne 9) Pakistan\u2019s body language suggests they believe they can still win this, which depending on your perspective is either admirable or denialistic. Is that a word? It is now! Labuschagne moves Pakistan closer to defeat by driving Afridi expertly to the long-off boundary. 17th over: Australia 117-3 (Inglis 38, Labuschagne 4) Labuschagne gets off the mark by uppercutting Rauf over slip for four. Rauf is frustrated but it was a safe shot once Labuschagne got under the ball. Australia need 87 from 198 balls. Steve Smith is furious with himself. He was playing superbly, almost flawlessly, until suddenly he slapped a short ball straight to backward point. Saim Ayub took a smart catch, his second of the innings. Smith knows he\u2019s left a few runs out there; even so, the certainty of his strokeplay is a good sign for the summer ahead. 16th over: Australia 107-2 (Smith 40, Inglis 38) Shaheen Shah Afridi returns after the drinks break. He goes around the wicket to Inglis, who wallops a drive that is well stopped at extra cover. Two from the over; Shaheen has been the pick of the Pakistan bowlers. Drinks Australia need 99 from 35 overs, and they might just do it. 15th over: Australia 105-2 (Smith 39, Inglis 37) Inglis edges straight between the keeper and a widish slip for four. An affronted Haris Rauf spears the next ball down the leg side for five wides. This is getting away from Pakistan in a hurry; in the commentary box attention has turned to whether Josh Inglis will/should open the batting in the Test series against India. Nathan McSweeney is in pole position but you can understand the excitement around Inglis. I would probably keep him as the next middle-order cab off the rank; asking him to learn a new position against Jasprit Bumrah feels more than a little risky. 14th over: Australia 93-2 (Smith 37, Inglis 32) Smith pays tribute to that Inglis with an almost identical boundary off Hasnain, whose fourth over disappears for 15. Inglis hooks very fine for six before cuffing a short ball disdainfully over midwicket for four. After a slightly awkward start against Naseem Shah, Inglis is flying: 10 from the first 19 balls, 22 from the next 8. 13th over: Australia 78-2 (Smith 32, Inglis 22) Haris Rauf replaces Naseem Shah, who bowled more menacingly than figures of 5-0-35-1 might suggest. After Smith edges a good ball wide of slip for a single, Inglis threads a superb drive between extra cover and mid off for four. He attacks with such authority. 12th over: Australia 72-2 (Smith 31, Inglis 17) The box seat is never entirely comfortable against Pakistan, whose fast bowlers can run amok at a moment\u2019s notice, but right now Australia look in control of this chase. Smith turns Hasnain behind square for a couple to move into the thirties. 11th over: Australia 68-2 (Smith 28, Inglis 16) Naseem continues hunting for wickets; there\u2019s no point saving his overs because the game will be done if Pakistan don\u2019t get a couple more very quickly. Inglis pushes at another sharp lifter and then thinks better of it; that probably still does down as a play and miss. Inglis, tired of being a bit of a punchbag, fetches a short ball from outside off stump and over midwicket for a big six. Shot! 10th over: Australia 61-2 (Smith 27, Inglis 10) When Steve Smith\u2019s hands and eyes are perfectly in sync, bowling to him feels like the definition of futility. Saying which, he almost runs himself out with a very tight single to mid-on; it would have been Spandex-tight with a direct hit. \u201cShout out to my son Josh, who\u2019s at the game,\u201d says Rob Lewis. He\u2019s been living Down Under for two years, and he still clings on to his support for England. I hope and pray it continues!\u201d Next year\u2019s Ashes just got even bigger! 9th over: Australia 59-2 (Smith 26, Inglis 9) Inglis is dropped off Naseem Shah, who has changed ends to replace Shaheen. He was startled by a brutish lifter and could only fence the ball towards gully, where Irfan Khan dived high to his right and tipped it over the bar. Batting looks pretty tricky out there \u2013 except for Steve Smith, who lashes another majestic boundary through point. He has 26 from 21 balls. 8th over: Australia 54-2 (Smith 22, Inglis 8) Steve Smith is the perfect man, and I say this with love, to suck the jeopardy out of the run-chase. He drives the new bowler Mohammad Hasnain beautifully down the ground for four, just to the right of the stumps at the non-striker\u2019s end, and is starting to look a bit ominous for Pakistan. An emphatic pull for four more takes him to 22 from 18 balls. 7th over: Australia 45-2 (Smith 14, Inglis 7) Shaheen continues to swing the ball back into the right-handers; nothing lavish but enough to make the batters wary of anything straight. Just three runs from the over. 6th over: Australia 42-2 (Smith 12, Inglis 6) Josh Inglis was in great form in the Sheffield Shield, making centuries in both games last month. After missing one attempted cut off Naseem, he nails the stroke past cover point for four. It\u2019s high-octane stuff out there. Australia are still strong favourites but Pakistan are aggressively protecting an under-par score as only they can. 5th over: Australia 36-2 (Smith 12, Inglis 1) Pakistan are on one. Smith is hit on the glove by a nasty lifter from Shaheen, who then has an LBW appeal turned down when Smith plays across a good delivery. It was too high and would have missed off, but it will enhance Pakistan\u2019s belief that something is happening. Smith does not share that view and moves into double figures with a smooth pull round the corner for four. 4th over: Australia 28-2 (Smith 5, Inglis 0) That was the last ball of the over. Fraser-McGurk cloths Naseem Shah straight to mid-on. He\u2019s been teasing the fielders, mistiming shots all over the place, but this time he picked out Irfan Khan. Fraser-McGurk goes for 16 from 14 balls; while he\u2019s the definition of box office, you can argue that that was a pretty ugly innings, unbecoming of somebody with his talent. He basically tried to hit every ball for four or six. 3rd over: Australia 21-1 (Fraser-McGurk 13, Smith 2) Steve Smith gets off the mark with a confident hook for two. Pakistan are hunting wickets, knowing that\u2019s the only way they can win this game. An early breakthrough for Pakistan. Short tries to pull Afridi, a shot that is usually so profitable, but the ball is angled across and he top-edges it towards third man. Three men converge and Saim Ayub, running back from inside the circle, takes a terrific catch over his shoulder. 2nd over: Australia 18-0 (Short 1, Fraser-McGurk 12) Strap in, folks, Jake Fraser-McGurk is batting. He drives Naseem Shah\u2019s first ball high over mid-off, but doesn\u2019t time it properly and almost gives a catch to Babar Azam. Babar charged desperately towards the boundary and couldn\u2019t quite get there. An extravagant chip over mid-off teases the fielder before landing safely for a couple more runs, then Fraser-McGurk launches an emphatic first boundary over wide mid-on. Four leg-byes and a quick single complete a very profitable over, 14 from it. 1st over: Australia 4-0 (Short 1, Fraser-McGurk 3) There\u2019s some early inswing to the right-handers for Shaheen, but he\u2019s a bit too straight and that allows both openers to get off the mark with clips to leg. A quiet start. The players are back on the field. Shaheen Shah Afridi is about to open the bowling to Matt Short and Jake Fraser-McGurk, and I would suggest a maiden over is unlikely. Thanks Angus, afternoon everyone. We should probably have expected this. Pakistan have a wretched recent ODI record both against and in Australia: they\u2019ve won only 8 of the last 40 games between the sides. And it\u2019s likely to become 8 from 41 despite the infectious defiance of Naseem Shah, who smashed four sixes from No9 to take Pakistan past 200. Even so, the last time Australia failed to chase a target of 204 or less at home* was against New Zealand in January 2002, when Steve Waugh was starting his last month as white-ball captain, Mulholland Drive was scaring the bejesus out of cinemaphiles and a love was burning inside Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. It was a lifetime ago. * Barring a DLS game in 2007 when they were chasing 186 from 27 overs, which doesn\u2019t count. The visitors did well to smash, grab and scamper their way to 200 in the end but this first ODI is still very much Australia\u2019s game to lose. Their bowlers were relentless, with Mitchell Starc the pick, finishing with 3-33. Pat Cummins chimed in with 2-39 and Adam Zampa returned 2-69, including the key wicket of Babar Azam, a victory soured somewhat by the late stick he copped from No 8 Naseem Shah who whacked a valuable 40 from 39 balls. Pakistan\u2019s top order crumpled like a cheap suit and it was left to their middle order and tail to salvage some pride. But will 203 runs be enough against an Australian wrecking crew featuring Glenn Maxwell and Jake Fraser-McGurk? Join Rob Smyth after the dinner break to find out. Cummins finishes it! Pakistan had fought hard to get to 200 thanks to Naseem\u2019s fireworks but they flopped over the line with nothing left. After all that masterful blasting it\u2019s a slower ball that undoes Naseem. He misjudges the drive and pops a simple catch to Starc at midoff to finish the Pakistan innings. 46th over: Pakistan 203-9 (Naseem 40, Hasnain 1) Zampa comes back to deliver the coup de grace. Or does he? Naseem won\u2019t go down with a whimper. He takes a single from the first and exposes No 11 Hasnain. But the bunny gets a runny and WHAM! Naseem plunders Zampa\u2019 next ball, sending it over the long on fence. SIX! Fifth ball is wider and has more fizz on it but Naseem doesn\u2019t care. He dances out of his crease again and and lofts it over cover for FOUR. Nice batting Naseem. And what a way to finish the over as Naseem swings through the line and sends it dead straight for another SIX! 45th over: Pakistan 184-9 (Naseem 23, Hasnain 0) Glenn Maxwell whirls through an over and Naseem picks off a single. Can Pakistan make 200? 44th over: Pakistan 183-9 (Naseem 23, Hasnain 0) Big appeal by Australia. Zampa shot it through quick on new batter, No 11 Mohammad Hasnain, who pushed forward and missed. It\u2019s a good shout but umpire says no. Cummins disagrees and opts to review. Yes it\u2019s inline but original decision will stand. RIP Mister Rauf! That was foolhardy stuff with six overs left to bat. Instead the youngster tried to whip a straight ball zooter through midwicket and missed. 43rd over: Pakistan 182-8 (Naseem 14, Rauf 0) Maxwell is taken downtown! That\u2019s a lovely six from Naseem who skipped down and merrily plonked it a few rows into the grandstand down the ground. Haris Rauf is the new batter. He has 65 runs from his 15 ODIs for Pakistan but at least they\u2019ve come at a strike-rate of 85.55. Terrible mix-up from the Pakistan batters and Irfan is gone. He played a smart reverse swat to Maxwell\u2019s first delivery and it looked an easy single but the youngster hesitated for a second and slipped. The Matt Short throw to Maxwell was quick and flat \u2013 too quick for Irfan. Out! 42nd over: Pakistan 175-7 (Irfan 22, Naseem 14) Despite being off the pace all day, Pakistan have scrambled themselves within sight of 200. If they can get there, or beyond, who knows? They have a long tail for batting but that means it carries a sting when it comes to bowling. Will the absence of big hitters Travis Head and Mitchell Marsh \u2013 both of whom are on paternity leave \u2013 come back to haunt Australia in their run chase? Abbott puts the clamps on in his eighth over \u2013 just three singles from it 41st over: Pakistan 172-7 (Irfan 20, Naseem 13) As Pat Cummins rolls in for his ninth over and Paistan\u2019s plucy tailenders hang in there with some stubborn resistance, Simon Chance gets in touch via email to mourn the dearth of coverage on free-to-air television for this series which runs solely on Foxtel and Kayo: Hi Angus, what a pity CA have gone behind the paywall with one day international cricket mens games played in Australia. There cannot be a swifter way to kill interest in the game \u2013 as the Rah Rah Rugby Union boys have found out. If they can\u2019t be bothered making it available on free to air then I cannot be bothered with it at all. 40th over: Pakistan 169-7 (Irfan 18, Naseem 12) Sean Abbott\u2019s first ball in his seventh over is a no-ball and it gifts Naseem a free hit. What can he do with it? Abbott angrily hurls it down short but it\u2019s a slower ball and Naseem has the rhythm to meet it on the up. SIX! Lovely shot by the youngster \u2013 that\u2019s gone 85-metres on the fly over midwicket. That\u2019s his first six for Pakistan in one-day internationals and it\u2019s a beauty. 39th over: Pakistan 159-7 (Irfan 17, Naseem 5) Pat Cummins is back into the attack for an eighth over. Irfan wafts at the second ball and almost edges. There\u2019s more timber on the third and he gets a single square of the wicket. Naseem gets one as well, fending to gully. Cumminss tries to dig the final ball in short but Irfan picks the gauntlet up and return it with interest, slapping a stabbing pull over midwicket for a boundary. 38th over: Pakistan 153-7 (Irfan 11, Naseem 3) Naseem Shah is the new batter and he sees out the Starc over to leave the big quick with the excellent figures of 3-33 from 10 overs. Now Zampa has the new batter on strike but Naseem is equal to the task. he takes two and then a single to hang onto strike. Stumps akimbo! Having blasted 24 from 19 balls, Shaheen wanted another boundary and Starc was savvy to the threat. The Australian went full and straight, swung it slightly across the line and it went through Shaheen like a dose of salts, sending the timber flying. That\u2019s three wickets for Mitchell Starc today. 37th over: Pakistan 148-6 (Shaheen 20, Irfan 11) Mitchell Starc enter his final over\u2026. and Shaheen shows him the exit, lifting it over mid-off for another FOUR. Good batting by the Pakistan veteran. How will Starc repond? 36th over: Pakistan 144-6 (Shaheen 20, Irfan 11) That one is up\u2026 and OVER! Zampa tossed it up to Shaheen Shah Afridi skipped out and took him downtown for SIX! And the veteran No 8 does it again to the fifth delivery, moving his feet and giving it a big whack to the rope for FOUR. Good over for Pakistan \u2013 10 runs from it. 35th over: Pakistan 130-6 (Shaheen 7, Irfan 10) Australia want a quick finish. They have brought back Starc for a final blast. Shaheen takes a quick single from the first but balls two and three are wide. Irfan connec ts handsomely with the fifth which was full and straight and right in the batter\u2019s slot. He sweep it sweetly backward of square. 34th over: Pakistan 128-6 (Shaheen 6, Irfan 9) Zampa is back\u2026 and after four neat balls Zampa is GONE! as Irfan sweeps cleanly to the fine leg boundary. 33rd over: Pakistan 124-6 (Shaheen 6, Irfan 5) Ah, the ignominy of falling to Marnus. Rizwan had 44 and was within one shot of a half-century. But he blundered into Cummins\u2019 trap and tried to double-dip on the mercurial part-time spinner. Normal service has resumed now as Hardie works through his fopurth over. And WHACK! goes new batter Shaheen Shah Afridi who bullets a lofted drive over Hardie\u2019s head and over the fence! Marnus magic at the MCG! Having rolled the dice and bowled a couple of wildcards in Matt Short and Glenn Maxwell Cummins looked to have regained his senses by turning to Aaron Hardie. Instead he flipped out the ultimate Joker and it\u2019s worked! Rizwa\u2019s eyes lit up at Australia\u2019s No 3 batter coming on to bowl and carted him for four. But Labuschagne had the last laugh one ball later. Rizwan leapt out to sweep it again and only succeeded in getting a top edge and Inglis took a great running catch. Pakistan\u2019s captain is gone! 31st over: Pakistan 116-5 (Rizwan 40, Irfan 3) Aaron Hardie gets another over after his brief spell this morning. Rizwan slaps him over mid-on for four. That\u2019s more like it! 30th over: Pakistan 108-5 (Rizwan 36, Irfan 3) Having bowled Matt Short for an over, Cummin has played another wildcard. It will be Glenn Maxwell into the attack. Heavily bearded and bristling with energy, the lithe allrounder flings down a mixed bag but makes the batters use their feet. The Big Show gets worked for a couple of Small Singles to long on but that\u2019s it. 29th over: Pakistan 105-5 (Rizwan 34, Irfan 2) With the arrival of Khan, Pakistan are into their long tail. Abbott can smell bunnies on the breeze and tightens his line after a couple of hasty yet risky singles from each batter. There\u2019s a half cry on the final delivery. Has he snicked it? Australia seemed confident but Cummins shot a review down fast. Good decision by Captain pat (and the umpire) as Snicko shows nothing but air. 28th over: Pakistan 103-5 (Rizwan 32, Irfan 1 ) As reward for his sharp catch in the last over Matt Short has been given a bowl. He whips through four fizzing deliveries before Rizwan works a single. New batter Irfan Khan gets off the mark from the last ball. Partnership broken! Pakistan were trying to turbo boost the innings and Abbott sensed the moment and threw in an effort ball. It fell short, exploded off the pitch and rushed at Salman\u2019s salivating lips. He swiped at it but didn\u2019t get much timber on it and it chipped up for Matt Short at midwicket. Australia strike for the fifth time. 27th over: Pakistan 101-4 (Rizwan 32, Salman 12) Abbott draws a massive top edge from Rizwan and it\u2019s up, up, up\u2026 but safe! That was luck for Pakistan. Wicketkeeper Inglis and the boundary rider Starc hesitated just enough to let the ball drop between them. Pakistan are upping the ante now but it\u2019s high risk cricket. 26th over: Pakistan 96-4 (Rizwan 29, Salman 11) That was an awesome shot by Rizwan off Starc, leaning back to a fast ball and smashing it over the fence. Rizwan has now got himself to 28 at a strike-rate a tick over 50. Not great but Pakistan will take it. He knows Pakistan are halfway through their overs and only a third of the way to a competitive score. Now Salman gets the signal, swatting Adam Zampa behind square for a boundary. Good batting Pakistan! 25th over: Pakistan 90-4 (Rizwan 28, Salman 6) The pickle has worked its magic! Mitchell Starc is back on the field and running in for his eighth over. The crowd are still coming in here at the MCG \u2013 tough to judge numbers in so cavernous a stadium but looks a healthy crowd with clumps of support for both sides. Rizwan takes a single through square leg but Rizwan does better \u2013 much better! \u2013 swiping the final ball for SIX! 24th over: Pakistan 81-4 (Rizwan 21, Salman 4) As Starc takes a slug of pickle pinot gris, Zampa looks fresh as a daisy, flipping and fizzing them at an increasingly befuddled Pakistan. Salman fends off the first three then panics, chipping it to mid-on and attempting a run. He gets halfway down the pitch before Rizwan declines his offer and sends him back. Finally Salman gets his single and Rizwan does too from the last. 23rd over: Pakistan 76-4 (Rizwan 19, Salman 1) Australia are going for the throat \u2013 or is that the soft belly of the middle order? They bring back Starc and he delivers a maiden. Although he\u2019s pulled up sore and is now jogging off the field. Hopefully a cramp and not a more serious injury. Will they call for the pickle juice? It\u2019s worked for him before\u2026 22nd over: Pakistan 76-4 (Rizwan 19, Salman 1) Zampa\u2019s threat is such that Rizwan knows he\u2019s got to attack or perish. He slog sweeps two and gets away with it, then sneaks a single. Salman follows suit and Pakistan have four runs from the over. That\u2019s better for the visitors nearing the halfway point of this innings. 21st over: Pakistan 72-4 (Rizwan 16, Salman 0) Cummins turns the screws on Pakistan. Rizwan scampers a single but Salman can\u2019t find a run for the rest of the over. The Australian skipper has 28-1 from his seven overs so far, with one miserly maiden. 20th over: Pakistan 70-4 (Rizwan 15, Salman 0) Zampa bowls a masterly maiden to the new batter Salman Agha. 19th over: Pakistan 70-4 (Rizwan 11, Salman 0) That was superb bowling by Cummins and after lulling Pakistan into confidence by giving them three easy singles, he pulled out a grenade on the last and got his team a wicket with a perfectly-directed bouncer. Cummins strikes! This time it\u2019s the new batter Kamran Ghulam who has 11 brothers and six sisters and came out batting like a man who fought for everything he\u2019s got. But he was too boisterous, and Cummins pushed him onto the back foot with a bouncer and Ghulam flinched and fended, succeeding only in gloving it to Inglis. Pakistan in trouble! 18th over: Pakistan 67-3 (Rizwan 11, Kamran 4) The lethal leggie enters this game with 177 wickets from his 103 ODIs and he struck with his first over. Great bowling by Zampa and smart captaincy by Cummins to bring him in with the game in the balance. New batter is Kamran Ghulam and he dances down the wicket to his second delivery and spiflicates Zampa down the ground past mid-off for a sweet boundary. Come in spinner! Adam Zampa strikes with the fourth ball of his first over! Having puffed and primped his blonde mullet to perfection, Zampa deceives the dangerman Babar who thought he was getting a conventional leg spinner and instead got a flipper. It skidded straight through his defences and snuck under the bat to take his off-stump. 17th over: Pakistan 62-2 (Rizwan 11, Babar 37) Pat Cummins has had a drink and, feeling revived, returned himself to the attack. Rizwan drives the first ball unconvincingly down the ground and gets a single. Babar fends the second delivery into slips but can\u2019t split them. He goes squarer to the fourth Cummins ball and does better, running an easy single. Cummins sprays a full toss at him and Rizwan is too shocked to punish it. Instead he works the final ball through a now-vacant cordon for a single to keep strike. 16th over: Pakistan 59-2 (Rizwan 9, Babar 36) Abbott enters his fourth over in his 25th ODI for Australia. Since debuting for New South Wales at the age of 18 and winning the Steve Waugh Medal as NSW player of the season with 27 wickets, Abbott has struggled a to reach his potential. Babar knows it too. Having watched Abbott fumble a couple of balls in the outfield, he applies even more pressure on the 32-year-old with a thumping square cut over backward point. That\u2019s a much-needed boundary for Pakistan. 15th over: Pakistan 51-2 (Rizwan 7, Babar 31) Hardie has started well here, zeroing in on a nagging length and hitting it consistently. He leaks two singles but Australia remain on top at the MCG. 14th over: Pakistan 49-2 (Rizwan 6, Babar 30) Babar is leading the Pakistan comeback after the loss of those two early wickets. But the going is tough. Australia have bowled tight lines and Rizwan, normally a dasher, has only five from 20 and is still struggling to find his touch. They eke a single from the final ball of Abbott\u2019s third over but the run rate is running at a trickle and stands at just over three-per-over. 13th over: Pakistan 47-2 (Rizwan 5, Babar 29) Starc is off and Aaron Hardie is on for Australia. Hardie is a big man, standing over 190cm and as broad as he is tall. Bowls a good wobble seam does Hardie. He beats Babar with it on his second delivery but Babar hits back with the next ball, flicking Hardie off the pads for a fast-run two. Hardie was born in the UK but grew up in Western Australia and has clearly adopted the diet preferred by Cameron Green and Mitchell Marsh. This is the big unit\u2019s ninth ODI for his country and his first over today is a good one, just two from it. 12th over: Pakistan 45-2 (Rizwan 5, Babar 27) Sean Abbott is into his second over after leaking three runs from his first. Big appeal to the second delivery! Did it catch the edge? Abbott seems confident but Australia\u2019s close fielders think not and there\u2019s no review. Abbott is into the mid-130kph range but Babar works him through deep square for a single to retain strike. 11th over: Pakistan 43-2 (Rizwan 4, Babar 26) Starc is back for another and Rizwan then Babar takes him for singles. They do it again from the next two deliveries. Finally, having done it in singles from fopur hots, Babar achieves the same dividend with a single shot, pulling a short ball through midwicket. Beautiful shot! 10th over: Pakistan 35-2 (Rizwan 2, Babar 20) Here\u2019s the bowling change we forecast: Sean Abbott replaces Pat Cummins and he\u2019s bowling to Rizwan who is still on zero. And it\u2019s almost a runout! The ball was full outside off, drives to cover and Babar took off despite the fielder being Marnus Labuschagne. He lunges and loops the ball at the stumps but misses as Rizwan dives. A direct hit would have had him there. Finally Rizwan gets off the mark with a weird slice that squeaks into covers for two. 9th over: Pakistan 32-2 (Rizwan 0, Babar 19) Starc is into his fifth over now. His pace is rising and he has two wickets in his kitbag so the big man\u2019s superb record against Pakistan is continuing today. He has new batter Rizwan on strike and thumps it into his gloves. Starc puts the next one wide. He knows Rizwan hasn\u2019t scored from seven balls so far and is trying to tempt a wild slash. No dice this time but it\u2019s another Starc maiden. 8th over: Pakistan 32-2 (Rizwan 0, Babar 19) Babar cracks Cummins for four! Great shot by Pakistan\u2019s 117-ODI veteran. Captain Pat might have to consider taking a breather here. He went for 10 off his last over and now he\u2019s been spanked through midwicket with vim. Pat gets his radar right on the next few but goes short and straight on the final throw of the dice and Babar steps out to smack it down the ground. Another four! 7th over: Pakistan 24-2 (Rizwan 0, Babar 11) Starc\u2019s first ball is full but a tad wide of off stump and Abdullah meets it on the up, driving handsomely. Abbott manages to collar that one but Pakistan steal another two runs. Starc\u2019s wicket with his fourth ball has brought Mohammad Rizwan to the crease and he sees off the final two deliveries. Short and sweet from Starc! He pitched it up at Shafique who had battled to 12 from 26 balls. The batter tried to get out of the ball\u2019s path but dropped his hands too late and it clipped the top edge on the way through and Inglis pouched an easy chance. 6th over: Pakistan 22-1 (Abdullah 10, Babar 11) Another misfield from Abbott! Babar drove Cummins into the offside and Abbott slid to meet it on the bounce but lost sight of it somehow and Babar ran two when he should\u2019ve been reduced to a single. Now Babar slides one to fine leg for a single. Now Cummin s drops short to Abdullah Shafique and BANG! He rocks back and bashes it down the ground for Pakistan\u2019s first boundary of the day. Grteat counter attack from Pakistan. And now they show finesse, Abdullah clipping off his ankles to steal another two runs through midwicket. A single from the last gives Pakiustan a 10-run over and Pat Cummins plenty of food for thought. 5th over: Pakistan 12-1 (Abdullah 3, Babar 8) Babar lashes at that one! Great statement of intent from the Pakistani pulveriser. Only a finger flung to the right prevented a boundary on that occasion. He gets two runs from Starc. And now Abdullah runs a fast \u2013 and risky \u2013 single. For once, Cummins is imperfect, a wild throw negating any chance of a runout. Babar is back from a couple of weeks off. He\u2019s been playing golf and, judging from that first shot of the over, has brought his long irons to the MCG today. He drives at Starc\u2019s final delivery and draws a misfield from Sean Abbott. Three runs. 4th over: Pakistan 5-1 (Abdullah 2, Babar 2) Here is Cummins, bustling to the crease. Babar Azam came to the middle after the loss of Ayub and immediately spanked neat two from Starc to draw even with Abdullah. The Pakistan batters can\u2019t do better in this over, with Cummins bang on target straight away. It\u2019s a maiden. Starc strikes. That ball was fuller and faster and Ayub pushed forward and got a thick and ugly inside edge into the stumps.First blood to the home side! It was a tentative shot from the young opener, normally an attacking batter, but nerves got the better of him on that occasion and Australia have their first scalp of the match. 3rd over: Pakistan 3-0 (Ayub 1, Shafique 2) Starc returns. His first over tickled the speed gun at 136kph but there\u2019s a deeper bend to the back this over. Ayub leaves the first few alone, keen to build a big innings and see off the Australian assassin\u2026 2nd over: Pakistan 3-0 (Ayub 1, Shafique 2) Saim Ayub now has the strike to Australia\u2019s captain Pat Cummins and he gets some bat on the first delivery, not much but enough to run a single. Pakistan are off the mark and so is Ayub. Now Shafique gets off his duck with a strong punch through point. Glenn Maxwell retrieves it in the outfield. Now Cummins the conjuror appears! His fourth ball is a beauty, just back of a length and it whizzes past the edge of Shafique\u2019s flailing blade. Good comeback by the skipper. 1st over: Pakistan 0-0 (Saim 0, Shafique 0) Abdullah Shafique has survives the first couple of deliveries and already Starc has extracted a slight hint of swing back into the right-handed batter. Third ball is a fat full-pitched yorker on the offside and Shafique has a swish at it but is beaten for pace. He can\u2019t get near the fifth and dead bats the final delivery. A maiden to get us started Mitchell Starc has the new ball and we are about to get under way with the first ball of the Australian international summer\u2026 Wurundjeri elder Aunty Joy Murphy Wandin is delivering a gentle and generous Welcome to Country to the teams and a small but vibrant MCG crowd. Melbourne is smack bang in the middle of its Spring racing carnival and many locals have taken today off work for the Melbourne Cup, \u201cthe race that stops a nation\u201d. Famously, American author Mark Twain, attended the Cup in 1895, and wrote: \u201cThe grandstands make a brilliant and wonderful spectacle, a delirium of colour, a vision of beauty. The champagne flows, everybody is vivacious, excited, happy.\u201d \u2022 This post was amended on 13 November 2024. Aunty Joy Murphy Wandin is a Wurundjeri elder, not a Wiradjuri elder as an earlier version said. That means we\u2019ll have to wait for the fireworks from young master Fraser-McGurk and we\u2019ll have to content ourselves with the greatest fast bowling cartel in the cricket world. Players are taking the field at the MCG and we\u2019ll have the first ball soon. Pakistan have long been an unpredictable cricket team and few predicted their Test series win over England last month. Having run up a first innings total in excess of 500, they looked primed for victory yet spectacularly capitulated to lose the first Test by an innings. Yet, under the calm resolute leadership of Gillespie, they fought back to win the next two Tests. Here\u2019s how James Wallace made sense of such madness\u2026 Regardless of who wins the toss, many cricket fans will be hoping to see Australia\u2019s 22-year-old batting superstar Jake Fraser-McGurk unleashed. Despite being the new coach of Pakistan, Jason Gillespie is a beloved figure in Australian cricket. The great-grandson of a Kamilaroi warrior, \u201cDizzy\u201d is recognised as our first male Indigenous Test cricketer. Sydney-born and Adelaide-raised, Gillespie\u2019s celebrated 71-Test career produced 259 wickets plus another 142 scalps from his 97 ODIs. With his glorious mullet, magnificent moustache and a fast-bowler\u2019s sneer that could curdle a batter\u2019s bone marrow at 10 paces, he was a dream to watch and a nightmare to face. Curiously, Gillespie\u2019s most famous moment came with the bat: his maiden Test century was a scarcely-believable unbeaten 201 in Bangladesh \u2013 the highest score in history by a nightwatchman and an innings compiled over 574 minutes and 425 balls. Mohammad Hasnain might be familiar to a few Australians. The beanpole quick with the lightning right-arm was first sighted on these shores in 2019 when he made his ODI debut as an 18-year-old. Back then he was regularly nudging the speed gun at 150kph but injuries have derailed his career and cut into that express speed. Five years later he makes a welcome return as a 24-year-old for a 10th white-ball match for Pakistan. Hasnain looked pretty good in MCG nets on Saturday as he rolled in under the watchful eye of Pakistan\u2019s new Australian coach, Jason Gillespie\u2026 Greetings cricket fans! Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the first men\u2019s one-day international between Australia and Pakistan. This is game one of a three-match series and today\u2019s action is coming to you from the Melbourne Cricket Ground. I\u2019m Angus Fontaine and I\u2019ll be steering you through the first fusillades of action. Although these countries met in January for a Test series won by Australia 3-0, it\u2019s been more than a year since they last crossed swords in the ODI format. That clash was at the 2023 World Cup clash in Bengaluru and Australia won by a 62-runs after a memorably mammoth opening stand of 259-runs between David Warner and Mitchell Marsh. Much to Pakistan\u2019s relief, neither of those veterans will be in the Australian squad today. Warner has retired at last and Marsh is on ice (ie. paternity leave) for the upcoming Test series against India where he will have to shoulder the bowling load of the injured Cameron Green. With master blaster Travis Head also enjoying the flush of fatherhood, it will be Matt Short and Jake Fraser-McGurk opening for the men in gold. Pat Cummins returns as captain for Australia for this series and leads a formidable XI of Matt Short, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Steve Smith, Josh Inglis, Marnus Labuschagne, Aaron Hardie, Glenn Maxwell, Sean Abbott, Mitchell Starc and Adam Zampa. Pakistan are fresh from a stirring Test series victory over England in England and have a new white-ball captain in Mohammad Rizwan, the 32-year-old from Peshawar in his 73rd ODI for Pakistan. They also have some new blood in their matchday XI with batter Muhammad Irfan Khan to debut and Kamran Ghulam to play his second ODI. Their four-man pace attack shapes as Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah, Haris Rauf and the two-metre tall Mohammad Hasnain, who has been clocked at 155.1 kph! Australia is experiencing a late-Spring heatwave so we have a warm, cloudy day in Melbourne and a clear forecast for this evening\u2019s day-nighter. Play gets under way at 2.30pm AEST and you\u2019re free to shoot me on email at any stage with interesting stats and stories, words of encouragement or clarifications for any errors as I clatter away. Until then batten \u2018em down and buckle \u2018em up because the action isn\u2019t far away.",

      "body": "<h2>Verdi: Falstaff - Finale</h2> <p>Apologies to Mozartians, who might claim that The Marriage of Figaro has the most uplifting finale in the operatic repertory, but <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/5ccOMuqoTnTq8IFCYvOWlP?si=wJcBC6GVTbefI_LDYexpHQ&amp;context=spotify%3Aalbum%3A0pZxQEh1zqzOCqS6WKkeD1\">the final fugue in Verdi\u2019s last opera</a> wins the prize. It\u2019s not just the idea of ending a score already larded with parodies and allusions with the most academic of musical forms, or its astounding compositional virtuosity \u2013 10 independent voices at one point \u2013 but its irresistible outpouring of joyous energy. \u201cTutto nel mondo \u00e8 burla\u201d (<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/opera-north/act-iii-fugue\">Life is a burst of laughter</a>) indeed. <strong>Andrew Clements</strong></p> <h2>Stravinsky: Petrushka</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/48b9TuT9NLkm8oYiAdAcKn?si=b84924771ff345a6\">  <iframe height=\"152\" width=\"456\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/48b9TuT9NLkm8oYiAdAcKn?utm_source=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>  <p>Stravinsky wrote three game-changing ballets early in his career and I could have chosen any of them, but the opening of Petrushka gets the heart racing like nothing else. It\u2019s an almost cinematic follow-shot, as Stravinsky whirls us through the crowded fair where the story takes place in an exhilarating sequence of clashing tempos and keys and textures \u2013 music that picks you up without warning, whirls you round before you can catch your breath, and drops you back down again facing something new. <strong>Erica Jeal</strong></p> <h2>John Adams: Short Ride in a Fast Machine</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LoUm_r7It8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5LoUm_r7It8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s the woodblock that does it: setting a pace that instantly raises your heart rate. Trumpets add their gleam to the pulse. Woodwind and synths bubble in maximalist splashes of colour. The strings launch a rhythmic lick that drives against the original beat. The texture becomes denser, its gears changing constantly. Every shift brings another injection of brash, joyous energy. John Adams\u2019 1986 orchestral fanfare is four minutes of classical thrill-seeking \u2013 a shot of adrenaline for tired ears. <strong>Flora Willson</strong></p> <h2>Bernstein: Candide Overture</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn5bhJ5YX6U\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zn5bhJ5YX6U?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Explosive, restless, with brassy outbursts, taut rhythms and soaring tunes, the overture to Bernstein\u2019s Voltaire-based operetta is a short, dazzling punch of energy.

Listen. Sit still if you can. You won\u2019t. <strong>Fiona Maddocks</strong></p> <h2>Ravel: Gaspard de la Nuit</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/5DiCgO6trcxIMjIP8mrUNS?si=t1XvpFMtTEyULL2Rm4eIOQ\">  <iframe height=\"352\" width=\"456\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/5DiCgO6trcxIMjIP8mrUNS?utm_source=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>  <p>Quiet music is not synonymous with relaxing music. Maurice Ravel\u2019s three movement 1908 piano suite exemplifies this. In Ravel\u2019s hands, quiet is tense, expectant, even menacing. Each piece in Gaspard begins quietly but is packed with suspense. Ondine ripples like the water into which the nymph drags her victims. In Le Gibet, ghostly phrases circle a continuously tolling B flat, as a body sways on the gallows. And in Scarbo, quiet tremolos explode into terrifying darkness. There is not a bar in Ravel\u2019s score that does not ask: what comes next? You don\u2019t dare relax for a second. <strong>Martin Kettle</strong></p> <h2>Strauss: Elektra</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/6sL7ArNAaZelHIwfDSl1Mt?si=JLn4rRC9TJiJnFaqiqGoTw\">  <iframe height=\"352\" width=\"456\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6sL7ArNAaZelHIwfDSl1Mt?utm_source=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>  <p>Opera\u2019s ability to probe, often unflinchingly, human emotion at its most complex and profound has long made it the musical form I love the most.

A tremendous, shattering work, to which I always return, again and again. <strong>Tim Ashley</strong></p> <h2>Brahms: Piano Concerto No 1, Op.15</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/0UnYwv2jCX2VUJgG3LeJAK?si=_WeLhsMbQKy6Zo7DsxSX4A\">  <iframe height=\"352\" width=\"456\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0UnYwv2jCX2VUJgG3LeJAK?utm_source=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>  <p>As one who has a real aversion to the promotion of classical music as an unwinding fix, my recommendation is a work which is stimulating and endlessly engaging: Brahms\u2019s First Piano Concerto. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/jan/06/brahms-piano-concertos-stephen-hough\">Stephen Hough has described its opening as \u201ca clap of D minor thunder\u201d</a> and its stormy emotional charge is guaranteed to send the brain neurons into instant action potential signalling.

I too was 16 when I first encountered it \u2013 dragged along to a classical concert by my father \u2013 and I was transfixed by its sparkle and optimism and the sheer joy it brought to the musicians performing that evening.

Everyone should know,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Lopez said that she is even more determined to keep Trump out of the White House but is concerned that people around her will not turn out to vote because they don\u2019t understand the threat.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bf30d5e8-4209-4d30-91e8-82f6a9e72604\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In what is expected to be a knife-edge US election decided by a few voters in a handful of key battleground states, the Guardian is exploring Saginaw, Michigan. It is a swing area in a swing state whose voters will bear an outsize influence on the outcome of the fight between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Chris McGreal is on the ground in Saginaw in the run up to November's election examining the issues that voters of all political backgrounds care about.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/26/saginaw-michigan-voters-presidential-election-trump-harris-share\"><b>Saginaw voters: tell us which issues will decide the US election</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not only worried, I know for a fact that people aren\u2019t voting. I have two daughters that have never voted. I am going to do everything I possibly can to convince them that this year of all years, I\u2019m going to ask them to do it for me, just to do it for me, because that\u2019s two votes right there,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>In another part of Saginaw, Black community leaders were sounding similar warnings at a meeting in a church amid simmering fears that ambivalent and disenchanted voters will stay home in a key county in a battleground state.</p> \n<p>Barack Obama won Saginaw county twice. Donald Trump then beat Hillary Clinton by a little more than 1,000 votes in 2016. Four years later, Joe Biden took the county by an even narrower margin of just 303 votes.</p> \n<p>But in that election, Trump\u2019s votes went up. He only lost because Democrats who stayed home in 2016 turned out in large numbers to remove Trump from the White House four years later. Kamala Harris may well need the same kind of turnout this year to win.</p> \n<p>The Harris campaign sees reasons for optimism. The vice-president\u2019s entry into the race injected a new enthusiasm among some younger voters in Saginaw. The supreme court\u2019s quashing of abortion rights continues to anger many female voters. Then there is the fear factor: there is no shortage of Americans scared for the future of their democracy if Trump returns to the Oval Office.</p> \n<p>But will it be enough to push Harris across the line in Saginaw county? Some minority community leaders fear not.</p> \n<p>There is a general recognition that Harris has run a much better ground game than Clinton did eight years ago when she was so confident of winning that she barely bothered to turn up in Michigan and then lost the state. But there is concern that Harris has played it too safe on policies, which has reinforced a sense that she will change little if elected, and is too reliant on Trump to undermine his own campaign or scare people into voting against him.</p> \n<p>Campaigners are focussed on minority communities in Saginaw because they have traditionally had a lower turnout than more prosperous parts of the county with large white populations, which provide Trump with most of his votes. For that reason, some Harris supporters believe areas such as inner Saginaw city have the greatest potential to find extra votes.</p> \n<p>Rosa Morales thought the Democrats weren\u2019t paying enough attention to Latino voters in Saginaw, where she was born and lives.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhere are the resources? It\u2019s like they take us for granted. I\u2019m worried, it\u2019s so narrow,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard about the division or disunity among Latinos. That has widened. It\u2019s more palpable this election. Usually we have voted Democrat but that has been eroded.\u201d</p> \n<p>Morales saw a union organiser speaking about Project 2025 and arranged a similar talk aimed at the union hall. Only about 30 people attended but the speakers hoped that, as with Lopez, it would jolt them into pressing their families, friends and neighbors to vote.</p> \n<p>Maria Echaveste, deputy chief of staff in Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, was at the meeting after traveling from California to whip up the vote in Michigan because she said she \u201ccould not sit back\u201d because the constitution and rule of law were at stake.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe had one term of Trump, we saw what happened. He\u2019s been very clear about what he intends to do if he gets the White House,\u201d she told the audience.</p> \n<p>Echaveste also had a warning for people in the Latino community if Trump gets back in and they haven\u2019t voted.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe lose this, they\u2019re going to be looking for someone to blame, and they\u2019re going to blame Latinos,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Lopez wasn\u2019t sure whether she would be able to persuade her middle-aged daughters.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think they don\u2019t vote because they don\u2019t really believe that anything will change, that anything can change, that our government has gotten so corrupt or controlled that their votes don\u2019t matter. They\u2019re disillusioned. They\u2019re just tired of the whole thing. I don\u2019t know how many people feel that way, but I know I can speak for my two daughters that have not voted,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>A 10-minute drive away, Black community leaders pressed a similar get-out-the-vote message at the Mt Olive Institutional Missionary Baptist church. They too were deeply worried about turnout.</p> \n<p>Terry Pruitt, the head of the NAACP\u2019s Saginaw branch, told the audience he was concerned that many Black voters did not appreciate what is at stake in this election and that whoever wins \u201cwill be making decisions that will impact us for decades\u201d including with appointments to the supreme court.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen we stay on the battlefield, when we really fight hard, guess what? Most of the time we win,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m looking out there, and it\u2019s almost like talking to the choir, because I know what y\u2019all going to do, alright, so the calling to action has to go beyond these doors. Every day, figure out who it is you\u2019re going to talk to, those 10 people, to remind them that we\u2019re in voting season. On election day, those 20 people you go call and say: \u2018Friend, relative, co-worker, I voted. I\u2019m asking you to do the same thing.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Terry Reed runs a community organisation aimed at keeping young men out of trouble in a city with one of the highest crime rates in Michigan.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis vote, this upcoming election, is more important than anything we\u2019ve ever imagined. Not only is it about you as grown folks, it\u2019s about these kids,\u201d he told the audience.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat if that person we need in office missed it by one vote because y\u2019all was at home sitting around and you could have made a difference? Do you want that on you? Do you want that on these upcoming kids?\u201d</p> \n<p>The church\u2019s pastor, Joshua Daniels, hosted the meeting. Officially, it was a non-partisan get-out-the-vote initiative but he, like other speakers, made clear he was backing Harris.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe gotta put her there not because she\u2019s Black, that can\u2019t be our motivation, but because she\u2019s just a better option,\u201d he said. \u201cTonight we are encouraging everybody to go vote.\u201d</p> \n<p>Daniels told the Guardian he organised the meeting because \u201ca lot of people really don\u2019t believe in the value of their vote\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/26/swing-state-polls-pennsylvania-michigan-georgia-arizona-wisconsin-nevada-north-carolina\">These seven states will decide the election. Here\u2019s what we learned reporting on the ground</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cMany people in the African American community specifically believe: \u2018What is one vote going to matter? My vote won\u2019t count.\u2019 And so we\u2019re trying to mobilise them to let them know your vote does matter, your vote has value, and we need you to exercise that,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Heidi Wiggins, who is running for Saginaw city council and will vote for Harris, was in the audience at the church. She is worried about apathy and that \u201cpeople might assume someone else is going to take care of it\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are disenfranchised. They don\u2019t believe anything works. They don\u2019t believe anyone\u2019s going to hear their voice or changes are going to be made. So to get through that is very difficult when people have to work two or three jobs, when there\u2019s three or four generations living in one house, and they\u2019re trying to figure out how they\u2019re gonna buy a gallon of milk,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cTheir focus is survival but we have to remind people that it does matter what they do.

      "bodyText": "Alice Lopez left the union hall so disturbed by what she had just heard that she determined she would persuade her daughters to vote even though they had never done so before. A friend had taken Lopez to a meeting arranged by Latino community leaders in bellwether Saginaw county, Michigan, to discuss Project 2025, the authoritarian plan to impose rightwing control across the entire US government if Donald Trump wins, in an attempt to jolt complacent and indifferent voters into turning out on Tuesday. Lopez, a health department caseworker, listened with increasing alarm as the impact of the project on workers\u2019 rights, its strategy to wreck public education and public broadcasting, and its plan to turn the justice department into a political weapon against Trump\u2019s opponents was laid out. \u201cI didn\u2019t know any of this. Everyone should know,\u201d she said. Lopez said that she is even more determined to keep Trump out of the White House but is concerned that people around her will not turn out to vote because they don\u2019t understand the threat. \u201cI\u2019m not only worried, I know for a fact that people aren\u2019t voting. I have two daughters that have never voted. I am going to do everything I possibly can to convince them that this year of all years, I\u2019m going to ask them to do it for me, just to do it for me, because that\u2019s two votes right there,\u201d she said. In another part of Saginaw, Black community leaders were sounding similar warnings at a meeting in a church amid simmering fears that ambivalent and disenchanted voters will stay home in a key county in a battleground state. Barack Obama won Saginaw county twice. Donald Trump then beat Hillary Clinton by a little more than 1,000 votes in 2016. Four years later, Joe Biden took the county by an even narrower margin of just 303 votes. But in that election, Trump\u2019s votes went up. He only lost because Democrats who stayed home in 2016 turned out in large numbers to remove Trump from the White House four years later. Kamala Harris may well need the same kind of turnout this year to win. The Harris campaign sees reasons for optimism. The vice-president\u2019s entry into the race injected a new enthusiasm among some younger voters in Saginaw. The supreme court\u2019s quashing of abortion rights continues to anger many female voters. Then there is the fear factor: there is no shortage of Americans scared for the future of their democracy if Trump returns to the Oval Office. But will it be enough to push Harris across the line in Saginaw county? Some minority community leaders fear not. There is a general recognition that Harris has run a much better ground game than Clinton did eight years ago when she was so confident of winning that she barely bothered to turn up in Michigan and then lost the state. But there is concern that Harris has played it too safe on policies, which has reinforced a sense that she will change little if elected, and is too reliant on Trump to undermine his own campaign or scare people into voting against him. Campaigners are focussed on minority communities in Saginaw because they have traditionally had a lower turnout than more prosperous parts of the county with large white populations, which provide Trump with most of his votes. For that reason, some Harris supporters believe areas such as inner Saginaw city have the greatest potential to find extra votes. Rosa Morales thought the Democrats weren\u2019t paying enough attention to Latino voters in Saginaw, where she was born and lives. \u201cWhere are the resources? It\u2019s like they take us for granted. I\u2019m worried, it\u2019s so narrow,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard about the division or disunity among Latinos. That has widened. It\u2019s more palpable this election. Usually we have voted Democrat but that has been eroded.\u201d Morales saw a union organiser speaking about Project 2025 and arranged a similar talk aimed at the union hall. Only about 30 people attended but the speakers hoped that, as with Lopez, it would jolt them into pressing their families, friends and neighbors to vote. Maria Echaveste, deputy chief of staff in Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, was at the meeting after traveling from California to whip up the vote in Michigan because she said she \u201ccould not sit back\u201d because the constitution and rule of law were at stake. \u201cWe had one term of Trump, we saw what happened. He\u2019s been very clear about what he intends to do if he gets the White House,\u201d she told the audience. Echaveste also had a warning for people in the Latino community if Trump gets back in and they haven\u2019t voted. \u201cWe lose this, they\u2019re going to be looking for someone to blame, and they\u2019re going to blame Latinos,\u201d she said. Lopez wasn\u2019t sure whether she would be able to persuade her middle-aged daughters. \u201cI think they don\u2019t vote because they don\u2019t really believe that anything will change, that anything can change, that our government has gotten so corrupt or controlled that their votes don\u2019t matter. They\u2019re disillusioned. They\u2019re just tired of the whole thing. I don\u2019t know how many people feel that way, but I know I can speak for my two daughters that have not voted,\u201d she said. A 10-minute drive away, Black community leaders pressed a similar get-out-the-vote message at the Mt Olive Institutional Missionary Baptist church. They too were deeply worried about turnout. Terry Pruitt, the head of the NAACP\u2019s Saginaw branch, told the audience he was concerned that many Black voters did not appreciate what is at stake in this election and that whoever wins \u201cwill be making decisions that will impact us for decades\u201d including with appointments to the supreme court. \u201cWhen we stay on the battlefield, when we really fight hard, guess what? Most of the time we win,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m looking out there, and it\u2019s almost like talking to the choir, because I know what y\u2019all going to do, alright, so the calling to action has to go beyond these doors. Every day, figure out who it is you\u2019re going to talk to, those 10 people, to remind them that we\u2019re in voting season. On election day, those 20 people you go call and say: \u2018Friend, relative, co-worker, I voted. I\u2019m asking you to do the same thing.\u2019\u201d Terry Reed runs a community organisation aimed at keeping young men out of trouble in a city with one of the highest crime rates in Michigan. \u201cThis vote, this upcoming election, is more important than anything we\u2019ve ever imagined. Not only is it about you as grown folks, it\u2019s about these kids,\u201d he told the audience. \u201cWhat if that person we need in office missed it by one vote because y\u2019all was at home sitting around and you could have made a difference? Do you want that on you? Do you want that on these upcoming kids?\u201d The church\u2019s pastor, Joshua Daniels, hosted the meeting. Officially, it was a non-partisan get-out-the-vote initiative but he, like other speakers, made clear he was backing Harris. \u201cWe gotta put her there not because she\u2019s Black, that can\u2019t be our motivation, but because she\u2019s just a better option,\u201d he said. \u201cTonight we are encouraging everybody to go vote.\u201d Daniels told the Guardian he organised the meeting because \u201ca lot of people really don\u2019t believe in the value of their vote\u201d. \u201cMany people in the African American community specifically believe: \u2018What is one vote going to matter? My vote won\u2019t count.\u2019 And so we\u2019re trying to mobilise them to let them know your vote does matter, your vote has value, and we need you to exercise that,\u201d he said. Heidi Wiggins, who is running for Saginaw city council and will vote for Harris, was in the audience at the church. She is worried about apathy and that \u201cpeople might assume someone else is going to take care of it\u201d. \u201cPeople are disenfranchised. They don\u2019t believe anything works. They don\u2019t believe anyone\u2019s going to hear their voice or changes are going to be made. So to get through that is very difficult when people have to work two or three jobs, when there\u2019s three or four generations living in one house, and they\u2019re trying to figure out how they\u2019re gonna buy a gallon of milk,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir focus is survival but we have to remind people that it does matter what they do. They can change what\u2019s going on and what\u2019s happening to them if they do make their voice heard.\u201d But plenty of people in Saginaw are sceptical of that claim after concluding that it makes little difference to their lives whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House. Community leaders say there are plenty of legitimate criticisms to be made of the failures of successive Democratic administrations to improve the lives of those with the least or to reform a system heavily weighted in favor of the wealthy and corporations. But for now, they say, the focus should be on defeating Trump. Echaveste also implicitly criticised the Democratic party for failing to connect with Latinos and minority communities in places. \u201cI\u2019m going to spend the rest of my life being the squeakiest wheel to the political parties about the fact that they don\u2019t invest in our community,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a generation who is despondent, who says: \u2018Look, what\u2019s the point?\u2019 I got a 23-year-old daughter who I\u2019m forcing to vote. But she\u2019s like, is Harris really going to be a difference? And the only reason she\u2019s going to vote is she knows Trump is going to be worse.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>What are you most looking forward to, on or off the court?</h2> <p><strong>The dissolution of the Pac-12 means some new and unusual conference battles</strong> that look like midseason Sweet 16 matchups. UCLA v Indiana in Bloomington? Arizona v Kansas in Lawrence? Regular-season basketball in the Big Ten and Big 12 will either produce battle-tested teams for the NCAA tournament \u2026 or exhausted ones. <strong>Gabriel Baumgaertner</strong></p> <p><strong>Seeing what\u2019s next for the women\u2019s game.</strong> The NCAA women\u2019s tournament final outdrawing the men\u2019s title game would have been unthinkable even a couple of years ago, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/apr/09/ncaa-basketball-womens-ratings-better-than-mens-tournament\">that\u2019s exactly what happened in April</a> thanks to stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. They\u2019ve since departed for the WNBA, but the machinery that got them in front of eyeballs (increased funding, social media, NIL deals) appears built to last. UConn\u2019s Paige Bueckers, USC\u2019s JuJu Watkins, LSU\u2019s Flau\u2019jae Johnson and Notre Dame\u2019s Hannah Hidalgo are just a few of the returning stars ready to take up the baton. <strong>Bryan Armen Graham</strong></p> <p><strong>Watching Bueckers playing her final season </strong>and this year\u2019s potential WNBA rookies battle it out on the court. I\u2019m also looking forward to becoming more familiar with NCAA men\u2019s basketball that I\u2019ve been in the past. As someone born and raised in the state, I am backing Alabama and excited to learn more about the team this year. <strong>Stephanie Kaloi</strong></p> <p><strong>How the veteran coaches will do at their new stops.</strong> Guys like John Calipari at Arkansas, Eric Musselman at Southern California and Mark Pope at Kentucky. All three had disappointing finishes to last year\u2019s season and will look to bounce back with a change in scenery. In year one at their previous stops all three got off to a hot start with 20-plus wins respectively. <strong>Nicholas Levine</strong></p> <h2>Cooper Flagg is the most exciting college prospect since \u2026</h2> <p><strong>Carmelo Anthony.</strong> None other than <a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/food-drink/drinks/a62371732/lebron-james-hennessy-limited-edition-interview/?taid=66f568e7c50d320001ca2cd5&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthemTWESQ&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter\">LeBron James indicated</a> that Flagg will be \u201ca big-time player for Team USA down the road\u201d. It\u2019s a lot of hype and one college season is almost never a great indicator of future success, but he is a super-prospect who is all but guaranteed to be the No 1 overall pick in 2025 NBA draft. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p>You don\u2019t even have to leave Durham to find him. Even if you didn\u2019t go in for the bully ball of <strong>Zion Williamson</strong> stylistically, there\u2019s no question the Duke star moved the needle both before and during his brief spell on campus. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>Caitlin Clark!</strong> I promise I\u2019m not just stanning. Clark was the necessary catalyst to spur changes to the WNBA that were already in motion. After last year\u2019s relatively underwhelming NBA draft class, Flagg is the kind of headline-grabbing prospect that will make this season of NCAA men\u2019s basketball fun to watch. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>Kevin Durant.</strong> Flagg has a rare skillset and feel for the game for someone with his size. At 6ft 9in Flagg can score from all three levels and guard multiple positions on defense. He is still only 17, which adds to his intrigue. He may not be the scorer Durant was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCaXpKFHAaE\">in his only year at Texas</a>, but Flagg may be able to make more of an impact with his overall game. <strong>NL</strong></p>    <h2>Has NIL been good or bad for college basketball?</h2> <p><strong>It seems to have created significantly more parity</strong>, making the NCAA tournament more unpredictable than ever. Ultimately, the most successful programs will be the ones that are able to retain their top talent for more than one season and form a cohesive unit with the inevitable transfers that arrive. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p><strong>Your mileage may vary.</strong> March Madness has become a billion-dollar business, so it was about time the players were permitted to earn something for what\u2019s effectively a full-time job. But the transfer portal and loosening of NIL rules has warped the recruiting process almost beyond recognition, prompting the early retirements of great coaches like Tony Bennett and Jay Wright (with plenty more certain to follow). <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>Depends on who you ask.</strong> NIL has been great for many players, and a not-so-great thing for many teams. I really love that athletes who generate so much money are being compensated for doing so but don\u2019t love how this encourages players to hop from school to school and to overlook some programs entirely because they can\u2019t bring a lot of NIL money to the table. This has skewed the dynamic between the pursuit of basketball and financial reward; players are not going to programs because those programs will benefit them (and vice-versa), they\u2019re going to whatever program can pay them the most. A great example is Hailey Van Lith, who was once predicted to be a top-10 draft pick but has since fallen off most lists completely due to the pursuit of financial gain. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>Not great in its current form.</strong> Bennett was not shy about his feelings on the state of college basketball and why that was a factor into his unexpected retirement. NIL was originally meant to allow the players to earn money based on their marketability. It has evolved into guaranteed payments before a kid even steps on campus and is a major factor in recruiting. The NCAA needs to establish guidelines that will help get NIL back to the way it was originally intended: to help student-athletes. <strong>NL</strong></p> <h2>The surprise package of the season will be \u2026</h2> <p><strong>Rutgers\u2019 men\u2019s team</strong> features two players \u2013 Ace Bailey and Dylan Harper \u2013 who may be top-five selections in the 2025 NBA draft. It\u2019s a challenge for any head coach to make a deep tournament run led by one-and-dones (just ask Calipari), but Steve Pikiell is a skilled tactician who values toughness and discipline. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p><strong>Indiana men.</strong> After finishing 19-14 last year and missing the NCAA tournament, the Hoosiers are sufficiently armed for a bounceback season after adding heralded transfers Oumar Ballo, Myles Rice and Kanaan Carlyle to the returning core. It will be on coach Mike Woodson to get the rotations right, but there\u2019s enough talent on the roster to see Indiana through to their first Elite Eight appearance in more than two decades. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>Texas women.</strong> After more than a few false starts (they haven\u2019t been to the Final Four since 2003), I am absolutely convinced this is the Longhorns\u2019 year. Rori Harmon is back from injury and from all reports is better than ever, while Madison Booker appears to have grown into a leadership role after taking the first steps last season. The rest of the teams in the Big 12 need to watch out. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p>The <strong>University of California San Diego men</strong>. Making the transition from D-II, the Tritons shocked the Big West last year finishing second in the conference after the preseason coaches poll predicted they would end up ninth. They\u2019ll look to build that success with an experienced roster of proven scorers: six of their current players have already eclipsed the 1,000-point mark. Don\u2019t be surprised if you see the Tritons playing in the NCAA tournament for the first time that they\u2019re eligible. <strong>NL</strong></p> <h2>Which team in either preseason top 10 will struggle?</h2> <p>It would be a shock to see any of these teams miss, but the <strong>Arizona men</strong> will find life much more challenging in the Big 12 than they did in the Pac-12. Maybe the Wildcats enter the tournament as a No 6 or No 7 seed instead of theur usual slot around No 2. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p><strong>Iowa State women.</strong> Super sophomore Audi Crooks, whose national profile does not yet correspond to her talent level, will be the focal point in the post. And head coach Bill Fennelly did manage to address last year\u2019s three-point shooting woes by adding Lily Hansford, Kenzie Hare and Sydney Harris through the portal. But can they defend? <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>Iowa State women.</strong> The Cyclones have a lofty No 8 preseason ranking, but their non-conference schedule is extremely challenging: they\u2019ll go up against South Carolina, Iowa and UConn. They may surprise me and pull it off, but ... I\u2019m not convinced this is their year. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>North Carolina men.</strong> The Tar Heels do return the ACC player of the year in RJ Davis, who should once again be among the conference leaders in scoring, but will he be as effective without Armando Bacot? The departed 6ft 11in center demanded interior attention and forced opponents to make difficult decisions on how to guard the Davis-Bacot ball screens. There is no one on the roster with the size and athleticism to fill his shoes. UNC also lost key pieces in Cormac Ryan and Harrison Ingram. <strong>NL</strong></p>    <h2>The men\u2019s national player of the year will be \u2026</h2> <p><strong>RJ Davis, North Carolina.</strong> Flagg is the easy answer, but I\u2019ll guess that the gatekeepers prefer to vote for a veteran senior guard before an all-world freshman. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p><strong>Mark Sears, Alabama.</strong> Granted an extra year of eligibility due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the 6ft 1in point guard is back for a fifth season after leading the Crimson Tide to the first Final Four in school history last March while shooting better than 50% from the floor and 43% from three. Nate Oats\u2019 fast-paced offense will give his statistics the extra juice they\u2019ll need in a competitive race. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>Mark Sears, Alabama.</strong> He was arguably the best player in men\u2019s college basketball last year and it\u2019s hard to imagine him doing anything but improving this year. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>Hunter Dickinson, Kansas.</strong> The Jayhawks have question marks, but if they can live up to the hype I expect them to be the overall No 1 seed with the experienced Dickinson, who transferred from Michigan the year before last, being the best player on the best team. <strong>NL</strong></p> <h2>The women\u2019s national player of the year will be \u2026</h2> <p><strong>Paige Bueckers, UConn.</strong> It\u2019s been a long, injury-riddled journey for the standout UConn guard, but she\u2019ll need to be an anchor for the otherwise young Huskies. Look for her to remind the country why she was considered a potentially generational talent before the nation knew of Clark. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p><strong>JuJu Watkins, Southern California. </strong>Coke or Pepsi? Xbox or PlayStation? The season-long debate between Watkins and Bueckers (and their passionate fandoms) is already off to a <a href=\"https://www.themirror.com/sport/basketball/juju-watkins-paige-bueckers-basketball-780479\">heated start</a>. It\u2019s too close to call at the moment and may not be much easier in March. Save the date: Watkins\u2019 Trojans meet Bueckers\u2019 Huskies in a 21 December non-conference game at Hartford\u2019s XL Center that\u2019s already sold out. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>JuJu Watkins, Southern California.</strong> She was the player to watch last year as a freshman and there is no reason to doubt that she will be even more compelling this season. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>JuJu Watkins, Southern California. </strong>Watkins will look to build off of her incredible freshman campaign in which she lit up the scoresheet nightly with averages of 27.1 points, 7.3 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 2.3 steals per game. Her feel for the game and overall skillset make her the most dynamic women\u2019s player in the country. <strong>NL</strong></p>    <h2>The hottest NBA prospect is \u2026</h2> <p><strong>Cooper Flagg, Duke.</strong> If he passes and handles the ball as well as scouts say he does, he\u2019ll draw the loftiest comparisons imaginable (like, say, Magic Johnson). <strong>GB</strong></p> <p><strong>Cooper Flagg, Duke.</strong> Most have had the combo forward pencilled in for the No 1 pick for some time and with good reason.

She may not attract the attention that Clark did, but Watkins will put up some gaudy scoring totals and might average double-digit rebounds too. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p><strong>Paige Bueckers, Connecticut.</strong> For the second straight year, the No 1 pick in the WNBA draft will be a no-brainer. And thanks to the LA Sparks\u2019 dismal nine-win season, <a href=\"https://www.wnba.com/news/wnba-lottery-2025-statefarm\">there\u2019s a good chance</a> she\u2019ll end up alongside Cameron Brink and Rickea Jackson in Hollywood, a prospect that will no doubt have the league\u2019s marketing department salivating. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>Paige Bueckers, Connecticut.</strong> She is widely expected to have a dominant final collegiate season and will undoubtedly be drafted at the No 1 or No 2 spot \u2013 but USC\u2019s Kiki Iriafen, who transferred from Stanford, is right there with her. For me, the pair are neck-and-neck for this title. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>JuJu Watkins, Southern California</strong>. She has the size and skill to be an immediate star in the W whenever she decides to make the jump. <strong>NL</strong></p>    <h2>One bold prediction</h2> <p><strong>The UConn men are knocked out in the first weekend.</strong> Huskies coach Dan Hurley is brilliant, but he has to replace four NBA draft picks and get a very new team to adjust to his extremely intense and demanding playing style. Hurley is not a coach to bet against, but this year will be a challenge for the defending champs and their bid for a rare NCAA tournament three-peat will be thwarted earlier than expected. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p><strong>A men\u2019s team will win their first national championship.</strong> Alabama, Houston and Gonzaga each have the personnel to make Final Four runs. It says here one of them will break through for their school\u2019s maiden title. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>Rori Harmon will get chosen in the top five of the WNBA draft.</strong> Maybe even top three. Everyone has the 5ft 6in point guard projected lower in the draft and with good reason, but I expect Harmon to have such a monster year for Texas that it will be hard for too many teams to pass her over. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>The Villanova men win the Big East.</strong> The Wildcats are coming off consecutive below-standard years and head coach Kyle Neptune needs to turn that around in year three. With a talented roster with a mix of returners and transfers, Villanova could surprise the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/jan/10/college-basketball-big-east-conference-renaissance\">college basketball\u2019s purest conference</a>. Look for La Salle point guard transfer Jhamir Brikus to have a breakout year. <strong>NL</strong></p> <h2>Men\u2019s Final Four</h2> <p>Alabama, Florida, Gonzaga, Houston. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p>Alabama, Duke, Houston, Kansas. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>Connecticut, Duke, Gonzaga, Iowa State. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p>Arizona, Gonzaga, Kansas, Purdue. <strong>NL</strong></p> <h2>Men\u2019s national champion</h2> <p><strong>Houston</strong> coach Kelvin Sampson has spent much of the last decade on the wrong end of untimely injuries and heartbreaking buzzer-beaters in March. This year, he leads a balanced veteran squad to the title that has eluded him since he took the Cougars job in 2014. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p><strong>Alabama.</strong> The Crimson Tide return five rotation players from a Final Four team, including a first-team preseason All-American at the point, while adding four heralded transfers and a pair of five-star recruits. It\u2019s a cocktail of depth and experience that will benefit from playing in college basketball\u2019s deepest conference and be aged to perfection by March. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>Gonzaga.</strong> Right now, I feel like this year is the Bulldogs\u2019 to lose after multiple seasons of coming so close. The team is full of talented returning players including offensive standouts Graham Ike and Nolan Hickman in addition to Ryan Nembhard, who brings a stability that\u2019s needed. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>Kansas.</strong> Bill Self has a predicted starting lineup of all juniors and seniors. Dickinson and Dajuan Harris Jr are two of the most experienced big game players in college basketball. If the Jayhawks stay healthy they could be tearing down nets in San Antonio. <strong>NL</strong></p> <h2>Women\u2019s Final Four</h2> <p>Connecticut, North Carolina State, South Carolina, UCLA. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p>Connecticut, Notre Dame, Texas, South Carolina. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>Connecticut, South Carolina, Southern California, Texas. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p>Connecticut, Notre Dame, South Carolina, Southern California. <strong>NL</strong></p> <h2>Women\u2019s national champion</h2> <p><strong>South Carolina.</strong> It feels lazy to select the Gamecocks every year, but head coach Dawn Staley more or less overhauled her team\u2019s playing style last year (after the prior year\u2019s team lost in the Final Four) to incorporate better outside shooting. The Gamecocks finished the season 38-0 and won their third national title in seven tournaments. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p><strong>South Carolina.</strong> Kamilla Cardoso, who led last year\u2019s undefeated national champions in scoring, rebounds, blocks and field-goal percentage, has left for the WNBA. But Staley\u2019s squad returns 87% of their minutes played and 84% of their points scored. You\u2019ve got to give them the edge at the moment over UConn, who will start the season without a number of key players due to injury. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>South Carolina \u2026 </strong>or<strong> Southern California.</strong> I don\u2019t want to answer this question! Any answer other than South Carolina feels wrong, but USC is an answer that doesn\u2019t feel \u2026 <em>not</em> right.

      "bodyText": "What are you most looking forward to, on or off the court? The dissolution of the Pac-12 means some new and unusual conference battles that look like midseason Sweet 16 matchups. UCLA v Indiana in Bloomington? Arizona v Kansas in Lawrence? Regular-season basketball in the Big Ten and Big 12 will either produce battle-tested teams for the NCAA tournament \u2026 or exhausted ones. Gabriel Baumgaertner Seeing what\u2019s next for the women\u2019s game. The NCAA women\u2019s tournament final outdrawing the men\u2019s title game would have been unthinkable even a couple of years ago, but that\u2019s exactly what happened in April thanks to stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. They\u2019ve since departed for the WNBA, but the machinery that got them in front of eyeballs (increased funding, social media, NIL deals) appears built to last. UConn\u2019s Paige Bueckers, USC\u2019s JuJu Watkins, LSU\u2019s Flau\u2019jae Johnson and Notre Dame\u2019s Hannah Hidalgo are just a few of the returning stars ready to take up the baton. Bryan Armen Graham Watching Bueckers playing her final season and this year\u2019s potential WNBA rookies battle it out on the court. I\u2019m also looking forward to becoming more familiar with NCAA men\u2019s basketball that I\u2019ve been in the past. As someone born and raised in the state, I am backing Alabama and excited to learn more about the team this year. Stephanie Kaloi How the veteran coaches will do at their new stops. Guys like John Calipari at Arkansas, Eric Musselman at Southern California and Mark Pope at Kentucky. All three had disappointing finishes to last year\u2019s season and will look to bounce back with a change in scenery. In year one at their previous stops all three got off to a hot start with 20-plus wins respectively. Nicholas Levine Cooper Flagg is the most exciting college prospect since \u2026 Carmelo Anthony. None other than LeBron James indicated that Flagg will be \u201ca big-time player for Team USA down the road\u201d. It\u2019s a lot of hype and one college season is almost never a great indicator of future success, but he is a super-prospect who is all but guaranteed to be the No 1 overall pick in 2025 NBA draft. GB You don\u2019t even have to leave Durham to find him. Even if you didn\u2019t go in for the bully ball of Zion Williamson stylistically, there\u2019s no question the Duke star moved the needle both before and during his brief spell on campus. BAG Caitlin Clark! I promise I\u2019m not just stanning. Clark was the necessary catalyst to spur changes to the WNBA that were already in motion. After last year\u2019s relatively underwhelming NBA draft class, Flagg is the kind of headline-grabbing prospect that will make this season of NCAA men\u2019s basketball fun to watch. SK Kevin Durant. Flagg has a rare skillset and feel for the game for someone with his size. At 6ft 9in Flagg can score from all three levels and guard multiple positions on defense. He is still only 17, which adds to his intrigue. He may not be the scorer Durant was in his only year at Texas, but Flagg may be able to make more of an impact with his overall game. NL Has NIL been good or bad for college basketball? It seems to have created significantly more parity, making the NCAA tournament more unpredictable than ever. Ultimately, the most successful programs will be the ones that are able to retain their top talent for more than one season and form a cohesive unit with the inevitable transfers that arrive. GB Your mileage may vary. March Madness has become a billion-dollar business, so it was about time the players were permitted to earn something for what\u2019s effectively a full-time job. But the transfer portal and loosening of NIL rules has warped the recruiting process almost beyond recognition, prompting the early retirements of great coaches like Tony Bennett and Jay Wright (with plenty more certain to follow). BAG Depends on who you ask. NIL has been great for many players, and a not-so-great thing for many teams. I really love that athletes who generate so much money are being compensated for doing so but don\u2019t love how this encourages players to hop from school to school and to overlook some programs entirely because they can\u2019t bring a lot of NIL money to the table. This has skewed the dynamic between the pursuit of basketball and financial reward; players are not going to programs because those programs will benefit them (and vice-versa), they\u2019re going to whatever program can pay them the most. A great example is Hailey Van Lith, who was once predicted to be a top-10 draft pick but has since fallen off most lists completely due to the pursuit of financial gain. SK Not great in its current form. Bennett was not shy about his feelings on the state of college basketball and why that was a factor into his unexpected retirement. NIL was originally meant to allow the players to earn money based on their marketability. It has evolved into guaranteed payments before a kid even steps on campus and is a major factor in recruiting. The NCAA needs to establish guidelines that will help get NIL back to the way it was originally intended: to help student-athletes. NL The surprise package of the season will be \u2026 Rutgers\u2019 men\u2019s team features two players \u2013 Ace Bailey and Dylan Harper \u2013 who may be top-five selections in the 2025 NBA draft. It\u2019s a challenge for any head coach to make a deep tournament run led by one-and-dones (just ask Calipari), but Steve Pikiell is a skilled tactician who values toughness and discipline. GB Indiana men. After finishing 19-14 last year and missing the NCAA tournament, the Hoosiers are sufficiently armed for a bounceback season after adding heralded transfers Oumar Ballo, Myles Rice and Kanaan Carlyle to the returning core. It will be on coach Mike Woodson to get the rotations right, but there\u2019s enough talent on the roster to see Indiana through to their first Elite Eight appearance in more than two decades. BAG Texas women. After more than a few false starts (they haven\u2019t been to the Final Four since 2003), I am absolutely convinced this is the Longhorns\u2019 year. Rori Harmon is back from injury and from all reports is better than ever, while Madison Booker appears to have grown into a leadership role after taking the first steps last season. The rest of the teams in the Big 12 need to watch out. SK The University of California San Diego men. Making the transition from D-II, the Tritons shocked the Big West last year finishing second in the conference after the preseason coaches poll predicted they would end up ninth. They\u2019ll look to build that success with an experienced roster of proven scorers: six of their current players have already eclipsed the 1,000-point mark. Don\u2019t be surprised if you see the Tritons playing in the NCAA tournament for the first time that they\u2019re eligible. NL Which team in either preseason top 10 will struggle? It would be a shock to see any of these teams miss, but the Arizona men will find life much more challenging in the Big 12 than they did in the Pac-12. Maybe the Wildcats enter the tournament as a No 6 or No 7 seed instead of theur usual slot around No 2. GB Iowa State women. Super sophomore Audi Crooks, whose national profile does not yet correspond to her talent level, will be the focal point in the post. And head coach Bill Fennelly did manage to address last year\u2019s three-point shooting woes by adding Lily Hansford, Kenzie Hare and Sydney Harris through the portal. But can they defend? BAG Iowa State women. The Cyclones have a lofty No 8 preseason ranking, but their non-conference schedule is extremely challenging: they\u2019ll go up against South Carolina, Iowa and UConn. They may surprise me and pull it off, but ... I\u2019m not convinced this is their year. SK North Carolina men. The Tar Heels do return the ACC player of the year in RJ Davis, who should once again be among the conference leaders in scoring, but will he be as effective without Armando Bacot? The departed 6ft 11in center demanded interior attention and forced opponents to make difficult decisions on how to guard the Davis-Bacot ball screens. There is no one on the roster with the size and athleticism to fill his shoes. UNC also lost key pieces in Cormac Ryan and Harrison Ingram. NL The men\u2019s national player of the year will be \u2026 RJ Davis, North Carolina. Flagg is the easy answer, but I\u2019ll guess that the gatekeepers prefer to vote for a veteran senior guard before an all-world freshman. GB Mark Sears, Alabama. Granted an extra year of eligibility due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the 6ft 1in point guard is back for a fifth season after leading the Crimson Tide to the first Final Four in school history last March while shooting better than 50% from the floor and 43% from three. Nate Oats\u2019 fast-paced offense will give his statistics the extra juice they\u2019ll need in a competitive race. BAG Mark Sears, Alabama. He was arguably the best player in men\u2019s college basketball last year and it\u2019s hard to imagine him doing anything but improving this year. SK Hunter Dickinson, Kansas. The Jayhawks have question marks, but if they can live up to the hype I expect them to be the overall No 1 seed with the experienced Dickinson, who transferred from Michigan the year before last, being the best player on the best team. NL The women\u2019s national player of the year will be \u2026 Paige Bueckers, UConn. It\u2019s been a long, injury-riddled journey for the standout UConn guard, but she\u2019ll need to be an anchor for the otherwise young Huskies. Look for her to remind the country why she was considered a potentially generational talent before the nation knew of Clark. GB JuJu Watkins, Southern California. Coke or Pepsi? Xbox or PlayStation? The season-long debate between Watkins and Bueckers (and their passionate fandoms) is already off to a heated start. It\u2019s too close to call at the moment and may not be much easier in March. Save the date: Watkins\u2019 Trojans meet Bueckers\u2019 Huskies in a 21 December non-conference game at Hartford\u2019s XL Center that\u2019s already sold out. BAG JuJu Watkins, Southern California. She was the player to watch last year as a freshman and there is no reason to doubt that she will be even more compelling this season. SK JuJu Watkins, Southern California. Watkins will look to build off of her incredible freshman campaign in which she lit up the scoresheet nightly with averages of 27.1 points, 7.3 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 2.3 steals per game. Her feel for the game and overall skillset make her the most dynamic women\u2019s player in the country. NL The hottest NBA prospect is \u2026 Cooper Flagg, Duke. If he passes and handles the ball as well as scouts say he does, he\u2019ll draw the loftiest comparisons imaginable (like, say, Magic Johnson). GB Cooper Flagg, Duke. Most have had the combo forward pencilled in for the No 1 pick for some time and with good reason. He was a cheat code in the Nike EYBL 16U league (averaging 26.8 points, 12.4 rebounds, 5.2 blocks and 4.7 assists), delivered on expectations in the Nike Hoop Summit and Jordan Brand Classic showcase games and was invited to practice with Team USA ahead of the Paris Olympics. BAG Cooper Flagg, Duke. Once he gets his freshman year out of the way he\u2019s going to be the central talking point of next year\u2019s draft. SK Cooper Flagg, Duke. A strong season for the Blue Devils would make Flagg the no-brainer No 1 overall pick. Let the Fail for Flagg campaign begin for NBA teams. NL The hottest WNBA prospect is \u2026 JuJu Watkins, Southern California. She averaged over 27 points per game in her freshman year and scored more points than any other freshman in Division I history (920). She may not attract the attention that Clark did, but Watkins will put up some gaudy scoring totals and might average double-digit rebounds too. GB Paige Bueckers, Connecticut. For the second straight year, the No 1 pick in the WNBA draft will be a no-brainer. And thanks to the LA Sparks\u2019 dismal nine-win season, there\u2019s a good chance she\u2019ll end up alongside Cameron Brink and Rickea Jackson in Hollywood, a prospect that will no doubt have the league\u2019s marketing department salivating. BAG Paige Bueckers, Connecticut. She is widely expected to have a dominant final collegiate season and will undoubtedly be drafted at the No 1 or No 2 spot \u2013 but USC\u2019s Kiki Iriafen, who transferred from Stanford, is right there with her. For me, the pair are neck-and-neck for this title. SK JuJu Watkins, Southern California. She has the size and skill to be an immediate star in the W whenever she decides to make the jump. NL One bold prediction The UConn men are knocked out in the first weekend. Huskies coach Dan Hurley is brilliant, but he has to replace four NBA draft picks and get a very new team to adjust to his extremely intense and demanding playing style. Hurley is not a coach to bet against, but this year will be a challenge for the defending champs and their bid for a rare NCAA tournament three-peat will be thwarted earlier than expected. GB A men\u2019s team will win their first national championship. Alabama, Houston and Gonzaga each have the personnel to make Final Four runs. It says here one of them will break through for their school\u2019s maiden title. BAG Rori Harmon will get chosen in the top five of the WNBA draft. Maybe even top three. Everyone has the 5ft 6in point guard projected lower in the draft and with good reason, but I expect Harmon to have such a monster year for Texas that it will be hard for too many teams to pass her over. SK The Villanova men win the Big East. The Wildcats are coming off consecutive below-standard years and head coach Kyle Neptune needs to turn that around in year three. With a talented roster with a mix of returners and transfers, Villanova could surprise the college basketball\u2019s purest conference. Look for La Salle point guard transfer Jhamir Brikus to have a breakout year. NL Men\u2019s Final Four Alabama, Florida, Gonzaga, Houston. GB Alabama, Duke, Houston, Kansas. BAG Connecticut, Duke, Gonzaga, Iowa State. SK Arizona, Gonzaga, Kansas, Purdue. NL Men\u2019s national champion Houston coach Kelvin Sampson has spent much of the last decade on the wrong end of untimely injuries and heartbreaking buzzer-beaters in March. This year, he leads a balanced veteran squad to the title that has eluded him since he took the Cougars job in 2014. GB Alabama. The Crimson Tide return five rotation players from a Final Four team, including a first-team preseason All-American at the point, while adding four heralded transfers and a pair of five-star recruits. It\u2019s a cocktail of depth and experience that will benefit from playing in college basketball\u2019s deepest conference and be aged to perfection by March. BAG Gonzaga. Right now, I feel like this year is the Bulldogs\u2019 to lose after multiple seasons of coming so close. The team is full of talented returning players including offensive standouts Graham Ike and Nolan Hickman in addition to Ryan Nembhard, who brings a stability that\u2019s needed. SK Kansas. Bill Self has a predicted starting lineup of all juniors and seniors. Dickinson and Dajuan Harris Jr are two of the most experienced big game players in college basketball. If the Jayhawks stay healthy they could be tearing down nets in San Antonio. NL Women\u2019s Final Four Connecticut, North Carolina State, South Carolina, UCLA. GB Connecticut, Notre Dame, Texas, South Carolina. BAG Connecticut, South Carolina, Southern California, Texas. SK Connecticut, Notre Dame, South Carolina, Southern California. NL Women\u2019s national champion South Carolina. It feels lazy to select the Gamecocks every year, but head coach Dawn Staley more or less overhauled her team\u2019s playing style last year (after the prior year\u2019s team lost in the Final Four) to incorporate better outside shooting. The Gamecocks finished the season 38-0 and won their third national title in seven tournaments. GB South Carolina. Kamilla Cardoso, who led last year\u2019s undefeated national champions in scoring, rebounds, blocks and field-goal percentage, has left for the WNBA.

You\u2019ve got to give them the edge at the moment over UConn, who will start the season without a number of key players due to injury. BAG South Carolina \u2026 or Southern California. I don\u2019t want to answer this question! Any answer other than South Carolina feels wrong, but USC is an answer that doesn\u2019t feel \u2026 not right. I\u2019m leaning toward the Gamecocks, but would not at all be surprised if the Trojans take it. SK Connecticut.

Outrageous, of course \u2013 but then it got worse. On Thursday, talking on stage with Tucker Carlson in Arizona, Donald Trump went after the former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, who opposes his re-election and has campaigned with Kamala Harris: \u201cLet\u2019s put her with a rifle with nine barrels shooting at her. Let\u2019s see how she feels about it when the guns are trained on her face.\u201d Cheney characterized this as \u201chow dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death.\u201d Meanwhile, in the final days of her campaign, Harris continued to call for unity, progress and inclusion.

      "body": "<p>While Democratic strategists debate <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/us/politics/harris-trump-campaign-fascism.html\">whether or not their attack ads</a> labeling Donald Trump a fascist have been effective, experts and academics told the Guardian his campaign and the Republican party he now heads have clear autocratic sympathies and political qualities that are firmly in line with fascism movements historically.</p> <p>Put together, that makes any Trump victory this week and his return to the White House for a second presidential term a clear threat to US democracy, they added.</p> <p>\u201cThere couldn\u2019t be a more obvious example of a fascist social and political movement about to take power,\u201d said Jason Stanley, a Yale philosophy professor whose new book, <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Erasing-History/Jason-Stanley/9781668056912\">Erasing History: How Fascists Rewrite the Past to Control the Future</a>, looks at the global playbook of fascists through the lens of America and beyond.</p> <p>Stanley continued: \u201cTrump and the people behind him have already promised to replace the government at all levels with loyalists. [LGBTQ+] citizens, particularly trans citizens and their families, will have to leave the country. Political opponents will be targeted in some way ranging from financial penalties to prison.\u201d</p> <p>Even Trump\u2019s own longest-serving chief of staff during his time in the White House, John Kelly, put his former boss under \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/john-kelly-trump-fitness-character.html\">the general definition of a fascist</a>\u201d, the same political category as the infamous Axis leaders Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Kamala Harris openly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/23/harris-trump-fascist-hitler-comments-election\">agreed with that assessment</a>.</p>    <p>Dr Brian Hughes, the associate director of the <a href=\"https://perilresearch.com\">Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab</a> at American University, said Trump has for years been accused of mimicking the rise to power of Hitler and Mussolini, for good reason.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s important to remember that fascism isn\u2019t a binary. Fascism is a process,\u201d said Hughes in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cSince the very beginning of the Trump campaign in 2015, there\u2019s been a lot of denialism and a lot of whistling past the graveyard, but the symptoms keep adding up.\u201d</p> <p>At the inception of his administration, Hughes pointed out, Trump instituted the Muslim ban and described Latino immigration as a sort of infestation, all classic fascistic attacks on \u201can enemy within, a group that can be targeted and scapegoated for all the problems of society\u201d.</p> <p>Then came the strongman tactics of trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election \u2013 a cause still pursued by many Trump acolytes who see him as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/deleuze-and-guattari-and-fascism/soy-boy-ecology-and-the-fascist-imaginary/75696FA3AB63E8A75AB899FA49CEAFEC\">fascist imaginary</a>\u201d, as Hughes puts it.</p> <p>\u201cNow we finally have stated policy goals of targeting political enemies, not just through lawfare, but also through violence and myriad other examples of plans to govern in a way that mirrors 20-century fascism,\u201d he said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There couldn\u2019t be a more obvious example of a fascist social and political movement about to take power</p> <footer> <cite>Jason Stanley, Yale</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Both Hitler and Mussolini similarly practiced the classic performance of screaming and hand-gesturing at rallies, threatening their enemies during their rise to power. Trump\u2019s off-the-cuff speech style, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/27/trump-madison-square-garden-rally\">now</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/11/donald-trump-campaign-claims-violence-rallies\">in previous campaigns</a>, has become synonymous with that kind of machismo and callback to the 30s.</p> <p>Even while in power, Trump set the stage for his comeback and the basis for what Stanley sees as a surefire fascist state to come.</p> <p>\u201cThe courts will be replaced by loyalists, as we have already seen with the supreme court of the United States,\u201d he said, referring to three ultra-conservative justices Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/25/trump-judges-supreme-court-justices-judiciary\">already installed while in power</a>. In Nazi Germany, government officials at all levels, legal and bureaucratic, had to declare strict allegiances to the party.</p> <p>Since those Trump appointments, the nation\u2019s highest court delivered landmark rulings overturning abortion rights and bestowing kingly powers to the presidency, almost akin to the Third Reich or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/15/us-far-right-francisco-franco-spanish-civil-war\">Spanish dictator Francisco Franco</a>, who ruled over his country until 1975.</p> <p>Critics say LGBTQ+ rights are next on his hit list of issues for the courts, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/sep/24/donald-trump-presidency-republican-lawmakers-targeting-lgbtq-policies\">if Trump returns to power</a>. Notably, the fascist governments of Hitler and Mussolini outlawed queer, Roma and Jewish people, disappearing those they deemed political undesirables in a series of mass killings or jailings that led up to their so-called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/07/final-solution-fate-jews-david-cesarani-review\">final solution</a>\u201d and the Holocaust.</p> <p>But the first stage of Trump\u2019s potential fascist-like state, as Stanley told the Guardian, will involve solidifying the authority of a single party, not unlike how <a href=\"https://x.com/PM_ViktorOrban/status/1851965484310180187\">Viktor Orb\u00e1n</a> of Hungary (often called a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/07/viktor-orban-to-visit-donald-trump-in-florida-hungary\">neo-fascist</a>\u201d) has eviscerated any semblance of an opposition in the former eastern bloc country.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think it\u2019s important to remember that fascism isn\u2019t a binary. Fascism is a process</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Brian Hughes, American University</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If Trump wins, Stanley said, \u201cAmerica will be a one-party state from now on\u201d forecasting that \u201cJD Vance or perhaps Donald Trump Jr\u201d will then replace Trump in the cult of personality as he ages or dies.</p> <p>\u201cThere will be no more meaningful federal elections,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Heidi Beirich, the co-founder of the <a href=\"https://globalextremism.org/post/racism-misogyny-kamala-harris-is-running-online/\">Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE)</a>, has for decades been a mainstay critic, analyst and academic authority on the American far right and said she fears the current political climate is veering towards fascism.</p> <p>Beirich called attention to how nationalist flirtations and pro-nativist periods in the 19th and 20th centuries have already given birth to organizations like the Ku Klux Klan, and to eugenics and the terroristic suppression of Black people all over the country in multiple eras, until the civil rights movement established legal equalities.</p> <p>\u201cThere was also a movement in support of the Nazi government, with groups like the American Bund prior to world war two,\u201d said Beirich, referring to a pro-Hitler and German-American political organization founded in 1936, which openly promoted Nazism.</p> <p>In 1939, mere months before the invasion of Poland, the Bund held a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Many critics compared that rally with Trump\u2019s own election rally in the famous arena last weekend. During the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2024/oct/29/donald-trump-defends-his-madison-square-garden-rally-as-love-fest-video\">love fest</a>\u201d, as the Republican candidate labeled it, speakers made several racist statements, including a joke about the entire island of Puerto Rico <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/27/trump-madison-square-garden-rally\">being \u201cgarbage\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u201cSo my takeaway is that anti-immigrant sentiment and race science, which is embraced by our growing white supremacist movements, have an American pedigree,\u201d said Beirich. \u201cIt is a worry that we could enter a new phase that revives this vile history.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Anti-immigrant sentiment and race science have an American pedigree. It is a worry that we could revive this vile history</p> <footer> <cite>Heidi Beirich, Global Project Against Hate and Extremism</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Beirich has <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/about/staff/heidi-beirich\">exposed the inner workings of several American neo-Nazi groups</a> for years and says those types of groups see the current political climate as an opportunity.</p> <p>\u201cThe far right is certainly in a more powerful position today than it has been in decades,\u201d she said, describing extremists who are desperately afraid of the racist great replacement theory, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/17/buffalo-shooting-fox-news-tucker-carlson-great-replacement-theory\">once promoted by Tucker Carlson</a> on Fox News before his firing.</p> <p>Beirich said that \u201cwhatever happens on election day, these growing, empowered far-right movements aren\u2019t going away\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey will form a cohesive political force for years to come, particularly as demographic change inevitably transforms this country from having a white majority to no ethnic majority,\u201d she continued.</p> <p>Many of the neo-Nazi terrorist groups recently born in America that Beirich has tracked were also admirers of the past. Members of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/neo-nazi-arrests-deals-blow-us-group-atomwaffen-division\">Atomwaffen Division</a> were known to worship the Third Reich and Mussolini, making a point of collecting artifacts from that era.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ispionline.it/en/bio/francesco-marone\">Francesco Marone</a>, an assistant professor at the <a href=\"https://www.unite.it/UniTE/Docente/Doc/fmarone\">University of Teramo</a> and a researcher at the Italian Institute for International Political Studies, whose own country gave birth to fascism, is less concerned or convinced that Trump is a fascist as much as that his aggressive actions threaten broader western political cohesion.</p> <p>\u201cOn the other hand, experts can identify<em> </em>partial similarities between Trump and Mussolini and fascist tendencies, such as a charismatic personality, capable of promoting a cult of personality, the emphasis placed on a presumed profound decadence and humiliation of the country, racist and male chauvinist attitudes, authoritarian tendencies (but in different degrees), ultranationalism, a propensity to demonize the political opponent,\u201d he said in an emailed message.</p> <p>Marone says Trump is an endemic character seen across the world and isn\u2019t quite a by-definition fascist, per se.</p> <p>\u201cThese general traits are shared by radical rightwing leaders active in other liberal democracies in the west,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly, the growth of an illiberal radical right appears to be a problem on an international scale in our age.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Read more of the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2024\">2024 US election coverage</a>:</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/05/us-election-2024-live-updates-donald-trump-vs-kamala-harris-results-presidential-elections-day-latest-news-polls-update\">US election 2024 live updates: latest polls, results and news</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/when-do-polls-close-election-day\">When do polls close</a>?</p></li> <li><p>How the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/election-electoral-college-votes-explained\">electoral college works</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/26/election-abortion-ballot-measures-states\">Where is abortion on the ballot?</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/18/senate-races-elections-to-watch\">Senate</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/11/house-races-2024-elections-explainer\">House</a> races to watch</p></li> <li><p>Lessons from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/26/swing-state-polls-pennsylvania-michigan-georgia-arizona-wisconsin-nevada-north-carolina\">key swing states</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/03/election-trump-harris-policies-issues\">Trump v Harris on key issues</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/nov/03/if-trump-wins-the-election-these-11-issues-will-be-under-threat\">What\u2019s at stake</a> in this election</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/nov/03/us-presidential-election-trump-harris\">What to know about the US election</a></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "While Democratic strategists debate whether or not their attack ads labeling Donald Trump a fascist have been effective, experts and academics told the Guardian his campaign and the Republican party he now heads have clear autocratic sympathies and political qualities that are firmly in line with fascism movements historically. Put together, that makes any Trump victory this week and his return to the White House for a second presidential term a clear threat to US democracy, they added. \u201cThere couldn\u2019t be a more obvious example of a fascist social and political movement about to take power,\u201d said Jason Stanley, a Yale philosophy professor whose new book, Erasing History: How Fascists Rewrite the Past to Control the Future, looks at the global playbook of fascists through the lens of America and beyond. Stanley continued: \u201cTrump and the people behind him have already promised to replace the government at all levels with loyalists. [LGBTQ+] citizens, particularly trans citizens and their families, will have to leave the country. Political opponents will be targeted in some way ranging from financial penalties to prison.\u201d Even Trump\u2019s own longest-serving chief of staff during his time in the White House, John Kelly, put his former boss under \u201cthe general definition of a fascist\u201d, the same political category as the infamous Axis leaders Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Kamala Harris openly agreed with that assessment. Dr Brian Hughes, the associate director of the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab at American University, said Trump has for years been accused of mimicking the rise to power of Hitler and Mussolini, for good reason. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to remember that fascism isn\u2019t a binary. Fascism is a process,\u201d said Hughes in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cSince the very beginning of the Trump campaign in 2015, there\u2019s been a lot of denialism and a lot of whistling past the graveyard, but the symptoms keep adding up.\u201d At the inception of his administration, Hughes pointed out, Trump instituted the Muslim ban and described Latino immigration as a sort of infestation, all classic fascistic attacks on \u201can enemy within, a group that can be targeted and scapegoated for all the problems of society\u201d. Then came the strongman tactics of trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election \u2013 a cause still pursued by many Trump acolytes who see him as a \u201cfascist imaginary\u201d, as Hughes puts it. \u201cNow we finally have stated policy goals of targeting political enemies, not just through lawfare, but also through violence and myriad other examples of plans to govern in a way that mirrors 20-century fascism,\u201d he said. Both Hitler and Mussolini similarly practiced the classic performance of screaming and hand-gesturing at rallies, threatening their enemies during their rise to power. Trump\u2019s off-the-cuff speech style, now and in previous campaigns, has become synonymous with that kind of machismo and callback to the 30s. Even while in power, Trump set the stage for his comeback and the basis for what Stanley sees as a surefire fascist state to come. \u201cThe courts will be replaced by loyalists, as we have already seen with the supreme court of the United States,\u201d he said, referring to three ultra-conservative justices Trump already installed while in power. In Nazi Germany, government officials at all levels, legal and bureaucratic, had to declare strict allegiances to the party. Since those Trump appointments, the nation\u2019s highest court delivered landmark rulings overturning abortion rights and bestowing kingly powers to the presidency, almost akin to the Third Reich or the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, who ruled over his country until 1975. Critics say LGBTQ+ rights are next on his hit list of issues for the courts, if Trump returns to power. Notably, the fascist governments of Hitler and Mussolini outlawed queer, Roma and Jewish people, disappearing those they deemed political undesirables in a series of mass killings or jailings that led up to their so-called \u201cfinal solution\u201d and the Holocaust. But the first stage of Trump\u2019s potential fascist-like state, as Stanley told the Guardian, will involve solidifying the authority of a single party, not unlike how Viktor Orb\u00e1n of Hungary (often called a \u201cneo-fascist\u201d) has eviscerated any semblance of an opposition in the former eastern bloc country. If Trump wins, Stanley said, \u201cAmerica will be a one-party state from now on\u201d forecasting that \u201cJD Vance or perhaps Donald Trump Jr\u201d will then replace Trump in the cult of personality as he ages or dies. \u201cThere will be no more meaningful federal elections,\u201d he added. Heidi Beirich, the co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), has for decades been a mainstay critic, analyst and academic authority on the American far right and said she fears the current political climate is veering towards fascism. Beirich called attention to how nationalist flirtations and pro-nativist periods in the 19th and 20th centuries have already given birth to organizations like the Ku Klux Klan, and to eugenics and the terroristic suppression of Black people all over the country in multiple eras, until the civil rights movement established legal equalities. \u201cThere was also a movement in support of the Nazi government, with groups like the American Bund prior to world war two,\u201d said Beirich, referring to a pro-Hitler and German-American political organization founded in 1936, which openly promoted Nazism. In 1939, mere months before the invasion of Poland, the Bund held a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Many critics compared that rally with Trump\u2019s own election rally in the famous arena last weekend. During the \u201clove fest\u201d, as the Republican candidate labeled it, speakers made several racist statements, including a joke about the entire island of Puerto Rico being \u201cgarbage\u201d. \u201cSo my takeaway is that anti-immigrant sentiment and race science, which is embraced by our growing white supremacist movements, have an American pedigree,\u201d said Beirich. \u201cIt is a worry that we could enter a new phase that revives this vile history.\u201d Beirich has exposed the inner workings of several American neo-Nazi groups for years and says those types of groups see the current political climate as an opportunity. \u201cThe far right is certainly in a more powerful position today than it has been in decades,\u201d she said, describing extremists who are desperately afraid of the racist great replacement theory, once promoted by Tucker Carlson on Fox News before his firing. Beirich said that \u201cwhatever happens on election day, these growing, empowered far-right movements aren\u2019t going away\u201d. \u201cThey will form a cohesive political force for years to come, particularly as demographic change inevitably transforms this country from having a white majority to no ethnic majority,\u201d she continued. Many of the neo-Nazi terrorist groups recently born in America that Beirich has tracked were also admirers of the past. Members of the Atomwaffen Division were known to worship the Third Reich and Mussolini, making a point of collecting artifacts from that era. Francesco Marone, an assistant professor at the University of Teramo and a researcher at the Italian Institute for International Political Studies, whose own country gave birth to fascism, is less concerned or convinced that Trump is a fascist as much as that his aggressive actions threaten broader western political cohesion. \u201cOn the other hand, experts can identify partial similarities between Trump and Mussolini and fascist tendencies, such as a charismatic personality, capable of promoting a cult of personality, the emphasis placed on a presumed profound decadence and humiliation of the country, racist and male chauvinist attitudes, authoritarian tendencies (but in different degrees), ultranationalism, a propensity to demonize the political opponent,\u201d he said in an emailed message. Marone says Trump is an endemic character seen across the world and isn\u2019t quite a by-definition fascist, per se. \u201cThese general traits are shared by radical rightwing leaders active in other liberal democracies in the west,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly, the growth of an illiberal radical right appears to be a problem on an international scale in our age.\u201d Read more of the Guardian\u2019s 2024 US election coverage: US election 2024 live updates: latest polls, results and news When do polls close?

Held at Depot Mayfield, the vast, disused railway station next to Manchester Piccadilly, the annual rave is a chaotic celebration of every facet of queer culture.</p> <p>From 3pm on 9 November until 4am the morning after, the dance tunnels, rowdy loft spaces and cavernous warehouse arenas of the labyrinthine venue will fill with go-go dancers, drag stars and performance artists of every body type, sexuality and gender. Rahim Redcar (FKA Christine and the Queens) and Shygirl are headlining, alongside a DJ lineup that includes Haai, Horse Meat Disco and Hannah Holland. It\u2019s part of a wave of large-scale, inclusive queer events that have launched in recent years.</p> <p>There\u2019s <a href=\"https://drumshedslondon.com/event/false-idols/\">False Idols</a>, founded by the team behind cult LGBTQ+ night Little Gay Brother and house and techno night Percolate. That will bring 15,000 people to Drumsheds, a club housed in a disused Ikea in London, in November. There\u2019s <a href=\"https://mightyhoopla.com/\">Mighty Hoopla</a>, the nostalgic pop two-dayer in south London\u2019s Brockwell Park, with 2025\u2019s headliners including Ciara, Kesha and Loreen. And then there\u2019s <a href=\"https://bodymovements.co.uk/\">Body Movements</a> in London\u2019s Southwark Park \u2013 a hip, hedonistic day rave uniting some of the capital\u2019s best queer club nights, from Big Dyke Energy to Queer House Party, as well as Glastonbury\u2019s notorious on-site gay club NYC Downlow.</p> <p>\u201cThese kinds of events change you,\u201d says Connolly. \u201cThere\u2019s a real shift when you leave \u2013 how empowered you feel, how good you feel. There\u2019s this common thread between us, but we all look and sound very different. It\u2019s a difficult world for queer people, but when we have these big spaces, we leave glowing, like we\u2019ve almost got a radiation shield.\u201d</p> <p>A DJ and artist who has run events on Manchester\u2019s queer scene for 20 years, Connolly was involved with Homobloc as a performer before joining its production team in 2023. What makes the night unique, he says, is the diversity on show: \u201cWe\u2019ve got punk rock in there, we\u2019ve got techno, drum\u2019n\u2019bass, hip-hop, house music.\u201d The setting is crucial, too. \u201cThe northernness of it means our arms are wider to bring people in than perhaps other cities,\u201d he says.</p>    <p>Homobloc launched in 2019, the brainchild of Luke Unabomber, founder of Homoelectric \u2013 the beloved, acid house-infused Manchester queer party that started in 1997 as a raucous alternative to the cheesy pop of the city\u2019s Gay Village. The idea behind Homobloc, Connolly explains, was to take that underground, anti-mainstream ethos and scale it up.</p> <p>While acts such as Honey Dijon, Jessie Ware and Confidence Man have brought big crowds, it\u2019s the non-musical performers involved who shape the event. During Homobloc\u2019s first year, a parade of dancers and drag queens marched through the venue holding protest signs parodying the hateful messages of the Westboro Baptist Church. Sophie Bee, Homobloc\u2019s creative director, recalls standing front of house with the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, that first afternoon. \u201cThere was a part where two of the performance artists on stage bent over naked and thrust. I thought to myself: \u2018Ooh!\u2019 We can be a bit naughty.\u201d</p> <p>Since then, the party has only grown bigger. Both Bee and Connolly say watching Peaches tear up the stage with punk go-go collective Fvck Pigs was a highlight. So was the \u201cunrivalled queer joy coming from the stage\u201d when Self Esteem had the crowd roaring in 2022, and last year, when US house DJ the Blessed Madonna went back-to-back with DJ Paulette. \u201cIt was such a moment,\u201d Bee recalls. \u201cThe two women of dance culture \u2013 one from Chicago and one Manchester \u2013 so intertwined with queer culture: just proper kick-ass.\u201d</p> <p>For Bee, it\u2019s the smaller moments that matter most: \u201cA few years ago, one of our trans performers took to the catwalk and, without warning, started taking her clothes off for that feeling to stand in front of 10,000 people and be like: \u2018I\u2019m fucking here.\u2019 I saw her and I just started sobbing.\u201d </p>    <p>To Connolly, the joy of these festivals is that \u201cyou\u2019re not just in a room with a speaker. There\u2019s lots of breakout areas, and there\u2019s just a lot more human interaction than you would get in a square box.\u201d He says that they\u2019re also growing in importance as nightlife venues shutter across the country. In 2023, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/jan/24/over-a-third-of-uk-grassroots-music-venues-are-loss-making-charity-finds#:~:text=There%20were%20960%20grassroots%20music,on%20their%20path%20to%20success.\">125 small music venues </a>closed or stopped putting on music across the UK. In London alone, six in 10 queer nightlife venues have shut since 2006, with high running costs and increasing noise regulations to blame.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s not that much in Manchester,\u201d Connolly says. \u201cA lot of our popular queer spaces [such as] The White Hotel and Mill Parties are pretty niche \u2013 300 capacity \u2013 and heavily booked.\u201d He thinks Homobloc \u2013 and the other big events \u2013 provide space for promoters and performers to grow audiences and for clubbers to find their community.</p> <p>Of course, not everyone agrees. Homobloc has <a href=\"https://mixmag.net/read/homobloc-criticised-cis-straight-men-manchester-high-hoops-news\">faced criticism</a> from local promoters for partnering with the mega events company the Warehouse Project. Some have argued that corporate involvement exploits the queer community and that over its five-year run it has taken profits away from queer venues and into the hands of the Warehouse Project.Connolly and Bee say that much of the ticket revenue goes to paying performers fairly, and that the Warehouse Project\u2019s infrastructure is essential for logistics. \u201cWithout their support, we couldn\u2019t create something this big,\u201d says Connolly.</p> <p>Bee adds: \u201cI\u2019ve got a personal statement \u2013 and this isn\u2019t the official Homobloc statement: doesn\u2019t our community deserve a global stage? We\u2019ve fought so hard to be seen, and I\u2019m passionate about that.\u201d</p>    <p>The Warehouse Project is also, like many formerly independent promoters and more than 35 venues in the UK, majority-owned by Live Nation-Gaiety Holdings. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund is reported to be a 5.7% passive shareholder in Live Nation. Local promoters, such as High Hoops \u2013 who pulled out of working on Homobloc in 2021 \u2013 have raised concerns about this link to a country where same-sex relationships are punishable by death.</p> <p>\u201cMy DIY and activist background and nature is that we can only change things from within,\u201d says Bee. \u201cWe\u2019ve had internal discussions, and have met as a community,\u201d says Connolly. \u201cWe\u2019re still talking about it and kind of figuring it out.\u201d</p> <p>They point out that this year Homobloc has introduced low-income tickets priced at \u00a325, and the event continues to support LGBTQ+ charities, including the Proud Trust, LGBT Foundation and George House Trust. Over the years, Homobloc has donated more than \u00a3137,000 to these causes.</p> <p>Looking ahead, Connolly hopes to create a Homobloc camping festival. \u201cBecause 13 hours isn\u2019t enough. I want to wake up with you and continue that energy. I think 2026 is a year when the parameters of Homobloc can move.\u201d</p> <p>For now, he and Bee are eagerly awaiting this year\u2019s festival. Bee grins: \u201cI always love the last tune on the main stage \u2013 there\u2019s loads of chaos, streamers, balloons, bits of broken tech I\u2019m going to get in so much trouble for on Monday morning, but it\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.homobloc.co.uk/\">Homobloc</a> is at Depot Mayfield, Manchester, on 9 November.</em></p>",

Bee grins: \u201cI always love the last tune on the main stage \u2013 there\u2019s loads of chaos, streamers, balloons, bits of broken tech I\u2019m going to get in so much trouble for on Monday morning, but it\u2019s worth it.\u201d Homobloc is at Depot Mayfield, Manchester, on 9 November.",

      "body": "<p>Here is a new adaptation of Juan Rulfo\u2019s 1955 magic-realist novel that later inspired Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, among others; judging by the non-linear tangle of life and death, lost loves and shattered ideals, you wonder if it wasn\u2019t also an influence on the fractured films of the 00s Mexican new wave written by Guillermo Arriaga. With Amores Perros cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto serving as director here, this fragmentation is at first a tough introduction to the story\u2019s teeming ghost town, then thrilling, then finally a problem.</p> <p>Juan Preciado (Tenoch Huerta) has made a promise to his mother on her deathbed: that he will return to the fateful <em>pueblo</em> of Comala to finally meet his father Pedro P\u00e1ramo. But who is P\u00e1ramo? \u201cA living resentment,\u201d says the first wayfarer Juan encounters, before directing him to lodge with local innkeeper Eduviges (Dolores Heredia). After showing Juan to a bare attic room, she says that she has heard from his mother \u2013 the first sign that this ashen town is in truth a purgatory filled with wandering souls. The one thing they all have in common is a tale connected to the tyrannical landowner Pedro P\u00e1ramo and his estate, La Media Luna.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRq7niwEgSM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nRq7niwEgSM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>After a disorientating first half-hour that both asks us to get cosy in this stygian gloom, while throwing out flashbacks to the young, spoilt P\u00e1ramo, the storytelling mode slowly coheres. Cycling between a variety of vassals in P\u00e1ramo\u2019s orbit, the time slippages, perspective shifts and suddenly exposed half-truths are fitting ways of describing the unstable terrain of late 19th-century rural Mexico; a feudal, power-riven hellhole over which P\u00e1ramo exercises <em>droit de seigneur</em>, but is paradoxically chasing his own lost innocence.</p> <p>The multiplicity gradually overwhelms this version, though. We don\u2019t spend enough time with P\u00e1ramo\u2019s bluff foreman Fulgor (Hector Kotsifakis), mendicant-turned-pimp Dorotea (Giovanna Zacar\u00edas) or any other character to entirely grasp what they represent in this fresco of spiritual degradation. And an underpowered Manuel Garc\u00eda-Rulfo seems miscast as the black hole at its centre; he captures the sad absence that is P\u00e1ramo, but not his wanton autocratic side. Strangely, given Prieto\u2019s visual acumen, the film is also a bit bland visually, bar a flashy prologue kicked off by the camera sinking into the bowels of the earth. But the story has enough residual power to deliver a dark night of the Mexican soul nonetheless.</p> <p>\u2022 Pedro P\u00e1ramo is on Netflix from 6 November.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 November 2024 to correct the spelling of Comala.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Here is a new adaptation of Juan Rulfo\u2019s 1955 magic-realist novel that later inspired Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, among others; judging by the non-linear tangle of life and death, lost loves and shattered ideals, you wonder if it wasn\u2019t also an influence on the fractured films of the 00s Mexican new wave written by Guillermo Arriaga. With Amores Perros cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto serving as director here, this fragmentation is at first a tough introduction to the story\u2019s teeming ghost town, then thrilling, then finally a problem. Juan Preciado (Tenoch Huerta) has made a promise to his mother on her deathbed: that he will return to the fateful pueblo of Comala to finally meet his father Pedro P\u00e1ramo. But who is P\u00e1ramo? \u201cA living resentment,\u201d says the first wayfarer Juan encounters, before directing him to lodge with local innkeeper Eduviges (Dolores Heredia). After showing Juan to a bare attic room, she says that she has heard from his mother \u2013 the first sign that this ashen town is in truth a purgatory filled with wandering souls. The one thing they all have in common is a tale connected to the tyrannical landowner Pedro P\u00e1ramo and his estate, La Media Luna. After a disorientating first half-hour that both asks us to get cosy in this stygian gloom, while throwing out flashbacks to the young, spoilt P\u00e1ramo, the storytelling mode slowly coheres. Cycling between a variety of vassals in P\u00e1ramo\u2019s orbit, the time slippages, perspective shifts and suddenly exposed half-truths are fitting ways of describing the unstable terrain of late 19th-century rural Mexico; a feudal, power-riven hellhole over which P\u00e1ramo exercises droit de seigneur, but is paradoxically chasing his own lost innocence. The multiplicity gradually overwhelms this version, though. We don\u2019t spend enough time with P\u00e1ramo\u2019s bluff foreman Fulgor (Hector Kotsifakis), mendicant-turned-pimp Dorotea (Giovanna Zacar\u00edas) or any other character to entirely grasp what they represent in this fresco of spiritual degradation. And an underpowered Manuel Garc\u00eda-Rulfo seems miscast as the black hole at its centre; he captures the sad absence that is P\u00e1ramo, but not his wanton autocratic side. Strangely, given Prieto\u2019s visual acumen, the film is also a bit bland visually, bar a flashy prologue kicked off by the camera sinking into the bowels of the earth. But the story has enough residual power to deliver a dark night of the Mexican soul nonetheless. \u2022 Pedro P\u00e1ramo is on Netflix from 6 November. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 November 2024 to correct the spelling of Comala.",

It was a conversation with a very prominent, highly respected Black British figure, who agreed to be interviewed, and then, recalling trauma, withdrew. \u201cI had such an awful time when I took the honour,\u201d they said. \u201cI can\u2019t go through that again.\u201d Does this matter? It\u2019s not the sharp-end discrimination that denies minorities their fair share of jobs and housing. Zephaniah, friendly and characteristically robust, took the view that wide acclaim was nice but, all said, appreciation from and within his own community was enough for him. I respected that. But still I think \u2013 and I\u2019ve argued here \u2013 that broader society should have a way to thank those whose work and ideas help it function, keep it safe, make us think. You can argue about the best system for doing that, who controls it and how it is supervised, but the concept is a valuable one in a democracy of citizens. It must be a system equally accessible to all, not just to an elite that rewards the elite, not least because a successful, diverse society needs many and various contributions. If it takes a monarch, who sits on a gilded throne by dint of birth, to bring us closer to a better mechanism for rewarding the acumen of those whose propellant has been merit, so be it.

Surely those distinctions stopped making sense in the 1960s, around the time Mick Jagger perfected his mockney accent? That cringey affectation is going stronger than ever, incidentally: social media is <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/comment/2024/03/posh-privileged-fraudulent-meet-slangster\">full of posh youths</a> pretending to be \u201croadmen\u201d (\u201ca young person who spends a lot of time on the streets and may use or sell drugs, or cause trouble\u201d, the Cambridge dictionary explains, sounding an awful lot like posters on my NextDoor app).</p> <p>The giant pit of words that is the internet means we live radically less linguistically siloed lives, too. Perhaps this study will finally bury U and non-U. Of course, it won\u2019t stop us judging each other based on how we talk; plenty of words and phrases make me clutch my pearls in horror. I have started compiling a list of my most irredeemable for 2024: Substack, sleepmaxxing, fridgescape, \u201cpassionate about content creation\u201d and microbiome. Also dolphin (more a&nbsp;lifelong prejudice than a 2024 bugbear).

Then there\u2019s the other thing we all sit on: we call it the loo or toilet indiscriminately now, irrespective of where we went to school. It\u2019s amazing that U and non-U, the 1950s set of linguistic class signifiers popularised by Nancy Mitford, is still knocking around. Surely those distinctions stopped making sense in the 1960s, around the time Mick Jagger perfected his mockney accent? That cringey affectation is going stronger than ever, incidentally: social media is full of posh youths pretending to be \u201croadmen\u201d (\u201ca young person who spends a lot of time on the streets and may use or sell drugs, or cause trouble\u201d, the Cambridge dictionary explains, sounding an awful lot like posters on my NextDoor app). The giant pit of words that is the internet means we live radically less linguistically siloed lives, too. Perhaps this study will finally bury U and non-U. Of course, it won\u2019t stop us judging each other based on how we talk; plenty of words and phrases make me clutch my pearls in horror. I have started compiling a list of my most irredeemable for 2024: Substack, sleepmaxxing, fridgescape, \u201cpassionate about content creation\u201d and microbiome. Also dolphin (more a lifelong prejudice than a 2024 bugbear). Maybe this is what a truly classless Britain will look like: everyone arbitrarily judging everyone else\u2019s vocabulary. \u2022 Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>Shortly before America\u2019s first presidential election since the fall of Roe v Wade, I want to tell you the story of Amanda Zurawski, a bright light in the center of a perfect, horrendous storm.</p> <p>A little over two years ago, Zurawski was 18 weeks pregnant with her first child, a child she and her husband had conceived after a year and a half of fertility treatments. When she started leaking fluid and sought medical help, her doctors told her there was no chance the fetus would survive. But Zurawski lives in Texas, a state with some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country: in May of the previous year, the governor, Greg Abbott, had signed into law the Texas Heartbeat Act, also known as SB8, which makes performing abortions after detection of embryonic or fetal cardiac activity, usually at six weeks, illegal. That was on top of several existing statutes. Then, in June 2022, Roe fell.</p> <p>And so Zurawski\u2019s doctors told her that by the letter of the law \u2013 as far as they understood it; more on that later \u2013 in order to get the medical care she so desperately needed, either her daughter\u2019s heart would have to stop, or her health would have to devolve into a \u201clife-threatening situation\u201d, something Zurawski has <a href=\"https://wearethemeteor.com/texas-abortion-ban-stopped-doctors-helping-woman-miscarrying/\">previous called</a> \u201cthe most horrific version of a staring contest: whose life would end first?

So she went home to grieve her impending loss and brace for what might come \u2013 during which time, Texas\u2019s total abortion trigger ban went into effect, which made performing an abortion punishable by life in prison. And there Zurawski sat, waiting.</p> <p>The next day, she developed sepsis \u2013 a condition her doctors felt was extreme enough to protect them from unintentionally violating the new law, allowing them to induce labor \u2013 and after three days in the ICU, she emerged from the experience having almost died, with her own future fertility compromised, and galvanized to make a change about the inhumane laws.</p> <p>\u201cI admittedly didn\u2019t realize the ways in which an abortion truly is just healthcare,\u201d Zurawski told me this week when I reached her by phone during her early morning walk with her sheepadoodle, Millie, in Austin, where she lives with her husband, Josh. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine that I would ever need or want one, since I was desperately trying to have a baby.\u201d</p> <p>The first moment abortion laws and her own fertility journey intersected was early on in the IVF process. The likelihood of a multiples pregnancy increases when using IVF, but as she is not able to carry multiples, her doctor had discussed the possibility of needing to perform selective reduction surgery if more than one embryo implanted, something that is currently illegal in Texas.</p> <p>\u201cSo I was aware that these laws could affect us, but not from the perspective that I would need it to save my life, and be denied healthcare,\u201d she told me. When she found herself in the unimaginable situation of being turned away from the hospital by doctors who wanted to help her, but weren\u2019t sure they could, her eyes opened, and she and Josh vowed to fight.</p> <p>Zurawski became the lead plaintiff in the landmark case, Zurawski v Texas, which sued the state of Texas to clarify the \u201cmedical emergency\u201d exception in the law \u2013 a riveting and harrowing <a href=\"https://www.zurawskivtexas.com/\">new documentary</a> about the case follows Zurawski and two fellow plaintiffs through the legal fight \u2013 and soon found herself catapulted on to the national stage.

Among the common toxic substances used in the 8,500 products checked by ChemForward, a non-profit that promotes transparency around beauty ingredients, are chemicals linked to hormone disruption, cancer, lung irritation and other health issues. The report will be used as the foundation for a new industry effort to fill information gaps around the chemicals it uses, remove dangerous substances from supply chains, and advocate for shifts to safer alternatives. The high number of unknown toxicological profiles highlights the challenges in avoiding dangerous chemicals in cosmetics and personal products, but there is optimism that it can be done, in part because the number of individual chemicals essential to the products is far below 318,000. \u201cYou can really winnow down the number of chemicals that are required for the essential function of products to a manageable level and that\u2019s why there\u2019s optimism,\u201d says Bill Walsh, director of the Safer Chemistry Impact Fund that is helping fund the effort. Personal care and cosmetic companies are also attempting to get ahead of regulations instead of always reacting. Public health advocates have long pushed for stricter regulation of toxic chemicals used in personal care products. While regulations at the federal level are limited to a small number of substances, some states in recent years have stepped up regulations on products that contain PFAS \u201cforever chemicals\u201d, phthalates and other toxic compounds. The new report gleaned data from several chemical databases, such as the European Chemicals Agency. It will be turned into a \u201ccentralized repository\u201d of hazard data accessible to personal care and beauty producers.

      "body": "<p>Joseph Rykwert, who has died aged 98, was a historian and critic of architecture of exceptional intellect, cultural breadth and distinctive outlook. His books and his teaching changed the understanding of his discipline and helped to move the design and planning of cities and buildings away from the functionalist mindset that dominated postwar building. In 2014 he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/sep/18/riba-gold-medal-joseph-rykwert\">awarded</a> Britain\u2019s leading honour for architecture, the Royal Gold Medal, one of a very few times that it has been given to a writer rather than a practitioner.</p> <p>Rykwert\u2019s first book, The Idea of a Town (1963), by exploring the rituals that underlay the founding of ancient cities, sought to restore the importance of such things as memory, feeling, intuition and instinct in the making of the places where human beings live. It was an important part of a wider reaction to technocratic approaches that were causing widespread destruction in cities across the world. It is now commonplace for developers and planners to talk about \u201cplacemaking\u201d, by which they mean the ways in which architecture and landscape work together to make social urban spaces, a concept that owes much to Rykwert\u2019s belief that buildings should not be considered in isolation but as part of the fabric of a city. </p> <p>His other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/dec/09/history.society\">books</a> included On Adam\u2019s House in Paradise (1972), on architects\u2019 enduring fascination with the idea of a primitive hut at one with nature, and The First Moderns (1980) \u2013 his favourite \u2013 which revealed the roots of 20th-century ideas of modernity in thinkers and architects 200 years earlier.</p>    <p>In all his work Rykwert moved readily between architecture, philosophy, art and other disciplines, aided by his wide erudition and an impressive library that he started building as a student. He was motivated by his certainty that the design of buildings is always part of a wider culture, and by his passion for the places that make a city flourish, whether a remembered street in pre-war Poland or a forum in ancient Etruria. He was, as the writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/dec/29/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\">Susan Sontag</a> put it, an \u201cingeniously speculative historian and critic of architecture \u2013 of that is, the forms (in the most concrete sense) of civilisation.\u201d</p> <p>The many architects whom he inspired and influenced include the Stirling prize winners <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/07/i-faked-it-at-the-beginning-david-chipperfield-on-his-rise-from-shop-designer-to-starchitect\">Sir David Chipperfield</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/mar/10/new-river-wing-old-court-clare-college-cambridge-review-witherford-watson-mann-a-perfect-fit\">Witherford Watson Mann</a>, Eric Parry, Patrick Lynch, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/mar/20/james-stirling-tate-britain-drawings\">Sir James Stirling </a>(the giant of British architecture after whom the prize was named). </p> <p>Rykwert\u2019s demeanour was gentle and civilised \u2013 \u201cthe sort of great-uncle I would have liked to have\u201d, as one former student, the artist Richard Wentworth, now puts it, who \u201calways imparted a general sense of mischief\u201d. This character was all the more remarkable for the traumas of his childhood, in which he and his family had to flee for their lives from the advancing German armies. Many of his relatives died in the Holocaust. </p> <p>Joseph was born in Warsaw, the son of Elizabeth (nee Melup), and Szymon Rykwert. His father, a railways engineer, was ruined after the great crash of 1929, but worked his way back to prosperity. In September 1939, when the Wehrmacht invaded Poland, the Rykwerts escaped via Lithuania, Latvia and Sweden to Britain. Joseph went to Charterhouse, a \u201cplunge\u201d in his words \u201cinto the wholly alien world\u201d of an English boarding school. His father died of a stroke early in Joseph\u2019s time there, leaving his mother \u201cskimping\u201d to pay his fees. He went to the Bartlett School of Architecture, which was evacuated to Cambridge in wartime, then the Architectural Association in London.</p> <p>He started to write, studiously, taking two years to complete his first book review for the Burlington Magazine. He wanted to work for \u201cthe London architect I most admired\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/30/architecture-erno-goldfinger-high-rise-apartment-south-london\">Ern\u00f6 Goldfinger</a>, but was put off by the measly pay on offer \u2013 30 shillings a week \u2013 and went instead to the pioneer British modernists Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew, who paid five times as much. Rykwert later decided to refuse a job offer in the Paris studio of the most famous architect of the 20th century, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/sep/11/le-corbusier-india-architecture-1965\">Le Corbusier</a>, who paid nothing. Eventually, although his built works included a fur-lined nightclub and a house in Chelsea, Rykwert\u2019s writing and teaching would take over from designing buildings.</p> <p>In both London and Paris, which he visited as a young man, the postwar years were for him a time of \u201cexhilaration and easy familiarity\u201d in which \u201cpeople of great intellectual and professional distinction ... seemed prepared to accept an obscure and impoverished youth as a partner in dialogue.\u201d From the age of 18 he exchanged ideas with the future Nobel prizewinner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/aug/07/biography.features\">Elias Canetti</a>.

Summer fares were down by an average 7% as Ryanair cut prices to keep its planes full, carrying 9% more passengers from April to September this year than last. However, delays to delivery of its new 737 planes left the no-frills carrier \u201cover-scheduled, over-crewed and over-costed\u201d, according to the chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary. The airline reported profits of \u20ac1.8bn (\u00a31.5bn) for the six months to the end of September, 18% lower than the same period the previous year. It said the decline was partly driven by pressure on consumer spending amid higher interest rates and efforts to offset higher living costs \u2013 but it also cut fares to win market share and carry a record 115 million passengers over the half-year period. Fares were likely to climb back towards previous levels over the winter, Ryanair said. O\u2019Leary said that the continued problems at the US plane manufacturer Boeing meant that Ryanair would cut its growth plans for next year, with only 172 of 300 Boeing 737-Max-10 planes on order now delivered. He said: \u201cWe now expect our remaining nine Q3 deliveries to slip into Q4 due to recent Boeing strikes.\u201d He added that compensation from Boeing for late deliveries did not make up for more than 5 million extra passengers it could have carried. \u201cWhile we continue to work with Boeing leadership to accelerate aircraft deliveries ahead of peak summer 2025, the risk of further delivery delays remains high,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe it is therefore sensible to moderate Ryanair\u2019s full-year traffic growth target to 210 million passengers (previously 215 million) to reflect these delivery delays, as we wish to avoid being over-scheduled, over-crewed and over-costed as we were [this summer].\u201d Boeing workers in the US are voting this week on a new pay deal that if ratified would put an end to weeks of strikes. Ryanair has already said it expects to cut its UK capacity by up to 10% in response to a rise in air passenger duty announced at last week\u2019s budget, which will take the rate on short-haul international departures up from \u00a313 to \u00a315 a passenger.

      "bodyText": "On a Thursday evening last June, I found myself standing in a packed room in the House of Commons. The space had been turned into a temporary art gallery showcasing work made by a selection of IPP prisoners \u2013 the acronym stands for imprisonment for public protection \u2013 who had spent years in prison beyond their sentences or remained there, under the terms of the long-abolished indeterminate sentence, which had by then collectively been agreed upon as a point of national disgrace. Much of the art was, unsurprisingly, darkly hued and themed, a mesh of heavy greys and nightmare landscapes. Donna Mooney \u2013 whose brother Tommy Nicol took his own life in prison in 2015, having lost hope of ever being released after serving two extra years over his four-year minimum tariff for a car robbery \u2013 had given a short, understated address. Words to the effect that the renewed interest in IPP was welcome, but there were still hundreds of people lingering in prisons across England and Wales. Her speech was greeted with the applause it deserved. I remember noting how impressively cool her performance was, and how hard won that control must have been. These indeterminate sentences were brought into law in 2005 under the terms of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, having been cooked up in the earliest years of the millennium as part of the broader New Labour crusade to be \u201ctough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\u201d.

It goes without saying that a tardy start did nothing to help City Of Troy\u2019s cause, but the pace in the 14\u2011runner race on Saturday was ridiculously strong \u2013 44.96sec for the first half-mile, the fastest in the Classic\u2019s 41-year history. It was being set up for a closer, and Sierra Leone, the eventual winner, went into the first turn a half-length behind City Of Troy, before emerging around a length in front.</p> \n<p>What happened next told the real story of City Of Troy\u2019s race. With nearly three-quarters of a mile to travel, Sierra Leone was up to cruising speed and had effectively already started the run that would carry him to the lead at the top of the stretch. He made ground steadily and smoothly all the way down the back, and left City Of Troy toiling in his wake.</p> \n<p>City Of Troy could have trapped like a greyhound, but the bottom line is simply that he did not act on the dirt. He did not like the kickback, and could not, or would not, reach the high cruising speed that carried him to a front\u2011running success in the International Stakes in August.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"01f6c32a-2069-4fdf-bb10-4911d1a93678\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Southwell</b> <b>11.40 </b>Bernard Spierpoint<b> 12.15 </b>At No Time<b> 12.50 </b>Swinging London<b> 1.25 </b>Crown\u2019s Lady<b> 2.00 </b>Harswell Ruby (nap) <b>2.35 </b>Midnight City<b> 3.10 </b>Climate Action<b> 3.45 </b>First Dynasty.</p>\n    <p><b>Newcastle 2.10 </b>Violeta<b> 2.45 </b>Jkr Cobbler <b>3.20 </b>Fort George<b> 3.55 </b>Pivotal Days<b> 4.30 </b>Looking For Lynda<b> 5.05 </b>Strong Johnson<b> 5.40 </b>Falcon Nine<b> 6.15 </b>Urban Dandy.</p>\n    <p><b>Newbury 12.30 </b>King William Rufus<b> 1.05 </b>Pure Carbon<b> 1.40 </b>Rock My Way<b> 2.17 </b>Listentoyourheart<b> 2.52 </b>Monmiral<b> 3.27 </b>I\u2019d Like To Know<b> 4.02 </b>Brookside La.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Ludlow 12.40 </b>Thank You Ma\u2019am<b> 1.15 </b>Usuario Amigo <b>1.50 </b>Ned Cash<b> 2.25 </b>Sain Et Sauf<b> 3.00 </b>Wendigo<b> 3.35 </b>Inflexible<b> 4.10 </b>Frontier Prince.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Chelmsford 4.55 </b>Make Love<b> 5.30 </b>Lady Wingalong<b> 6.00 </b>Capricorn King<b> 6.30 </b>Aegean Prince<b> 7.00 </b>Born A Rebel<b> 7.30 </b>Twilight Fun<b> 8.00 </b>Blackjack (nb)&nbsp;<b>8.30 </b>Expensive Queen</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>O\u2019Brien\u2019s record with runners in the Classic on dirt is now 0-16 but, on the basis that you learn more from failure than you do from success, this latest reverse is sure to inform his next attempt to break his Classic hoodoo.</p> \n<p>We know, after all, that it is possible to win the Classic with a turf horse making his debut on the surface, because Andr\u00e9 Fabre did just that with Arcangues in 1993.

      "bodyText": "The most predictable line in the aftermath of the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic on Saturday was the one where Aidan O\u2019Brien blamed himself for City Of Troy\u2019s failure to run to form \u2013 or, let\u2019s face it, to run any kind of race at all \u2013 in the meeting\u2019s showpiece event. \u201cHe lost it at the start and obviously I didn\u2019t have him prepared to come out quick enough,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cWe thought we did, but we didn\u2019t. He missed it and left Ryan [Moore] with no chance, really.\u201d It was textbook O\u2019Brien and, as it often is, overly self-critical. It goes without saying that a tardy start did nothing to help City Of Troy\u2019s cause, but the pace in the 14\u2011runner race on Saturday was ridiculously strong \u2013 44.96sec for the first half-mile, the fastest in the Classic\u2019s 41-year history. It was being set up for a closer, and Sierra Leone, the eventual winner, went into the first turn a half-length behind City Of Troy, before emerging around a length in front. What happened next told the real story of City Of Troy\u2019s race. With nearly three-quarters of a mile to travel, Sierra Leone was up to cruising speed and had effectively already started the run that would carry him to the lead at the top of the stretch. He made ground steadily and smoothly all the way down the back, and left City Of Troy toiling in his wake. City Of Troy could have trapped like a greyhound, but the bottom line is simply that he did not act on the dirt. He did not like the kickback, and could not, or would not, reach the high cruising speed that carried him to a front\u2011running success in the International Stakes in August. O\u2019Brien\u2019s record with runners in the Classic on dirt is now 0-16 but, on the basis that you learn more from failure than you do from success, this latest reverse is sure to inform his next attempt to break his Classic hoodoo. We know, after all, that it is possible to win the Classic with a turf horse making his debut on the surface, because Andr\u00e9 Fabre did just that with Arcangues in 1993. But Arcangues was a five-year-old with 15 starts in the book when he won at Santa Anita. He had also had just two (unsuccessful) starts since May before heading to the US. To maximise his chance of winning a Classic, O\u2019Brien probably needs a top-class, dirt-bred four\u2011year\u2011old whose whole season is built around the Breeders\u2019 Cup, perhaps including a previous run on the surface \u2013 and how many of those is he likely to get when top-class European racing is entirely on turf and his owners\u2019 business plan is built around three\u2011year\u2011old Classic winners? But past form suggests that O\u2019Brien and \u201cthe lads\u201d in the Coolmore syndicate will not stop trying if they think they have a chance. They could have run City Of Troy in the Turf, but tilted at the bigger, bolder prize instead. They gambled and lost, but most punters would say fair play to them for trying.",

      "body": "<p>It is a relatively well-known fact that the author of the bestselling and most widely known Nordic noir crime series of all time never got to witness his own success. Swedish novelist Stieg Larsson died of a sudden heart attack 20 years ago this week, aged only 50, before the publication of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and the Millennium trilogy that followed.</p> <p>What is less well known is that on the day of his death (9 November 2004), Larsson was due to give a lecture on<em> </em>the Nazis\u2019 November pogrom at the headquarters of the Workers\u2019 Educational Association in Stockholm. Kristallnacht,<em> </em>\u201cthe night of broken glass\u201d, was an important date in Larsson\u2019s calendar, which he commemorated every year. To him, it epitomised the abyss of far-right extremism he spent his life fighting.</p> <p>Larsson\u2019s life as an antifascist activist has been increasingly overlooked in the wake of his books\u2019 phenomenal global success. One of Sweden\u2019s most lucrative literary exports, the Millennium series has sold more than 100m copies across its various titles, according to publisher Norstedts. The novels have since been adapted into a number of Swedish TV films, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/16/the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-review\">Hollywood blockbuster starring Daniel Craig</a>, and expanded into two further trilogies by two other authors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/04/stieg-larsson-partner-eva-gabrielsson\">Stieg Larsson\u2019s partner: \u2018It\u2019s odd to have to prove our life together existed\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAnd yet, the trilogy is only one episode in Stieg\u2019s journey through the world, and it certainly isn\u2019t his life\u2019s work\u201d, his life partner, Eva Gabrielsson, wrote back in 2011 in her memoir. Gabrielsson refers to the \u201cStieg of the \u2018Millennium industry\u2019\u201d as being created after his death. The Larsson she knew was an unwavering antifascist \u2013 a deeply rooted conviction that shines through passage after passage of his page-turning crime thrillers.</p> <p>Two decades on, the novels read like a gloomy premonition of Sweden\u2019s political landscape to come, with the far-right Sweden Democrats a de facto part of the governing coalition since 2022. Larsson exposed the undemocratic underbelly of a country usually associated with Scandinavian exceptionalism rather than murderous Nazis. It was a side of Swedish society he knew all too well as a journalist.</p> <p>In The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, a suspenseful whodunnit set on a fictional Swedish island inhabited by a wealthy industrialist family, Nazi pasts are never far beneath the surface of the plot. The Vanger brothers \u2013 Richard, Harald and Greger \u2013 were all members of the extreme right organisation New Sweden, with Harald becoming a \u201ckey contributor to the hibernating Swedish fascist movement\u201d. The investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist later finds photos of Greger with Sven Olov Lindholm, a Swedish Nazi leader in the 1940s. And the fascist ideology of Richard \u2013 grandfather of the missing Harriet and her vicious brother Martin \u2013 led him to the Finnish trenches in the second world war.</p>    <p>In the sequel, The Girl Who Played With Fire, we find the biker gang Svavelsj\u00f6 MC (whose logo features a Celtic cross, a symbol common among white supremacy groups) at the centre of a sex trafficking ring. The gang is well connected with the organised extreme right: its number two, Sonny Nieminen, has had dealings with neo-Nazi groups such as the Aryan Brotherhood and the Nordic Resistance Movement while in prison. Lisbeth Salander\u2019s nemesis and, as it turns out, brother \u2013 a giant brute who feels no pain called Ronald Niedermann \u2013 was part of a skinhead gang in the 1980s in Hamburg, we are told; it\u2019s a nod to a nascent far-right subculture in Germany responsible for arson attacks and murders.</p> <p>And in Larsson\u2019s final novel, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets\u2019 Nest, Blomkvist and Salander expose a shadowy clique within Swedish intelligence called \u201cthe Section\u201d, comprised of members of the extreme right Democratic Alliance. \u201cWithin the Section this was no obstacle,\u201d we learn. \u201cThe Section had in fact been instrumental in the very formation of the group.\u201d</p> <p>While the Millennium trilogy touches on many themes, especially violence against women (the original Swedish title Larsson insisted on for the first novel translates as \u201cMen who hate women\u201d), Larsson condemned the Swedish far right\u2019s influence at all levels of society.</p> <p>These convictions were rooted in his biography. His grandfather, with whom he grew up with in the icy north of Sweden, was an anti-Nazi communist imprisoned in an internment camp during the second world war. The grandfather would recount the horrors of the November pogrom, leaving a lasting impression on the young Larsson, himself a committed activist, first in the anti-Vietnam war movement, then in Maoist and Trotskyist circles. But it was Larsson\u2019s commitment against the far right that would shape his politics for the bulk of his life.</p>    <p>In 1979, Larsson joined the Swedish news agency Tidningarnas Telegrambyr\u00e5, where he spent the next 20 years of his modest career as a low-level journalist. But as rightwing extremists began robbing banks, stealing weapons and murdering people in Sweden in the mid-1980s, Larsson became the agency\u2019s go-to expert.</p> <p>From 1983, he began writing for the British antifascist magazine Searchlight<em> </em>as a Stockholm correspondent. In 1991 he co-authored a Swedish-language book on rightwing extremism. And over the years he penned numerous reports and articles on contemporary antisemitism and the far right for organisations and institutes in Israel, Belgium and France.</p> <p>A pivotal moment came in 1995. Larsson co-founded the Expo Foundation, which publishes a quarterly magazine on racism, antisemitism and the far right to this day. By 1999, it had become his day job.

      "bodyText": "It is a relatively well-known fact that the author of the bestselling and most widely known Nordic noir crime series of all time never got to witness his own success. Swedish novelist Stieg Larsson died of a sudden heart attack 20 years ago this week, aged only 50, before the publication of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and the Millennium trilogy that followed. What is less well known is that on the day of his death (9 November 2004), Larsson was due to give a lecture on the Nazis\u2019 November pogrom at the headquarters of the Workers\u2019 Educational Association in Stockholm. Kristallnacht, \u201cthe night of broken glass\u201d, was an important date in Larsson\u2019s calendar, which he commemorated every year. To him, it epitomised the abyss of far-right extremism he spent his life fighting. Larsson\u2019s life as an antifascist activist has been increasingly overlooked in the wake of his books\u2019 phenomenal global success. One of Sweden\u2019s most lucrative literary exports, the Millennium series has sold more than 100m copies across its various titles, according to publisher Norstedts. The novels have since been adapted into a number of Swedish TV films, a Hollywood blockbuster starring Daniel Craig, and expanded into two further trilogies by two other authors. \u201cAnd yet, the trilogy is only one episode in Stieg\u2019s journey through the world, and it certainly isn\u2019t his life\u2019s work\u201d, his life partner, Eva Gabrielsson, wrote back in 2011 in her memoir. Gabrielsson refers to the \u201cStieg of the \u2018Millennium industry\u2019\u201d as being created after his death. The Larsson she knew was an unwavering antifascist \u2013 a deeply rooted conviction that shines through passage after passage of his page-turning crime thrillers. Two decades on, the novels read like a gloomy premonition of Sweden\u2019s political landscape to come, with the far-right Sweden Democrats a de facto part of the governing coalition since 2022. Larsson exposed the undemocratic underbelly of a country usually associated with Scandinavian exceptionalism rather than murderous Nazis. It was a side of Swedish society he knew all too well as a journalist. In The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, a suspenseful whodunnit set on a fictional Swedish island inhabited by a wealthy industrialist family, Nazi pasts are never far beneath the surface of the plot. The Vanger brothers \u2013 Richard, Harald and Greger \u2013 were all members of the extreme right organisation New Sweden, with Harald becoming a \u201ckey contributor to the hibernating Swedish fascist movement\u201d. The investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist later finds photos of Greger with Sven Olov Lindholm, a Swedish Nazi leader in the 1940s. And the fascist ideology of Richard \u2013 grandfather of the missing Harriet and her vicious brother Martin \u2013 led him to the Finnish trenches in the second world war. In the sequel, The Girl Who Played With Fire, we find the biker gang Svavelsj\u00f6 MC (whose logo features a Celtic cross, a symbol common among white supremacy groups) at the centre of a sex trafficking ring. The gang is well connected with the organised extreme right: its number two, Sonny Nieminen, has had dealings with neo-Nazi groups such as the Aryan Brotherhood and the Nordic Resistance Movement while in prison. Lisbeth Salander\u2019s nemesis and, as it turns out, brother \u2013 a giant brute who feels no pain called Ronald Niedermann \u2013 was part of a skinhead gang in the 1980s in Hamburg, we are told; it\u2019s a nod to a nascent far-right subculture in Germany responsible for arson attacks and murders. And in Larsson\u2019s final novel, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets\u2019 Nest, Blomkvist and Salander expose a shadowy clique within Swedish intelligence called \u201cthe Section\u201d, comprised of members of the extreme right Democratic Alliance. \u201cWithin the Section this was no obstacle,\u201d we learn. \u201cThe Section had in fact been instrumental in the very formation of the group.\u201d While the Millennium trilogy touches on many themes, especially violence against women (the original Swedish title Larsson insisted on for the first novel translates as \u201cMen who hate women\u201d), Larsson condemned the Swedish far right\u2019s influence at all levels of society. These convictions were rooted in his biography. His grandfather, with whom he grew up with in the icy north of Sweden, was an anti-Nazi communist imprisoned in an internment camp during the second world war. The grandfather would recount the horrors of the November pogrom, leaving a lasting impression on the young Larsson, himself a committed activist, first in the anti-Vietnam war movement, then in Maoist and Trotskyist circles. But it was Larsson\u2019s commitment against the far right that would shape his politics for the bulk of his life. In 1979, Larsson joined the Swedish news agency Tidningarnas Telegrambyr\u00e5, where he spent the next 20 years of his modest career as a low-level journalist. But as rightwing extremists began robbing banks, stealing weapons and murdering people in Sweden in the mid-1980s, Larsson became the agency\u2019s go-to expert. From 1983, he began writing for the British antifascist magazine Searchlight as a Stockholm correspondent. In 1991 he co-authored a Swedish-language book on rightwing extremism. And over the years he penned numerous reports and articles on contemporary antisemitism and the far right for organisations and institutes in Israel, Belgium and France. A pivotal moment came in 1995. Larsson co-founded the Expo Foundation, which publishes a quarterly magazine on racism, antisemitism and the far right to this day. By 1999, it had become his day job. It was a calling that came at great personal cost, landing him on neo-Nazi hitlists. He received bullets by post. Colleagues were targeted through shootings or car bombs. According to Gabrielsson, it was for security reasons that they did not marry, leaving her without inheritance rights under Swedish law. \u201cStieg was a nerd at heart, but there was a certain machismo to covering the far right in the 90s,\u201d says Daniel Poohl, head of the Expo Foundation since 2005. \u201cIt was men researching dangerous other men and sometimes that meant having a baseball bat to protect yourself. Because that\u2019s what you do when you feel that you\u2019re on your own.\u201d Poohl is sitting in the first floor office of Expo in a nondescript block in a residential neighbourhood in Stockholm. Framed covers of the compact, stylish magazine, which today has 7,000 subscribers, adorn the wall behind him. In the next room, the 14 staff members are busy planning the coming issue, page drafts of which are plastered on the wall. It\u2019s hard not to think of Larsson\u2019s fictional investigative publication Millennium, with which there are plenty of parallels in the novels. \u201cA lot of people have said to me that Millennium is basically Expo,\u201d says Poohl. \u201cBut it\u2019s not. Millennium was the ultimate dream magazine. Stieg was a bad businessman, so it would never work in real life.\u201d The success of the novels, which Larsson wrote in his spare time, has partly helped the foundation, however. A representative of Larsson\u2019s estate said that the holding company that controls it has donated a total of over 40 million Swedish kronor (\u00a32.9 million) over the years, which \u201chave clearly been crucial for Expo\u2019s activities.\u201d . Poohl from Expo confirmed that the foundation received one off payments, as well as an additional yearly support from the Larssons for a period and a cut of the fourth novel in the series, The Girl in the Spider\u2019s Web, published in 2015 and authored by David Lagercrantz. \u201cPeople sometimes think we received a lot of money through the books, but it\u2019s less than they think,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re thankful for the financial support that we have received during the years. But the royalty agreement has since ended.\u201d Poohl adds: \u201cThe sad part is that Stieg didn\u2019t get to use his fame to further his political work.\u201d Joakim Larsson, his brother, declined an interview request due to health reasons.

      "body": "<p>America\u2019s moment of reckoning has arrived. On Tuesday, the nation will hold a presidential election like none before, poised between the historic candidacy of a Black woman and a former president branded a fascist by his own former officials.</p> \n<p>The Democrat Kamala Harris and the Republican Donald Trump spent the weekend barnstorming swing states, aware that opinion polls show them <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/election-2024-4-days-out/\">running neck and neck</a> in the race for the White House. Analysts are predicting the closest election since 2000, when George W Bush prevailed by 537 votes, and warning of the threat of civil unrest and political violence.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis time, I venture to say, is a real Armageddon election,\u201d John Zogby, an author and pollster, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/1024885022\">told reporters at</a> the Foreign Press Centers in Washington. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not entirely sure that elements of either side of the electorate are willing to accept the results if their candidate does not win.\u201d</p> \n<p>The contest is also being watched intently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/26/trump-presidency-foreign-policy-gaza-israel-ukraine\">around the world</a>, with victory for Harris likely to represent a continuation of US foreign policy norms but a win for Trump threatening to upend them. The outcome could have profound implications for the wars in Gaza and Ukraine as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/28/donald-trump-climate-change-environment\">the climate crisis</a>.</p> \n<p>Harris has been joined by independents and former Republicans in warning that US democracy itself is on the line. They have sought to remind the electorate that it was only four years ago that Trump instigated a coup against his own government, on 6 January 2021, in a desperate bid to cling to power.</p> \n<p>Mark Milley, a former chair of the joint chiefs of staff, has described Trump as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/10/12/mark-milley-donald-trump-fascist/\">a fascist to the core</a>\u201d. John Kelly, who was Trump\u2019s chief of staff at the White House, has told how the president spoke admiringly of Adolf Hitler\u2019s generals.</p> \n<p>Trump has, if anything, reinforced the point in recent weeks by making ominous comments about \u201cthe enemy from within\u201d, threatening to deploy the military domestically and staging a bigotry-filled rally in New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/28/trump-rally-madison-square-garden/\">echoed a Nazi one held there</a> in 1939.</p> \n<p>Yet still tens of millions of voters are set to back him, accepting his argument that they were better off four years ago than now. Trump has declared: \u201cOn issue after issue, Kamala broke it, but I will fix it.\u201d Harris, for her part, has countered: \u201cIt\u2019s either Donald Trump in there stewing over his enemy\u2019s list, or me, working for you, checking off my to-do list.\u201d</p> \n<p>The election is the most expensive ever, with Democratic campaigns and outside groups having spent about $4.5bn on ads as of last week, compared with about $3.5bn for Republicans. It is focused on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/26/swing-state-polls-pennsylvania-michigan-georgia-arizona-wisconsin-nevada-north-carolina\">seven swing states</a> that will decide the all-important electoral college: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p> \n<p>The contest also represents a vast experiment in the world\u2019s powerful democracy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/aug/18/kamala-harris-presidential-candidate\">Harris, 60</a>, would become the first woman, first Black woman and first person of south Asian descent to serve as president in the nation\u2019s 248-year history if she wins.</p> \n<p>She is up against a 78-year-old white man who has been accused of sexual assault by more than two dozen women, and whose campaign has embraced old-fashioned machismo and \u201cbro culture\u201d in search of votes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"30c47e86-d026-49f3-a3f9-44683ac6bb06\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MH2yL5cLvyo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.tarasetmayer.com/\">Tara Setmayer</a>, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, said: \u201cThe approach of leaning into a toxic masculinity-themed campaign at a time when women\u2019s rights are literally under assault in America is indicative of the absolute regressive and draconian worldview that Donald Trump brings to politics. They have doubled and tripled down on it, appealing to the worst instincts and lowest common denominator in the country.\u201d</p> \n<p>Last week, Trump said he would be a protector of women \u201cwhether the women like it or not\u201d, prompting fierce backlash. Such flashpoints have exposed a historic gender gap in the electorate. In the latest <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/21/harris-trump-tied-battle-latino-black-voters/75682566007/\">USA Today/Suffolk University national poll</a>, women backed Harris 53% to 36%, while men supported Trump 53% to 37%.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/people/elaine-kamarck/\">Elaine Kamarck</a>, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, said: \u201cThe population that is really pissed off is women. I mean really, really, really. The anger that women feel towards this guy is immense and it\u2019ll show up in this election.\u201d</p> \n<p>She added:<em> </em>\u201cThe story of this election is the massive gender gap and it\u2019s for three reasons. One is that there\u2019s a woman candidate. Two is that the abortion issue has brought this right to the fore; previously, there wasn\u2019t an issue for women to rally around.</p> \n<p>\u201cThree is Trump\u2019s own unremitting misogyny, talking about women like: \u2018Oh, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll protect you.\u2019 Go fuck you, mister. We want to live in a place where women don\u2019t need protection as opposed to protection from Donald Trump. Come on. Everything he has done infuriates women.\u201d</p> \n<p>Harris has chosen not to emphasise her gender or race, unlike Hillary Clinton\u2019s stated ambition to break the glass ceiling in 2016. But she has made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2024/oct/26/we-see-you-kamala-harris-focuses-on-reproductive-rights-in-texas-rally-video\">reproductive rights</a> and personal freedoms a rallying cry and backs a national law codifying access to safe abortion.</p> \n<p>Harris was forced to stitch together a campaign in just three months after Joe Biden, 81, chose not to seek re-election. The vice-president has walked a fine line between claiming credit for her part in Biden\u2019s legislative successes while distancing herself from his low approval rating.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/paulbegala?lang=en\">Paul Begala</a>, a political consultant and former adviser to President Bill Clinton, says he is \u201castonished\u201d by Harris\u2019s performance and thinks she has barely put a foot wrong. Democratic strategists were divided, he continued, over whether she should close by stressing Trump\u2019s threat to democracy or a message of economic populism.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe has squared that circle by saying: \u2018He comes to office with an enemies list; I come with a to do list,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so elegant. It\u2019s not just a slogan, it\u2019s a framework. It\u2019s a tree that you can hang a lot of ornaments on. It\u2019s genius and I say that with deep admiration. I think of myself as being pretty good at this. I could not come up with that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Harris, a former senator, California attorney general and San Francisco prosecutor, has unveiled economic plans that include tax cuts for most Americans, bans on price gouging, more affordable housing and a new child tax credit as well as efforts to boost domestic manufacturing. She is seeking to revive a coalition of young voters, people of colour and suburban women.</p> \n<p>But critics argue that, after a flying start, she has lost her way and failed to sell a compelling message. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/27/frank-luntz-interview-pollster-us-uk-politics\">Frank Luntz</a>, a political consultant and pollster, said of her first 45 days on the campaign trail: \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like it. It was a genuine freight train. The best in modern American history, even better than Obama. She took the country by storm.\u201d</p> \n<p>More recently, her campaign has been \u201cabysmal\u201d, Luntz said, adding: \u201cYou have to give voters a second act. You have to give them a second reason to listen and, in her case, she\u2019s not telling them what they want to know or need to know.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump has attacked Harris relentlessly on inflation and immigration, using dehumanising language to call undocumented immigrants \u201canimals\u201d who are \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\u201d and pushing bogus stories about Haitians eating pet cats and dogs in Springfield, Ohio. He has promised the biggest mass deportation operation in history.</p> \n<p>Luntz believes that Harris has failed to find a convincing defence to the claim that she and Biden were too slow to shore up the border. \u201cShe has not figured out how to deal with it because she will not differentiate herself from Joe Biden and that\u2019s a fundamental mistake in her campaign and she may pay the ultimate price for it,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>But Harris\u2019s defenders contend that, as a woman of colour, she is being held to a different standard by a nation grown numb and indifferent to Trump\u2019s excesses. The CNN senior political commentator <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/van-jones-kamala-harris-donald-trump-comments_n_671a14b1e4b07a6807469694\">Van Jones</a> observed: \u201cHe gets to be lawless. She has to be flawless.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fuelled by grievance and a desire for retribution, Trump is making his third consecutive run for the White House after losing his 2020 re-election bid (he continues to falsely claim that it was stolen). He would be the oldest person ever elected to the White House.</p> \n<p>Trump would also be the first convicted criminal to win the presidency. In May, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/30/trump-trial-hush-money-verdict\">he was found guilty</a> of 34 counts of falsifying business records relating to a hush-money payment to the adult film performer Stormy Daniels. He has cast the four criminal cases against him as politically motivated and vowed to investigate or prosecute rivals and election workers if he wins.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s campaign has been characteristically unorthodox. His daughter-in-law Lara Trump is leading Republican efforts to get out the vote in what is her first campaign. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk\">The billionaire Elon Musk</a> and the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk are also playing an outsized role despite having no prior experience. Tens of millions of dollars have been diverted from that ground game to paying Trump\u2019s legal fees.</p> \n<p>Begala, the Democratic strategist, said the Trump campaign has been professionally run and produced some effective ads, but the candidate keeps trampling on their message with insults against women and bizarre riffs. <em>\u201c</em>I guess if I was running that campaign, I would pay Trump hush money. Just shut him up, cut off his mic like they did at the debates. It is just astonishing,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The former president survived two assassination attempts, one at a Pennsylvania campaign rally in July and another in September near one of his Florida golf courses.

      "bodyText": "America\u2019s moment of reckoning has arrived. On Tuesday, the nation will hold a presidential election like none before, poised between the historic candidacy of a Black woman and a former president branded a fascist by his own former officials. The Democrat Kamala Harris and the Republican Donald Trump spent the weekend barnstorming swing states, aware that opinion polls show them running neck and neck in the race for the White House. Analysts are predicting the closest election since 2000, when George W Bush prevailed by 537 votes, and warning of the threat of civil unrest and political violence. \u201cThis time, I venture to say, is a real Armageddon election,\u201d John Zogby, an author and pollster, told reporters at the Foreign Press Centers in Washington. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not entirely sure that elements of either side of the electorate are willing to accept the results if their candidate does not win.\u201d The contest is also being watched intently around the world, with victory for Harris likely to represent a continuation of US foreign policy norms but a win for Trump threatening to upend them. The outcome could have profound implications for the wars in Gaza and Ukraine as well as the climate crisis. Harris has been joined by independents and former Republicans in warning that US democracy itself is on the line. They have sought to remind the electorate that it was only four years ago that Trump instigated a coup against his own government, on 6 January 2021, in a desperate bid to cling to power. Mark Milley, a former chair of the joint chiefs of staff, has described Trump as \u201ca fascist to the core\u201d. John Kelly, who was Trump\u2019s chief of staff at the White House, has told how the president spoke admiringly of Adolf Hitler\u2019s generals. Trump has, if anything, reinforced the point in recent weeks by making ominous comments about \u201cthe enemy from within\u201d, threatening to deploy the military domestically and staging a bigotry-filled rally in New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden that echoed a Nazi one held there in 1939. Yet still tens of millions of voters are set to back him, accepting his argument that they were better off four years ago than now. Trump has declared: \u201cOn issue after issue, Kamala broke it, but I will fix it.\u201d Harris, for her part, has countered: \u201cIt\u2019s either Donald Trump in there stewing over his enemy\u2019s list, or me, working for you, checking off my to-do list.\u201d The election is the most expensive ever, with Democratic campaigns and outside groups having spent about $4.5bn on ads as of last week, compared with about $3.5bn for Republicans. It is focused on seven swing states that will decide the all-important electoral college: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The contest also represents a vast experiment in the world\u2019s powerful democracy. Harris, 60, would become the first woman, first Black woman and first person of south Asian descent to serve as president in the nation\u2019s 248-year history if she wins. She is up against a 78-year-old white man who has been accused of sexual assault by more than two dozen women, and whose campaign has embraced old-fashioned machismo and \u201cbro culture\u201d in search of votes. Tara Setmayer, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, said: \u201cThe approach of leaning into a toxic masculinity-themed campaign at a time when women\u2019s rights are literally under assault in America is indicative of the absolute regressive and draconian worldview that Donald Trump brings to politics. They have doubled and tripled down on it, appealing to the worst instincts and lowest common denominator in the country.\u201d Last week, Trump said he would be a protector of women \u201cwhether the women like it or not\u201d, prompting fierce backlash. Such flashpoints have exposed a historic gender gap in the electorate. In the latest USA Today/Suffolk University national poll, women backed Harris 53% to 36%, while men supported Trump 53% to 37%. Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, said: \u201cThe population that is really pissed off is women. I mean really, really, really. The anger that women feel towards this guy is immense and it\u2019ll show up in this election.\u201d She added: \u201cThe story of this election is the massive gender gap and it\u2019s for three reasons. One is that there\u2019s a woman candidate. Two is that the abortion issue has brought this right to the fore; previously, there wasn\u2019t an issue for women to rally around. \u201cThree is Trump\u2019s own unremitting misogyny, talking about women like: \u2018Oh, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll protect you.\u2019 Go fuck you, mister. We want to live in a place where women don\u2019t need protection as opposed to protection from Donald Trump. Come on. Everything he has done infuriates women.\u201d Harris has chosen not to emphasise her gender or race, unlike Hillary Clinton\u2019s stated ambition to break the glass ceiling in 2016. But she has made reproductive rights and personal freedoms a rallying cry and backs a national law codifying access to safe abortion. Harris was forced to stitch together a campaign in just three months after Joe Biden, 81, chose not to seek re-election. The vice-president has walked a fine line between claiming credit for her part in Biden\u2019s legislative successes while distancing herself from his low approval rating. Paul Begala, a political consultant and former adviser to President Bill Clinton, says he is \u201castonished\u201d by Harris\u2019s performance and thinks she has barely put a foot wrong. Democratic strategists were divided, he continued, over whether she should close by stressing Trump\u2019s threat to democracy or a message of economic populism. \u201cShe has squared that circle by saying: \u2018He comes to office with an enemies list; I come with a to do list,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so elegant. It\u2019s not just a slogan, it\u2019s a framework. It\u2019s a tree that you can hang a lot of ornaments on. It\u2019s genius and I say that with deep admiration. I think of myself as being pretty good at this. I could not come up with that.\u201d Harris, a former senator, California attorney general and San Francisco prosecutor, has unveiled economic plans that include tax cuts for most Americans, bans on price gouging, more affordable housing and a new child tax credit as well as efforts to boost domestic manufacturing. She is seeking to revive a coalition of young voters, people of colour and suburban women. But critics argue that, after a flying start, she has lost her way and failed to sell a compelling message. Frank Luntz, a political consultant and pollster, said of her first 45 days on the campaign trail: \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like it. It was a genuine freight train. The best in modern American history, even better than Obama. She took the country by storm.\u201d More recently, her campaign has been \u201cabysmal\u201d, Luntz said, adding: \u201cYou have to give voters a second act. You have to give them a second reason to listen and, in her case, she\u2019s not telling them what they want to know or need to know.\u201d Trump has attacked Harris relentlessly on inflation and immigration, using dehumanising language to call undocumented immigrants \u201canimals\u201d who are \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\u201d and pushing bogus stories about Haitians eating pet cats and dogs in Springfield, Ohio. He has promised the biggest mass deportation operation in history. Luntz believes that Harris has failed to find a convincing defence to the claim that she and Biden were too slow to shore up the border. \u201cShe has not figured out how to deal with it because she will not differentiate herself from Joe Biden and that\u2019s a fundamental mistake in her campaign and she may pay the ultimate price for it,\u201d he said. But Harris\u2019s defenders contend that, as a woman of colour, she is being held to a different standard by a nation grown numb and indifferent to Trump\u2019s excesses. The CNN senior political commentator Van Jones observed: \u201cHe gets to be lawless. She has to be flawless.\u201d Fuelled by grievance and a desire for retribution, Trump is making his third consecutive run for the White House after losing his 2020 re-election bid (he continues to falsely claim that it was stolen). He would be the oldest person ever elected to the White House. Trump would also be the first convicted criminal to win the presidency. In May, he was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records relating to a hush-money payment to the adult film performer Stormy Daniels. He has cast the four criminal cases against him as politically motivated and vowed to investigate or prosecute rivals and election workers if he wins. Trump\u2019s campaign has been characteristically unorthodox. His daughter-in-law Lara Trump is leading Republican efforts to get out the vote in what is her first campaign. The billionaire Elon Musk and the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk are also playing an outsized role despite having no prior experience. Tens of millions of dollars have been diverted from that ground game to paying Trump\u2019s legal fees. Begala, the Democratic strategist, said the Trump campaign has been professionally run and produced some effective ads, but the candidate keeps trampling on their message with insults against women and bizarre riffs. \u201cI guess if I was running that campaign, I would pay Trump hush money. Just shut him up, cut off his mic like they did at the debates. It is just astonishing,\u201d he said. The former president survived two assassination attempts, one at a Pennsylvania campaign rally in July and another in September near one of his Florida golf courses. He emerged from the first incident with a bloodstained face, fist raised, and a call for his supporters to \u201cFight, fight, fight!\u201d \u2013 a chant now adopted at his rallies. Trump, who chose Senator JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate, has vowed to fundamentally change Washington\u2019s relationship with Nato and resolve the Ukraine war with possible peace talks that might require Kyiv to cede territory. He has said Hamas must be \u201ccrushed\u201d and vowed to be tougher on Iran. Leon Panetta, a former defence secretary and CIA director, said: \u201cIt is in many ways a choice between whether or not we will provide world leadership or whether we will hide in isolationism and basically withdraw from the rest of the world into an \u2018America first\u2019 approach. That will have serious consequences in terms of America\u2019s place in the world or certainly will have an impact in terms of our relationship with the international community.\u201d Just as in 2020, the election will be a stress test for democracy in a bitterly polarised nation. Trump has refused to commit to accepting the 2024 results or to rule out possible political violence, while he and Republicans lay the groundwork to contest a potential loss. He tells his rallies to expect a big victory on Tuesday, saying he could only envision losing \u201cif it was a corrupt election\u201d. Some of his supporters are adamant that they would not accept defeat.

      "body": "<p>A modern Christmas without a LadBaby charity single, some might say, is like sausage meat without the pastry, but it\u2019s something we now have to adjust to. Between 2018 and 2022, Mark and Roxanne Hoyle, the husband-and-wife team behind the social media brand LadBaby, had the Christmas No 1 \u2013 for such things still matter \u2013 sewn up. With their fifth, they broke the record set by the Beatles. One year, they collaborated with Elton John and Ed Sheeran. Then last year, they decided they\u2019d had enough. What had started as a joke, and a way to raise money for the food bank charity the Trussell Trust (now known as Trussell), had become more successful than they\u2019d ever thought possible.</p> <p>It also came with a backlash, after allegations spread online that the Hoyles were pocketing the money. They received a deluge of online abuse, threats in public and blackmail attempts. They were labelled grifters and, worse, Tories (in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/20/ladbaby-i-love-sausage-rolls-christmas-no-1-charity-food-banks\">2019 Guardian interview</a>, they had declined to say how they voted). Mark started experiencing panic attacks, something he still lives with. Now they\u2019ve written a memoir, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/our-ladbaby-journey-9781408734186/\">Our LadBaby Journey</a>, detailing much of this, and it seems a bit of a cautionary tale \u2013 what happens when two ordinary people become online celebrities, and some silly Christmas songs about sausage rolls end with threats and the police involved.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>When there was this narrative going around that we stole the money and profited from it, it was really difficult to take</p> <footer> <cite>Mark Hoyle</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Writing the book, says Roxanne, was \u201clike therapy, getting it out on paper\u201d. It also made them realise what they had achieved, she says. They have built a brand with 13 million followers across several social media platforms, by posting funny videos of themselves. They have paying subscribers who join them live three times a week. They\u2019ve written children\u2019s and parenting books, created a game and do a podcast (we\u2019re talking via video call, the couple in the attic room in their Nottingham house where they record it). As content creators, says Roxanne, it\u2019s always about \u201cwhat\u2019s next, what\u2019s next \u2013 and social media is so fast, I don\u2019t think we ever really celebrated or took in how big it was\u201d.</p>    <p>Mark, 37, started LadBaby in 2016 as a Facebook page. At the time, Roxanne, 40, was pregnant and Mark was working as a graphic designer in advertising. The first of his friends to become a father, he felt he wasn\u2019t getting what he needed from the online parenting influencers. \u201cI was like, I want to read the bloke that owns a chippy and has three kids, the everyday bloke that\u2019s talking about being a dad. So I set up this blog, and I hoped to meet people like me.\u201d The height of his ambition, he says, was to get noticed by a baby brand and get some free nappies out of it.</p> <p>They were struggling financially. Roxanne had worked as an art director in advertising, but had given up work to look after their son because childcare costs were too high. But she had been the higher earner, and now they were trying to survive on Mark\u2019s single salary. After all the bills had been paid, they budgeted \u00a320 a week for food. \u201cI\u2019d go round Aldi with a calculator,\u201d she says. Once, she accidentally went 70p over and couldn\u2019t pay for her shopping; a man in the queue gave her a pound. Mark says it was very difficult to deal with at the time. He turns to his wife. \u201cI don\u2019t think I truly shared with you how it made me feel, because I didn\u2019t want it to look like I wasn\u2019t coping. But I was terrified. I was the only one bringing the money, and it wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d Laughter, he says, was vital. \u201cYou\u2019d try to make a joke \u2013 it\u2019s what my family did when I was little, and it\u2019s always got us through everything.\u201d</p>    <p>The early LadBaby was just Mark posting photos with captions, and although he got approximately 1,000 followers, it felt as though it was going nowhere. Just when he was considering giving up, he made a video, having never had the confidence before \u2013 a lasting effect, he thinks, of the severe bullying he experienced as a child. \u201cI was, like, \u2018I hate the sound of my own voice, I hate how my teeth look, it\u2019s never something I\u2019ll do.\u2019 I think that\u2019s what LadBaby did for me personally: it helped with my confidence.\u201d The video he made using a free editing app (the same one he still uses), in which Mark got a \u00a34 toolbox to use as his son\u2019s lunchbox, went viral. So did others. Still, it was two years before he finally gave up his graphic design job to concentrate on LadBaby full-time. By then, thanks to the way content creators could monetise their videos, it looked as if they could earn more in a month than he had in a year.</p> <p>The number of followers kept growing. Nothing prepares you, says Roxanne, for becoming internet famous. \u201cThere\u2019s no manual or education on how to deal with that,\u201d she says. Mark adds: \u201cNo one tells you what to do or how to do it, or how to navigate getting recognised on the street. That was something we\u2019ve had to learn on the job. We were a bit naive in the beginning, especially with privacy and how much we put online.\u201d At their house in Hemel Hempstead, he would film their street and front door. \u201cI think we never expected as many people to be watching,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The Hoyles say they want privacy for their children, but their two sons still appear in their content. Do they ever regret having started that? \u201cWe\u2019re always reviewing it,\u201d says Mark. \u201cWe let them judge whether or not they want to be involved \u2013 we don\u2019t force them. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll see our oldest more than our youngest online.\u201d Roxanne says she doesn\u2019t regret it, \u201cbecause my sons have experienced things they would never have experienced if me and Mark hadn\u2019t started LadBaby. My kids have wonderful things because of what we created and they have these lovely video memories of us as a family. But they are made aware of how many people there are in the world who watch Mummy and Daddy.\u201d Has it not given their children a warped view of how to act when they see a phone in the vicinity? \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d says Mark. Their younger son, especially, hates having his photo taken. \u201cSo he definitely doesn\u2019t feel the expectation to turn it on for cameras.\u201d</p> <p>At their previous house, someone had put their address on Google maps, and people started turning up. \u201cIt was frightening,\u201d says Mark. Online popularity is different from the kind of fame the general public recognise and when they reported it, the police didn\u2019t seem to take it seriously. Their only advice was to stop posting videos. The couple ended up moving to Nottingham, where Mark grew up.</p> <p>Online fame is even harder for younger people to deal with, he says. For many, the dream is to become an influencer and make a lot of money from content, but it comes with pressure to create more and more, and abuse is inevitable. \u201cWe were lucky that we had internet success when we were married with a mortgage and a kid, because a lot of people that get into social media, they\u2019re like 17, 18, and they haven\u2019t worked lots of jobs or seen the real world or had responsibility.\u201d Both have met people who define themselves by their follower count. \u201cThey\u2019ll go, \u2018I\u2019m 8 million,\u2019\u201d says Mark.</p>    <p>Early on, both would get horrible comments about the way they looked. \u201cIt\u2019s hard sometimes,\u201d says Roxanne, who has had endless commentary on her weight. \u201cIt does affect me, but I\u2019ve become more resilient. I remember someone saying, \u2018Your team must have to deal with trolling and read all the comments.\u2019 What they didn\u2019t realise is, we don\u2019t have these teams that some people have.\u201d To succeed as a social media star, Mark points out in the book, you have to want to be liked. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why it\u2019s a like button, right? Inevitably, when you put something out there, you are wanting people to like it. I know people put things out to cause controversy, but we don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>They had been largely celebrated when their first Christmas single had been released in 2018, a cover of Starship\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iEB8bfP7wE\">We Built This City</a>, rewritten about sausage rolls to raise money for Trussell (Roxanne\u2019s mother was a food bank volunteer). But by the time their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsRJ-iRZasQ\">fourth single</a>, this time with Elton John and Ed Sheeran, was announced, the abuse had ramped up. A story spread that the Hoyles were taking some of the charity money. Even though Trussell stepped in and said it wasn\u2019t true, the allegations stuck.</p>    <p>Another criticism was that they had used the charity single as a way to promote and build their own brand. It happened concurrently, says Mark, \u201cand I think there were a lot of misconceptions around money. I really struggled with that, because it\u2019s one thing people going, \u2018We don\u2019t like your teeth, we don\u2019t like your voice.\u2019 But when there\u2019s this narrative going around that we stole the money and we profited from it, it was really difficult to take.\u201d</p> <p>They had also remained staunchly apolitical. \u201cOur channels are just about doing silly videos and making people laugh,\u201d says Mark. \u201cIt\u2019s never about taking a side in politics, in religion. It\u2019s not really our place. We just want it to be a fun, positive place.\u201d But for the record, he says, they both vote Labour. \u201cI\u2019ve always voted Labour. I come from a working-class background, I voted Labour at every election.\u201d</p> <p>In the years that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/09/britons-vulnerable-reliance-food-banks-research-finds\">food bank use</a> has exploded, poverty in the UK has been largely blamed on the Conservative government\u2019s brutal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/10/how-austerity-and-ideology-broke-britain\">austerity policies</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/09/britons-vulnerable-reliance-food-banks-research-finds#:~:text=Trussell%20%E2%80%93%20formerly%20known%20as%20the,%E2%80%9Cjust%20and%20compassionate%20society%E2%80%9D.\">Trussell</a> has been seeing its highest levels of need, and provided 3.1m food parcels in the past year, a rise of 94% over five years.

That\u2019s how we can make a difference. We can raise awareness and try to raise money.\u201d Roxanne points out that the abuse had become intolerable. \u201cI don\u2019t think people realise the impact of that level of trolling, where the police came to support us through that time.\u201d There is no way she would have had the confidence, she says, to start sharing her opinions about the government.</p> <p>It probably would have been better to have denied the financial allegations more strenuously, says Mark. \u201cBut we were scared,\u201d adds Roxanne. People were sending threats, saying they knew where they lived. Mark was threatened in a pub, and had to be bundled into a taxi by the bouncers. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know how to [handle] it,\u201d says Mark. \u201cAnd quite often, you don\u2019t want to make the situation worse, and so you don\u2019t do anything.\u201d Mark started experiencing panic attacks. Eventually, the police did start to take the threats seriously, and at one point the Hoyles had anti-terror officers at home advising them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re not credible music artists, but it was sad because a lot of people could have helped the charity</p> <footer> <cite>Roxanne Hoyle</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2022, the couple were sent a video by someone who claimed it showed Mark groping a woman in a Nottingham bar, and demanded \u00a310,000 to prevent it being released.

In the book, Mark admits he was nervous about how their new, bigger house would go down with their audience. Roxanne insists they haven\u2019t changed. Their audience, she says, has \u201cgrown with us and seen us evolve into these two people, and I like to think we\u2019ve remained true to who we are\u201d.</p> <p>But it remains a tricky balance. I wonder how much class plays into it \u2013 there are, after all, plenty of middle-class influencers who monetise their audience and sell products, but who don\u2019t, I suspect, attract the same vitriol. Is there more criticism of working-class influencers?</p> <p>\u201cNot necessarily creators as such,\u201d says Mark, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s harder for working-class people to break into a lot of industries. I struggled at university [both were the first of their families to go]. I struggled in advertising.\u201d They have experienced snobbery from the publishing and music industries. \u201cWe get it,\u201d says Roxanne. \u201cWe\u2019re not credible music artists, but it was sad because a lot of people could have helped the charity.\u201d Even now, at events they might go to, \u201cthere are still people that won\u2019t want you there, that don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve worked for it, that don\u2019t believe you are [proper] authors, or that you are naturally good at making videos\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A modern Christmas without a LadBaby charity single, some might say, is like sausage meat without the pastry, but it\u2019s something we now have to adjust to. Between 2018 and 2022, Mark and Roxanne Hoyle, the husband-and-wife team behind the social media brand LadBaby, had the Christmas No 1 \u2013 for such things still matter \u2013 sewn up. With their fifth, they broke the record set by the Beatles. One year, they collaborated with Elton John and Ed Sheeran. Then last year, they decided they\u2019d had enough. What had started as a joke, and a way to raise money for the food bank charity the Trussell Trust (now known as Trussell), had become more successful than they\u2019d ever thought possible. It also came with a backlash, after allegations spread online that the Hoyles were pocketing the money. They received a deluge of online abuse, threats in public and blackmail attempts. They were labelled grifters and, worse, Tories (in a 2019 Guardian interview, they had declined to say how they voted). Mark started experiencing panic attacks, something he still lives with. Now they\u2019ve written a memoir, Our LadBaby Journey, detailing much of this, and it seems a bit of a cautionary tale \u2013 what happens when two ordinary people become online celebrities, and some silly Christmas songs about sausage rolls end with threats and the police involved. Writing the book, says Roxanne, was \u201clike therapy, getting it out on paper\u201d. It also made them realise what they had achieved, she says. They have built a brand with 13 million followers across several social media platforms, by posting funny videos of themselves. They have paying subscribers who join them live three times a week. They\u2019ve written children\u2019s and parenting books, created a game and do a podcast (we\u2019re talking via video call, the couple in the attic room in their Nottingham house where they record it). As content creators, says Roxanne, it\u2019s always about \u201cwhat\u2019s next, what\u2019s next \u2013 and social media is so fast, I don\u2019t think we ever really celebrated or took in how big it was\u201d. Mark, 37, started LadBaby in 2016 as a Facebook page. At the time, Roxanne, 40, was pregnant and Mark was working as a graphic designer in advertising. The first of his friends to become a father, he felt he wasn\u2019t getting what he needed from the online parenting influencers. \u201cI was like, I want to read the bloke that owns a chippy and has three kids, the everyday bloke that\u2019s talking about being a dad. So I set up this blog, and I hoped to meet people like me.\u201d The height of his ambition, he says, was to get noticed by a baby brand and get some free nappies out of it. They were struggling financially. Roxanne had worked as an art director in advertising, but had given up work to look after their son because childcare costs were too high. But she had been the higher earner, and now they were trying to survive on Mark\u2019s single salary. After all the bills had been paid, they budgeted \u00a320 a week for food. \u201cI\u2019d go round Aldi with a calculator,\u201d she says. Once, she accidentally went 70p over and couldn\u2019t pay for her shopping; a man in the queue gave her a pound. Mark says it was very difficult to deal with at the time. He turns to his wife. \u201cI don\u2019t think I truly shared with you how it made me feel, because I didn\u2019t want it to look like I wasn\u2019t coping. But I was terrified. I was the only one bringing the money, and it wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d Laughter, he says, was vital. \u201cYou\u2019d try to make a joke \u2013 it\u2019s what my family did when I was little, and it\u2019s always got us through everything.\u201d The early LadBaby was just Mark posting photos with captions, and although he got approximately 1,000 followers, it felt as though it was going nowhere. Just when he was considering giving up, he made a video, having never had the confidence before \u2013 a lasting effect, he thinks, of the severe bullying he experienced as a child. \u201cI was, like, \u2018I hate the sound of my own voice, I hate how my teeth look, it\u2019s never something I\u2019ll do.\u2019 I think that\u2019s what LadBaby did for me personally: it helped with my confidence.\u201d The video he made using a free editing app (the same one he still uses), in which Mark got a \u00a34 toolbox to use as his son\u2019s lunchbox, went viral. So did others. Still, it was two years before he finally gave up his graphic design job to concentrate on LadBaby full-time. By then, thanks to the way content creators could monetise their videos, it looked as if they could earn more in a month than he had in a year. The number of followers kept growing. Nothing prepares you, says Roxanne, for becoming internet famous. \u201cThere\u2019s no manual or education on how to deal with that,\u201d she says. Mark adds: \u201cNo one tells you what to do or how to do it, or how to navigate getting recognised on the street. That was something we\u2019ve had to learn on the job. We were a bit naive in the beginning, especially with privacy and how much we put online.\u201d At their house in Hemel Hempstead, he would film their street and front door. \u201cI think we never expected as many people to be watching,\u201d he says. The Hoyles say they want privacy for their children, but their two sons still appear in their content. Do they ever regret having started that? \u201cWe\u2019re always reviewing it,\u201d says Mark. \u201cWe let them judge whether or not they want to be involved \u2013 we don\u2019t force them. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll see our oldest more than our youngest online.\u201d Roxanne says she doesn\u2019t regret it, \u201cbecause my sons have experienced things they would never have experienced if me and Mark hadn\u2019t started LadBaby. My kids have wonderful things because of what we created and they have these lovely video memories of us as a family. But they are made aware of how many people there are in the world who watch Mummy and Daddy.\u201d Has it not given their children a warped view of how to act when they see a phone in the vicinity? \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d says Mark.

The love poems that make up this series, My Husband Sings, frequently take the shape of a sonnet; written with warmth, tenderness and unobtrusive skill, they often explore moments of vulnerability. My Husband Falling names the major culprit, Time. Not a sonnet, it lets the narrative find an appropriate three-part form of its own.</p> <p>In the opening assertion \u2013 \u201cTime trips you like a pavement\u201d \u2013 the context (the pavement on which the fall occurs) is suggested by the simile which foregrounds the impersonal destructive force and its \u201cstony lesson\u201d. Time, pavement-like, doesn\u2019t seem to care at this point about the person it hits. Later, in the second stanza, time becomes a more genial figure: although \u201criding to / trip you once more\u201d the subsequent rhyme introduces a mollifying note of concern: \u201cchiding you / to steady yourself, slow down.\u201d At this point in the narrative, the \u201cyounger husband\u201d, presumably the poem\u2019s speaker, has succeeded in helping his partner to his feet, and restoring the physical and emotional balance. There are lines where the enjambment is delicately effective in suggesting tentativeness, a certain wobble: \u201cyour / feet\u201d, \u201cupright / again\u201d.</p> <p>For the speaker, the perspective has changed: the hardness of the \u201cslabs\u201d, a word freighted with mortality, has been set at a distance. The female passers-by have expressed \u201csolicitude\u201d, a man has made light-hearted comments: this is the \u201cstraight\u201d social context but it is benign. The speaker\u2019s husband is \u201cupright\u201d and safe physically. The words of \u201cchiding\u201d that warn him \u201cto steady yourself, slow down\u201d seem likely to echo the speaker\u2019s own.</p> <p>The rhetorical questions and their answers in the third stanza aid the psychological restabilising needed and are preparation for the concept of \u201cfragility\u201d with which the poem concludes. The speaker\u2019s hands, it seems, have failed in their purpose, if that was to save the husband from falling, but, it\u2019s implied, they will be quicker and readier in future. The \u201ccuts\u201d which were so painfully registered in lines three to five are given different significance by the answer to the question as to what they\u2019re for: they exist \u201cto show why blood travels / under your skin\u201d. Blood here seems to represent energy, erotic pleasure and healing. The poem has, in effect, over-balanced the threat of time and ageing that dominated the first stanza, and now gives the protection of proven \u201cfragility\u201d a special emphasis. Both husbands are included in the pronoun \u201cour\u201d in \u201cour fragility\u201d: the damage of the \u201cstony lesson\u201d which has been averted is a potentially shared one, part of the physical ageing that is integral to a long-term relationship. The \u201cgold\u201d which is placed alongside \u201cbreath\u201d in the poem\u2019s last line points to the ring which each man wears, evoked in another poem in the series, the sonnet New Gold. They compare rings and the sonnet ends: \u201cWe place / our hands together to compare, to show/ how the years etch rings and skin.

It\u2019s a stony lesson \u2014 cuts to lip and wrist and knee, where skin meets slabs. The solicitude of women, a man\u2019s joke about brandy, your younger husband lifting you, using both hands to balance your weight, raise you to your feet, ensure you stand upright again, planted in your shoes as if falling becomes improbable, though time might be riding to trip you once more, chiding you to steady yourself, slow down.

It\u2019s an event that dominates the media for the better part of every fourth year in the calendar (and a not-inconsiderable part of the other three), not without good reason: these races have been enormously consequential, as are many of the down-ballot races squeezed out of as much attention. Yet this urgency is not something often well-captured in movies about US elections, which frequently fall somewhere between flop-sweaty dramatic earnestness or toothless comedic mildness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/19/trump-harris-podcasts-election-strategy\">Call Her Daddy to Theo Von: how podcasts became a vital election tool</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maybe contemporary films can\u2019t compete with the breathlessness of modern campaign coverage \u2013 and they may not want to successfully imitate their numbing repetition. All the King\u2019s Men, which won the Oscar for best picture of 1949, is one of the most prominent dramas to follow a series of elections as an iterative process, chronicling the various campaigns of Willie Stark (Broderick Crawford) on his way to the governor\u2019s mansion of an unnamed southern state. (He\u2019s based on Louisiana\u2019s Huey Long.) Some of the story turns creak 75 years later, but what feels prescient (or at least unchanging) about it is a portrait of a man subsumed by his voracious stump activity, which starts to feel like Stark\u2019s lifeblood, rather than a means to an end. The campaign-first feeling reaches a logical conclusion in 1972\u2019s The Candidate, where his initial status as a lost cause emboldens Bill McKay (Robert Redford) to speak his mind, which increases his popularity, which in turn flattens out his messaging closer to meaningless \u2013 until he actually wins, and no one on his staff can tell him what\u2019s supposed to happen next.</p>    <p>It\u2019s easy to see why modern audiences might not want to watch a movie reminding them that a campaign might represent a protracted build-up to a chilly punchline, or the means to a former hero\u2019s downfall. By the time a remake of All the King\u2019s Men (or re-adaptation of the original novel) came in 2006, it didn\u2019t have many new insights to offer. In fact, a lot of newer election movies feel vaguely like remakes, even when they\u2019re not: George Clooney\u2019s entertaining but largely forgotten The Ides of March, for example, feels like a late-1960s take on a mid-1990s subject (sexual impropriety and cover-ups on the trail). Unfortunately, it came out in 2011. The similarly high-profile Primary Colors had a bestselling novel as source material, and effectively doubled star power from a then-popular John Travolta playing an obvious gloss on then-popular Bill Clinton (albeit under a different name), and yet it was still a box office disappointment that didn\u2019t seem to have much of a shelf life beyond its 1998 release. </p> <p>An even better backstage campaign drama made even less of a splash: Jason Reitman\u2019s The Front Runner in 2018, a condensation of three weeks in 1987 where the prospects of one-time presidential frontrunner Gary Hart imploded before even reaching the 1988 Democratic primaries. Though Reitman has made tart comedies scripted by Diablo Cody, The Front Runner is more incidentally witty than pointedly satirical, earnestly suggesting that a more tabloid-friendly style of press coverage and Hart\u2019s utter lack of preparation to face it down accidentally collaborated to produce a turning point in American politics.</p> <p>That late-80s pivot probably also contributed to the ramped-up number of election-related comedies in the following decade. A resurgent Saturday Night Live became a major focus of seasonal political comedy, so it was only natural for bigger-screen movies to take a crack at the more farcical side of politics. But many of the resulting comedies of that era foul up seemingly foolproof premises. Take Speechless, the 1994 romcom about speechwriters for rival campaigns played by Michael Keaton and Geena Davis. It would be difficult to find two actors of that era better-equipped to play smart, snippy and neo-screwball. Instead, the movie opts for cutesy contrivances. Black Sheep from 1996 made a de facto Tommy Boy sequel by reuniting David Spade, as a campaign worker placed in charge of the candidate\u2019s accident-prone brother, with Chris Farley playing said brother. It\u2019s depressingly dreadful, with none of the earlier movie\u2019s snap or charm. Even Bulworth, a sharper and more satirically minded election movie from later in the decade, has the corniness of watching Warren Beatty doing raps (and anyway, is more about the professional politician turned truth-teller than the mechanics of a specific election).</p> <p>Still, Bulworth points the way toward a third option between embarrassing sincerity and outright slapstick: satire that splits the difference between the two. Even this is no kind of guarantee: look at Jon Stewart\u2019s clumsy, ill-timed Irresistible, a mostly forgotten 2020 release trying to capture a post-2016 moment by both-sides-ing campaign finance with wan jokes. This stuff is harder than it looks: No less a film-maker than Preston Sturges gave election comedy a shot with 1940\u2019s The Great McGinty, and while the movie about a vagrant turned fraudster turned candidate turned actual governor is certainly funny and charming, the movies Sturges made immediately afterward (this was the first directorial effort from the longtime screenwriter) actually feel more in touch with the mix of greed, avarice and eventual good intentions that might make for a classic political satire. By comparison, The Great McGinty ultimately resembles a slightly thornier but second-tier Frank Capra movie.</p>    <p>That trickiness could be why 25 years after its release, the definitive American election movie arguably remains, uh, Election. Rather than the typical move of sending a scrappy, well-intentioned underdog into the unforgiving machinery of politics, Election brings the petty personality clashes and self-delusions down to the level of a high school popularity contest. Tom Perrotta\u2019s original novel intended for the three candidates to roughly parallel figures from the 1992 presidential election, but the movie brings them to life so hilariously and specifically that they echo throughout history. Hillary Clinton was branded a Tracy Flick type \u2013 a hyper-competent striver who feels entitled to collect her victory, brilliantly played by Reese Witherspoon \u2013 years before she actually ran for president. (The film is missing a Trump figure, of course, despite two of the three candidates being woefully unqualified, because the maturity levels of the teenage characters far exceed his.)</p> <p>Election, a jet-black comedy of self-deception, is the definitive movie about American politics, but maybe the most purely evocative way of portraying US elections on film is to let them play out a little closer to the background, where there\u2019s less pressure to create a narrative dependent on heroes and villains (or dependent on everyone being horrible). That\u2019s the elegant trick pulled off by the 1970s-made Nashville and the 1970s-set Licorice Pizza, weaving election hullaballoo into a bustling marathon hangout session, where both the stakes and the pettiness feel like an organic part of the non-traditional story at hand. This does risk a kind of passiveness, suggesting elections are just something that are in the air, rather than records and consequences of the electorate\u2019s will. In other words, the election as a vibe, rather than action. But maybe that also reflects that drawn-out process, something we live with for months, despite the vote itself taking as little as minutes out of our day. As the most prominent election movies understand, these narratives aren\u2019t really about the final decision. They\u2019re about a campaign that sometimes feels like it cannot be allowed to properly end \u2013 half reassurance of continuity, half threat of purgatory.</p>",

Tom Perrotta\u2019s original novel intended for the three candidates to roughly parallel figures from the 1992 presidential election, but the movie brings them to life so hilariously and specifically that they echo throughout history. Hillary Clinton was branded a Tracy Flick type \u2013 a hyper-competent striver who feels entitled to collect her victory, brilliantly played by Reese Witherspoon \u2013 years before she actually ran for president. (The film is missing a Trump figure, of course, despite two of the three candidates being woefully unqualified, because the maturity levels of the teenage characters far exceed his.) Election, a jet-black comedy of self-deception, is the definitive movie about American politics, but maybe the most purely evocative way of portraying US elections on film is to let them play out a little closer to the background, where there\u2019s less pressure to create a narrative dependent on heroes and villains (or dependent on everyone being horrible). That\u2019s the elegant trick pulled off by the 1970s-made Nashville and the 1970s-set Licorice Pizza, weaving election hullaballoo into a bustling marathon hangout session, where both the stakes and the pettiness feel like an organic part of the non-traditional story at hand. This does risk a kind of passiveness, suggesting elections are just something that are in the air, rather than records and consequences of the electorate\u2019s will. In other words, the election as a vibe, rather than action. But maybe that also reflects that drawn-out process, something we live with for months, despite the vote itself taking as little as minutes out of our day. As the most prominent election movies understand, these narratives aren\u2019t really about the final decision. They\u2019re about a campaign that sometimes feels like it cannot be allowed to properly end \u2013 half reassurance of continuity, half threat of purgatory.",

The Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/18/inflation-fed-rate-cut\">cut interest rates</a> last month, the first time since 2020.

Seven US voters weigh their options</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Paul Spehar, 62, a maintenance technician based in Daytona Beach, Florida, has seen reports that the economy is doing well but has only seen his savings chip away. His car insurance tripled over the last three years, and he had to take on $2,000 in debt to pay for the copay of a recent surgery. When Spehar retires, he will have to rely solely on Social Security.</p> <p>\u201cThe system doesn\u2019t work for people like me,\u201d Spehar said.</p> <p>It\u2019s a common sentiment. In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/30/harris-trump-economic-proposals-poll\">Harris Poll</a> conducted exclusively for the Guardian in September, nearly 50% of Americans believed that the country was experiencing a recession. Over 60% believed that inflation was increasing, and 50% believed that unemployment was increasing too. Even those who may know what the economists are saying don\u2019t feel great: 73% said it was hard to feel good about any positive economic news when they felt financially squeezed each month.</p> <p>As election day draws closer, and voters consistently <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/\">say</a> that the economy is their number one issue, the stakes of understanding why voters feel so blue have never been higher. So why do economists and everyday Americans seem to live in two different realities? The answer may come down to how they view inflation.</p> <p>For economists, inflation is a \u201cnominal thing\u201d, said Stefanie Stantcheva, an economist at Harvard. In other words, for economists, inflation is a measure \u2013 an important measure, especially for the Federal Reserve, which is tasked with adjusting monetary to control inflation. But for everyday Americans, inflation is a lived experience.</p> <p>\u201c[Lived experiences] teach us a lot, and they show us that people are suffering a lot from inflation, perhaps more than the baseline numbers say,\u201d Stantcheva said. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to not just look at that number and say, \u2018Oh, but this is what CPI [the consumer price index, a broad measure of inflation] says.\u2019 \u2026 People have a different experience from that, and those experiences should be taken seriously.\u201d</p> <p>That \u201cnominal\u201d number elicits feelings of anger, fear, anxiety and stress \u2013 along with a sense of inequality and injustice, when people are asked open-ended questions about how inflation makes them feel, said Stantcheva.</p> <p>People \u201cthink that wages are not keeping pace with prices at all, and so their standards of living are eroding\u201d, Stantcheva said. \u201cInflation affects us as consumers, as workers, as asset holders, and also emotionally. And we see that lots of people, especially lower-income ones.\u201d</p> <p>Inflation peaked in the summer of 2022 at 9.1% \u2013 the highest it had been since the early \u201980s. It would take over two years for inflation to get back to levels under 3%. The Federal Reserve started ratcheting up interest rates, making the cost of borrowing money more expensive, to tackle rising prices. It has worked, but for many, the economic data and the reality of lived experiences have diverged.</p> <p>For economists, it seems likely that the Federal Reserve pulled off what they call a \u201csoft landing\u201d \u2013 a rare feat where inflation goes down, but the unemployment rate remains relatively low. The opposite, a \u201chard landing\u201d \u2013 which many economists had forecast \u2013 would have meant that unemployment would go up as inflation goes down, triggering a recession.</p> <p>But for many Americans, this is anything but a soft landing.</p> <p>Inflation coming down doesn\u2019t mean prices have come down, which would be deflation, something economic theory says would actually be a bad sign for the economy. So prices have and will remain elevated. Food prices, for example, <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=58350\">went up</a> 25% between 2019 and 2023, according to the US Department of Agriculture.</p> <p>The impact of higher interest rates has also taken time to ripple through the economy, so in addition to inflation, Americans are also still getting hit with high interest rates. As prices increased, so did the cost of buying a home, getting a loan for a car and the rates on credit card bills.</p> <p>What economists call a soft landing \u201cis diametrically opposed to ordinary Americans, who see themselves in the middle of turbulence\u201d, said John Gerzema, CEO of Harris Poll.</p> <p>While economists \u2013 and the Biden administration \u2013 celebrate low unemployment, it\u2019s harder for everyday Americans to appreciate the good news even if they still have their jobs.</p> <p>\u201cUnemployment is highly personal when it happens to you,\u201d Gerzema said. But for most people, unemployment is not a big factor in their lives. \u201cBut inflation is personal and persistent. Every week it\u2019s changing your benchmark.\u201d</p> <p>MaryKate, 25, who requested she be identified by only her first name for fear of professional repercussions, said that she is still living at home with her parents because rent has been too expensive. When she graduated from college in 2021, it took her a year to find a full-time job with benefits, and saving up to move out has been hard. She recently got financing for a new car, which she uses to commute to work.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t intend to be at home for this long,\u201d MaryKate said. \u201cIt\u2019s hindering my personal growth.\u201d</p> <p>MaryKate said she thinks about how her parents were able to move up from the lower middle class to a middle class during their life, and doesn\u2019t feel like the mobility they experienced is possible for her.</p> <p>\u201cAt least in my family, that was kind of always the thought, that the next generation does better than the previous one,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s necessarily going to be the case for me.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a sentiment that many Americans share. In the September Harris/Guardian poll, 42% of Americans said they are not financially better off today than their parents were at their age.</p> <p>The one thing that Donald Trump and Kamala Harris seem to agree on is that inflation has hurt Americans, and they are acting accordingly. It\u2019s why Trump proposed ending taxes on tips at a rally in Las Vegas and Harris has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/16/kamala-harris-opportunity-economy-plan\">shifted her emphasis away</a> from Bidenomics \u2013 investing in infrastructure, boosting the US chip industry \u2013 to putting housing costs and crackdowns on price gouging at the center of her economic proposals.</p> <p>Gerzema says these kinds of policies are \u201cpersonally relevant appeals\u201d that focus on the granular \u201cpixels\u201d of the economy, not the overall picture. Purchasing power, personal sentiment on job security, student loans, the price of gas \u2013 are all pixels that make up the picture of a person\u2019s individual economy.</p> <p>\u201cI think the pixels just become so incredibly important because when you look at those, you really start to understand a different picture,\u201d Gerzema said.</p> <p>Both presidential candidates seem to understand that much of the election hinges on these emotions. This week, voters will choose who they think has understood them best.</p>",

She recently got financing for a new car, which she uses to commute to work. \u201cI didn\u2019t intend to be at home for this long,\u201d MaryKate said. \u201cIt\u2019s hindering my personal growth.\u201d MaryKate said she thinks about how her parents were able to move up from the lower middle class to a middle class during their life, and doesn\u2019t feel like the mobility they experienced is possible for her. \u201cAt least in my family, that was kind of always the thought, that the next generation does better than the previous one,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s necessarily going to be the case for me.\u201d It\u2019s a sentiment that many Americans share. In the September Harris/Guardian poll, 42% of Americans said they are not financially better off today than their parents were at their age. The one thing that Donald Trump and Kamala Harris seem to agree on is that inflation has hurt Americans, and they are acting accordingly. It\u2019s why Trump proposed ending taxes on tips at a rally in Las Vegas and Harris has shifted her emphasis away from Bidenomics \u2013 investing in infrastructure, boosting the US chip industry \u2013 to putting housing costs and crackdowns on price gouging at the center of her economic proposals. Gerzema says these kinds of policies are \u201cpersonally relevant appeals\u201d that focus on the granular \u201cpixels\u201d of the economy, not the overall picture. Purchasing power, personal sentiment on job security, student loans, the price of gas \u2013 are all pixels that make up the picture of a person\u2019s individual economy. \u201cI think the pixels just become so incredibly important because when you look at those, you really start to understand a different picture,\u201d Gerzema said. Both presidential candidates seem to understand that much of the election hinges on these emotions. This week, voters will choose who they think has understood them best.",

Appearing at estimates for the first time since his appointment in June, Kean argued with the independent senator Gerard Rennick about the cost of nuclear, telling the hearing: \u201cIf you want to see who are needing rent-seeking [and] trying to pull one over the eyes of the Australian public, it\u2019s the nuclear industry.\u201d Kean said the nuclear industry was \u201cthere propping up the coal industry, who want to extend their business models, squeeze out the last bits of profit at the expense of Australian consumers\u201d. He also clashed with the Nationals senator Ross Cadell over analysis by Australia\u2019s science agency CSIRO, which found nuclear was the most expensive form of large-scale energy available, estimating an initial plant could cost more than $16bn. Kean told Cadell \u201cmost rational people do trust the CSIRO, this is the body that developed wifi\u201d and that their advice \u201cis good enough for me and it should be good enough for our political leaders\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Cadell responded by accusing the authority chair of not questioning things or looking for truth. \u201cI know you\u2019re trying to get your grabs up on Sky at the moment,\u201d Kean told the senator. He later told Rennick that advice from CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator was that the cheapest way to replace Australia\u2019s ageing electricity infrastructure was with renewables. The Coalition has proposed seven sites where it says it would eventually replace coal-fired power plants with nuclear plants but not how much this would cost. Multiple energy analysts have argued nuclear energy would be more expensive than other options and a nuclear industry would not be possible in Australia until after 2040. The bulk of the country\u2019s coal plants are scheduled to close in the 2030s. The opposition has suggested it would limit the rollout of large-scale renewable energy \u2013 it has criticised Labor\u2019s goal of 82% renewable energy by 2030 \u2013 and bridge the gap by keeping ageing coal plants running longer and using more gas-fired power. With nuclear banned, gas is the most expensive form of electricity in the national electricity market and its use is largely restricted to \u201cpeaking\u201d power turned on only when needed. It provided less than 3% of electricity in the national grid over the past month. The chair of the Australian Energy Regulator, Clare Savage, told a parliamentary inquiry she did not believe nuclear plants could be built in time to cover the closure of coal-fired power plants.",

Dan Campbell\u2019s culture. The aggressive fourth-down calls. A pass rush that is still sizzling despite losing Aidan Hutchinson for the season. The team\u2019s versatile secondary. The \u201c<a href=\"https://www.si.com/nfl/lions/news/sonic-and-knuckles-emerge-in-lions-offense\">Sonic and Knuckles</a>\u201d running back duo. Ben Johnson\u2019s creative play-calling. The best offensive line in the NFL. But it\u2019s time to recognize the person who makes it all tick: Jared Goff.</p> <p>The 30-year-old may not be the best quarterback in the NFL, but he\u2019s perfect for these Lions. And with each passing week this season, he continues to climb up the quarterback ladder. In two seasons, he\u2019s gone from a quarterback that a team can win in spite of to <em>the</em> foundational piece for a franchise with Super Bowl expectations.</p> <p>On Sunday, he completed 18 of 22 passes for 145 yards in gnarly conditions, throwing a crucial touchdown on fourth down to cap Detroit\u2019s opening drive. It was vintage Goff, a quarterback in complete command of the offense, refusing to take negative plays and keeping the offense on schedule, offering a timely reminder that good quarterback play often resides in the absence of spectacle. He may not always produce fireworks, but in the parlance of shouty, TV talking heads: Goff plays winning football.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Lions/status/1853231553859780768\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Love to hear it \ud83d\ude01<br><br>JA-RED GOFF, JA-RED GOFF, JA-RED GOFF <a href=\"https://t.co/UNqHIC53Fl\">pic.twitter.com/UNqHIC53Fl</a></p>&mdash; Detroit Lions (@Lions) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lions/status/1853231553859780768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 4, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>When asked recently about what the team saw in Goff when they traded for the quarterback in 2021, Campbell pointed to his head and then chest. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes him a dangerous player,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cIt\u2019s what makes him one of these guys you can build around because he\u2019s a winner, man. He will find a way to win.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to say Goff is merely a product of the Lions\u2019 healthy ecosystem. But this season he has elevated his play to a different level. Since week three, he\u2019s been nearly perfect, completing 106 of his last 128 pass attempts for an eye-popping 82.8% completion percentage. In their last six games, the Lions have scored more touchdowns than Goff has had incompletions.</p> <p>Having a talented group of skill players and a bruising offensive line helps, but it\u2019s the quarterback who knits it all together. The old doubts about his game \u2013 that he\u2019s too conservative, crumbles under pressure or can\u2019t break down complex defenses \u2013 have evaporated as the Lions offense has scorched all before it. Two weeks ago, it was dicing up Brian Flores\u2019 blitz-heavy defense. This week, it was picking on a depleted Packers secondary, getting rid of the ball before the pass-rushing hounds could get close to the backfield.</p> <p>While other quarterbacks can freelance with their legs, relying on their physical gifts to extend plays or launch throws downfield, Goff prides himself on unceasing efficiency. Even as the position evolves, with every team chasing a dynamic playmaker who can create on his own, Goff continues to show that rhythm and accuracy are the bedrocks of quarterbacking \u2013 and can render some of the world\u2019s greatest athletes utterly helpless.</p> <p>If you\u2019re looking for signs of maturity, it comes against pressure. Early in his career, Goff would fold when things got messy. He would either toss up panicked throws or hold on to the ball too long, taking drive-ending sacks. But this season Goff has been the best quarterback in the league under pressure, completing 67% of his passes when harried. No other quarterback in the league has cracked the 62% mark. And it\u2019s not as if Goff is relying on cheap, easy throws underneath; he sits second in the league in yards per attempt when pressured, behind only Joe Burrow.</p> <p>Sunday was not Goff\u2019s best game this season. In many ways, it was a quintessential Goff performance, relying on his run game to do the heavy lifting and then getting the ball out quickly to keep the offense chugging along. But playing in a downpour on the road, it was what was required to get the win.</p> <p>The NFC North is a heavyweight brawl this year. But with the win on Sunday, the Lions have victories over the Packers and Vikings, putting them in prime position to take the division. Prepare yourself for the conversation: Jared Goff has cracked the league\u2019s top tier.</p> <h2><strong>MVP of the week</strong></h2> <p><strong>Lamar Jackson, quarterback, Baltimore Ravens.</strong> Jackson continues to tear the league apart. This season\u2019s MVP frontrunner torched the Broncos defense on Sunday, completing 16 of his 19 passes for 280 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions. It was the fourth time in Jackson\u2019s career that he\u2019s posted a perfect passer rating. That\u2019s even more impressive when you consider Denver\u2019s defense entered the week leading the NFL in all the dorkiest metrics.</p>    <p>With Derrick Henry in the backfield, Baltimore\u2019s offense now has the answers to any test. Load up to try to slow Jackson and Henry on the ground, and there is room for the quarterback to let it fly through the air. Sag off to stem the passing attack, and the defense gifts free runways for Henry to drive downhill. And Jackson plays with such command that he can toggle to whatever method he desires depending on how the defense looks pre-snap. Even the league\u2019s best defenses are struggling to find ways to clog the beautiful machine \u2013 against the Broncos it all felt \u2026 easy.</p> <p>There are still lingering questions about the Ravens\u2019 secondary and how well the team\u2019s offensive line can hold up in pass protection. But after <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671623\">clubbing the Broncos 41-10</a>, the 6-3 Ravens have that championship smell.</p> <h2><strong>Stat of the week</strong></h2>    <p>Daniel Jones continues to defy the laws of quarterback play. After <em>finally</em> scoring a touchdown at home for the <a href=\"https://x.com/BleacherReport/status/1853146219717042511\">first time in 672 days</a>, Jones offered us this doozy: He threw for more passing touchdowns (one) than yards (zero) in the first half against the Commanders, despite completing four of his six first-half passes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MySportsUpdate/status/1853156282418545040\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Daniel Jones in the first half:<br><br>- 4/6 passing<br>- 0 yards<br>- 1 TD <a href=\"https://t.co/BIJKrHjMF4\">pic.twitter.com/BIJKrHjMF4</a></p>&mdash; Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MySportsUpdate/status/1853156282418545040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 3, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>The performance in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671711\">the Giants\u2019 27-22 loss</a> was not as bleak as the stat line suggests. The Giants\u2019 plan was to shorten the game, running the ball to drain the clock and keep Washington\u2019s go-go offense on the sideline. Jones struggled to get anything going in the passing game but raced to 50 yards on the ground. After falling into a 21-7 half-time hole, though, the Giants let Jones rip it. And the quarterback responded by completing 16 of his 20 passes for 174 yards and a touchdown in the second-half, tacking on a rushing touchdown after running over a Commanders linebacker.</p> <p>Jones is not the future in New York. But he showed in the second-half on Sunday that he remains a more viable option for the Giants this season than backup Drew Lock.</p> <h2><strong>Video of the week</strong></h2> <p>And now for your weekly dose of Josh Allen Doing Bonkers Things:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1853173682811842971\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Josh Allen always improvising \u203c\ufe0f<br><br>\ud83d\udcfa: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MIAvsBUF?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MIAvsBUF</a> on CBS/Paramount+<br>\ud83d\udcf1: <a href=\"https://t.co/waVpO909ge\">https://t.co/waVpO909ge</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/s1qDvAvBbu\">pic.twitter.com/s1qDvAvBbu</a></p>&mdash; NFL (@NFL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1853173682811842971?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 3, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>If Jackson\u2019s MVP case is built around his new sense of control, then Allen\u2019s continues to be that he is the league\u2019s most pre-eminent improv artist.

But Bass was only within striking distance thanks to Allen\u2019s knack for creating something out of nothing.</p> <h2><strong>Elsewhere around the league</strong></h2> <p>\u2022 It\u2019s official: the Cowboys\u2019 season is a disaster. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671728\">The team\u2019s 27-21 defeat</a> to the Falcons had a little of everything: a <a href=\"https://x.com/SlaterNFL/status/1853070286587040098\">pre-game mutiny</a> from running back Ezekiel Elliott, coach Mike McCarthy <a href=\"https://x.com/NFLonFOX/status/1853147601660424456\">smashing his tablet on the sideline</a> and quarterback Dak Prescott leaving the game with a hamstring injury and a swollen throwing hand. Sometimes, you can spot, in real time, the moment a team\u2019s season goes off the rails. For the Cowboys, that came early in the third quarter, when the team <a href=\"https://x.com/SharpFootball/status/1853160354294956409\">attempted a fake punt</a> with punter Bryan Anger dropping back to pass. The Cowboys are paying Prescott <a href=\"https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/player/_/id/19089/dak-prescott\">$86m this season</a> to throw the football, and on a crucial fourth down they turned to their punter to move the chains \u2013 it was the Cowboys\u2019 deepest pass attempt in the first three quarters. Not content with that, McCarthy went for it on fourth down again later in the game, but the Cowboys were flagged for having 12 men on the field. The offseason cannot come quickly enough for Dallas, who have slumped to 3-5.</p>    <p>\u2022 After a pedestrian start to the season, Justin Herbert has found his groove. The Chargers <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671629\">pummeled the Browns 27-10</a>, with Herbert carving up a rickety Cleveland secondary. Tellingly, Herbert completed seven of his 12 passing attempts over 10 air yards, throwing for 196 yards and two touchdowns on downfield targets. Jim Harbaugh may be a quarterback guru, but early in his partnership with Herbert, the coach had effectively neutered a key part of the quarterback\u2019s game: throwing down the field. In the first five weeks of the season, Herbert had the lowest average depth of target of any starting quarterback in the league. But since the team\u2019s bye, Herbert has thrown for 100 yards or more on downfield attempts in three straight games. Take note: the old, swashbuckling, big play-hunting Herbert is back. Thanks, Jim!</p> <p>\u2022 Saquon Barkley is playing a different sport to everybody else in the league. Early in the second quarter against the Jaguars, Barkley caught a swing pass from Jalen Hurts near the sideline, made one defender miss, spun past a second would-be tackler and then jumped <em>backward </em>over a third defender. Yes, that is a real sentence. Barkley finished with 199 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671797\">a 28-23 win</a>.

      "bodyText": "The Detroit Lions are the best team in the NFL. They walked into a stormy Lambeau Field on Sunday and did what legitimate contenders do: handled their business against a talented yet inconsistent opponent, winning 24-14 on the road against the Packers. There is plenty of credit to go around. Dan Campbell\u2019s culture. The aggressive fourth-down calls. A pass rush that is still sizzling despite losing Aidan Hutchinson for the season. The team\u2019s versatile secondary. The \u201cSonic and Knuckles\u201d running back duo. Ben Johnson\u2019s creative play-calling. The best offensive line in the NFL. But it\u2019s time to recognize the person who makes it all tick: Jared Goff. The 30-year-old may not be the best quarterback in the NFL, but he\u2019s perfect for these Lions. And with each passing week this season, he continues to climb up the quarterback ladder. In two seasons, he\u2019s gone from a quarterback that a team can win in spite of to the foundational piece for a franchise with Super Bowl expectations. On Sunday, he completed 18 of 22 passes for 145 yards in gnarly conditions, throwing a crucial touchdown on fourth down to cap Detroit\u2019s opening drive. It was vintage Goff, a quarterback in complete command of the offense, refusing to take negative plays and keeping the offense on schedule, offering a timely reminder that good quarterback play often resides in the absence of spectacle. He may not always produce fireworks, but in the parlance of shouty, TV talking heads: Goff plays winning football.

Prepare yourself for the conversation: Jared Goff has cracked the league\u2019s top tier. MVP of the week Lamar Jackson, quarterback, Baltimore Ravens. Jackson continues to tear the league apart. This season\u2019s MVP frontrunner torched the Broncos defense on Sunday, completing 16 of his 19 passes for 280 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions. It was the fourth time in Jackson\u2019s career that he\u2019s posted a perfect passer rating. That\u2019s even more impressive when you consider Denver\u2019s defense entered the week leading the NFL in all the dorkiest metrics.

There are still lingering questions about the Ravens\u2019 secondary and how well the team\u2019s offensive line can hold up in pass protection. But after clubbing the Broncos 41-10, the 6-3 Ravens have that championship smell. Stat of the week Daniel Jones continues to defy the laws of quarterback play. After finally scoring a touchdown at home for the first time in 672 days, Jones offered us this doozy: He threw for more passing touchdowns (one) than yards (zero) in the first half against the Commanders, despite completing four of his six first-half passes. The performance in the Giants\u2019 27-22 loss was not as bleak as the stat line suggests.

Video of the week And now for your weekly dose of Josh Allen Doing Bonkers Things: If Jackson\u2019s MVP case is built around his new sense of control, then Allen\u2019s continues to be that he is the league\u2019s most pre-eminent improv artist. How many other quarterbacks in the league can flip a touchdown throw in the redzone while having their leg yanked by one defender while another wraps an arm around his neck? Other quarterbacks have natural playmaking instincts; Allen consistently straddles the line between chaos and genius. Even as he\u2019s matured, there are still times when watching Allen feels like someone has let a labrador loose on the field. It took a 61-yard field goal from Tyler Bass for the 7-2 Bills to eventually beat the Dolphins 30-27. But Bass was only within striking distance thanks to Allen\u2019s knack for creating something out of nothing. Elsewhere around the league \u2022 It\u2019s official: the Cowboys\u2019 season is a disaster. The team\u2019s 27-21 defeat to the Falcons had a little of everything: a pre-game mutiny from running back Ezekiel Elliott, coach Mike McCarthy smashing his tablet on the sideline and quarterback Dak Prescott leaving the game with a hamstring injury and a swollen throwing hand.

The accumulation of pain and sadness made my writings more emotional,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In 2021 she published her first poetry collection, What\u2019s Between Us is You,<em> </em>after her father found her poems and encouraged her to share them with the world.

      "bodyText": "As the sun sets over the streets of Mosul in northern Iraq, a group of young people gather in the basement of the Mosul Heritage Foundation to debate philosophy and literature. They are taking part in the city\u2019s only public reading club, in the war-ravaged Old City quarter on the west bank of the Tigris River. \u201cThe club allows me and other young people to discuss our ideas out loud without fear of society,\u201d says Rahma Salah al-Jubouri, a 29-year-old poet and teacher of disabled children, who has attended the weekly meetings for the past four months. \u201cI love thinking out loud but Iraqi society is very traditional,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt is not easy to talk about our problems or ideas.\u201d Like many of those present, Jubouri\u2019s passion for literature deepened during the three years that Islamic State (IS) occupied Mosul from 2014 to 2017. \u201cWe [women] lost all our rights under Isis. Everything was strictly controlled \u2013 our clothes, our ability to work, even the ability to buy phones,\u201d she says. During the nine-month battle for Mosul in 2016-17 between Iraqi forces and IS, Jubouri volunteered to help evacuate civilians fleeing the intense fighting across the Tigris to the liberated side of the city. During that time of chaos and destruction, she found solace in writing poetry at night in her room. \u201cSeeing these people desperate for help prompted me to keep writing. The accumulation of pain and sadness made my writings more emotional,\u201d she says. In 2021 she published her first poetry collection, What\u2019s Between Us is You, after her father found her poems and encouraged her to share them with the world. Since then, she has presented her work at Mosul\u2019s poetry festival and has published two more poetry collections, with a fourth to be released later this year. Mohamed al-Arab, a 30-year-old writer and government administrator, has been a regular at the weekly reading club since it started in 2022. His interest in literature also increased after IS took over the city. In September 2023, he published his debut book, The Last Gaze, a romantic novel. \u201cOften, writers are nourished by their pain,\u201d he says. \u201cEach of us has a unique story that cannot be described. We couldn\u2019t defend ourselves, and that\u2019s what drove us [young people] to express our deep sorrows and struggles through writing.\u201d Like Jubouri, Arab says the club provides a safe space to share his ideas with like-minded people, in keeping with Mosul\u2019s long and rich literary tradition. \u201cWe are trying our best to maintain the city\u2019s literary heritage so we can pass it on to the next generations,\u201d he says. In 2022, Wifaq Ahmed, 42, a civil engineer who advises Unesco on how to preserve the city\u2019s heritage, founded the cultural association Anqaa (\u201cphoenix\u201d), which hosts the reading club, as well as poetry nights and exhibitions. Initially, the club only had four members, including Ahmed, but now at least 30 come to each session, and sometimes up to 50. \u201cMore people are interested [in literature and arts] now. In fact, when I wrote the main goals [of Anqaa], my hope was to reach 50 people, but now we are talking about 500 members.\u201d Under IS rule, cultural activities related to literature, arts and sports were banned. Additionally, IS destroyed many cultural sites and works including burning more than 100,000 books and manuscripts at Mosul\u2019s Central Library in 2015, as part of its \u201ccultural cleansing\u201d campaign. \u201cPeople want the city to rise again,\u201d says Ahmed. \u201cWriting is the simplest weapon people have to save our identity [and] history, and restore social cohesion. We have a lot of people fighting to regain their lives and build new steps for the future.\u201d But it is not just the younger generation turning to literature to help revitalise the city\u2019s heritage. Dr Waleed al-Saraaf, a 59-year-old retired surgeon who has published poetry collections and a novel, believes that poets and writers have a role in combating the darkness of extremism. \u201cPoetry is important in Mosul because otherwise people will not understand what happened. Poetry goes beyond destroyed buildings \u2013 it reaches the depths of the human soul. Only the heart can see it, and this is the job of the poet,\u201d says Saraaf, sitting in Bytna Foundation, another arts and cultural centre completed in 2019. Saraaf\u2019s poems are scattered across 14 different landmarks such as the Al-Nabi Jarjis mosque and the Mosul Central Library, aiming to promote the peaceful nature of Islam. \u201cDuring Daesh [IS], I wrote about love, nature or anything non-political. Now, I write about the destruction of the city.\u201d Despite the defeat of IS in 2017, he believes there is still work to be done in combating radicalism. \u201cNow, there is no Daesh but we are still afraid that they will read what we wrote and kill us. There are sleeping cells; they are more dangerous because you don\u2019t know who they are or when they will come.\u201d For Mohammad al Attar, 47, a scholar advocating for the modernisation of Islam, writing is a form of resistance and therapy. He began writing after he was abducted and tortured in an IS prison for 105 days. \u201cI thought these were going to be my last days alive.

      "bodyText": "Kwame Kwei-Armah, the outgoing artistic director of the Young Vic, has warned that diversity in the theatre industry will regress if the government does not make urgent interventions to improve the provision of drama and art classes in schools. The director and dramatist has scripted a new Hercules musical that opens at Theatre Royal Drury Lane in London in June 2025, taking over the musical mantle at the theatre from Frozen. It will be his first major project since stepping down from the Young Vic earlier this year.

If R\u00faben Amorim was distracted from preparing Sporting for Manchester City on Tuesday, he will be more aware of a United squad bereft of confidence. United\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/03/vampirism-meets-overspend-to-make-death-football-of-late-stage-capitalism\">first 60 minutes against Chelsea</a> saw them fumble pathetically for creativity. Not even the presence of one of the club\u2019s greatest strikers has lifted the finishing quality in a group low on goals. Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford were both bereft of touch and instinct; substitute Joshua Zirkzee\u2019s signing remains a mystery. There was something of Van Nistelrooy in Rasmus H\u00f8jlund winning Bruno Fernandes\u2019s penalty, and the goalscorer\u2019s knee slide towards the tunnel at the Stretford End. But there was to be no Ferguson-era ecstatic denouement. This United don\u2019t do them. Van Nistelrooy has two games remaining until United seek the progressive future postponed by mistakenly retaining Erik ten Hag. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p> <h2><strong>Caicedo and Lavia boost Chelsea</strong></h2> <p>At Old Trafford, Mois\u00e9s Caicedo\u2019s thrashing stood out from a performance where Chelsea allowed victory to slip from their grip. Amid the desperately dull torpor of the first half, with Caicedo and Rom\u00e9o Lavia in midfield, Chelsea had control but Cole Palmer disappointed, against the club his family supports, as did Enzo Maresca\u2019s other attackers. It was left to Caicedo to motor through midfield in the style that has lately become customary. Transfer values of a combined \u00a3220m dictate his partnership with Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez needs to work but it is yet to. The Argentinian failed to get the better of even United\u2019s pedestrian midfield after replacing Lavia. With Lavia went Chelsea\u2019s thrust. Maresca has shown himself unafraid to sideline players the ownership wants to work out. He has carefully handled Mykhailo Mudryk\u2019s situation, for example. Lavia, if he can remain clear of injury, suits Chelsea\u2019s midfield far better in allowing Caicedo to be the player they paid top dollar for. <strong>JB</strong></p>    <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/03/manchester-united-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester United 1-1 Chelsea</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Gordon rolls back the years</strong></h2> <p>It was the sort of cross prefacing an unstoppable header that Nolberto Solano used to aim at Alan Shearer during Sir Bobby Robson\u2019s Newcastle tenure. Anthony Gordon prefers playing on the left so he can cut inside and shoot on his naturally stronger right side but there is a lot to be side for right-footed right wingers and Gordon excelled in that role as Arsenal\u2019s title hopes were dented. His assist for Alexander Isak\u2019s winner also renewed Newcastle\u2019s relationship with hope at the end of a week when they reached the Carabao Cup quarter-finals and clinched a first Premier League victory in six attempts. On a day when Gordon, Isak, Joe Willock, Sean Longstaff and Lewis Hall were strong man of the match contenders, all Eddie Howe lacked was a specialist centre-forward to understudy Isak. Significantly Newcastle\u2019s manager has sent the Swede\u2019s deputy, Callum Wilson, to the pioneering Doha hospital where Erling Haaland and Lionel Messi undergo physical repairs. If Wilson\u2019s back is mended, European qualification may beckon. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/02/newcastle-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">Newcastle 1-0 Arsenal</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Solanke makes the difference</strong></h2> <p>Dominic Solanke\u2019s value to Tottenham Hotspur will be measured by more than goals. The striker can mix it with defenders, link the play and lead his side\u2019s pressing. But for a side with a habit of throwing away points from winnable positions, having a ruthless striker is hardly something to be sniffy about. Spurs, who could once count on Harry Kane settling tight games, will have a better chance of finishing in the top four if Solanke is scoring. He made the difference during the 4-1 win over Aston Villa, notching his side\u2019s second and third goals, and could take satisfaction from outperforming his England teammate Ollie Watkins, who missed a glaring chance in the first half. \u201cThe goals are great and as a striker I\u2019m sure he loves the fact he\u2019s got a couple but I can\u2019t speak highly enough about him and what he brings to this team,\u201d Ange Postecoglou said. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/03/tottenham-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\">Tottenham 4-1 Aston Villa</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Every title contender needs a Gomez</strong></h2> <p>Arne Slot attributed Liverpool\u2019s transformation into a team worthy of leading the Premier League to a change in attitude against Brighton, more than his own tactical switches, and it was Joe Gomez who embodied the fight, quality and character that had been sorely missing from their first-half display. The defender was introduced at the break after Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 sustained an arm injury when Virgil van Dijk landed on him and was a major factor in extinguishing Brighton\u2019s threat. For a player who was left out of Slot\u2019s first Premier League squad at Ipswich, and whose Liverpool future was in serious doubt in the summer, Gomez\u2019s attitude and professionalism is exemplary. He is what a title contender needs. \u201cI know he came from an interesting summer,\u201d said Van Dijk. \u201cBut the way he has been on and off the pitch is remarkable. He\u2019s so respected within the club and the team. He\u2019s a fantastic player and he showed it again. He was outstanding.\u201d <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/02/liverpool-brighton-premier-league-match-report\">Liverpool 2-1 Brighton</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Clock ticks rapidly for O\u2019Neil</strong></h2> <p>Statistics that straddle seasons can often feel pointless \u2013 or at least unfair \u2013 but it is growing hard to ignore the numbers surrounding Wolves. Gary O\u2019Neil\u2019s side have won one of their past 20 league matches, taking eight points from a possible 60 in that period. Matheus Cunha and Jo\u00e3o Gomes exhibited moments of brilliance in Saturday\u2019s draw with Crystal Palace to prove it is not all bad but O\u2019Neil, who signed a four-year contract extension in the summer, is running out of time to turn things around. Sections of supporters aired their grievances during the game and failure to beat Southampton on Saturday will almost certainly spell the end. Regardless, Wolves are in a relegation fight for the long haul. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to scrap all season, we\u2019re going to have to fight, that\u2019s the situation we\u2019re in,\u201d O\u2019Neil said. \u201cWe\u2019ve accepted that in the dressing room.\u201d <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/02/wolves-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">Wolves 2-2 Crystal Palace</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Iraola\u2019s hard workers stun champions</strong></h2> <p>No need for panic after Manchester City\u2019s first Premier League defeat of the season, though several concerns. If Bournemouth deserved huge credit, with Antoine Semenyo, Lewis Cook and Milos Kerkez the outstanding players, it was a combination of energy and desire that took apart the champions. Too often, in the press, in the duels and even in the latter stages when City at last exerted some control, it was a Bournemouth player first to the ball. Few would accuse a serial champion squad of lacking desire but in the performances of Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, Mateo Kovacic and Kyle Walker, age reared its head. Andoni Iraola fielded Semenyo so Walker would be the winger\u2019s immediate adversary. The Ghanaian so roasted Walker that Pep Guardiola had to shift his raddled captain to centre-back. Kevin De Bruyne on the bench had been a surprise but he did not play. <strong>JB</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/02/bournemouth-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Bournemouth 2-1 Manchester City</a></em></p></li> </ul>    <h2><strong>Fabulous Forest into the top three</strong></h2> <p>Ten games in and Nottingham Forest have conceded only seven goals in the league. It is an incredible feat for a team who survived in the Premier League on the final day last season. The two additions to have changed the back four are Nikola Milenkovic and \u00c0lex Moreno. Matz Sels, Ola Aina and Murillo were already impressing under Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo but they were given the perfect additions to make Forest robust and balanced at the back. It is an indication that if things are not going well, tweaking is often better than overhauling and Forest are being proven right for their more sensible approach in the market rather than hiring a completely new defence. West Ham had a meagre three shots on Saturday and only one of those was on target as Forest moved into the top three.<strong> Will Unwin</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/02/nottingham-forest-west-ham-premier-league-match-report\">Nottingham Forest 3-0 West Ham</a></em></p></li> </ul>    <h2><strong>Southampton finally shore up defence</strong></h2> <p>Aaron Ramsdale believes Southampton\u2019s performance against Everton showed their togetherness as they picked up a long-awaited first Premier League victory of the season. Ramsdale pulled off several impressive saves before Adam Armstrong\u2019s late winner to outshine England rival Jordan Pickford at the other end but paid tribute to the rest of his defence for their contribution to a first clean sheet of the campaign. \u201cIt was a real team effort,\u201d said Ramsdale. \u201cIt feels great to get that off our chests, especially the first win. That was more important than the clean sheet but to get both together shows that we are really working for the team. The defenders dealing with Everton\u2019s threat which they\u2019re so good at. If they got through I was thankful I was there and they are the standards I hold myself by. That was the real Aaron Ramsdale the Saints fans saw.\u201d <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/02/southampton-everton-premier-league-match-report\">Southampton 1-0 Everton</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Tractor Boys plough on but need win</strong></h2> <p>Ipswich arrived in the brave new world of the Premier League without great expectation, so to have suggested to supporters that their team would avoid defeat in half their opening 10 games would have been an appealing prophecy. Yet five draws and five defeats means the Tractor Boys are one of two teams still without a win and they are letting points slip through their fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s 10 games we haven\u2019t won, but five from which we got a result, and probably eight that we competed in,\u201d Kieran McKenna wisely surmised after Leicester snatched a late 1-1 draw at Portman Road, while also voicing some legitimate complaints in the direction of VAR and the referee Tim Robinson. Yet the contrast with fellow new boys Leicester \u2013 who are finding ways to grind out important points \u2013 is stark. Whereas Steve Cooper\u2019s side have retrieved six points from losing positions already, Ipswich keep throwing them away. <strong>Dominic Booth</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a

Regardless, Wolves are in a relegation fight for the long haul. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to scrap all season, we\u2019re going to have to fight, that\u2019s the situation we\u2019re in,\u201d O\u2019Neil said. \u201cWe\u2019ve accepted that in the dressing room.\u201d Ben Fisher Match report: Wolves 2-2 Crystal Palace Iraola\u2019s hard workers stun champions No need for panic after Manchester City\u2019s first Premier League defeat of the season, though several concerns. If Bournemouth deserved huge credit, with Antoine Semenyo, Lewis Cook and Milos Kerkez the outstanding players, it was a combination of energy and desire that took apart the champions. Too often, in the press, in the duels and even in the latter stages when City at last exerted some control, it was a Bournemouth player first to the ball. Few would accuse a serial champion squad of lacking desire but in the performances of Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, Mateo Kovacic and Kyle Walker, age reared its head. Andoni Iraola fielded Semenyo so Walker would be the winger\u2019s immediate adversary. The Ghanaian so roasted Walker that Pep Guardiola had to shift his raddled captain to centre-back. Kevin De Bruyne on the bench had been a surprise but he did not play. JB Match report: Bournemouth 2-1 Manchester City Fabulous Forest into the top three Ten games in and Nottingham Forest have conceded only seven goals in the league. It is an incredible feat for a team who survived in the Premier League on the final day last season. The two additions to have changed the back four are Nikola Milenkovic and \u00c0lex Moreno. Matz Sels, Ola Aina and Murillo were already impressing under Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo but they were given the perfect additions to make Forest robust and balanced at the back. It is an indication that if things are not going well, tweaking is often better than overhauling and Forest are being proven right for their more sensible approach in the market rather than hiring a completely new defence. West Ham had a meagre three shots on Saturday and only one of those was on target as Forest moved into the top three. Will Unwin Match report: Nottingham Forest 3-0 West Ham Southampton finally shore up defence Aaron Ramsdale believes Southampton\u2019s performance against Everton showed their togetherness as they picked up a long-awaited first Premier League victory of the season. Ramsdale pulled off several impressive saves before Adam Armstrong\u2019s late winner to outshine England rival Jordan Pickford at the other end but paid tribute to the rest of his defence for their contribution to a first clean sheet of the campaign. \u201cIt was a real team effort,\u201d said Ramsdale. \u201cIt feels great to get that off our chests, especially the first win. That was more important than the clean sheet but to get both together shows that we are really working for the team. The defenders dealing with Everton\u2019s threat which they\u2019re so good at. If they got through I was thankful I was there and they are the standards I hold myself by. That was the real Aaron Ramsdale the Saints fans saw.\u201d Ed Aarons Match report: Southampton 1-0 Everton Tractor Boys plough on but need win Ipswich arrived in the brave new world of the Premier League without great expectation, so to have suggested to supporters that their team would avoid defeat in half their opening 10 games would have been an appealing prophecy. Yet five draws and five defeats means the Tractor Boys are one of two teams still without a win and they are letting points slip through their fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s 10 games we haven\u2019t won, but five from which we got a result, and probably eight that we competed in,\u201d Kieran McKenna wisely surmised after Leicester snatched a late 1-1 draw at Portman Road, while also voicing some legitimate complaints in the direction of VAR and the referee Tim Robinson. Yet the contrast with fellow new boys Leicester \u2013 who are finding ways to grind out important points \u2013 is stark. Whereas Steve Cooper\u2019s side have retrieved six points from losing positions already, Ipswich keep throwing them away. Dominic Booth Match report: Ipswich 1-1 Leicester City",

      "body": "<p>Quincy Jones, a titan of American entertainment who worked with stars from Frank Sinatra to Michael Jackson and Will Smith, has died aged 91.</p> \n<p>Jones\u2019 publicist, Arnold Robinson, said he died on Sunday night at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his family.</p> \n<p>\u201cTonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones\u2019 passing,\u201d the family said in a statement. \u201cAnd although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jones was arguably the most versatile pop cultural figure of the 20th century, perhaps best known for producing the albums Off the Wall, Thriller and Bad for Michael Jackson in the 1980s, which made the singer the biggest pop star of all time. Jones also produced music for Sinatra, Aretha Franklin, Donna Summer and many others.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/feb/22/quincy-jones-greatest-ever-moments-ranked\">He was also a successful composer</a> of dozens of film scores, and had numerous chart hits under his own name. Jones was a bandleader in big band jazz, an arranger for jazz stars including Count Basie, and a multi-instrumentalist, most proficiently on trumpet and piano. His TV and film production company, founded in 1990, had major success with the sitcom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/aug/11/the-fresh-prince-of-bel-air-reboot\">The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</a> and other shows, and he continued to innovate well into his 80s, launching Qwest TV in 2017, an on-demand music TV service. Jones is third only to Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z for having the most Grammy award nominations of all time \u2013 80 to their 88 each \u2013 and is the awards\u2019 third most-garlanded winner, with 28.</p> \n<p>Among those paying tribute to Jones was Joe Biden, who called him a \u201cmusical genius who transformed the soul of America \u2013 one beat, one rhythm, and one rhyme at a time \u2026 Quincy Jones solidified Black culture as American culture\u201d. </p> \n<p>Playwright and actor Jeremy O Harris paid tribute to Jones\u2019s \u201climitless\u201d contributions to US culture, writing: \u201cWhat couldn\u2019t he do? Quincy Jones, literally born when the limits on how big a black boy could dream were unfathomably high, taught us that the limit does not exist.\u201d</p> \n<p>Actor Michael Caine was born on the same day as Jones \u2013 14 March 1933 \u2013 and wrote: \u201cMy celestial twin Quincy was a titan in the musical world. He was a wonderful and unique human being, lucky to have known him.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jones was born in Chicago. His half-white father had been born to a <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/quincy-jones-has-a-story\">Welsh slave owner and one of his female slaves</a>, while his mother\u2019s family were also descended from slave owners. His introduction to music came through the walls of his childhood home from a piano played by a neighbour, which he started learning aged seven, and via his mother\u2019s singing.</p> \n<p>His parents divorced and he moved with his father to Washington state, where Jones learned drums and a host of brass instruments in his high-school band. At 14, he started playing in a band with a 16-year-old Ray Charles in Seattle clubs, once, in 1948, backing Billie Holiday. He studied music at Seattle University, transferring east to continue in Boston, and then moved to New York after being rehired by the jazz bandleader Lionel Hampton, with whom he had toured as a high-schooler (a band for which Malcolm X was a heroin dealer when they played in Detroit).</p> \n<p>In New York, one early gig was playing trumpet in Elvis Presley\u2019s band for his first TV appearances, and he met the stars of the flourishing bebop movement including Charlie Parker and Miles Davis. (Years later, in 1991, Jones conducted Davis\u2019s last performance, two months before he died.)</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f0c61797-2ea3-4183-bb34-b4d30175830e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ugwxBDflqb8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Jones toured Europe with Hampton, and spent much time there in the 1950s, including a period furthering his studies in Paris, where he met luminaries including Pablo Picasso, James Baldwin and Josephine Baker. At the age of 23, he also toured South America and the Middle East as Dizzy Gillespie\u2019s musical director and arranger. He convened a crack team for his own big band, touring Europe as a way to test Free and Easy, a jazz musical, but the disastrous run left Jones, by his own admission, close to suicide and with $100,000 of debt.</p> \n<p>He secured a job at Mercury Records and slowly paid off the debt with plenty of work as a producer and arranger for artists including Ella Fitzgerald, Dinah Washington, Peggy Lee, Sarah Vaughan and Sammy Davis Jr. He also began scoring films, his credits eventually including The Italian Job, In the Heat of the Night, The Getaway and The Color Purple. (He produced the last of these, which was nominated for 11 Oscars, three for Jones himself.) In 1968, he became the first African American to be nominated for best original song at the Oscars, for The Eyes of Love from the film Banning (alongside songwriter Bob Russell); he had seven nominations in total. For TV, he scored programmes such as The Bill Cosby Show, Ironside and Roots.</p> \n<p>His work with Sinatra began in 1958 when he was hired to conduct and arrange for Sinatra and his band by Grace Kelly, princess consort of Monaco, for a charity event. Jones and Sinatra continued working on projects until Sinatra\u2019s final album, LA Is My Lady, in 1984. Jones\u2019s solo musical career took off in the late 1950s, recording albums under his own name as bandleader for jazz ensembles that included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/sep/03/charles-mingus-black-saint\">luminaries such as Charles Mingus</a>, Art Pepper and Freddie Hubbard.</p> \n<p>Jones once said of his time in Seattle: \u201cWhen people write about the music, jazz is in this box, R&amp;B is in this box, pop is in this box, but we did everything,\u201d and his catholic tastes served him well as modern pop mutated out of the swing era. He produced four million-selling hits for the New York singer Lesley Gore in the mid-60s, including the US No 1 It\u2019s My Party, and later embraced funk and disco, producing hit singles including George Benson\u2019s Give Me the Night and Patti Austin and James Ingram\u2019s Baby Come to Me, along with records by the band Rufus and Chaka Khan, and the Brothers Johnson. Jones also released his own funk material, scoring US Top 10 albums with Body Heat (1974) and The Dude (1981).</p> \n<p>His biggest success in this style was his work with Michael Jackson: Thriller remains the biggest selling album of all time, while Jones\u2019s versatility between Off the Wall and Bad allowed Jackson to metamorphose from lithe disco to ultra-synthetic funk-rock. He and Jackson (along with Lionel Richie and producer Michael Omartian) also helmed We Are the World, a successful charity single that raised funds for famine relief in Ethiopia in 1985. \u201cI\u2019ve lost my little brother today, and part of my soul has gone with him,\u201d Jones said when Jackson died in 2009. In 2017, Jones\u2019s legal team successfully argued that he was owed $9.4m in unpaid Jackson royalties, though he lost on appeal in 2020 and had to return $6.8m.</p> \n<p>After the success of The Color Purple in 1985, he formed the film and TV production company Quincy Jones Entertainment in 1990. His biggest screen hit was the sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, which ran for 148 episodes and launched the career of Will Smith; other shows included the LL Cool J sitcom In the House and the long-running sketch comedy show MadTV.</p> \n<p>He also created the media company Qwest Broadcasting and in 1993, the Black music magazine Vibe in partnership with Time Inc. Throughout his career he supported numerous charities and causes, including the , National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Jazz Foundation of America and others, and mentored young musicians including the British multiple Grammy winner Jacob Collier.</p> \n<p>Jones\u2019 illustrious career was twice nearly cut short: he narrowly avoided being killed by Charles Manson\u2019s cult in 1969, having planned to go to Sharon Tate\u2019s house on the night of the murders there, but Jones forgot the appointment. He also survived a brain aneurysm in 1974 that prevented him from playing the trumpet again in case the exertion caused further harm. </p> \n<p>Jones was married three times, first to his high-school girlfriend Jeri Caldwell, for nine years until 1966, fathering his daughter Jolie. In 1967, he married Ulla Andersson and had a son and daughter, divorcing in 1974 to marry actor Peggy Lipton, best known for roles in The Mod Squad and Twin Peaks. They had two daughters, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/02/rashida-jones-i-didnt-know-if-i-was-coming-or-going\">the actor Rashida Jones</a>, before divorcing in 1989. He had two further children: Rachel, with a dancer, Carol Reynolds, and Kenya, his daughter with actor Nastassja Kinski.</p> \n<p>He never remarried, but continued to date a string of younger women, raising eyebrows with his year-long partnership with 19-year-old Egyptian designer Heba Elawadi when he was 73. He has also claimed to have dated Ivanka Trump and Juliette Gr\u00e9co. He is survived by his seven children.</p> \n<p>Other artists paying tribute included LL Cool J, who wrote: \u201cYou were a father and example at a time when I truly needed a father and example. Mentor. Role model. King. You gave me opportunities and shared wisdom. Music would not be music without you.\u201d Femi Koleoso, bandleader with Mercury prize-winning jazz group Ezra Collective, called Jones a \u201cmasterful musician and beautiful soul\u201d.</p> \n<p>Nile Rodgers of Chic wrote \u201crest in power\u201d, describing Jones as a \u201cleader, teacher, spirit, pioneer\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Quincy Jones, a titan of American entertainment who worked with stars from Frank Sinatra to Michael Jackson and Will Smith, has died aged 91. Jones\u2019 publicist, Arnold Robinson, said he died on Sunday night at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his family. \u201cTonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones\u2019 passing,\u201d the family said in a statement. \u201cAnd although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.\u201d Jones was arguably the most versatile pop cultural figure of the 20th century, perhaps best known for producing the albums Off the Wall, Thriller and Bad for Michael Jackson in the 1980s, which made the singer the biggest pop star of all time. Jones also produced music for Sinatra, Aretha Franklin, Donna Summer and many others. He was also a successful composer of dozens of film scores, and had numerous chart hits under his own name. Jones was a bandleader in big band jazz, an arranger for jazz stars including Count Basie, and a multi-instrumentalist, most proficiently on trumpet and piano. His TV and film production company, founded in 1990, had major success with the sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and other shows, and he continued to innovate well into his 80s, launching Qwest TV in 2017, an on-demand music TV service. Jones is third only to Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z for having the most Grammy award nominations of all time \u2013 80 to their 88 each \u2013 and is the awards\u2019 third most-garlanded winner, with 28. Among those paying tribute to Jones was Joe Biden, who called him a \u201cmusical genius who transformed the soul of America \u2013 one beat, one rhythm, and one rhyme at a time \u2026 Quincy Jones solidified Black culture as American culture\u201d. Playwright and actor Jeremy O Harris paid tribute to Jones\u2019s \u201climitless\u201d contributions to US culture, writing: \u201cWhat couldn\u2019t he do? Quincy Jones, literally born when the limits on how big a black boy could dream were unfathomably high, taught us that the limit does not exist.\u201d Actor Michael Caine was born on the same day as Jones \u2013 14 March 1933 \u2013 and wrote: \u201cMy celestial twin Quincy was a titan in the musical world. He was a wonderful and unique human being, lucky to have known him.\u201d Jones was born in Chicago. His half-white father had been born to a Welsh slave owner and one of his female slaves, while his mother\u2019s family were also descended from slave owners. His introduction to music came through the walls of his childhood home from a piano played by a neighbour, which he started learning aged seven, and via his mother\u2019s singing. His parents divorced and he moved with his father to Washington state, where Jones learned drums and a host of brass instruments in his high-school band. At 14, he started playing in a band with a 16-year-old Ray Charles in Seattle clubs, once, in 1948, backing Billie Holiday. He studied music at Seattle University, transferring east to continue in Boston, and then moved to New York after being rehired by the jazz bandleader Lionel Hampton, with whom he had toured as a high-schooler (a band for which Malcolm X was a heroin dealer when they played in Detroit). In New York, one early gig was playing trumpet in Elvis Presley\u2019s band for his first TV appearances, and he met the stars of the flourishing bebop movement including Charlie Parker and Miles Davis. (Years later, in 1991, Jones conducted Davis\u2019s last performance, two months before he died.) Jones toured Europe with Hampton, and spent much time there in the 1950s, including a period furthering his studies in Paris, where he met luminaries including Pablo Picasso, James Baldwin and Josephine Baker. At the age of 23, he also toured South America and the Middle East as Dizzy Gillespie\u2019s musical director and arranger. He convened a crack team for his own big band, touring Europe as a way to test Free and Easy, a jazz musical, but the disastrous run left Jones, by his own admission, close to suicide and with $100,000 of debt. He secured a job at Mercury Records and slowly paid off the debt with plenty of work as a producer and arranger for artists including Ella Fitzgerald, Dinah Washington, Peggy Lee, Sarah Vaughan and Sammy Davis Jr. He also began scoring films, his credits eventually including The Italian Job, In the Heat of the Night, The Getaway and The Color Purple. (He produced the last of these, which was nominated for 11 Oscars, three for Jones himself.) In 1968, he became the first African American to be nominated for best original song at the Oscars, for The Eyes of Love from the film Banning (alongside songwriter Bob Russell); he had seven nominations in total. For TV, he scored programmes such as The Bill Cosby Show, Ironside and Roots. His work with Sinatra began in 1958 when he was hired to conduct and arrange for Sinatra and his band by Grace Kelly, princess consort of Monaco, for a charity event. Jones and Sinatra continued working on projects until Sinatra\u2019s final album, LA Is My Lady, in 1984. Jones\u2019s solo musical career took off in the late 1950s, recording albums under his own name as bandleader for jazz ensembles that included luminaries such as Charles Mingus, Art Pepper and Freddie Hubbard. Jones once said of his time in Seattle: \u201cWhen people write about the music, jazz is in this box, R&amp;B is in this box, pop is in this box, but we did everything,\u201d and his catholic tastes served him well as modern pop mutated out of the swing era. He produced four million-selling hits for the New York singer Lesley Gore in the mid-60s, including the US No 1 It\u2019s My Party, and later embraced funk and disco, producing hit singles including George Benson\u2019s Give Me the Night and Patti Austin and James Ingram\u2019s Baby Come to Me, along with records by the band Rufus and Chaka Khan, and the Brothers Johnson. Jones also released his own funk material, scoring US Top 10 albums with Body Heat (1974) and The Dude (1981). His biggest success in this style was his work with Michael Jackson: Thriller remains the biggest selling album of all time, while Jones\u2019s versatility between Off the Wall and Bad allowed Jackson to metamorphose from lithe disco to ultra-synthetic funk-rock. He and Jackson (along with Lionel Richie and producer Michael Omartian) also helmed We Are the World, a successful charity single that raised funds for famine relief in Ethiopia in 1985. \u201cI\u2019ve lost my little brother today, and part of my soul has gone with him,\u201d Jones said when Jackson died in 2009. In 2017, Jones\u2019s legal team successfully argued that he was owed $9.4m in unpaid Jackson royalties, though he lost on appeal in 2020 and had to return $6.8m. After the success of The Color Purple in 1985, he formed the film and TV production company Quincy Jones Entertainment in 1990. His biggest screen hit was the sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, which ran for 148 episodes and launched the career of Will Smith; other shows included the LL Cool J sitcom In the House and the long-running sketch comedy show MadTV. He also created the media company Qwest Broadcasting and in 1993, the Black music magazine Vibe in partnership with Time Inc. Throughout his career he supported numerous charities and causes, including the , National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Jazz Foundation of America and others, and mentored young musicians including the British multiple Grammy winner Jacob Collier. Jones\u2019 illustrious career was twice nearly cut short: he narrowly avoided being killed by Charles Manson\u2019s cult in 1969, having planned to go to Sharon Tate\u2019s house on the night of the murders there, but Jones forgot the appointment. He also survived a brain aneurysm in 1974 that prevented him from playing the trumpet again in case the exertion caused further harm. Jones was married three times, first to his high-school girlfriend Jeri Caldwell, for nine years until 1966, fathering his daughter Jolie. In 1967, he married Ulla Andersson and had a son and daughter, divorcing in 1974 to marry actor Peggy Lipton, best known for roles in The Mod Squad and Twin Peaks. They had two daughters, including the actor Rashida Jones, before divorcing in 1989. He had two further children: Rachel, with a dancer, Carol Reynolds, and Kenya, his daughter with actor Nastassja Kinski. He never remarried, but continued to date a string of younger women, raising eyebrows with his year-long partnership with 19-year-old Egyptian designer Heba Elawadi when he was 73. He has also claimed to have dated Ivanka Trump and Juliette Gr\u00e9co. He is survived by his seven children. Other artists paying tribute included LL Cool J, who wrote: \u201cYou were a father and example at a time when I truly needed a father and example. Mentor. Role model. King. You gave me opportunities and shared wisdom. Music would not be music without you.\u201d Femi Koleoso, bandleader with Mercury prize-winning jazz group Ezra Collective, called Jones a \u201cmasterful musician and beautiful soul\u201d. Nile Rodgers of Chic wrote \u201crest in power\u201d, describing Jones as a \u201cleader, teacher, spirit, pioneer\u201d.",

Independent MPs Allegra Spender and Kate Chaney have quit their Qantas Chairman\u2019s Lounge membership as the fallout from Anthony Albanese\u2019s flight upgrades rolls on. Spender\u2019s move was labelled \u201cgrandstanding\u201d by the Labor MP Luke Gosling. Westpac delivered a $7bn profit as more mortgage holders fell behind. In question time, Peter Dutton accused the government of \u201creckless spending\u201d to reduce student debt. Also in QT, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said his shadow counterpart, Angus Taylor, should acknowledge the latest \u201cvery encouraging\u201d inflation data. The acting secretary of the Department of Parliamentary Services, Jaala Hinchcliffe, confirmed the National Anti-Corruption Commission executed warrants on the department last month, as first revealed by Guardian Australia. The far-right provocateur Candace Owens has demanded the Australian government overturn its rejection of her visa for a planned national speaking tour. Finally, the search for an 11-year-old boy swept out to sea is to enter its third day. As ever, thank you for joining us. We\u2019ll be back again bright and early tomorrow. Search for boy swept out to sea on Central Coast set to enter third day The land, air and sea search for an 11-year-old boy who was carried out to sea on the New South Wales Central Coast has been paused for the day. The 11-year-old was walking with his three siblings and father at The Entrance when disaster struck about 5pm on Sunday. AAP is reporting that the extensive search was called off at 4pm and that crews are set to return at 8am on Tuesday. The family was visiting from Sydney and fishing in the area when it\u2019s believed they took a shortcut across a channel between an estuary and the ocean before the boy was swept away while the tide was going out. Financial distress drives record crisis call numbers Record numbers of Australians experiencing financial hardship are contacting crisis support services, as the soaring cost of living takes a toll on people\u2019s mental health. Lifeline has received 110,000 calls related to financial distress so far in 2024, including calls about financial management, employment and homelessness, AAP reports. The service\u2019s highest-ever daily demand was recorded on 7 October, when it received 4,405 calls and messages. It eclipsed the previous one-day benchmark of 4,396, set a week earlier in September, when the service recorded four of its 10 busiest days to date, with eight of the busiest 10 in 2024. Lifeline Australia chief executive, Colin Seery, said the service was doing everything it could to keep up with the unprecedented demand. \u201cIn the face of consistent cost-of-living pressures, we are seeing people having to make impossible choices, like should they pay the rent or should they pay their power or insurance bill?\u201d he said on Monday. Add to these multiple other factors happening at the same time, from domestic and family violence and social isolation to extreme weather and events overseas, and you can begin to understand why levels of anxiety and distress are on the rise. Lifeline has never been needed more. \u2022 In Australia, support is available at Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636, Lifeline on 13 11 14, and at MensLine on 1300 789 978. Job ads tick higher in another sign of resilience of Australia\u2019s labour market The Reserve Bank board has been meeting today to consider what to do with the key interest rate, with a decision to land tomorrow at 2.30pm AEDT. (Half an hour later, there\u2019s the Melbourne Cup.) The board will probably leave the cash rate at 4.35%, marking a year since its most recent move (a rate rise, in case you\u2019ve forgotten). One reason for caution about cutting is that the labour market is doing a bit better than the RBA had expected (as we saw with the September jobs growth). Job advertisements, meanwhile, perked up a bit last month for a second in a row, according to ANZ and Indeed: \u201cThis suggests the downward trend in Job Ads may be stabilising,\u201d said ANZ economist Madeline Dunk. \u201cEmployment growth has averaged 45,000 over the past six months, the participation rate is at a record high, and the unemployment rate remains relatively low at 4.1%.\u201d An increase in services inflation in the September quarter (even as the headline CPI figures fell) is another reason why the RBA is likely to be cautious about cutting borrowing costs until it\u2019s confident price pressures are really ebbing. Of course, the RBA (and many others) will be monitoring what fallout \u2013 if any \u2013 might emerge from this week\u2019s US elections. Any disruption in the world\u2019s biggest economy can\u2019t be anticipated by the board but the threat of it looms as a cloud over this week\u2019s gathering. Andrew Giles says it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll cancel his Chairman\u2019s Lounge access Andrew Giles, the minister for skills and training, says he has not given his Qantas Chairman\u2019s Lounge access much thought. He has just told the ABC: I haven\u2019t given that matter any particular thought. I haven\u2019t made any decision about removing it, I don\u2019t think I will. Individual members will make their choices. I\u2019m much more focused on the decisions I make for Australians than issues like that. Labor MP Luke Gosling and Liberal MP Casey Aaron Violi have both signalled they will not give up their Chairman\u2019s Lounge access and that the move by Allegra Spender \u2013 who said she will cancel her membership \u2013 was \u201cgrandstanding\u201d from members who are not so reliant on long-distance flights for their work. Gosling told the ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing: If they want to start talking to people from regional parts of Australia like where I live \u2026 I\u2019ll give you a quick example \u2026 I had an event over the weekend, I got on the flight at midnight in Darwin like a lot of people have to do in Darwin. [I] flew down, was able to have a quick shave before I went out to an event down on the east coast, but it takes about eight hours. It\u2019s a bit rich from the people with harbour views who either drive or have less than a one-hour flight \u2026 [They\u2019re] just trying to grandstand, like the independents often do. Origin asked about \u2018vested interest\u2019 Back to that Ceda meeting in Sydney, where, as it happened, your Guardian correspondent was the event \u201cfacilitator\u201d. We couldn\u2019t help asking the first question about Origin\u2019s own \u201cvested interest\u201d, not least because it\u2019s a big electricity generator and retailer and happens to own a chunk of APLNG, one of Australia\u2019s biggest gas producers and exporters. We also couldn\u2019t help noting UBS, an investment bank, had recently landed on the view that APLNG \u201ccould produce more [gas]\u201d but \u201cit runs the risk of Government forcing [the exporter] to offer surplus production into the (lower value) domestic market\u201d. Calabria said \u201cwe don\u2019t have gas to spare\u201d. \u201cSo I stand proudly here about it, playing a very, very important role for domestic customers, and has always done so,\u201d he said. It is actually producing at quite high capacity levels today without further capital investment. Still, given we export more than three-quarters of gas produced in eastern states, it\u2019s a fair bet that should we ever hit a crisis and a big gas user (eg BlueScope) cut workers or shut down because of a lack of gas, Origin and other big energy firms might face more of those government \u201cinterventions\u201d they\u2019d rather avoid. Kate Chaney says she is cancelling her Chairman\u2019s Lounge membership West Australian independent MP Kate Chaney says she emailed Qantas today to cancel her Chairman\u2019s Lounge membership. Speaking with the ABC\u2019s Greg Jennett, she said the had \u201czero concerns from constituents\u201d about membership to the lounge, but given the media focus on the issue, membership was \u201cnot worth it if there is a perception that it is somehow influencing my decisions\u201d. \u201cI think it is a bad look to be requesting upgrades, especially if you are in charge of making policy to regulate the industry,\u201d she said. I think people really want to be able to trust politicians to make decisions in the public interest and there is a deep suspicion that politicians are getting freebies that may influence their decisions. I think it\u2019s a bad look. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s technically a breach of the code of conduct, but I suspect that from now on, politicians will think more carefully about whether they are actively soliciting upgrades and how that may be perceived. When asked whether she had been upgraded, she said she had and that the upgrade was immediately declared. Origin boss calls for redesign of national electricity market (with more gas a priority) Origin Energy boss Frank Calabria has told a lunchtime CEDA meeting in Sydney that the national electricity market is \u201cno longer driving the required investment in new generation\u201d needed by the grid. Ideally, the design of the Nem (which covers most of Australia bar WA and NT) would be drawing in enough money to support the \u201cright mix of technologies required to deliver reliable electricity supply at least cost \u2013 avoiding the need for government interventions\u201d. And to cut emissions too. We don\u2019t have to look too far to see the stresses. We\u2019re used to seeing so-called \u201clack of reserve\u201d alerts where generators are nudged to supply more electricity \u2013 and there are a couple of those out for NSW and Queensland later this week. Lately, though, we have also had the opposite \u2013 alerts for too little power demand and Victoria has another out for tomorrow. (Probably more wind and solar about rather than a lack of interest in nag races.) The wider economy, too, faces serious gas supply shortfalls (which are not only bad for big gas users, they tend to push up electricity prices too if gas-fired power plants are called on). Redesigning the Nem won\u2019t be easy but \u201cwe can choose not to pander to fringe voices and vested interests\u201d, Calabria said. Trade minister in China with representatives from 253 Australian companies The trade minister, Don Farrell, is in China, where he is doing his best to boost Australian wine sales \u2013 and to get lobster and meat sales back on track. Speaking with the ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing, he said he \u201cgot some assurances\u201d from his counterpart minister \u201cthat everything is on track to resolve\u201d the issues that have weighed on the Australian producers of those products \u2013 and that he has plans to go further: Now, having done that we are not resting on our laurels. I\u2019m here with 253 Australian companies, some of them have been here before, but many are coming for the first time and my job as the trade minister is to try and push Australian companies out of Australia and into overseas markets. Obviously China is the largest market for Australian goods. Last year we sold $327bn of two-way trade between Australia and China. But I think we can do better than that. Victoria investigates whether medicinal cannabis users can drive safely Rubber has hit the road in a world-first medicinal cannabis driving trial, as Victoria\u2019s government investigates if users can steer safely. The trial, led by Swinburne University and backed by a $4.9m state grant, aims to understand how tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) \u2013 the psychoactive compound in medicinal cannabis \u2013 impacts driving performance and risk on the road, reports AAP. The trial will test drivers\u2019 steering, braking and speed control and assess their ability to handle distractions at a Melbourne driver training centre. All participants will be accompanied by a qualified driving instructor with dual controls to take over if required. The trial was open to people prescribed cannabis for a sleep disorder, chronic pain or a mental health condition for at least six months. The study will include impairment screenings before and after test drives. Prescription cannabis has been available in Australia since 2016, and is used by more than 700,000 people to manage cancer treatment, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and other medical conditions. Victoria\u2019s upper house recently passed legislation to end automatic licence bans for medicinal users caught driving with traces of cannabis in their system. THC can be detected more than a week after it is consumed, which has landed authorised users with bans and hefty fines, despite debatable impairment at the time of driving. From March 1 2025, magistrates will have discretion to determine if the driver was impaired at the wheel. Severe heatwave forecast for parts of Queensland Temperatures into the mid-40s will scorch parts of Queensland this week, with the Bureau of Meteorology warning of severe heatwave conditions in the state\u2019s interior: The far-right provocateur Candace Owens has demanded the Australian government overturn its rejection of her visa for a planned national speaking tour. Owens has appealed to the home affairs department about the minister, Tony Burke\u2019s, decision that her presence in Australia could \u201cincite discord\u201d, warning that she will escalate to federal court litigation if it is not reversed. The US conservative influencer and podcast host has advanced conspiracy theories and been accused of antisemitic rhetoric including minimising Nazi medical experiments in concentration camps. In a statement Owens claimed to have launched a legal challenge that Burke\u2019s decision \u201cwas made with clear bias and improper motivations\u201d. \u201cAccording to Owens\u2019s legal representatives, Burke displayed prejudice against her case from the outset, making public remarks that cast doubt on his impartiality long before a decision was made,\u201d a spokesperson said. Burke also revealed private details of Owens\u2019s application to the media, further calling into question his neutrality. Guardian Australia understands that the status of the matter is now only an application to the department to have the decision revoked. A spokesperson for Owens clarified: \u201cIt is still in the appeal process \u2026 if the decision is maintained then it will be filed in federal court.\u201d \u201cThe grounds for refusal are legally unreasonable and unjustifiable,\u201d the spokesperson said. In October Burke said that \u201cAustralia\u2019s national interest is best served when Candace Owens is somewhere else\u201d. \u201cFrom downplaying the impact of the Holocaust with comments about [notorious Nazi doctor Josef] Mengele through to claims that Muslims started slavery, Candace Owens has the capacity to incite discord in almost every direction,\u201d he said. Guardian Australia contacted Burke for comment. Thank you, Tory Shepherd! Let\u2019s get straight on with the remainder of the day\u2019s news\u2026 I\u2019m handing the steering wheel over to the dazzling Daisy Dumas, as my brain is fried and frazzled from my first question time in a few moons. See you back here tomorrow! Question time ends And with a final thundering answer from the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, to a Dorothy dixer (inflation, tax cuts, surpluses, rinse and repeat), question time is done for today. Sharkie has question about veterans\u2019 graves charity The independent MP for Mayo, Rebekha Sharkie, has a question on a charity, the Headstone Project, which finds veterans in unmarked graves in South Australian cemeteries. Their application for tax deductibility status has been refused. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, says he\u2019ll \u201chave another look\u201d: We get many more applications that we can afford to fund. We do our best working closely with the minister to work out how we can impose some sort of order and priority on those, but if there has been some obvious issue here for this one then I am obviously happy to take another [look]. The opposition MP Dan Tehan raises a point of order about relevance and prompts chortles by introducing Slovakia to the debate (it\u2019s not entirely clear why, but I just wasted a couple of minutes looking at Slovakia\u2019s interest rates). The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, says the International Monetary Fund is predicting Australia\u2019s inflation will be the second highest of any economy in 2015. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, says he thinks Taylor means 2025. He goes on to say: I think it is unfortunately dishonest of the shadow treasurer to ask a question about inflation without acknowledging the very welcome and very encouraging data we got last Wednesday. The inflation we inherited at 6.1% is now 2.8%. If he wants to ask me a question about headline inflation, he shouldn\u2019t have spent the last six months saying that headline inflation doesn\u2019t matter, only underlying inflation matters. He has to make up his mind. He says inflation peaked lower and later in Australia than in other countries, and says if Taylor wants to compare Australia with other countries he should acknowledge that they have higher unemployment than we do here. Chalmers has another stab at Taylor, saying he assumes he has \u201csomeone who turns the IMF reports into little cartoons so he can understand\u201d them. Bandt asks why student debt relief cannot be introduced immediately The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, cheekily says he welcomes the government\u2019s adoption of the Greens policy on student debt, but asks why it can\u2019t be introduced immediately. \u201cI really do thank the member for Melbourne for that question,\u201d Anthony Albanese says, and accuses the Greens of working with the Coalition to hold up the government\u2019s legislation: Take, for example, our help to buy legislation \u2026 something that we took to the last election, something just like what they did with the HAFF [the Housing Australia Future Fund], they actually have motions moved in the Senate between the Greens and the Coalition, where they defer things off into the never-never. And say we can\u2019t talk about it. Albanese says Labor has committed to a range of legislation it wants to get through this year and next year, and has committed to legislation for a second term. \u201cSo we make no apologies for \u2026 saying what a re-elected Labor government will do,\u201d he says. Littleproud asks why Labor won\u2019t back divestitures for the big supermarkets The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, asks the government why it won\u2019t back the Coalition\u2019s policy on divestitures for the big supermarkets. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, says it\u2019s a \u201creally important issue\u201d. He says the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has said using those powers was \u201cunnecessary\u201d: If we get in at the start and prevent the kinds of mergers which are anti-competitive \u2026 we can get the right outcome without going towards these sorts of proposals. And one of the reasons why we should be very wary about the proposals that the leader of the Nationals has put forward today is we want to make sure there are no unintended consequences. Divestiture powers are a blunt instrument, they are rarely used in any other jurisdiction and frankly \u2026 we have better ways to crack down on anti-competitive behaviour, especially when it comes to supermarkets. PM says inflation now has a \u2018two in front of it\u2019, thanks to Labor policies The Liberal MP Jenny Ware asks the prime minister to say \u201cwithout reference to the treasurer\u201d what the cash rate is (Albanese famously stuffed up his answer to that question during the election campaign). Albanese says: We understand that interest rates have caused pressure on Australian households and, of course, interest rates, we have seen a series of increases, many of which began under the former government, to the point whereby the Reserve Bank will meet tomorrow \u2026 and the rate is of course 4.35%. Albanese says inflation now has a \u201ctwo in front of it\u201d, because of Labor\u2019s policies and budget surpluses, \u201csomething that would be unrecognisable by those opposite\u201d: One of the reasons why inflation wasn\u2019t such a problem in Australia, as the Covid inquiry confirmed, was a wasteful expenditure giving $20bn to companies that were not seeing a decrease in their revenue, some of which were seeing an increase in their revenue. Taylor brings up \u2018household recession\u2019 again The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, has brought up the \u201chousehold recession\u201d again \u2013 it\u2019s what the opposition uses in place of \u201cper capita recession\u201d. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, says if the Liberals care, they should support Labor\u2019s cost-of-living legislation: If he really cared about living standards, he wouldn\u2019t have left us [with] real wages falling very substantially \u2026 we\u2019ve now turned that around and real wages are growing again. And so if he cares about per capita circumstances and if he cares about living standards in our economy, he should be supporting our efforts to clean up the mess those opposite left behind. He says GDP per capita went backwards under the former Liberal government: We have acknowledged in a number of ways that growth in the Australian economy has been very soft. And people are doing it tough \u2026 if you care about per capita living standards in this economy, you have got two options. One option is to try to help people where you can \u2013 that\u2019s our approach \u2013 and the other option is to oppose wage increases and cost-of-living help \u2013 which is the approach of those opposite. Wilkie asks if Labor will crack down on pokie machines The independent MP Andrew Wilkie asks the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, about gambling advertising, and whether Labor would crack down on pokie machines (Albanese said in October that pokies cause the majority of gambling harm). Albanese says he doesn\u2019t question the question (after the leader of the house, Tony Burke, said it \u201coffended the standing orders\u201d). Albanese says his quote about pokie machines was \u201cjust a fact\u201d. Now Albanese is responding to a question from the deputy opposition leader, Sussan Ley: \u201cIs Australia in a household recession?\u201d There\u2019s some faffing around about the wording of the question. Albanese says the government understands that households are under pressure: It\u2019s precisely why we gave a tax cut to every Australian taxpayer. All 13.6 million of them, not just some \u2026 what was going to happen under their plan was we were all going to get a tax cut, but lower and middle-income earners were going to miss out. We wait for their policy to claw back the tax cuts they have called waste. His government \u201cprovided energy price relief for every single household\u201d, Albanese says. \u201cIn addition to that, we have provided for cheaper medicines, something those opposite also opposed and said would be a disaster. We\u2019ve introduced 60-day dispensing, literally cutting the cost in half.\u201d He adds in the fee-free Tafe spots they\u2019ve announced, cheaper childcare, etc, and says: There\u2019s not a single cost of living measure that those opposite are prepared to support. After a Dorothy dixer to the education minister, Jason Clare, on (you guessed it) the policy to reduce student debt, there\u2019s an early ejection under 94A \u2013 that\u2019s for the WA Liberal Rick Wilson. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, accuses the government of \u201creckless spending\u201d on reducing student debt. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, says his government has halved inflation, created a million jobs, and provided cost-of-living relief. For some people, their interest is more than their original debt, he says, outlining the details you can read in this story: The first thing we will do if we are re-elected is we will introduce legislation \u2026 3 million people would benefit. We\u2019re also raising their student debt repayment threshold from $54,000 to $67,000 and lowering the repayment rate. You will save $1,300 if you\u2019re earning $65,000 a year. In addition to that, we are also making free Tafe permanent. He says that will allow more tradies to build homes, more apprentices to get a start and more carers for loved ones: We understand that education is the key to opening those doors of opportunity and we want to widen it. That is what this government is about and I\u2019m proud of the announcements that we have made over the last few days. And over the coming days or weeks and months, there will be more about what our second term agenda looks like. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, also offers his condolences, and now question time is under way. Hold on to your hats! Albanese pays tribute to \u2018trailblazer\u2019 Fay Marles Just ahead of question time, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is giving his condolences on the death of the defence minister Richard Marles\u2019 mother, Fay Marles. She was a \u201ctrailblazer\u201d, he says: She made a real difference and a lasting difference for women in particular but ultimately for the nation. Fay was appointed Victoria\u2019s first equal opportunity commissioner following the introduction of the Equal Opportunity Act. She was the first woman to become deputy chancellor of Melbourne University in 1996. She was the first woman to become chancellor of Melbourne University in 2001. And she was made a member of the Order of Australia in 1986. Throughout her 98 years, Fay led a life that was full and complete and was about compassion for others and making a difference. ABC\u2019s David Anderson unable to attend Senate estimates The outgoing ABC managing director, David Anderson, is unable to attend Senate estimates tomorrow due to a medical issue, the ABC chair, Kim Williams, has told the communications committee. Anderson resigned in August, a year into his second term after a 35-year career at the ABC, and will remain in the role until the new year. The acting managing director and chief financial officer, Melanie Kleyn, chief people officer, Deena Amorelli, director of news, Justin Stevens, and editorial director, Gavin Fang, will appear before the committee to answer questions. Williams notified the chair of the environment and communications committee, Senator Karen Grogan, last week that Anderson had taken leave to attend to medical issues. A spokesperson said: This is only the second time in more than six years as managing director that Mr Anderson has been unable to attend an estimates hearing. The ABC takes the accountability mechanism provided by Senate estimates with great seriousness. Anderson is due to return to work on 9 December. Emma Shortis has written about how \u201csome of the worst excesses of far-right American politics, led by Trump\u201d have some sway here in Australia: A second Trump presidency would pose a considerable challenge to our shared democratic values. Are we up to that challenge? DPS chief says it has no written record of former head\u2019s conflict-of-interest declaration The acting secretary of the Department of Parliamentary Services (DPS), Jaala Hinchcliffe, has acknowledged the department has no written record that the secretary, Rob Stefanic, declared a conflict of interest within the department, despite him reporting having done so to the speaker of the House of Representatives as well as externally to the Australian Public Service commissioner. The shadow finance minister, Jane Hume, told Monday\u2019s hearing of the finance and public administration estimates committee that she intended to write to the attorney general to seek a review of DPS\u2019s governance practices after evidence that no written record existed of the alleged declaration to the speaker, Milton Dick, exists. Hume has been asking questions about Stefanic allegedly having declared a personal relationship with his then deputy, Cate Saunders. At estimates hearings in May, Stefanic \u2013 who is now on indefinite leave \u2013 denied any romantic relationship with Saunders and said he only declared a personal relationship because of \u201cgossip\u201d and \u201crumour\u201d. Hume told Hinchcliffe she was concerned at the department\u2019s practices: So we\u2019ve got no record of the declarations for this contact, we\u2019ve only got recollections. We\u2019ve got inconsistent stories about who knew what and when. We have an inconsistent and at best patchy record of when the department was told about a secondment for the deputy secretary and in fact it may have had more of a role in arranging it than anyone was aware but we won\u2019t know because it appears that nothing has been written down. We\u2019ve had to take a lot of this on trust because the department is not subject to freedom of information. The only public scrutiny of this department is here. Two ministers and the presiding officers potentially have been misled, given they only found out about the conflict months after the APSC was allegedly told. Do you think it\u2019s acceptable for people outside of this building who pay taxes to provide for this department that the record-keeping is so inadequate? Hinchcliffe replied to Hume: Senator, I would say that in my career as a public servant I have constantly thought about the fact that every single dollar that I spend is taxpayers\u2019 money and the public trust that they put into me to undertake my work with integrity and with efficiency and effectiveness is incredibly important. That, I think, stands for all of us as public servants and part of how we do that is that we do our jobs well and we do them properly and that includes proper record-keeping. Hinchcliffe said her experience, including working in oversight agencies, was that record-keeping was often a problem. It seems to be something that the public service find difficult to get right. It will be an area of focus for us at DPS. Hinchcliffe has confirmed that DPS has commissioned an independent \u201cfact-finding\u201d exercise into the $300,000 payout that Saunders received when she left the department. Damaging storms possible in NSW A quick look at today\u2019s weather warnings from the Bureau of Meteorology. Severe thunderstorms are forecast in the east and north of New South Wales, where residents have been warned of damaging wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain: To the north, in parts of central and western Queensland, temperatures are above the seasonal average, with the bureau warning of heatwave conditions in Longreach. Allegra Spender, the independent member for Wentworth, wants an end to free airline upgrades and says she has cancelled her Qantas and Virgin VIP lounge memberships. The Sydney Morning Herald is reporting that independent MP Helen Haines has \u201cstarted the process\u201d to quit the Chairman\u2019s Lounge. Karen Middleton wrote earlier about a testy exchange between Greens senator David Shoebridge and home affairs department secretary Stephanie Foster. Enjoy the full vision here: Federal police may search PwC Australia headquarters for \u2018several days\u2019 \u2013 CEO PwC Australia\u2019s chief executive, Kevin Burrowes, has told staff the Australian federal police may be searching the firm\u2019s Sydney office for \u201cseveral days\u201d. As mentioned earlier, the search relates to an ongoing investigation into alleged misconduct by former staff, after confidential Treasury information was shared in breach of disclosure laws. Here\u2019s part of an email Burrowes sent to staff earlier today: I am writing to advise the Australian federal police is attending our Sydney office today and may be on the premises for several days. This step is an expected development in relation to an investigation the AFP commenced in 2023 into the historical tax matter and individuals who have left our firm. We have been working with the AFP to facilitate its attendance and will continue to cooperate with its investigation. Please carry on as usual and remain focused on the important work we\u2019re delivering with our clients and in the community. The Australian federal police are conducting a search at PwC Australia\u2019s headquarters in Sydney. The search for documents relates to an ongoing investigation into alleged misconduct by former PwC Australia staff, after confidential Treasury information was shared in breach of disclosure laws. A source familiar with the police search stressed it did not relate to current PwC Australia staff. Here\u2019s the statement from PwC Australia: This step is part of the existing investigation that began in 2023 regarding the historical tax matter, and is an investigation into individuals who have left the firm. We have been working with the Australian federal police (AFP) to facilitate their attendance and will continue to fully cooperate with their investigation, as we have from the beginning. In the past 18 months, PwC has introduced significant governance, business and cultural reforms, and our people remain focused on delivering the best outcomes for our clients and communities. The federal treasury referred the PwC tax scandal to the Australian federal police for a criminal investigation in May. The AFP has been contacted for comment. Student union says Labor\u2019s Hecs relief plan a \u2018disingenuous\u2019 bid for votes Oh dear. University students are unhappy with the federal government\u2019s plans to reduce student debt. AAP reports that the National Union of Students (Nus) has described it as \u201cdisingenuous\u201d. President Ngaire Bogemann said it was little more than an attempt to win votes and would not address concerns held by students. She told ABC Radio: If you want to talk about creating a fairer and more accessible higher education system, wiping debts to 20% is not actually getting to the root cause of the issue. The root cause was indexation, which kept debts growing, Bogemann said. This seems a bit of a disingenuous attempt to bring some people in, vote-wise, and not an attempt to actually create change. Bogemann said Hecs indexation levels would result in many students back where they started in terms of their debt levels, even after the 20% reduction. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen young Australians denied home loans because the Hecs debts are so large,\u201d she said. There are a whole heap of other issues here that I think are probably going to create more of an impact if they change. The federal government moved earlier in 2024 to cap indexation on Hecs at either the rate of inflation or the wage price index, whichever of the two is lower, after the indexation rate increased rapidly above 7%. Loneliness levels no different when working from home at times, forum told The mandate to get workers back to the office is not justified to improve loneliness, a conference dedicated to the subject has heard. Ending Loneliness Together\u2019s research and policy symposium held in partnership with the University of Sydney\u2019s prevention research collaboration unit and Wallis Social Research is being held in Sydney today. Associate Prof Sarah Wright, from University of Canterbury business school, discussed her study published in the December issue of the Harvard Business Review which looked at 1,000 knowledge workers employed by companies in the United States in more than 20 industries, including financial services, healthcare, technology and manufacturing. Wright said fully remote employees are lonelier but they found there was no difference between those working hybrid and those working five days in person when it comes to level of loneliness. In fact, they found highly lonely participants reported conducting nearly half (47%) of their prior month\u2019s work interactions in person, which shows that even a substantial amount of face-to-face work does not automatically translate into less loneliness. Wright told the conference: The mandate to pull people back to the office is not justified to improve loneliness. Heath minister eyes private sector changes Butler says he has asked the health department to look at the private health sector and potential short-, medium- and long-term reforms. I don\u2019t have a view about what they may look like into the future. I just want to encourage all different parts of this sector, which sometimes have competing interests, to continue the very cooperative way in which they undertook the process over the last few months. On the Covid inquiry, Butler says it will take a \u201cdetermined effort on the part of all governments\u201d and stakeholders to rebuild trust, including through measures such as establishing a national centre for disease control. He says: As much people don\u2019t want to go back and don\u2019t want to think about what was such a painful period for our community, I thought there was a really constructive community debate about some of the things that happened and some of the things that we could do better. Butler doesn\u2019t understand Coalition\u2019s \u2018violent objection\u2019 to easing student debt On the government\u2019s moves on education debt, Butler says it\u2019s an attempt to ease pressure on students. He says: They\u2019re saddled with these record levels of debt at a time of real financial pressure on them, whether it\u2019s rental costs or having to save up for a house deposit. It\u2019s a personal and a national investment, the health minister says. \u201cWe make no apology for doing everything we can to relieve that financial pressure. I just don\u2019t understand why there\u2019s been such a violent objection to it from the opposition. Asked about election timing, he suggests the gathered journalists could \u201call read tea leaves about election timing\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m sure that will happen for the coming joyous weeks and months as we lead into the next election,\u201d he says. Butler says there has been an increase in bulk billing in every jurisdiction but that it has been \u201cparticularly pronounced\u201d in rural and regional Australia. \u201cOf course there is more to do,\u201d he says. But just in 12 months \u2026 we have delivered 5.4m additional free visits to the GP. That\u2019s making a real difference. That\u2019s \u2026 in addition to 850,000 patients that have gone through our urgent care clinics. He points to past increases to Medicare rebates but says they\u2019ll do more. Bulk billing has \u201cstopped sliding\u201d, health minister Mark Butler says. He\u2019s on the ABC now talking about this story: DPS probes $300,000 payout to ex-official after conflict of interest declared The Department of Parliamentary Services (DPS) is conducting an independent \u201cfact-finding\u201d mission into the department\u2019s role in a $300,000 payout to a former deputy secretary after a conflict of interest was revealed. At the last Senate estimates in May, the DPS boss, Rob Stefanic, who is on indefinite paid leave, denied having a romantic relationship with his then subordinate, Cate Saunders, telling Senate estimates he formally declared a conflict of interest only due to \u201cgossip\u201d and \u201crumour\u201d. Months after the conflict of interest was declared, Saunders was placed on secondment at Services Australia in April 2023 until she accepted a $315,126 incentive payment for her retirement from the public service on 1 October 2023. The exit package was approved by the Department of Parliamentary Services. Stefanic told the hearing he was not personally involved in its sign-off. In her opening statement on Monday, the acting secretary, Jaala Hinchcliffe, revealed she had engaged Dr Fiona Roughly SC to investigate whether the department followed \u201ccorrect processes\u201d in the decision. Hinchcliffe said she was \u201cunable to provide further comment on this matter but will update the committee at the appropriate time\u201d. Sparks fly between senator and official over home affairs\u2019 survey ranking Greens senator David Shoebridge has had a testy exchange with home affairs department secretary Stephanie Foster in the legal and constitutional affairs estimates committee hearing over the public service staff survey that ranked home affairs among the lowest in all cohorts across the Australian public service. Shoebridge demanded to know if one of the departmental officials had a copy of the 2024 staff census and could table it but Foster blocked her from answering, drawing an angry response from Shoebridge, who noted that home affairs was in the bottom 10% of every rating measure. Foster defended her achievements. She said: We\u2019ve made some progress in some of the key metrics that matter most, about staff engagement, about SES [senior executive service] communication. We clearly have significant work still to do, and that\u2019s not surprising to me, in the context of a very large agency operating in a very complex environment. Shoebridge also highlighted the findings on staff being less willing to report incidences of inappropriate behaviour. Foster insisted that the survey showed an increase in reporting of bullying and harassment and noted that, anecdotally, people were happy emailing her to raise concerns. After a short break in proceedings, Shoebridge produced the survey and tabled it himself. \u201cUnder your leadership, secretary, people feel much less confident to speak up and raise concerns about inappropriate behaviour than they did before you became secretary - and the previous secretary was not a shrinking violet,\u201d Shoebridge said, referring to former secretary Mike Pezzullo. \u201cHow do you explain that?\u201d Foster insisted confidence was increasing. Shadow home affairs minister James Paterson chimed in, ahead of changing the subject. \u201cPerhaps the new informal headshots will fix this problem and staff will be willing to come forward,\u201d Paterson said, moving on. \u201cWhen shown details and given a choice between nuclear and other forms of energy, nuclear fares very, very badly, climate change and energy minister Chris Bowen told Adam Morton: And if too much Bowen is barely enough, here\u2019s another great piece from Morton that ran on the weekend: The secretary of the transport department has defended his and other top bureaucrats\u2019 membership to Qantas\u2019 exclusive Chairman\u2019s lounges that includes access for their partners, insisting he and such colleagues don\u2019t make regulatory decisions affecting airlines. The admission from Jim Betts, the secretary of the Department of Infrastructure and Transport, comes amid ongoing debate about the influence of Qantas on decision-making in Canberra, and recent scrutiny about flight upgrades prime minister Anthony Albanese received when he was transport minister. Betts told a Senate estimates hearing on Monday morning that he had membership to Qantas Chairman\u2019s lounges across the country, as did his wife. He said all deputy secretaries of his department also had the membership, and \u201cin a couple of cases\u201d their partners did too. He also said he only had access to Virgin Australia\u2019s standard lounges, not its Beyond lounges, which aim to rival Qantas\u2019 Chairman\u2019s lounges. Betts said he didn\u2019t didn\u2019t believe the memberships to the elite lounges created a perception of influence over the department, noting that regulatory decisions about airlines weren\u2019t taken at his secretary level, and that his predecessors in the role had also had access. Nationals senator Matt Canavan then asked Betts about an email \u2013 released under freedom of information \u2013 sent by an assistant to a newly appointed deputy secretary in the transport department, David McKay. The email, sent to a Qantas employee in 2023, is notifying Qantas that McKay should now be entitled to be upgraded to the invitation-only Chairman\u2019s Lounge membership. Betts, who was asked if such a request amounted to solicitation of a gift, said that while he hadn\u2019t seen the email, \u201cit\u2019s standard practice\u201d for deputy secretaries to have the membership. The acting secretary of the Department of Parliamentary Services (DPS) , Jaala Hinchcliffe, has confirmed the National Anti-Corruption Commission (Nacc) executed warrants on the parliamentary department last month, as first revealed by Guardian Australia. In her opening statement, Hinchcliffe said the Nacc officials visited Parliament House in October but would not reveal further information regarding their purpose or staff involved. Hinchcliffe also confirmed in her opening statement that the secretary, Rob Stefanic, was on paid leave but did not yet have a return date. Guardian Australia reported the long-serving secretary went on a sudden period of leave announced in a department-wide email last month. Stefanic was appointed as the department\u2019s secretary in December 2015. He was reappointed for a second term in December 2020 for another five years to 13 December 2025. AAP reports that Anthony Albanese has denied his staff requested flight upgrades from Qantas on his behalf. The prime minister has been criticised after it emerged he received 22 flight upgrades - some when he was transport minister. He denied allegations he contacted former Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce to make a request, and said any upgrades given were all declared. Asked if anyone in his office had inquired about an upgrade on his behalf, Albanese told the ABC: \u201cNot to my knowledge.\u201d Everything has been declared, and I\u2019ve had no upgrades as prime minister. As the federal election looms in the first half of 2025, the controversy continues to plague the government, which has been accused by the opposition of being out of touch. Albanese has also come under fire after it was revealed he bought a clifftop home for $4.3m. Independent senator Jacqui Lambie said Australians were focused on making ends meet during a cost-of-living crisis, and denied ever asking for a flight upgrade. \u201cIt really blows me away, and I think most people have had a gut full of it,\u201d she told the ABC. The reputation of politicians gets worse every year, and we are to blame up here. Nobody else is to blame but the people here in the higher office. Shadow home affairs minister James Paterson has been grilling home affairs department secretary Stephanie Foster in the legal and constitutional affairs estimates hearing over why the department has removed the Australian, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags from the background of headshot photographs of the department\u2019s executive on its website. Paterson said he had noticed that the photographs now had no flags in the background and that they appeared to have been Photoshopped out. Foster said it was her doing and that she \u201cwanted to have photos that were less formal\u201d. She said: I think having photographs against a background of flags gives a certain formality to the photo. As you know, as part of our cultural reform, I\u2019ve been working hard to make sure that the senior executive are very accessible to staff. It was one small change that I thought might assist with that program. Paterson wanted to know who undertook the task of removing the flags from the photos \u2013 he was told it was the media and communications staff \u2013 and how much work it took. He said: In July and August, the department was dealing with some pretty big issues and continues to deal with some big issues, whether it\u2019s the released cohort of non-citizen offenders, or whether it was Palestinian visas or folks getting through to the Australian mainland. Was this really a high priority for the department at a time like that? Foster responded: Senator, in terms of executive focus it took very little time. And whilst I\u2019ll have to take on notice how big what the executive did was, I\u2019m struggling to believe it was much work. Department clerk gives estimates some guidance on Lidia Thorpe\u2019s oath It\u2019s Senate estimates week but it isn\u2019t always about hard news during the 13-hour grilling of public officials. This morning, the Department of the Senate, a little known department that helps keep the upper chamber\u2019s engine running, is up and the clerk is being asked about whether Senator Lidia Thorpe\u2019s oath is legitimate. As a reminder, because news moves fast, Thorpe told ABC she had sworn allegiance to Queen Elizabeth\u2019s \u201chairs\u201d, instead of \u201cheirs\u201d, but later said it was an accidental mispronunciation. The opposition has written to the Senate president to review her legitimacy as a senator. The shadow foreign affairs minister, Simon Birmingham, is quizzing the department about whether a senator should continue to serve given the oath\u2019s mispronunciation. The clerk, Richard Pye, who\u2019s sporting a shiny earring that has absolutely caught my eye, said the idea they should be disqualified on that basis \u201ctakes the point a bit too far\u201d. He said there had been a number of examples in the UK where MPs had said the oath with their fingers crossed, or later said their allegiance was to the people they serve and not the monarch. \u201cYou\u2019re a senator unless \u2013 and until you \u2013 resign your place, find yourself disqualified \u2013 as people have \u2013 or the good people of your state or territory say otherwise,\u201d Pye said. He also suggested there was a \u201cnon zero chance\u201d Thorpe was \u201ctrolling the media\u201d when she made the hairs/heirs comment, although he said it was \u201can opinion I shouldn\u2019t be expressing\u201d. It\u2019s Monday morning and I\u2019m still bright-eyed. Let\u2019s see how I fare after a few more hours of this.

The acting attorney general, Enver Erdogan, has today announced the supreme court\u2019s probate fees will move from a fixed rate to a tiered system for the first time. Under the change, estates worth less than $250,000 won\u2019t have to pay probate fees. But all others will be slugged between 0.21-0.24% of the estate\u2019s total value. Erdogan said: Our probate fees are currently considerably lower than other states and don\u2019t cover the costs of hearings in the supreme court adequately. It\u2019s why we\u2019re making the system fairer by abolishing probate fees for small estates and keeping medium-sized estate fees cheaper than New South Wales and South Australia\u2019s fees. For the very small percentage of Victorians dealing with multimillion-dollar estates, the fees will be lifted to cover the level of administration and dispute resolution these complex applications often require in court. The government is yet to provide a breakdown of the new fee structure. But it\u2019s a huge jump, particularly for those with multimillion-dollar estimates. The family of a deceased loved one with estate worth $2m, for example, will go from paying a fixed rate of $1,502.40 to $4,800 \u2013 an increase of 219%. The Law Institute of Victoria had previously urged the government not to go ahead with increases. They\u2019ve been approached for comment. Nuclear plant idea for NSW region with seismic activity prompts questions WA Labor senator Varun Ghosh has been probing whether National Emergency Management Agency (Nema) has detected concerns about, or been asked to investigate, suggestions that a nuclear power plant could be built in the Muswellbrook region of New South Wales, which he noted had recorded some seismic activity. \u201cCan I just ask from a disaster preparation or management perspective, have you given any consideration to what the impact of putting a nuclear facility in an area that has that sort of seismic activity would be?\u201d Ghosh asked during Monday morning\u2019s legal and constitutional affairs estimates committee hearing, without referring specifically to the Coalition\u2019s nuclear energy policy. Nema\u2019s deputy coordinator general Joe Buffone said the answer was \u201cno\u201d: We haven\u2019t been engaged and we haven\u2019t been asked to undertake any advice in relation to that. Ghosh pressed on, asking if Nema would expect to be. Buffone said historically the agency hadn\u2019t been asked to provide advice on such matters but if asked, it would consider it. Ghosh tried one more time, asking if any community groups had raised issues with Nema around having a nuclear facility built nearby. \u201cNot at this point, senator,\u201d Buffone replied. AAP reports that newly installed Queensland premier David Crisafulli has been talking about a controversial pumped hydro project that has been scrapped after a major cost blowout. Crisafulli went to the October state election promising to cut Labor\u2019s Pioneer Burdekin project in central Queensland, claiming it was the source of a budget black hole. The LNP then received a briefing within 48 hours of taking office that the project\u2019s $12bn cost had ballooned to $36.77bn \u2013 more than triple what was originally forecast. Crisafulli told ABC Radio: I find it completely and utterly implausible that the former government wouldn\u2019t have known about that. Before the election, then premier Steven Miles admitted the price tag would be high for the project \u2013 heralded as the centrepiece of the Labor\u2019s renewables plan \u2013 but would be worthwhile in the long term. \u201c[Pumped hydro projects] are income-generating assets that will generate a return to Queenslanders, basically forever,\u201d he said during his second election debate with Crisafulli. The capital cost, you\u2019re right, is high, but the operational cost is very, very low, and the revenue from them is very, very high. Crisafulli visited the town of Eungella on Sunday to meet landholders whose properties were resumed or forcibly sold off for the project. The premier apologised to those Queenslanders who he claimed the former government failed to consult before committing to the project. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve been through was horrendous,\u201d he said. Deputy premier Jarrod Bleijie promised on Friday to write to the almost 60 affected landowners and \u201cwork out a way forward\u201d. The LNP government will look to build multiple, smaller pumped hydro plants at yet-to-be-decided locations without a forecast price tag. Crisafulli said: We have to find a way to deliver smaller, more manageable pumped hydro because it\u2019s important if you\u2019re going to firm up renewables, you need that. He promised to deliver the Borumba pumped hydro project, near the Sunshine Coast, at an affordable cost. The former government budgeted $6bn towards the project, with the total cost estimated to be $14bn. Once the government decides on its list of smaller pumped hydro projects, it will unveil its plan. Environmental advocates have called on the government to release details about its Pioneer Burdekin alternatives within 100 days. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that the new state government is upfront about which pumped hydro projects they\u2019re considering,\u201d Queensland Conservation Council director Dave Copeman said. Queenslanders want to know they\u2019re serious about getting on with the energy transition, but also, critically, we need to be able to assess the potential environmental impacts of their plans. The LNP government will hold its first cabinet meeting on Monday after ministers were sworn in on Friday. Shadow finance minister Jane Hume told Sky News this morning that \u201cpersistent, sticky\u201d inflation was to blame for higher student debts. She said the government\u2019s plan was \u201can economically irresponsible and inequitable decision\u201d: It favours those university students that have higher incomes in the longer term \u2026 about 30% higher than those that haven\u2019t gone to university. But it\u2019s those that haven\u2019t gone to university or those that have already paid off their debts that will pay the price through higher taxes. Disaster resilience funding used for fitting thermal curtains in ACT homes, estimates hears In the legal and constitutional affairs estimates committee, deputy Nationals leader Perin Davey has questioned national disaster resilience funding being used to top up an ACT government program to fit thermal curtains in the homes of vulnerable people in the national capital at a cost of $3,000 per household. National Emergency Management Agency official Dr Jill Charker explained that the ACT suffered significantly from heatwaves and that the program was deemed meritorious in helping to protect people. Davey raised the prospect of other jurisdictions wanting the same financial support: I\u2019m just concerned if we have a repeat from every other state government - because heatwaves are a risk all over Australia... I think when looking at these things, we\u2019ve also got to look at the precedent being set. At a cost of $3,000 per household, Davey said she hoped \u201cpeople were getting a reduction in their insurance premiums\u201d . This post was amended on 4 November to correct the names of Dr Jill Charker and the National Emergency Management Agency Delays in flood-damaged home buybacks queried The legal and constitutional affairs estimates committee has kicked off with the National Emergency Management Agency (Nema) giving an update on the NSW northern rivers\u2019 flood recovery and the home buyback program through the NSW Reconstruction Authority. Deputy Nationals leader Perin Davey is asking about progress in buying back and demolishing flood-damaged homes. The deputy coordinator general of resilience and recovery at Nema, Dr Jill Charker, tells the hearing that 1,003 homes have been approved for buybacks, 825 offers for buybacks have been approved and 699 have been accepted. Davey is asking why the program is taking so long. Charker explains that flood mapping and then subsequent consultations can require extensions of time. Great work here from political reporter Sarah Basford Canales on wild increases in gambling company donations: PM says Hecs wasn\u2019t meant to be \u2018a lifetime of debt\u2019 Anthony Albanese says slashing university students\u2019 debt will contribute back to education, with 80% of children currently in primary school set to need a uni or Tafe qualification to get a job. \u201cThe Hecs scheme was never meant to be a lifetime of debt,\u201d the prime minister told ABC radio. For many people, the interest that they are paying on that debt is more than the original Hecs payment. One of the things about university degrees, as well as Tafe qualifications, is that it doesn\u2019t just help the individual student. It\u2019s the key to our national economy. AAP has a roundup of the week ahead in Canberra: Federal Labor is banking on education reform to give it a much-needed boost, as MPs and senators return to Canberra for the final month of parliamentary sittings. But a furore over flight upgrades and the outcome of the US election threatens to overshadow any plans the government has for a pre-election reset. The upcoming sitting week in Parliament House is set to be dominated by education after Labor announced it would slash HECS debts for university students by 20%, if it is returned at the next election. The government is also hoping an emphasis on fee-free Tafe will give it a boost, after announcing there will be 100,000 places made available each year from 2027. On Sunday, prime minister Anthony Albanese said: More tradies to build our homes, more apprentices getting a start, more carers to look after our loved ones, whether they be young or old, more opportunities for Australians to train and retrain. The House of Representatives is also expected to pass laws supporting a 15% pay rise for early childcare workers, ahead of the boost coming into effect in December. But the Coalition is likely to continue to press the government on the prime minister\u2019s travel arrangements, amid revelations he received 22 flight upgrades from Qantas, with some reportedly granted after Albanese contacted the airline\u2019s former head, Alan Joyce. Albanese has denied he had contacted Joyce for flight upgrades. Education minister Jason Clare on Sunday admitted he also sought a flight upgrade in 2019 after surgery on his leg. He called Qantas to ask for the upgrade. With the upcoming sitting week also featuring a round of Senate estimates hearings on government spending and decision-making, questions about MPs travel arrangements are expected to feature prominently. While the debate in Parliament House is expected to be fiery, all eyes in Canberra on Wednesday will be trained on the US as the results from the presidential race between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump feed through. Both sides of politics have stressed Australia\u2019s relationship with the US will remain unchanged, regardless of who wins. Economic management in Australia will also be high on the agenda, with the Reserve Bank of Australia set to hand down its decision on interest rates on Tuesday. The cash interest rate has been on hold at 4.35% since November 2023, while the government has been buoyed by key inflation figures showing price pressures fell to 2.8% in the September quarter. It\u2019s the first time inflation has been within the central bank\u2019s preferred 2% and 3% target range since 2021. The lower house is also set to debate laws that would bar the NBN from being sold off, along with aged care and merger reform. Home affairs minister Tony Burke said misinformation laws would also be back up for debate: Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our democracy, society and economy. As usual, the opposition will come to parliament to try and stand in the way of Labor reforms that are delivering for Australians. The federal election will be held by the end of May. In case you missed it \u2013 political editor Karen Middleton talked to shadow transport minister Bridget McKenzie about the Qantas saga for the Australian Politics podcast \u2013 please enjoy McKenzie\u2019s nimble wordcraft: Westpac has recorded a $7bn full-year profit, representing a modest decline on last year\u2019s strong result, as the number of homeowners falling behind on repayments jumped higher. The major bank blamed \u201celevated interest rates and cost-of-living pressures\u201d for a 24 basis point increase in 90-day mortgage delinquencies for the 12 months to the end of September, which refers to loans with repayments that have fallen behind by more than three months. Westpac\u2019s hardship provisions also rose sharply as the lender allowed under-pressure customers to restructure their loans. Westpac chief executive Peter King said that while the majority of clients were showing resilience, \u201cwe recognise some customers are facing difficult choices\u201d. The bank also warned of a \u201cless favourable outlook for commercial property\u201d. Analysts have noted that any future shock to the banking system would likely stem from their exposure to commercial properties, where there are some concerns over falling office tower valuations and constrained retail spending. Westpac declared a final dividend of 76 cents, up from 72c a year ago. Its $7bn annual net profit was down 3% from last year\u2019s $7.2bn result. Andrew Giles says boosting construction skills an \u2018absolute priority\u2019 The Australia Institute reported last week on the surge in the cost of university \u2013 including the expense of arts degrees. Giles says it\u2019s a real issue the government has to confront, and that these measures on student debt will be part of that response. He says the government is particularly targeting construction skills: This is an absolute priority \u2026 building a workforce that will enable us, amongst other things, to build the houses Australians need. Aaaaaaand back to Qantas upgrades and lounge access ... Giles says voters are more focused on what the government is doing for them than what they are doing for themselves. What we do need to do though is support trust in politics and the system of declarations is obviously fundamentally important in that. Skills and training minister Andrew Giles is up on ABC radio now talking about the student debt plan. He says students are doing it tough: This is going to continue to incentivise people to do something which is good for them \u2013 getting a good education \u2013 but also good for the country. They will contribute the economy and pay tax, he says, when asked about the impact on the budget bottom line. Some more on that bulk-billing guff that health minister Mark Butler was talking about earlier \u2013 here\u2019s a wrap from chief political correspondent Paul Karp: Fletcher said it was a matter for the finance department to enforce politicians choosing the cheapest airfares. (On the weekend, the Nine newspapers reported that Virgin had complained that the vast majority of MPs and staffers\u2019 flights were on Qantas.) He told ABC radio the Coalition stood up for competition in aviation, that in government they focused on building western Sydney airport, and questioned why the Labor government had not opened up the aviation sector to Qatar in 2022. Here\u2019s a good wrap of what happened at the time, if you\u2019ve not been glued to the saga since then: Student debt relief an \u2018unfair\u2019 burden on taxpayers, Liberal MP says Coalition frontbencher Paul Fletcher has been on ABC\u2019s Radio National saying it\u2019s a \u201cprofoundly unfair policy\u201d because taxpayers will bear the cost. What this will simply do is increase the burden on all taxpayers ... this has to be paid for. There\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. Asked about generational inequality, Fletcher talked about inflation getting \u201cout of control\u201d and driving up those student debts. He said the government had \u201cgiven up\u201d on tackling inflation and the cost of living. But host Steve Cannane didn\u2019t let him get away with that answer, and brought it back to generational inequality. Fletcher said \u201cof course there are issues\u201d with concerning the needs of young Australians, including housing. Fletcher said young people would benefit from the Coalition\u2019s housing policies. But he wouldn\u2019t say whether the opposition would reverse those changes to student debt if they went through parliament. Bulk billing turning a corner \u2013 Butler And naturally Butler was also asked about the upgrades saga. He said MPs had complied with the rules, and said the stories had \u201coccupied a lot of column inches, a lot of radio and TV time\u201d but that they were just getting on with the job. He also foreshadowed an announcement on bulk billing, saying they were starting to \u201cturn a corner\u201d. We\u2019re seeing more doctors, we\u2019re seeing more bulk billing, and we\u2019re seeing more Medicare urgent-care clinics. Butler defends student debt relief Health minister Mark Butler has been asked on ABC television whether it\u2019s \u201cfair\u201d that taxpayers foot the burden for students\u2019 debt relief. He said students were under \u201creal financial pressure\u201d: It\u2019s something we can afford as a country because we know there\u2019s no better investment we can make than in the skills and the education of our young citizens. Well hello, Australia, and welcome to the third-last sitting week of the parliamentary year. I just learned that the word for that is \u201cantepenultimate\u201d. Prime minister Anthony Albanese joined South Australian premier Peter Malinauskas yesterday to kick off what some are referring to as the election campaign. When we\u2019re all distracted by the shenanigans in the United States! The centrepiece was an announcement on student debt relief to the tune of $16bn and fee-free Tafe places and the obligatory three-word slogan (in this case, \u201cBuilding Australia\u2019s Future\u201d). The Coalition has been out already this morning saying they probably can\u2019t afford to match that pitch to younger Australians. Nationals leader David Littleproud told ABC television this morning that they would \u201cstruggle\u201d to find the dosh. He said: We\u2019re going through a process now, but I just can\u2019t see how we can pick winners to that scale of money and support a mechanism like this. In the totality of this cost-of-living crisis, there are more pressing things about getting your energy bill down, and we can do that quickly with more gas and a long-term policy around energy. We\u2019ll hear more about that today, but there\u2019s little chance it\u2019ll knock conversations about Qantas flight upgrades and the Chairman\u2019s Lounge off the agenda.",

      "bodyText": "Fraudsters may have stolen \u00a3500,000 from a taxpayer-funded scheme aimed at accelerating the removal of dangerous cladding from buildings, the public spending watchdog has revealed. The National Audit Office said the government decision to prioritise speed in handing out money to building owners had increased its risk of losses from fraud. The warning came in an NAO report into the government\u2019s progress in remediating dangerous cladding from blocks after the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017. It found that as many as 60% of buildings across the country with dangerous cladding have yet to be identified, while of the 4,771 buildings that had been identified, work had started on only half of them. The \u00a34.5bn Building Safety Fund was launched in 2020 to protect leaseholders in England from the costs of cladding removal after the Grenfell Tower tragedy after tens of thousands received bills, in some cases as high as \u00a3100,000. However, the NAO report revealed that last autumn the fund was subject to a potential fraud in which \u00a3500,000 was paid to an unnamed suspected scammer using a mechanism in which 80% of the funding for a scheme could be paid upfront. After the potential fraud was identified, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) commissioned an independent review of the case, which found a number of problems with its processes. These included a reliance on self-certification, which limited the ministry\u2019s ability to verify details, the report also stating that the 80% advance payment structure \u201cincreased the opportunity and motivation for fraud\u201d. The report said the fund carried an inherent risk of misrepresentation and collusion in \u201can industry with known historical integrity issues\u201d, while also finding that there had not been a fraud measurement programme linked to the scheme. A later review of the scheme\u2019s fraud management found that the controls were \u201cnot commensurate with the programme\u2019s risk\u201d. The NAO\u2019s comments have echoes of its findings about the government\u2019s emergency Covid lending scheme, which the watchdog found had prioritised speed over fraud prevention. The NAO report estimated that the total cost of fixing all of the country\u2019s buildings with dangerous cladding could hit \u00a316.6bn, with \u00a39.1bn of that coming from the taxpayer and the rest funded by developers, private owners and social housing providers. The NAO believes the industry is not on course to hit a government target of remediation of all blocks over 11 metres tall by 2035 and dangerous cladding could remain on blocks well after that. This means that dangerous cladding could still be on buildings more than 20 years after the Grenfell Tower fire. The NAO said the government should consider tougher enforcement activity to help resolve or avoid protracted disputes over scope of works if the speed of the programme has not increased by the end of the year. It has also called for MHCLG to look into conducting an exercise to estimate the extent of undetected fraud and error across the cladding works, to help it understand the scale of the problem and where to carry out further investigations. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said: \u201cThe programme is falling behind schedule and MHCLG needs to pick up the pace to get it back on track. There is a long road ahead to resolve the cladding crisis and the government must take steps to better protect the taxpayer. It urgently needs to ensure its fraud controls are working and that developers contribute their fair share to the costs.\u201d The building safety minister, Alex Norris, said: \u201cThe pace of remediation to make homes safe has been unacceptably slow.

      "bodyText": "Drax will keep raising the levels of carbon emissions in the atmosphere until the 2050s despite using carbon capture technology, according to scientific research. The large power plant in North Yorkshire is a significant generator of electricity for the UK but has faced repeated criticism of its business model of burning wood pellets sourced from forests in the US and Canada. The new study found that the intensive forest management needed to source 7m tonnes of wood pellets from forests in the US to burn as fuel every year would erode the carbon stored in the ecosystems of these pine forests for at least 25 years. Drax was once one of the largest coal power plants in Europe but its owners claim that its switch to burning wood pellets means it is now a source of \u201ccarbon-neutral\u201d electricity because the emissions produced from its chimney stacks are offset by the emissions absorbed by the trees grown to produce the pellets. The research was based on a 2021 peer-reviewed analysis of the carbon emissions associated with using biomass pellets sourced from three Drax-owned mills in the southern US and combusted to generate about 4% of the UK\u2019s electricity. The original study, by Dr Thomas Buchholz of the Spatial Informatics Group, a scientific thinktank, found that the demand for wood pellets created by Drax would lead to reduced forest carbon stocks in managed pine forests in Louisiana and Mississippi which could raise atmospheric emissions for at least 40 years. An update to the study showed that the power plant\u2019s plan to fit carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to the plant by the 2030s would reduce this period of rising emissions but they would still be higher than they would otherwise be for decades, during a period that scientists have warned is crucial in addressing the climate crisis. \u201cThe results demonstrate that the CCS technology itself is less important than the impact of wood pellet sourcing on forest carbon stocks and flows,\u201d the study said. The company, which has claimed more than \u00a37bn in bill-payer-backed biomass subsidies since 2012, is in talks with the government to extend its subsidies from a 2027 end date until 2030 so it can fit CCS technology to the plant from 2030 to generate electricity with \u201cnegative emissions\u201d. These claims have been refuted by scientists, and the latest research is likely to reignite questions over Drax\u2019s green credentials and the government\u2019s support for biomass power. The government has thrown its weight behind CCS technology, pledging up to \u00a321.7bn of funding over 25 years to the industry last month. Chris Hinchliff, a Labour MP on the environmental audit committee, said: \u201cThe science behind Drax\u2019s claims to be able to achieve negative carbon emissions appears to be dangerously flawed. \u201cWith runaway climate change threatening our planet, tough choices need to be made. Public funds should not be spent on operations which are incompatible with the UK\u2019s commitment to achieving net zero by 2050. There are many other decarbonisation projects offering tangible climate benefits that are much more worthy of investment.\u201d In August, Drax agreed to pay the regulator a \u00a325m fine for submitting inaccurate data on the sourcing of wood pellets from Canada between April 2021 and the end of March 2022. The company has also faced claims, reported in the Financial Times, that it has used ecologically important wood sourced from old forests in Canada despite calls that these woods should be protected as their benefits include absorbing and storing atmospheric carbon for centuries. A spokesperson for Drax said the research was \u201cat odds with what the world\u2019s leading climate scientists say\u201d about the need for bioenergy fitted with carbon capture \u2013 known as Beccs \u2013 to remove carbon from the atmosphere. \u201cDrax is committed to rigorous data and transparent reporting to ensure our current biomass production and future Beccs activities support positive climate outcomes across all timescales, grounded in the best available science,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThis report is attempting to use limited science to validate what appears to be a predetermined view that Beccs is not sustainable.

Smith, who now runs the farm, sees chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019s changes to inheritance tax rules as a grave betrayal of British farmers.</p> <p>Working with his three sons, the farm produces about 2,000 sheep and 30 to 40 cows each year, yet makes \u201cno profit\u201d, he says. \u201cWe just pay the bills.\u201d</p> <p>Last Wednesday, Reeves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/reeves-accused-of-betraying-small-family-firms-with-inheritance-tax-rises\">announced</a> that, from April 2026, farms and other business property, which had been passed on to heirs tax-free, will fall within inheritance tax (IHT). Inheritors will have to pay 20% of their value above \u00a31m, half the headline inheritance tax rate of 40%.</p> <p>\u201cThe boys have been in the business with me since they left school,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThey have been bred to look after stock on the moors, which is a very difficult terrain to earn a living on. They were expecting to take it over from me, but this is the final nail in the coffin for family farms.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnce my sons are gone, you can\u2019t replace them, nobody else will have the experience on these hills, the food will just not get produced. It\u2019s the end of the line.\u201d</p> <p>Smith believes that the fact that UK family farming today is by default asset-rich but cash-poor has been entirely ignored by the chancellor\u2019s new rules.</p> <p>\u201cIf my farm is worth \u00a35m, my sons won\u2019t be able to pay \u00a3800,000 in inheritance tax, of course, they\u2019ll just have to sell half their land when I die. Then the farm will be unviable. Starmer has 100% <a href=\"https://x.com/NFUtweets/status/1851648406952837226\">broken a promise</a>; they lied.\u201d</p> <p>Smith is one of scores of farmers who responded to a Guardian callout asking about the planned changes. They raised concerns that Labour\u2019s policy will harm family farms, force them to stop food production, prevent investment in new technologies and break the chain between farming generations.</p> <p>Many said the policy would mean selling off land to larger, corporate agricultural businesses, or investors with limited interest in environmental concerns or communities and who would probably, as one farmer put it, \u201csimply watch balance sheets\u201d.</p> <p>The National Farmers\u2019 Union has labelled the plans \u201cdisastrous\u201d for the industry. The government said the change will only affect about 2,000 estates a year.</p> <h2>\u2018Why do we bother to produce food?\u2019</h2> <p>Jonathan Bell\u2019s family has been involved with farming going back at least to his great-grandfather.

If this is how the government treats farmers, he feels, \u201cWhy do we bother to produce food?\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Good in principle, but the threshold is too low\u2019</h2> <p>Andrew Brown, from Rutland in the East Midlands, owns about 100 acres of land, but he is mainly a tenant farmer producing wheat.</p> <p>He feels more ambivalent about Reeves\u2019s new rules. \u201cI think this is ultimately a good idea, because some of the very, very rich landowners aren\u2019t farmers, they\u2019re people who just bought land to take advantage of the IHT rules.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/02/austerity-farmers-questions-rachel-reeves-budget-labour-chancellor\">Is austerity over?

You can also type queries by double-tapping the gesture bar at the bottom of the screen, which is quite neat.

The tools are available everywhere the keyboard is, so pretty much in any app. But they are clearly designed for writing messages and emails, and struggled with longer documents, sometimes appearing blank for a few seconds before the text appeared. They weren\u2019t that useful in my day-to-day life beyond a more advanced spellcheck.</p> <p>The Mail app now puts urgent emails at the top and offers summaries of emails instead of the first line when viewing your inbox.

It also has a new AI Clean Up tool, similar to Google\u2019s Magic Eraser, that deletes objects from photos just by tapping or circling them with your finger. For simple removals of background or foreground objects it can work well, but struggles with anything complex, leaving odd-looking artefacts.</p> <p>The new voice transcription in the Notes app is fast, but with variable accuracy, tripping up on common words, phrases and names; good enough to get the gist, but not to be relied on for accuracy for now. You can also now record calls straight from the phone app, which alerts the caller that they are being recorded.</p> <p>None of these tools are novel, with arguably better versions already available from Google, including in the Gmail and Google Photos apps on an iPhone. But the new notification summaries are novel and useful.</p> <p>They condense and summarise groups of notifications, such as multiple WhatsApps, security camera events or even news app alerts. You can choose which apps it summarises, but set to do them all I found it worked better than expected.

      "bodyText": "The iPhone 16 Pro Max is Apple\u2019s latest superphone, with a massive screen, the fastest chip and the most advanced cameras on an iPhone, ready to be your entertainment powerhouse, if you can squeeze it into a pocket or bag. This enormous iPhone comes at an equally huge price. Starting at \u00a31,199 (\u20ac1,449/$1,199/A$2,149) the 16 Pro Max tops the iPhone 16 series, towering above the \u00a3999 16 Pro and \u00a3899 16 Plus, though, at least it comes with double the starting storage of the rest. Unlike their predecessors, the 16 Pro and Pro Max have matching cameras, chips and capabilities, providing a choice of size between a relatively compact 6.3in screen and the biggest ever fitted to an Apple phone. The 16 Pro Max\u2019s 6.9in screen is 0.2in bigger on the diagonal than the outgoing 15 Pro Max, which makes it one of the largest on the market, outstretching Samsung and Google\u2019s superphones. The display looks fantastic: bright, crisp and slick, with its 120Hz refresh rate to keep scrolling and animations smooth. For widescreen video the visible display is only 10% (18mm) shorter than the iPad mini, so it feels more like watching films on a small tablet than a phone. Thinner bezels around the screen have soaked up some of the display\u2019s increase in size but the 16 Pro Max is 6g heavier, 3.1mm longer and 1mm wider than its predecessor.

The 16 Pro Max can also shoot spatial photos and video for viewing on headsets such as the Vision Pro, and has Apple\u2019s excellent new audio mix feature that can cut out background noise and make it sound like those in the shot each have lapel mics. But it is Apple\u2019s upgraded photographic styles feature that makes the biggest difference, allowing you to adjust the tones and colours produced by the camera, either when shooting or after the fact. The camera control button works great for quickly opening the camera and shooting photos but is fiddly to use to adjust the camera settings with any precision. Price The iPhone 16 Pro Max costs from \u00a31,199 (\u20ac1,449/$1,199/A$2,149) with 256GB of storage. For comparison, the iPhone 16 costs \u00a3799, the iPhone 16 Plus costs \u00a3899, the iPhone 16 Pro costs \u00a3999, the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL costs \u00a31,099, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra costs \u00a31,249 and the Fairphone 5 costs \u00a3499. Verdict Apple\u2019s biggest iPhone has grown even larger for 2024, which is its key selling point and a bit of a hinderance. It has all the things you should expect from a superphone: an enormous and excellent screen, multiday battery life, a blazingly fast chip and excellent cameras capable of outshooting and out-zooming most regular phones. But its enormous size makes it hard to handle, giving me hand pain with prolonged use, and makes it more difficult to fit comfortably into pockets and bags.

      "body": "<p>Oulu is five hours north from Helsinki by train and a good deal colder and darker each winter than the Finnish capital. From November to March its 220,000 residents are lucky to see daylight for a couple of hours a day and temperatures can reach the minus 30s. However, this is not the reason I sense a darkening of the Finnish dream that brought me here six years ago.</p> <p>In 2018, moving to Finland seemed like a no-brainer. One year earlier I had met my Finnish partner while working away in Oulu. My adopted home of Italy, where I had lived for 10 years, had recently elected a coalition government with the far-right Matteo Salvini as interior minister, while my native UK had voted for Brexit. Given Finland\u2019s status as a beacon of progressive values, I boarded a plane, leaving my lecturing job and friends behind.</p> <p>Things have gone well. My partner and I both have stable teaching contracts, me at a university where my mostly Finnish colleagues are on the whole friendlier than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/27/scandinavian-miracle-brutal-truth-denmark-norway-sweden\">taciturn cliche </a>that persists of Finns (and which stands in puzzling contradiction to their status as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/28/world-happiest-nation-finland-nature-saunas\">world\u2019s happiest people</a>).</p> <p>Notwithstanding this, I feel a sense of unease as Finland\u2019s prime minister Petteri Orpo\u2019s rightwing coalition government has set about slashing welfare and capping public sector pay. Even on two teachers\u2019 salaries my partner and I have felt the sting of inflation as <a href=\"https://yle.fi/a/74-20119088\">goods have increased by 20% in three years</a>. With beer now costing \u20ac8 or more in a city centre pub, going out becomes an ever rarer expense.</p> <p>Those worse off than us face food scarcity. A survey conducted by the National Institute for Health and Welfare found <a href=\"https://yle.fi/a/74-20115068\">25% of students struggling to afford food</a>, while <a href=\"https://yle.fi/a/74-20116562\">reductions in housing benefit </a>mean tenants are being forced to move or absorb the shortfall in rent payments. There are concerns that many unemployed young people could become homeless.</p> <p>Healthcare is faring little better.

      "bodyText": "Oulu is five hours north from Helsinki by train and a good deal colder and darker each winter than the Finnish capital. From November to March its 220,000 residents are lucky to see daylight for a couple of hours a day and temperatures can reach the minus 30s. However, this is not the reason I sense a darkening of the Finnish dream that brought me here six years ago. In 2018, moving to Finland seemed like a no-brainer. One year earlier I had met my Finnish partner while working away in Oulu. My adopted home of Italy, where I had lived for 10 years, had recently elected a coalition government with the far-right Matteo Salvini as interior minister, while my native UK had voted for Brexit. Given Finland\u2019s status as a beacon of progressive values, I boarded a plane, leaving my lecturing job and friends behind. Things have gone well. My partner and I both have stable teaching contracts, me at a university where my mostly Finnish colleagues are on the whole friendlier than the taciturn cliche that persists of Finns (and which stands in puzzling contradiction to their status as the world\u2019s happiest people). Notwithstanding this, I feel a sense of unease as Finland\u2019s prime minister Petteri Orpo\u2019s rightwing coalition government has set about slashing welfare and capping public sector pay. Even on two teachers\u2019 salaries my partner and I have felt the sting of inflation as goods have increased by 20% in three years. With beer now costing \u20ac8 or more in a city centre pub, going out becomes an ever rarer expense. Those worse off than us face food scarcity. A survey conducted by the National Institute for Health and Welfare found 25% of students struggling to afford food, while reductions in housing benefit mean tenants are being forced to move or absorb the shortfall in rent payments. There are concerns that many unemployed young people could become homeless. Healthcare is faring little better. Finland\u2019s two-tier system means that while civil servants and local government employees (including teachers) paradoxically enjoy private health cover, many other people face long waiting lists. Not having dental cover on my university\u2019s plan, I called for a public dental appointment in April. I was put on callback and received a text message stating I\u2019d be contacted when the waiting list reopened. Six months later, I am still waiting.

The current government, formed by Orpo\u2019s National Coalition party (NCP) last year in coalition with the far-right Finns party, the Swedish People\u2019s party of Finland and the Christian Democrats, has been described as \u201cthe most rightwing\u201d Finland has ever seen \u2013 a position it appears to relish. Deputy prime minister and finance minister Riikka Purra \u2013 the Finns\u2019 party leader \u2013 has been linked to racist and sometimes violent comments made online back in 2008. The party\u2019s xenophobia is clearly influencing policymaking and affecting migrants. As a foreigner, I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t admit to feeling a certain chill as anti-immigrant rhetoric ramps up. A survey by the organisation Specialists in Finland last year found that most highly qualified workers would consider leaving Finland if the government\u2019s planned tightening of visa requirements went ahead (that proposal, which extended residence time required for Finnish citizenship from four to as many as eight years has now become law).

      "bodyText": "A London poet has accused the bestselling author Coco Mellors of basing one of her characters on him, saying the experience has been \u201charmful\u201d and led to him having a \u201cmini identity crisis\u201d. James Massiah, who created a lengthy Instagram post that points out the similarities between him and the character Charlie in Mellors\u2019 Blue Sisters novel, told the Guardian he did so after more than half a dozen people had asked him if the character was inspired by him. Coco Mellors became a major literary star after the success of her debut Cleopatra and Frankenstein, which sold 200,000 copies, and her latest novel has been one of the most talked about books of this year. Likened to Little Women by some critics, Blue Sisters became an instant bestseller upon its release in May. The book follows the lives of three sisters and their at times turbulent relationships that are affected by addiction and the death of a sibling. Massiah\u2019s friends and acquaintances \u2013 all independently from each other \u2013 told the London poet that a character called \u201cCharlie\u201d bore a strong resemblance to him. He said: \u201cPeople were sending little bits of copy and details from the book, \u2018he lives with his parents\u2019 or little funny things like that. I went to check it out for myself and was like \u2018This is me!\u2019.\u201d The character has a relationship with one of the sisters, Avery, after they meet at an Alcoholics Anonymous group. Like Massiah, Charlie is also a black poet, who lived at home with his parents in London. He\u2019s also spoken openly about his drug use, sexuality and strict religious upbringing \u2013 just as Charlie does in Blue Sisters. Like the character, he runs a poetry night in an east London pub where a young crowd \u201csit cross-legged on the floor\u201d, as they do in Blue Sisters. Charlie and Avery debate the concept of \u201camoral egoism\u201d, an idea that Massiah has regularly mentioned in interviews, while the character talks about his \u201cparty poetry\u201d \u2013 a phrase Massiah has repeatedly used to describe his art. Mellors and Massiah had been acquaintances before the novelist became a BookTok sensation and one of the writers most closely associated with the \u201csad girl literature\u201d trend. Massiah says they first exchanged messages over Instagram before meeting and becoming friends in 2018. The pair had periods when they did not speak, he says, but they were in contact shortly before the novel\u2019s release, but Mellors did not mention Charlie or his similarities to Massiah. In interviews promoting the book, Mellors has spoken about wanting to create a novel that is \u201cdeeply compassionate about addiction\u201d (she has been eight years sober) and also be \u201can example of creativity that isn\u2019t self-destructive\u201d. But Massiah says the creation of a character that is so similar to him \u2013 both in terms of biographical details but also worldview and even the speech he uses \u2013 has caused him distress. After several people contacted Massiah about the character, he said he began to have a \u201cmini identity crisis\u201d, and eventually confronted Mellors, asking if the character was based on him. She said that he was not. Massiah says he told her he was going to investigate for himself and when so many biographical details matched his, he asked her again if it was based on him. This time Massiah claims Mellors said she should have told him about the character before the book was published. \u201cMore than anything else I think it would have been nice for her to have let me know beforehand,\u201d says Massiah. \u201cTo say \u2013 there\u2019s a character in the book I\u2019m writing and he bears some similarities to you. Just know that and this book is coming out and I\u2019ve based some elements of this character on you and your life and some of the conversations you\u2019ve had with me\u2019. \u201cThat would have been nice and would have shown some consideration.\u201d Authors often go to great lengths to ensure characters based on real people cannot be identified in their work. Details such as age, race and gender can be changed to ensure real people cannot be recognised by others. Writers who do not can face claims for libel and for breach of privacy. Kristen Roupenian\u2019s viral 2017 short story, Cat Person, became the centre of a debate about using real-life people as the basis for fictional characters. The story was about a young woman called Margot and an older man called Robert, who was depicted negatively. After it was published another writer, Alexis Nowicki, alleged that biographical details in the story were taken from her life and a relationship she had with an older man. \u201cWhat\u2019s difficult about having your relationship rewritten and memorialised in the most viral short story of all time is the sensation that millions of people now know that relationship as described by a stranger,\u201d wrote Nowicki. Massiah said that having details from his life appear in a bestselling novel has been confusing and unsettling. \u201cI want some acknowledgment or maybe an apology, or that this was really harmful to a person,\u201d he said.

This region doesn\u2019t have the lifts and other infrastructure of a major ski resort, just a couple of cat skiing (a form of backcountry skiing) operations, and even they don\u2019t venture where we tourers are going. We\u2019ve come for the untracked snow and the chance to cross three countries in a day, surrounded by a&nbsp;glistening white wilderness with just a few secluded hamlets.

Quickly clipping our skis into downhill ski mode, we escape the lingering mists of Albania and descend into the sun-drenched landscape of Kosovo, carving through the powdery snow. There is still plenty of time for another lap in this pristine winter landscape before we have to ski down through the fir-lined Kosovan valley of Zalli Rupes and end our ski tour around the Accursed Mountains.</p> <p>Climbing alongside Arb, I am struck by how fast the clouds are moving above us. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons they are called the Accursed Mountains,\u201d Arb tells me. But there are several reasons. One traces the origins of the name to Serbian soldiers\u2019 harrowing journey through these mountains during the first world war in a bid to take their king, Peter I, to safety in Corfu. Another says they were created by the devil.</p>    <p>Our journey had started a week earlier in Peja, at the base of the eastern end of the mountain range.

So he persuaded three guesthouses to open up for the season and started <a href=\"https://bnadventure.com/\">Balkans Natural Adventure</a>. We spend the nights in&nbsp;these guesthouses on our tour.</p>    <p>The following morning we set off from Hotel Kulla e Zenel Beut towards the Accursed Mountains national park by road. With our skis and luggage strapped on the top of the van, we navigate steep forest tracks and rocky streams, ascending towards snow-dusted peaks on the horizon. Eventually, we pull up at the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/gacaferiguesthouse/\">Gacaferi guesthouse</a> in a snowy valley in De\u00e7an province in western Kosovo.</p> <p>From there, our luggage goes up on skidoos, while we ascend the Ali Peja Pass, revealing a panorama of jagged mountains and pristine valleys. After a two-hour climb we reach the summit of two rounded 2,300-metre peaks, which, like many around the region, haven\u2019t been named yet. These offer views of the Dob\u00ebrdol and Valbona valleys on the Albanian border, while Kosovo\u2019s Gjeravica, the second-highest Accursed peak at 2,656 metres, towers behind us.</p> <p>On our return to the guesthouse after skiing for 30 minutes through soft snow, Safete Gacaferi welcomes us with cups of Turkish coffee in front of&nbsp;a blazing fire. </p> <p>After a long day, we relax in comfy sofas around the stove, watching the hard work going on in the kitchen. Safete prepares pita by rolling out pieces of dough into thin circles and spreading them with a creamy milk concoction known as <em>halta</em>, before winding them into spirals and baking them. We eat them with homemade meatballs and peppers in cream, before retiring to our shared rooms with their comfy, single beds.</p>    <p>The following morning we set off on&nbsp;skis into a crisp monochrome landscape, with the aim of visiting three countries in a few seconds. Reaching the top of Trekufiri (2,366 metres), where the three borders meet, we link hands and call out each country\u2019s name \u2013 Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo \u2013 as we circle the summit cairn. We then descend towards an empty hamlet, Bogi\u0107evica, where we are welcomed by a jovial border patrol officer, his curiosity piqued by the novelty of winter guests. A former army truck, fitted out with a trailer for our skis, takes us on a bumpy ride to Babino Polje in Montenegro, the vehicle lurching into action after several attempts.</p> <p>At the Eko Katun Hrid guesthouse we are greeted by Enes \u201cEnko\u201d Dreskovic\u2019s children, who offer us homemade blueberry juice and warm slippers. The guesthouse is remote enough to lack a phone signal but has&nbsp;hot showers in the newly built apartments, which have double and&nbsp;single beds spread out over two&nbsp;floors. We drift off to sleep to the sound of the&nbsp;river below.</p>    <p>The main building is a&nbsp;traditional family house with a large, warm living room and kitchen. Enko is&nbsp;a towering figure who is also the director of Montenegro\u2019s Prokletije national park. Over a dinner of lamb chops, fried fish, chicken and potatoes, he shares stories about his 20 years of involvement in creating national parks in the three countries. His vision is to unite the parks and break down boundaries. \u201cPeople here are the same, regardless of nationality,\u201d he says. \u201cYour neighbour can be closer than your brother.\u201d</p> <p>Over the next two days, we visit remote hamlets such as Dob\u00ebrdol in Albania, staying at <a href=\"https://peaksofthebalkans.info/guest-houses/\">guesthouse Leonardi</a>, one of the most secluded spots yet. From here, we ski tour to Shpati Peak (2,203 metres), following the breathtaking ridge line leading to Kershi Kocit before returning to the warmth of the guesthouse, where Arb unveils a bottle of raki.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for a toast,\u201d he declares, raising a glass to the untamed beauty of the Accursed Mountains, where borders blur and you can\u2019t always be sure of which country you are in.</p> <p><em>The trip was provided by <a href=\"https://bnadventure.com/\">Balkans Natural Adventure</a></em><em>; its seven-day </em><em>holiday costs </em><em>about \u20ac1,500, including local&nbsp;guides, transfers&nbsp;and some meals</em></p>",

A former army truck, fitted out with a trailer for our skis, takes us on a bumpy ride to Babino Polje in Montenegro, the vehicle lurching into action after several attempts. At the Eko Katun Hrid guesthouse we are greeted by Enes \u201cEnko\u201d Dreskovic\u2019s children, who offer us homemade blueberry juice and warm slippers. The guesthouse is remote enough to lack a phone signal but has hot showers in the newly built apartments, which have double and single beds spread out over two floors. We drift off to sleep to the sound of the river below. The main building is a traditional family house with a large, warm living room and kitchen. Enko is a towering figure who is also the director of Montenegro\u2019s Prokletije national park. Over a dinner of lamb chops, fried fish, chicken and potatoes, he shares stories about his 20 years of involvement in creating national parks in the three countries. His vision is to unite the parks and break down boundaries. \u201cPeople here are the same, regardless of nationality,\u201d he says. \u201cYour neighbour can be closer than your brother.\u201d Over the next two days, we visit remote hamlets such as Dob\u00ebrdol in Albania, staying at guesthouse Leonardi, one of the most secluded spots yet. From here, we ski tour to Shpati Peak (2,203 metres), following the breathtaking ridge line leading to Kershi Kocit before returning to the warmth of the guesthouse, where Arb unveils a bottle of raki. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a toast,\u201d he declares, raising a glass to the untamed beauty of the Accursed Mountains, where borders blur and you can\u2019t always be sure of which country you are in. The trip was provided by Balkans Natural Adventure; its seven-day holiday costs about \u20ac1,500, including local guides, transfers and some meals",

That is not time to plot the next five years in any detail.

That\u2019s not what happened in practice, Henry said. \u201cPartly that was because the party so much wanted to avoid a repeat of 2022, with Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak hammering each other in public for months.\u201d</p> <p>To that end, the 1922 Committee instituted a \u201cyellow card\u201d system where any candidate who attacked a rival would be given a public dressing down by chair Bob Blackman. \u201cBut realistically, \u2018blue on blue\u2019 attacks would be how scrutiny happened,\u201d Henry said.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/01/tory-leadership-contest-badenoch-jenrick\">this piece on Friday</a>, Henry wrote that Badenoch\u2019s attempt at a pithy analysis of the party\u2019s failure \u2013 that it \u201ctalked right, but governed left\u201d was \u201ca fine description of a symptom, but \u2026 falls short of a diagnosis; we\u2019ve heard nothing about why this was, or what \u2018governing right\u2019 would look like under a Badenoch premiership\u201d. </p> <p>The result of this gap is that in her first interview as leader, with the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg yesterday (on which she appeared with Reeves, pictured above), she was asked more about her predecessors than about her criticisms of Labour. \u201cIf you want to turn the page you need a credible explanation of what went wrong,\u201d Henry said. \u201cAnd she doesn\u2019t seem to have one yet.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Flesh out her agenda and take the fight to Labour</strong></p> <p>Badenoch\u2019s campaign was distinguished from her rival Robert Jenrick\u2019s by the fact that, while she has been viewed as occupying similar territory on the right, she sought to present herself as a figure with at least some appeal to the party\u2019s more moderate wing: calling his pledge to leave the European convention on human rights a \u201cdistraction from bigger worries\u201d, for example.</p> <p>She has also said that she will \u201clead by consensus\u201d. Which sounds fine, obviously \u2013 but, said Henry, \u201cshe submarined her way through this contest. The problem is that there <em>is</em> no consensus about the party\u2019s direction\u201d. The ECHR is a case in point.</p> <p>During the campaign, Badenoch declined to lay out a policy programme, <a href=\"https://conservativehome.com/2024/09/03/its-not-about-just-having-a-different-policy-offer-badenoch-in-conversation-with-our-editor/#:~:text=there%E2%80%99s%20going%20to%20be%20an%20internal%20party%20policy%20review%20if%20I%20do%20win%2C%20but%20there%E2%80%99s%20also%20going%20to%20be%20a%20second%20track%20of%20just%20being%20a%20good%20opposition\">saying to ConservativeHome</a>: \u201cthere\u2019s going to be an internal party policy review if I do win, but there\u2019s also going to be a second track of just being a good opposition.\u201d</p> <p>In her Kuenssberg interview, she promised to tell \u201chard truths\u201d, and she had one particularly bracing observation: \u201cas a country we are getting poorer and older\u201d. That might be the kernel of a coherent Conservative attack on the affordability of Labour\u2019s plans, but it\u2019s not exactly an optimistic message, and because she didn\u2019t lay out the detail during the campaign, many of her supporters may not quite have understood what they\u2019ve signed up for.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Assemble a plausible team</strong></p> <p>Badenoch started to assemble her shadow cabinet last night with the appointment of Rebecca Harris as chief whip. But the electoral defeat was so heavy that by the time she\u2019s finished, the frontbenches may be busier than the back ones. As Peter Walker points out in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/02/hard-to-overstate-challenges-kemi-badenoch-faces-as-leader-of-the-opposition\">this analysis</a>, there are 124 Labour MPs with government jobs \u2013 which is more than the total number of Tories returned to parliament.</p> <p>\u201cYou arguably only need people in key positions,\u201d Henry said, because so much of the job of opposition is appearing in the media. \u201cBut the result does mean that there is potentially a talent issue. She won\u2019t be able to afford many resignations, and the shadow cabinet will have to be a broad church.\u201d</p> <p>Its members will know that it is hard for her to get rid of them, and they will hail from all wings of the party \u2013 which may make enforcing any sweeping changes to the party\u2019s platform a serious challenge. Also, other than semi-retired grandees and the class of 2024, anyone who doesn\u2019t get in when the field is so thin is likely to be seriously cheesed off.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Revitalise the party</strong></p> <p>One worrying feature of the leadership contest for the Conservatives: the size of the electorate. Just 95,849 people voted, against 141,725 in 2022 and 256,857 back in 2001: that change is a result of a long-term decline in membership, and a fair number of party members being less fussed about choosing a leader of the opposition than a prime minister.</p> <p>The decline in party identification is not just a Conservative problem \u2013 but its membership does skew older, and so the question is a more urgent one.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not really a society that joins things much any more,\u201d said Henry. \u201cBut the party needs activists \u2013 crucially, it needs those more than it needs headline membership. It needs people who\u2019ll actually campaign, collect data, organise.\u201d </p> <p>In her ConservativeHome interview, Badenoch said there was a \u201cunique opportunity to turn our party into a mass membership organisation \u2026 that attracts people of all ages.\u201d But she was short on specifics about how, saying it would need a lot of \u201cdeep thinking\u201d and consultation. Figuring this out should \u201cabsolutely be a priority\u201d, Henry said, along with reforming CCHQ.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Lose her reputation for combustibility</strong></p> <p>When Badenoch\u2019s campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/sep/29/maternity-pay-is-excessive-says-tory-leadership-hopeful-kemi-badenoch\">did get the headlines</a>, it wasn\u2019t for ideal reasons: her most high profile intervention was her suggestion that maternity pay is \u201cexcessive\u201d. Just as notable was the way she reacted to coverage: she denied saying something which most fair-minded observers thought she clearly did, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/29/kemi-badenoch-backlash-tory-rivals-maternity-pay-comments\">and added</a>: \u201cI don\u2019t shy from difficult topics, but I won\u2019t be misrepresented.\u201d</p> <p>Badenoch has a bit of a record of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jan/29/minister-kemi-badenoch-under-fire-over-tweets-about-journalist-who-sent-her-questions\">this sort of thing</a>, and a reputation for picking fights with no discernible political benefit. Is she too abrasive to be a successful leader? \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see,\u201d Henry said. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely been concern about her historic lack of enthusiasm for media, given that Leader of the opposition is in large part a media role.\u201d If Labour descends into civil war over the next few years, he pointed out, it may be more effective to stay above the fray \u2013 especially as \u201cvoters have Reform and the Lib Dems to consider if they reach 2029 unhappy with the government\u201d.</p> <p>A related problem: \u201cThere are also party management implications for someone not having or building a large number of personal loyalists, as we\u2019ve seen before.\u201d The question of what voters will think of her is obviously crucial, in other words \u2013 but there are many mountains to climb before that one.</p> <h2>What else we\u2019re reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>I am a sucker for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/nov/04/guardian-sports-writers-and-arts-critics-swap-jobs-for-one-day\">a good journalistic wheeze</a>, and making the Guardian\u2019s <strong>culture critics and sports writers swap jobs</strong> for the day is an absolute classic.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. Kemi Badenoch was elected as Conservative leader over the weekend, and now has a window of about two minutes of mainstream attention before the US election devours the entire news agenda. That is not time to plot the next five years in any detail. But it doesn\u2019t take long to observe just how stiff the challenge she faces will be. The contest was billed as a postmortem of the election defeat \u2013 but as it played out, we don\u2019t even know in any detail why Badenoch thinks the Tories lost. She said yesterday that the threat of Reform UK was a symptom of her party not being \u201cconsistent enough about values\u201d \u2013 without being specific about what that would mean in practice.

For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to Henry Hill, deputy editor of ConservativeHome, about the task facing Badenoch if she is to succeed. Here are the headlines. Five big stories US election | In the final stretch of the presidential race, Donald Trump has said he should never have left the White House after his defeat in 2020 and joked darkly he would be fine with reporters getting shot. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris promised to work to end the war in Gaza as she attempted to appeal to Arab American and Muslim American voters in Michigan. Europe | The pro-western incumbent Maia Sandu has won a second term in office in the Moldovan presidential election, preliminary results have shown, marking a significant boost for the country\u2019s EU aspirations and a clear rebuke to Moscow. Labour | Rachel Reeves has admitted she was wrong to say before the election that no major tax rises would be needed, but promised there was \u201cno need to increase taxes further\u201d after last week\u2019s budget raised \u00a340bn. Spain | Hundreds of people have heckled Spain\u2019s King Felipe and prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez \u2013 throwing mud and shouting \u201cmurderers\u201d \u2013 as they visited an area in Valencia devastated by last week\u2019s floods. The scenes laid bare the degree of anger among residents who feel abandoned by the authorities. Work | One thousand workers in the UK will get extra time off with no loss of pay in the first official pilot by the four-day week campaign under the Labour government. Amid growing momentum for a shorter working week, the campaign will present its findings in the summer. In depth: \u2018She doesn\u2019t have a mandate for any particular direction\u2019 With the election of Kemi Badenoch, John Harris writes, the gap between Labour and Conservative diagnoses of Britain\u2019s ills could hardly be larger: \u201cThe UK seems to be moving towards a politics that simultaneously happens on two different planets.\u201d In Badenoch\u2019s view, as set out in a pamphlet (pdf) published by her campaign, the country is being hamstrung by a swollen bureaucracy which is obsessed with identity politics. In theory, the choice on offer to voters versus the programme set out by Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves last week should be a clear one. But Badenoch has not really fleshed that out \u2013 and she has a lot to do besides staking out her political territory on the right. Here are some of the key challenges as she becomes Tory leader. *** Come up with a credible diagnosis of what went wrong The theory of a long leadership contest was that it would provide the space for a serious reckoning with the scale of the electoral defeat. That\u2019s not what happened in practice, Henry said. \u201cPartly that was because the party so much wanted to avoid a repeat of 2022, with Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak hammering each other in public for months.\u201d To that end, the 1922 Committee instituted a \u201cyellow card\u201d system where any candidate who attacked a rival would be given a public dressing down by chair Bob Blackman. \u201cBut realistically, \u2018blue on blue\u2019 attacks would be how scrutiny happened,\u201d Henry said.

But the electoral defeat was so heavy that by the time she\u2019s finished, the frontbenches may be busier than the back ones. As Peter Walker points out in this analysis, there are 124 Labour MPs with government jobs \u2013 which is more than the total number of Tories returned to parliament. \u201cYou arguably only need people in key positions,\u201d Henry said, because so much of the job of opposition is appearing in the media. \u201cBut the result does mean that there is potentially a talent issue. She won\u2019t be able to afford many resignations, and the shadow cabinet will have to be a broad church.\u201d Its members will know that it is hard for her to get rid of them, and they will hail from all wings of the party \u2013 which may make enforcing any sweeping changes to the party\u2019s platform a serious challenge. Also, other than semi-retired grandees and the class of 2024, anyone who doesn\u2019t get in when the field is so thin is likely to be seriously cheesed off. *** Revitalise the party One worrying feature of the leadership contest for the Conservatives: the size of the electorate. Just 95,849 people voted, against 141,725 in 2022 and 256,857 back in 2001: that change is a result of a long-term decline in membership, and a fair number of party members being less fussed about choosing a leader of the opposition than a prime minister. The decline in party identification is not just a Conservative problem \u2013 but its membership does skew older, and so the question is a more urgent one. \u201cWe\u2019re not really a society that joins things much any more,\u201d said Henry. \u201cBut the party needs activists \u2013 crucially, it needs those more than it needs headline membership. It needs people who\u2019ll actually campaign, collect data, organise.\u201d In her ConservativeHome interview, Badenoch said there was a \u201cunique opportunity to turn our party into a mass membership organisation \u2026 that attracts people of all ages.\u201d But she was short on specifics about how, saying it would need a lot of \u201cdeep thinking\u201d and consultation. Figuring this out should \u201cabsolutely be a priority\u201d, Henry said, along with reforming CCHQ. *** Lose her reputation for combustibility When Badenoch\u2019s campaign did get the headlines, it wasn\u2019t for ideal reasons: her most high profile intervention was her suggestion that maternity pay is \u201cexcessive\u201d. Just as notable was the way she reacted to coverage: she denied saying something which most fair-minded observers thought she clearly did, and added: \u201cI don\u2019t shy from difficult topics, but I won\u2019t be misrepresented.\u201d Badenoch has a bit of a record of this sort of thing, and a reputation for picking fights with no discernible political benefit. Is she too abrasive to be a successful leader? \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see,\u201d Henry said. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely been concern about her historic lack of enthusiasm for media, given that Leader of the opposition is in large part a media role.\u201d If Labour descends into civil war over the next few years, he pointed out, it may be more effective to stay above the fray \u2013 especially as \u201cvoters have Reform and the Lib Dems to consider if they reach 2029 unhappy with the government\u201d. A related problem: \u201cThere are also party management implications for someone not having or building a large number of personal loyalists, as we\u2019ve seen before.\u201d The question of what voters will think of her is obviously crucial, in other words \u2013 but there are many mountains to climb before that one. What else we\u2019re reading I am a sucker for a good journalistic wheeze, and making the Guardian\u2019s culture critics and sports writers swap jobs for the day is an absolute classic.

      "bodyText": "A police theory that William Tyrrell\u2019s foster mother loaded his body into a car and disposed of it close to where he died will be examined as an inquest into the toddler\u2019s disappearance reopens. The three-year-old went missing while playing at his foster grandmother\u2019s home in Kendall, on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, on 12 September 2014. On Monday, counsel assisting Gerard Craddock SC reopened the inquest for a fifth round of evidence, saying the focus would be on a theory the foster mother was involved in unlawfully disposing of William\u2019s body after his accidental death. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email He said the prevailing theory was that the boy\u2019s foster mother found him already deceased after a fall from the balcony at the Kendall property. Police believe the foster mother might have then loaded his body into her mother\u2019s Mazda. Police believe she then alerted a neighbour to the boy\u2019s alleged disappearance, before driving down the road to dispose of his remains in some undergrowth, the deputy NSW coroner Harriet Grahame heard. It was only then that she called triple zero, according to investigators\u2019 theory. \u201cPolice assert that she must have quickly resolved that if the accidental death were to be discovered, she might lose [her other foster child],\u201d Craddock said. As part of the renewed investigation based on that theory, police seized the Mazda and conducted a forensic search of Batar Creek Road, where they believe the body was placed. Craddock said that 2021 search \u201cleft nothing to chance\u201d. The foster mother has always denied having anything to do with William\u2019s disappearance. The inquest on Monday heard from Prof Jon Olley, a Griffith University expert in geomorphology who helped police design and carry out the extensive 2021 search. He said layers of vegetation and sediment were removed at designated locations downstream from the property where Tyrell was last seen. Vegetation and soil were excavated and searched up to 10 metres from the edge of Battar Creek Road, River Oaks Drive and Cobb and Co Road. Soil in buckets was examined by hand and water was pumped from the nearby creek. Animal bones were found but no bones or clothing belonging to William were located, Olley said. The expert said the vegetation was so thick it would have been impossible for anyone to travel too deep into the bush. Olley said \u201cin our assessment, raking and removing all of the vegetation, all the loose leaf litter, and then raking through what\u2019s underneath \u2013 that would pick up any remains\u201d. He said through consultation with another expert it was determined wild dogs could have taken William\u2019s bones if they had been placed within the search area. \u201cI wrote an email to a wild dogs expert and asked him a series of questions which related to whether, if remains were there, could they have been removed from the site by animals. And he responded saying \u2018absolutely, yes\u2019.\u201d The polyester Spider-Man suit William was wearing when he disappeared would have lasted hundreds of years if the three-year-old\u2019s body had been dumped in it in a local creek, Olley said. Rubber-soled shoes and sandals would have lasted for decades before breaking down. Further evidence was scheduled this week from a truck driver who drove past the site where the foster mother allegedly disposed of the body. The inquest into William\u2019s disappearance began in March 2019 but was adjourned in October 2020. No one has been charged in the case and a $1m reward for information still stands. Despite a decade-long investigation involving hundreds of persons of interest and dozens of searches, no trace of the boy has been found. The current round of the inquest will examine the 2021 search of the Kendall property and surrounds \u2013 the third by police into William\u2019s whereabouts. Craddock said after an initial search for the toddler in September 2014, further sweeps of the area using GPS trackers and police dogs were conducted in 2018 and 2021. \u201cThe 2018 forensic search was an intensive, thorough search,\u201d he said. \u201cBy comparison, the 2021 search was at a further level of intensity.\u201d In looking for William, police followed through on tip-offs from prison inmates and clairvoyants claiming to have information. One lead involved a car that was heard doing a U-turn in the street outside the foster grandmother\u2019s home about the time of the disappearance, Craddock said on Monday. But police had been unable to verify that information or track down the vehicle. The inquest continues.",

Police believe she then alerted a neighbour to the boy\u2019s alleged disappearance, before driving down the road to dispose of his remains in some undergrowth, the deputy NSW coroner, Harriet Grahame, heard. The inquest into William\u2019s disappearance began in March 2019 but was adjourned in October 2020. No one has been charged in the case and there remains a $1m reward for information.

      "bodyText": "England will not be \u201csmoke-free\u201d until 2039, missing a key public health target by almost a decade, an analysis has found. While smoking rates are in decline they are not falling fast enough to realise the government\u2019s ambition of England being \u201csmoke-free\u201d by 2030, according to Cancer Research UK (CRUK). And stark socioeconomic inequalities in smoking \u2013 with poorer people much more likely to light up than the well-off \u2013 will continue for decades to come, its research shows. In 2019, the government announced its intention for England to be \u201csmoke-free\u201d by 2030, which it defined as 5% of adults, or fewer, still smoking. It is a key measure of progress towards improving the population\u2019s health, given smoking causes almost 80,000 deaths a year across the UK from cancer, heart disease and other conditions and costs the NHS billions to treat. However, CRUK\u2019s latest analysis of when the 5% target will be reached has concluded that it will not be until 2039, even though smoking rates are expected to keep coming down in the next few years. \u201cOur updated projections, based on the continuation of recent trends, indicate that smoking prevalence will continue to fall in England, but not fast enough to achieve the smoke-free ambition set out. \u201cIf recent trends continue, England will achieve 5% average adult smoking prevalence in 2039 \u2013 almost a decade behind schedule,\u201d it says. About 6 million UK adults \u2013 fewer than one in eight (11.9%) \u2013 smoke, the lowest proportion on record and down from 20.2% in 2011, according to the most recent Office for National Statistics data. England has the lowest prevalence (11.6%) \u2013 4.9 million people there still smoke \u2013 and Scotland the highest (13.5%). Although that downward trend is expected to continue, CRUK\u2019s projections show that even this will not narrow what it calls \u201cthe deprivation gap\u201d in smoking habits. For example, smoking prevalence is expected to hit the 5% target among the best-off tenth of the population by 2025 but will still be stuck around the same 5% figure for the poorest tenth until 2050. In addition, even when the smoke-free target is finally achieved in 2039, almost four times as many of the poorest people will still be using tobacco than the wealthiest. \u201cWhen England is projected to reach smoke-free in 2039, of the remaining 5% of people who still smoke, more than 459,000 people in the most deprived tenth of the population will still smoke, compared with about 119,000 in the least deprived tenth. \u201cBy 2039, almost two in 10 (17.47%) people who smoke in England are estimated to live in the most deprived tenth of areas,\u201d the charity\u2019s analysis found. In comparison, 4.54% of the best-off tenth of the population will still be smoking by 2039. Michelle Mitchell, CRUK\u2019s chief executive, urged the government to publish its long-promised tobacco and vapes bill as soon as possible, to help speed the shift away from smoking. \u201cEvery day around 160 people in the UK are diagnosed with cancer as a result of smoking. The government must prioritise the health of the nation by introducing the Tobacco and vapes bill without further delay. Continued hesitation could disrupt the path to a smoke-free UK.\u201d The Guardian disclosed recently that the bill has been delayed amid opposition within No 10 to going ahead with a plan to ban smoking in some outdoor areas, such as pub gardens. The Department of Health and Social Care did not respond directly to CRUK\u2019s findings. A spokesperson said: \u201cSmoking is the number one preventable cause of death, disability and ill-health, claiming the lives of 80,000 people a year in the UK. \u201cThe tobacco and vapes bill will be the biggest public health intervention in a generation, tackling the harms of smoking, breaking the cycle of addiction and paving the way for a smoke-free UK.\u201d",

Going to school meant an escape from the dark, tin-roof home she shared with her mother in a poorer part of Makadara, a high-density neighbourhood on the south side of Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi.</p> <p>She disliked that their house sat directly in front of an open sewer and had walls so thin she knew exactly what her neighbours were up to. But it was the boredom between naps and chores she dreaded the most.</p> <p>At school she had friends, a routine and could imagine a better life for herself and her mother, Mueni<em>*</em>, an informal worker who left the house each morning in search of the odd job, unsure whether she would return with cash or empty handed.</p> <p>But in 2014, Esther\u2019s grade six teacher announced that students would need to bring in their birth certificates to register for national examinations. The seemingly minor requirement morphed into an obstacle that would later push Esther out of education altogether.</p>    <p>Her estranged father had her birth certificate and the prospects of finding him were poor, while her mother\u2019s attempts to get a copy from government offices ran up against bureaucratic obstacles. Officials sent her back and forth between their offices in Nairobi and Kitui \u2013 nearly 185km from the capital \u2013 as Mueni struggled to pay the bus fare on her meagre daily wages.</p> <p>Lack of documentation is a common problem for women, rural families and people with poor literacy skills, according to a <a href=\"https://unu.edu/cpr/project/modern-slavery-risks-among-people-lacking-official-documentation\">recent UN report</a>, which warned it was depriving them of basic services such as education, and pushing them into informal employment.</p> <p>Esther was repeatedly sent home for not producing the document and as she watched her mother\u2019s failed efforts and their financial situation become more precarious, she became dispirited.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see the point of staying in school if I wouldn\u2019t be able to take [the exams]. I felt there wasn\u2019t a path forward for me there,\u201d she says.</p>    <p>Instead, aged 11, she quietly dropped out against her mother\u2019s wishes and later ran away from home. She had heard from a friend that a family in a lower-middle-income residential Nairobi suburb were looking for a housekeeper.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The family promised to treat Esther \u2018like a daughter\u2019, but soon began overworking her and withholding her pay</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The first family Esther worked for, aged 12, promised to \u201ctreat her like a daughter\u201d and to pay her \u00a317 (3,000 Kenyan shillings) a month, but soon began overworking her and withholding her pay.</p> <p>\u201cShe [the employer] said: \u2018why should I pay you when you\u2019re eating and living here for free?\u2019,\u201d says Esther. \u201cI\u2019d get up at 3am to clean the house and get the kids ready for school and work until the family went to bed.

      "bodyText": "As a preteen, Esther*, now 20, says she could not wait for the weekdays to come around. Going to school meant an escape from the dark, tin-roof home she shared with her mother in a poorer part of Makadara, a high-density neighbourhood on the south side of Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi. She disliked that their house sat directly in front of an open sewer and had walls so thin she knew exactly what her neighbours were up to. But it was the boredom between naps and chores she dreaded the most. At school she had friends, a routine and could imagine a better life for herself and her mother, Mueni*, an informal worker who left the house each morning in search of the odd job, unsure whether she would return with cash or empty handed. But in 2014, Esther\u2019s grade six teacher announced that students would need to bring in their birth certificates to register for national examinations. The seemingly minor requirement morphed into an obstacle that would later push Esther out of education altogether. Her estranged father had her birth certificate and the prospects of finding him were poor, while her mother\u2019s attempts to get a copy from government offices ran up against bureaucratic obstacles. Officials sent her back and forth between their offices in Nairobi and Kitui \u2013 nearly 185km from the capital \u2013 as Mueni struggled to pay the bus fare on her meagre daily wages. Lack of documentation is a common problem for women, rural families and people with poor literacy skills, according to a recent UN report, which warned it was depriving them of basic services such as education, and pushing them into informal employment. Esther was repeatedly sent home for not producing the document and as she watched her mother\u2019s failed efforts and their financial situation become more precarious, she became dispirited. \u201cI didn\u2019t see the point of staying in school if I wouldn\u2019t be able to take [the exams]. I felt there wasn\u2019t a path forward for me there,\u201d she says. Instead, aged 11, she quietly dropped out against her mother\u2019s wishes and later ran away from home. She had heard from a friend that a family in a lower-middle-income residential Nairobi suburb were looking for a housekeeper. The first family Esther worked for, aged 12, promised to \u201ctreat her like a daughter\u201d and to pay her \u00a317 (3,000 Kenyan shillings) a month, but soon began overworking her and withholding her pay. \u201cShe [the employer] said: \u2018why should I pay you when you\u2019re eating and living here for free?\u2019,\u201d says Esther. \u201cI\u2019d get up at 3am to clean the house and get the kids ready for school and work until the family went to bed. It always felt like I\u2019d have to sneak time to rest. There are days I\u2019d work until I felt sick, but they wouldn\u2019t let me leave the house no matter how bad it got.\u201d Esther says their treatment of her was riddled with contempt. She was ordered to make separate meals for herself, often poorer in quality and less nutritious, or to prepare hers on the charcoal stove rather than gas cooker, which took twice the time and effort. Once, she was beaten with a pipe in front of house guests for a delay in serving tea, leaving her humiliated and sore all over. \u201cNobody wants to do that kind of work,\u201d says Esther. \u201cIf I had stayed in school, maybe I would not have been abused like I have been.\u201d There is no current data on the number of child domestic workers in Kenya, but domestic work is believed to be the second largest contributor to child labour in the country. A 2023 study found children as young as seven driven into work by poverty, with many facing physical abuse and denied access to their salaries. While schools are legally obliged to investigate the reasons for a child\u2019s absence, rights groups say dropout cases, especially in poorer areas, go unchecked, leaving children vulnerable to labour abuses and worsening the cycle of poverty in lower-income families. Old friends from school gradually sidelined Esther, she says, leaving her socially isolated. After the family she was working for stopped paying her completely, she fled and became homeless until an older domestic worker introduced her to a group of street men and told her she could make better money working under them. The gang operated across a handful of low-income neighbourhoods. Esther, then 15, transported drugs and weapons as girls were less likely to be suspected, arrested or shot by police. The gang bought her fancy clothes and took care of her expenses, such as food and housing, recording her work hours meticulously and promising to pay her when she left the group. She only decided to leave after two of the men in the gang were shot and another was arrested over possession of drugs and a gun. \u201cI was really scared,\u201d says Esther. \u201cThe work was becoming too dangerous, but when I asked to leave and requested my money, they told me that nobody left the gang alive.\u201d Fearing for her safety, she escaped and returned to work as a maid for a family of seven in a middle-class neighbourhood.

One day, when the family left the house, their son, who was living at home while studying at a local university, raped her. When she told his mother, she accused her of lying and beat her.

The Labour party has several senior politicians who have supported the four-day week, including the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, who last year said: \u201cIf you can deliver within a four-day working week, then why not?\u201d But since gaining power, the party has not embraced the policy, perhaps fearful of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/01/minister-orders-halt-to-cambridgeshire-councils-four-day-week-trial\">giving political ammunition to the Conservative opposition</a>.</p> <p>When more than 500 civil servants represented by the PCS union at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government signed a petition recently calling for a four-day week, a spokesperson for the department said that a four-day week \u201cis not government policy or something we are considering\u201d.</p> <p>However, businesses do not need government approval to go ahead, and the work pattern is being tested by new types of business. Georgia Pearson, the people manager at Crate Brewery, which serves craft beer on the bank of Hackney\u2019s Lee Navigation, said the trial \u201cfeels somewhat groundbreaking\u201d for the hospitality industry.</p> <p>Restaurants, pubs and bars tend to be run on relatively thin margins with workers at or near the minimum wage. However, Crate is hoping that the new working pattern will improve recruitment.</p> <p>\u201cFor operational teams, physically demanding service shifts can mean that off days are spent recuperating, rather than enjoying personal time off,\u201d Pearson said. \u201cAlthough we\u2019ve never struggled with retention, we recognise the competitive advantage that comes with being ahead of the curve with a four-day week, and we hope it will aid recruitment particularly in support office roles.\u201d</p> <p>Joe Ryle, the director of the 4 Day Week Campaign, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have to just imagine a four-day week any more, because it\u2019s already a reality for hundreds of businesses and tens of thousands of workers in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cWe look forward to presenting the results of this latest trial to the new Labour government next summer.\u201d</p>",

The Labour party has several senior politicians who have supported the four-day week, including the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, who last year said: \u201cIf you can deliver within a four-day working week, then why not?\u201d But since gaining power, the party has not embraced the policy, perhaps fearful of giving political ammunition to the Conservative opposition. When more than 500 civil servants represented by the PCS union at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government signed a petition recently calling for a four-day week, a spokesperson for the department said that a four-day week \u201cis not government policy or something we are considering\u201d. However, businesses do not need government approval to go ahead, and the work pattern is being tested by new types of business. Georgia Pearson, the people manager at Crate Brewery, which serves craft beer on the bank of Hackney\u2019s Lee Navigation, said the trial \u201cfeels somewhat groundbreaking\u201d for the hospitality industry. Restaurants, pubs and bars tend to be run on relatively thin margins with workers at or near the minimum wage. However, Crate is hoping that the new working pattern will improve recruitment. \u201cFor operational teams, physically demanding service shifts can mean that off days are spent recuperating, rather than enjoying personal time off,\u201d Pearson said. \u201cAlthough we\u2019ve never struggled with retention, we recognise the competitive advantage that comes with being ahead of the curve with a four-day week, and we hope it will aid recruitment particularly in support office roles.\u201d Joe Ryle, the director of the 4 Day Week Campaign, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have to just imagine a four-day week any more, because it\u2019s already a reality for hundreds of businesses and tens of thousands of workers in the UK. \u201cWe look forward to presenting the results of this latest trial to the new Labour government next summer.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Plenty unites the Guardian\u2019s sports reporters and cultural critics. Both make a living observing the apex of physicality. They have to make sense of what they\u2019ve seen at lightning speed to meet deadlines. So why not swap gigs for the day? The sports team were delighted to be working in warm venues; the critics unabashed about their disregard for the rules of the game. But more importantly, genuinely striking insights ensued, whether about Elton John\u2019s appearance at Dua Lipa\u2019s gig being the equivalent of Aston Villa making a Hail Mary sub of Jhon Dur\u00e1n, or the rugby ball being like a black hole sucking the players into its orbit. Perhaps we need to open transfer season between desks more often. <em>Laura Snapes</em></p> <h2>You don\u2019t get this at Exeter v Sale. Rock\u2019n\u2019roll, baby!</h2> <p><em>Becky Hill at Exeter Westpoint Arena, 18 October</em><em>, by rugby union correspondent </em><em><strong>Robert Kitson</strong></em></p>    <p>Reporting on sport and live music should be pretty similar, right? Noisy crowds, eye-catching talent, a diversion from the heavy-lifting of serious news. Hmm. This is the first time I\u2019ve turned up for work to find an angry-looking fire blazing at the venue and staff already scraping projectile vomit off the carpet in the foyer. You don\u2019t get this at Exeter v Sale. Rock\u2019n\u2019roll, baby!</p> <p>I fish out my notebook and briefly pretend to be a proper journalist. Luckily, the fire \u2013 caused by a lifting truck bursting into flames \u2013 is swiftly extinguished and the show can go on. Someone has poured heaps of absorbent spill powder on the diced carrot, which is helpful. Nothing like a sticky floor to remind you of dodgy student gigs back in the day.</p> <p>This may also be the time to start plotting an exit strategy. When Lewis Capaldi played here early last year, some punters complained of a three-hour queue to leave the car park. On the upside, at least some starrier names are now visiting Exeter. The majority turn their tour buses around at Bristol or Bournemouth, seemingly content to leave the rest of the West Country to chew straw and talk to our animals.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018Are you ready for the Afterglow, Exeter?\u2019 Hill shrieks. Eh?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That said, with the gig already under way, surprising numbers of people are still tucking into pints of cider outside. This site also plays host to the Devon county show, the annual highlight of the local agricultural calendar, and is in no imminent danger of being mistaken for the Royal Albert Hall. So fair play to Becky Hill for rising above it all. Our down-to-earth dance diva already merits our thanks.</p> <p>But no matter how local, some of us have stumbled deep into alien territory. \u201cAre you ready for the Afterglow, Exeter?\u201d Hill shrieks once we\u2019re inside. Eh? Judging by the forest of mobile phones being thrust into the air, everyone else knows her back catalogue slightly better than me.</p> <p>And, look, maybe every reviewer should be required to declare the last three gigs they have personally paid to see. Some would argue my guitar-driven trio \u2013 Billy Bragg, the War on Drugs, Del Amitri \u2013 does not ideally qualify me to pontificate on the UK dance diva\u2019s long-awaited first arena tour. \u201cHave you listened to the album?\u201d Hill asks her audience, rather plaintively, at one stage. Maybe she\u2019s spotted my phone is still in my pocket?</p> <p>The digested read? Hill seems genuinely nice, if slightly reluctant to attempt a few more dance moves \u00e0 la Dua Lipa and, potentially, elevate her show to another stratosphere. She has fabulous hair and, even in a big metal shed in deepest Devon on a damp Friday night, she can definitely sing. The crowd mostly seem to be appreciative without ever going bonkers.</p> <p>\u201cAre you ready to fucking party?\u201d implores our heroine, still seeking more energy. It is easy to see her connecting with serious clubbers on a steamy night in Ibiza. But they don\u2019t have to contend with our looming car park hell. Good luck for the rest of the tour, Becky, and mind that vomit on the way out.</p> <h2>If this were theatre, it would be a West End extravaganza</h2> <p><em>NFL: New England Patriots v Jacksonville Jaguars, Wembley Stadium, 20 October, by chief theatre critic </em><em><strong>Arifa Akbar</strong></em></p>    <p>All drama is based on conflict. Without it, there is no action or story. As a theatre critic, I know this mantra well. But it is not until I arrive at the heaving splendour of Wembley stadium for my first live NFL game that I remember it can equally be about spectacle. The opening moments contain the ceremonial splash of a state parade. Men in military-style uniforms march up to the sidelines. A massive union jack and star-spangled banner are unfurled. It is candy-floss pomp: this is not a contest of two nations and the stakes are low because neither Patriots nor Jaguars have qualified for next year\u2019s Super Bowl. But if this sublime and ridiculous pre-game scene-setting is to rouse, dazzle and distract from that fact, it does its job.</p> <p>An adrenalised Jaguar mascot bungee-jumps above the field while players run out of the mouth of a cartoon wildcat. If this were theatre, it would be a lavish West End extravaganza produced by Sonia Friedman with Netflix or Disney money behind it. It has the immaculate choreography of a musical: the cheerleaders shake their pom-poms and swoosh their hair and gather for an arrow-shaped \u201croar\u201d \u2013 a modern can-can that is as high-octane as the mascot\u2019s antics. The players crouch in runners\u2019 postures before each burst of action.</p> <p>Across three hours, the game has a staccato drama: tension comes in plosive point-scoring. It could drag were it not for the moving parts. There is a contemporaneous commodification of the live event on the screens, which flash with adverts, instructions, player closeups and recaps. Comperes juggle between commentary and entertaining the crowd with the elongated words of WWE ring announcers.</p> <p>If this is about performance, it is about the performance of masculinity, too. The players are the mythic heroes who range timelessly across the literary canon, from Arthur Miller\u2019s Biff Loman (Death of a Salesman) and Tennessee Williams\u2019 Brick (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof) to F Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s Yale football champ, Tom Buchanan, and Philip Roth\u2019s Jewish sporting hero, the Swede, who shows us that football is one way the \u201coutsider\u201d can become wholesomely all-American.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The game has the good-natured feel of a festival</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Its allure is clear to see on this field, with players who look like modern-day gladiators. Here is star quarterback Trevor Lawrence, with his Samson-like locks; Evan Engram,<strong> </strong>with tattooed sleeves that look like <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/braveheart-movies-faces-blue-paint-explained/\">William Wallace\u2019s war-paint</a>; and<strong> </strong>Parker Washington, who brings the most scintillating moment of the game with a 96-yard punt return. They are like gods in their own realm, aloof and apart from the tinsel around them. They have purity of purpose, and their defensive or offensive moves are overt displays of aggression. The crisis of masculinity increasingly explored in stories on stage is nowhere to be seen here. The old-school hero is fully intact on this field.</p> <p>I have always found the tribalism of team sports unnerving; it seems to me like a real-life conflict between <em>us</em> and <em>them</em>. As a child of immigrants, growing up in the racially hostile Britain of the 1980s, team sport seemed like proof of belonging, or otherwise, with fury on the football terraces and the definitive either/or of Norman Tebbit\u2019s cricket test. That might be an anachronism now, but it leaves a bitter aftertaste. Yet I have felt the power of this tribalism, too, rooting for the Pakistani cricket team as a way of asserting my heritage, and for Arsenal in childhood allegiance to north London.</p> <p>It is different here, though. Supporters sit among each other, many colours in one block: a man in a Lawrence jersey next to one in an Aston Villa scarf next to a group of young women dressed in animal print, in support of the Jaguars. Animosities are absent, the crowd cutting across all ages. The game does not seem as emotionally freighted as a result, but has the good-natured feel of a festival.</p> <p>The Jaguars lag for the first half, but there is a turning point and they romp to victory (32-16). I have been forewarned about NFL\u2019s arcane rules but that is no obstruction to the drama. It is like losing a grip on the plot but being carried along by the spectacle. It doesn\u2019t always have to be about conflict.</p> <h2>As a music novice, I depart pretty awestruck</h2> <p><em>Paul Weller</em><em> at O2 City Hall Newcastle, 24 October</em><em>, by </em><em>football correspondent <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></em></p>    <p>In my peculiar little world, evening work assignments in north-east England at this time of year are synonymous with the need to keep warm, and I possess the duvet coats, thermals and glove collection to prove it. Indeed, resistance to winter weather is so central to the job that a useful piece of advice for anyone contemplating a career in football reporting is to sit outside on a cold night and type on a laptop for a couple of hours.</p> <p>So, for this interloper, it is a luxury to sit in a sold-out Newcastle City Hall and listen to an impressively eclectic two-hour Paul Weller set. A normal night match, 10 minutes\u2019 walk away at Newcastle United\u2019s St James\u2019 Park, involves hitting a 10pm first-edition print deadline and requires roughly half my report to be emailed in at half-time, followed by a further chunk after 70 minutes. The introduction and payoff (the top and tail of the report) are sent at, or ideally slightly before, the final whistle. Next comes a post-match rewrite, including quotes from the managers, emphasising any news lines.</p> <p>Here, as a music novice, I am spared the need to file live and thus expose my ignorance of the nuances of woodwind, brass and baritone, and can simply enjoy a reminder of why I\u2019ve always loved the Jam and the Style Council. I\u2019m less familiar with Weller\u2019s more recent stuff but depart pretty awestruck by the depth, breadth and sheer range of his repertoire. Long before the end, my appreciation of the knowledge, not to mention writing skill, of Guardian pop critics Alexis Petridis and co has been throughly amplified.</p>    <p>A proper music writer\u2019s review would presumably mention Weller\u2019s declaration, made as he introduces the evocative Have You Ever Had It Blue, that the concert is dedicated to \u201cthe people of Gaza\u201d. This is followed by the Modfather\u2019s unequivocal description of events in that part of the Middle East as \u201ca genocide\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If a Premier League manager said what Weller does, the sports pages would be ripped apart</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If a Premier League manager said something similar \u2013 or appeared, \u00e0 la Weller, accompanied by a Palestinian flag \u2013 the sports pages would be ripped apart, and the energy invested in hammering out a story in pursuit of deadline would be enough to light up a small town. Armies of controversy-averse, brand-protecting \u201ccommunication experts\u201d strive to ensure football coaches avoid venturing into politics, but Weller\u2019s views on Gaza \u2013 endorsed, incidentally, by widespread City Hall applause \u2013 are reiterated during most of his performances these days.</p> <p>The differences with football do not end there. As an anonymous face in the crowd, I feel free to clap enthusiastically as the audience dance in the stalls. At a match this would be considered deeply unprofessional, since sportswriters are expected to maintain strict impartiality at all times. Tonight, Weller belies his 66 years by performing Shout to the Top, That\u2019s Entertainment, Town Called Malice et al with the boundless energy and verve of his 20th-century self.</p> <h2>I don\u2019t know much about football, but I\u2019m totally gripped</h2> <p><em>Brighton v Wolves at Amex stadium, Brighton, 26 October</em><em>, by chief rock and pop critic </em><em><strong>Alexis Petridis</strong></em></p>    <p>I did not grow up in a big football family. My dad wasn\u2019t around much, and he didn\u2019t seem particularly interested in football anyway. My uncle was, to the extent that he even ended up working for his local team, but his local team was Panionios, in south Athens, and we lived in Yorkshire, so his enthusiasm wasn\u2019t going to exert much influence on me. I dimly recall being taken to a Sunderland game by a relation, but the details of why and when are lost to me. I can remember seeing a really pissed bloke slumped on the pavement outside Roker Park, singing Lip Up Fatty by Bad Manners at the top of his voice, which I guess dates it to the early 80s, but that\u2019s about it: it clearly didn\u2019t make much of an impression.</p> <p>So I take my seat at the Amex stadium with a certain hangdog air. I\u2019m sitting next to Guardian reporter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-brewin\">John Brewin</a> \u2013 who looks aghast when I tell him I don\u2019t really know much about football and am expecting to be bored. But I\u2019m really not, to a degree that startles me. I\u2019m wary of stating the obvious here, but watching a game in person is a completely different experience from watching it on TV. I can somehow see what\u2019s going on better. It brings a visceral clarity I\u2019ve never experienced before: there\u2019s something about witnessing first-hand the sheer speed of Brighton midfielder Kaoru Mitoma when he gets the ball, or the cool slickness of Danny Welbeck\u2019s finish as he scores the first goal \u2013 he gives off the air of someone sticking a letter in a postbox \u2013 that I find completely involving.</p> <p>It helps that it is an exciting game. It\u2019s supposedly a foregone conclusion. \u201cThe story is that Wolves are crap at the moment and Brighton have this wunderkind new manager, [Fabian] H\u00fcrzeler,\u201d John tells me; even before the wunderkind rocked up, the last time they met, Brighton were 4-0 up within 55 minutes. But it doesn\u2019t turn out like that at all. Initially, everything seems to be proceeding as expected. Brighton dominate the first half, culminating in Welbeck\u2019s goal, although, with the benefit of hindsight, the number of chances they fail to put away before that should have indicated that things weren\u2019t quite as cut and dried as assumed.</p> <p>Wolves are better in the second half \u2013 even I can tell they are playing with more attack after a couple of substitutions \u2013 although a goal by Evan Ferguson seems to seal the game. But you can\u2019t fault Wolves\u2019 tenacity: they just keep plugging away. Rayan A\u00eft-Nouri scores almost immediately after Ferguson, then a disastrous pass by Mats Wieffer \u2013 at precisely the point it looks like Brighton are about to score a third \u2013 sends Wolves surging forward again in the 93rd minute, handing them an equaliser.</p> <p>Leaving the ground, I hear people talking about the frustrating lack of cohesion in Brighton\u2019s playing, which they suggest is down to the absence of injured captain Lewis Dunk. I wouldn\u2019t know. What I do know is that I\u2019ve been completely gripped by something I\u2019ve never been gripped by before. I couldn\u2019t be more pleasantly surprised.</p> <h2>Opera is absurd \u2013 and very long</h2> <p><em>The Turn of the Screw, Coliseum, London, 29 October</em><em>, by chief sports writer </em><em><strong>Barney Ronay</strong></em></p>    <p><em>We need an idiot</em>. To be fair, the editorial steer on this assignment, sending a career sports hack to the opera, was a bit more nuanced than this. Just take it as it comes. Don\u2019t feign expertise. Just be yourself. Describing physical performance is what we do all the time in sport. I have reported on thousands of live events over the last 20 years. I\u2019ve seen Andrea Bocelli serenade Leicester City\u2019s Premier League title celebrations, which was good and also didn\u2019t last very long. I have looked on vaguely as an endless scroll of operatic singers belt out national anthems in echoey new-build stadiums.</p> <p>But I had never been to the opera, or wanted to. I can see the performers are hypertalented voice athletes, expressing through this highly formalised medium a genuinely wild emotional register, which isn\u2019t too far off the kind of thing sport tries to do in its best moments. But the prospect of having to sit through what could be any number of hours (four? seven?) while people sing a story at each other has always seemed objectively painful to me. </p> <p>Sport reporting can often be a formulaic, zero-sum affair. As the crowd begins to filter into the Coliseum theatre\u2019s lovely soft beige and brown interior, it is hard to avoid some familiar pre-performance thoughts. Who is going to <em>win</em> the opera? Should the ENO team try to <em>get the crowd involved early on</em>? There was talk pre-curtain of a novice conductor making her full debut here. Would Charlotte Corderoy do the basics well, settle in, and just look to find her feet at this level?</p> <p>There are two things worth saying straight away. Opera is, as expected, absurd on a very basic level. This not a bad thing. Lots of hard, interesting, endlessly refined cultural activities have this quality. Cricket is absurd. The 100m hurdles is absurd. Opera is at least instantly and unapologetically absurd.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It turns out that the worst part of going to the opera is the opening second</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It turns out that the worst part of going to the opera is the opening second, when the curtain goes up and a man immediately starts singing his thoughts, at which point you realise this is just going to keep happening for a really, really long time. Everyone is going to sing all of their thoughts to everyone else all of the time. The German man who seemed to spend most of Euro 2024 outside Essen train station shouting every single one of his thoughts at passersby could walk on stage here and the audience would simply nod and say: \u201cHmm, interesting exposition.\u201d</p> <p>The big thing about Benjamin Britten is that the libretto is in English, so you can at least understand the dialogue. This doesn\u2019t necessarily help. Before long people are singing things like \u201cYou must be Mrs Grose\u201d and \u201cWho is at the door?\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s my desk\u201d. No shit.</p> <p>Happily, the necessary suspension of disbelief kicks in. There are thrilling and quite scary solos. The way the music drives the drama from one part to the next is absorbing. The visuals are great, in particular the projection of moving images on to a grimly portentous architectural set. There is still zero humour, not even \u201ctheatre humour\u201d where people laugh in braying tones to show they understand Shakespeare\u2019s puns. But this is probably for the best. Because the second thing worth saying is that this is a drama about child abuse.</p>    <p>That was Britten\u2019s interpretation of Henry James\u2019s original novel, positioning this element right out in front as the key narrative peg. What you get is a show that graphically represents the grooming and sexual abuse of children and adults, while telling you in its tone and phrasing that this is simply a richly textured gothic horror.</p> <p>Britten\u2019s opera focuses its gothic energy entirely on the physical and emotional abuse of Miles, a pre-pubescent boy, by the deceased paedophile valet, who also abused anyone else in his eyeline, and who is still present in ghost form grooming his charge. Basically this is Jimmy Savile with songs. The problem is these things are presented without nuance or depth. It\u2019s all painfully prosaic. We literally watch a child being seduced by a paedophile, who strokes his face and looms in close over him. We see an onstage rape, which is, yep, definitely nasty.</p> <p>No doubt it would be possible to sound intelligent by saying this is all very difficult and challenging. But it lacks any really vivid signifiers as to what it\u2019s wider meaning is supposed to be. To suggest, as James perhaps does too, that the entire drama might be taking place in the mind of an unstable female (Women! What are they like?!) isn\u2019t complex or a brilliant literary device; it\u2019s just exculpatory shittiness.By the end, it seems odd that this piece of art is still being performed at all, that we can\u2019t simply have something new. Gen Z, if they ever get to the opera, aren\u2019t going to put up with this. I would even advise people to avoid seeing it if they have come into contact with this kind of trauma in their own lives, as it has nothing to say that will make any kind of sense out of this.</p> <p>No doubt there are many who will disagree with the thrust of this review, will see it as bleating wokery, cancel culture. It isn\u2019t really. You can generally separate the artist and the art. You could make the case that all we have here is a drama about the mystical power of children or some such. But it doesn\u2019t feel like that. Sometimes, if something makes you feel creeped out, that\u2019s just because it\u2019s creepy.</p> <h2>It reminded me of rummaging in my bag for my keys</h2> <p><em>Saracens women v Gloucester-Hartpury, StoneX Stadium, London, 27 October,</em><em> by dance critic </em><em><strong>Lyndsey Winship</strong></em></p>    <p>Broad daylight is not the natural milieu of a dance critic, but here we are pitch-side, taking notes on a fourth round premiership clash between Saracens Women and Gloucester-Hartpury. I\u2019ve never watched a rugby match before, and to the outsider, this game, with its hookers and blindside flankers, sounds like some sort of quidditch. But what I saw was 80 minutes of brief dramas, flashes of grace and a frustrating amount of stop-start stasis.</p> <p>Coming from theatre, I found myself yearning for flow. Every few minutes the play stops, a ball goes out or a medic comes on, and there\u2019s a blast of Kaiser Chiefs to fill the gap, or the announcer plugging an upcoming fireworks display. But sometimes you get this beautiful cascading momentum, bodies chasing the ball and chasing each other: a pass, a trip, a roll, a recovery, another run, in seamless motion \u2013 until interrupted by a storming tackle.</p> <p>As someone who deciphers bodies for a living, I enjoyed the intended, and unintended, choreography on the pitch. The set pieces, the line-outs especially \u2013 the adrenalised patter of quick-stepping feet, the surge as a jumper is lifted, soaring upward ramrod straight, stretching out arms and time (just for a millisecond) before being swallowed back into the team. But also the murmurations of the players, waves of Saracens\u2019 black shirts like a tide ebbing westwards, as pink-clad Gloucester-Hartpury pushed them away from their goal, taking an early lead; the way the ball is like a mini black hole, sucking everything towards it, a tight cluster at the centre, but also a swirling galaxy of players moored to its gravity. The interlaced bodies of the scrum could be almost a constructivist choreography \u00e0 la Bronislava Nijinska, or sometimes just a clumsy scramble of bums and thighs. Also, in the way you can\u2019t really see what\u2019s going on, it reminded me of exasperatedly rummaging in your bag for lost keys.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The interlaced bodies of the scrum could be almost a constructivist choreography \u00e0 la Bronislava Nijinska</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The game\u2019s fortunes shift constantly, like this sport\u2019s seemingly ever-changing balance between collective strength and plucky individuals. Gloucester-Hartpury are 12 points up; the pendulum swings with a try from Saracens\u2019 Bryony Field; Gabby Senft scores another; then Saracens lead by nine, but by half-time they\u2019re 12 points down. In a stadium fit for 10,000, a crowd a 10th of that size for this women\u2019s game feels sparse. You need the audience for drama to come alive. It\u2019s not until there are 10 minutes to go and the home team is 35-38 down that survival instinct seems to kick in, on and off pitch, and the slider goes up on the supporters\u2019 noise level.</p> <p>The game is like this \u2013 a lull of energy, a seeming stalemate, and then all of a sudden everything\u2019s at stake, life or death. A runner breaks free: \u201cGo hard! Go hard!\u201d a teammate shouts. Last season\u2019s champions Gloucester-Hartpury had not had two successive defeats this season until now. At the final gong, Saracens win 49-38, and I have found unexpected beauty amid the brute strength.</p> <h2>A bit like when the home team wins a corner</h2> <p><em>Dua Lipa</em><em> at the Royal Albert Hall, London, 17 October</em><em>, by sports writer </em><em><strong>Jonathan Liew</strong></em></p>    <p>This is actually the second time I\u2019ve seen Dua Lipa. Six years ago, she was the pre-match entertainment at the Champions League final in Kyiv, and let\u2019s just say that that is a gig that comes with challenges. Nobody is there to see you. The space is vast, the sound system largely designed for safety announcements. Lipa\u2019s voice \u2013 sweet but fragile \u2013 died somewhere around the edge of the penalty area. Several of my colleagues didn\u2019t even look up from their laptops.</p> <p>In a way, this has been a recurring motif of Lipa\u2019s live career: a kind of roaming existence, constant away fixtures, the search for a constituency. Big stadiums seem to flatten her a bit. Glastonbury this summer didn\u2019t quite work. How do you generate devotion when your whole shtick is a kind of arch detachment? What is your natural habitat when you\u2019re a star of the pandemic?</p> <p>Which brings us to a warm and shimmering Albert Hall and this made-for-TV special. This is Dua as Serious Artist: one night only, a pitch for scarcity over volume, even a kind of anti-Eras vibe. Go girl, give us a 53-piece orchestra, every single track off Radical Optimism, your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/may/03/dua-lipa-radical-optimism-review-psychedelic-pop-infused-pull-the-other-one\">radically mid new album</a> \u2013 no One Kiss, no New Rules. Give us a Gaultier dress and gloves that go up to your biceps.</p> <p>A serpentine walkway cuts a swoosh across the stage, somehow allowing her to walk towards you and away from you at the same time: classic Dua, beckoning you in with one hand and pushing you away with the other. The show sags about a quarter of the way in and again three-quarters in, and by absolutely no coincidence these are the most Radical Optimism-heavy parts.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A piece of advice, Dua: there comes a point where you have to give up on being taken seriously</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some of the ornamentation works well \u2013 French Exit gets a nifty jazz-club reboot \u2013 but for all the bells and whistles, these are songs that really weren\u2019t strong enough in the first place. The effect is somewhere between an extremely polished cruise ship performance and that bit in a football game when the home team wins a corner and everyone reluctantly stands up.</p> <p>Naturally, there is an insoluble problem here. Dua longs to contain multitudes, to be one of those rounded, versatile, shape-shifting modern pop stars capable of being all things to all people. You see it in her brand endorsements and her book club, her piecemeal forays into activism. But, ultimately, she has only ever really served one purpose: songs about dancing for people who really, really want to dance.</p> <p>And in this vocation, she remains unmatched by anyone on the planet. Houdini and Levitating at the start. Dance the Night and Don\u2019t Start Now to finish, the climax of a breathtaking encore in which Elton John is winched on stage with all the audacity and flourish of Aston Villa throwing on Jhon Duran as an 85th-minute substitute.</p> <p>A piece of advice, from someone who once dreamed of writing generation-defining novels and now types jokes about football for the Guardian: there comes a point where you have to give up on being taken seriously. Sure, do the Albert Hall for the cachet. Add some strings to Houdini if you think it will impress people. But in the end, lean hard into the stuff people actually want. Which is songs about shit men and dancing so hard you stop crying. Because this stuff is going to be your ticket to immortality. Nail it and your natural habitat will be anywhere with a speaker, your natural constituency anybody with ears and toes to tap.</p> <h2>I feel as if I\u2019m on the Starship Enterprise</h2> <p><em>England v Germany</em><em> at Wembley Stadium, London, 25 October</em><em>, by classical music critic </em><em><strong>Flora Willson</strong></em></p>    <p>\u201cYou know where you\u2019re going, don\u2019t you?\u201d says the woman who hands over my press pass. I mumble apologetically. Does it count as impostor syndrome if you\u2019re an actual impostor? They surely don\u2019t get many Wembley first-timers at the media entrance. Or many classical music critics. But here I am, FA-accredited and clueless, for a women\u2019s international friendly.</p> <p>I\u2019ve already run the gamut of girls in tinsel-edged England cowboy hats, groups taking selfies, burger vans, merch stands, lines of stewards and police. Loudspeakers bark instructions like a PE teacher turned dictator. Vast screens pulse constantly. Compared with most classical music venues, Wembley feels like the Starship Enterprise.</p> <p>Inside, the media suite is already full of people typing frantically. After years of indecipherable scribbling in darkened auditoriums, I hadn\u2019t considered bringing my laptop. But it\u2019s obviously not the main thing I lack. \u201cDo you know what formation they play?\u201d one journalist asks his colleague. \u201cI\u2019d probably go 4-2-1-3,\u201d she replies. I try not to panic. I don\u2019t know which team they mean. I couldn\u2019t distinguish 4-2-1-3 from any other formation. And no, I can\u2019t explain the offside rule.</p> <p>I head outside in search of atmosphere \u2013 more familiar territory \u2013 and find an array of industrial sprinklers watering the pitch. Nothing much happens. But suddenly the lights go down, thousands of phone lights twinkle and there are fireworks, pounding drum\u2019n\u2019bass and roaring from the crowd as an enormous England crest is unfurled. Then a fidgety hush.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I miss the start of the match while trying to spot the brass band I can hear</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After that, the match starts abruptly. I miss it while trying to spot the brass band I can hear. Idiot music critic, I hear you cry! But missing the vital stuff is horribly easy. Everything happens at astonishing speed, players moving in clusters of whirling legs and breakneck turns, numbers on shirts barely legible. My respect for sports journalists \u2013 writing as they watch the melee, filing as the whistle blows \u2013 reaches a new high.</p> <p>I catch Germany scoring their first goal two minutes in but don\u2019t see what earned a Lioness a yellow card soon after. An England goal generates a deafening response but is disallowed for reasons I can\u2019t fathom. By half-time, the score is 3-2 to Germany. \u201cThis is <em>insane</em>,\u201d mutters one of the real reporters.</p> <p>In the second half, things slow down. A squadron of paper planes floats past, thrown by bored kids in the upper stands. A guy nearby works his way through a massive cup of jellybeans. There are substitutions, near-misses, occasional goals. At one point Germany\u2019s coach waves his arms furiously from the sidelines. As far as I can tell, no one takes any notice. The big screen informs us there are 47,967 people there \u2013 just over 50% capacity. Some are already leaving.</p> <p>And then it\u2019s over: 4-3 to Germany. Downstairs, a sad-looking man in a cardigan presides silently over the press conference room. \u201cWe had too many unforced errors,\u201d concedes the Lionesses\u2019 coach, Sarina Wiegman. By the time I emerge, the crowd has gone. The stadium rings with the low buzz of six lawnmowers, its hallowed pitch now just so much grass.</p> <h2>A dark tale \u2013 so dark, it\u2019s hard to take notes</h2> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/nov/03/lizzie-review-rock-opera-southwark-playhouse-elephant-london\">Lizzie the Musical</a></em><em> at Hope Mill Theatre, Manchester</em><em>, </em><em>ends 17 November</em><em>, by sports writer </em><em><strong>Tanya Aldred</strong></em></p>    <p>As a cricket reporter, going to work without having to wear an anorak is a good start. The unfamiliarity of this new experience continues in the warmth of Hope Mill\u2019s snug bar, decorated with fairy lights, rugs, chandeliers and old red velvet theatre seats with just the right amount of sag. Those gathered for a pre-show drink are definitely more female than your average County Championship crowd \u2013 though, as at the cricket, a handful sit comfortably alone with only a (very nice) coffee for company.</p> <p>We\u2019re all here for Lizzie the Musical, based on the true story of Lizzie Borden, who was tried for \u2013 and acquitted of \u2013 the murder of her father and stepmother in 1892. The Massachusetts public \u2013 in fact, the wider US \u2013 couldn\u2019t get enough of the scandal. It ticked every titillating box that a burgeoning mass media could blow out: a bloody axe; respectable, if repellent victims; a society spinster suspect; a burnt dress.</p> <p>Fascination with the story has been long-lasting. This show premiered in New York in 2009, and is back in Manchester after a sellout run at Hope Mill last summer. A four-woman cast, fuelled by an electric all-woman band, belt through the murderous buildup and the subsequent court case, with a succession of furious tunes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The high-energy finale matches the glory of a tight last-over finish</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>All four leads hold the stage with gumption, even during the less catchy numbers: the beguiling Katie Tonkinson as meek neighbour Alice, hopelessly in love with Lizzie; Emilie Louise Israel as sharp older sister Emma; and Kayleigh McKnight in the title role, seamlessly switching from heavy sorrow to righteous fury. But the standout turn is Eve Kitchingman as Bridget, the Borden family maid. Performing the part for the first time, as a stand-in for Jennifer Caldwell, she lets emotions peel across her face, a roll of the eye here, a purse of the lips there \u2013 the all-knowing observer of the piece.</p> <p>The seats rise rustically, and steeply, from almost the lip of the stage, in the manner of Old Trafford\u2019s party stand. The intimacy of the venue works particularly well for such a visceral production (though I haven\u2019t worked out how to take notes in the dark). This is complemented by a simple set that makes the most of the industrial beams latticing the ceiling, filling them with doves who will meet a nasty end, while projections are beamed on to the screen. The choreography is thoughtful \u2013 I love the scene set around the coffee pot \u2013 and the long skirts and low-slung belts are worn with riot grrrl attitude.</p> <p>Watching a musical about a double murder \u2013 even if the grisly bits happen offstage \u2013 and listening to lyrics about incest (the desperately sad This Is Not Love) raises more complex emotions than is usual on day two of Derbyshire v Glamorgan. But the high-energy finale matches the glory of a tight last-over finish, only with no statistics to comb through afterwards and no danger of rain stopping play.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Plenty unites the Guardian\u2019s sports reporters and cultural critics. Both make a living observing the apex of physicality. They have to make sense of what they\u2019ve seen at lightning speed to meet deadlines. So why not swap gigs for the day? The sports team were delighted to be working in warm venues; the critics unabashed about their disregard for the rules of the game. But more importantly, genuinely striking insights ensued, whether about Elton John\u2019s appearance at Dua Lipa\u2019s gig being the equivalent of Aston Villa making a Hail Mary sub of Jhon Dur\u00e1n, or the rugby ball being like a black hole sucking the players into its orbit. Perhaps we need to open transfer season between desks more often. Laura Snapes You don\u2019t get this at Exeter v Sale. Rock\u2019n\u2019roll, baby! Becky Hill at Exeter Westpoint Arena, 18 October, by rugby union correspondent Robert Kitson Reporting on sport and live music should be pretty similar, right? Noisy crowds, eye-catching talent, a diversion from the heavy-lifting of serious news. Hmm. This is the first time I\u2019ve turned up for work to find an angry-looking fire blazing at the venue and staff already scraping projectile vomit off the carpet in the foyer. You don\u2019t get this at Exeter v Sale. Rock\u2019n\u2019roll, baby! I fish out my notebook and briefly pretend to be a proper journalist. Luckily, the fire \u2013 caused by a lifting truck bursting into flames \u2013 is swiftly extinguished and the show can go on. Someone has poured heaps of absorbent spill powder on the diced carrot, which is helpful. Nothing like a sticky floor to remind you of dodgy student gigs back in the day. This may also be the time to start plotting an exit strategy. When Lewis Capaldi played here early last year, some punters complained of a three-hour queue to leave the car park. On the upside, at least some starrier names are now visiting Exeter. The majority turn their tour buses around at Bristol or Bournemouth, seemingly content to leave the rest of the West Country to chew straw and talk to our animals. That said, with the gig already under way, surprising numbers of people are still tucking into pints of cider outside. This site also plays host to the Devon county show, the annual highlight of the local agricultural calendar, and is in no imminent danger of being mistaken for the Royal Albert Hall. So fair play to Becky Hill for rising above it all. Our down-to-earth dance diva already merits our thanks. But no matter how local, some of us have stumbled deep into alien territory. \u201cAre you ready for the Afterglow, Exeter?\u201d Hill shrieks once we\u2019re inside. Eh? Judging by the forest of mobile phones being thrust into the air, everyone else knows her back catalogue slightly better than me. And, look, maybe every reviewer should be required to declare the last three gigs they have personally paid to see. Some would argue my guitar-driven trio \u2013 Billy Bragg, the War on Drugs, Del Amitri \u2013 does not ideally qualify me to pontificate on the UK dance diva\u2019s long-awaited first arena tour. \u201cHave you listened to the album?\u201d Hill asks her audience, rather plaintively, at one stage. Maybe she\u2019s spotted my phone is still in my pocket? The digested read? Hill seems genuinely nice, if slightly reluctant to attempt a few more dance moves \u00e0 la Dua Lipa and, potentially, elevate her show to another stratosphere. She has fabulous hair and, even in a big metal shed in deepest Devon on a damp Friday night, she can definitely sing. The crowd mostly seem to be appreciative without ever going bonkers. \u201cAre you ready to fucking party?\u201d implores our heroine, still seeking more energy. It is easy to see her connecting with serious clubbers on a steamy night in Ibiza. But they don\u2019t have to contend with our looming car park hell. Good luck for the rest of the tour, Becky, and mind that vomit on the way out. If this were theatre, it would be a West End extravaganza NFL: New England Patriots v Jacksonville Jaguars, Wembley Stadium, 20 October, by chief theatre critic Arifa Akbar All drama is based on conflict. Without it, there is no action or story. As a theatre critic, I know this mantra well. But it is not until I arrive at the heaving splendour of Wembley stadium for my first live NFL game that I remember it can equally be about spectacle. The opening moments contain the ceremonial splash of a state parade. Men in military-style uniforms march up to the sidelines. A massive union jack and star-spangled banner are unfurled. It is candy-floss pomp: this is not a contest of two nations and the stakes are low because neither Patriots nor Jaguars have qualified for next year\u2019s Super Bowl. But if this sublime and ridiculous pre-game scene-setting is to rouse, dazzle and distract from that fact, it does its job. An adrenalised Jaguar mascot bungee-jumps above the field while players run out of the mouth of a cartoon wildcat. If this were theatre, it would be a lavish West End extravaganza produced by Sonia Friedman with Netflix or Disney money behind it. It has the immaculate choreography of a musical: the cheerleaders shake their pom-poms and swoosh their hair and gather for an arrow-shaped \u201croar\u201d \u2013 a modern can-can that is as high-octane as the mascot\u2019s antics. The players crouch in runners\u2019 postures before each burst of action. Across three hours, the game has a staccato drama: tension comes in plosive point-scoring. It could drag were it not for the moving parts. There is a contemporaneous commodification of the live event on the screens, which flash with adverts, instructions, player closeups and recaps. Comperes juggle between commentary and entertaining the crowd with the elongated words of WWE ring announcers. If this is about performance, it is about the performance of masculinity, too. The players are the mythic heroes who range timelessly across the literary canon, from Arthur Miller\u2019s Biff Loman (Death of a Salesman) and Tennessee Williams\u2019 Brick (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof) to F Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s Yale football champ, Tom Buchanan, and Philip Roth\u2019s Jewish sporting hero, the Swede, who shows us that football is one way the \u201coutsider\u201d can become wholesomely all-American. Its allure is clear to see on this field, with players who look like modern-day gladiators. Here is star quarterback Trevor Lawrence, with his Samson-like locks; Evan Engram, with tattooed sleeves that look like William Wallace\u2019s war-paint; and Parker Washington, who brings the most scintillating moment of the game with a 96-yard punt return. They are like gods in their own realm, aloof and apart from the tinsel around them. They have purity of purpose, and their defensive or offensive moves are overt displays of aggression. The crisis of masculinity increasingly explored in stories on stage is nowhere to be seen here. The old-school hero is fully intact on this field. I have always found the tribalism of team sports unnerving; it seems to me like a real-life conflict between us and them. As a child of immigrants, growing up in the racially hostile Britain of the 1980s, team sport seemed like proof of belonging, or otherwise, with fury on the football terraces and the definitive either/or of Norman Tebbit\u2019s cricket test. That might be an anachronism now, but it leaves a bitter aftertaste. Yet I have felt the power of this tribalism, too, rooting for the Pakistani cricket team as a way of asserting my heritage, and for Arsenal in childhood allegiance to north London. It is different here, though. Supporters sit among each other, many colours in one block: a man in a Lawrence jersey next to one in an Aston Villa scarf next to a group of young women dressed in animal print, in support of the Jaguars. Animosities are absent, the crowd cutting across all ages. The game does not seem as emotionally freighted as a result, but has the good-natured feel of a festival. The Jaguars lag for the first half, but there is a turning point and they romp to victory (32-16). I have been forewarned about NFL\u2019s arcane rules but that is no obstruction to the drama. It is like losing a grip on the plot but being carried along by the spectacle. It doesn\u2019t always have to be about conflict. As a music novice, I depart pretty awestruck Paul Weller at O2 City Hall Newcastle, 24 October, by football correspondent Louise Taylor In my peculiar little world, evening work assignments in north-east England at this time of year are synonymous with the need to keep warm, and I possess the duvet coats, thermals and glove collection to prove it. Indeed, resistance to winter weather is so central to the job that a useful piece of advice for anyone contemplating a career in football reporting is to sit outside on a cold night and type on a laptop for a couple of hours. So, for this interloper, it is a luxury to sit in a sold-out Newcastle City Hall and listen to an impressively eclectic two-hour Paul Weller set. A normal night match, 10 minutes\u2019 walk away at Newcastle United\u2019s St James\u2019 Park, involves hitting a 10pm first-edition print deadline and requires roughly half my report to be emailed in at half-time, followed by a further chunk after 70 minutes. The introduction and payoff (the top and tail of the report) are sent at, or ideally slightly before, the final whistle. Next comes a post-match rewrite, including quotes from the managers, emphasising any news lines. Here, as a music novice, I am spared the need to file live and thus expose my ignorance of the nuances of woodwind, brass and baritone, and can simply enjoy a reminder of why I\u2019ve always loved the Jam and the Style Council. I\u2019m less familiar with Weller\u2019s more recent stuff but depart pretty awestruck by the depth, breadth and sheer range of his repertoire. Long before the end, my appreciation of the knowledge, not to mention writing skill, of Guardian pop critics Alexis Petridis and co has been throughly amplified. A proper music writer\u2019s review would presumably mention Weller\u2019s declaration, made as he introduces the evocative Have You Ever Had It Blue, that the concert is dedicated to \u201cthe people of Gaza\u201d. This is followed by the Modfather\u2019s unequivocal description of events in that part of the Middle East as \u201ca genocide\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d. If a Premier League manager said something similar \u2013 or appeared, \u00e0 la Weller, accompanied by a Palestinian flag \u2013 the sports pages would be ripped apart, and the energy invested in hammering out a story in pursuit of deadline would be enough to light up a small town. Armies of controversy-averse, brand-protecting \u201ccommunication experts\u201d strive to ensure football coaches avoid venturing into politics, but Weller\u2019s views on Gaza \u2013 endorsed, incidentally, by widespread City Hall applause \u2013 are reiterated during most of his performances these days. The differences with football do not end there. As an anonymous face in the crowd, I feel free to clap enthusiastically as the audience dance in the stalls. At a match this would be considered deeply unprofessional, since sportswriters are expected to maintain strict impartiality at all times. Tonight, Weller belies his 66 years by performing Shout to the Top, That\u2019s Entertainment, Town Called Malice et al with the boundless energy and verve of his 20th-century self. I don\u2019t know much about football, but I\u2019m totally gripped Brighton v Wolves at Amex stadium, Brighton, 26 October, by chief rock and pop critic Alexis Petridis I did not grow up in a big football family. My dad wasn\u2019t around much, and he didn\u2019t seem particularly interested in football anyway. My uncle was, to the extent that he even ended up working for his local team, but his local team was Panionios, in south Athens, and we lived in Yorkshire, so his enthusiasm wasn\u2019t going to exert much influence on me. I dimly recall being taken to a Sunderland game by a relation, but the details of why and when are lost to me. I can remember seeing a really pissed bloke slumped on the pavement outside Roker Park, singing Lip Up Fatty by Bad Manners at the top of his voice, which I guess dates it to the early 80s, but that\u2019s about it: it clearly didn\u2019t make much of an impression. So I take my seat at the Amex stadium with a certain hangdog air. I\u2019m sitting next to Guardian reporter John Brewin \u2013 who looks aghast when I tell him I don\u2019t really know much about football and am expecting to be bored. But I\u2019m really not, to a degree that startles me. I\u2019m wary of stating the obvious here, but watching a game in person is a completely different experience from watching it on TV. I can somehow see what\u2019s going on better. It brings a visceral clarity I\u2019ve never experienced before: there\u2019s something about witnessing first-hand the sheer speed of Brighton midfielder Kaoru Mitoma when he gets the ball, or the cool slickness of Danny Welbeck\u2019s finish as he scores the first goal \u2013 he gives off the air of someone sticking a letter in a postbox \u2013 that I find completely involving. It helps that it is an exciting game. It\u2019s supposedly a foregone conclusion. \u201cThe story is that Wolves are crap at the moment and Brighton have this wunderkind new manager, [Fabian] H\u00fcrzeler,\u201d John tells me; even before the wunderkind rocked up, the last time they met, Brighton were 4-0 up within 55 minutes. But it doesn\u2019t turn out like that at all. Initially, everything seems to be proceeding as expected. Brighton dominate the first half, culminating in Welbeck\u2019s goal, although, with the benefit of hindsight, the number of chances they fail to put away before that should have indicated that things weren\u2019t quite as cut and dried as assumed. Wolves are better in the second half \u2013 even I can tell they are playing with more attack after a couple of substitutions \u2013 although a goal by Evan Ferguson seems to seal the game. But you can\u2019t fault Wolves\u2019 tenacity: they just keep plugging away. Rayan A\u00eft-Nouri scores almost immediately after Ferguson, then a disastrous pass by Mats Wieffer \u2013 at precisely the point it looks like Brighton are about to score a third \u2013 sends Wolves surging forward again in the 93rd minute, handing them an equaliser. Leaving the ground, I hear people talking about the frustrating lack of cohesion in Brighton\u2019s playing, which they suggest is down to the absence of injured captain Lewis Dunk. I wouldn\u2019t know. What I do know is that I\u2019ve been completely gripped by something I\u2019ve never been gripped by before. I couldn\u2019t be more pleasantly surprised. Opera is absurd \u2013 and very long The Turn of the Screw, Coliseum, London, 29 October, by chief sports writer Barney Ronay We need an idiot. To be fair, the editorial steer on this assignment, sending a career sports hack to the opera, was a bit more nuanced than this. Just take it as it comes. Don\u2019t feign expertise. Just be yourself. Describing physical performance is what we do all the time in sport. I have reported on thousands of live events over the last 20 years. I\u2019ve seen Andrea Bocelli serenade Leicester City\u2019s Premier League title celebrations, which was good and also didn\u2019t last very long. I have looked on vaguely as an endless scroll of operatic singers belt out national anthems in echoey new-build stadiums. But I had never been to the opera, or wanted to. I can see the performers are hypertalented voice athletes, expressing through this highly formalised medium a genuinely wild emotional register, which isn\u2019t too far off the kind of thing sport tries to do in its best moments. But the prospect of having to sit through what could be any number of hours (four? seven?) while people sing a story at each other has always seemed objectively painful to me. Sport reporting can often be a formulaic, zero-sum affair. As the crowd begins to filter into the Coliseum theatre\u2019s lovely soft beige and brown interior, it is hard to avoid some familiar pre-performance thoughts. Who is going to win the opera? Should the ENO team try to get the crowd involved early on? There was talk pre-curtain of a novice conductor making her full debut here. Would Charlotte Corderoy do the basics well, settle in, and just look to find her feet at this level? There are two things worth saying straight away. Opera is, as expected, absurd on a very basic level. This not a bad thing. Lots of hard, interesting, endlessly refined cultural activities have this quality. Cricket is absurd. The 100m hurdles is absurd. Opera is at least instantly and unapologetically absurd. It turns out that the worst part of going to the opera is the opening second, when the curtain goes up and a man immediately starts singing his thoughts, at which point you realise this is just going to keep happening for a really, really long time. Everyone is going to sing all of their thoughts to everyone else all of the time. The German man who seemed to spend most of Euro 2024 outside Essen train station shouting every single one of his thoughts at passersby could walk on stage here and the audience would simply nod and say: \u201cHmm, interesting exposition.\u201d The big thing about Benjamin Britten is that the libretto is in English, so you can at least understand the dialogue. This doesn\u2019t necessarily help. Before long people are singing things like \u201cYou must be Mrs Grose\u201d and \u201cWho is at the door?\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s my desk\u201d. No shit. Happily, the necessary suspension of disbelief kicks in. There are thrilling and quite scary solos. The way the music drives the drama from one part to the next is absorbing. The visuals are great, in particular the projection of moving images on to a grimly portentous architectural set. There is still zero humour, not even \u201ctheatre humour\u201d where people laugh in braying tones to show they understand Shakespeare\u2019s puns. But this is probably for the best. Because the second thing worth saying is that this is a drama about child abuse. That was Britten\u2019s interpretation of Henry James\u2019s original novel, positioning this element right out in front as the key narrative peg. What you get is a show that graphically represents the grooming and sexual abuse of children and adults, while telling you in its tone and phrasing that this is simply a richly textured gothic horror. Britten\u2019s opera focuses its gothic energy entirely on the physical and emotional abuse of Miles, a pre-pubescent boy, by the deceased paedophile valet, who also abused anyone else in his eyeline, and who is still present in ghost form grooming his charge. Basically this is Jimmy Savile with songs. The problem is these things are presented without nuance or depth. It\u2019s all painfully prosaic. We literally watch a child being seduced by a paedophile, who strokes his face and looms in close over him. We see an onstage rape, which is, yep, definitely nasty. No doubt it would be possible to sound intelligent by saying this is all very difficult and challenging. But it lacks any really vivid signifiers as to what it\u2019s wider meaning is supposed to be. To suggest, as James perhaps does too, that the entire drama might be taking place in the mind of an unstable female (Women! What are they like?!) isn\u2019t complex or a brilliant literary device; it\u2019s just exculpatory shittiness.By the end, it seems odd that this piece of art is still being performed at all, that we can\u2019t simply have something new. Gen Z, if they ever get to the opera, aren\u2019t going to put up with this. I would even advise people to avoid seeing it if they have come into contact with this kind of trauma in their own lives, as it has nothing to say that will make any kind of sense out of this. No doubt there are many who will disagree with the thrust of this review, will see it as bleating wokery, cancel culture. It isn\u2019t really. You can generally separate the artist and the art. You could make the case that all we have here is a drama about the mystical power of children or some such. But it doesn\u2019t feel like that. Sometimes, if something makes you feel creeped out, that\u2019s just because it\u2019s creepy. It reminded me of rummaging in my bag for my keys Saracens women v Gloucester-Hartpury, StoneX Stadium, London, 27 October, by dance critic Lyndsey Winship Broad daylight is not the natural milieu of a dance critic, but here we are pitch-side, taking notes on a fourth round premiership clash between Saracens Women and Gloucester-Hartpury. I\u2019ve never watched a rugby match before, and to the outsider, this game, with its hookers and blindside flankers, sounds like some sort of quidditch. But what I saw was 80 minutes of brief dramas, flashes of grace and a frustrating amount of stop-start stasis. Coming from theatre, I found myself yearning for flow. Every few minutes the play stops, a ball goes out or a medic comes on, and there\u2019s a blast of Kaiser Chiefs to fill the gap, or the announcer plugging an upcoming fireworks display. But sometimes you get this beautiful cascading momentum, bodies chasing the ball and chasing each other: a pass, a trip, a roll, a recovery, another run, in seamless motion \u2013 until interrupted by a storming tackle. As someone who deciphers bodies for a living, I enjoyed the intended, and unintended, choreography on the pitch. The set pieces, the line-outs especially \u2013 the adrenalised patter of quick-stepping feet, the surge as a jumper is lifted, soaring upward ramrod straight, stretching out arms and time (just for a millisecond) before being swallowed back into the team. But also the murmurations of the players, waves of Saracens\u2019 black shirts like a tide ebbing westwards, as pink-clad Gloucester-Hartpury pushed them away from their goal, taking an early lead; the way the ball is like a mini black hole, sucking everything towards it, a tight cluster at the centre, but also a swirling galaxy of players moored to its gravity. The interlaced bodies of the scrum could be almost a constructivist choreography \u00e0 la Bronislava Nijinska, or sometimes just a clumsy scramble of bums and thighs. Also, in the way you can\u2019t really see what\u2019s going on, it reminded me of exasperatedly rummaging in your bag for lost keys. The game\u2019s fortunes shift constantly, like this sport\u2019s seemingly ever-changing balance between collective strength and plucky individuals. Gloucester-Hartpury are 12 points up; the pendulum swings with a try from Saracens\u2019 Bryony Field; Gabby Senft scores another; then Saracens lead by nine, but by half-time they\u2019re 12 points down. In a stadium fit for 10,000, a crowd a 10th of that size for this women\u2019s game feels sparse. You need the audience for drama to come alive. It\u2019s not until there are 10 minutes to go and the home team is 35-38 down that survival instinct seems to kick in, on and off pitch, and the slider goes up on the supporters\u2019 noise level. The game is like this \u2013 a lull of energy, a seeming stalemate, and then all of a sudden everything\u2019s at stake, life or death. A runner breaks free: \u201cGo hard! Go hard!\u201d a teammate shouts. Last season\u2019s champions Gloucester-Hartpury had not had two successive defeats this season until now. At the final gong, Saracens win 49-38, and I have found unexpected beauty amid the brute strength. A bit like when the home team wins a corner Dua Lipa at the Royal Albert Hall, London, 17 October, by sports writer Jonathan Liew This is actually the second time I\u2019ve seen Dua Lipa. Six years ago, she was the pre-match entertainment at the Champions League final in Kyiv, and let\u2019s just say that that is a gig that comes with challenges. Nobody is there to see you. The space is vast, the sound system largely designed for safety announcements. Lipa\u2019s voice \u2013 sweet but fragile \u2013 died somewhere around the edge of the penalty area. Several of my colleagues didn\u2019t even look up from their laptops. In a way, this has been a recurring motif of Lipa\u2019s live career: a kind of roaming existence, constant away fixtures, the search for a constituency. Big stadiums seem to flatten her a bit. Glastonbury this summer didn\u2019t quite work. How do you generate devotion when your whole shtick is a kind of arch detachment? What is your natural habitat when you\u2019re a star of the pandemic? Which brings us to a warm and shimmering Albert Hall and this made-for-TV special. This is Dua as Serious Artist: one night only, a pitch for scarcity over volume, even a kind of anti-Eras vibe. Go girl, give us a 53-piece orchestra, every single track off Radical Optimism, your radically mid new album \u2013 no One Kiss, no New Rules. Give us a Gaultier dress and gloves that go up to your biceps. A serpentine walkway cuts a swoosh across the stage, somehow allowing her to walk towards you and away from you at the same time: classic Dua, beckoning you in with one hand and pushing you away with the other. The show sags about a quarter of the way in and again three-quarters in, and by absolutely no coincidence these are the most Radical Optimism-heavy parts. Some of the ornamentation works well \u2013 French Exit gets a nifty jazz-club reboot \u2013 but for all the bells and whistles, these are songs that really weren\u2019t strong enough in the first place. The effect is somewhere between an extremely polished cruise ship performance and that bit in a football game when the home team wins a corner and everyone reluctantly stands up. Naturally, there is an insoluble problem here. Dua longs to contain multitudes, to be one of those rounded, versatile, shape-shifting modern pop stars capable of being all things to all people. You see it in her brand endorsements and her book club, her piecemeal forays into activism. But, ultimately, she has only ever really served one purpose: songs about dancing for people who really, really want to dance. And in this vocation, she remains unmatched by anyone on the planet. Houdini and Levitating at the start. Dance the Night and Don\u2019t Start Now to finish, the climax of a breathtaking encore in which Elton John is winched on stage with all the audacity and flourish of Aston Villa throwing on Jhon Duran as an 85th-minute substitute. A piece of advice, from someone who once dreamed of writing generation-defining novels and now types jokes about football for the Guardian: there comes a point where you have to give up on being taken seriously. Sure, do the Albert Hall for the cachet. Add some strings to Houdini if you think it will impress people. But in the end, lean hard into the stuff people actually want. Which is songs about shit men and dancing so hard you stop crying. Because this stuff is going to be your ticket to immortality. Nail it and your natural habitat will be anywhere with a speaker, your natural constituency anybody with ears and toes to tap. I feel as if I\u2019m on the Starship Enterprise England v Germany at Wembley Stadium, London, 25 October, by classical music critic Flora Willson \u201cYou know where you\u2019re going, don\u2019t you?\u201d says the woman who hands over my press pass. I mumble apologetically. Does it count as impostor syndrome if you\u2019re an actual impostor? They surely don\u2019t get many Wembley first-timers at the media entrance. Or many classical music critics. But here I am, FA-accredited and clueless, for a women\u2019s international friendly. I\u2019ve already run the gamut of girls in tinsel-edged England cowboy hats, groups taking selfies, burger vans, merch stands, lines of stewards and police. Loudspeakers bark instructions like a PE teacher turned dictator. Vast screens pulse constantly. Compared with most classical music venues, Wembley feels like the Starship Enterprise. Inside, the media suite is already full of people typing frantically. After years of indecipherable scribbling in darkened auditoriums, I hadn\u2019t considered bringing my laptop. But it\u2019s obviously not the main thing I lack. \u201cDo you know what formation they play?\u201d one journalist asks his colleague. \u201cI\u2019d probably go 4-2-1-3,\u201d she replies. I try not to panic. I don\u2019t know which team they mean. I couldn\u2019t distinguish 4-2-1-3 from any other formation. And no, I can\u2019t explain the offside rule. I head outside in search of atmosphere \u2013 more familiar territory \u2013 and find an array of industrial sprinklers watering the pitch. Nothing much happens. But suddenly the lights go down, thousands of phone lights twinkle and there are fireworks, pounding drum\u2019n\u2019bass and roaring from the crowd as an enormous England crest is unfurled. Then a fidgety hush. After that, the match starts abruptly. I miss it while trying to spot the brass band I can hear. Idiot music critic, I hear you cry! But missing the vital stuff is horribly easy. Everything happens at astonishing speed, players moving in clusters of whirling legs and breakneck turns, numbers on shirts barely legible. My respect for sports journalists \u2013 writing as they watch the melee, filing as the whistle blows \u2013 reaches a new high. I catch Germany scoring their first goal two minutes in but don\u2019t see what earned a Lioness a yellow card soon after. An England goal generates a deafening response but is disallowed for reasons I can\u2019t fathom. By half-time, the score is 3-2 to Germany. \u201cThis is insane,\u201d mutters one of the real reporters. In the second half, things slow down. A squadron of paper planes floats past, thrown by bored kids in the upper stands. A guy nearby works his way through a massive cup of jellybeans. There are substitutions, near-misses, occasional goals. At one point Germany\u2019s coach waves his arms furiously from the sidelines. As far as I can tell, no one takes any notice. The big screen informs us there are 47,967 people there \u2013 just over 50% capacity. Some are already leaving. And then it\u2019s over: 4-3 to Germany. Downstairs, a sad-looking man in a cardigan presides silently over the press conference room. \u201cWe had too many unforced errors,\u201d concedes the Lionesses\u2019 coach, Sarina Wiegman. By the time I emerge, the crowd has gone. The stadium rings with the low buzz of six lawnmowers, its hallowed pitch now just so much grass. A dark tale \u2013 so dark, it\u2019s hard to take notes Lizzie the Musical at Hope Mill Theatre, Manchester, ends 17 November, by sports writer Tanya Aldred As a cricket reporter, going to work without having to wear an anorak is a good start. The unfamiliarity of this new experience continues in the warmth of Hope Mill\u2019s snug bar, decorated with fairy lights, rugs, chandeliers and old red velvet theatre seats with just the right amount of sag. Those gathered for a pre-show drink are definitely more female than your average County Championship crowd \u2013 though, as at the cricket, a handful sit comfortably alone with only a (very nice) coffee for company. We\u2019re all here for Lizzie the Musical, based on the true story of Lizzie Borden, who was tried for \u2013 and acquitted of \u2013 the murder of her father and stepmother in 1892. The Massachusetts public \u2013 in fact, the wider US \u2013 couldn\u2019t get enough of the scandal. It ticked every titillating box that a burgeoning mass media could blow out: a bloody axe; respectable, if repellent victims; a society spinster suspect; a burnt dress. Fascination with the story has been long-lasting. This show premiered in New York in 2009, and is back in Manchester after a sellout run at Hope Mill last summer. A four-woman cast, fuelled by an electric all-woman band, belt through the murderous buildup and the subsequent court case, with a succession of furious tunes. All four leads hold the stage with gumption, even during the less catchy numbers: the beguiling Katie Tonkinson as meek neighbour Alice, hopelessly in love with Lizzie; Emilie Louise Israel as sharp older sister Emma; and Kayleigh McKnight in the title role, seamlessly switching from heavy sorrow to righteous fury. But the standout turn is Eve Kitchingman as Bridget, the Borden family maid. Performing the part for the first time, as a stand-in for Jennifer Caldwell, she lets emotions peel across her face, a roll of the eye here, a purse of the lips there \u2013 the all-knowing observer of the piece. The seats rise rustically, and steeply, from almost the lip of the stage, in the manner of Old Trafford\u2019s party stand. The intimacy of the venue works particularly well for such a visceral production (though I haven\u2019t worked out how to take notes in the dark). This is complemented by a simple set that makes the most of the industrial beams latticing the ceiling, filling them with doves who will meet a nasty end, while projections are beamed on to the screen. The choreography is thoughtful \u2013 I love the scene set around the coffee pot \u2013 and the long skirts and low-slung belts are worn with riot grrrl attitude. Watching a musical about a double murder \u2013 even if the grisly bits happen offstage \u2013 and listening to lyrics about incest (the desperately sad This Is Not Love) raises more complex emotions than is usual on day two of Derbyshire v Glamorgan. But the high-energy finale matches the glory of a tight last-over finish, only with no statistics to comb through afterwards and no danger of rain stopping play.",

      "bodyText": "Australian federal police officers have commenced a search for documents at the headquarters of PwC Australia in response to the damaging tax leaks scandal. Treasury referred the matter \u2013 which relates to the sharing of confidential multinational tax proposals within the firm \u2013 to police in May last year. In an email to staff on Monday, the firm\u2019s chief executive, Kevin Burrowes, said staff should expect police to remain inside the Sydney headquarters for \u201cseveral days\u201d. \u201cThis step is an expected development in relation to an investigation the AFP commenced in 2023 into the historical tax matter and individuals who have left our firm,\u201d Burrowes told staff. \u201cWe have been working with the AFP to facilitate its attendance and will continue to cooperate with its investigation.\u201d Burrowes urged staff to \u201cplease carry on as usual and remain focused on the important work we\u2019re delivering with our clients and in the community\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email An AFP spokesperson said the force would \u201cprovide an update at an appropriate time\u201d and that there was no threat to public safety. The police investigation, dubbed Operation Alesia, is examining whether former PwC Australia staff committed a crime by disclosing official secrets. Operation Alesia has been deemed a priority investigation for the force, which told parliament in February that it had made international inquiries. Shortly after the referral to police in May 2023, the Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, told parliament that internal PwC emails \u201chighlighted the significant extent of the unauthorised disclosure of confidential commonwealth information and the wide range of individuals within PwC who were directly and indirectly privy to the confidential information\u201d. The emails, tabled in parliament, revealed one former PwC Australia partner under investigation wrote \u201cfor your eyes only\u201d while emailing government secrets to colleagues. This information was then used to win clients in the United States. In a statement, a PwC Australia spokesperson said the firm had since \u201cintroduced significant governance, business and cultural reforms, and our people remain focused on delivering the best outcomes for our clients and communities\u201d. The scandal also led to PwC Australia divesting its entire government advisory service with 1,750 staff to private equity investor Allegro Funds for just $1. Correspondence published by federal parliament last week revealed PwC International was furious with its Australian affiliate for damaging the brand\u2019s reputation. In one email, PwC International\u2019s global general counsel, Diana Weiss, threatened the Australian firm with expulsion from the network unless it handed over ultimate control of the firm\u2019s response to scandal. She called for a new \u201cnetwork representative\u201d to be installed in Australia. \u201cAll decisions relating to the accountability of individuals for the matters under review in the Senate Inquiry and related matters (\u2026) must be reviewed by and agreed with me and the network representative,\u201d Weiss wrote. \u201cThe firm shall not provide to any regulator or other governmental or legal authority any formal, significant or substantive submissions or responses (whether oral or written) regarding any of the topics until the network representative and I have reviewed and approved the materials.\u201d",

In the ruling, US district judge Stephen Locher sided with the state in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of an Iowa Latino group and four recent citizens who had been placed on a list of questionable registrations by local elections officials. Iowa\u2019s Republican attorney general and secretary of state had argued that potentially removing 2,000 names from the list would prevent illegal voting by noncitizens, a move in keeping with other Republican-led efforts across the US. Voting by non-citizens is a Trump campaign issue, despite its rarity. In the Iowa ruling, judge Locher pointed to a US supreme court decision last week that allowed Virginia to resume a similar purge of its voter registration rolls. Locher, a Biden appointee, also noted the appeal court\u2019s refusal to review a Pennsylvania appeals decision on provisional ballots. The judge noted that Iowa\u2019s does not remove anyone from the voter rolls, but rather requires some voters to use provisional ballots. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling is a victory for election integrity,\u201d Iowa governor Kim Reynolds, a Republican, said. \u201cIn Iowa, while we encourage all citizens to vote, we will enforce the law and ensure those votes aren\u2019t cancelled out by the illegal vote of a non-citizen.\u201d Rita Bettis Austen, legal director for the ACLU of Iowa, said her group was \u201cobviously disappointed\u201d with the decision \u201cwhich we still fear threatens to disfranchise eligible voters simply because they are people who became citizens in the past several years\u201d. Iowa secretary of state Paul Pate and state attorney general Brenna Bird said the state had about 250 noncitizens registered to vote but the Biden administration hadn\u2019t forwarded information on them, and the state had relied on a list of potential noncitizens from the Iowa department of transportation. \u201cToday\u2019s court victory is a guarantee for all Iowans that their votes will count and not be canceled out by illegal votes,\u201d Bird said in a statement. The ruling came after a federal judge stopped a similar program in Alabama challenged by civil rights groups and the department of justice.

      "bodyText": "Hello and welcome to another edition of The Crunch! In this week\u2019s newsletter we have charts on the political polarisation of Silicon Valley, how discounting in supermarkets preferences some goods over others, which age groups in the UK are most likely to have an accident while driving and the latest breakdown of where current climate policy is going to take us. But first \u2026 Labor v the Coalition: who is leading in the polls? We have launched our new poll-tracking page. With an election expected some time in the first half of 2025 we\u2019re going to be tracking the polls in aggregate to get a picture of how things are going. The main finding from the model at the moment is there has been a big decline in the estimated two-party preferred support for Labor since the last election, and a corresponding increase in support for the Coalition.

Pricing patterns at supermarkets With the increased scrutiny on supermarkets due to the cost of living crisis in Australia, people are starting to notice some of their stranger pricing practices. This excellent piece from the ABC shows how certain products oscillate between either being half-price or full price and often this pricing regime can alternate between the two major supermarket chains.

The other interesting aspect to supermarket pricing is that certain categories of products are more likely to be discounted, as anyone who has tried to buy washing powder at a supermarket knows.

There is a large gap between climate action and pledges The 15th edition of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) emissions gap report shows there is a \u201cmassive gap between rhetoric and reality\u201d on climate pledges, according to Carbon Brief. This chart from Carbon Brief, adapted from a graph in the report, shows the gap between the world\u2019s emissions under current policy, and if conditional and unconditional commitments to reduce greenhouse gases are met (nationally determined contributions; or NDCs) are met: Importantly it also shows the projected degrees of warming associated with each trajectory, and how far off we are from reducing warming to below 2C and 1.5C respectively. *** 3. Who are Britain\u2019s most dangerous drivers? Tom Calver, data editor at The Times in the UK, has an interesting column about whether younger or older drivers are more dangerous. The statistics show that the risk of an accident is higher among young men, but even higher for the oldest age groups of both sexes. This is measured as the rate of serious car driver casualties per billion miles travelled, so factors in different driving frequencies. However, despite the oldest age groups having the highest risk of accidents, there\u2019s another key statistic to look at. As Tom puts it: \u201cthere aren\u2019t many old drivers, and those that do drive don\u2019t drive very much.\u201d And so, he says, drivers aged 17-24 are responsible for far more accidents than drivers aged over 85. *** 4. Corporate US is becoming more left-leaning and polarised It\u2019s another joy plot. Two in one newsletter? Is it Christmas? John Burn-Murdoch, writing in the FT, highlights an interesting new study on the political leanings of executives and directors at US companies. The study analyses donation records to suggest that corporate America has shifted left over time. But it was this chart from John which caught my eye: The other trend apparent from the data is that polarisation is also increasing, with companies with \u201coverwhelmingly left-leaning or right-leaning leadership teams\u201d rising.

GOP officials across the US have made possible voting by noncitizen immigrants a key election-year talking point even though it is rare. Their focus has come with former President Donald Trump falsely suggesting that his opponents already are committing fraud to prevent his return to the White House.<br><br>In his ruling Sunday, Locher pointed to a US Supreme Court decision four days prior that allowed Virginia to resume a similar purge of its voter registration rolls even though it was impacting some US citizens. He also cited the Supreme Court\u2019s recent refusal to review a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision on state electoral laws surrounding provisional ballots. Those Supreme Court decisions advise lower courts to \u201cact with great caution before awarding last-minute injunctive relief,\u201d he wrote.<br><br>Locher also said the state\u2019s effort does not remove anyone from the voter rolls, but rather requires some voters to use provisional ballots.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-672825d38f080a1fc5f95d36\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-04T01:52:06.122Z\">1.52am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>\u201cI\u2019m the only president in 82 years I had no wars,\u201d Trump says.

His team has noted with satisfaction for weeks that they remain the top two issues for undecided voters across the battleground states.</p> \n  <p>But Trump could not resist reverting to his most problematic impulses of describing Democrats as \u201cdemonic\u201d and then lamenting about the 2020 election, an issue that polls poorly and his team had thought they had convinced him to let it go.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great \u2013 \u201d and then abruptly cut himself off.</p> \n  <p>The remark reflected what Trump told aides and allies in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, a loss he has never conceded, and how he sat in at least one meeting at the end of his first term where he mused about refusing to leave the White House, a person familiar with the matter said.</p> \n  <p>Once Trump started on the 2020 election, he could not stop. He revived debunked conspiracy theories from 2020 and suggested anew that voting machines would be hacked, and efforts to extend polling hours in Pennsylvania \u2013 what his own team has pushed for \u2013 amounted to fraud.</p> \n  <p>Trump also spent time at the rally lashing out at a series of recent polls, notably a Des Moines Register poll in Iowa that put him four points behind Harris in the state of Iowa. Harris is universally not expected to win Iowa, but it could be indicative of her momentum in the final days.</p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s more context on the rally:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/03/trump-election-pennsylvania-rally\">Trump says \u2018I shouldn\u2019t have left\u2019 White House, despite losing 2020 election</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6727d8bb8f080a1fc5f95b8a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-03T20:29:41.990Z\">8.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Harris campaign condemned former president <strong>Donald Trump\u2019s</strong> comments at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier today, where he accused Democrats of stealing the elections from President <strong>Joe Biden</strong> and expressed it \u201cshould be illegal\u201d to release polls that are bad for him. </p> \n  <p>\u201cTrump is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he\u2019s worried he will lose,\u201d said <strong>Ammar Moussa</strong>, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them \u2013 that\u2019s Vice President Harris,\u201d she added. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6727d5978f08b3d97c3649b2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-03T20:09:05.266Z\">8.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> said <strong>Robert F Kennedy Jr\u2019s</strong> proposal to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/03/rfk-jr-trump-remove-fluoride-drinking-water\">remove fluoride from drinking water</a> on his first day in office if elected \u201csounds OK to me\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,\u201d Trump told <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-banning-vaccines-president-rfk-fluoride-rcna178570\">NBC News</a>. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump was asked whether banning certain vaccines would be an option during a second term, and he said he would talk to Kennedy and others before making a decision.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut he\u2019s a very talented guy and has strong views,\u201d Trump said of the former independent presidential candidate.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-03T20:11:32.342Z\">at 8.11pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6727d4418f08b3d97c3649a7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-03T19:53:41.567Z\">7.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Kamala Harris</strong> stopped by Kuzzo\u2019s Chicken &amp; Waffles in Michigan on Sunday, joined by the state\u2019s governor <strong>Gretchen Whitmer</strong> and the mayor of Detroit <strong>Mike Duggan</strong>.</p> \n  <p>The visit comes as Harris campaigns around the Detroit area on Sunday, stopping by and delivering remarks at a church earlier today.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from the live blog today, we\u2019ll be back again on Monday with all the latest updates from the US election campaign. In the meantime, here are the key developments from Sunday, when Kamala Harris and Donald Trump hit the key swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and North Carolina: Kamala Harris pledged to \u201cdo everything in my power to end the war in Gaza\u201d in her final rally in Michigan on Sunday, as she attempted to appeal to the state\u2019s large Arab American and Muslim American population two days out from the election. Michigan is home to about 240,000 registered Muslim voters, a majority of whom voted for Biden in 2020, helping him to a narrow victory over Donald Trump. But Arab Americans and Muslim Americans in the state have expressed dissatisfaction over the vice-president\u2019s stance on Israel\u2019s war on Gaza Harris was making her fourth stop of the day in Michigan, having earlier spoken at a church in Detroit and stopped by a barber shop in Pontiac. Trump is holding his final rally of the campaign in Michigan on Monday night. Donald Trump said he should never have left the White House after his defeat in 2020 and joked darkly he would be fine with reporters getting shot. \u201cWe had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great \u2013 \u201d he said before abruptly cutting himself off. In other comments, as he denigrated the media, he said: \u201cTo get to me, somebody would have to shoot through fake news, and I don\u2019t mind that much, because, I don\u2019t mind. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d Donald Trump again suggested he would give a role on health policy to Robert F Kennedy Jr at a rally in Macon, Georgia. \u201cI told a great guy, RFK Jr., Bobby \u2014 I said, \u2018Bobby, you work on women\u2019s health, you work on health, you work on what we eat. You work on pesticides. You work on everything,\u201d he said. Kennedy, a well known vaccine sceptic, on Saturday said that the former president would push to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected. Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California\u2019s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. The Trump campaign claimed that recent polling by the New York Times and the Des Moines Register is designed to suppress Trump voter turnout by presenting a bleak picture of Trump\u2019s re-election prospects. The memo claims that the Times\u2019s polls have biased samples and overrepresent Democratic voters compared with actual voter registration and turnout trends. Trump also disputed a shock Iowa poll that found Kamala Harris leading the former president in the typically red state 47% to 44%. \u201cNo President has done more for FARMERS, and the Great State of Iowa, than Donald J. Trump,\u201d Trump said in a post on his Truth Social network on Sunday morning. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s not even close! All polls, except for one heavily skewed toward the Democrats by a Trump hater who called it totally wrong the last time, have me up, BY A LOT.\u201d Trump has talked about a huge array of topics, from hurricane Helene (he claims there was no disaster aid for places like Georgia because it was spent on illegal immigrants) and Elon Musk and the economy again. If he gets back in power, he says, he will \u201cend the war in Ukraine\u201d, \u201cstop the chaos in the Middle East\u201d, and \u201cprevent World War III from happening.\u201d He will also \u201ccrush violent crime\u201d and give police more resources, \u201cstrengthen and modernise military\u201d and build a missile defence shield made in the US. He also talks a lot about what he calls \u201ctransgender insanity\u201d. He says there should be one-day voting with paper ballots, with polls closing at 9pm and the result announced half an hour later. Then he talks about the \u201cright to try\u201d an act that allows people with life-threatening illnesses to try drugs that aren\u2019t yet approved by the FDA. He finally ends with some more on the theme of \u201cmaking America great again\u201d and YMCA blasts out with Trump doing his robot dance and fist pumps as he makes his exit. Here\u2019s our full report on Harris\u2019 rally in Michigan: Kamala Harris pledged to \u201cdo everything in my power to end the war in Gaza\u201d in her final rally in Michigan on Sunday, as she attempted to appeal to the state\u2019s large Arab American and Muslim American population two days out from the election. Michigan is home to about 240,000 registered Muslim voters, a majority of whom voted for Biden in 2020, helping him to a narrow victory over Donald Trump. But Arab Americans and Muslim Americans in the state have expressed dissatisfaction over the vice-president\u2019s stance on Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, and polling suggests that these voters are gravitating towards Jill Stein, the Green party candidate. With Harris and the former president essentially tied in Michigan, a drop in voting numbers for either could be critical, and Harris made a clear appeal at the beginning of her speech. \u201cWe are joined today by leaders of the Arab American community, which has deep and proud roots here in Michigan, and I want to say this year has been difficult, given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza and given the civilian casualties and displacement in Lebanon,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt is devastating, and as president, I will do everything in my power to end the war in Gaza, to bring home the hostages, end the suffering in Gaza, ensure Israel is secure and ensure the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, freedom, security and self-determination.\u201d Speaking at the Michigan State University campus, Harris repeated her campaign promise to \u201cturn the page on a decade of politics driven by fear and division\u201d. Harris did not mention Trump by name in East Lansing, as she gave an address that struck a hopeful tone for the future. \u201cAmerica is ready for a fresh start, ready for a new way forward, where we see our fellow American not as an enemy, but as a neighbor,\u201d she said. Stepping away from Trump\u2019s rally for a moment, a federal judge has ruled that Iowa can continue challenging the validity of hundreds of ballots from potential noncitizens even though critics said the effort threatens the voting rights of people who\u2019ve recently become US citizens. Associated Press reports: US district judge Stephen Locher, an appointee of President Joe Biden, sided with the state in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in the Iowa capital of Des Moines on behalf of the League of Latin American Citizens of Iowa and four recently naturalized citizens. The four were on the state\u2019s list of questionable registrations to be challenged by local elections officials. The state\u2019s Republican attorney general and secretary of state argued that investigating and potentially removing 2,000 names would prevent illegal voting by noncitizens. GOP officials across the US have made possible voting by noncitizen immigrants a key election-year talking point even though it is rare. Their focus has come with former President Donald Trump falsely suggesting that his opponents already are committing fraud to prevent his return to the White House. In his ruling Sunday, Locher pointed to a US Supreme Court decision four days prior that allowed Virginia to resume a similar purge of its voter registration rolls even though it was impacting some US citizens. He also cited the Supreme Court\u2019s recent refusal to review a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision on state electoral laws surrounding provisional ballots. Those Supreme Court decisions advise lower courts to \u201cact with great caution before awarding last-minute injunctive relief,\u201d he wrote. Locher also said the state\u2019s effort does not remove anyone from the voter rolls, but rather requires some voters to use provisional ballots. \u201cI\u2019m the only president in 82 years I had no wars,\u201d Trump says. Then he starts talking about the latest jobs report, which he says is fake. This starts a rant on the issue of \u201cfake jobs reports\u201d in which he also castigates the \u201cfake news media\u201d. \u201cThey hate me but ratings predominate over hate,\u201d he says of the media. Then he again lays into illegal migrants, who he says have taken every single new job. Then he meanders into the problem of inflation and the Great Depression, saying: \u201cI would not want to be Herbert Hoover, what a time that was, people jumping off buildings.\u201d He tells a short story about an \u201cold woman goes into a grocery store and she takes three apples, that\u2019s what she lives on.\u201d But she can only afford to pay for two, he says. \u201cWe will make America affordable again,\u201d he says. Then he talks about his poll numbers. Trump spends some more time demonising migrants saying \u201cthe United States is now an occupied country\u201d and claims November 4 will be \u201cliberation day\u201d. He says Harris has \u201cimported\u201d criminals and that he will expedite deportations of criminal gangs. He once again says he will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows the country to deport non-citizens during war time, and calls for the death penalty for any migrant who kills an American or a law enforcement officer. He also says he will immediately ban sanctuary cities. He then pivots to talking about the economy. \u201cWe\u2019ll handle inflation, you know how we\u2019ll handle it, we\u2019ll drill, drill, drill,\u201d he says, repeating his line that Robert F Kennedy shouldn\u2019t interfere with the \u201cliquid gold\u201d. Then he jumps to the terrorist group Isis, claiming he defeated it in four weeks. Trump next spoke a little about the case of Minelys Zoe Rodriguez-Ramirez, who was found dead last week after allegedly being murdered by an illegal immigrant, and invited her mother up to talk about her daughter. Trump has repeatedly targeted immigrants in his campaign, blaming them for crime and stealing American jobs, and threatening to carry out the \u201clargest deportation program in American history\u201d, a phrase he repeats in Macon. Donald Trump starts by promising to \u201cend inflation\u201d, stop the \u201cinvasion of criminals\u201d from across the border and bring back the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d and urges his supporters to vote on Tuesday. \u201cThis will be the Golden Age of America,\u201d he says. Then he talks about how he has urged Robert F Kennedy Jr, who dropped his own presidential campaign to back Trump, to work on women\u2019s health and pesticides. \u201cI told a great guy, RFK Jr., Bobby \u2014 I said, \u2018Bobby, you work on women\u2019s health, you work on health, you work on what we eat. You work on pesticides. You work on everything,\u201d he says. Kennedy said on Saturday that the former president would push to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected. It has been rumoured Kennedy, a vaccine-sceptic among other things, could take a role in leading health and food policy in a Trump administration. However Trump adds that he won\u2019t let Kennedy, also known as an environmental lawyer, interfere in drilling for oil. He says: \u201cThe one thing you have to let me do, Bobby, I gotta work the liquid gold,\u201d Trump says. Then he experiments with Kamala Harris\u2019 name a bit, ending with: \u201cWhen I says Harris nobody knows who the hell I\u2019m talking about.\u201d Donald Trump has finally made his way on to the stage in Macon, Georgia, 90 minutes late. He walks slowly, sways a bit to the music and points to the crowd. It\u2019s his third rally of the day after previous stops in the other battleground states of Pennsylvania and North Carolina. When he starts speaking his voice sounds hoarse. And a few pics from the Trump campaign on Sunday: We\u2019re still waiting for Trump in Georgia, where we\u2019ve just had Stephen Miller, senior Trump advisor, on stage and now House majority leader Steven Scalise. Scalise promises Trump, who is now well over an hour late, will be out in a few minutes. A few pics from the Harris campaign trail in Michigan on Sunday: More than 77 million Americans have already voted ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election, according to the University of Florida\u2019s Election Lab. That\u2019s almost half the total of 160 million votes cast in 2020, the highest turnout the US has seen in more than a century. Of the votes so far returned, 42,195,018 were returned in person and 35,173,674 by mail. MESA, Arizona \u2014 At 20 years old, Melissa Gutierrez has never voted in an election, but she\u2019s not really sure that her vote matters all that much, anyway. She\u2019s still baffled by the fact that Donald Trump lost the popular vote but won the presidency in 2016 due to, as Gutierrez recalled it, \u201cthe school thing\u201d. \u201cThe electoral college?\u201d a reporter asked Gutierrez, who stood on the porch of her parents\u2019 home in Mesa, Arizona. \u201cYeah, there you go,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cI was like: what the fuck is the point?\u201d A single vote in Arizona, however, may be far more important to the future of the United States than the millions of votes cast in states like New York and California. Under the electoral college, candidates only win the White House by winning the popular votes within states and then tallying up each state\u2019s electoral college votes \u2013 which are assigned based on a state\u2019s population \u2013 until they hit the magic number of 270. (However, Maine and Nebraska can split their electoral college votes up to different candidates.) In 2020, Joe Biden became the first Democrat since 1996 to win Arizona and its 11 electoral college votes. He eked out that victory with just over 10,000 votes \u2013 making Arizona one of the most prized swing states in the 2024 election. Informed of Arizona\u2019s importance in the election, Gutierrez said: \u201cI honestly did not even know that.\u201d Gutierrez is far from the only American to be baffled by the electoral college system: just 40% can name the institution that chooses the president if the electoral college ends in a tie, the Pew Research Center has found. (It\u2019s the House of Representatives, but the Senate plays a role, too.) In general, Americans have relatively low civics literacy. While 65% can name all three branches of government, 15% cannot name any, according to the 2024 version of the annual Annenberg Constitution Day Civics Survey. One in five Americans also cannot name a single right guaranteed by the First Amendment. Many Americans also have a low view of the electoral college. More than 60% of Americans would like to see it abolished, according to Pew. \u201cThis is a very unique and bespoke system that I think nobody would create again today,\u201d Wendy R Weiser, vice president for democracy at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School, told the New York Times. Gutierrez said she plans to vote for Kamala Harris on Tuesday. She wishes that Harris would take a more hardline approach to immigration, but she also finds Trump to be nonsensical. \u201cHonestly, I just want the abortion access,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d We\u2019re still waiting for Trump in Georgia, where lieutenant governor of Georgia, Burt Jones, earlier took to the stage followed by Herschel Walker, a former Republican Senate candidate in Georgia. Now we\u2019re listening to a selection of pop and rock classics. At a Harris event in central Phoenix, actor Eva Longoria commented on the comedian who insulted Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage,\u201d saying it was aligned with how Trump has talked about Latinos since the start. He started his quest for president by calling Mexicans \u201crapists,\u201d she said, and he ended it with the rally where Puerto Ricans were insulted. \u201cWe were all Puerto Rican that day, and we were all Mexican on the first day,\u201d she said. \u201cAs Latinos, we can decide who is the next President of the United States, because Latinos are Americans.\u201d I\u2019m out in central Phoenix at a restaurant where a host of Latino actors, influencers and politicians are rallying for Kamala Harris and Ruben Gallego, the state\u2019s Democratic senator nominee, in an event called \u201cpachanga to the polls.\u201d Signs, pins and shirts around the venue show Harris and Gallego on loteria cards in the unexpectedly rainy day in the desert city. Rosario Dawson, an actor and longtime activist, said she had been involved in political causes since childhood because of her family, and she had now just brought her daughter to the polls to vote for the first time. \u201cI have been walking in marches since Al Sharpton still wore tracksuits,\u201d Dawson said. The raucous crowd of ardent Harris supporters, wearing camo hats and holding blue Harris signs, cheered for Gallego and resoundingly answered yes when asked if they had already voted. Democratic senator Mark Kelly introduced his wife, former representative Gabby Giffords, who was injured in an assassination attempt when she was a member of Congress. He said she was responsible for getting him into the business. \u201cSometimes I think to myself, if I was the person who would have been injured, would Gabby have become an astronaut?\u201d he joked. Giffords spoke about how Joe Biden reached out to her during her recovery and called him a great man, and said Harris would defeat the gun lobby. Senator Marco Rubio is now on the stage and is accusing the mainstream media of attempting to \u201cundermine and prevent Trump from being elected\u201d. He\u2019s also making fun of Harris\u2019 laugh. Observers have suggested the Trump campaign is trying to lay the foundation for claiming the election was stolen if he loses by planting the idea that the only way he could lose is because Democrats cheat. Next up we\u2019re expecting Donald Trump to take the stage in Macon, Georgia, where Arkansas governor and former Trump press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders is currently warming up the crowd. Georgia is another swing state \u2013 it went for Biden in 2020 by 11,779 votes, out of 5m ballots cast, the first time since 1992 that the state turned blue. And that\u2019s it from Harris, who wraps up her speech, waves to supporters and makes her exit to the familiar sound of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Freedom. After talking about her history as a prosecutor, Harris also homes in on young people and first-time voters, proclaiming \u201cI love Gen Z!\u201d \u201cYou are all rightly impatient for change,\u201d she says, repeating remarks she has made recently about the younger generation having grown up only knowing the climate crisis, active shooter drills and with women having fewer rights than their mothers. She starts by making remarks on the Middle East, noting in particular the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. \u201cThis year has been difficult, given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza and given the civilian casualties and displacement in Lebanon, it is devastating,\u201d she says. As president I will do everything in my power to end the war in Gaza, to bring home the hostages, end the suffering in Gaza, ensure Israel is secure and ensure the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, freedom, security and self-determination. Michigan is the swing state with the US\u2019s largest Arab American population and many have been dismayed by the Biden administration\u2019s response to the Gaza war. While calling for peace, it has also supplied Israel with billions of dollars worth of weapons. Kamala Harris has taken the stage in East Lansing, Michigan. We\u2019ll bring you any standout moments as they happen. This is Helen Livingstone taking over from my colleague, Coral Murphy Marcos. The Trump campaign claimed that recent polling by the New York Times and the Des Moines Register is designed to suppress Trump voter turnout by presenting a bleak picture of Trump\u2019s re-election prospects. The memo claims that the Times\u2019s polls have biased samples and overrepresent Democratic voters compared with actual voter registration and turnout trends. Kamala Harris made several stops in Michigan today, delivering remarks at a church service in the morning and later visiting a chicken and waffles joint in Detroit. She\u2019ll be holding a rally later today in East Lansing. Donald Trump delivered a speech in Lancaster county, a sector that rarely ever switches parties, usually voting for the Republican nominee in presidential elections. The former president told supporters that he should have stayed in the White House, despite his losing the 2020 election, while at Lititz. Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California\u2019s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. After a speech in Pennsylvania, Trump delivered his remarks in Kinston, North Carolina. He accused his opponent Kamala Harris of doing \u201cthe worst job ever on hurricane salvage and removal\u201d and attacked Senate GOP minority leader Mitch McConnell. That\u2019s all from me, Coral Murphy Marcos, for today. My colleague Helen Livingstone will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest from the US election. Kamala Harris is scheduled to deliver remarks in about half an hour in East Lansing, Michigan, taking the stage at Michigan State University. Harris landed at Detroit Metro airport at 1am this morning, and stopped in several locations in Detroit before heading to the Jenison Field House arena for her speech at 6pm ET. This morning, Harris delivered remarks at a Sunday church service in Detroit and later visited Kuzzo\u2019s Chicken &amp; Waffles, joined by Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer and Detroit mayor Mike Duggan. Donald Trump disputed an Iowa poll showing Kamala Harris ahead in red state. The former president has passionately disputed a shock Iowa poll that found the vice-president leading Trump in the typically red state 47% to 44%. \u201cNo President has done more for FARMERS, and the Great State of Iowa, than Donald J. Trump,\u201d Trump said in a post on his Truth Social network on Sunday morning. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s not even close! All polls, except for one heavily skewed toward the Democrats by a Trump hater who called it totally wrong the last time, have me up, BY A LOT.\u201d Trump continued, in all caps: \u201cI love the farmers, and they love me. And they trust me.\u201d More than 85% of Iowa\u2019s land is used for farming and it produces more corn, pigs, eggs, ethanol and biodiesel than any other state. On Saturday, the Selzer poll carried out for the Des Moines Register newspaper showed Harris ahead of her Republican rival by three points. Selzer is a widely respected polling organisation with a good record in Iowa; she shot to polling fame in 2008 when she predicted that a virtually unknown senator, Barack Obama, would beat frontrunner Hillary Clinton in the Iowa caucuses. If Harris were even competitive in Iowa \u2013 which Trump won in both 2016 and 2020 \u2013 it could radically reshape the race. The pollster told MSNBC on Sunday that Harris was leading in early voting in Iowa \u201cbecause of her strength with women generally, even stronger with women aged 65 and older. Her margin is more than 2-to-1 \u2013 and this is an age group that shows up to vote or votes early in disproportionately large numbers.\u201d Earlier on Sunday, Trump\u2019s campaign released a memo from its chief pollster and its chief data consultant calling the Des Moines Register poll \u201ca clear outlier\u201d and saying that an Emerson College poll \u2013 also released Saturday \u2013 more closely reflected the state of the Iowa electorate. The Emerson poll found 53% of likely voters support Trump and 43% support Harris, with 3% undecided and 1% planning to vote for a third-party candidate. The Trump campaign, which many Democrats believe is setting the stage for a series of legal challenges to poll results, also said in an email that the Des Moines Register poll and a subsequent New York Times swing state poll that found Harris ahead in four of the seven states, is \u201cbeing used to drive a voter suppression narrative against President Trump\u2019s supporters\u201d. Here\u2019s more context on the Selzer poll: Donald Trump kept his speech short in Kinston, North Carolina, sticking to most of the talking points he uses during his rallies. He accused Kamala Harris of ruining the economy, delivered anti-immigrant remarks, promising to impose harsher measures on the southern border, and encouraged members of the crowd to \u201cfight, fight fight\u201d. A US government communications regulator has claimed that Vice-President Kamala Harris\u2019s surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live violates \u201cequal time\u201d rules that govern political programming. Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris\u2019s appearance on the show \u201cis a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC\u2019s Equal Time rule\u201d. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. \u201cThe purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct \u2013 a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,\u201d said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: \u201cEqual opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.\u201d A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: \u201cThe FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.\u201d Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her \u201cmirror image\u201d sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. \u201cI\u2019m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can\u2019t do \u2013 you can open doors,\u201d Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. Here\u2019s more on the claim by the FCC regulator: Senator Raphael Warnock condemned Donald Trump after saying that, whether women like it or not, he will \u201cprotect women\u201d. Warnock told NBC News that the comment \u2018sounds rather ominous coming from the mouth of a convicted sexual predator. We don\u2019t need a predator, we need a president in the Oval Office, and that person is clearly Kamala Harris.\u2019 Donald Trump started delivering his remarks in Kinston, North Carolina, about two hours behind schedule. So far, he\u2019s accused his opponent Kamala Harris of doing \u201cthe worst job ever on hurricane salvage and removal\u201d and attacked Senate GOP minority leader Mitch McConnell. \u201cHopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,\u201d Trump said. \u201cCan you believe he endorsed me? Boy, that must\u2019ve been a painful day in his life.\u201d Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said he expects the winner of the presidential election to be declared on election day. In an interview with ABC News, the former president was asked whether he thought there was any way he could lose. \u201cYeah, I guess, you know,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI guess you could lose, can lose. I mean, that happens, right? But I think I have a pretty substantial lead \u2026 Bad things could happen. You know, things happen, but it\u2019s going to be interesting.\u201d He also told the outlet\u2019s chief Washington correspondent, Jonathan Karl, that he has \u201ca substantial lead\u201d in the presidential race. Kamala Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California\u2019s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. \u201cI am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it\u2019s the Sunday before the election and I don\u2019t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other,\u201d Harris told reporters. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. Donald Trump told supporters that he should have stayed in the White House, despite his losing the 2020 election, while at Lititz in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday. The former president\u2019s remarks were made during one of his final rallies of the campaign, where he also denounced public polls putting him behind his rival Kamala Harris and joked that reporters could take a bullet for him. The comments were off script \u2013 an acknowledgment of how he has become increasingly uninhibited as the fatigue of doing multiple rallies a day has inexorably taken its toll. Trump stayed on message for some of his remarks, saying illegal immigration was down and the economy was up when he was president. His team has noted with satisfaction for weeks that they remain the top two issues for undecided voters across the battleground states. But Trump could not resist reverting to his most problematic impulses of describing Democrats as \u201cdemonic\u201d and then lamenting about the 2020 election, an issue that polls poorly and his team had thought they had convinced him to let it go. \u201cWe had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great \u2013 \u201d and then abruptly cut himself off. The remark reflected what Trump told aides and allies in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, a loss he has never conceded, and how he sat in at least one meeting at the end of his first term where he mused about refusing to leave the White House, a person familiar with the matter said. Once Trump started on the 2020 election, he could not stop. He revived debunked conspiracy theories from 2020 and suggested anew that voting machines would be hacked, and efforts to extend polling hours in Pennsylvania \u2013 what his own team has pushed for \u2013 amounted to fraud. Trump also spent time at the rally lashing out at a series of recent polls, notably a Des Moines Register poll in Iowa that put him four points behind Harris in the state of Iowa. Harris is universally not expected to win Iowa, but it could be indicative of her momentum in the final days. Here\u2019s more context on the rally: The Harris campaign condemned former president Donald Trump\u2019s comments at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier today, where he accused Democrats of stealing the elections from President Joe Biden and expressed it \u201cshould be illegal\u201d to release polls that are bad for him. \u201cTrump is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he\u2019s worried he will lose,\u201d said Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign. \u201cThe American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them \u2013 that\u2019s Vice President Harris,\u201d she added. Donald Trump said Robert F Kennedy Jr\u2019s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected \u201csounds OK to me\u201d. \u201cWell, I haven\u2019t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,\u201d Trump told NBC News. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s possible.\u201d Trump was asked whether banning certain vaccines would be an option during a second term, and he said he would talk to Kennedy and others before making a decision. \u201cBut he\u2019s a very talented guy and has strong views,\u201d Trump said of the former independent presidential candidate. Kamala Harris stopped by Kuzzo\u2019s Chicken &amp; Waffles in Michigan on Sunday, joined by the state\u2019s governor Gretchen Whitmer and the mayor of Detroit Mike Duggan. The visit comes as Harris campaigns around the Detroit area on Sunday, stopping by and delivering remarks at a church earlier today. A stop in East Lansing is also scheduled for later today. DJ Cassidy, Fat Joe, Freeway and Just Blaze, Lady Gaga, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Ricky Martin, The Roots, Jazmine Sullivan, Adam Blackstone, and Oprah Winfrey are slated to make appearances in support for the vice-president at an event in Pennsylvania on Monday. In Raleigh, North Carolina, Fantasia Barrino, James Taylor, Remi Wolf, and Sugarland will also perform at a campaign event on election day eve. Meanwhile, performances by 2 Chainz, Anthony Hamilton, Ciara, and Joy of Jesse &amp; Joy, with remarks by Usher, will take place in Atlanta, Georgia. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said that Trump\u2019s comments about a potential assassin having to \u201cshoot through\u201d the press to get to him at a rally today had \u201cnothing to do with the Media being harmed\u201d. \u201cPresident Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life,\u201d said Steven Cheung, Trump\u2019s campaign communications director. \u201cPresident Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also,\u201d Cheung said. During a rally in Pennsylvania earlier, Trump said: I have this glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don\u2019t mind that so much. He did not mention that the media should also have protective glass. The Harris-Walz campaign announced a slew of election day Eve events, including rallies in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. In Arizona, Harris-Walz supporters will rally in Phoenix with a performance by the band La Original Banda El Lim\u00f3n. On Monday, the campaign will also hold an event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day slated to perform. In Detroit, Michigan, the Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi, and The War and Treaty will take the stage in support of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Eva Longoria is scheduled to make remarks at an event with performances by Christina Aguilera, Los Tigres Del Norte and SOFI TUKKER. Kamala Harris delivered remarks at the Greater Emmanuel Institutional church of God in Christ in Detroit, Michigan. Harris is making several stops in Michigan and is slated to hold a rally in East Lansing later today. \u201cSo church, in just two days we have the power to decide the fate of our nation, for generations to come,\u201d Harris said at Sunday\u2019s service. Harris said that God\u2019s plan is to \u201cheal us and bring us together as nation\u201d, but that it is not enough to believe in those plans, we \u201cmust act\u201d. \u201cNot enough to only pray, not enough to just talk, we must act on the plans he has in store for us. And we must make them real through our works, in our daily choices, in service to our communities and yes, in our democracy,\u201d the Democratic nominee said. Former president Donald Trump concluded his remarks in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, home to the largest Amish community in the country. Later today, Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Kinston, North Carolina, at 2pm ET. Four-and-a-half hours later, he\u2019s scheduled to deliver remarks in Macon, Georgia. More than 100 former US senators, members of Congress, governors, top-ranking military veterans, and White House officials released a bipartisan statement emphasizing the importance of American trust in elections and the peaceful transfer of power. \u201cElection workers must be supported, not threatened. Upholding public confidence in how elections work and in the members of our communities across the country who are working tirelessly to administer safe and secure elections strengthens us as a nation,\u201d they wrote. Some of the signatories include former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, former defense secretary Leon Panetta, former director of national intelligence Dan Coats, and retired Gen Stanley McChrystal. Donald Trump invited David McCormick, the Republican candidate in Pennsylvania for the US Senate, to the stage. McCormick took a stab at his opponent Bob Casey, calling him a candidate \u201cborn with a silver political spoon in his mouth\u201d. Polls show the Democratic incumbent ahead in the race. Former president Donald Trump told a crowd in Lititz, Pennsylvania, that he wouldn\u2019t mind if a shooter were to \u201cshoot through\u201d the press. \u201cTo get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don\u2019t mind that so much,\u201d Trump said. He also called the press \u201cseriously corrupt people\u201d. So far, during a rally in Pennsylvania, Donald Trump has questioned the validity of voting machines, claimed Democrats stole the elections for Joe Biden, and repeated unverifiable claims about the origin of Covid-19. Regarding voting machines, the former president claimed that they can be hacked. \u201cThe machines are going to really hit me hard, because, you know, they never heard anybody hit them like this,\u201d he said. It\u2019s worth mentioning states routinely test and certify their voting machines. Officials also conduct checks to make sure ballots are properly counted before election results are finalized. Trump also claimed that the current economy is showing \u201cdepression-type numbers\u201d before linking the economy with immigration through anti-immigrant comments. North Dakota governor Doug Burgum downplayed the offensive joke made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe about Puerto Rico at a Trump rally last week. During an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d, Burgum said the joke doesn\u2019t represent Trump supporters\u2019 views. During a rally in New York City, Hinchcliffe called the U.S. territory \u201ca floating island of garbage.\u201d \u201cThe crowd was groaning,\u201d Burgum said. \u201cI mean, there was not approval from a very supportive Trump audience.\u201d He also called Hinchcliffe a \u201ccomic that no one\u2019s ever heard of\u201d. The North Dakota governor also criticized President Biden\u2019s response to the joke, accusing Biden of unfairly labeling Trump supporters. The White House later clarified Biden\u2019s intent was to condemn the rally\u2019s rhetoric, not the supporters. Former president Donald Trump accused recent polls of being \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cfake\", alluding to recent polling from The New York Times. \u201cWe got all this crap going on with the press and with the fake stuff and fake polls,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe polls are just as corrupt as some of the writers back there.\u201d These comments come minutes after the Trump campaign released a memo accusing The New York Times of releasing a \u201cvoter suppression\u201d poll designed to dampen their voters\u2019s enthusiasm. Former president Donald Trump began delivering his remarks in Lancaster County more than an hour behind schedule. He took the stage with an ominous walkout song before Lee Greenwood\u2019s \u201cGod Bless The U.S.A.\u201d started playing. Lancaster County rarely ever switches parties, usually voting for the Republican nominee in presidential elections. Pennsylvania has consistently voted for the Democratic nominee since 1992, with the exception of former President Donald Trump in 2016. The Trump campaign claimed that recent polling by The New York Times and Des Moines Register is designed to suppress Trump voter turnout by presenting a bleak picture of Trump\u2019s reelection prospects. \u201cSome in the media are choosing to amplify a mad dash to dampen and diminish voter enthusiasm,\u201d reads the memo from Trump campaign pollsters, Tony Fabrizio and Tim Saler. \u201cIt has not worked. Our voters are like President Trump: they fight.\u201d The memo claims that the Times\u2019s polls have biased samples and overrepresent Democratic voters compared to actual voter registration and turnout trends. Democratic senator Jon Fetterman from Pennsylvania, where Donald Trump is currently holding a rally, took a stab at the former president after his campaign launched ads doubling down on attacks on trans people. '\u201cIt\u2019s just a warped version of, it doesn\u2019t make you tough,\u201d he said during an interview with CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make you a man to pick on trans or gay kids. It just makes you an a-hole.\u201d Democratic senator Raphael Warnock from Georgia was confident Black voters would turn up at the polls in support of Kamala Harris. In an interview with NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d, Warnock said: \u201cI was in Michigan a couple weeks ago, in a Black fraternity house, my own fraternity. I\u2019ve spent time in barber shops. I\u2019ve been encountering folks, obviously in my church, and other churches. And there is momentum for Kamala Harris, and the more voters hear about her, including Black men, the more they they like her.\u201d His impression from these encounters is that former president Donald Trump will feel the hit from the lack of support from Black voters. \u201cLet me tell you something. Black men are not going to show up in droves and waves voting for Donald Trump,\u201d the senator said. \u201cThey\u2019re not, and it\u2019s because they know who he is.\u201d Warnock pointed to Trump\u2019s actions in the late 1980s against a group of Black and Latino men, known as the \u201cCentral Park Five\u201d, who were accused of murdering a jogger. The five men have always denied the crime and were later exonerated. Former president Donald Trump is expected to deliver his remarks soon in Lititz, Pennsylvania. Trump will appear on stage at the Lancaster Airport on Sunday, with his speech scheduled for 10 a.m. ET. The Republican nominee will also hold events in Reading and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Monday. We\u2019ll be following the former president\u2019s comments, so stick around. As well as her evening event in East Lansing, Kamala Harris is due to make two further stops in Michigan today, the Detroit Free Press reports. A senior Harris campaign official, who declined to be identified, told the outlet that the Democratic nominee will attend church in Detroit on Sunday and visit the city\u2019s Livernois area. Strong turnout in Detroit is generally crucial to Democratic success in Michigan. Harris will then make a stop in Pontiac, another city with a significant Black population and historic ties to the auto industry, the official said. Who would win in a fight between Arnold Schwarzenegger and Hulk Hogan? While the Terminator star and former Republican governor of California endorsed Kamala Harris just days ago, the ex-Obama supporting wrestler told the Republican national convention that: \u201cWe never had it better than the Trump years.\u201d So although, as far as I know, the two musclebound stars have never come to blows, if they were to meet soon there could be some heated disagreement over the presidential race! You can see the full list of celeb endorsements here We have already covered the presidential nominees\u2019 schedules but what are their running mates up to? Tim Walz will be in North Carolina this evening. The Queen City News says details are limited but according to a press release, Walz will hold an event in Gastonia to encourage voters to cast their ballots. Earlier in the day, former president Bill Clinton will hold a campaign rally at a church in Charlotte at 10am, it says. Meanwhile, JD Vance and Donald Trump Jr will hold a rally in Derry, New Hampshire, at 7 pm ET at the New England Sports Center. From the threat of mass deportation of migrants to the risk of military takeovers of American cities \u2013 here\u2019s what\u2019s at stake if Donald Trump wins the election. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump remain in a tight race in the country\u2019s seven battleground states, according to the final New York Times/Siena College poll. It showed Harris with marginal leads in Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin and Trump just ahead in Arizona. The two are in close races in Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania, according to the poll, which surveyed 7,879 likely voters in the seven states from Oct 24 to Nov 2. In all seven states, the matchups were within the poll\u2019s 3.5% margin of error. About 40% of the respondents had already voted and Harris led among those voters by 8 percentage points, while Trump leads with voters who say they are very likely to vote but have not yet done so, the poll found. The tied race in Pennsylvania shows Trump gaining momentum in a state Harris had led by four percentage points in all prior New York Times polls, the outlet said. Historians have weighed in with analysis that Donald Trump now heads a movement close to fascism, Trump himself has spoken of \u201cenemies within\u201d, he and his followers held a mass rally of racist rhetoric in a New York city venue known for an infamous Nazi gathering before the second world war and his language has been tinged with violent imagery. Yet, in Trump\u2019s world, and those of his followers and campaign surrogates, it is the Democrats who are to blame for the degraded discourse in American politics, their rhetoric a sign that they demonize the other side. It is Kamala Harris who is far outside the American mainstream. It is Joe Biden who is a Marxist. It is the Democratic party who plots a complete remaking of the American way of life. They are even, they argue, trying to take away Americans\u2019 hamburgers. Read the full story on Trump\u2019s \u2018mirror world\u2019. The results on Election Day will come down to seven states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Associated Press, which the Guardian uses as the benchmark for results, reports that it will be a game of hopscotch to keep up with key times in each of the states, which stretch across four different time zones. It has a look at the Election Day timeline across the seven, with all listings in Eastern Standard Time: Arizona Polls open at 8 am and close at 9 pm. AP first reported Arizona results at 10:02 pm ET on Nov 3 2020, Election Day, and declared Joe Biden the state\u2019s winner at 2:51 am ET on Nov 4. Georgia Polls open at 7 am and close at 7 pm. In 2020, the AP first reported Georgia results at 7:20 pm on Nov 3 and declared Biden the state\u2019s winner at 7:58 pm ET on Nov 19, more than two weeks later. Michigan Polls open at 7 am, most close at 8 pm, with the rest at 9 pm. In 2020, the AP first reported Michigan results at 8:08 pm on Nov 3 and declared Biden the winner at 5:58 pm on Nov 4. Nevada Polls open at 10am and close at 10pm. In 2020, the AP first reported Nevada results at 11:41 pm on Nov 3 and declared Biden the winner at 12:13pm on Nov 7. North Carolina Polls open at 6:30am and close at 7:30 pm. In 2020, the AP first reported results at 7:42 pm on Nov 3 and declared Donald Trump the winner at 3:49 pm ET on Nov 13. Pennsylvania Polls open at 7 am and close at 8 pm. In 2020, the AP first reported results at 8:09 pm on Nov 3 and declared Biden the winner at 11:25am on Nov 7. Wisconsin Polls open at 8 am and close at 9 pm. In 2020, the AP first reported Wisconsin results at 9:07 pm on No. 3 and declared Biden the winner at 2:16 pm on Nov 4. Europe will need to rethink its support of Ukraine if Donald Trump is elected, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n said on Sunday, as the continent \u201cwill not be able to bear the burdens of the war alone\u201d. Orban opposes military aid to Ukraine and has made clear he thinks Trump shares his views and would negotiate a peace settlement for Ukraine. The Trump ally said: \u201cWe (in Europe) need to realize that if there will be a pro-peace president in America, which I not only believe in but I also read the numbers that way, ... if what we expect happens and America becomes pro-peace, then Europe cannot remain pro-war,\u201d Orban said. \u201cEurope cannot bear the burden of [the war] alone, and if Americans switch to peace, then we also need to adapt,\u201d Orban said. Europe is jittery about how the outcome of the US election will affect the war in Ukraine and the continent\u2019s security. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has hit out at a surprise poll which showed Kamala Harris three points ahead in Iowa, a state that was previously expected to be a safe state for the Republicans. The Trump campaign released a memo from its chief pollster and its chief data consultant calling the Des Moines Register poll \u201ca clear outlier,\u201d and saying that an Emerson College poll \u2013 also released Saturday \u2013 more closely reflected the state of the Iowa electorate. The Emerson College Polling/RealClearDefense survey of a similar number of likely voters on November 1-2 had a starkly different result, with Trump leading Harris by 10 points. This poll also has a 3.4 percentage point margin of error. The Emerson College survey had Trump with strong leads over Harris among men and independents, while Harris was performing well with those under the age of 30. Donald Trump and his many campaign surrogates have been engaged in a strategy of publicly raising expectations among their followers which may create a well-spring of discontent should Kamala Harris win, especially if her victory is narrow or propelled over the line by a late-breaking wave of Democratic ballots. \u201cIf we could bring God down from heaven and he\u2019d be the vote counter, we\u2019d win this, we\u2019d win California, we\u2019d win a lot of states,\u201d Trump said last week in a typical piece of bombast about his prospects. But internal sources tell the Guardian they are universally jittery about the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania, through which most of Trump\u2019s paths to 270 electoral college votes run. Internal polls show Trump ahead but some of those numbers have been so rosy in recent weeks that aides have grown distrustful about their accuracy. The Trump campaign has also been nervous about North Carolina \u2013 a state they really have to hold this year \u2013 evidenced by the multiple trips Trump is making to the state in the final weekend. Trump had two rallies in North Carolina yesterday, and will be there again today and tomorrow. Read the full piece here In the campaign\u2019s final days, Kamala Harris has sought to convince voters that she will bring down the cost of living, Reuters reports. It a top concern after several years of inflation. She has also portrayed Donald Trump as dangerous and erratic and urged Americans to move on from Trump\u2019s divisive approach to politics. We have an opportunity in this election to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We\u2019re done with that,\u201d she said in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Saturday. Trump has argued that Harris, as the sitting vice president, should be held responsible for the rising prices and high levels of immigration of the past several years, which he has portrayed as an existential threat to the country. The only free aid they are going to get is a free ride back home,\u201d he said at a rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, on Saturday. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the 2024 US presidential election as we move into the final hours before polls open on Tuesday. It\u2019s set to be a busy day for Donald Trump with appearances in three swing states and it comes amid a surprise setback in Iowa with a poll showing him trailing Kamala Harris in what was previously expected to be a safe state for the Republicans. The Republican nominee will kick off this morning with a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, followed by an afternoon event in Kinston, North Carolina, and rounding the day off in Macon, Georgia. Harris, meanwhile, will head to Michigan later today where the Democratic hopeful is due to speak at a campaign rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Last night, she broke from the campaign trail to embrace her reputation as a \u201cjoyful warrior\u201d with a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live. Harris portrayed herself, appearing in a mirror opposite the actor Maya Rudolph, who first played her on the show in 2019 and has reprised the role this season. If you missed it, you can read David Smith\u2019s fun report here: In other developments: A Georgia judge rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person. The lawsuit only targeted Fulton county, a Democratic stronghold. Trump falsely blamed Fulton county workers for his loss of the 2020 election in Georgia. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women\u2019s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday. Kennedy said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water.",

I was elected to deliver security for the British people. And strong borders are a part of that. But security doesn\u2019t stop at our borders.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing progressive about turning a blind eye as men, women and children die in the Channel,\u201d he will say.</p> <p>Starmer will tell the gathering that the counter-terror tactics could include the ability to shut down bank accounts, cut off internet access and seize evidence before offences take place.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking our approach to counter-terrorism, which we know works, and applying it to the gangs, with our new Border Security Command. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re ending the fragmentation between policing, Border Force and our intelligence agencies,\u201d he will say.</p> <p>Later in the week, he will hold talks on the boats crisis with European leaders, including the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, at a summit in Hungary.</p> <p>Despite irregular immigration into the EU being a fraction of what it was in 2015, EU countries are seeking new hardline measures to tackle it.</p> <p>\u201cPartnership deals\u201d that the EU and individual members states such as Italy have signed with countries such as Turkey, Tunisia and Libya, which are aimed at dissuading people from trying to reach Europe in the first place, are expected to be discussed.</p> <p>Fourteen member states, including France and Germany, have signed a letter demanding a tough \u201cparadigm shift\u201d on migration. Many want to see a significant increase in the \u201crate of returns\u201d.</p> <p>The government also intends to legislate to give border security forces \u201cenhanced\u201d powers.</p> <p>The border security, asylum and immigration bill, announced in the king\u2019s speech in July, will be the fourth piece of immigration legislation since 2022 as successive governments have attempted to tackle this issue.</p> <p>Refugee charities have warned Starmer that enforcement measures alone will fail to stop the boats and could lead to desperate people taking more dangerous and deadly journeys.</p> <p>Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: \u201cThe government must recognise that enforcement measures alone will not end this horrific trade. It must balance strong action against criminal networks with its commitment to uphold international rules that provide safety to those who need it most.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to the announcement, a spokesperson for the Conservatives said:\u201cKeir Starmer\u2019s announcement on tackling gangs will mean absolutely nothing without a deterrent.</p> <p>\u201cIf Starmer continues to ignore the need for a deterrent to stop migrants crossing the channel, there will be more deaths in the channel as more and more migrants continue to cross it.\u201d</p> <p>Starmer will chair his first monthly meeting of key cabinet ministers on illegal migration on Tuesday to make sure progress is made on the government mission.</p> <p>The Home Office said 230 people crossed the English Channel in small boats on Thursday. In October, 5,417 people made the crossing, the highest monthly figure since October 2022. The total for 2024 so far stands at 30,661. More than 50 people have died trying to cross the Channel this year, the highest since figures were first recorded in 2018.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Plans to tackle the \u201cnational security threat\u201d of people smugglers will receive an extra \u00a375m and a new team of detectives, Keir Starmer will announce on Monday, in the latest move to curb small boats in the Channel. The prime minister is expected to address irregular migration at two events this week amid concern within No 10 that the government must offer a viable alternative to the Conservatives\u2019 defunct Rwanda scheme. In a speech at the Interpol general assembly in Glasgow on Monday, he will say that the government will double funding to \u00a3150m for the Border Security Command, the enforcement agency launched by the Labour government this Summer. The money will be used to fund hi-tech surveillance equipment and 100 specialist investigators who will target criminals engaged in people smuggling, he will say. He will tell dignitaries and senior police from nearly 200 countries that the international community must tackle people smuggling gangs with the same tactics used to stop terrorism. \u201cThe world needs to wake up to the severity of this challenge. I was elected to deliver security for the British people. And strong borders are a part of that. But security doesn\u2019t stop at our borders. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing progressive about turning a blind eye as men, women and children die in the Channel,\u201d he will say. Starmer will tell the gathering that the counter-terror tactics could include the ability to shut down bank accounts, cut off internet access and seize evidence before offences take place. \u201cWe\u2019re taking our approach to counter-terrorism, which we know works, and applying it to the gangs, with our new Border Security Command. \u201cWe\u2019re ending the fragmentation between policing, Border Force and our intelligence agencies,\u201d he will say. Later in the week, he will hold talks on the boats crisis with European leaders, including the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, at a summit in Hungary. Despite irregular immigration into the EU being a fraction of what it was in 2015, EU countries are seeking new hardline measures to tackle it. \u201cPartnership deals\u201d that the EU and individual members states such as Italy have signed with countries such as Turkey, Tunisia and Libya, which are aimed at dissuading people from trying to reach Europe in the first place, are expected to be discussed. Fourteen member states, including France and Germany, have signed a letter demanding a tough \u201cparadigm shift\u201d on migration. Many want to see a significant increase in the \u201crate of returns\u201d. The government also intends to legislate to give border security forces \u201cenhanced\u201d powers. The border security, asylum and immigration bill, announced in the king\u2019s speech in July, will be the fourth piece of immigration legislation since 2022 as successive governments have attempted to tackle this issue. Refugee charities have warned Starmer that enforcement measures alone will fail to stop the boats and could lead to desperate people taking more dangerous and deadly journeys. Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: \u201cThe government must recognise that enforcement measures alone will not end this horrific trade. It must balance strong action against criminal networks with its commitment to uphold international rules that provide safety to those who need it most.\u201d Responding to the announcement, a spokesperson for the Conservatives said:\u201cKeir Starmer\u2019s announcement on tackling gangs will mean absolutely nothing without a deterrent. \u201cIf Starmer continues to ignore the need for a deterrent to stop migrants crossing the channel, there will be more deaths in the channel as more and more migrants continue to cross it.\u201d Starmer will chair his first monthly meeting of key cabinet ministers on illegal migration on Tuesday to make sure progress is made on the government mission. The Home Office said 230 people crossed the English Channel in small boats on Thursday. In October, 5,417 people made the crossing, the highest monthly figure since October 2022. The total for 2024 so far stands at 30,661. More than 50 people have died trying to cross the Channel this year, the highest since figures were first recorded in 2018.",
