We\u2019ll be back for match three at St Lucia on Thursday \u2013 until then, enjoy your week. Night! Will Jacks: \u201cI\u2019m very happy with the win, everyone knows the toss here is crucial, we bowled well and it got easier as the innings went on. And once you get a partnership going it is really hard to defend. Jos makes it look very easy, you just have so stand there and admire.\u201d \u201cPersonally I don\u2019t think about it too much, it doesn\u2019t matter that much to me, its just about being flexible.\" What do West Indies need to do? Win the toss says Steven Finn. But when Archer and Buttler are primed in peak gloriousness \u2013 it is going to be tricky. Powell: \u201cWe need someone in the top four, top five batting the majority of the overs, the next three games will give them an opportunity to do that. Unfortunately we have been off the mark in all three departments in the first two games, hopefully we will be ready in St Lucia. Our destiny is still in our hands.\u201d \u201cA bit scratchy to start with\u201d he says. Not for long though Jos. He speaks well about Jacks, about the team, about Mousley, \u201cOne of his biggest attributes is his character, I like that.\u201d He does though looks a little bit like someone whose been told to smile more. Steven Finn is raving about Jos Buttler: \u201cThe thing about bowling at him is that usually if you\u2019re bowling at a T20 player there is a weakness but, like his hero AB de Villiers, his ability to hit and ball off line and length is incredible.\u201d A top-notch victory for England that \u2013 a perfect pairing for Saturday\u2019s stroll \u2013 despite losing Salt to the first ball of the chase. Buttler was magnificent, Jacks a worthy foil, and Livingstone the cherry on the cake. With ball \u2013 Saqib was fantastic, Mousley a revelation, Livi more than useful and Archer 90mph trouble. 14.5 overs: England 161-3 ( Livingstone 23, Bethell 3) Livingstone crunches Shepherd for four with a flourish and bended knee. Four more next ball, squarer and with heart. Shepherd folds his arms in disgust. And that\u2019s the win with six flamed over extra cover! England go 2-0 up, with three games to play. 13th over: England 145-3 ( Livingstone 8, Bethell 2) Debutant Terrance Hinds with a Malinga-type sling. Four byes past the keeper, two wides and a peachy wide yorker edged for four by Livingstone. England are in touching distance now. 12th over: England 132-3 ( Livingstone 2, Bethell 1)Two wickets in the over, but surely too late? England need 27 from 42. Dropped the ball before, but snaffled this time going for another biggie. He throws his bat in the air in frustration \u2013 but what a premium steak of an innings. Jacks throws the bat at one way wide of off stump but Forde catches at the second attempt, finishing with his legs straight in front of him like a vest and pants clad* primary school child in a PE lesson.* (1980s reference) 11th over: England 127-1 (Jacks 38, Buttler 83) Chase, shiny head reflecting the floodlights. There\u2019s a close call with a leaping long off, but Buttler\u2019s flat snap brings six more. Another is scorched like Scottie Scheffler on a good day . And he scores in the final point by almost removing Chase\u2019s ankles with a searing straight drive for four. 18 from the over. 10th over: England 109-1 (Jacks 37, Buttler 66) Thus refreshed, Buttler continues his work. He drives Terrance for four like a first bite of a fresh mango and then stands deep in his crease and picks up six over long on. Jacks finishes the over by spotting the slower ball and whacking it for four through the offside. England need 50 off 54 and are a-cruising. 10th over: England 94-1 (Jacks 33, Buttler 55) A first fifty at No.3 for Butler, who swipes six from the unfortunate Chase like a man who knows how good he is. God, wouldn\u2019t it be great to be as good at something as he is at swiping cricket balls. Drinks! 9th over: England 78-1 (Jacks 31, Buttler 46) I\u2019m afraid West Indies are having a bit of a Jos-ing here. First a one handed four straight, then a fly flay up and over for six \u2013 bouncing off the solar panels. He signals for a banana \u2013 or at least I think he does. A pause while we get new balls. Then Motie must try again. Restricts him to one from the last three balls, which is more than respectable. 8th over: England 66-1 (Jacks 30, Buttler 35) A thick edge for four, not pretty but productive, from Buttler. A scattering of singles. 7th over: England 60-1 (Jacks 29, Buttler 30) Motie restores some sanity. 6th over: England 56-1 (Jacks 27, Buttler 28) Shepherd with the last over of the power play. Doesn\u2019t work quite as Powell would have hoped as Jacks and Buttler play pin ball. First Jacks slaps over extra cover for four, then Buttler clubs one over backward point for four more before flaying Shepherd down the ground and over the sightscreen for six, before finally scooping for boundaries. like a man swatting a fly. A vintage bit of Buttlering 5th over: England 35-1 (Jacks 22, Buttler 12) Forde throws down the stumps as England go for a quick single, but Buttler just makes his ground. Jacks leans back as if lowering the sun lounger and sends Hosein down the ground for six. Nine from the over. 4th over: England 26-1 (Jacks 14, Buttler 11) Forde not letting Buttler get bat on ball \u2013 three dots, but he drives past extra cover with typical steel to break the deadlock. Four more, if more riskily. 3rd over: England 18-1 (Jacks 14, Buttler 3) Hosein is a serious-looking fellow and continues with his work in a serious manner. Jacks picks up four more but Mark Butcher says West Indies won\u2019t mind that as he made himself lots of room. 2nd over: England 11-1 (Jacks 9, Buttler 1) Not much easier from Forde, who has the ball swinging. JAcks has a couple of near misses just in front of slip and short fine leg before picking up a couple of dreamy boundaries in his audition for the opening spot. 1st over: England 2-1 (Jacks 1, Buttler 1) Gorgeous from Hosein, Buttler nearly done for his second duck in a row but just gets his bat down in time. This could get tasty. Hello there Guy Hornsby. \u201cSo happy to see Dan Mousley get his first wicket tonight, even more so with the pace on Yorker. It\u2019s just an incredible weapon. After Jacob Bethell last night, it\u2019s great to see the new kids on the block get amongst the action. \u201cBut even more so than that, seeing Saqib Mahmood bowl so well is so heartening after the appalling luck he\u2019s had. You hope he\u2019s got a good run of fitness coming, because he\u2019s the real deal.\u201d Agreed on every count! Salt flays with abandon at the first ball of the innings and picks out King at extra-cover who juggles but holds on at the second attempt. From conquering hero to big fat zero. The West Indies are tactics-ing in a final circle, the heavy roller is journeying up and down. Salt and Jacks are in the middle \u2013 the chase begins. \u201cNicholas Pooran sounds like 12th century Pope to me.\u201d taps Gary Naylor. \u201cShould I get out more?\" Gary, I couldn\u2019t possibly advise (Google tells me there have been five Pontiffs called Nicholas) A good recovery there from West Indies in not easy conditions \u2013 interesting to see what the pitch will do as the Bajan evening sets in. Were England a little wayward? How about I tell you in 20 overs\u2019 time. 20th over: West Indies 158-8 (Forde 13, Terrance 5) A wicket with Mousley\u2019s first ball, but 14 from the over as five wides fly down the leg side, and Hinds and Forde both pick up a boundary each. England will need a run rate of 7.90, with some helpful conditions for the bowlers, a soggy outfield and an extra spin option up West Indies\u2019 sleeve. Can\u2019t nail the yorker this time but it doesn\u2019t matter as Shepherd goes for broke but can\u2019t clear mid-wicket! 19th over: West Indies 143-7 (Shepherd 27, Forde 9) Curran gets the penultimate over. Starts with a couple of wides from around the wicket. Shepherd smokes him down the ground for four, Forde joins in, with Englandunable to prevent it powering over the rope, either with the initial dive, or the riccochet. A third four driven with a side of oysters by Forde. Seventeen from it. 18th over: West Indies 126-7 (Shepherd 16, Forde 0) A wicket maiden for Rashid \u2013 though there are four byes, which Saqib tries to stop and somehow avoids serious injury as he slides and huge chunk of the wet outfield comes away with him. The same happens to Overton as he lands whilst catching Motie. Motie chugs for glory, but can only scythe Rashid up and Overton collects at long on. 17th over: West Indies 122-6 (Shepherd 16, Motie 9) Buttler beckons back Jofra, and West Indies take 12 from his over. Archer heavy with the slower balls \u2013 one gets edged by a fly-me-wide Shepherd for four, another flies past Buttler at cover, who watches it go. Archer not so happy about that. 16th over: West Indies 110-6 (Shepherd 4, Motie 8) Mousley gets his first international wicket \u2013 and what a face for the pinboard -but is then carved for two fours by the irrespresible Motie. Powell gives Mosely a filthy look as he realises he\u2019s been yorked by a dart. A corking innings, but crucially not there at the end. 15th over: West Indies 101-5 (Powell 43, Shepherd 4) Powell flaps a hankerchief and miscues six off Rashid, a delicate paddle for a couple more here, a short ball cut for four there. Powell takes 16 off five balls. 14th over: West Indies 85-5 (Powell 27, Shepherd 4) Another over of Mousley\u2019s darts, Shepherd picks up four from a freakish edge. 13th over: West Indies 80-5 (Powell 25) Powell casually frying pans Livingstone onto the roof for six. The umpire comes out with a bag of balls. A handful of singles follow then a huge appeal for lbw against Rutherford. Umpire says no, third umpire says YES YES YES! A classic offbreak that would have knocked down middle. 12th over: West Indies 71-4 (Powell 18, Rutherford 0) Just one from Mousley\u2019s over of allsorts. 11th over: West Indies 70-4 (Powell 17) First ball after drinks and Livingstone is slain for four through midwicket. Pooran switch hits a single before falling onto his nose. A ripper next ball bamboozles Powell \u2013 then Pooran is done by corking offie that draws him down the pitch, and Salt does the rest. Livingstone is glee on legs. 10th over: West Indies 63-3 (Pooran 13, Powell 9) Curran keeping it tight once more, West Indies doing nothing too hasty as they aim to build a platform. Time for DRINKS at the halfway point in the innings. 9th over: West Indies 60-3 (Pooran 12, Powell 9) Powell sweeps consecutive balls from Rashid with surprising delicacy for a man mountain. Hello there Showbizguru, \u201cOBO saves the day again. In the perfect beach bar in St Maarten enjoying a \u2018 Dutch \u2018 cheroot and Happy Hour margarita ($5 a pop) and the tellies are all showing yee-haa American football. Could be worse I suppose...\u201d I\u2019m glad we\u2019re here with a big juicy cherry for your perfect beach bar. Room for any rogue OBO-ers? 8th over: West Indies 54-3 (Pooran 10, Powell 5) Curran examines the bottom of his bowling boots and scampers in. On the button immediately with a maiden. Marcus Trescothick scribbles in his notebook on the balcony with one of those click-clack biros with the different colour inks. 7th over: West Indies 54-3 (Pooran 10, Powell 5) It\u2019s Adil Rashid time, royal blue towel tucked in his waistband. Powell has his cap on in readiness. A wide wanders down the legside and otherwise West Indies fairly comfortably rotate the strike. 6th over: West Indies 44-3 (Pooran 5, Powell 1) A loose ball for Saqib puts four leg byes on the board for West Indies but a tight over otherwise and nearly removes Pooran\u2019s ankles with a glorious yorker, which is well dug out. 5th over: West Indies 39-3 (Pooran 5, Powell 0) Pooran picks up four first ball, but Jofra follows up with five immaculate pencil point dots. 4th over: West Indies 35-3 (Pooran 1, Powell 0) Saqib gets his reward after sending down two wides and being driven gloriously by Chase for two fours. This is not easy bowling to face. Saqib, who has been struggling with the swinging ball, is suddenly pitch perfect with a wobble-seaming beauty that fires into Chase\u2019s pad. Chase reviews with a frown, but the ball is trimming the top of the stumps, it is umpire\u2019s call, and off he must trudge. 3rd over: West Indies 25-2 (Pooran 1, Chase 5) Lewis swivel-pulls Archer\u2019s second ball for four, but that\u2019s his lot as he immediately is bewitched by some kind of sorcery. Chase nearly falls first ball, slicing another lifter through the slips but just high enough that even Overton on take-off couldn\u2019t grab it. There is, say the commentators, dampness in the pitch. A brute of a delivery from Archer, spitting nastily. Lewis, as he twists to avoid it, gets a brush of glove on ball which then plops into Salt\u2019s gloves 2nd over: West Indies 16-1 (Pooran 1, Lewis 4) Saqib continues to make the ball sing, drawing in King and swinging the white ball with gusto, down the legside for five wides, then wide on the off side, before crashing into Lewis\u2019 pads. A third wide before the over is out. King has a wild hoick and the ball flies up, up and suddenly drops to a back-pedalling Liam Livingstone at mid-off. 1st over: West Indies 6-0 (King 1, Lewis 4). Jofra from the Joel Garner end, in his trimmed trousers and loose shirt. Gets movement straight away, troubling Lewis in particular. He picks up four by dabbing through where second slip might have been chewing his nails \u2013 not entirely sure that was on purpose. Out come the players, Archer is drying his hands in the dust \u2013 and off we go. Terrance Hinds has just been handed his first West Indies cap at the ripe age of 32. And very pleased he looks too. They\u2019ve had lots of rain in Barbados and the outfield is soggy. A different pitch today \u2013 but it looks just as perky and grass-bare, not many cracks. In the words of Brathwaite: bowlers beware! Saqib Mahmood is in a bucket hat channelling his inner Burnage after yesterday\u2019s four wickets. \u201cWe don\u2019t make it too complicated, keep it as simple as possible, their batting order is pretty stacked.\u201d Carlos Brathwaite on what the West Indies unit could do to improve on Saturday\u2019s somewhat wayward performance: \u201cYesterday as a bowling unit, especially from the Malcolm Marshall End, the seamers gave too much width. Can you be a bit tighter, limit the damage early in the power play, put a bit more pressure on them in overs five and six, and pick up the wickets at the back end? Three changes: Matthew Forde replaces Shamar Joseph, Roston Chase swaps in for Shimron Hetmyer, while Terrance Hinds must pull on the injured Andre Russell\u2019s big boots. West Indies: 1 Brandon King, 2 Evin Lewis, 3 Nicholas Pooran (wk), 4 Sherfane Rutherford, 5 Rovman Powell (c), 6 Romario Shepherd, 7 Roston Chase, 8 Terrance Hinds, 9 Gudakesh Motie,10 Akeal Hosein, 11 Matthew Forde One change: Jofra Archer replaces Reece Topley. England: 1 Phil Salt (wk), 2 Will Jacks, 3 Jos Buttler (c), 4 Liam Livingstone, 5 Jacob Bethell, 6 Sam Curran, 7 Dan Mousley, 8 Jamie Overton, 9 Saqib Mahmood, 10 Adil Rashid, 11 Jofra Archer Buttler calls correctly, again. \u201cWe are going to bowl first again because we put in a good performance and want to repeat it.\u201d News on Reece Topley? \u201cHe\u2019s doing ok, he\u2019s going to miss today with Jofra Archer coming in but it doesn\u2019t look like anything serious.\u201d Why is he batting at No.3? \u201cAn opportunity to do something different and gives Jacks an opportunity to try it in the international game. We\u2019re having a look at the balance and see how it goes.\u201d The TNT studio is open. Someone give Steven Finn and Sam Billings a chair. Good evening/afternoon/morning, wherever you are. We roll into this second T20, of a five-match series, with the scorch marks from England\u2019s smokin victory last night still on the grass. Phil Salt (103) and Jacob Bethell (58), two of England\u2019s bombastic Barbados boys, ensured that England cruised past West Indies with 3.1 overs left. Can they do it again? Play starts at 8pm GMT, do join us to find out.",

During the show Ora gave an emotional tribute to the One Direction singer Liam Payne, saying: \u201cLiam Payne was one of the kindest people that I knew. He had the biggest heart and was always the first person to offer help in any way that he could. \u201cHe brought so much joy to every room he walked into and he left such a mark on the world.\u201d Taylor Swift led the nominations, making an appearance in seven categories and coming away with four awards, including best artist and best video for Fortnight, her duet with Post Malone. She has become the first musician to win best artist three times, ahead of two-time best artist winner Mendes, who picked up an award this year for best Canadian artist. Swift, whose Eras tour has been the most lucrative in music history, also saw off other top female artists in a female-dominated lineup, also featuring Charli XCX and Billie Eilish. Homegrown artists triumphed too, with Raye winning best UK artist, Liam Gallagher picking up best rock artist and Calvin Harris winning best electronic artist. Best song predictably went to the song of the summer, Espresso by Sabrina Carpenter, beating Eilish\u2019s Birds of a Feather, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Texas Hold \u2019Em, Beautiful Things by Benson Boone, Chappell Roan\u2019s Good Luck, Babe! and We Can\u2019t Be Friends by Ariana Grande. Pet Shop Boys, who picked up the Pop Pioneer award for their 40 years in the music industry, also performed, alongside a local orchestra, the Manchester Camerata. The duo are the most successful in UK music history with Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe listed in the Guinness Book of Records, achieving 44 UK Top 30 singles, including 22 Top 10 hits and four No 1s, 15 UK Top 10 studio albums and sold-out shows in 63 countries. The hip-hop legend Busta Rhymes \u2013 with an unlikely connection to the north-west of England \u2013 took home a lifetime achievement award. The musician previously spoke of spending two summers with his Aunt Velma in Morecambe. \u201cThat\u2019s a fact,\u201d he told the BBC last year. \u201cI\u2019d never seen a white and a black person go [to school] together until I came here.\u201d Accepting the award, which was presented by the British rapper Little Simz, Rhymes said: \u201cThis is my first time here. I\u2019ve never got an award from MTV before. Thirty-four years of professionally recording, this is the first time I\u2019m getting an award from MTV. It feels fucking incredible.\u201d The 12-time Grammy nominee thanked his mother, who he described as his best friend and hero. Rhymes also performed a medley of his greatest hits to the crowd of 23,500, at the UK\u2019s largest indoor music venue. Broadcast live to more than 150 countries across the world, the EMAs are watched closely by the music industry as they often give a hint of which artists are lined up for success at the Grammys. The EMAs were the last in a week-long series of events in Manchester under the umbrella of MTV music week. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said: \u201cFor a long time we\u2019ve been saying that Manchester is the UK\u2019s capital of music, with a rich musical heritage stretching back decades that has helped build a vibrant, diverse music scene that continues to flourish today. \u201cHaving the MTV EMAs, music week and some of the biggest names in pop music like Rita Ora in Manchester not only helps to strengthen our claim, but it also provides a huge boost to our music industry and the wider economy.\u201d",

For the first time, the unnamed Metropolitan police officer who shot and killed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/menezes\">Jean Charles de Menezes</a> speaks out publicly, giving a raw and detailed interview about what happened on the morning of 22 July, 2005, and in the years that followed. De Menezes was an electrician from Brazil, taking the London Underground to work from Stockwell station. An innocent man, he was wrongly suspected of being a suicide bomber. He was shot once in the shoulder and seven times in the head.</p> <p>Over two gripping episodes, this documentary lays the foundations for its story and then unpicks every aspect of it, examining each element carefully, critically and with compassion, from a distance of 20 years later. Part one is all atmosphere, eerily recreating what ITV News producer Neil Garrett calls \u201ca febrile time\u201d in the city. London was still celebrating the decision to award it the 2012 Olympic Games when, on 7 July, four suicide bombers detonated explosives on the transport system, killing 52 and injuring more than 700 people.</p> <p>The film effectively details the palpable nervousness and anxiety that permeated London during that period. People travelling to work were already ill at ease, frightened and jittery, when, two weeks later, another four attackers tried to detonate suicide bombs on public transport, failing in their attempt to commit a second act of mass murder only because the explosives did not go off as planned.</p> <p>Although the exclusive is the interview with the unnamed firearms officer, there are many other extraordinary interviews here. Angus Campbell was a fireman in 2005, who found himself in a tube carriage during one of those failed detonations; ever the emergency worker, he describes walking towards the attacker, who appeared to be burned. The CCTV footage of this is remarkable and, though nobody was hurt but the bomber himself, it is quietly terrifying.</p> <p>The narrative becomes more comprehensive and layered through the accounts of Tony Blair, the former prime minister, Richard Walton, the former head of counter terrorism, and Douglas McKenna, the senior investigating officer for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/dec/16/london-suicide-bombers-lose-appeal-human-rights-court\">21 July attacks</a> at the time. There are also interviews, mostly in part two, with passengers on the same carriage as De Menezes, who provide a broader sense of the fear and uncertainty that followed the shooting, and explain the origins of the false story that De Menezes was running from officers and had vaulted the ticket barriers. Notably, neither the much criticised former Met commissioner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/cressida-dick\">Cressida Dick</a>, nor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/ian-blair\">Ian Blair</a>, the Met commissioner at that time, appear.</p> <p>If the first episode seems to have a gaping absence at its heart, which is De Menezes himself, this is remedied in part two, when we hear from his friend and colleague about this \u201csimple\u201d and \u201cshy\u201d man who loved London. It also untangles the mess made by the Met in the aftermath of the shooting. The inconsistencies and elisions offered in official statements were memorably exposed by ITV News, via Garrett, who was arrested for his troubles. Though this is much more sympathetic to the individual officers, acting on orders which appear to have been confused, confusing and chaotic, the perennial question of trust in the Metropolitan Police as an institution is once again brought to the surface.</p> <p>It is the senior firearms officer who ties it all together. He reads from his diary at the time, provides details that are simultaneously matter-of-fact and utterly horrifying, and explains why he feels compelled to speak about his role in what Tony Blair describes as \u201ca tragic accident\u201d and a \u201cterrible mistake\u201d. The officer wants people to understand why he pulled the trigger and, certainly, this documentary is a reminder of misinformation that lingers, and assumptions that might be made too readily about what went so very wrong. He lays out how he and his team found themselves in a position where they felt it necessary to shoot to kill: \u201cEverything told me that we were going to die.\u201d He also painstakingly recalls the aftermath, that day and in the longer term, though he is delicate about his own suffering and careful to note that it does not begin to compare to what De Menezes\u2019 family have been forced to endure.</p> <p>What starts as an intimate account of the shooting by the marksman, then, broadens out into an examination of the Metropolitan Police, and its behaviour as an institution, during that tense and troubled time. Perhaps the film rushes this part a little, in favour of that febrile atmosphere, but it is compelling throughout. De Menezes\u2019 story will be revisited in dramatic form by a limited series for Disney, which was announced last year, but this comprehensive documentary allows those who were there, some of them, to give their version of events.</p> <p>\u2022 Shoot to Kill: Terror on the Tube aired on Channel 4 and is available online.</p>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from me this evening. Rylance awaits. Thanks for your company, we\u2019ll be back tomorrow to bring you the action from day two in Turin where a certain Mr Alcaraz will be in action. Arrivederci! Sinner and Fritz get on the board. Here\u2019s how they stand after Day 1 in Turin. Sinner speaks: I\u2019m very happy, there were some unforced errors early on but I knew at some point my tennis would arrive. I\u2019m pleased but my serve will need to improve. The energy of the crowd is great, the welcome was very warm and felt amazing. Thank you everyone.\u201d Sinner chalks up his first win of the finals, de Minaur had his moments but made too many errors trying to hit big shots in order to stay with Sinner and then failed to step up and put any real pressure on the Sinner second serve. The Aussie showed his tenacity at times and will look to build on that in the rest of his matches. Sinner starts with an ACE and follows up with a one-two punch of massive forehand and velveteen backhand volley. 30-0 to the Italian. Here comes three match points\u2026 ACE down the line to finish off! The players embrace at the net and shake hands with the umpire. Sinner got the job done simply enough without being at his best, which is probably quite a scary prospect for his opponents this week. Sinner 6-3, 5-4 de Minaur* Sinner nearly pulls off a lob from out of position wide on the backhand side but the ball just lands long, much de Minaur\u2019s relief. The crowd now getting more behind the Aussie as they want to see more tennis this evening. de Minaur wins a cat and mouse rally and Sinner then plonks long twice in quick succession to relinquish the game. He\u2019ll have to serve for it. *Sinner 6-3, 5-3 de Minaur Sinner shows his deft side with a lovely sliced backhand drop shot that has de Minaur scrabbling from the back of the court. He holds comfortably to go one game away, can de Minaur make him serve it out at least? Sinner 6-3, 4-3 de Minaur * Maybe Jannik Sinner is a fan of Mark Rylance and his endless hat doffing and candlelit politicking? We could be wrapped up in time for Wolf Hall\u2019s long anticipated return here. As I type that the big man prangs an easy backhand wide to let de Minaur off the hook. Rylance\u2019s Cromwell would never do such a thing. This is all getting a bit Alan Partridge. de Minaur hangs in there and holds, the DJ cranks the Eurythmics\u2019 Sweet Dreams. Alan is that you? *Sinner 6-3, 4-2 de Minaur Spirited stuff from de Minaur who chases the ball around the court like a terrier. The players\u2019 sneakers squeaking like a moshpit of mice as the rally goes deeper and deeper. Now then, de Minaur has his man 0-30 down. Big serve needed, and delivered. 15-30. And again, Sinner serve out wide and then followed up with a driving forehand to level things up. 30-30. Sinner finding his serving boots when he needs to. 40-30. Gah! Sinner then messes up a simple overhead volley, an absolute lollipop to give de Minaur another slurp at deuce. Bish and Bosh. Sinner escapes the game and consolidates the break. Sinner 6-3, 3-2 de Minaur* After a lengthy delay we are back. The Sinner charge is halted by a long rally that ends in the Italian splooting one long. He still has two break points\u2026 make that one as a backhand catches the net. Deuce! de Minaur gets level with a beefy serve down the T. Sinner has him on the hop next point though and now has break point on second serve\u2026 he returns with a punishing forehand at de Minaur\u2019s toes and seals the break at the fourth time of asking. Sinner breaks! Sinner starts to make his move in the second. de Minaur struggles to contain him in the rallies and ends up going for too much too soon, splatting a forehand wide and then getting pinned by a thunderous passing shot at the net. Sinner has 0-40 but there is a short delay whilst there is a medical situation in the stands. *Sinner 6-3, 2-2 de Minaur Sinner sends down his third ACE to close out a quick and painless game to level things up. Sinner 6-3, 1-2 de Minaur* Sinner cranks up the pressure with some stonking ball striking. He has de Minaur at 0-30 but again the Aussie shows his resolve with three dogged points in a row. Have some of that! de Minaur stays with Sinner on the baseline and then unleashes an exocet forehand of his own that Sinner can\u2019t keep a lid on. This second set has seen the quality and intensity cranked. de Minaur holds! Liquid Tennis *Sinner 6-3, 1-1 de Minaur Hold that thought, de Minaur strikes back immediately, hustling and harrying to break the tall Italian\u2019s serve. Here we go with the second set Sinner 6-3, 1-0 de Minaur* Sinner breaks in the first game of the second set, the wheels could come off quite quickly here for de Minaur. de Minaur will be disappointed that he got ahead with the early break and then played a loose couple of games straightaway to hand the initiative back. Sinner then moved through the gears and the set flew out of sight in a flash. There\u2019s a kerfuffle as a few members of the crowd try to take a sneaky picture but with the flash still on. Duh. Sinner pays it never mind and goes to 30-0. de Minaur then takes one of the longer rallies for the first time in the match. He\u2019s known for being able to hunt down everything like a truffle hungry hog and showed it for the first time there. Tenacious de Minaur. Sinner lands a tricky backhand volley to bring up set point and there it is \u2013 a forehand shank on the run sees the Italian and world numero uno take the first set. Sinner 5-3 de Minaur* de Minaur is desperate to hold serve, if only to give him some momentum for the next set. He tries to go big on the second serve, too big, and coughs up a double fault for 15-15. Touch! That\u2019ll do his confidence the world of good, de Minaur stretches low with Andrex soft hands to pull off a Becker-esque volley. Beautiful. He holds and so Sinner will serve for the first set. *Sinner 5-2 de Minaur Sinner on the verge of the first set after holding to love. de Minaur started brightly and got the early break but since then it has been one way traffic with Sinner finding his range and the Aussie struggling to stay with him in the rallies. Sinner 4-2 de Minaur* Big game for de Minaur incoming. He needs to hold firm and stay with Sinner and his pounding groundstrokes. Two loose backhands in a row from Sinner help him to 30-0. A rushed approach from de Minaur goes long to give Sinner a sniff. A couple of MONSTER forehands turn the game on its head and give Sinner a chance of a double-break. de Minaur squeaks to deuce but then hits a soft forehand halfway up the net. Advantage Sinner. There\u2019s the double break! de Minaur was asking for trouble by floating up some loopy backhands that get absolutely pongoed back by Sinner. Too hot too handle eventually and the Aussie sees the game snatched off him. *Sinner 3-2 de Minaur Sinner races to 40-0, making de Minaur scrap back and forth the bassline, grinding him down and then pulling the trigger. That\u2019ll do - a big serve out wide sees de Minaur cloth his return into the net. The crowd whoop their man after the early scare. Sinner 2-2 de Minaur * (*Denotes current server) de Minaur slams down an ACE to go 15-0 up. The crowd come to life as Sinner forces his opponent to punch long to take it to 15-30. A battle of the backhand slices sees Sinner get two break points of his own. Sublime! A cross court passing shot whistles past the approaching de Minaur and lands an inch inside the tramline. Sinner breaks back immediately and gives it the old \u2018Henmania\u2019 mini fist pump. *Sinner 1-2 de Minaur Rallies elongating, there\u2019s been plenty of debate about the weight of the balls this year and how they are conducive to even longer rallies. Time for Sinner to feel some pressure as de Minaur gets him to 30-30 and then forces the error to carve out the first break point of the night! He\u2019s got it, Sinner approaches the net but plonks a backhand into the tramline. de Minaur has an early break! Game on. Sinner 1-1 de Minaur* de Minaur feels the heat of Sinner\u2019s groundstrokes straight away and fluffs a backhand slice long. Nervy stuff from the Aussie who wriggles off the 30-30 hook with an ace and then breathes a sigh of relief as Sinner slams a backhand into the net cord. He\u2019s on the board. First Set: *Sinner 1-0 de Minaur (*Denotes current server) Sinner rattles off his first game to love with a couple of big serves and short rallies. A confident start from the home man. Over to you Alex\u2026 We\u2019ll have some warm ups and then it\u2019ll be game time. 23 year old Sinner is cranking up his lissom limbs in a blue polo shirt and white baseball hat. 25 year old de Minaur is in blue too but he\u2019s got a navy cap on backwards as is his wont. The Aussie is a good three inches shorter than the 6ft3in Sinner who is about to put his impressive wingspan to good use by serving first. Let\u2019s play! The fantastically named Renaud Lichtenstein is umpiring this evening\u2019s match and there\u2019s a dance show with some heavy strobing taking place on court. The tv screens now show a bouncing tennis ball complete with heart beat sound effect booming around the stadium. It\u2019s all very razzle dazzle. Here are the players! They head out on court separately, de Minaur is warmly received and Sinner strolls on to court, across a massive picture of his own face to huge cheers and applause. The smartest dressed painter and decorators in Turin: The stadium is bathed in the sort of blue light that makes it look like a CSI unit are on the hunt for some incriminating forensics. I\u2019m half expecting Taggart to poke his head out and give a rollocking to a chap in a white boiler suit. The players are due out any moment. How it works: There are two groups of four in the round robin style tournament, with the semi-finals and final taking place next Saturday and Sunday. Sinner\u2019s group includes Russia\u2019s Daniil Medvedev, American Taylor Fritz and Australian debutant Alex de Minaur. Fritz got the better of a hot-headed and racket totalling Medvedev in straight sets earlier on: The other group will see 2024 French Open and Wimbledon champ Carlos Alcaraz up against Germany\u2019s Alexander Zverev, Norway\u2019s Casper Ruud and Russia\u2019s Andrey Rublev. I\u2019ve been enjoying the Paul Mescal-ification of the pre promo. Look at these fellas. Work it. That\u2019s before we get to the short shorts. Hello and welcome to the Inalpi Arena in Turin (by way of a sofa in south London) and the ATP World Tour Finals. We\u2019ve got a week of top notch tennis in store as the eight best singles players in the world go squeaky sneakered toe to squeaky sneakered toe in northern Italy. Novak Djokovic pulled out of the tournament last week with a decidedly vague \u201congoing injury\u201d and so there will be a new name on the trophy this year.

The curly fringed Italian\u2019s year has not been without controversy though, an ongoing doping dispute still lingers and threatens to take the shine off a gilded twelve months that has already seen him confirmed as the number one ranked player in the men\u2019s game come the end of the year. Tonight\u2019s opponent is Aussie Alex de Minaur, prince of the punishing rally and a dogged defender of the baseline who is capable of pilfering points against anyone on his day. He\u2019ll need to be at his best to take down Sinner this evening, their ATP head to head reads seven to zilch in favour of the Italian. We\u2019ll get into all that and more over the next few hours, drop me a line at the email on the left tramline of this page if you are tuning in, I\u2019ll be glad of your thwick thwocking thoughts and theories. The match is due to start at 7.30pm GMT (ish).",

Amorim signed off from Sporting on Sunday evening with a 4-2 win away at Braga, coming back from 2-0 down at half-time. He departs the Portuguese champions with a perfect record of 11 wins from 11 games in the Primeira Liga this season.</p> <p>Speaking after the win, Amorim turned his attentions to his new job. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult, I\u2019m not under any illusions,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel ready for the new challenge. I\u2019m not naive, I know it\u2019s going to be very different, very difficult. I\u2019m at peace now, I can focus on my new job and I\u2019m looking forward to starting tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>Amorim is the sixth permanent successor to Sir Alex Ferguson, who retired in May 2013, and takes over a team unbeaten in the last four under the caretaker manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, after Erik ten Hag\u2019s dismissal. Van Nistelrooy ended his tenure unbeaten, with three victories, the last of which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/10/manchester-united-leicester-premier-league-match-report\">Sunday\u2019s 3-0 win over Leicester</a> at Old Trafford.</p> <p>Whether Van Nistelrooy has a future under Amorim is yet to be determined. \u201cWe will learn what the further plan is now,\u201d he said. \u201cI am here to support the club and I want to continue that. I was told after this block of four matches, there will be communication towards you and your colleagues [about the future], so I expect to hear today [Sunday] or tomorrow [Monday].\u201d</p> <p>Bruno Fernandes, who scored United\u2019s opener against Leicester, said: \u201cRuud van Nistelrooy feels the club, he loves the club, he wants to bring joy to the players. He brought everyone with a smile to the games, he just wanted us to enjoy it. We wanted to say goodbye as a manager for him properly because he did good things for us.\u201d</p> <p>Of Amorim, Fernandes said: \u201cIt\u2019s a new era, a new manager means everything changes but what hasn\u2019t changed is that this club has to get back to where it belongs.\u201d</p> <p>Steve Cooper gave injury updates on the missing Jamie Vardy and Ricardo Pereira. \u201cJamie is a bit inconclusive, he picked up a knock to his back last week and hasn\u2019t been able to shake it off. We are still trying to work it out,\u201d the Leicester manager said. \u201cRicky is a more serious hamstring injury and is going to be ruled out for four months so that is a blow for him.\u201d</p>",

The 39-year-old Portuguese will travel to the club on Monday to begin his tenure but, while United expect the visa to be granted soon, it is unclear what duties Amorim can undertake until this occurs. With many United players away on international duty the wait for a visa should not materially affect Amorim\u2019s plans, as his ability to work with the full squad was always limited to starting on Thursday week, when all are expected back from matches with their respective international teams. Amorim signed off from Sporting on Sunday evening with a 4-2 win away at Braga, coming back from 2-0 down at half-time. He departs the Portuguese champions with a perfect record of 11 wins from 11 games in the Primeira Liga this season. Speaking after the win, Amorim turned his attentions to his new job. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult, I\u2019m not under any illusions,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel ready for the new challenge. I\u2019m not naive, I know it\u2019s going to be very different, very difficult. I\u2019m at peace now, I can focus on my new job and I\u2019m looking forward to starting tomorrow.\u201d Amorim is the sixth permanent successor to Sir Alex Ferguson, who retired in May 2013, and takes over a team unbeaten in the last four under the caretaker manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, after Erik ten Hag\u2019s dismissal. Van Nistelrooy ended his tenure unbeaten, with three victories, the last of which was Sunday\u2019s 3-0 win over Leicester at Old Trafford. Whether Van Nistelrooy has a future under Amorim is yet to be determined. \u201cWe will learn what the further plan is now,\u201d he said. \u201cI am here to support the club and I want to continue that. I was told after this block of four matches, there will be communication towards you and your colleagues [about the future], so I expect to hear today [Sunday] or tomorrow [Monday].\u201d Bruno Fernandes, who scored United\u2019s opener against Leicester, said: \u201cRuud van Nistelrooy feels the club, he loves the club, he wants to bring joy to the players. He brought everyone with a smile to the games, he just wanted us to enjoy it. We wanted to say goodbye as a manager for him properly because he did good things for us.\u201d Of Amorim, Fernandes said: \u201cIt\u2019s a new era, a new manager means everything changes but what hasn\u2019t changed is that this club has to get back to where it belongs.\u201d Steve Cooper gave injury updates on the missing Jamie Vardy and Ricardo Pereira. \u201cJamie is a bit inconclusive, he picked up a knock to his back last week and hasn\u2019t been able to shake it off. We are still trying to work it out,\u201d the Leicester manager said. \u201cRicky is a more serious hamstring injury and is going to be ruled out for four months so that is a blow for him.\u201d",

But her high-functioning anxiety was going unnoticed | Ashwini Padhi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The effects of this loss are particularly stark when the out-group is seen not only as different, or perhaps misguided, but also as indiscriminately threatening and hostile. At this point the cost to both the individual and society escalates and political, moral, ethical and material issues become urgent to address. However, there are also crucial psychological problems at stake. Whatever the causes of the original divide into enemies and allies, these divisions have hidden insidious mental health effects, as illustrated in the case of Meera.</p> <p>Meera came for therapy because she was experiencing anxiety and panic attacks. These seemed to escalate whenever there was the possibility that her husband Esai\u2019s family would come from India to visit. Meera and Esai had met each other while studying abroad and had married against the wishes of Meera\u2019s Hindu parents and Esai\u2019s Christian parents. Esai\u2019s parents had been caught up in the anti-Christian attacks that assailed India after 1998. Meera was aware of these but had not been personally touched by them. She acknowledged her in-laws\u2019 trauma but felt that they were projecting on to her their generalised resentment. Meera increasingly dreaded any interaction with her in-laws. Her belief that they saw her as the enemy legitimised her construing them as the enemy.</p> <p>In working with Meera, I was acutely aware of how many of us are embedded in trauma-drenched family and social histories and the enduring effects of these. When talking about her in-laws, Meera became visibly upset. Even while in the safety of my room she entered the fight-or-flight emergency state that a significant threat produces in us. </p> <p>While I had no doubt that there was a reality base to Meera\u2019s perceptions of her in-laws, it did not seem to me that the destruction of the marriage was at stake. However, in the fight-or-flight state that ensued when she contemplated their arrival, all the negatives pertaining to them were amplified and her sense of threat felt justified. Despite all the reassurances that Esai offered, Meera could only perceive her in-laws as being hellbent on the destruction of their marriage and the denigration of herself. This was despite their attempts to mend fences by offering to pay for an anniversary celebration and their financial contribution to the home Esai and Meera had bought.</p> <p>This amplification of negative perceptions of the \u201cenemy\u201d when in a fearful threat state not only interferes with more balanced perceptions; it amplifies negative emotions too. As <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/psychodynamic-psychotherapy-in-south-africa/introduction-cora-smith/9E527B7E1D1357037251397D04321674\">Cora Smith notes</a>, more realistic judgments fly out of the window of the mind and negative emotions come in the door of the heart. Anger, bitterness, hostility and the desire for revenge banish the positive emotions of empathy, compassion and kindness. This banishment has a psychic cost as most of us do not live easily with these negative emotions. We experience guilt and shame which can once again be covered over with anger.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/14/despite-having-a-loving-partner-mark-feels-unloveable-he-grew-up-in-a-world-that-shamed-him-for-who-he-is\">Despite having a loving partner, Mark feels unloveable. He grew up in a world that shamed him for who he is | Chris Cheers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While the source of Meera\u2019s anxiety was certainly fuelled by the real rejection she had experienced at the outset of her relationship with Esai, it was maintained by her more paranoid thoughts and the conflicted self-image that arose from her own hostile feelings. Her perception of her in-laws as a threat was intense, as was her struggle with her own \u201cugly\u201d emotions.</p> <p>The therapy process with Meera was multifaceted. Her significant anxiety disorder involved working at the physiological level with mindfulness and meditation. It also required work at the interpersonal level with Esai to gain his reassurance that the marriage could not be damaged by his parents. A trauma-informed approach was taken to address the intergenerational and historical issues, and both insight-oriented and cognitive approaches were used to challenge the damaging and self-reinforcing effects of us and them thinking. Gaining insight into the link between this mindset and her anguish and distress proved critical in ameliorating Meera\u2019s anxiety and restoring a degree of family harmony.</p> <p>Over time Meera slowly gained perspective and the ability to see two sides of the story. This provided considerable relief to Meera in regard to her generalised anxiety and difficult emotions, as well as her dread about family visits, which fortunately receded to the benefit of all.</p> <p><em>*Meera is a fictitious amalgam to exemplify many similar cases that we see.

We align ourselves with different sides of various wars. The negative effect of this on society is frequently noted. However, the more subtle and harmful effects on our mental health are often overlooked. There are some obvious advantages to in-group formation. From an evolutionary standpoint, it allows for both the protection and sharing of the group\u2019s resources. It fosters a sense of belonging and connection that promotes social cohesion and mental wellbeing. It is natural for the human mind to categorise and take mental shortcuts. Research highlights the cognitive benefits of this simplification, but it also warns of the costs \u2013 specifically the loss of complexity and nuance. The loss of our ability to think beyond yes or no, in or out, is the loss of a vital human capacity. The effects of this loss are particularly stark when the out-group is seen not only as different, or perhaps misguided, but also as indiscriminately threatening and hostile. At this point the cost to both the individual and society escalates and political, moral, ethical and material issues become urgent to address. However, there are also crucial psychological problems at stake. Whatever the causes of the original divide into enemies and allies, these divisions have hidden insidious mental health effects, as illustrated in the case of Meera. Meera came for therapy because she was experiencing anxiety and panic attacks. These seemed to escalate whenever there was the possibility that her husband Esai\u2019s family would come from India to visit. Meera and Esai had met each other while studying abroad and had married against the wishes of Meera\u2019s Hindu parents and Esai\u2019s Christian parents. Esai\u2019s parents had been caught up in the anti-Christian attacks that assailed India after 1998. Meera was aware of these but had not been personally touched by them. She acknowledged her in-laws\u2019 trauma but felt that they were projecting on to her their generalised resentment. Meera increasingly dreaded any interaction with her in-laws. Her belief that they saw her as the enemy legitimised her construing them as the enemy. In working with Meera, I was acutely aware of how many of us are embedded in trauma-drenched family and social histories and the enduring effects of these. When talking about her in-laws, Meera became visibly upset. Even while in the safety of my room she entered the fight-or-flight emergency state that a significant threat produces in us. While I had no doubt that there was a reality base to Meera\u2019s perceptions of her in-laws, it did not seem to me that the destruction of the marriage was at stake. However, in the fight-or-flight state that ensued when she contemplated their arrival, all the negatives pertaining to them were amplified and her sense of threat felt justified. Despite all the reassurances that Esai offered, Meera could only perceive her in-laws as being hellbent on the destruction of their marriage and the denigration of herself. This was despite their attempts to mend fences by offering to pay for an anniversary celebration and their financial contribution to the home Esai and Meera had bought. This amplification of negative perceptions of the \u201cenemy\u201d when in a fearful threat state not only interferes with more balanced perceptions; it amplifies negative emotions too. As Cora Smith notes, more realistic judgments fly out of the window of the mind and negative emotions come in the door of the heart. Anger, bitterness, hostility and the desire for revenge banish the positive emotions of empathy, compassion and kindness. This banishment has a psychic cost as most of us do not live easily with these negative emotions. We experience guilt and shame which can once again be covered over with anger. While the source of Meera\u2019s anxiety was certainly fuelled by the real rejection she had experienced at the outset of her relationship with Esai, it was maintained by her more paranoid thoughts and the conflicted self-image that arose from her own hostile feelings. Her perception of her in-laws as a threat was intense, as was her struggle with her own \u201cugly\u201d emotions. The therapy process with Meera was multifaceted. Her significant anxiety disorder involved working at the physiological level with mindfulness and meditation. It also required work at the interpersonal level with Esai to gain his reassurance that the marriage could not be damaged by his parents. A trauma-informed approach was taken to address the intergenerational and historical issues, and both insight-oriented and cognitive approaches were used to challenge the damaging and self-reinforcing effects of us and them thinking. Gaining insight into the link between this mindset and her anguish and distress proved critical in ameliorating Meera\u2019s anxiety and restoring a degree of family harmony. Over time Meera slowly gained perspective and the ability to see two sides of the story. This provided considerable relief to Meera in regard to her generalised anxiety and difficult emotions, as well as her dread about family visits, which fortunately receded to the benefit of all. *Meera is a fictitious amalgam to exemplify many similar cases that we see.

Indeed, half the couples got a two-point spread of scores. <strong>Craig Revel Horwood</strong> gave out several sevens, while his colleagues kept reaching for their nine and 10 paddles. Sanity needs to be restored as we enter the business end of the contest.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-673112528f088b29b8c433e8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-10T20:07:23.147Z\">8.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Nancy will be much missed</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Shayne\u2019s elimination also means the exit of his pro partner. Chinese-born Latin champion and all-round firecracker <strong>Nancy Xu</strong> has enjoyed another strong series. She\u2019s had a celebrity partner for four series, reaching the semi-final twice - with <strong>Rhys Stephenson </strong>and <strong>Will Mellor</strong>. Being first out with <strong>Les Dennis</strong> last year was her only flop.</p> <p>Nancy did well to steer Shayne this far, especially considering those three dance-offs. She clearly supported him well during his struggles with trolls and unpopularity. Nancy deserves a strong partner and a good run next year.</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-10T20:23:31.367Z\">at 8.23pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-673112078f088b29b8c433e7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-10T20:06:29.797Z\">8.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pete and Jamie can thank their popularity</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>He\u2019s the lowest-scoring celebrity left in the contest by far, averaging 25.6 points - nearly five points per dance fewer than the eliminated <strong>Shayne Ward</strong>. TOWIE alumnus <strong>Pete Wicks</strong> can therefore thank public support for making it past the contest\u2019s midway mark, let alone all the way to Blackpool.</p> <p>Dancing a Couple\u2019s Choice came at the right time for Pete. His contemporary routine, dedicated to his late nanna Doreen, was a heartstring-tugger. It didn\u2019t deserve a vastly inflated perfect 10 from <strong>Shirley Ballas</strong>, who as head judge should have known better, but a score of 36 took Pete to the dizzy heights of joint third on the scoreboard and helped ensure his safety.</p> <p>As a performance novice who has embraced playing characters, steadily improved and fallen in love with dance, Pete has been on the trademarked Strictly \u201cjourney\u201d. He\u2019s committed, trains hard and is smartly drilled by his partner, Polish pro <strong>Jowita Przystal</strong>, with whom he\u2019s formed the tight \u201cTeam Petita\u201d. His dry sense of humour has endeared him to viewers. Barring a miraculous leap in quality, however, he deserves to bow out before the end of November.</p> <p>The other big sigh of relief should come from <strong>Jamie Borthwick</strong>. He\u2019s suffered a slump in form over the past two weeks and was joint bottom of last night\u2019s scoreboard alongside Shayne. EastEnders fans must have hit the voting lines but Jamie needs to arrest the decline fast.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-673111d38f088b29b8c433e5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-10T20:05:17.699Z\">8.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Gender balance redressed</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The field was beginning to get uncomfortably male-heavy, with six celebrity men outnumbering the three remaining women by two to one.

He was bookies\u2019 second favourite for elimination this week behind <strong>Shayne Ward</strong>, scored a mere two points more on Saturday night and squeaked past him in only the second split dance-off decision of the series.</p> <p>Sure, he has great musicality and nimble feet for a big fella but Wynne\u2019s continuing run in the series is largely down to his dance partner <strong>Katya Jones</strong>. As arguably the most creative choreographer among the pros, Katya puts together clever routines, works around his abilities and body type, and consistently delivers routines with wow factor.</p> <p>Wynne once looked an outside bet for the final but the \u201chandgate\u201d controversy has dented his popularity, while his scores have hit a plateau in the early 30s. Katya will need all her tricks to keep him in the contest for more than a couple of weeks.</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-10T20:24:21.263Z\">at 8.24pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6731110d8f08a0d8bfbd386c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-10T20:03:21.183Z\">8.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Third time unlucky for Shayne</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Very few Strictly celebrities survive a third dance-off. So it proved for <strong>Shayne Ward</strong>. He\u2019d comfortably seen off <strong>Nick Knowles </strong>and<strong> Dr Punam Krishan</strong> over the past month but <strong>Wynne Evans</strong> provided sterner opposition. Even then, Shayne came within a within a whisker of edging him out in the eliminator.</p> <p>It\u2019s been a strange contest for the pop star-turned-actor. He looked like a dancer packed with potential and had charisma on the floor yet never quite convinced. His highlights came when playing his music heroes. His <strong>Elvis waltz</strong> and <strong>Beatles quickstep</strong> notched his highest scores. Otherwise, he seemed to overthink, tighten up and become hesitant. Having been trolled for perceived cockiness early in the series, he often came across as needy for approval \u2013 although he\u2019s clearly a decent chap, as those gracious closing comments demonstrated.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t connect with voting viewers, hence those three dance-offs. The slow rumba, always technically tricky and exposing for celebrity males, came along at the wrong time. Manchester-born Shayne would have been desperate to reach Blackpool but it wasn\u2019t to be. A case of what might have been.</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-10T20:25:01.846Z\">at 8.25pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6731107c8f08a0d8bfbd3865\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-10T20:00:59.450Z\">8.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Team Shancy\u2019s last dance</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As the eliminated couple take a final twirl around the dancefloor to the strains of Don\u2019t Dream It\u2019s Over by Crowded House (tune!), the credits roll and their castmates crowd in for cuddles.</p> <p>Please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments.</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-10T20:28:08.415Z\">at 8.28pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6731104d8f08a089b90bc59b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-10T19:58:50.531Z\">7.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Nancy returns the compliment</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>His pro partner <strong>Nancy Xu </strong>says: \u201cI\u2019m beyond proud of this partnership.

Intense and hawt with a strong line to finish.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>Do I Wanna Know? by Arctic Monkeys. The 2003 indie-rock banger is suitably dramatic and moody, built around a stomping guitar riff. It\u2019s often used by the band to open their shows.

The song means a lot to Pete Wicks, since it was the favourite song of his beloved nanna, Doreen, and was played at her funeral in 2022. He said this week: \u201cShe was my best mate and I wish she was here to watch me on Strictly,. This is my way of having her with me. I\u2019ve spent more time crying than dancing this week.\u201d Aww. For the first time, he\u2019s not playing a character, just being himself. \u201cIt\u2019s the most vulnerable I\u2019ve ever been in 11 years on TV,\u201d he says. He\u2019s the lowest scoring celebrity left in the competition and made lots of mistakes last week but the freedom here should suit him. It\u2019s lyrical and contempo-waft in style with plenty of Jowita Przysta\u0142\u2019s trademark spectacular lifts. A little heavy and static at times but nice lifts and scarf section. Long shoulder lift to finish. Full of feeling, from the heart, showing the healing power of dance. A fitting tribute. </p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>The Best by Nicotine Dolls. Originally by Bonnie Tyler, it was made famous by fellow diva Tina Turner in 1989 It\u2019s used as entrance music by both boxer Chris Eubank and Glasgow Rangers FC.

Here it is. After scoring nines and 10s in recent weeks, she\u2019s become a strong glitterball contender. In fact, last week\u2019s Madonna cha cha notched the highest score of the series for a dance which wasn\u2019t a Couple\u2019s Choice. Wind machine side-by-side section, then into a long lift. Foxtrot steps and soft knees for that smooth and airy feel, floating around floor. A colourful, upbeat, celebratory number with superbly executed lifts and tricks. She needs to dance flat, so is having to rein in her normal non-stop bouncy energy. Slightly hurried footwork at times but bags of style. Shame she can\u2019t sing it too. Possibly while holding a cardboard cutout of Heather Small on a wooden stick. Such fun.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>Proud by Heather Small.

He remains bookie\u2019s favourite for the exit, though, and the technically tough rumba is notoriously exposing for celebrity males. Wynne Evans ended his rumba with a burst of song last week but we can probably assume Shayne won\u2019t. They\u2019ve gone mad with the augmented reality this week. Forest projections this time. Slightly static to start, then passionate, rhythmic and flowing. Nice long lines and finger extensions but lacking a little sizzle and sensuality in the storytelling. Continuous hip action is present and correct but a little polite for me. Rose petals fall for a romantic finish.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>Time After Time by Cyndi Lauper.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for watching along with me, glittery gang. Our excellent eight pairings now progress to the week nine, live from the fabled Tower Ballroom with its Victorian splendour and sprung floor. The seaside special airs next Saturday at 6.45pm on BBC1. Meet you back here to sort the bright ballroom lights from the dim dance bulbs. In the meantime, it barely needs repeating: keeeeep dancing! Have a lovely week and see you in Blackpool. Goodnight everyone. Finally, MarkRoche says: \u201cAnton choosing partly to save a couple for a more joyous performance is a bit iffy. The rumba doesn\u2019t signify sunshine, puppies and lollipops. However, I think the right decision was made overall.\u201d TPTony adds: \u201cFeel sorry for Shayne. Definitely nowhere near the weakest dancer left.\u201d MikeMoonlight says: \u201cOuch! That\u2019s got to be the ultimate humiliation for Shayne \u2013 finding out that Shirley Ballas, the eternal saviour of hot young male dancers in the dance-off, actually preferred the slightly chunky middle-aged bald guy over him.\u201d EmmyHarb says: \u201cI think this must be the hardest week to leave the competition and to leave on a split judging panel too must surely make it worse.\u201d Swalk77 says: \u201cMy elderly mother is really offended by Pete, it\u2019s hilarious!\u201d kalioon adds: \u201cShirley better avoid Nancy for a while. The look in her eyes. Ooft.\u201d jm1476 says: \u201cWynne made more mistakes. Joyful not a criteria for voting someone off.\u201d Poppieshen adds: \u201cWell, that\u2019s Shayne gone. Oddly I almost warmed to him while he was on screen, while simultaneously forgetting about him when he wasn\u2019t. Maybe that was his problem. Once again thank you Michael for keeping this rickety charabanc on the road to Blackpool and making us laugh.\u201d Totally my pleasure, Poppie! A rapidfire vox pop of your comments. Sueserafina says: \u201cFact is, I\u2019d rather see a Katya routine in Blackpool..\u201d joe_tambien says: \u201cThere\u2019s just no forgiving Shayne for Good Ship Murder, is there?\u201d 1991fab adds: \u201cWrong decision imo for dance-off,. Viewers were so harsh on Shayne. He shouldn\u2019t have been in the dance off so many times and was one of the strongest male contestants. I don\u2019t understand Shirley\u2019s criticism of most \u2018joyful routine\u2019. What has that got to do with the technique and the errors each person made?\u201d TV viewers can now flip to ITV1 for the return of Midsomer Murders or Channel 4 for Alan Cumming travelogue, All Aboard! Scotland\u2019s Poshest Train. The night\u2019s big TV event, though, is period masterpiece Wolf Hall: The Mirror &amp; The Light at 9pm on BBC1. If you\u2019re in the market for a movie, tonight\u2019s picks are Emma (8pm on BBC3), The Revenant (9pm on Film4) and Deliverance (10pm on BBC2). Cue twanging banjos. What was going on with the scoring on Saturday? The judges often clamp down immediately before Blackpool, enabling them to get carried away in the Tower Ballroom the following weekend, but last night\u2019s marking was particularly erratic. Shirley\u2019s perfect 10 for Pete was especially eyebrow-raising, not least because she only deemed JB Gill\u2019s far superior samba worthy of a nine. However, La Ballas wasn\u2019t the only culprit. Anton du Beke\u2019s nine for Wynne was almost as daft. Indeed, half the couples got a two-point spread of scores. Craig Revel Horwood gave out several sevens, while his colleagues kept reaching for their nine and 10 paddles. Sanity needs to be restored as we enter the business end of the contest. Shayne\u2019s elimination also means the exit of his pro partner. Chinese-born Latin champion and all-round firecracker Nancy Xu has enjoyed another strong series. She\u2019s had a celebrity partner for four series, reaching the semi-final twice - with Rhys Stephenson and Will Mellor. Being first out with Les Dennis last year was her only flop. Nancy did well to steer Shayne this far, especially considering those three dance-offs. She clearly supported him well during his struggles with trolls and unpopularity. Nancy deserves a strong partner and a good run next year. He\u2019s the lowest-scoring celebrity left in the contest by far, averaging 25.6 points - nearly five points per dance fewer than the eliminated Shayne Ward. TOWIE alumnus Pete Wicks can therefore thank public support for making it past the contest\u2019s midway mark, let alone all the way to Blackpool. Dancing a Couple\u2019s Choice came at the right time for Pete. His contemporary routine, dedicated to his late nanna Doreen, was a heartstring-tugger. It didn\u2019t deserve a vastly inflated perfect 10 from Shirley Ballas, who as head judge should have known better, but a score of 36 took Pete to the dizzy heights of joint third on the scoreboard and helped ensure his safety. As a performance novice who has embraced playing characters, steadily improved and fallen in love with dance, Pete has been on the trademarked Strictly \u201cjourney\u201d. He\u2019s committed, trains hard and is smartly drilled by his partner, Polish pro Jowita Przystal, with whom he\u2019s formed the tight \u201cTeam Petita\u201d. His dry sense of humour has endeared him to viewers. Barring a miraculous leap in quality, however, he deserves to bow out before the end of November. The other big sigh of relief should come from Jamie Borthwick. He\u2019s suffered a slump in form over the past two weeks and was joint bottom of last night\u2019s scoreboard alongside Shayne. EastEnders fans must have hit the voting lines but Jamie needs to arrest the decline fast. The field was beginning to get uncomfortably male-heavy, with six celebrity men outnumbering the three remaining women by two to one. Awkward. An all-male dance-off at least means that it\u2019s now 5 to 3. Perhaps we\u2019ll have parity after the next two eliminations \u2013 just in time for the quarter-final. Opera singer Wynne Evans can count himself very lucky indeed to be making the tip to Blackpool. He was bookies\u2019 second favourite for elimination this week behind Shayne Ward, scored a mere two points more on Saturday night and squeaked past him in only the second split dance-off decision of the series. Sure, he has great musicality and nimble feet for a big fella but Wynne\u2019s continuing run in the series is largely down to his dance partner Katya Jones. As arguably the most creative choreographer among the pros, Katya puts together clever routines, works around his abilities and body type, and consistently delivers routines with wow factor. Wynne once looked an outside bet for the final but the \u201chandgate\u201d controversy has dented his popularity, while his scores have hit a plateau in the early 30s. Katya will need all her tricks to keep him in the contest for more than a couple of weeks. Very few Strictly celebrities survive a third dance-off. So it proved for Shayne Ward. He\u2019d comfortably seen off Nick Knowles and Dr Punam Krishan over the past month but Wynne Evans provided sterner opposition. Even then, Shayne came within a within a whisker of edging him out in the eliminator. It\u2019s been a strange contest for the pop star-turned-actor. He looked like a dancer packed with potential and had charisma on the floor yet never quite convinced. His highlights came when playing his music heroes. His Elvis waltz and Beatles quickstep notched his highest scores. Otherwise, he seemed to overthink, tighten up and become hesitant. Having been trolled for perceived cockiness early in the series, he often came across as needy for approval \u2013 although he\u2019s clearly a decent chap, as those gracious closing comments demonstrated. He didn\u2019t connect with voting viewers, hence those three dance-offs. The slow rumba, always technically tricky and exposing for celebrity males, came along at the wrong time. Manchester-born Shayne would have been desperate to reach Blackpool but it wasn\u2019t to be. A case of what might have been. As the eliminated couple take a final twirl around the dancefloor to the strains of Don\u2019t Dream It\u2019s Over by Crowded House (tune!), the credits roll and their castmates crowd in for cuddles. Please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. His pro partner Nancy Xu says: \u201cI\u2019m beyond proud of this partnership. From week one, every second you put your feet on the dancefloor you improved yourself. You\u2019re a deep thinker, you always doubt yourself but I never ever questioned you. When I watch you, I feel proud because I\u2019ve turned someone who has never danced in their life into an amazing dancer. You should believe in yourself. I adored this partnership.\u201d Sweetly said, Nance. In his exit speech, Shayne Ward tells Tess: \u201cYou guys up there [meaning his fellow contestants in the Clauditorium] are a dream. Every single day, you helped me so much. I want to say thank you to the audience as well, for always being amazing for us all. This has been, honestly, one of the best things I\u2019ve ever done. I\u2019m proud that I made it to eight weeks as a novice dancer. \u201cA massive thank you also goes to this incredible human right next to me [meaning Nancy], who has put so much fire in me and made me believe that I can achieve more if I let myself go. I\u2019m sorry it didn\u2019t work out to the end but I\u2019m super proud that I got to dance with you.\u201d Shirley\u2019s decisive vote means that Shayne Ward and Nancy Xu become the unlucky seventh couple to depart the Strictly 2024 dancefloor. Wynne and Katya, saying \u201cboth had hiccups but they were more powerful and joyous\u201d. In the event of a draw, of course, the head judge gets the casting vote. Which means\u2026 Wynne and Katya, saying \u201cit\u2019s tight, both made early mistakes but it threw Shayne more and made him hesitant, while Wynne cut loose\u201d. Drama! The panel is split for only the second time this series. Shayne and Nancy, saying \u201cthey were more advanced technically\u201d. So if Shayne gets one more vote, he\u2019s ripped up the form book and secured safety. Shayne and Nancy, saying \u201ccontrasting styles but for me he\u2019s the better dancer\u201d. Let\u2019s hear from the panel whose decision counts. Craig and Motsi marked both dances the same last night but Shirley and Anton scored Wynne\u2019s one point more. Wynne Evans and his dance partner Katya Jones now reprise their American smooth to Grace Kelly by Mika. The judges said last night it was that it was an energetic performance but lacked grace and flow. It scored 32 points, two more than Shayne\u2019s rumba, so Wynne needs to avoid mistakes to maintain that margin. Are we spotting slight improvement here? I think so. Shayne Ward and Nancy Xu have another go at their rumba to Time After Time by Cyndi Lauper. The judges said last night that the rumba walks were on-point but he lost timing, lacking connection and rotation. It scored 30 points, just two fewer than Wynne, so Shayne needs to show improvement to close that gap. ReclinedPotato points out: \u201cJust in case Michael doesn\u2019t mention it, the piano on The Hollies version of this song was played by a certain Reg Dwight.\u201d That\u2019s a fib, obviously. Hat-tip to Toast Of London. Remember that Michael Ball has twice the amount of blood as an average human, hence his ability t o hit those high notes. Musical interlude now from big-lunged, black-tied duo Michael Ball and Alfie Boe, crooning their version of 1969 soul ballad He Ain\u2019t Heavy, He\u2019s My Brother, made famous by The Hollies. Karen Hauer and Kai Widdrington provide high-class hoofing accompaniment. Sarah Hadland is squeakily excited about going to Blackpool. Vito says it\u2019s the \u201cbelly bottom of the world\u201d. Translation: belly button. Has the nation just been Rickrolled? More balcony chit-chat with the Blackpool-bound duos. JB Gill says he channeled Vito Coppola for his samba and Vito is endearingly delighted. Shayne Ward and Nancy Xu must hoof again for survival. He was joint bottom of the scoreboard and has been in two dance-offs before, so perhaps that was to be expected. So are JB Gill and Sarah Hadland. Rightly so. The dreaded crimson spotlight is back to do its dastardly thing. Let\u2019s find out who will face Wynne in the dance-off. Motsi and Shirley explain the magical appeal of the Blackpool Tower Ballroom. Sprung floor klaxon! Drink! Craig Revel Horwood was taken by surprise by Sarah Hadland\u2019s cartwheel giing straight into a fishtail lift. Gaw-jus, dah-link. Craig Revel Horwood says \u201csolar plexus\u201d three times and Claudia suspects he\u2019s just cast a spell. Shirley Ballas justifies her 10 for Pete Wicks and his nanna. Motsi Mabuse breaks down Jamie Borthwick\u2019s balance issues during the Argentine tango. The paddle-raising panel perch on Claudia\u2019s teal banquette for a breakdown of last night\u2019s dances. Anton du Beke admires JB Gill\u2019s saaarmba. An already affecting number is made even more emotional by a Chelsea Pensioner arriving at the end, with Gorka fading into the veteran via the magic of TV. He then pins a poppy to a young girl. Just lovely. Something in my eye. Time for a Remembrance Sunday routine from the pros, paying tribute to the armed forces past and present, as well as the Royal British Legion. Choreographed by the brilliant Lizzie Gough, it follows the life of a serviceman and the story of the Remembrance poppy over the past century. Michelle Tsiakkas plays the wife of Gorka M\u00e1rquez, pinning a poppy to his chest. During the routine, Gorka ages from a young adult to an elderly man, thanks to clever camera work. A poignant tale of love, passion and pain. It\u2019s set to The Blower\u2019s Daughter by Damien Rice - the tender folky ballad which became Rice\u2019s debut hit in 2001. Jamie Borthwick\u2019s lifestyle tips, there. Claudia Winkleman admits there have been 199 mentions of the B-word already and rounds it up to a neat 200. Pete Wicks will be cha-cha-cha-ing to Right Said Fred in Blackpool. Expect pecs. In the Clauditorium with the relieved couples who are heading to Blackpool, sauce-averse, condiment-sceptic Jamie Borthwick sympathises with Wynne, with whom he\u2019s very close \u2013 and reveals that\u2019s he\u2019s a regular in Blackpool for \u201cthe darts\u201d. Good arrers. Well, that\u2019s a mild shock. Wynne Evans and his pro partner Katya Jones are consigned to the dance-off for the first time. He finished third from the foot on the leaderboard but didn\u2019t get enough viewer and fell into the bottom two. That\u2019s a most welcome result. After that incredible, inspirational Couple\u2019s Choice routine with its powerful blackout moment, Chris McCausland and Dianne Buswell will be heading up the M6 to the home of ballroom. So is Montell Douglas. He was joint bottom of the scoreboard but the EastEnders actor has been saved by the public vote. Which means we could be in for a dance-off surprise. Scarlet spotlight time. Time to find out who\u2019s booked their seat on the Megabus to Blackpool and who might be left at home. Our nervous nine couples wait to hear their fates in a feast of ruffled ra-ra skirts, matador capes and shiny separates in muted tones. The judging panel discuss the dances. They might have a tricky decision to make later. In the home stretch of the contest, it tends to be tight. A recap of Saturday night\u2019s action on-screen now. Tasha Ghouri\u2019s head-snapping quickstep beats the curse of dancing first! JB Gill\u2019s body-rolling carnival samba! A pair of contrasting Couple\u2019s Choices! Beige costumes! Man-buns! Bizarre scoring! Here\u2019s our hostly duo, so let\u2019s do a rapid gown rundown. Tess Daly is shoulderless red. Claudia Winkleman in a black cocktail classic. Tess narrowly wins, making it one-all this weekend. Cue that ba-ba-da theme tune and roll those familiar credits. Which pair won\u2019t be needing their bucket and spade? Put down your second screen, restock your snack platter and freshen up your drink. We\u2019re about to be beamed back into the Elstree Studios ballroom\u2026 The bottom three spots on last night\u2019s scoreboard were all occupied by male celebrities \u2013 namely Shayne Ward, Jamie Borthwick and Wynne Evans. Are we in for a mano-a-mano dance-off? Just five minutes to wait now\u2026 Another email just in from our Canadian correspondent, Iain Crofts in Montreal, who seems to have his eye on international editions worldwide. In last night\u2019s liveblog, you mentioned feeling Charleston-deprived in this season of Strictly. If you haven\u2019t seen it, you might enjoy the Charleston that Bianca Guaccero and Giovanni Pernice performed on Ballando con le Stelle for a perfect score of 50 last week, available on YouTube. They danced to Mein Herr from Cabaret. Some of the moves reminded me of Helen Skelton and Gorka M\u00e1rquez\u2019s Couple\u2019s Choice to the same song last year. See what you make of it \u2013 and keeeep blogging! Mountain elephants, snow leopards and red pandas currently stealing the show on our wildlife warm-up, David Attenborough-narrated BBC1 epic Asia. Majestic Sunday night viewing. Any last dance-off predictions? A mere 10 minutes until choreographic kick-off\u2026 Tonight\u2019s musical guests are Ball &amp; Boe, aka poperatic duo Michel Ball and Alfie Boe. Wonder if either of them will ever sign up for Strictly? It worked for Wynne \u201cGio Compario\u201d Evans. Fifteen minutes until the clock strikes sequins\u2026 The couples\u2019 total scores might have all been in the 30s last night but there weren\u2019t as many perfect 10s as we\u2019ve seen in recent weeks. Just four maximums were awarded \u2013 two for Tasha Ghouri, one for JB Gill and, bafflingly, another for Pete Wicks. That\u2019s the lowest number of 10s since week four. The traditional pre-Blackpool dip? Hold tight, it\u2019s 20 minutes until we\u2019re back in the ballroom\u2026 As is Strictly tradition at this time of year, tonight\u2019s results show features a Remembrance-themed number from the professional dancers. It should be a tear-jerker and (no spoilers) features a poignant surprise a the end. It\u2019s 25 minutes until the mirrorball starts spinning again\u2026 Shayne Ward came into this weekend as bookies\u2019 favourite for elimination and duly finished joint bottom of the judgely scoreboard. Will viewer votes rescue him from a hat-trick of dance-off appearances? If so, are we about to see a shock pre-Blackpool result? Half an hour until we get our first clues\u2026 The big glittery bus to the pleasure beach is about to depart - but one couple will be denied a seat. Good evening and welcome to the latest elimination of Strictly Come Dancing 2024. I\u2019m Michael, your cyber-seasider for tonight\u2019s results show. Please watch along with me as the seventh celebrity is sent home and their Blackpool hopes are dashed. Following last night\u2019s live show, our nifty nine remaining pro-celebrity pairings will be narrowed down to eight. The judges\u2019 scores have been combined with the public vote and tonight the bottom two will do battle in the dreaded dance-off. So whose Tower Ballroom plans might be cruelly cancelled? Well, Saturday night saw samba king JB Gill and quickstep queen Tasha Ghouri tied at the top of the standings. Way down the bottom were Shayne Ward and Jamie Borthwick. Will voting viewers agree? If not, the likes of Wynne Evans, Pete Wicks and even Sarah Hadland could be at risk. It\u2019s showtime at 7.20pm on BBC One. I\u2019ll be liveblogging from 6.50pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and single servings of mild snark. So throw an extra log on the Sunday night fire and see you on the sofa. As always, I\u2019d love to hear from you too. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me at michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for pre-Blackpool bantz. I\u2019ll rumba-walk down there intermittently to see what you\u2019re saying and report your comments up top. You can almost taste the fish, chips, candy floss and deep-fried donuts. Nearly time to staaaaaart seaside eliminating! Well, who\u2019s Blackpool-bound and who\u2019s doomed for minibreak heartbreak? That concludes tonight\u2019s liveblog action but meet you back here for the Remembrance Sunday results show, which airs at 7.20pm Sunday on BBC1. I\u2019ll kickstart the blog at 6.50pm for build-up, so please rejoin me then. In the meantime, I\u2019m @michaelhogan on Twitter, so please feel free to give me a follow or say hi. As always, thanks for watching along with me, glitterball gang. Hope to see you at the same time, same place tomorrow. Until then, it\u2019s the fab-ew-lous family motto: keeeeeep dancing! Goodnight. Finally, MJfromStaunton says: \u201cCan\u2019t listen to Shirley being critical to the likes of Sarah, Jamie etc and then scoring JB a 9 against Pete Wicks 10. She is ridiculous.\u201d MikeMoonlight adds: \u201cEvening all. Sorry I\u2019m late but I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t post a comment tonight until the Deliveroo guy had dropped off my Indian flatbread. So yes, this one\u2019s for me Naan.\u201d On Chris McCausland\u2019s Couple\u2019s Choice, neverhopeful says: \u201cBrilliant comments from Chris. It\u2019s not blind or disabled people that need to be inspired, it\u2019s the rest of us that need to change our thinking and our expectations of disabled people.\u201d whistledownthewind says: \u201cIn a week that\u2019s felt pretty dark for many of us, it\u2019s wonderful that Chris has brought us a little bit of joy and sunshine. How he dances so well is a wonder. I truly believe that Strictly doesn\u2019t get any better than this.\u201d MarkRoche adds: \u201cChris is a better dancer than I ever will be and Dianne\u2019s teaching is phenomenal but I feel he\u2019s on a downward trajectory these last couple of weeks.\u201d On Montell Douglas\u2019 paso doble, TheMathDiva says: \u201cI don\u2019t like this modern twist on the paso. I\u2019m too much of a traditionalist. Sorry, Mojo.\u201d GorillaChops says: \u201cGreat dancing from Montell but that song was a dismal choice. Plus all those effects on the floor and the purple outfits made it feel like I was looking into a box of Quality Street.\u201d yorkshirecoast adds: \u201cI do love a paso. Might watch that again with the sound down and some different music, though. I think they were dancing to a different song but I\u2019d still give it a 10!\u201d On Jamie Borthwick\u2019s Argentine tango, ReclinedPotato says: \u201cRemarkable dancing by Michelle. Pity she didn\u2019t give her partner something else to do apart from showcasing her.\u201d NonIronLady adds: \u201cThat tango gave me the impression it was Jamie\u2019s first behind-the-bike-shed fumble with a girl in the year above.\u201d On Wynne Evans, diamondcat says: \u201cPoor Wynne always looks so anxious when he faces the judges. I wish he wouldn\u2019t, he\u2019s so watchable.\u201d On JB Gill\u2019s samba, acanthe says: \u201cNow that was a samba! I am gutted we\u2019ve lost Amy but it\u2019s so good to see Lauren with a partner.\u201d Heartticker says: \u201cWell, well, well. JB has found his groove with Lauren and is peaking at the right time. Good job.\u201d Phoebe adds: \u201cA great samba from JB. A welcome cheerful burst of fun and colour after the melodrama from Pete.\u201d On Pete Wicks, tomatopincushion say: \u201cThe most \u2018couple\u2019s choice\u2019 couple\u2019s choice of the series so far. Didn\u2019t do it for me. I did miss all the story leading up to it, though.\u201d YodaknowsAll adds: \u201cI feel that\u2019s the first time Pete has truly danced, as opposed to just following the steps. Really good.\u201d On Sarah Hadland\u2019s American smooth, jagadox says: \u201cWow! Those lifts. Outstanding. Yet the judges always seem to carp at her.\u201d LilywhiteDub says: \u201cSeeing as tens are being flung about this series like confetti, I give a ten for Sarah\u2019s smile during that dance. She is everything that this programme should be about. Loved it.\u201d AndyPandy21 says: \u201cSarah and Vito are just such a great pairing. Wonderful match in physicality, phrasing and musicality.\u201d MsChuffy adds: \u201cSarah and Vito. UNDERMARKED. That\u2019s all I got to say.\u201d When it comes to Shayne Ward, whistledownthewind says: \u201cIf the 10-paddle crazy Motsi and Shirley are critical of your rumba, I suspect the dance-off may beckon for Shayne.\u201d MartGray adds: \u201cHoly smoulder, Batman, I know nowt but I\u2019d give that Shayne and Nancy-dancy a ten. Extra points for Shayne\u2019s much-improved hair.\u201d A swift straw poll of readers\u2019 comments. On Tasha Ghouri, MarkRoche says: \u201cSmashing quickstep (appalling music choice notwithstanding).\u201d Pancake01 says: \u201cFrock too long, couldn\u2019t see her feet for a lot of it. Felt a bit skippy?\u201d Tomatopincushion says: \u201cYears of watching Strictly and I have finally learnt I love a quickstep. Gorgeous, Tasha!\u201d SnailyWhaley adds: \u201cThis old fuddy duddy thinks quickstep should not be a midriff-baring dance.\u201d After two themed live shows in a row - the traditional Halloween Spooktacular, followed by the fun but slightly gratuitous Icons Week - it was something of a relief to cast off the fancy dress and concentrate on dancing, don\u2019t you think? That scoring was a lot, though. Shirley\u2019s 10 for Pete seemed a particular case of heart over head. From the head judge, it felt particularly inconsistent. TV viewers can now flip to Ultimate Covers Versions on BBC2 or choose from a pair of quizzes: Michael McIntyre\u2019s The Wheel on BBC1 or The Chase: Celebrity Special on ITV1. At 9pm, it\u2019s the Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance 2024 on BBC1. At 10pm, David Baddiel: The Not the Trilogy arrives on Sky Arts. At 10.05pm, The Pixies, Max Richter and Neneh Cherry are on the bill of BBC2\u2019s Later. It\u2019s you fancy a film, at 9pm, there\u2019s Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby on 5Star. At 10.05, The Man With The Golden Arm is on Rewind. I can also heartily recommend gorgeous French love story Paris, 13th District at 10.30pm on BBC4. Ooh and, if you will, la la. They\u2019re golden, glittery, spherical and totally imaginary. Here are this week\u2019s gong-getters\u2026 Best dance: JB Gill\u2019s firecracker samba. Never easy for celebrity males but he made it look like a body-rippling riot. Worst dance: Shayne Ward\u2019s rumba. It scored the same as Jamie Borthwick\u2019s Argentine tango but wasn\u2019t as watchable. Best music choice: Arctic Monkeys and Cyndi Lauper were both belters. Worst music choice: Mika and Tina Turner rather creaked at the seams vocally. Best outfit: Loved Motsi\u2019s dress and Michelle\u2019s eye make-up but the prize goes to Sarah Hadland\u2019s green frock, despite gusset-ography worries during the lifts. Worst outfit: Tasha Ghouri\u2019s skirt was too long to see her footwork properly but poor JB\u2019s brown pleather slacks were worse. Best judges\u2019 comment: Anton admonishing Vito for not pointing his toes during a cartwheel: \u201cI told you this last series and it\u2019s getting on my nerves.\u201d \u201cSorry, Anton,\u201d said an endearingly sheepish Vito like a schoolboy who\u2019d let his teacher down. Worst VT: Shayne\u2019s beanie hat of sincerity in the park. Best Claudia quip: A dead heat between her mouthing \u201cHelp me\u201d during the pros\u2019 balcony antics and \u201cgoing a bit Yoda\u201d when she got a link in a tangle. The luxuriantly bearded judge remains the only member of the panel not to raise his maximum paddle. Saving it up for Blackpool, do we predict? If so, who will be the recipient? On a night of erratic scoring, only seven points separate top from bottom. JB Gill and Tasha Ghouri jointly top the standings. Shayne Ward and Jamie Borthwick are joint bottom. As always, though the viewer vote helps decide who\u2019ll be illuminated by the scarlet spotlight of dance-off doom. Wynne Evans might also be in for an anxious wait. Tess and Claud tell us to \u201cKeeeeeep dancing!\u201d as is traditional. Except with Claud in novelty sea-front shades. As everyone starts optimistically packing their wheely suitcases for Blackpool, please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. Tonight\u2019s routines get recapped on-screen. Which twinkle-toed pair get your vote? Which clod-hopping couple definitely don\u2019t? Prop-heavy Clauditorium mayhem ensues. Tried to go too early again. Remember to vote for your favourites if you don\u2019t want any nasty surprises tomorrow. We\u2019ve had enough grim results for one week, right? Judges\u2019 scores for Chris and Dianne: 7 (oof), 8, 9, 9 for a total of 33 points. Mid-table. Judges\u2019 comments for Chris and Dianne: Craig says \u201cthat routine belongs in a musical, brilliantly put together, flow was missing but the lift coming out of that poignant blackout moment was spectacular, I really don\u2019t know how you\u2019re doing this\u201d. Motsi says \u201ctiming on-point, a message that\u2019s bigger than the show, I felt that in my heart, inspiring, loved it\u201d. Shirley says \u201cthe most unique partnership I\u2019ve ever seen on any dance show around the world, Dianne teaches you so well and Chris, you don\u2019t miss a bit, you\u2019re a winner in my book\u201d. Anton concludes \u201cthe most extraordinary thing I\u2019ve ever seen, remarkable, inspirational and Dianne deserves a trophy for the professional who\u2019s done the most incredible job, a partnership built on trust and togetherness\u201d. Nines all round? Comedian Chris McCausland\u2019s scores have dipped in the past fortnight and he\u2019s been in the bottom two but this should arrest that trend. Emotive VT about his disability and desire to represent the blind community. A song by a fellow Liverpudlian and a routine full of personal connection and meaning. All-white outfits. Starts off standing on a table and chair, then hops down onto the floor with lots of smiling and showmanship. It\u2019s a mix of jazz and musical theatre, showcasing his innate musicality. The odd footwork whoopsie and wobbly lift but euphoric and full of positivity. An impactful black screen moment to represent his blindness, then a spinning lift and a walloping finish. As the song says, \u201dYou\u2019re a superstar, that\u2019s what you are.\u201d A dose of pure dance joy. Song: Instant Karma! (We All Shine On) by John Lennon. Songs by The Beatles have appeared 10 times on Strictly but this is a first for Lennon solo. In 1970, the Phil Spector-produced track became the first solo single by a Beatle to sell a million copies in the US. Its chorus inspired the title to Stephen King\u2019s The Shining. It\u2019s one of the fastest-released songs in pop history, arriving in record stores just 10 days after it was written. As Lennon said: \u201cI wrote it for breakfast, recorded it for lunch and we\u2019re putting it out for dinner.\u201d Judges\u2019 scores for Montell and Jojo: 9, 9, 9, 9 for a total of 36 points. Joint third as it stands. Judges\u2019 comments for Montell and Jojo: Motsi says \u201cloved it, I got lost in the dance, clear message, there was spice, attack and fire in every moment\u201d. Shirley says \u201cwarrior of the evening, beautiful footwork and twist-turns, I loved it too\u201d. Anton says \u201cwhoosh, acceleration, so engrossing\u201d. Craig concludes \u201cyour foot was sickled, a terrible shame because it was almost perfect, that\u2026 was\u2026 something else\u201d. Nines. Maybe a 10? Last week\u2019s dance-off survivors bid to bounce back and they\u2019ve got a good dance to do so. Montell Douglas averages two points more for Latin than she scores for ballroom. The Noughties floor-filler isn\u2019t a traditional paso song by any means but they\u2019re still tapping into the classic paso elements. Fire from Gladiators is relishing the attitude and characterisation. Footwork, facial expressions and body movements coming together in one fierce package. Team Mojo are mirroring each other in the routine and with their purple costumes too. Cape-work and matching skirt-ography. Lots of leg. Sharp, dramatic and power-packed, just lacking a little curve for me. Contemporary and cool. Ol\u00e9! Song: Lola\u2019s Theme by The Shapeshifters. That was originaly just the working title of this chart-topping 2004 house banger - named after producer Simon Marlin\u2019s wife because it was her record collection that inspired the song. However, the title stuck and Lola herself appeared in the video, handing out candy floss at a funfair. Judges\u2019 scores for Wynne and Katya: 7, 8, 8, 9 for a total of 32 points. Third from bottom so far. Enough to be safe? Judges\u2019 comments for Wynne and Katya: Shirley says \u201cpivots and footwork coming on nicely, wonderful performance\u201d. Anton says \u201ctechnically great, joie de vivre and energy, powerful lifts, smooth like it says on the tin\u201d. Craig says \u201clacked style and grace but I love watching you\u201d. Motsi concludes \u201cyou left your heart on the dancefloor but the transitions need to flow\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019re an absolute legend,\u201d Katya tells Wynne as they trot upstairs. After last week\u2019s moody rumba, Wynne Evans picks up the pace for an American smooth. He\u2019s yet to perform a foxtrot this series, so these steps are new to him. At least the footwork, drive and frame are familiar from his previous ballroom numbers. Clever, creative choreography as always from pro partner Katya Jones. Both mouthing the words, which is a tad distracting but it takes off when the music picks up. Changes of pace and great musicality. Leaps and lifts, razzle-dazzle entertainment and wow factor. Song: Grace Kelly by Mika. The debut hit by the British-Lebanese singer was the third biggest-selling UK single of 2007. He wrote it as a satire on musicians who reinvent themselves to become popular after a record company exec told him to be \u201cmore like Craig David\u201d. Mika performed it during the interval when he co-hosted Eurovision 2022 in Turin. Ginger Neil gets his moment, doing the social media spiel. Claudia loving it. Genu-lols. Judges\u2019 scores for Jamie and Michelle: 7, 8, 7, 8 for a total of 30 points. Joint bottom as it stands. Dance-off danger? Surely not. Judges\u2019 comments for Jamie and Michelle: Motsi says \u201creally hot connection and story, clear accents but got a little tight and static, good try\u201d. Shirley says \u201cdidn\u2019t quite work for me, your balance was off, tried too hard and too much tension in your body, stiff and lumpy\u201d. Anton says \u201cagree, wonderful line and quality but relax, you\u2019re such a talent\u201d. Craig concludes \u201cbalance issues throughout and your foot got stuck, a bit over-placed but it had control and gaw-jus musicality\u201d. Eights? The Argentine tango is always thrilling and Jamie Borthwick, the first celebrity male to tackle it this series, say it\u2019s his dream dance. Ideal to bounce back from last week\u2019s disappointing George Michael samba. It\u2019s Michelle Tsiakkas\u2019 first Argentine tango on Strictly too, so she\u2019s equally excited. Bit of undressing to start. The EastEnders actor is enjoying the chance to get serious and sensual. Strong connection, slinky moves and a goosebump-inducing song. Sharp, passionate and technically precise, packed with details. Constantly transferring weight between them. Masterful leading but his posture wobbles in places. Intense and hawt with a strong line to finish. Song: Do I Wanna Know? by Arctic Monkeys. The 2003 indie-rock banger is suitably dramatic and moody, built around a stomping guitar riff. It\u2019s often used by the band to open their shows. You might recognise it from a Bacardi ad or the second season finale of Peaky Blinders. This isn\u2019t the Arctic Monkeys\u2019 Strictly debut. Joe Sugg and Dianne Buswell performed their showdance to I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor in the 2018 final. Judges\u2019 scores for JB and Lauren: 9, 9, 9, 10 for a total of 37 points. Joint top with Tasha. Judges\u2019 comments for JB and Lauren: Anton says \u201cI\u2019m stunned, man alive, you brung it, wriggly and full of snake oil, I came over a bit peculiar\u201d. Craig says \u201cdon\u2019t embarrass yourself, Anton darling, JB means jolly brilliant\u201d. Motsi says \u201cup there with Kelvin Fletcher and Danny Mac as Strictly\u2019s king of samba\u201d. Shirley concludes \u201cin it to win it, congratulations to Amy for putting the fundamentals in place\u201d. A 39-pointer, perchance? JB Gill has a permanent new partner now in the form of home-grown pro Lauren Oakley, who\u2019s always a joy to watch. JB needs to keep the confidence and freedom from last week\u2019s Couple\u2019s Choice and bring it to the Latin party dance. Classic rhythmical music and he\u2019s got natural groove. Great opening, all legs and limber hips. Expressive shimmies and shakes. Lock steps, plenty of ripples and body rolls. Fluidity, suppleness and bounce. This is seriously good, especially for a male celeb\u2019s samba. On-point. Song: Mas Que Nada by S\u00e9rgio Mendes. The Brazilian musician died just two months ago, aged 83. This 1966 hit became one of his signature songs. He rerecorded it in 2006 with the Black Eyed Peas. Judges\u2019 scores for Pete and Jowita: 8, 9, 10 (wow), 9 for a total of 36 points. His best. Proud mum in the audience. Pete affectingly choked-up on the balcony. Judges\u2019 comments for Pete and Jowita: Rousing reception in the studio. An emotional Shirley says \u201cbeautiful, your heart and soul shone, immersed in music and dancing, what it\u2019s all about\u201d. Anton says \u201cthe best bits of you were all on the floor, a slightly gammy arm but so natural, told the story with feeling\u201d. Craig says \u201cmoving, loved the sentiment but wanted flow in the transitions and more polished technique\u201d. Motsi concludes \u201cloved the way you opened your heart, made magic happen, you did your job and made Jowita look a million dollars, your best dance\u201d. Hard to score. An eights and three nines? This should be an emotional one. The song means a lot to Pete Wicks, since it was the favourite song of his beloved nanna, Doreen, and was played at her funeral in 2022. He said this week: \u201cShe was my best mate and I wish she was here to watch me on Strictly,. This is my way of having her with me. I\u2019ve spent more time crying than dancing this week.\u201d Aww. For the first time, he\u2019s not playing a character, just being himself. \u201cIt\u2019s the most vulnerable I\u2019ve ever been in 11 years on TV,\u201d he says. He\u2019s the lowest scoring celebrity left in the competition and made lots of mistakes last week but the freedom here should suit him. It\u2019s lyrical and contempo-waft in style with plenty of Jowita Przysta\u0142\u2019s trademark spectacular lifts. A little heavy and static at times but nice lifts and scarf section. Long shoulder lift to finish. Full of feeling, from the heart, showing the healing power of dance. A fitting tribute. Song: The Best by Nicotine Dolls. Originally by Bonnie Tyler, it was made famous by fellow diva Tina Turner in 1989 It\u2019s used as entrance music by both boxer Chris Eubank and Glasgow Rangers FC. Antiques expert Tim Wonnacott\u2019s ill-fated paso to this song with Natalie \u201cLegs\u201d Lowe, way back in series 12, saw him eliminated. Let\u2019s hope they fare better. Judges\u2019 scores for Sarah and Vito: 8, 8, 8, 9 for a total of 33 points. It\u2019s 15 years today since Miranda debuted. Makes you feel Proud. Judges\u2019 comments for Sarah and Vito: Craig says \u201cyour blocky hands bothered me but you\u2019re extremely talented, clean, cartwheel into lift was spectacular\u201d. Motsi says \u201ctook lifts to a whole new level, consistently high standard but got a little tight and lost softness\u201d. Shirley says \u201ctiming and execution very good but issues with gapping and closing of feet, on the right track but needs neater details\u201d. Anton concludes \u201cnitty picky, love your legs and base, just free up your upper body\u201d. Nines ahoy? Well, Sarah Hadland surely had to dance to the in-joke song from sitcom Miranda at some point. Here it is. After scoring nines and 10s in recent weeks, she\u2019s become a strong glitterball contender. In fact, last week\u2019s Madonna cha cha notched the highest score of the series for a dance which wasn\u2019t a Couple\u2019s Choice. Wind machine side-by-side section, then into a long lift. Foxtrot steps and soft knees for that smooth and airy feel, floating around floor. A colourful, upbeat, celebratory number with superbly executed lifts and tricks. She needs to dance flat, so is having to rein in her normal non-stop bouncy energy. Slightly hurried footwork at times but bags of style. Shame she can\u2019t sing it too. Possibly while holding a cardboard cutout of Heather Small on a wooden stick. Such fun. Song: Proud by Heather Small. Since its 2000 release, the M People diva\u2019s debut solo single has become a rousing motivational anthem, often used at the Olympics and London Marathon. Judges\u2019 scores for Shayne and Nancy: 7, 8, 7, 8 for a total of 30 points. Dance-off danger? Judges\u2019 comments for Shayne and Nancy: Motsi says \u201clight and shade, loved the rumba walks but timing was off, so weight transference looked slow and heavy\u201d. Shirley says \u201csensitive details and chemistry but I was conflicted, some outstanding bits but lost timing\u201d. Anton says \u201cyou\u2019re invested in Nancy, nice musicality but I wanted better foot speed\u201d. Craig concludes \u201cdead space in your chest, lacked connection and stretch but hip action good and masculine\u201d. Sevens and eights, do we say? Shayne Ward has survived two dance-offs but showed some fight last week, closing the show with his Beatles quickstep. He remains bookie\u2019s favourite for the exit, though, and the technically tough rumba is notoriously exposing for celebrity males. Wynne Evans ended his rumba with a burst of song last week but we can probably assume Shayne won\u2019t. They\u2019ve gone mad with the augmented reality this week. Forest projections this time. Slightly static to start, then passionate, rhythmic and flowing. Nice long lines and finger extensions but lacking a little sizzle and sensuality in the storytelling. Continuous hip action is present and correct but a little polite for me. Rose petals fall for a romantic finish. Song: Time After Time by Cyndi Lauper. Awarded Song Of Year at the 1985 Grammys, the pop ballad was used in cathartic prom scenes from both Napoleon Dynamite and Romy &amp; Michele\u2019s High School Reunion. The Drag Race judge and Strictly alumna is this week\u2019s Clauditorium guest to recite the voting smallprint. She even wore sparkles for the occasion Judges\u2019 scores for Tasha and Alja\u017e: 8, 10, 10, 9 for a total of 37 points. That\u2019ll take some beating. Judges\u2019 comments for Tasha and Alja\u017e: Anton says \u201cthe way to book a place in Blackpool, got all your steps in for the day, great frame and flow\u201d. Craig says \u201ca bit safe, push it more, I wanted Charleston breakout and pendulum steps\u201d. Motsi says \u201cit had everything, full of detail, made it look easy\u201d. Shirley concludes \u201cfull-on dancing, difficult steps done well\u201d. Blackpool mentioned copiously already. Nines, do we reckon? Last week\u2019s Couple\u2019s Choice meant that Tasha Ghouri has topped the scoreboard four times in seven weeks. Opening the show, can she maintain that form? Alja\u017e \u0160korjanec has increased the difficulty of the footwork for this quickstep, confident that Tasha can handle it. Crazy escalator projections making me feel a bit dizzy, frankly, then into a fast, full-on routine, with changes of rhythm and timing. Running and leaping around the floor. Slightly out of sync in the side-by-side sections? Showcasing great stamina to keep it smooth. Lots of spins with impressive head whips. Wow. A jazzy showstopper. Or rather showstarter. Song: Fantasy by Mariah Carey. The 1999 dance-pop hit became Mariah\u2019s ninth number one and helped popularise guest rappers on pop singles with its verses from Wu-Tang Clan\u2019s Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard. Who has a lot in common with Dave Arch, I imagine. Kindred spirits. Our nine couples emerge on the staircase of dreams to wave hi. A merciful lack of fancy dress this week but Pete Wicks is a symphony in mushroom. Wynne Evans in a sparkly rainbow tailcoat. Chris McCausland in all-white with matching top hat. The paddle-raising panel make their grand entrance. Thank goodness Anton Du Beke has lost that dinnerlady-with-a-mullet wig. Motsi Mabuse looks fab-ew-lous. Here\u2019s our two-headed hosting hydra, so time for the traditional sartorial size-up. Tess Daly is in a sequinned teal mermaid dress. Claudia Winkleman is in classic black silk. Claudia wins. Tap your feet! Hum along! Realise that you\u2019d forgotten several of these couples ever existed! Roll the industry standard tension-building VT. Blackpool is at stake, apparently. Who knew? Hitch up your Spanx and buff your dancing spats. We\u2019re about to go over live to the Elstree Studios ballroom\u2026 Alan Carr\u2019s Numberwang js our televisual amuse-bouche once again - and will be every Saturday until the semi-final. Oh goody. Let\u2019s do some light stretching. Mere minutes to wait now\u2026 Little gem of a factoid from this week\u2019s Popbitch newsletter, which I hoped might tickle you: Nominative Determinism: one of the contestants on the Czech version of Strictly this year is actress Marta Dancingerov\u00e1. Not long now until choreographic kick-off\u2026 This week it was announced that after a six-year hiatus, this series sees the return of the Strictly dance-athon. In a fortnight\u2019s time, all the remaining couples will hit the dancefloor together to showcase their Latin skills in a samba-thon, hoping to change their place on the leaderboard. Cue the traditional judgely chaos and jabbing at iPads. Ten minutes until showtime\u2026 An email from our regular correspondent across the Pond, Iain Crofts from Montreal: \u201cHi again, Michael and everyone. It\u2019s a shame that the popularity-contest element is so strong in Strictly. Having been consigned to the dance off twice already, Shayne must be wondering if he can ward off Pete\u2019s popularity this weekened. It is of some consolation that the dance-offs are nominally determined by who dances better. On the American version, Dancing with the Stars, voting opens before the dancing even starts and there is no dance-off. You can vote for your favourites before they\u2019ve even performed and the combination of judges\u2019 scores and audience votes sends one couple packing at the end of the show. No attempt to amp up the \u2018dance competition aspect on this side of the Atlantic, unfortunately.\u201d We can compare and contrast with two Couple\u2019s Choices (from Pete Wicks and Chris McCausland) and two American smooths (from Sarah Hadland and Wynne Evans). Other potential highlights include a paso doble, a rumba and an Argentine tango. Just me or are there not enough Charlestons and jives so far this series? It\u2019s 15 minutes until that ba-ba-da theme tune\u2026 Cross them off as they happen! Take a drink for each! Wake up in the wee small hours with a slice of pizza stuck to your cheek! Here\u2019s your 10-point spotter\u2019s guide for tonight: Shayne Ward bares his chest for the rumba Couple\u2019s Choice routine gets wildly over-scored because nobody knows how to judge it Pudsey Bear dances across the screen during a Children In Need trailer Someone has overdone the fake tan and bears a triggering resembles to Donald Trump Anton says of an American smooth \u201cThat\u2019s the sort of number I\u2019d like to dance\u201d Motsi and Shirley gang up on Craig when he criticises a celebrity\u2019s footwork Claudia interrupts Vito\u2019s rambling post-dance interview with \u201cGood luck, the scores are in\u201d Last week\u2019s eliminated pro Nikita Kuzmin compensates by hogging limelight on the balcony Tess fans herself with cue card after a rumba or Argentine tango \u201cPhew, that was hot!\u201d Craig Revel Horwood wears a kiss-me-quick hat or knotted hankie on his head when the voting lines are opened With six celebrity males and just three females remaining in the field, it\u2019s surely time for a man to be eliminated. The bookies agree, with Shayne Ward their odds-on prediction to leave this weekend. Wynne Evans is the second favourite to depart, with JB Gill and Pete Wicks next on the list. Can this quartet pull something special out of the sparkly bag and defy the odds? Twenty minutes until the glittery curtain comes up\u2026 Several pieces of news about the Strictly professionals broke this week. First, Amy Dowden will sadly not be returning for the rest of the series. Following a stress fracture on her foot - unrelated to her previous medical conditions, she has emphasised - Amy needs to rest for a few weeks. She\u2019s hoping to be back dancing in some capacity, perhaps in group numbers or the festive special, before the year is out. We hope so too. Amy is heartbroken to miss out and says \u201cbeing back with my Strictly family was the best rehab and helped hugely with my well-being\u201d. We wish her all the best. Like she did last week, Amy\u2019s friend and fellow pro Lauren Oakley will partner JB Gill for the rest of the series. He couldn\u2019t be in better hands. Meanwhile, tabloids reported that another much-loved pro, Johannes Radebe, will quit at the end of this series to pursue other opportunities. Jojo has called these rumours \u201clies\u201d, saying: \u201cI want to do this beautiful show for as long as they want me - and the body will allow.\u201d Phew, frankly. Now that\u2019s all cleared up, it\u2019s 25 minutes until the clock strikes Strictly\u2026 We\u2019ve passed the contest\u2019s midway mark. Now another annual milestone looms. The Strictly charabanc\u2019s annual jaunt up to Blackpool Tower Ballroom, the spiritual home of the show, is a trip that every couple wants to take. With so much at stake, could the pressure get to our pro-celebrity pairings? We\u2019ll get our first clues in half-an-hour\u2026 The Tower Ballroom beckons \u2013 but somebody will get left behind on the hard shoulder of the M6. Good evening and welcome to week eight of Strictly Come Dancing 2024. I\u2019m Michael, your donkey-riding dance partner for tonight\u2019s live show. I\u2019d love you to watch along with me as our nine remaining pro-celebrity pairings bid to make it to the bright lights of Blackpool. Last weekend\u2019s first ever Icons Week saw a huge 17-point gap open up between the top and bottom of the leaderboard, with Tasha Ghouri and JB Gill tied at the top with 39 points apiece. Pete Wicks and his Freddie Mercury moustache were way down at the bottom but it was Sam Quek who was Taylor Swift-ly sent home. Our surviving duos now hit the Elstree Studios dancefloor again with the annual trip north to the fabled home of ballroom firmly in their sights. As always, tonight\u2019s scores will be combined with the public vote and the bottom two will dance for survival on Sunday night. It looks the male celebrities who are most at risk but don\u2019t rule out a seaside surprise. In a week of dark news for many, some Strictly sparkle and joy will be more welcome than ever. It\u2019s showtime at 6.35pm on BBC One. I\u2019ll be liveblogging from 6.05pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and salty asides. So start mentally packing your wheely suitcase with sparkly disco-wear and see you on the sofa. As always, I\u2019d love to hear from you too. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for hoofing-related hilarity. I\u2019ll swing and sway down there from time to time to see what you\u2019re all saying and report on your reactions. How many times will we hear the B-word tonight? By which I mean Blackpool - oops, there\u2019s another one. Nearly time to staaaart seaside qualifying!",

      "bodyText": "Good morning. As Donald Trump secures Arizona, bringing his total of electoral college votes to 312 compared with Kamala Harris\u2019 226, attention is turning to what a Trump presidency means for the world. Australia\u2019s treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will use a speech today to say that the Australian economy will not be immune to Trump\u2019s policies, such as his plan to raise tariffs. Elsewhere, a University of Queensland study found Facebook \u201ctagged\u201d high-risk people for alcohol- and gambling-related interests, allowing companies to target advertising at them. Battery-powered electrical sales have plunged in Australia as buyers opt for plug-in hybrids. Plus, Russia and Ukraine have traded big drone attacks. Australia Predatory marketing | Vulnerable Australians at high risk of gambling and alcohol problems are being \u201cforce fed\u201d Facebook ads for that content, with experts claiming they are being targeted by social media marketing. Trump plans | Australia\u2019s economy will not be immune from escalating trade tensions, Jim Chalmers has warned, as the Albanese government prepares itself for an incoming Trump administration. Ticket prices | The government must ban dynamic pricing and banish scalpers if consumers are to pay fair prices for concerts, the head of Australia\u2019s largest locally owned ticketing platform says. EV slump | Battery-powered vehicle sales fell sharply last quarter as consumers turn to hybrid models that attract tax concessions, new data shows. Climate change | The WA Labor government appears all but certain to give one of Australia\u2019s biggest greenhouse gas emitters the green light to operate until 2070 after it announced it would abolish state emissions-reduction requirements. World US election | Donald Trump has won the presidential election in Arizona, Associated Press has declared, completing a clean sweep of all seven battleground states and locking in a decisive electoral college victory over the Democratic vice-president, Kamala Harris. Meanwhile, protests against Trump erupted at the weekend as Americans took to the streets in frustration about his re-election. Middle East | There is a \u201cstrong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas\u201d of the northern Gaza Strip, a committee of global food security experts warned on Friday, as Israel claims to be pursuing a military offensive against Palestinian militant group Hamas in the area. Russia | Ukraine has carried out its biggest drone strike on Moscow since Vladimir Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022, Russian media said yesterday, as the Kremlin launched its own record air attack over Ukraine. Spain | The Valencian regional government, which has been heavily criticised over its response to the deadly floods that have killed at least 222 people in Spain, has ruled out any imminent resignations, arguing thatit would constitute a betrayal of the victims of the disaster. The Netherlands | Cold-case detectives hope an innovative lifesize hologram of a young sex worker who was murdered in Amsterdam 15 years ago will jog people\u2019s memories and help bring her killer, or killers, to justice. Full Story Students are drowning in debt. Will Labor\u2019s plan help them? The chief economist at the Australia Institute and Guardian columnist, Greg Jericho, gives his take on why Labor\u2019s plan to slash student debt by 20% next financial year isn\u2019t perfect but why the feigned outrage over \u201cfairness\u201d is wrong. In-depth The Australian men and women who fought as part of the resistance against Franco\u2019s fascist forces ought to have a memorial for their efforts, writes Paul Daley. About 70 Australians joined the International Brigades to oppose the Spanish dictator from 1936 to 1939, with about 16 dying. Given their fight for freedom against tyranny, Daley says it is \u201chigh time\u201d the group is officially commemorated. Not the news Ten years on, what began as a horror film about a single mother being tormented by a creature has become part of queer culture thanks to a viral Internet post. An oral history of The Babadook examines its \u201cvery frenetic, very DIY six-week shoot\u201d, negative test screening feedback and the monster\u2019s enduring status as a gay icon. Sport Cricket | Pakistan have beaten Australia in their one-day international series, their first victory over the country in 22 years. Premier League | Chelsea have drawn with Arsenal at Stamford Bridge, in a battling match with much at stake. Pacific Cup | Australia have shown a ruthless edge to rise above the sea of red and hold off Tonga in a 20-14 Pacific Cup final win. A-League Women | Wellington Phoenix captain Annalie Longo\u2019s dog Tiger has made a surprise cameo at the team\u2019s match against Canberra United. Media roundup Only 29% of voters believe Trump\u2019s victory in the US election will be good for Australia, according to a poll in the Sydney Morning Herald and other Nine papers. Woolworths\u2019 food distribution network may face disruption in the lead-up to Christmas after United Workers Union members in NSW and Victoria endorsed strike action, the Australian reports. The winners of The Block have been announced, with the millionaire Adrian Portelli buying all five houses for about $15m, the Herald Sun reports.

On Friday, Jordan and fellow Republican representative Barry Loudermilk sent a letter to special counsel Jack Smith to demand that his office preserve records of the justice department\u2019s prosecutions of Trump. Asked by CNN whether Trump would go after his political opponents, Jordan said: \u201cHe didn\u2019t do it in his first term. The Democrats went after him and everyone understands what they did. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of that will happen,\u201d Jordan reiterated. \u201cWe are the party who is against political prosecution. We\u2019re the party who is against going after your opponents using lawfare.\u201d Byron Donalds, a Republican congressman from Florida, told Fox News that claims of a list were \u201clies from the Democratic left\u201d. \u201cI will tell you, this is not something that Donald Trump has ever spoken to, or he\u2019s committed to, whatsoever. There\u2019s no enemies list,\u201d Donalds said. Trump has regularly referred to his political opponents as \u201cthe enemy within\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Right, here\u2019s the match report from David Hytner at Stamford Bridge and with that, this minute-by-minute will close. We now bid farewell to Premier League football for two weeks with the November international break to begin. It\u2019s going to be a long old fortnight folks \u2013 here\u2019s hoping you get by without that dose of domestic goodness. We\u2019ll see you soon. This was a key moment for Arsenal right at the death. Wow, wow. Cucurella speaks about \u2018winning\u2019 the battle versus Bukayo Saka. It was about 50-50 in my book but there you go: \u201cWe know he\u2019s a special talent but I tried to give my all to the team, to do my job\". Neto and Cucurella chat to Sky Sports after the game. Neto says Chelsea \u201care not as happy as we wanted to be \u2026 but it\u2019s a good point against a good team\u201d. Cucurella agrees. \u201cWe need to keep going this way, we\u2019re doing well, we need to try and push on,\u201d he says. Complain all you like about Mikel Arteta\u2019s style but \u2026 Cucurella received the broadcasters\u2019 Man of the Match award but I cannot agree with that. Wesley Fofana and Moises Caicedo were Chelsea\u2019s standout players, and it\u2019s hard to look past the returning hero Martin \u00d8degaard when trying to pick out Arsenal\u2019s best player. A breathless final half hour comes to a close, with both teams doing enough to earn a point but no more. Arsenal looked to have taken the initiative through Martinelli but were soon pegged back by Pedro Neto\u2019s wonder-strike. It was hard to call a winner from thereon in and so it ends all-square. Neither side will be particularly happy with that, although neither will be too displeased either. It leaves Chelsea in third and Arsenal in fourth, level on points. 90 min + 4: The last chance of the game will most likely go to Chelsea. They\u2019re attacking after winning a free-kick around 40 yards out. It comes to nothing. And then Arsenal have a great chance at the death with Saliba squaring from the left but nobody is there to tap it home. Trossard got a feint touch. 90 min + 3: Saliba is offside after Arsenal work the corner short. Now here come Chelsea \u2026 you can\u2019t say they\u2019re not giving it a go. 90 min + 2: Palmer nearly latches onto a tantalising ball by Neto, curled in with his left foot from the right. Not quite for Chelsea. Then Arsenal win a corner after good play from \u00d8degaard. He\u2019s been good on his return to the starting lineup. 90 min: It\u2019s only five minutes to be added on. Trossard may have been offside for that previous chance, but he would not have known that at the time. Chelsea are pushing here. My bet is six added minutes. Let\u2019s see \u2026 89 min: Nkunku is on for Chelsea. Not long for him to make an impact. 88 min: It\u2019s getting a bit messy and loose in possession again \u2026 but it\u2019s Arsenal who have just squandered an almighty chance to win it. Leo Trossard, what have you done? The substitute has blazed over from six yards with the goal gaping. 87 min: With the darkness of a long November international break looming after this game finishes, a silver late ray of light from one of these two teams would be welcomed by the Premier League neutrals. Of course, a point isn\u2019t a terrible result for either side. 84 min: There\u2019s some chaos in the Arsenal box, but Raya eventually hangs on after Jackson\u2019s header. Are we in for a grandstand finish here? 82 min: Reece James is on for Gusto as Chelsea switch things around at the back. An email from Peter Oh matched my Neto pun. He went with: \u201cChelsea\u2019s high Net(o) spend policy is paying dividends.\u201d 80 min: Concerning news for Arsenal on the injury front \u2013 again. Saka is sitting down on the ground, seemingly hurt. Not sure if it was the clatter from Cucurella or something muscular. The Chelsea man has been booked, in any case. Gabriel Jesus has been quickly ushered on for Saka. 78 min: Partey gives it away cheaply to Gusto, with Jackson then racing down the right but crossing to nobody in particular. It\u2019s pretty open now, both teams sensing the chance to win it. A Net(o) buster. Nicolas Jackson has the ball in the net for Chelsea but he was an absolute mile offside. And he knew it. 75 min: Credit to both sides, here, the game looked like it was sliding away into the abyss, but they\u2019ve pulled it back tremendously with two good goals and 20 minutes of excellent football. 74 min: Merino goes close again! This time he does actually make contact with it, as Sanchez sprawls to collect. Arsenal have responded to the Chelsea goal. 73 min: Mikel Merino, who is on for Arsenal in the place of Rice, almost has a tap-in for his first touch. The ball into the box just evaded the Spain international. If anyone is in the vicinity of Gary Neville at Stamford Bridge, chuck him a Strepsil. Pedro Neto had just tried a left-footed shot that was blocked\u2026 seconds later he decided to go again, lower, harder and more accurate this time, bursting the net behind Raya in the Arsenal goal. Maresca jumps for joy on the sidelines. Game on! Oh talk about a bolt from the blue! Maybe it is happening for Chelsea. Pedro Neto with a thunderbolt from range! 70 min: Fofana drives forward from defence and Havertz \u2013 now sporting a black bandana \u2013 bundles into the back of the Frenchman. Enzo hoists the resulting free-kick into the box and it\u2019s Neto whose shot is deflected out for a corner in the end. Not quite happening for Chelsea here. 67 min: A delay in play will allow Chelsea to bring on Fern\u00e1ndez and Mudryk, with Lavia \u2013 who\u2019d picked up a knock \u2013 replaced, along with Madueke. 66 min: Arsenal win it high up, with Colwill caught in possession, and Chelsea look rather rattled at the moment. Timber then wriggles through midfield and unleashes a decent shot, which is whizzed just wide. 65 min: Maresca, you might need to utilise your embarrassment of riches on the bench some time soon. Nkunku? F\u00e9lix? Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez? 63 min: It was a goal that didn\u2019t appear forthcoming, but surely it must now jolt Chelsea into life. They\u2019d probably looked the more likely to break the deadlock \u2026 Saka is finally getting some joy against Cucurella. And all the noise is now coming from the Arsenal contingent. 61 min: That came from some fine interplay between Partey and \u00d8degaard, with the latter dinking a delightful ball to Martinelli, who was in acres. The Brazilian ignores the passing option, which was Saka, and slips it past Sanchez at his near post. THERE\u2019S THE SPARK THIS GAME NEEDED. It\u2019s superbly worked to the back post and Martinelli applies the cute finish. \u201cMichael Oliver, it\u2019s all about you,\u201d is the chant from the stands. Eesh. 57 mins: This is turning into a really difficult watch, I won\u2019t lie. Both teams seem more interested in winding each other \u2013 and the referee \u2013 up, rather than playing ball. The game is there for someone to take it, if they want it. 55 min: Chelsea scream for a penalty for a foul on Gusto but both Oliver and VAR turn the claims away. Havertz has blood coming from his head so will have to go off for a bit. Arsenal\u2019s most recent Premier League away goal was in September. Sean Orlowicz emails in: \u201cIt looks like two strong teams that are both just a rung below title contenders.\u201d 53 min: Oh, close for Fofana. Madueke floats a nice ball into the mixer and Fofana \u2013 still up from the corner \u2013 extends a leg to try and volley it home. It\u2019s an awkward one for him, and it\u2019s over the bar. 52 min: Palmer shows a bit of urgency again and wins his team a corner. The Mancunian whips it in with his left but it doesn\u2019t beat the first man. Groans. 51 min: Saka gets the better of Cu-cu-cu-rella this time, cuts into the centre and Arsenal work it quickly to the opposite flank, from which position Martinelli curls a lovely ball towards the back post. But nobody in an Arsenal shirt gambles to get onto it. Martinelli goes again but it\u2019s snuffed out by Fofana. The Chelsea centre-back has been excellent. 49 min: Yep, it\u2019s Chelsea who seemed to have upped the ante since the interval, with some impetus coming down their flanks. There\u2019s a bit more zip in their passing, too. Madueke cuts inside off the right but balloons his shot into orbit. 47 min: Palmer with an injection of pace and directness down the Chelsea left, but his cross is well claimed by Raya. There\u2019s little sign of an increased tempo from Arsenal, who are seeing lots of the ball. Second half: Will this game ignite in the next 45 (to 50) minutes? Let\u2019s hope so. We\u2019re back under way and it\u2019ll be the same players \u2013 for now \u2013 charged with improving on the first half fare. After my bold pre-match prediction that this would be a \u201ccorker\u201d, you\u2019re happily telling me otherwise on email. This is from Rick Harris: This game is an absolute stinker \u2013 can\u2019t see either team scoring but I imagine one of them will get a lucky deflection or a dead soft penalty in the second half and then the other team will equalise with an equally jammy fluke. Oh, Kai. The half finishes with another Palmer free-kick struck straight into the wall. Frustrating stuff for Chelsea, as the whistles goes with the score goalless. What started as a high-quality, high-octane half of football lost a fair degree of momentum some point after the 20-minute mark. Both teams have fashioned decent chances, but the tempo has dropped as both teams\u2019 discipline has dropped. Chelsea need to get Cole Palmer on the ball more often and Arsenal, I\u2019d suggest, need to keep their heads and stop committing unnecessary fouls. More needed in this London derby, please. 45 min: On the brink of the break, Chelsea have a free-kick in a great spot \u2026 but Palmer fires it left-footed into the wall from 20 yards. We\u2019ll have three minutes of stoppage time. Unless something happens in the final minute or so, plus added time, this will be the major talking point of the first half at Stamford Bridge. 43 min: If there\u2019s been one player on either side who has struggled to get involved so far, it\u2019s Nicolas Jackson. Chelsea simply haven\u2019t got the ball to him, either into his feet or via the ball in-behind Arsenal. Hence, Chelsea\u2019s goal threat has been minimal in this first half. 40 min: Palmer, who has looked a bit frustrated in the past 10 to 15 minutes, wallops a free-kick into the Shed End. That was way off target \u2013 he allows himself a wry smile. 39 min: Neto and White come to blows near the Chelsea left-hand touchline after a push in the back from the Arsenal man. Saka then stops Cucurella in his tracks and White is booked for a flaying hand on Neto off the ball. Soft, that. 37 min: It feels like Arsenal have got to grips with Chelsea now and they\u2019re ensuring Palmer doesn\u2019t see too much of the ball, which is key. The home side are sitting deep right now. In the era of VAR, these things can come back to bite you \u2026 34 min: Neto has been booked for dissent. Chelsea\u2019s chief complaint there was that they weren\u2019t ready for the free-kick. But the whistle had gone and, if Havertz hadn\u2019t been offside, the goal would have stood! 33 min: Havertz is indeed ruled offside. There wasn\u2019t a huge amount in it, but he was definitely just the wrong side of the line when it was drawn up. A big cheer goes up around Stamford Bridge. The Chelsea\u2019s defenders\u2019 blushes are spared. They switched off at the taking of that free-kick. Arsenal free kick. Taken quickly and smartly \u2013 and Kai Havertz smuggles it in! Oooh is this offside though? There will be a VAR check. 30 min: Many thought it would be an even-money game before kick-off and it\u2019s proving that way. Chelsea are just shading things, for me. 28 min: Looking back at that Martinelli chance, it fell kindly to him after Saka\u2019s shot was blocked and the Brazilian hit it too close to the Chelsea goalkeeper, who got in the way. 27 min: A good defensive header from Caicedo flicks Saka\u2019s cross away from trouble. Martinelli is then found in space but hits it straight at Sanchez from close-ish range. Arsenal are looking decent through midfield but are lacking in cutting edge. 25 min: It looks like Gusto has hurt himself while missing that header and he\u2019s now getting some treatment inside the Arsenal goal area. Reece James is summoned to start a warmup. Could be a bit of a delay. 24 min: Madueke is looking like a good outlet for Chelsea on the right, stretching his legs whenever possibly to run at Timber. On the other side, Neto delivers a superb cross with his left foot and Gusto heads over. That was a big chance \u2013 he really should have scored. Raya was beaten. 22 min: Dear Michael Oliver, stop delaying the taking of every set piece to have a sincere chat with anyone who dares push into anyone else in the penalty box. Yours, everyone watching. 21 min: Cucurella v Saka was a battle for the ages in the Euros final and round two is proving just as captivating so far. Colwill is rightly booked for a scything challenge on the England winger. Got nowhere near the ball. 20 min: First Caicedo does brilliantly to bring it away from trouble and then Palmer does a Palmer, turning cutely away from his man before driving forward. It ends with Madueke heading wide from Neto\u2019s cross. Better from the Chels. 18 min: Caicedo has absolutely flattened \u00d8degaard and he\u2019s somehow escaped without a booking. Palmer is complaining to the referee about something or other. 17 min: Gary Neville has been talking about Arsenal\u2019s need for \u201cinvention and creativity\u201d on the UK broadcast and there\u2019s been a hint of that in the past few minutes. They\u2019re certainly controlling matters right now. 14 mins: Saka hustles back, hassles Caicedo and wins it for Arsenal high up the pitch. The Gunners then work it down the right with White teasing in a cross that nobody can latch onto. They\u2019re coming back into this now, after a slow-ish opening 10 minutes. 12 min: Chelsea aren\u2019t offering much bite from their set-pieces. Methinks the away side will rely on those dead-ball situations a little more, given their superb record. 10 min: Arsenal\u2019s first set-piece of the game, a corner from the left, is won by Gabriel \u2013 with Rice getting a second chance to hook it in following a few handbags in the Chelsea box. Caicedo is furious at Havertz for going down. Six of one \u2026 When the ball finally comes in, it nearly falls for Ben White at the back post. Chelsea just about clear and counter. 8 min: Enzo Maresca has obviously deemed Reece James unworthy of a starting spot today and that\u2019s completely understandable. Malo Gusto is far more comfortable on the right and is having a big say already in this game, with Cucurella a more natural fit at left-back. 6 min: Chelsea are breaking lines with relative ease at the moment, as Palmer starts to pick up possession in the hole. 5 min: The first few minutes of this game have been played at a frightening pace. Finally there\u2019s some calm with Chelsea\u2019s defenders on the ball, waiting for the Gunners\u2019 press. 3 min: Madueke surges down the right and feeds the onrushing Gusto, who has bust a gut to get to the byline. Palmer then has a pot-shot to sting David Raya\u2019s fingertips. The keeper does well to tip it over the bar. Two more emails as the early knockings are played out. Chelsea fan Krishnamoorthy: \u201cIf Chelsea wins today, we will be 3rd on the table. I do not remember when was the last time we were that high on the table for a two week period. Makes me giddy that even a draw would guarantee that. I do hope the backroom staff of Arsenal have lost the Cole Palmer voodoo doll for this afternoon.\u201d Charles Antaki of an Arsenal persuasion: \u201cOn the one hand, yes, great to see the A-Team back for the Arsenal; on the other hand, Arsenal fans will have palpitations every time \u00d8degaard or Rice goes down, grimaces or just stands about with his hands on his hips looking pensive. Are they sufficiently recovered? Will they totter about ineffectively before collapsing or being taken off? It\u2019s a fine line between anticipation and angst, although I suppose the A in A-Team could stand for either of those two things. Awkward, perhaps.\u201d After a period of silence and the sounding of the Last Post on Remembrance Sunday, we\u2019re off and running Stamford Bridge. A roar greets the sound of the referee\u2019s whistle. The ref is Michael Oliver, incidentally. Today\u2019s match reports so far: Some emails are dropping in my inbox ahead of kick-off: Joe Pearson says: \u201cGood morning, Dom, from a rather gloomy and overcast Indianapolis. As a Liverpool fan, a high-scoring draw would be just what the doctor ordered. Please deliver. Thanks!\u201d Jeff Sax adds: \u201cI have been saying for two years that Arteta does not have what it takes to win the Premier League \u2026\u201d The Chelsea double midfield fulcrum of Mois\u00e9s Caicedo and Rom\u00e9o Lavia has been gaining deserved plaudits lately and it\u2019ll be fascinating to see how they fare against top-drawer opposition. Caicedo impressed last week at Manchester United but Lavia wasn\u2019t able to dictate the game like he has been doing. The latter is just 20 so his ceiling is sky-high and today feels like a decent test of his credentials. The two managers have been speaking ahead of kick-off and you can watch their musings here: Will Chelsea and Arsenal be among the inevitably long list of suitors for Viktor Gy\u00f6keres in the summer? With Ruben Amorim, United will consider themselves favourites but the two London clubs may be after a prolific No.9. Before this weekend, Manchester United and Newcastle were supposedly struggling, Nottingham Forest were flying and Tottenham were gathering major momentum. Today: Manchester United win 3-0 Newcastle win 3-1 at Forest Tottenham lose at home to Ipswich Greatest league in the world. Does this mark a return to the days of Sky Sports\u2019 \u2018GRAND SLAM SUNDAY\u2019 branding? Let\u2019s hope so. Barring a 3-0 win at Preston in the Carabao Cup, it\u2019s been a lean old run for Arsenal since the previous international break \u2013 especially away from home. The Gunners have blanked at Bournemouth, Inter and Newcastle, a streak of defeats that has prompted questions over Mikel Arteta\u2019s tactics and the team\u2019s general fluency. Will the return of \u00d8degaard prove panacea for all those problems? Barney Ronay doubts it. We\u2019re into the final 30 minutes of the earlier kick-offs: So everyone starts, injury doubt or not! Palmer is probably not a huge surprise. Maresca has played his cards fairly close to his chest in recent press conferences when asked about the playmaker\u2019s fitness and was helped by the fact Palmer isn\u2019t in Chelsea\u2019s Conference League squad. He should be fit and firing to take centre-stage today. Reece James drops to the Blues\u2019 bench with Cucurella preferred and Gusto going to right-back. The bigger worry is over Arsenal\u2019s injured contingent, with Declan Rice apparently playing despite a broken toe and \u00d8degaard only just back from a long-standing ankle issue. The positive upshot for both sides \u2013 and the neutrals \u2013 is two benches packed with potential game-changers: F\u00e9lix, Nkunku, Trossard, Jesus \u2026 oooft. Chelsea (4-2-3-1): S\u00e1nchez; Gusto, Fofana, Colwill, Cucurella; Lavia, Caicedo; Madueke, Palmer, Neto; Jackson. Subs: Jorgensen, Badiashile, James, Tosin, Veiga, Fern\u00e1ndez, Mudryk, J.F\u00e9lix, Nkunku. Arsenal (4-3-3): Raya; White, Saliba, Gabriel, Timber; Rice, Partey, \u00d8degaard; Saka, Havertz, Martinelli. Subs: Neto, Kiwior, Zinchenko, Lewis-Skelly, Merino, Jorginho, Nwaneri, Trossard, Jesus. With official team news due at 3.15pm, we await news on several key midfielders. Arsenal fans will be desperate to see Declan Rice and Martin \u00d8degaard. Word is both players have arrived at Stamford Bridge, along with Kai Havertz and Mikel Merino who both picked up knocks in Milan in midweek. Chelsea\u2019s concerns centre around Cole Palmer, who was on the end of a bash from Lisandro Martinez at Manchester United last weekend, but the general consensus seems to be that Palmer will be fine. He\u2019d arguably be the biggest miss of the lot. Here\u2019s some pre-match reading for you. It\u2019s the headline game of the weekend without doubt, and a rarity in being a clash between two elite teams that is so difficult to predict. There are cases to be made for both sides. Chelsea, one of the Premier League\u2019s in-form sides, are fresh off an 8-0 victory and have built renewed hope under Enzo Maresca of late; although Arsenal, albeit they have been disjointed and tetchy of late, have the pedigree of having pushed for the title in the past two seasons \u2013 during which time Chelsea finished down in mid-table. There are some mouthwatering individual contests to observe that will decide the contest. Will Nicolas Jackson win the battle against William Saliba? Can Declan Rice shackle Cole Palmer (if the latter is fit)? And could Chelsea\u2019s new-look, all-action midfield rule the roost or will Martin \u00d8degaard (if fit) provide the Gunners a timely boost in that area? Official team news is coming up soon, kick-off is at 4.30pm GMT (UK time). Should be a good\u2019un.",

At least five Syriza deputies are expected to officially inform parliament on Monday of their decision to leave the party, a move that will result in the group\u2019s parliamentary presence being reduced to 30 lawmakers \u2013 one fewer than the centre-left Pasok. \u201cSyriza is about to lose its status as the main opposition,\u201d said Stelios Kouloglou, a prominent former Syriza MEP. \u201cStefanos Kasselakis, the man who many saw as the messiah, will be remembered as the gravedigger who ultimately buried the [party\u2019s] corpse that died under his watch.\u201d In office between 2015 and 2019, the leftwing Syriza controlled 35 seats as the main opposition bloc in the 300-seat house. Its implosion means Pasok, whose standing went into freefall as the force most associated with causing the nation\u2019s nearly decade-long economic crisis, will move into second place under its newly re-elected leader, Nikos Androulakis. As the main opposition, it will face the centre-right government of the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis. The development follows the ousting of Kasselakis from Syriza\u2019s leadership post and his decision on Saturday to not only formally break with the party but create \u201ca movement of democracy, free citizens and progress\u201d. The country\u2019s first openly gay party leader, Kasselakis, who moved to the US as a teenager and had never worked in Greece before, had emerged seemingly out of nowhere to assume the position after Syriza\u2019s defeat in double elections last year, succeeding the previous leader and former prime minister Alexis Tsipras. Kasselakis was controversially barred at the start of a rowdy party congress on Friday from again contesting the leadership, a decision denounced by his supporters as undemocratic. The race is due to take place on 24 November, with a possible second round on 1 December. By Sunday there was mounting confidence among the Greek-American\u2019s followers \u2013 known as Kasselistas \u2013 that as many as eight other MPs would withdraw from Syriza\u2019s parliamentary group.

Leftwing diehards had long voiced disquiet at the political neophyte\u2019s lack of ideological affiliation, with many asking how someone with no known links to Syriza could be elected to its helm. Kasselakis\u2019s lavish lifestyle and erstwhile status as a shipowner and Goldman Sachs financier particularly irked the party\u2019s old-school cohort. The 36-year-old had publicly boasted he had \u201cno need to ever work again\u201d before holding a three-day celebration on Crete in August to mark his wedding to his US partner, Tyler McBeth. Shortly after Kasselakis\u2019s election, 11 Syriza MPs, many decrying the outsider\u2019s \u201cTrumpian practices [and] right-leaning populism\u201d, broke away and set up a splinter group, the New Left. In recent months as infighting has worsened, Syriza\u2019s poll ratings were not only overtaken by Pasok but fell to single digits amid accusations about the \u201cpolitical tourist\u2019s\u201d popularity being based on little more than a social media presence and dress code that focused on showing off his body. On Monday Syriza said it would request that the former leader\u2019s wealth declaration \u2013 a source of widespread contention \u2013 justifying his assets, income and alleged participation in offshore companies be officially investigated. \u201cIn these hours, Stefanos Kasselakis, with the undivided support of other centres is waging an all-out battle for Syriza\u2019s parliamentary group to lose its position as official opposition,\u201d the party wrote on Sunday in a post on X. \u201cAs for the unrelenting and unanswered questions about his wealth declaration and offshore [companies], it is clear they should be checked by the competent authorities.\u201d Kasselakis said it was up to supporters to decide what his new progressive movement would be called.

      "bodyText": "Michael Aylwin\u2019s report from Murrayfield has landed so I\u2019ll leave you with that. Thank you for joining me. What a contest, what a privilege to be here. Congrats to the Boks, commiserations to the Scots. As Mchael says, \u201cthey threw everything at this match\u201d. And this from one of Scotland\u2019s best voices tells a different tale: This from a Springboks fan sums it up: Am I being harsh on the Boks? Isn\u2019t winning ugly but still comfortably a sign of a champion side? Here\u2019s what Gregor Townsend told BBC Scotland: A lot of pride in the performance. I thought it was a brilliant Test match - hugely physical. We matched South Africa for a lot of the game and we were down to 14 for 20 minutes. I thought the team looked mentally strong. A couple of skill errors cost us and we didn\u2019t get the rub of the green with decisions, clearly. South Africa then showed their power in the last 10 minutes. That effort in the second half was outstanding. To open up their defence at times and match their physicality. We will be frustrated because there were a couple of opportunities out there. We played one of our best games of the last few years today, and we pushed the world champions very close. There are areas we have to improve, but some of the defence today was world class. The effort that went in is all we want from a Scotland team. We know we could have executed better and had decisions go against us, but they deserved to win, South Africa. All the chat in the press room as we wait to hear from the coaches is along similar lines and asking the same question: How did that happen? Scotland have left this with loads of credit having bossed the breakdown and played some delightful stuff, and yet the lost four tries to nil and by a score of 17. Bryan Habana, on TNT, is heaping praise on the Boks and the Bomb Squad. I think he\u2019s being generous. I think Rassie dodged a bullet there. I think he played his reserves too early and got really lucky that his team managed to keep out Scotland. Then again, when you have a scrum like that, they have a get out of jail trump card. By my count that was four succesive scrum penalties before the final try at the end. With that win, South Africa move back to number one on World Rugby\u2019s rankings. Eben Etzebeth is the man of the match. Here\u2019s what he had to say: Thank you to all the South Africans here tonight. It was a tough Test match, it\u2019s always a tough match against Scotland. It was much closer than the scoreline suggests. We needed to stick together. It was a tough one to start with. Credit to Jerry Flannery for [setting up the defence that once again kept Scotland out] As you might know, I\u2019m South Africa, so of course I\u2019m delighted with that result. But I\u2019m genuinely gutted for the Scots and their supporters. They were magnificent. Tuipulotu, Jones, Jordan and everyone who hammered the breakdown deserved more than a 17-point defeat. The Boks were just too clinical when it mattered and refused to have their own line breached. The scoreline won\u2019t tell the full story but that is a brutal performance from a Boks team that wasn\u2019t quite at the races today. Scotland were brilliant but they still conceded four tries without scoring one of their own. My goodness, what a game which proves how hard it is to beat these world champions. The scrum consumes Scotland\u2019s pack and Wiese, at the back, just has to dot down! Pollard slots the extras. 79th min: South Africa go back to basics after playing it fast following a Scottish spill. Snyman, Marx, du Toit and Etzebeth all carry with vicious intent and they\u2019re five metres out. Scotland slow the ball down illegally and South Africa win a penalty. They choose to take the scrum. 77th min: South Africa go through the forwards before sending it down the backline. Kolisi is prowling in the trams and makes a decent charge. But they can\u2019t quite stitch it together and a loose pass bobbles out for a line-out. Scotland have the throw but inside their own territory. 76th min: South Africa secure the restart and then get the ball back again after a clearing box kick. Another high contestable kicks lands on their side and suddenly they\u2019re securing the ruck around halfway. One more contestable is won by a man in green and they\u2019re into Scotland\u2019s territory. Now on the edge of the 22. They are the masters at securing tight games (England, are you watching?) Pollard slots it from right in front. That could be that unless Scotland do something incredible from here. 73rd min: South Africa predictably win the scrum penalty. Pollard points to the poles. Jordan makes way. He had an outstanding game. 72nd min: South Africa have the scrum feed right under Scotland poles. That\u2019s because Jordan spilled the ball as he swept across to collect a Williams grubber following some big work from the Boks forwards following a line-out win. After defending their own line a moment ago, South Africa have a big opportunity to put this game to bed. 70th min: The Boks win a scrum penalty. Their pack is just so monstrous! They attack with front foot ball. Esterhuizen feeds Pollard who feeds Mapimpi, back on the field. They look sharper with Williams at 9. Pollard kicks to the corner. It\u2019s a good touch finder. They come a long way back fore the scrum penalty. I think that\u2019s a generous advantage. 69th min: Scotland are camped inside South Africa\u2019s 22 thanks to Jordan getting through the line with a quick step. More strong carries keeps the hosts on the front foot. They lose it, but a poor kick from le Roux means the Scots come right back at them. They must score. But South Africa\u2019s defence holds. They\u2019re defending for their lives! A cross-field kick dips quickly on Tuipolotu and he spills it. Scrum for the Boks inside their own half. That\u2019s an impressive show from the Springboks who had almost no right to keep the Scots out there. Mighty defence. Both teams change their scrumhalves. 66th min: South Africa just about secure the restart and Hendrikse boxes. Not very far, but it does go out. Scotland with the lineout about 40 out. Pollard does Pollard things and nails a tough penalty under pressure when his team needed it to go over. 64th min: Scotland infringe at the line-out. Du Toit gathers but he was pulled down in the air. Soft as far as Scotland is concerned. 63rd min: South Africa win a penalty for a change. That\u2019s a big steal from Am who has given his loose forwards a bit of a lesson at the breakdown. Pollard goes for distance and this time finds touch. A Boks line-out just outside of Scotland\u2019s 22 will take place after everyone takes a breather. Dempsey leaves the pitch for Bayliss. Richardson, who plays his club rugby in Durban, is also on the pitch for Ashman. 62nd min: Another penalty on the ground for Scotland. Forget the Bomb Squad. South Africa\u2019s forwards are getting bossed right now. Scotland have all the momentum and an almighty opportunity to win this. Russell kicks to touch and they\u2019ll have the line-out about 25 metres out. Three more points for Scotland. Should they have tried to score a try? Well, they\u2019ve shortened the gap. Pragmatic, but was it wise? 61st min: Scotland can\u2019t secure the line-out five metres out. But it\u2019s another poor kick from South Africa and Kinghorn runs it back. The crowd is going bonkers! Tuipolotu with a big carry and Jordan is through! Oh, why didn\u2019t he pass on his inside? Still they come, though. Schoeman with a short carry. Another penalty under the posts. South Africa look desperate! Rather than scrum, Russell chooses to slot a gimme penalty to shorten the gap. Now South Africa must play with a man down after Mapimpi lost his discipline as he scrambled back to defend. 60th min: South Africa lose the line-out and Scotland attack. They have been electric these past few minutes. Jones beats one, beats another, he keeps going, what a run this is! Can he find support? No, not quite. White comes to sweep up and keep the move alive. Mapimpi strays off side so Scotland have a free hit. South Africa\u2019s defence holds but it\u2019s all Scotland riught now. There\u2019s a spill down on the opposite wing but they\u2019ll come back for the penalty which Russell nudges into the corner. 57th min: Under the shade of their own posts, South Africa\u2019s pack win a scrum penalty. Pollard goes for distance but doesn\u2019t find touch. That\u2019s a poor mistake. So Scotland attack and find an edge on the opposite tram. The floated final pass is just a little too high and sails over van der Merwe\u2019s head and it goes out for a line-out. 56th min: Wonderful play from Scotland off the back of a line-out almost puts van der Merwe through. It needed Etzebeth to grab his shirt to bring him down. But the Scots flood through the hole and they\u2019re collecting down the line. More strong carries. Quick ball from White. Into the 22. Schoeman now. Russell then Jordan. The crowd rises. 10m out. But Fagerson drops it under the poles after Wiese puts him under pressure. 53rd min: ANOTHER handling error from South Africa gifts possession back to Scotland. It\u2019s down in Scottish territory so Scotland opt to kick. But a poor return has Russell lifting a high, awkward spiral bomb that le Roux fails to grab at the first go. When he eventually gets it under control he hoofs a punt towards half-way. South Africa are doing all the running with their big units making gains, but they can\u2019t stitch together enough phases to make those initial bursts count. Scotland\u2019s defence is holding firm and it is them who have the firepower off the bench to come. The Boks have fired all their shots in that regard. 51st min: South Africa\u2019s scrum gets the ascendency but not the penalty. Am collects on the charge and barges over the gainline. Hendrikse \u2013 for the third time \u2013 knocks-on under no pressure and Scotland are countering. A kick ahead is collected by a diving le Roux but Kinghorn loses his feet as he makes the tackle, going over the top and the rest of the Scots follow. Penalty to Scotland and that\u2019s a freebie for the Boks who were under immense pressure in their own 22. 50th min: Scotland give away a free-kick friom their own scrum so South Africa tap and go. First the forwards then quyick hands from le Roux, Pollard and Esterhuizen frees up Am. They keep it going even after an off-load doesn\u2019t stick. Marx carries then le Roux fires a pass over the top and in a flash Mapimpi has it on the opposite wing. He toes ahead but can\u2019t keep it in play. They were playing with an scrum advantage so will pack down around Scotland\u2019s 22. Big moment you feel. 48 min: There\u2019s another knock-on from Hendrikse, this time at the back of a ruck. Pieter-Steph du Toit carries three times and stomps over the gainline with every touch. Snyman battles too but Scotland hold firm and cause chaos at the breakdown yet again. Hendrikse takes his eyes off the ball and Scotland will get the scrum feed. 46th min: There\u2019s another heft carry from Esterhuizen off first phase ball before a clever off0load to Am. South Africa creep into Scotland\u2019s 22 before a grubber ahead into the corner needs cleaning up by Jordan. He\u2019s soon swamped by men in green but Scotland help him out and secure the ball. The clearing kick doesn\u2019t clear the 22 so the Boks get line-out. And here comes the Bomb Squad. Six subs. The front row, the back row and a few others. There\u2019s a knock on by Hendrikse at the back of the maul from the line-out \u2013 which is a real missed opportunity \u2013 and then both teams get into a bit of pushing and shoving which wakes the crowd up! And South Africa concede the penalty for losing their heads. An excellent outcome for the Scots. The lead is cut to seven as Russell maintains his perfect record from the tee. 42nd min: Tuipolotu hammers the line off first phase ball from the scrum. He\u2019s a monster! Russell switches the direction of play and almost chucks an intercept, but there\u2019s another knock-on by a man in green and Scotland get the scrum and then the scrum penalty inside South Africa\u2019s 22. Russell points to the sticks. 41st min: Smith spills the restart so Scotland have the feed on SA\u2019s 22. RG Snyman was a half-time switch for Franco Mostert. The teams are back out. Scotland have done well to stay within touching distance and could have been closer had they not had a try scrapped from the ledger. Can they continue to front up once the Boks reserves make their way onto the park. We\u2019ll soon find out. \u201cThat second [Springboks] try was beautiful. It felt like ultimate frisbee,\u201d says Craig Hart. Not sure what he means exactly. But thanks for writing in Craig! \u201cA good game,\u201d says my colleague, Michael Aylwin, next to me. Just shows how two people can watch the same match and come up with different takes. My view is that it\u2019s been a mess. But that\u2019s because both teams are hammering the breakdown like zealots. Two excellent kicks \u2013 from Pollard and le Roux \u2013 for Mapimpi\u2019s tries, and some big carries from Esterhuizen aside, the Boks haven\u2019t offered much. Scotland really needed that try. And they deserved it as it was the first bit of quality from either backline. You feel they needed to be closer at the break before the Bomb Squad comes on but Scotland deserve credit for not being blown away having spent 20 minutes of that half a man down. South Africa escape with a 10-point lead. Boos ring out but it was the right call. Jones did knock-on. Adding insult to injury Scotland give away a penalty but Pollard fails to find touch. Van der Merwe collects inside his 22 and nudges it out. A mad half comes to an end. THERE\u2019S A KNOCK-ON! White scores a classic scrum-half\u2019s try as he provides support on the inside of Jordan who cut through a gap to break open the South African defensive line. Except he hasn\u2019t. Because, after Tuipulotu made a barnstorming carry, there\u2019s a knock on from Jones in the build up. So cruel for the Scots. 37th min: Scotland lose their feet on the deck at the breakdown after the restart and South Africa have a pressure reliving penalty inside their own 22. But the Scots will have a scrum feed on halfway after a knock-on a few seconds later. It\u2019s been that sort of game. Scrappy, messy, pretty ugly to be honest. Another one for Mapimpi! A monster scrum gives the Boks front foot ball. They go down the line with Esterhuizen and Am combining before Hendrikse shifts it back where it came from. Le Roux plays a delicious kick over the top and Mapimpi runs onto it before scoring in the corner. Brilliant play but where was Scotland\u2019s defence? Pollard converts and suddenly there\u2019s daylight between the sides. 34th min: Every time one team takes some momentum they give it away. Scotland give away a soft scrum after securing the restart on the 22 after White takes too long to kick at the back of a ruck. Russell makes no mistake and South Africa\u2019s sixth penalty conceded is punished. 32nd min: This has been a chaotic game. Both teams are throwing absolutely everything at the breakdown and Scotland are winning that battle. They win a penalty shortly after the restart just beyond South Africa\u2019s 10m line. Max Williamson comes onto the pitch after Cummings\u2019 20 minute red card ends. From nothing! South Africa, for the third time this Test, make a mess of the line-out, but a lucky bobble has the ball fall for Thomas du Toit who runs in an easy score. Pollard converts and the Boks are back in front against the run of play. 30th min: South Africa find themselves within touching distance of the Scottish line thanks to a clever dink from le Roux and a lucky bounce of the ball that bobbles over Jordan and Moodie is almost in. Scotland secure the ball but the clearing box kick from White doesn\u2019t go long and the Boks will have the line-out inside Scotland\u2019s 22. 28th min: Scotland make yards with short carries around the fringe. That opens space for Russell in the pocket who drops at goal but Mostert charges it down. Scotland win the ball back and have a dart down the short side. But they can\u2019t hold onto it and a break from Mapimpi has South Africa cantering up field. 26th min: Scotland win the line-out and are happy to play the kick challenge. Moodie runs it up but is met with resistance. South Africa kick, Scotland return it. When the Boks have the final say it\u2019s a big territorial win for the home side who\u2019ll have the line-out feed around the Boks\u2019 22. 24 min: South Africa finally win a line-out and get a rolling maul on. They go down the line after the rumble stalls before Etzebethe is SMOKED by Ashman. Moodie gets a poor pass floated over to him, knocks it on and then the Boks concede yet another breakdown penalty. You\u2019d never guess it but it\u2019s South Africa with the man advantage. Scotland take the lead! And you know what, they deserve it. South Africa, apart from the try, have not been at it yet. 21st min: South Africa\u2019s scrum motors through the Scottish pack but White gets it in and out very quickly. There\u2019s a kick down field and Moodie runs it back, but another penalty is blown against the Boks as the winger holds on. Russll within range here. 20th min: This time South Africa win the free-kick from the scrum but instantly cough up possession. Hendrikse taps and goes quickly but chucks a tough pass to Smith who shells it. 19 min: Am has the ball knocked loose from his grasp so Scotland have a scrum inside their own patch. South Africa just haven\u2019t clicked across the backline yet. Another chance to scrum though. Cummings\u2019 yellow has been upgraded! Scotland now have to play with a man down for a total of 20 minutes. Scotland are up and running. And they deserve that. Great physicality from Scotland. 16th min: Poor from South Africa. They go too early in the scrum so give away a free-kick. Then, after Pollard is sat down by Tuipolotu with a mighty carry, Mostert obstructs the chasers from a high kick. Russell will now get a chance at an easy three. 15th min: Another clean line-out win from Scotland has them on the front foot. A high kick into South Africa\u2019s 22 causes some problems for Mapimpi but a kind bounce has it back on the side of the Boks. Shortly after there\u2019s a spill around half-way and Scotland will have the scrum feed. Can Scotland hold without a member of their tight five? 12th min: South Africa win their line-out and go down the line and then back. Scotland\u2019s defence holds before le Roux kicks to touch around the 22. Esterhuizen is having a strong game providing some neat link-up play in midfield. Scotland win their line-out and then a penalty after the Boks collapse the maul. If they can keep South Africa scoreless for 10 minutes they\u2019ll be well pleased. The officials are taking a long look at the big screen. Cummings has crocodile-rolled Mostert away from a ruck and that\u2019s a clear penalty. Definite yellow card despite the boos. 11th min: Scotland win a penalty within range after a tackler doesn\u2019t roll away. Earlier in the move Jones unfurled a pass through his legs to keep the backline ranging right and then left. Better tempo from the Scots and this should be an easy three for Russell. 10th min: The crowd rises as Van der Merwe gets the ball in some space down the left wing, but he\u2019s monstered into touch by several Boks. Mbonambi misses his jumper \u2013 that\u2019s two in a row that the Boks haf fluffed. 9th min: A cute dink off the boot puts the ball inside South Africa\u2019s 22 and Moodie has to mop up with a wriggle of his hips. A messy few minutes from both sides ends with a line-out for Scotland around half-way. 6th min: Scotland win a penalty inside their own half after a Hendirkse up and under puts it back after the restart. Russell kicks to touch but doesn\u2019t get a lot of ground so Scotland will have to attack from a line-out 10m into South Africa\u2019s territory. But it\u2019s a mess. In a flash the Boks get the ball back with a line-out of their own. But then Scotland pinch the ball\u2026 what a scrappy passage. The Boks are on the board! It\u2019s a great finish from Mapimpi in the left corner following a perfect cross-field kick-pass from Pollard. The base was set from a maul and Pollard had the licence to chance his luck with a penalty advantage. Brilliant from South Africa. Pollard fails with the conversion. 5th min: Scotland are targeting the breakdown and a strong counter ruck almost wins the ball back around half-way. But a tackler doesn\u2019t roll away so it\u2019s a Boks penalty which Pollard hoofs into the corner around six metres from the line. Great kick. 3rd min: Pollard finds space in the backfield but Duhan scampers back and makes a good mark on the dive. His clearing kick gives South Africa a line-out 10m inside Scottish territory. 2nd min: South Africa kick-off. White box-kicks back and South Africa attack. Smith with a run before Pollard hoists high. The Boks secure the ball back and attack down the line before Mapimpi makes inroads into Scottish territory. A Scottish supporter, who wants to remain anonymous, has this chilling message: \u201cBy far the most likely way to get a Scotland win in this match is if a key Springbok player is sent off permanently at an early stage in the game.\u201d Not an optimistic outlook, but realistic perhaps. My goodness, Flower of Scotland is an absolute tune! Credit to the crowd, and the band, and the players, and whoever wrote the song. I loved that! If the 23 representing Scotland can match that they\u2019ll hammer the world champions. Anthems now\u2026 two of the best in world rugby. It\u2019s Remembrance Sunday so we\u2019ll start with some bagpipes and a moment of silence. The players are lining up in the tunnel. Kwagga Smith is leading the Boks out on his 50th appearance for his country. Bryan Habana says that this is the best collection of Springboks in South Africa\u2019s history. He also said that it\u2019s the best cluster of Scots of all time. Should be a belter then. Here\u2019s Sarah Rendell\u2019s report from Cardiff on a historic win for Fiji: What are your thoughts on the 7-1 bench split? Does anyone out there feel that it\u2019s against the spirit of rugby? Rassie Erasmus, full of smiles, admits that his rotated side is a consequence of the short six-day turnaround before the England match. A few weeks ago, he was doing his best to convince Gerard Meager that his brutal Boks are actually a bunch of lovable blokes. Anyone buying it? The crowd is filling up around me and there are a load of Saffas in attendance. The streets of Edinburgh were awash with green jerseys. They\u2019re not the majority \u2013 I\u2019d say it\u2019s a 70-30 split \u2013 but they\u2019ll fanatically cheer every South African point. With Wales losing to Fiji, Scotland are the only European side to beat a southern hemisphere outfit in five Tests this Autumn. Surprised? You shouldn\u2019t be. Not if you read my preview of the four southern hemisphere giants (Fiji not included). Missed it, did you? I\u2019ve got you covered: Some of you might have noticed my slip when I reported on the Scotland team. It\u2019s fixed now, thanks to Allan MacDonald, who wrote in to help me out. Allan also had some thoughts on Jordan at full-back: Quite surprised he went to full back when Rowe went off last week, but I suppose Scotland use their fullback as a second playmaker often and with Kinghorn also able to fill that role it might keep the South African rush defence guessing for that crucial split second. (I can hope!!) Fiji have just beaten Wales! 24-19 in Cardiff. It\u2019s Wales\u2019 10th successive defeat, their joint-worst ever run. Rassie Erasmus and his Boks have on the charm offensive this Autumn. But is it working? Michael Aylwin ain\u2019t buying it. But, as our man says, it\u2019s not necessary. The Boks have earned their reputation as the bad boys of the game. Why not embrace it? It\u2019s a seven-one split on the bench with only Grant Williams \u2013 a scrum-half-cum-winger \u2013 the lone back among the subs. There are some heavy hitters who\u2019ll be expected to add some heft later on, but don\u2019t think of the starters as lightweight. That\u2019s a very mobile back row who\u2019ll look to stifle Scotland\u2019s ball. And with Andre Esterhuizen rampaging down the inside centre lane, the Boks will still pack a punch from the opening whistle. South Africa: Wille le Roux; Canan Moodie, Lukhanyo Am, Andre Esterhuizen, Makazole Mapimpi; Handre Pollard, Jaden Hendrikse; Ox Nche, Bongi Mbonambi, Thomas du Toit, Eben Etzebeth (c), Franco Mostert, Marco van Staden, Elrigh Louw, Kwagga Smith. Replacements: Malcolm Marx, Gerhard Steenkamp, Vincent Koch, RG Snyman, Siya Kolisi, Pieter-Steph du Toit, Jasper Wiese, Grant Williams. A few big names, including Fin Russell, Ben White and Blair Kinghorn return to the side. New Zealand-born Tom Jordan makes his first start for his adopted country at full-back. He\u2019s usually a midfielder, and his deployment in the backfield, with Kinghorn out wide, could be a sign of Scotland\u2019s intention to hoist the ball high. Then again, it could just be that Darcy Graham is out injured. Scotland: Tom Jordan; Blair Kinghorn, Huw Jones, Sione Tuipulotu (c), Duhan van der Merwe; Finn Russell, Ben White; Pierre Schoeman, Ewan Ashman, Zander Fagerson, Grant Gilchrist, Scott Cummings, Matt Fagerson, Rory Darge, Jack Dempsey. Replacements: Dylan Richardson, Rory Sutherland, Elliot Millar Mills, Max Williamson, Josh Bayliss, Jamie Ritchie, Jamie Dobie, Stafford McDowall. So far it\u2019s been a clean sweep for the Rugby Championship sides over their Six Nations rivals. The New Zealand All Blacks edged England and then kept Ireland at arm\u2019s length. Australia won a thriller at Twickenham before Argentina routed Italy. Now the double world champion Springboks take aim at Scotland with Gregor Townsend\u2019s team the last hope for those who hold onto the belief that Europe\u2019s best have the measure of the southern hemisphere giants. Scotland have not beaten South Africa since 2010 in a run that stretches across 10 Tests. They were outmuscled in their last meeting at last year\u2019s World Cup and though they have the razzle-dazzle to cut any defensive line to shreds, it\u2019s where cauliflowered ears meet bloodied foreheads where this game will likely be decided. Can Scotland front up to the Bomb Squad, as South Africa\u2019s meaty replacements have been dubbed since their 2019 World Cup triumph? Perhaps they can. But what about a Nuclear Squad? Rassie Erasmus has named seven forwards on the bench including regular captain Siya Kolisi and the former World Player of the Year, Pieter-Steph du Toit. If Scotland can get enough front-foot ball for Finn Russell, and if they can handle the heft of the Boks pack, and if they can establish a large enough lead to nullify the impact of the South African bench, then maybe, possibly, they have a serious chance of a mighty upset. That\u2019s a lot of ifs, but if there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned from the Autumn Nations Series so far it\u2019s that we should expect the unexpected. How good\u2019s international rugby at the minute!? Another cracker awaits! I\u2019m at Murrayfield and I can\u2019t wait to get going. Drop me a mail if you\u2019ve got any thoughts you\u2019d like to share. Kick-off at 4:10pm GMT. Teams and further updates to come.",

The college\u2019s Military and Protective Services Academy said he was a \u201cmodel student\u201d with a \u201cstrong moral compass\u201d in a tribute on Facebook. \u201cHe was a passionate, articulate and bright student, who was keen to learn, with a strong moral compass,\u201d the post said. \u201cHe was very proud of his family history in the services. \u201cHe was well liked and respected by his peers, and was not one to shy away from causes he believed in and was instrumental in collecting the three minibus loads of humanitarian equipment for civilians that the learners gathered when the war in Ukraine initially kicked off.\u201d The post added that Tindal-Draper worked for the NHS after finishing the course. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe are aware that a British national has reportedly died in Ukraine and stand ready to assist the family in the UK.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The government is likely to offer a financial lifeline to the hospice sector amid fears end-of-life care providers are at risk of closure due to the double blow of the employers\u2019 national insurance rise and higher wage bills, the Guardian understands.</p> <p>Officials have been looking at the options for providing more funding to hospices and other end-of-life care through the NHS partly to offset the impact of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/31/ed-davey-care-sector-employers-national-insurance\">the national insurance rise</a>, which the sector believes could cost it \u00a330m a year.</p> <p>Hospices were already struggling with higher wage bills to match the 5.5% pay rise given to public medical workers, with the sector overall estimating an additional shortfall of about \u00a360m.</p> <p>Whitehall sources said nothing was a done deal but it is understood three main options had been considered: offsetting all or part of the national insurance rise for non-NHS providers of end-of-life care; funding for staff pay rises that match NHS terms and conditions every year; or a direct funding pot for hospices rather than end-of-life care more broadly.</p> <p>Pressed last week on the plight of hospices, Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, suggested it was a \u201cmatter for the NHS to make the allocation of money to, for example, hospices as well as GP surgeries\u201d. Integrated care boards within the NHS have been given a duty to commission palliative and end-of-life care since 2022, but the sector says the extent to which this happens is patchy \u2013 and two-thirds of funding still comes from the voluntary sector.</p> <p>MPs say West Streeting, the health secretary, has privately told them he will deal with the funding crisis facing the end-of-life care sector. A message was passed around a Labour MPs\u2019 WhatsApp group last week suggesting he was working on a solution.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/06/assisted-dying-bill-to-be-published-amid-mps-concern-over-scrutiny-legislation\">debate on assisted dying</a>, which is due to take place in parliament in late November, is likely to provide an opportunity to reassess funding for hospices more fundamentally.

      "bodyText": "The government is likely to offer a financial lifeline to the hospice sector amid fears end-of-life care providers are at risk of closure due to the double blow of the employers\u2019 national insurance rise and higher wage bills, the Guardian understands. Officials have been looking at the options for providing more funding to hospices and other end-of-life care through the NHS partly to offset the impact of the national insurance rise, which the sector believes could cost it \u00a330m a year. Hospices were already struggling with higher wage bills to match the 5.5% pay rise given to public medical workers, with the sector overall estimating an additional shortfall of about \u00a360m. Whitehall sources said nothing was a done deal but it is understood three main options had been considered: offsetting all or part of the national insurance rise for non-NHS providers of end-of-life care; funding for staff pay rises that match NHS terms and conditions every year; or a direct funding pot for hospices rather than end-of-life care more broadly. Pressed last week on the plight of hospices, Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, suggested it was a \u201cmatter for the NHS to make the allocation of money to, for example, hospices as well as GP surgeries\u201d. Integrated care boards within the NHS have been given a duty to commission palliative and end-of-life care since 2022, but the sector says the extent to which this happens is patchy \u2013 and two-thirds of funding still comes from the voluntary sector. MPs say West Streeting, the health secretary, has privately told them he will deal with the funding crisis facing the end-of-life care sector. A message was passed around a Labour MPs\u2019 WhatsApp group last week suggesting he was working on a solution. The debate on assisted dying, which is due to take place in parliament in late November, is likely to provide an opportunity to reassess funding for hospices more fundamentally. The legislation will look at whether to allow assisted dying for terminally ill patients in the last six months of their lives. Many cabinet ministers supported the idea in the past but Streeting is believed to have changed his mind and is not likely to vote for the legislation as he is worried the palliative care system is not \u201cwhere it needs to be to give people a real choice\u201d. The Labour MP Rachael Maskell, an opponent of assisted dying, said improvements to the end-of-life care sector were needed so that people would have better access to medicine and options for good care when facing terminal diagnoses. \u201cThe hospice sector is massively underresourced \u2026 but there is so much that palliative medicine can provide. In the assisted dying debate, we are hearing a lot of tragic stories about suboptimal deaths and yet had high-quality provision been made it could have been so much better.\u201d The end-of-life and hospice sector is remaining neutral on the debate around assisted dying. However, it has repeatedly warned that more funding would be needed to avoid cuts to end-of-life services after the budget. The Marie Curie charity has written to Streeting saying the recently announced increase to employer national insurance contributions would cost the charity an additional \u00a33m a year, warning that without further support the only option would be to reduce services. Ruth Driscoll, the charity\u2019s associate director of policy, said: \u201cIt\u2019s really crucial that there is immediate funding to address [the national insurance] issue but these costs are going to be recurring so one-off funding is not going to be enough. The challenges facing palliative care are really significant. The new NHS long-term plan and the comprehensive spending review in the spring should set out a really clear approach for transforming these services in the future.\u201d Toby Porter, the chief executive of Hospice UK, which represents more than 200 hospices, said: \u201cFar too many hospices are already cutting services, due to several years of NHS funding failing to keep up with rapidly rising costs of delivering care. \u201cThe increases in employer national insurance from April will cost the average hospice several hundred thousands of pounds, and has made the situation much more serious and much more urgent. Hospice charities will be setting their budgets for the next financial year in the next month or two.\u201d Meanwhile, the Labour MP who tabled the proposed legislation on assisted dying has said laws will feature the \u201cstrictest protections\u201d against coercion anywhere in the world with the bill potentially running to more than 40 pages. Kim Leadbeater has warned the existing policy leads to people with a settled wish to die having to travel abroad to end their lives. Writing in the House magazine, Leadbeater said her proposal \u201coffers hope to those terminally ill people with a clear, informed and settled wish to have a better death, while at the same time protecting all those approaching the end of their life from coercion or pressure to make a decision that isn\u2019t right for them; indeed my bill will contain the strictest protections and safeguards of any legislation anywhere in the world\u201d. A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe want everyone to have access to high-quality end-of-life care and are aware of the financial pressures facing the hospice sector, and of the huge generosity of the British public, whose donations provide a significant proportion of hospice funding. \u201cWe are determined to shift more healthcare into the community and ensure patients and their families receive high-quality, personalised care in the most appropriate setting, and hospices will have a big role to play in that shift.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Donald Trump owes his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/donald-trump-wins-us-presidential-election\">decisive 2024 presidential victory</a> in no small part to the enthusiastic support of the world\u2019s richest man. In the months leading up to the election, Elon Musk put his full weight behind the Maga movement, advocated for Trump on major podcasts and used his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/04/elon-musk-x-network-donald-trump\">influence over X to shape political discourse</a>. Musk\u2019s America Pac <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/25/elon-musk-donald-trump-donation/\">injected nearly $120m</a> into the former president\u2019s campaign.</p> <p>Now, Trump is looking to return the favor. Speaking with reporters last month, he said he would appoint Musk as \u201c<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/10/14/us-news/trump-ill-appoint-elon-musk-the-secretary-of-cost-cutting/\">secretary of cost-cutting</a>\u201d. Musk, for his part, has joked he would be interested in serving as head of the \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d (Doge) with a stated goal of reducing government spending by $2tn. Practically speaking, experts say those cost cuts could result in deregulation and policy changes that would directly impact Musk\u2019s universe of companies, particularly Tesla, SpaceX, X and Neuralink.</p> <p>Trump administration officials, eager to maintain Musk\u2019s support, may similarly loosen rules and reassign federal government officials to benefit Musk\u2019s interests. It\u2019s an explicit, openly transactional relationship unlike any seen in recent US political memory, experts said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen lobbying efforts, we\u2019ve seen Super Pacs, but this is a different level we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d said Gita Johar, a professor at Columbia Business School. \u201cThere will be some quid pro quo where he [Musk] will benefit.\u201d</p> <p>Pausing for a moment, Johar added: \u201c\u2018Conflict of interest\u2019 seems rather quaint.\u201d</p> <h2>Trump: bad for electric vehicles, good for Elon</h2> <p>Tesla is already reaping the benefits of a second Trump administration. On Wednesday, just hours after the Associated Press official called the race in favor of Trump, the car company\u2019s <a href=\"https://autos.yahoo.com/tesla-surges-13-market-sees-002917585.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABdXnOTnXgvqV4ZpIoOMayDxyYm-iZ6r62fAJu7VB4E2pOHNZXuDJ0zmTL3085LE3d53HVjwro_AIPayLnwkPxq3sApf9dFuqV64Zz8GUKniSCs-D04jmFYcj2fe18kmNvfFTMnhDNaynn6Bm4ZKwXhy89_AhMhTxDrnFyAjvxEI\">stock shot up 13%</a> to a 52-week high. By the end of the week, Tesla reached $1tn in market capitalization, its highest valuation in two years. Musk\u2019s own fortune shot up $26bn with the stock.</p> <p>That might seem odd considering the former president\u2019s vocal disdain for electric vehicles. In recent years, the president-elect has referred to efforts to promote environmentally friendly cars as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-07-19/trump-pledges-to-end-the-green-new-scam-video\">Green New Scam</a>\u201d and claimed EVs simply \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d. He has also pledged he would end Joe Biden\u2019s \u201celectric vehicle mandate\u201d on his first day in office. Biden has implemented tax credits and emissions standards that favor electric vehicles.</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s hardline rhetoric against EVs started to soften almost immediately after Musk pledged his support for the candidate. Trump himself has been explicit about the reason for his shifting outlook.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m for electric cars,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-electric-vehicles-elon-musk-endorsement-2024-8\">said during a campaign event in August</a>. \u201cI have to be, because Elon endorsed me very strongly.\u201d</p> <p>Still, experts agreed a Trump administration will probably roll back tax credits for consumers looking to buy new electric vehicles. That would hurt newer EV startups and legacy carmakers that are still trying to bring down the costs of manufacturing their vehicles. By contrast, eliminating those credits may be a boon to Tesla since the company has already made extensive use of those credits to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/09/business/tesla-electric-vehicles-market-share.html\">capture a commanding lead in the EV</a> market in the US.</p>    <p>\u201cTesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched,\u201d the Wedbush analyst Dan Ives <a href=\"https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-1-trillion-market-cap-for-first-time-since-2022/\">said in a recent note to investors</a>. \u201cThis dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment.\u201d For the rest of the electric vehicle industry, though, Trump presidency would be \u201can overall negative\u201d, Ives wrote.</p> <p>Tesla will also find itself caught in the middle of Trump\u2019s much-vaunted but still vague tariff proposals. Though auto tariffs could help insulate Tesla from cheap, competitive Chinese electric vehicles entering US markets from the likes of BYD, stiff import taxes would simultaneously make it much more expensive to manufacture new cars. Tesla\u2019s supply chain is <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Tesla-relies-on-China-for-40-of-battery-supply-chain-analysis\">highly dependent on goods and materials from China</a>. Steel tariffs would probably drive up the cost to produce the company\u2019s Cybertruck, while tariffs impacting rare earth metals and minerals sourced from China would also drive up costs of semiconductors crucial to powering the fleet\u2019s cameras and sensors.</p> <p>\u201cIf there is a general tariff, the price of those will skyrocket,\u201d the George Mason University Mercatus Center research fellow Matt Mittelsteadt said in an interview. \u201cYou can\u2019t re-shore what you can\u2019t make.\u201d Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <h2>Clearing a road for Musk\u2019s autonomous vehicles</h2> <p>Experts say Musk\u2019s role in the Trump administration could help chart the path for Tesla\u2019s autonomous vehicle rollout. The company is being <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/18/tesla-faces-nhtsa-investigation-of-full-self-driving-after-fatal-collision.html\">investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA) over the role its Autopilot and \u201cfull-self driving\u201d features may have played in a spate of accidents, including more than two dozen fatal ones. A Trump administration favorable toward Musk\u2019s business interest could wind down those investigations.</p> <p>\u201cThe specific worry with Musk and NHTSA is that the Trump administration might influence the decisions that civil servants are making to benefit the business interests of Tesla,\u201d the Cardozo School of Law professor and tech regulation expert Matthew Wansley said.</p> <p>Musk has also explicitly said he would try to leverage his influence in a Trump administration to streamline regulations around fully autonomous \u201cdriverless\u201d vehicles like those operated by Waymo and Cruise. Though Tesla vehicles aren\u2019t currently capable of the same level of autonomy, Musk recently revealed the concept for a more advanced \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/11/elon-musk-unveils-tesla-cybercab-self-driving-robotaxi\">Cybercab</a>\u201d robotaxi he says will operate without a steering wheel.</p> <p>Current safety regulation for this level of autonomous vehicles varies by state and generally require years of testing with humans behind the wheel. Musk advocated for a \u201cfederal approval process\u201d that would preempt those strict state rules <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-touts-influence-under-135354396.html\">during a third-quarter Tesla earnings call</a>. If that weaker federal process were to be approved, Tesla may have a shorter climb to catch up with more advanced competitors.</p> <h2>SpaceX could win lucrative government contracts for a Starlink rollout and a Mars mission</h2> <p>Few of Musk\u2019s endeavors have benefited as directly from government partnerships in recent years as SpaceX. The private space company secured a $3bn federal contract <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/space/space-nasa-moon-lander-starship-b1833111.html\">in 2021</a>. It is currently competing with Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin for a<a href=\"https://spacenews.com/blue-origin-spacex-ula-win-5-6-billion-in-pentagon-launch-contracts/\"> series of contracts with the US Space Force</a> worth some $5.6bn. Musk has already asked Trump to appoint SpaceX employees to top government positions, according to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-benefits.html\">New York Times</a>.</p> <p>Experts agreed Musk\u2019s relationship with Trump would strengthen its position as a top contender for space contracts. Mittelsteadt said recent Republican opposition to the Biden administration\u2019s beleaguered rural <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/18/senate-republicans-ding-harris-role-as-broadband-czar-00179855\">$42.45bn broadband initiative</a> could also open up a new path for SpaceX\u2019s Starlink satellite internet service. A GOP-led Federal Communications Commission, Mittelsteadt argued, could decide to pay SpaceX to expand Starlink access nationwide. Trump lauded Starlink\u2019s role in providing internet access to hurricane survivors<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/11/06/elon-musk-big-win-trump-election/76093895007/\"> during a speech</a> on election night.</p> <p>\u201cThe ceiling for what he could possibly get out of government contracts could be raising,\u201d Mittelsteadt said.</p> <p>Trump and Musk also appear united in their interest in sending a rocket to Mars. The president-elect has repeatedly praised Musk\u2019s \u201cbeautiful, shiny white\u201d rockets on the campaign trail and has said he wants to land a rocket on the red planet before the end of his next term.</p> <p>\u201cWe will land an American astronaut on Mars,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-11-06/musk-says-spacex-mars-plan-under-threat-from-regulators?srnd=homepage-canada\">said during an October rally</a>.</p> <p>Musk, meanwhile, has repeatedly emphasized his dream of colonizing Mars and creating an interplanetary human species. Equally as often, he has criticized the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for bureaucratic \u201csuperfluous delays\u201d. A favorable Trump administration could feel motivated to soften those rules and guidelines, experts said. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <h2>Trump could reduce scrutiny on Neuralink and X</h2> <p>Telsa and SpaceX aren\u2019t the only Musk-owned properties that stand to thrive during a second Trump term. Neuralink, Musk\u2019s brain-computer interface company, has<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/29/musks-neuralink-brain-implant-company-cited-by-fda-over-animal-lab-issues.html#:~:text=U.S.%20Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration,agency%20report%20reviewed%20by%20Reuters.\"> drawn scrutiny from the US Food and Drug Administration</a> over alleged issues related to record-keeping and quality controls for its animal testing. A more favorable FDA under the Trump administration could help wind down those inquiries and provide a clearer runway for the company\u2019s future experiments. Neuralink did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>X, which Musk acquired in 2020 for $44bn, could likewise benefit during a Trump term. The platform served as an important, invaluable resource for spreading pro-Trump rhetoric during the 2024 presidential campaign. Johar, whose recent research dives into X\u2019s rise, said its utility to Trump makes it unlikely to draw regulators\u2019 ire under him.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see any guardrails going up in terms of verifying the truth of information that\u2019s already gone by the wayside since X was taken over,\u201d said Johar.</p> <h2>\u2018Conflict of interest seem rather quaint\u2019</h2> <p>The scope of Musk\u2019s influence in the Trump administration and US politics more broadly is just beginning. The billionaire said last week in a conversation livestreamed on X that he would <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/post/188045/elon-musk-2024-election-meddling-pac-plans\">continue pouring money into America Pac</a>, his organization founded this summer to support Trump\u2019s bid for president, and has plans to \u201cweigh in heavily\u201d on future elections like the 2026 midterms.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to imagine how much influence Elon Musk could have in this administration because there\u2019s no precedent,\u201d the University of California Berkeley professor Dan Schnur said. \u201cHe could have spent over $1bn, and it would\u2019ve still been an incredibly savvy investment for him.\u201d</p> <p>Experts speaking to the Guardian unanimously agreed Musk\u2019s potential efforts to influence policies that could directly impact his business would constitute a clear conflict of interest. Whether or not the billionaire faces substantive penalties, however, remains to be seen. Musk and the allied Trump administration could face a barrage of lawsuits alleging misconduct, but litigation alone may not prevent Musk from achieving his preferred policy agenda, experts predicted.</p> <p>\u201cThere are all sorts of potential conflicts of interest. The question is whether that bothers Trump or not,\u201d Schnur said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reasonable bet to assume that it does not.\u201d</p> <p>Musk has said he would attempt to trim $2tn in government spending if appointed to the cost-cutting position in the Trump White House. Though he hasn\u2019t fully outlined how he would achieve such a goal, the billionaire has suggested much of that belt-tightening could come from eliminating what he sees as redundant government workers and reducing overly burdensome regulations. But Mittelstead says Musk will probably face an uphill battle if tries to apply a \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d attitude toward US government positions.</p> <p>\u201cThe type of cost-cutting, slash-and-burn approach that he brought to Twitter is not possible in the public sector,\u201d Mittelstead said.</p> <p>It\u2019s also an open question as to whether or not Musk and Trump\u2019s newfound relationship can withstand the weight of two notoriously volatile personalities. Musk made headlines in 2017 when he <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/1/15726292/elon-musk-trump-advisory-council-paris-climate-decision\">stepped down from a pair of Trump advisory councils </a>after disagreeing with the then president\u2019s decision to exit the Paris climate accords. Trump, for his part, has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/12/politics/trump-elon-musk-comments-age-presidency/index.html\">previously referred to Musk</a> as a \u201cbullshit artist\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve appeared to have developed a very strong personal rapport,\u201d Schnur said. \u201cBut they\u2019re also two of the most volatile personalities on the set and earth.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump owes his decisive 2024 presidential victory in no small part to the enthusiastic support of the world\u2019s richest man. In the months leading up to the election, Elon Musk put his full weight behind the Maga movement, advocated for Trump on major podcasts and used his influence over X to shape political discourse. Musk\u2019s America Pac injected nearly $120m into the former president\u2019s campaign. Now, Trump is looking to return the favor. Speaking with reporters last month, he said he would appoint Musk as \u201csecretary of cost-cutting\u201d. Musk, for his part, has joked he would be interested in serving as head of the \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d (Doge) with a stated goal of reducing government spending by $2tn. Practically speaking, experts say those cost cuts could result in deregulation and policy changes that would directly impact Musk\u2019s universe of companies, particularly Tesla, SpaceX, X and Neuralink. Trump administration officials, eager to maintain Musk\u2019s support, may similarly loosen rules and reassign federal government officials to benefit Musk\u2019s interests. It\u2019s an explicit, openly transactional relationship unlike any seen in recent US political memory, experts said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen lobbying efforts, we\u2019ve seen Super Pacs, but this is a different level we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d said Gita Johar, a professor at Columbia Business School. \u201cThere will be some quid pro quo where he [Musk] will benefit.\u201d Pausing for a moment, Johar added: \u201c\u2018Conflict of interest\u2019 seems rather quaint.\u201d Trump: bad for electric vehicles, good for Elon Tesla is already reaping the benefits of a second Trump administration. On Wednesday, just hours after the Associated Press official called the race in favor of Trump, the car company\u2019s stock shot up 13% to a 52-week high. By the end of the week, Tesla reached $1tn in market capitalization, its highest valuation in two years. Musk\u2019s own fortune shot up $26bn with the stock. That might seem odd considering the former president\u2019s vocal disdain for electric vehicles. In recent years, the president-elect has referred to efforts to promote environmentally friendly cars as a \u201cGreen New Scam\u201d and claimed EVs simply \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d. He has also pledged he would end Joe Biden\u2019s \u201celectric vehicle mandate\u201d on his first day in office. Biden has implemented tax credits and emissions standards that favor electric vehicles. But Trump\u2019s hardline rhetoric against EVs started to soften almost immediately after Musk pledged his support for the candidate. Trump himself has been explicit about the reason for his shifting outlook. \u201cI\u2019m for electric cars,\u201d Trump said during a campaign event in August. \u201cI have to be, because Elon endorsed me very strongly.\u201d Still, experts agreed a Trump administration will probably roll back tax credits for consumers looking to buy new electric vehicles. That would hurt newer EV startups and legacy carmakers that are still trying to bring down the costs of manufacturing their vehicles. By contrast, eliminating those credits may be a boon to Tesla since the company has already made extensive use of those credits to capture a commanding lead in the EV market in the US. \u201cTesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched,\u201d the Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a recent note to investors. \u201cThis dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment.\u201d For the rest of the electric vehicle industry, though, Trump presidency would be \u201can overall negative\u201d, Ives wrote. Tesla will also find itself caught in the middle of Trump\u2019s much-vaunted but still vague tariff proposals. Though auto tariffs could help insulate Tesla from cheap, competitive Chinese electric vehicles entering US markets from the likes of BYD, stiff import taxes would simultaneously make it much more expensive to manufacture new cars. Tesla\u2019s supply chain is highly dependent on goods and materials from China. Steel tariffs would probably drive up the cost to produce the company\u2019s Cybertruck, while tariffs impacting rare earth metals and minerals sourced from China would also drive up costs of semiconductors crucial to powering the fleet\u2019s cameras and sensors. \u201cIf there is a general tariff, the price of those will skyrocket,\u201d the George Mason University Mercatus Center research fellow Matt Mittelsteadt said in an interview. \u201cYou can\u2019t re-shore what you can\u2019t make.\u201d Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Clearing a road for Musk\u2019s autonomous vehicles Experts say Musk\u2019s role in the Trump administration could help chart the path for Tesla\u2019s autonomous vehicle rollout. The company is being investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) over the role its Autopilot and \u201cfull-self driving\u201d features may have played in a spate of accidents, including more than two dozen fatal ones. A Trump administration favorable toward Musk\u2019s business interest could wind down those investigations. \u201cThe specific worry with Musk and NHTSA is that the Trump administration might influence the decisions that civil servants are making to benefit the business interests of Tesla,\u201d the Cardozo School of Law professor and tech regulation expert Matthew Wansley said. Musk has also explicitly said he would try to leverage his influence in a Trump administration to streamline regulations around fully autonomous \u201cdriverless\u201d vehicles like those operated by Waymo and Cruise. Though Tesla vehicles aren\u2019t currently capable of the same level of autonomy, Musk recently revealed the concept for a more advanced \u201cCybercab\u201d robotaxi he says will operate without a steering wheel. Current safety regulation for this level of autonomous vehicles varies by state and generally require years of testing with humans behind the wheel. Musk advocated for a \u201cfederal approval process\u201d that would preempt those strict state rules during a third-quarter Tesla earnings call. If that weaker federal process were to be approved, Tesla may have a shorter climb to catch up with more advanced competitors. SpaceX could win lucrative government contracts for a Starlink rollout and a Mars mission Few of Musk\u2019s endeavors have benefited as directly from government partnerships in recent years as SpaceX. The private space company secured a $3bn federal contract in 2021. It is currently competing with Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin for a series of contracts with the US Space Force worth some $5.6bn. Musk has already asked Trump to appoint SpaceX employees to top government positions, according to the New York Times. Experts agreed Musk\u2019s relationship with Trump would strengthen its position as a top contender for space contracts. Mittelsteadt said recent Republican opposition to the Biden administration\u2019s beleaguered rural $42.45bn broadband initiative could also open up a new path for SpaceX\u2019s Starlink satellite internet service. A GOP-led Federal Communications Commission, Mittelsteadt argued, could decide to pay SpaceX to expand Starlink access nationwide. Trump lauded Starlink\u2019s role in providing internet access to hurricane survivors during a speech on election night. \u201cThe ceiling for what he could possibly get out of government contracts could be raising,\u201d Mittelsteadt said. Trump and Musk also appear united in their interest in sending a rocket to Mars. The president-elect has repeatedly praised Musk\u2019s \u201cbeautiful, shiny white\u201d rockets on the campaign trail and has said he wants to land a rocket on the red planet before the end of his next term. \u201cWe will land an American astronaut on Mars,\u201d Trump said during an October rally. Musk, meanwhile, has repeatedly emphasized his dream of colonizing Mars and creating an interplanetary human species. Equally as often, he has criticized the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for bureaucratic \u201csuperfluous delays\u201d. A favorable Trump administration could feel motivated to soften those rules and guidelines, experts said. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment. Trump could reduce scrutiny on Neuralink and X Telsa and SpaceX aren\u2019t the only Musk-owned properties that stand to thrive during a second Trump term. Neuralink, Musk\u2019s brain-computer interface company, has drawn scrutiny from the US Food and Drug Administration over alleged issues related to record-keeping and quality controls for its animal testing. A more favorable FDA under the Trump administration could help wind down those inquiries and provide a clearer runway for the company\u2019s future experiments. Neuralink did not respond to a request for comment. X, which Musk acquired in 2020 for $44bn, could likewise benefit during a Trump term. The platform served as an important, invaluable resource for spreading pro-Trump rhetoric during the 2024 presidential campaign. Johar, whose recent research dives into X\u2019s rise, said its utility to Trump makes it unlikely to draw regulators\u2019 ire under him. \u201cI don\u2019t see any guardrails going up in terms of verifying the truth of information that\u2019s already gone by the wayside since X was taken over,\u201d said Johar. \u2018Conflict of interest seem rather quaint\u2019 The scope of Musk\u2019s influence in the Trump administration and US politics more broadly is just beginning. The billionaire said last week in a conversation livestreamed on X that he would continue pouring money into America Pac, his organization founded this summer to support Trump\u2019s bid for president, and has plans to \u201cweigh in heavily\u201d on future elections like the 2026 midterms. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to imagine how much influence Elon Musk could have in this administration because there\u2019s no precedent,\u201d the University of California Berkeley professor Dan Schnur said. \u201cHe could have spent over $1bn, and it would\u2019ve still been an incredibly savvy investment for him.\u201d Experts speaking to the Guardian unanimously agreed Musk\u2019s potential efforts to influence policies that could directly impact his business would constitute a clear conflict of interest. Whether or not the billionaire faces substantive penalties, however, remains to be seen. Musk and the allied Trump administration could face a barrage of lawsuits alleging misconduct, but litigation alone may not prevent Musk from achieving his preferred policy agenda, experts predicted. \u201cThere are all sorts of potential conflicts of interest. The question is whether that bothers Trump or not,\u201d Schnur said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reasonable bet to assume that it does not.\u201d Musk has said he would attempt to trim $2tn in government spending if appointed to the cost-cutting position in the Trump White House. Though he hasn\u2019t fully outlined how he would achieve such a goal, the billionaire has suggested much of that belt-tightening could come from eliminating what he sees as redundant government workers and reducing overly burdensome regulations. But Mittelstead says Musk will probably face an uphill battle if tries to apply a \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d attitude toward US government positions. \u201cThe type of cost-cutting, slash-and-burn approach that he brought to Twitter is not possible in the public sector,\u201d Mittelstead said. It\u2019s also an open question as to whether or not Musk and Trump\u2019s newfound relationship can withstand the weight of two notoriously volatile personalities. Musk made headlines in 2017 when he stepped down from a pair of Trump advisory councils after disagreeing with the then president\u2019s decision to exit the Paris climate accords. Trump, for his part, has previously referred to Musk as a \u201cbullshit artist\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019ve appeared to have developed a very strong personal rapport,\u201d Schnur said. \u201cBut they\u2019re also two of the most volatile personalities on the set and earth.\u201d",

With only poor communications to northern Gaza and no international reporters allowed into the territory, exact details of casualties are difficult to verify. Witnesses report intense fighting between troops and militants.</p> <p>The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Sunday that at least 43,603 people had been killed in the Israeli offensive launched 13 months ago. More than half of identified casualties are women and children. Thousands more are believed to be buried under the rubble.</p> <p>The toll includes 51 deaths in the previous 24 hours, according to the ministry, which also said 102,929 people had been wounded in the Gaza Strip since the war began when Hamas militants attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200, mostly civilians, and abducting 250.</p> <p>Ramy Abdu, the chair of the Geneva-based Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, which tracks casualties of the Gaza war, said last month that his team of more than 40 researchers in Gaza had identified 365 families that had lost 10 or more members from the beginning of the war until August, and 2,750 who had lost at least three.</p>    <p>Early on Sunday the Israeli military claimed in a <a href=\"https://x.com/idfonline/status/1855477019644998104\">post on X</a> it had \u201celiminated dozens of terrorists and destroyed terrorist infrastructures and a warehouse of weapons\u201d in Jabaliya. Israel says it has issued evacuation orders telling civilians to leave Jabaliya for their own safety and accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields to protect its fighters and weapons, a charge the militant Islamist group denies.</p> <p>Aid agencies, medics and witnesses say those trapped by the fighting in Jabaliya and the north of Gaza are suffering appalling conditions, with very limited water, food stocks running out, debris everywhere and continuing bombardment and combat.</p> <p>Food experts this week said northern Gaza <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/09/strong-likelihood-of-imminent-famine-in-northern-gaza-food-experts-warn-as-israel-continues-siege\">faced imminent famine</a>. In a rare alert, the independent Famine Review Committee said: \u201cIf no effective action is taken by stakeholders with influence, the scale of this looming catastrophe is likely to dwarf anything we have seen so far in the Gaza Strip since 7 October 2023.\u201d</p> <p>The growing desperation comes as the deadline approaches next week of a 30-day ultimatum the Biden administration gave Israel to raise the level of humanitarian assistance allowed into Gaza or risk restrictions on US military assistance.</p> <p>The US state department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, said Israel had made some progress by announcing the opening of a new crossing into central Gaza and approving new delivery routes.<br><br>But he said Israel must do more. \u201cIt\u2019s not just sufficient to open new roads if more humanitarian assistance isn\u2019t going through those roads.\u201d</p> <p>The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he had spoken three times with Donald Trump since Tuesday\u2019s US election and that they \u201csee eye-to-eye regarding the Iranian threat and all of its components\u201d.</p> <p>Iran has launched two massive barrages of missiles and other aerial weapons at Israel this year, and Israel has responded. Hamas and Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based Islamist movement, have historic ties with Tehran.</p> <p>In Lebanon, Israel\u2019s air campaign against Hezbollah continued on Sunday with reports of a strike on a house in the main eastern city of Baalbek.</p> <p>The Lebanese state-run National News Agency said: \u201cEnemy aircraft launched a strike on a house in the al-Laqees neighbourhood.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier, NNA reported a rare Israeli strike north of Beirut, on the Shia-majority village of Almat, which is located in a mostly Christian region.</p> <p>Israel launched an intense air offensive mainly targeting Hezbollah bastions in Lebanon\u2019s east and south and in southern Beirut on 23 September and a week later sent in ground troops.</p> <p>The escalation followed nearly a year of low-intensity, cross-border attacks by Hezbollah in support of Hamas after the 7 October attack. Israeli military officials said at least 25 rockets were fired by Hezbollah on Sunday. At least two drones were also intercepted.</p> <p>Underlining the regional extent of Israel\u2019s attack on Hezbollah, an Israeli airstrike on Sunday hit a residential building in the Damascus suburb of Sayeda Zeinab. The Syrian defence ministry said seven civilians were killed, reported the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based opposition war monitor, suggested Hezbollah was targeted.

      "bodyText": "Israeli warplanes carried out more strikes in northern Gaza on Sunday, reportedly destroying a home in the Jabaliya area that had been under siege for weeks, killing and wounding dozens, including many women and children. The death toll is one of the biggest in a single strike so far in Jabaliya, where hundreds of people have died since a major Israeli operation in the area began last month. Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency said 25 people had died in the pre-dawn attack on Sunday, including 13 children, while another 30 people were reported to have been wounded. Dr Fadel Naim, the director of the al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City, which received bodies after the strike, said the death toll was 17, including nine women, but the total was likely to rise as rescue efforts continued. The official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, and Hamas media put the number of people killed at 32. There was no immediate confirmation of the tally by the territory\u2019s health ministry. Israel\u2019s military said it hit \u201cinfrastructure\u201d in which militants were operating and \u201cposed a threat\u201d to troops in the area. \u201cPrior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians,\u201d a military spokesperson said. Anas al-Sharif, a reporter for the Qatar-based Al Jazeera network, said the home destroyed in the raid belonged to the Aloush family, adding that no civil defence agencies or ambulances had been able to reach the area due to the Israeli siege and that local people were still searching for more victims. UN officials said the last civil defence post in Jabaliya was destroyed in a strike more than a week ago, leaving the area without any effective rescue service. The Israeli military launched its offensive on Jabaliya and the nearby towns of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun early last month which it said was aimed at preventing Hamas from regrouping but which Palestinians and human rights groups say is aimed at depopulating northern Gaza. Dozens have died in a series of airstrikes on Jabaliya and neighbouring areas in recent days. With only poor communications to northern Gaza and no international reporters allowed into the territory, exact details of casualties are difficult to verify. Witnesses report intense fighting between troops and militants. The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Sunday that at least 43,603 people had been killed in the Israeli offensive launched 13 months ago. More than half of identified casualties are women and children. Thousands more are believed to be buried under the rubble. The toll includes 51 deaths in the previous 24 hours, according to the ministry, which also said 102,929 people had been wounded in the Gaza Strip since the war began when Hamas militants attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200, mostly civilians, and abducting 250. Ramy Abdu, the chair of the Geneva-based Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, which tracks casualties of the Gaza war, said last month that his team of more than 40 researchers in Gaza had identified 365 families that had lost 10 or more members from the beginning of the war until August, and 2,750 who had lost at least three. Early on Sunday the Israeli military claimed in a post on X it had \u201celiminated dozens of terrorists and destroyed terrorist infrastructures and a warehouse of weapons\u201d in Jabaliya. Israel says it has issued evacuation orders telling civilians to leave Jabaliya for their own safety and accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields to protect its fighters and weapons, a charge the militant Islamist group denies. Aid agencies, medics and witnesses say those trapped by the fighting in Jabaliya and the north of Gaza are suffering appalling conditions, with very limited water, food stocks running out, debris everywhere and continuing bombardment and combat. Food experts this week said northern Gaza faced imminent famine. In a rare alert, the independent Famine Review Committee said: \u201cIf no effective action is taken by stakeholders with influence, the scale of this looming catastrophe is likely to dwarf anything we have seen so far in the Gaza Strip since 7 October 2023.\u201d The growing desperation comes as the deadline approaches next week of a 30-day ultimatum the Biden administration gave Israel to raise the level of humanitarian assistance allowed into Gaza or risk restrictions on US military assistance. The US state department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, said Israel had made some progress by announcing the opening of a new crossing into central Gaza and approving new delivery routes. But he said Israel must do more. \u201cIt\u2019s not just sufficient to open new roads if more humanitarian assistance isn\u2019t going through those roads.\u201d The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he had spoken three times with Donald Trump since Tuesday\u2019s US election and that they \u201csee eye-to-eye regarding the Iranian threat and all of its components\u201d. Iran has launched two massive barrages of missiles and other aerial weapons at Israel this year, and Israel has responded. Hamas and Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based Islamist movement, have historic ties with Tehran. In Lebanon, Israel\u2019s air campaign against Hezbollah continued on Sunday with reports of a strike on a house in the main eastern city of Baalbek. The Lebanese state-run National News Agency said: \u201cEnemy aircraft launched a strike on a house in the al-Laqees neighbourhood.\u201d Earlier, NNA reported a rare Israeli strike north of Beirut, on the Shia-majority village of Almat, which is located in a mostly Christian region. Israel launched an intense air offensive mainly targeting Hezbollah bastions in Lebanon\u2019s east and south and in southern Beirut on 23 September and a week later sent in ground troops. The escalation followed nearly a year of low-intensity, cross-border attacks by Hezbollah in support of Hamas after the 7 October attack. Israeli military officials said at least 25 rockets were fired by Hezbollah on Sunday. At least two drones were also intercepted. Underlining the regional extent of Israel\u2019s attack on Hezbollah, an Israeli airstrike on Sunday hit a residential building in the Damascus suburb of Sayeda Zeinab. The Syrian defence ministry said seven civilians were killed, reported the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based opposition war monitor, suggested Hezbollah was targeted. Israel did not immediately comment. Additional reporting by Helen Livingstone.

Ukraine is now his business and if negotiations lead to a disaster it will be his, like Joe Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw from Afghanistan. This is a person who loves to win.\u201d</p> <p>Trump spoke to Vladimir Putin on the phone on Thursday and discussed the war in Ukraine, the Washington Post has reported. The US president-elect advised Putin not to escalate the war in Ukraine and reminded him of \u201cWashington\u2019s sizeable military presence in Europe\u201d, according to the Post.</p> <p>Ukrainians emphasise the complexity of negotiating with the Russian president, who they hope may overplay his hand with maximalist demands or irritate the notoriously prickly American leader.</p> <p>\u201cAt some point, Trump has to present a plan to Putin and we will see if Putin wants to stick to it. From that moment there is a new reality,\u201d Goncharenko said. \u201cIn the meantime, we have to work with the US and with US public opinion.\u201d</p> <p>Putin has already praised Trump\u2019s courage for his defiant behaviour after surviving an assassination attempt in July, describing him as \u201ca real man\u201d, though Moscow has said its goals in invading Ukraine \u2013 once described as \u201cdemilitarisation and denazification\u201d \u2013 remain unchanged.</p> <p>The Russian president congratulated Trump on his victory and said: \u201cHe turned out to be a courageous person. People show who they are in extraordinary circumstances. This is where a person reveals himself. And he showed himself, in my opinion, in a very correct manner, courageously. Like a man.\u201d</p> <p>He said he was ready for dialogue with Trump. \u201cWhat was said about the desire to restore relations with Russia, to bring about the end of the Ukrainian crisis, in my opinion this deserves attention at least.\u201d</p> <p>On Sunday, the Kremlin\u2019s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, was upbeat but non-specific. \u201cTrump during his election talked about how he perceives everything through deals, that he can make a deal that can lead to peace,\u201d he said, though he added campaign trail statements were not always borne out.</p> <p>A day after his phone call with Trump, Volodymyr<strong> </strong>Zelenskyy, Ukraine\u2019s president, acknowledged that the president-elect thought he could move fast. \u201cI believe that President Trump really wants a quick decision,\u201d he said at a meeting of the European Political Community in Budapest. \u201cHe wants that. It doesn\u2019t mean that it will happen this way.\u201d<br><br>Specific proposals for a peace deal in Ukraine from senior Republicans are competing and to some extent contradictory.

      "bodyText": "Ukrainian politicians are expressing tentative hopes that the return of Donald Trump to the White House will not necessarily lead to a rapid and humiliating forced peace. An initial 25-minute post-election call between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday, during which the president-elect handed the phone to Elon Musk, is said to have been positive in tone and no specifics of any peace proposals were discussed. Zelenskyy also thanked Musk for making the Starlink satellite internet service available for use by his country\u2019s military, for whom it is a vital communications tool on the front line. Though Trump promised to \u201cstop wars\u201d in his first speech after his victory over Kamala Harris became apparent last week, there are no settled outlines of a peace plan yet, giving Kyiv breathing space to press its own case. Oleksiy Goncharenko, a Ukrainian opposition MP, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think that Trump\u2019s victory is a catastrophe. Ukraine is now his business and if negotiations lead to a disaster it will be his, like Joe Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw from Afghanistan. This is a person who loves to win.\u201d Trump spoke to Vladimir Putin on the phone on Thursday and discussed the war in Ukraine, the Washington Post has reported. The US president-elect advised Putin not to escalate the war in Ukraine and reminded him of \u201cWashington\u2019s sizeable military presence in Europe\u201d, according to the Post. Ukrainians emphasise the complexity of negotiating with the Russian president, who they hope may overplay his hand with maximalist demands or irritate the notoriously prickly American leader. \u201cAt some point, Trump has to present a plan to Putin and we will see if Putin wants to stick to it. From that moment there is a new reality,\u201d Goncharenko said. \u201cIn the meantime, we have to work with the US and with US public opinion.\u201d Putin has already praised Trump\u2019s courage for his defiant behaviour after surviving an assassination attempt in July, describing him as \u201ca real man\u201d, though Moscow has said its goals in invading Ukraine \u2013 once described as \u201cdemilitarisation and denazification\u201d \u2013 remain unchanged. The Russian president congratulated Trump on his victory and said: \u201cHe turned out to be a courageous person. People show who they are in extraordinary circumstances. This is where a person reveals himself. And he showed himself, in my opinion, in a very correct manner, courageously. Like a man.\u201d He said he was ready for dialogue with Trump. \u201cWhat was said about the desire to restore relations with Russia, to bring about the end of the Ukrainian crisis, in my opinion this deserves attention at least.\u201d On Sunday, the Kremlin\u2019s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, was upbeat but non-specific. \u201cTrump during his election talked about how he perceives everything through deals, that he can make a deal that can lead to peace,\u201d he said, though he added campaign trail statements were not always borne out. A day after his phone call with Trump, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine\u2019s president, acknowledged that the president-elect thought he could move fast. \u201cI believe that President Trump really wants a quick decision,\u201d he said at a meeting of the European Political Community in Budapest. \u201cHe wants that. It doesn\u2019t mean that it will happen this way.\u201d Specific proposals for a peace deal in Ukraine from senior Republicans are competing and to some extent contradictory. A critical factor will be Trump\u2019s appointments to the state department and Pentagon as well as his choice of national security adviser. In June, the retired Lt Gen Keith Kellogg and Fred Fleitz, who previously both served as chiefs of staff in Trump\u2019s national security council, presented a proposal to Trump that would force Ukraine to negotiate by threatening to cut off military aid, freezing the conflict along the current frontlines. In September, JD Vance, now the vice-president-elect, proposed something similar, a plan that would allow Russia to take control of the 20% of Ukraine it currently occupies, and stipulating that Ukraine would never be allowed to join Nato. Another plan partly proposed by Mike Pompeo, a former secretary of state under Trump now considered to be a candidate for defence secretary, involves a de facto partition based on the current frontlines while lifting \u201call restrictions on the type of weapons Ukraine can obtain and use\u201d \u2013 including British Storm Shadow missiles. This would be paid for with money obtained from Russian foreign exchange reserves; $50bn in loans from G7 members was announced last month. Over the weekend, the Trump campaign distanced themselves from a comment made by another campaign adviser, Bryan Lanza, who said \u201cCrimea is gone,\u201d arguing the occupied territories were lost for good. Lanza \u201cdoes not speak for\u201d Trump, a spokesperson for the Republican said. All such proposals are diametrically opposed to Zelenskyy\u2019s own \u201cvictory plan\u201d presented publicly last month, which called for Nato membership plus unrestricted use of western weapons to force a restoration of its internationally recognised territory. Across Ukraine there is a certain fatalism. Maria Avdeeva, a Kyiv-based fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute thinktank, said: \u201cI think Ukrainians have already learned the lesson that we have to count on ourselves\u201d \u2013 a refrain that crops up repeatedly in conversation. Ukraine is already struggling on the battlefield to a degree not seen since the spring of 2022, particularly on the southern part of the eastern from, where Ukraine has lost 9km in a week in some areas as Russia presses forward aggressively, incurring, according to UK estimates, numbers of troops killed and wounded of as high as 1,354 a day. The numbers of cases of Ukrainian desertion (18,196) and soldiers going absent without leave (35,307) between January and September are double those of the whole of 2023, according to leaked figures from the prosecutor general\u2019s office, suggesting a growing weariness in parts of the armed forces. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine\u2019s most senior military commander, said on Saturday: \u201cThe situation remains challenging and shows signs of escalation.

Donald Trump floated the idea that George Bush might want him as his running mate in the looming US presidential election, an overture Bush described as \u201cstrange and unbelievable\u201d. This was the political backdrop when I joined the Guardian in 1988 \u2013 the year before Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web, when mobile phones were in their infancy and the climate crisis was just starting to become a hot political issue.

But in autumn, when there is more moisture in the air, it can instead mean a spell of low cloud, mist and drizzle. \u201cIt can trap a layer of moist air at the surface,\u201d said Vautrey. \u201cHigh pressure itself can be a blocking pattern. You can get it sat over one particular location for a long period of time.\u201d While bright sunny weather is often assumed to lift our mood, the scientific evidence for this is marginal, although one study suggests we are more likely to feel tired in cloudy conditions. There is a stronger case for spending time in natural daylight (even when overcast), which is essential for vitamin D production and helps regulate the body\u2019s circadian rhythms. On Sunday the mist and clouds are expected to be swept aside as a new weather front moves in from the north-west and moves south-eastwards. \u201cBehind that we\u2019re introducing some much fresher conditions,\u201d said Vautrey. \u201cIt will help clear out all the grot and the cloud that\u2019s around at the moment.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The writer Paul Bailey, who has died aged 87, believed in ignoring surfaces or trying to see past them \u2013 to identify what was special about the ordinary and overlooked, and what was recognisable and understandable in the unfamiliar. His first career was in acting, and he always aimed to escape narrow egoism. Like the hero of his wonderfully entertaining novel Peter Smart\u2019s Confessions (1977), Bailey \u201chated self-display\u201d and was a \u201ckeen observer of it in others\u201d.</p> <p>His lifelong suspicion of preciousness was reflected in the priorities and approach of his work as novelist, critic and broadcaster. Reviewing his weekly <a href=\"https://www.nicholasmonsour.com/blog/angela-carter-bbc-radio-3-interview-1991.html\">Radio 3 conversations with writers</a> (1988-92), the Daily Telegraph described him as a \u201cperfect interviewer\u201d.\u2019</p> <p>He kept faith with a certain kind of English modesty, and in time, received prizes named in memory of Somerset Maugham (1968), EM Forster (1974) and George Orwell (1978). Even when he went slightly \u201cexperimental\u201d, with the fragmented character studies Trespasses (1970) and A Distant Likeness (1973), he did so with notable restraint. </p> <p>As an actor, he imagined finding a niche playing \u201ccockney, and other, eccentrics\u201d. Instead, he filled his books with them. He described an earlier generation in his widely celebrated debut, At the Jerusalem (1967), which takes place in a care home, and the dual portrait Old Soldiers (1980). Peter Smart recalls a range of encounters, notably with the delusional doctor F Leonard Cottie. Bailey enjoyed what he called \u201cthe peculiar sharpness of London talk\u201d, and used comic dialogue to lay bare mid-century and postwar working-class life.</p>    <p>A sense of openness animated the six novels he produced during the first two decades of his career \u2013 a period in which he could do no wrong. During this time, he also wrote a sympathetic account of the Streatham brothel-keeper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/16/cynthia-payne\">Cynthia Payne</a>, An English Madam (1982), which became the 1987 film Personal Services, directed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jan/22/terry-jones-obituary\">Terry Jones</a> and starring Julie Walters.</p> <p>He used his exercises in autobiographical fiction as an opportunity to show how it should be done. The coda to Peter Smart\u2019s Confessions, the posthumously published memoir of a jobbing actor, offers a round-up of what happened to the \u201ccast\u201d, in which Peter appears fifth in a list of six.</p> <p>Gabriel\u2019s Lament (1986), the story of a writer\u2019s life, was similarly outward-looking, delivering a patient account \u2013 with third-person interludes \u2013 of the spur for the narrator\u2019s belated sense of \u201cgrief.\u201d Both books appeared on the Booker prize shortlist.</p> <p>He was born Peter Bailey, in Battersea, south-west London, which he recalled as \u201ca rather primly respectable area\u201d. \u201cPaul\u201d was a twin he imagined, and a name he first adopted as an actor. His family lived in the upstairs of a terrace house without running hot water. Bailey and his mother, Helen (nee Burgess), often bickered \u2013 for instance, over whether his father, Arthur, worked as a \u201cdustman\u201d or a \u201croadsweeper\u201d. (She instructed him to tell people he \u201cworked for the council\u201d.) \u201cIf you put her in a book,\u201d a character tells Peter Smart of his monstrous mother, no one would believe it, though Peter\u2019s executor says that the portrait he ends up supplying actually \u201cerrs on the side of understatement\u201d.</p> <p>Growing up, Bailey felt instinctively close to the past. His father, who died when he was 11, had fought at Flanders and was 51 at time of his birth. Bailey\u2019s own imagination was steeped less in rock\u2019n\u2019roll than in music hall. In Battersea, there were not only \u201csoot-encrusted\u201d industrial buildings but also remnants of the Thames-side village. As an adolescent he went on long walks, visiting churches and museums, encountering habits and attitudes whose dying days he preserved in his work.</p> <p>Bailey developed a love of literature, but instead of university, he went to the Central School of Speech and Drama, determined to play Hamlet or Richard II.

      "body": "<p>There is a tough lesson that senior Labour advisers want some of their internal party critics to learn from the Democrats\u2019 disastrous defeat. Optimism is not the answer they think it is.</p> <p>When Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign had the most momentum, the core of it was joy. And although the final weeks were dominated by darker warnings of fascism under Donald Trump, Harris returned to that theme of optimism in one of her final messages to supporters, saying they had \u201cbrought back the joy\u201d.</p> <p>Senior Labour insiders are privately scathing about those tactics. \u201cThe final days were a parade of celebrities in the middle of a cost of living crisis,\u201d said one.</p> <p>Another said it was a warning to those inside their own tent who had called for more optimism, more joy. \u201cHow\u2019s that working out?\u201d one said. Another described the Democrats as \u201crunning on vibes rather than an argument\u201d.</p> <p>For several of those plotting the government\u2019s strategy and messaging, this is a hard but necessary truth \u2013 when life is very tough, joy is not the right tone. They believe that it vindicates Keir Starmer\u2019s decision to keep underlining how he understands that life for many in Britain is difficult.</p> <p>Many in the party will still disagree: they hate the funereal tone and believe it is giving voters licence to give up all hope in this government already. At worst, it gives quarter to the dark forces in UK politics who will sell the idea that politicians will change nothing.</p> <p>In No 10 there is a grim-faced resolve to keep party communications focused on realism \u2013 an acknowledgment of the hard times and a roadmap of how that will change.</p> <p>The result in the US is evidence, writ-large, of the scale of the challenge Labour faces at the next election. Biden\u2019s was an incumbent government felled by the economy \u2013 despite the creation of 15m jobs, the highest growth in the G7 and wage increases of almost 20%. But it was inflation, the rising cost of simple necessities such as bread and eggs, that voters cited.</p> <p>On this side of the Atlantic, that lesson is already being learned. It has meant the unceremonial ditching of the language of Starmer\u2019s first \u201cmission\u201d on the economy. It wasn\u2019t working.

      "bodyText": "There is a tough lesson that senior Labour advisers want some of their internal party critics to learn from the Democrats\u2019 disastrous defeat. Optimism is not the answer they think it is. When Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign had the most momentum, the core of it was joy. And although the final weeks were dominated by darker warnings of fascism under Donald Trump, Harris returned to that theme of optimism in one of her final messages to supporters, saying they had \u201cbrought back the joy\u201d. Senior Labour insiders are privately scathing about those tactics. \u201cThe final days were a parade of celebrities in the middle of a cost of living crisis,\u201d said one. Another said it was a warning to those inside their own tent who had called for more optimism, more joy. \u201cHow\u2019s that working out?\u201d one said. Another described the Democrats as \u201crunning on vibes rather than an argument\u201d. For several of those plotting the government\u2019s strategy and messaging, this is a hard but necessary truth \u2013 when life is very tough, joy is not the right tone. They believe that it vindicates Keir Starmer\u2019s decision to keep underlining how he understands that life for many in Britain is difficult. Many in the party will still disagree: they hate the funereal tone and believe it is giving voters licence to give up all hope in this government already. At worst, it gives quarter to the dark forces in UK politics who will sell the idea that politicians will change nothing. In No 10 there is a grim-faced resolve to keep party communications focused on realism \u2013 an acknowledgment of the hard times and a roadmap of how that will change. The result in the US is evidence, writ-large, of the scale of the challenge Labour faces at the next election. Biden\u2019s was an incumbent government felled by the economy \u2013 despite the creation of 15m jobs, the highest growth in the G7 and wage increases of almost 20%. But it was inflation, the rising cost of simple necessities such as bread and eggs, that voters cited. On this side of the Atlantic, that lesson is already being learned. It has meant the unceremonial ditching of the language of Starmer\u2019s first \u201cmission\u201d on the economy. It wasn\u2019t working. No voter wants to hear about the highest growth in the G7, they want to hear about the price of a Tesco shop. Another example UK strategists cite is the number of jobs that Biden\u2019s administration created. But for those already in a low-paid job, that statistic was completely irrelevant. It sounded like bragging. It did nothing to help their day-to-day costs. And the campaign had another lesson the party wants to hammer home to its activists and MPs \u2013 that voters will set the agenda, not politicians. In the US, polls repeatedly suggested the top two issues for voters were the economy and immigration. \u201cThen you need to talk about the economy and immigration,\u201d one strategist said. \u201cThe Labour party had a habit in the past of saying, \u2018Oh no, we don\u2019t want to talk about those issues. We want to try and make the election about a different question\u2019. \u201cNo matter how hard the Democrats tried to make it about something else, whether it was about reproductive freedom or anything else, that wasn\u2019t what voters had front and centre of their minds going into the election.\u201d For those in the Labour government who watched the US election the closest, they clocked early the discipline of the Trump campaign, even when their own X algorithms were serving them constant clips of the former president\u2019s gaffes. Trump can hardly be described as a poster boy for message discipline.

      "body": "<p>Martin Kettle is right: Britain has clung too long to illusion and lazy imitation of the US (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/06/us-election-donald-trump-new-world-order\">The shocking US election result will create a new world order \u2013 and launch a fresh wave of Trump wannabes, 6 November</a>). Every dark cloud has a silver lining, and the upside of Donald Trump\u2019s election is possibly that British politicians will at last learn not to use the pathetic phraseology of the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d. Trump already knows what our prime minister and foreign secretary really think of him, and we already know that Trump would prefer to deal with the likes of Nigel Farage.</p> <p>The dumping of this special relationship nonsense is well overdue, and should have happened as long ago as 1956, when&nbsp;President Dwight Eisenhower directed the British government to stop its military adventures around Suez, and to go home at once and behave. Ironically, since then, the special relationship has more often been used by the US to drag Britain into unwise military actions, rather than to put a stop to them.</p> <p>In today\u2019s dangerous times, Britain can no longer fulfil the Churchillian pledge to \u201cstand alone\u201d. In a world dominated by the autocratic and narcissistic leaders of Russia, China and a protectionist, inward-looking and xenophobic US, the rational choice for British politicians is to align as closely as possible with our nearest democratic neighbours. The obvious path to take is towards rejoining the European Union.<br><strong>Dr Charles Smith</strong><br><em>Bridgend</em></p> <p>\u2022 I always appreciate Martin Kettle\u2019s thoughtful pieces, but I do feel the analysis of Donald Trump\u2019s re-election has missed a point. And I say this having lived in the US in the 1990s, when a Democrat with deep personal flaws also won re-election. It is possible when looking at Trump from the left to always overthink it. People have not considered the postwar consensus on rules-based liberal politics and rejected it. They have voted for a party and a person they believe will make them better off.</p> <p>In the rural south or the wide open spaces of the west, and even in the inner cities, people have voted on the cost of living and their families\u2019 prospects.

      "bodyText": "Martin Kettle is right: Britain has clung too long to illusion and lazy imitation of the US (The shocking US election result will create a new world order \u2013 and launch a fresh wave of Trump wannabes, 6 November). Every dark cloud has a silver lining, and the upside of Donald Trump\u2019s election is possibly that British politicians will at last learn not to use the pathetic phraseology of the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d. Trump already knows what our prime minister and foreign secretary really think of him, and we already know that Trump would prefer to deal with the likes of Nigel Farage. The dumping of this special relationship nonsense is well overdue, and should have happened as long ago as 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower directed the British government to stop its military adventures around Suez, and to go home at once and behave. Ironically, since then, the special relationship has more often been used by the US to drag Britain into unwise military actions, rather than to put a stop to them. In today\u2019s dangerous times, Britain can no longer fulfil the Churchillian pledge to \u201cstand alone\u201d. In a world dominated by the autocratic and narcissistic leaders of Russia, China and a protectionist, inward-looking and xenophobic US, the rational choice for British politicians is to align as closely as possible with our nearest democratic neighbours. The obvious path to take is towards rejoining the European Union. Dr Charles Smith Bridgend \u2022 I always appreciate Martin Kettle\u2019s thoughtful pieces, but I do feel the analysis of Donald Trump\u2019s re-election has missed a point. And I say this having lived in the US in the 1990s, when a Democrat with deep personal flaws also won re-election. It is possible when looking at Trump from the left to always overthink it. People have not considered the postwar consensus on rules-based liberal politics and rejected it. They have voted for a party and a person they believe will make them better off. In the rural south or the wide open spaces of the west, and even in the inner cities, people have voted on the cost of living and their families\u2019 prospects. We have just seen the Tories turfed out on the same basis here. And anyone who knows the US will also know that, outside of a few small enclaves, foreign policy plays little part in electoral choices, let alone the principles underlying it. In the US, and to an extent here in Britain, the centre-left has left its old constituencies behind and they have turned to something else, not out of conviction but abandonment. That is the challenge for the left in the next years. It is time to recognise that we need a different approach to looking after the interests of those who have been so badly affected by pandemics, energy shocks and instability. Mark Hammond Chichester \u2022 Martin Kettle highlights several concerns that those of us with a progressive internationalist worldview fear for the next four years. However, by questioning the extent of the cultural ties that exist between the peoples of the US and these British Isles, he risks exacerbating the potential political rift that we now face. Rather than pulling back from a \u201cdystrumpian\u201d US, we should instead be redoubling our efforts to appeal to the hearts and minds of our closest friends with whom we still share a common purpose in making the world a better place. The democratic process often throws up challenges, but we need to embrace them and meet them, not retreat. That way, tyranny certainly lies.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump could be offered a second state visit to the UK, it has emerged, because of the change of both the government and the monarch since he was last invited. However, government sources have denied claims from Nigel Farage that an invitation has already been extended by the House of Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, for the US president-elect to address both Houses of Parliament. His predecessor, John Bercow, had said he would block any invitation to Trump to address parliament during his state visit in 2019. Trump was hosted at Buckingham Palace for a state visit by Queen Elizabeth in 2019, while Theresa May was prime minister. No other world leader has been hosted twice for an official state visit though the French president Jacques Chirac was hosted by the Queen both in 1996 and 2004, the latter called a \u201cspecial visit\u201d commemorating the centenary of the Entente Cordiale. But government sources said a second state visit for Trump should not be ruled out because of three differences since 2019 \u2013 the gap between his presidencies, the change of government from Conservatives to Labour, and the new monarch, Charles III. It is not routine for US presidents to be asked to address parliament during state visits, however. The last US president to do so was Barack Obama. Joe Biden, as US president, did not even receive a full state visit hosted by the monarch \u2013 though his presidency included the last year of the pandemic and the death of the Queen and Charles III\u2019s subsequent coronation. Farage told his Reform UK party\u2019s Welsh rally on Friday: \u201cI do think having Sir Lindsay Hoyle there as the speaker compared to that ghastly little pipsqueak Bercow that went before is an improvement.

      "body": "<p>The seemingly never-ending obsession with Wallis Simpson on the part of writers, publishers and (presumably) readers is at this point beginning to seem quite crazed. What more can there be left to say? But always, another book; and always, the <em>Daily Mail </em>will make the most of the scraps it dishes up. Paul French\u2019s <em>Her Lotus Year</em> claims to tell \u201cfor the first time\u201d the full story of the months the future Duchess of Windsor spent in China in the mid-1920s. Not only does it arrive highly praised by other Simpson biographers (it\u2019s as if they all belong to a syndicate or something), but the <em>Mail </em>has already run a helpfully piquant piece featuring the sexual techniques Simpson supposedly learned while she was up to nothing-very-much in Hong Kong, Shanghai and what was then Peking.</p> <p>Only there\u2019s a problem here. French\u2019s book, like others before it, wholly debunks the existence of the so-called \u201cChina Dossier\u201d, a document reputedly used by the British establishment to besmirch Simpson\u2019s name at the time of the abdication. The rumours that then swirled round Edward VIII\u2019s American divorcee \u2013 that she frequented brothels, was addicted to opium and modelled for pornographic photographs \u2013 have, he says, no basis in reality. If she did indeed know how to perform the infamous Singapore grip \u2013 pelvic floor exercises <em>avant la lettre \u2013</em> it was a secret kept between Simpson and her lovers (of which she did, at least, have several). Such stories were then, as now, only gossip: \u201cVenom, venom, VENOM,\u201d as Simpson put it.</p> <p>French is a China specialist, and he has delved into every aspect of the period she was there, from the battles its warlords were then constantly fighting to the standard of room service at the hotels in which she stayed. But however thorough his research, the realities of Simpson\u2019s life in the east remain somewhat less interesting than the myths. At times, his book reads like an old Baedeker guide, all ships and trains and recommended restaurants. Yes, the danger involved for a lone young woman travelling across China when it was close to civil war hugely increases your admiration for Simpson (though, admittedly, the bar is low). But for atmosphere, French has to fall back on accounts other than her own. Broadly speaking, we\u2019re in the realm of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/13/secret-lives-somerset-maugham\">W Somerset Maugham</a>\u2019s scandalous novel of 1925, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-painted-veil-9780099286875/\">The Painted Veil</a></em><em> </em>\u2013 and to be honest, there were many moments as I read <em>Her Lotus Year</em> when I longed to be holding Maugham\u2019s brilliant book in my hands instead.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She loved Chinese food \u2013 and for afters, there was her Italian lover, Alberto da Zara, a gunboat commander with 'impeccable manners'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Simpson arrived in Hong Kong from Virginia in September 1924 for a reunion with her estranged first husband, Win Spencer, an American navy officer and heavy drinker who used a large consomm\u00e9 bowl for his dry martinis. At first, all was well. The pair enjoyed a (dry) second honeymoon at a swanky resort. But soon Spencer was back on the booze, at which point Wallis decided to make for Shanghai, accompanied by another naval wife, Mary Sadler (she would later divorce him). As seems to have been the case wherever she travelled, there Simpson immediately made contact with a well-connected man \u2013 in this instance, an architect called Harold Graham Fector Robinson (\u201cRobbie\u201d) \u2013 and he manfully introduced her to the city\u2019s wealthiest circles. Together, they went to tea dances and the races; when he was working, Simpson shopped, something at which she was very good (later, she would raise funds by \u201ccurio\u201d hunting, jade a speciality).</p> <p>But however sybaritic her lifestyle \u2013 according to Maugham, expat dinner tables \u201cgroaned with silver\u201d \u2013 she stayed in Shanghai, modern and bustling, only a few weeks. Her eye was on the north: a different proposition altogether. She and Sadler left in early December, were detained in the port of Tientsin en route, after which she proceeded alone to Peking, her friend having got cold feet (bandits were said to hold up the trains). How was Simpson able to travel alone like this, and to fund her grand hotels on arrival? Why was she always met at her destination by high-ranking officials? French speculates she was a US government courier, transporting documents, which is plausible but doesn\u2019t fully explain her motivation. War and typhoid were raging, and yet this young woman (she was 28), alone and meagrely resourced, was determined to establish herself in inaccessible Peking. For good or ill, there is something buccaneering about her.</p> <p>The last section of the book, devoted to the Peking months, is by far the most beguiling. In 1925, the city still had 3,000 ancient hutongs (traditional alleys), and it was on one of these that Simpson made her home, having been invited to live with a wealthy American couple, Kitty and Herman Rogers. French insists Simpson had no way of knowing that Kitty was living in Peking, but it was serendipitous nonetheless: her own living quarters and rickshaw puller; early morning pony rides on the city\u2019s Tartar Wall; country weekends at the temple the Rogers rented, where tiny bells tinkled on vermilion eaves. Simpson may well have mastered only four words in the dialect \u2013 \u201cBoy, pass the champagne!\u201d \u2013 but in every other respect, she was as embedded in Peking life as a foreigner could be. She loved Chinese food \u2013 and for afters, there was her Italian lover, Alberto da Zara, a gunboat commander with \u201cimpeccable manners\u201d.</p> <p>Why did she leave? On 30 May 1925, there was an incident 750 miles away in Shanghai. Protesters demonstrating against the arrest of students who\u2019d criticised foreign imperialism were shot; four died, and more were wounded. Membership of the Communist party grew; protests, strikes and boycotts erupted elsewhere. One night Wallis arrived for dinner at the home of a British attache, only to find that his \u201cnumber one boy\u201d (a servant) had walked out. Her time was clearly up, and as the summer rains arrived, she began the long journey home. Later, she would look back on her stay in the country as \u201cthe most delightful interval\u201d of her youth. But its influence on her was mostly aesthetic \u2013 when Man Ray photographed her in 1936, her Chinese-influenced Mainbocher gown competed for attention with a statue of Guan Yu, the god of war \u2013 and what knowing more about it adds to the sum of history is really anyone\u2019s guess.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Her Lotus Year: China, the Roaring Twenties, and the Making of Wallis Simpson</em> by Paul French is published by Elliott &amp; Thompson (\u00a325).

Nineteen changes to the football governance bill have been proposed by Fair Game, an organisation of 34 men\u2019s clubs that argues for a more sustainable approach to running the national sport.</p> <p>Other proposals include the addition of a human rights component to owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 tests and a mandate to disclose the source of an owner\u2019s funds.

      "bodyText": "That is all from me today but fear not, for there is more football to enjoy. Dominic Booth is gearing up for an incredibly important match at Stamford Bridge: Chelsea v Arsenal. Follow along to his MBM here. Thank you for tuning in and for your emails as always. Catch you next time! And Nick Ames was at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium: The ball was heading in but Delap, such a thrilling prospect at 21, showed a poacher\u2019s instinct to convert his sixth of the season. Ed Sheeran, watching from the stands as Ipswich played for the first time in a pink kit whose design he partly influenced, could join the visiting contingent in celebrating wildly. These had hardly been bolts from the blue. Within two minutes Szmodics had forced a save from Vicario after more excellent work from Hutchinson and, after nine, Cameron Burgess had leapt at the far post to plant Davis\u2019s corner on to the bar. Jamie Jackson\u2019s verdict from Old Trafford: Fernandes\u2019s goal was his fourth of Van Nistelrooy\u2019s brief reign after zero for Erik ten Hag in the captain\u2019s previous 17 outings, a run that stretched back to April. Ten Hag, of course, has been replaced by R\u00faben Amorim, whose opening day as the new head coach is Monday, as United hope their latest reset is finally the right one. John Brewin writes from the City Ground: Forest had seen out a first half in which they had reduced their opponent to scraps but with Gordon switched to the left, Newcastle began their second half with renewed fire, Bruno soon whistling a shot wide with his outstep, as Forest\u2019s defenders \u2013 and Sels \u2013 were forced into increased last-ditch stuff. Forest retained some danger on the counter but after Nicol\u00e1s Dom\u00ednguez was sent through on the halfway line, only for Nick Pope to make a save, they lost control of the game. The Premier League table as it stands. Nottingham Forest 1-3 Newcastle: Forest never really were able to get out of second gear, which is a huge credit to Newcastle. Barnes was the super-sub of the day after constantly getting the better of Nuno\u2019s defence and Howe will now be hoping his side can kick on. It is a small setback in Forest\u2019s brilliant start but a reminder for them that they will have to maintain previous levels in the busy Christmas period. Just as they have launched to the top half of the table, it is just as easy to come tumbling down. Manchester United 3-0 Leicester: It really looked like Ruud van Nistelrooy was saying goodbye to the Old Trafford faithful at the final whistle. He shook the hands of every member of the staff and the players before applauding the fans and he is still on the pitch. He has made it clear that he would like to stay at the club as an assistant but it is ultimately up to R\u00faben Amorim, who may want to bring his current staff from Sporting. Tottenham 1-2 Ipswich: Huge celebrations from the Ipswich players who fall to the ground in jubilation at their first win of the season. Their first-half performance was marked by brave attacking play and they showed a lot of fight to ensure that they would not concede in the final moments despite Spurs\u2019 relentless pressure. The win also takes them out of the relegation zone. Manchester United 3-0 Leicester Nottingham Forest 1-3 Newcastle Tottenham 1-2 Ipswich Tottenham 1-2 Ipswich: Spurs win a free-kick 25 yards out \u2026 and wow, it is a poor ball from Porro. Huge roar from the Ipswich fans! It has been 22 years since they last won a Premier League game! Tottenham 1-2 Ipswich: What a save! Muric denies Solanke after the ball falls luckily to him. Muric makes himself big and blocks the shot with his legs! The full-time whistle has gone at Old Trafford and the City Ground but it\u2019s still ticking away at Tottenham \u2026 Tottenham 1-2 Leicester: Bissouma fouls Hutchinson to give Ipswich a free-kick. Just what they wanted and they will surely take their time to line up. Manchester United 3-0 Leicester: Amad is looking for a fourth as he cuts the ball back to Zirkzee but Leicester intercept. Tottenham 1-2 Ipswich: We get eight minutes of injury time \u2026 Ipswich have been trying to keep the ball in the corner for the last 10 minutes. Tottenham 1-2 Ipswich: Werner counters and finds Son who gives it back but it\u2019s high and wide! Great comeback for the Magpies! Another counterattack sees Barnes with the ball in the box. He cuts inside on his right and hits it low to give his side their third. A stunner from the substitute! As soon as he comes on the pitch, things happen. Eriksen sets up United for a counterattack and it ends with Garnacho picks the top corner. Manchester United 2-0 Leicester: Bit of a calmer half at Old Trafford. Leicester seem to have little ideas and United are happy to keep their lead. Tottenham 1-2 Ipswich: The visitors have really lost their heads since conceding. There is huge pressure to win this one now and it does not help that the crowd is firmly against them. Werner tries to take a chance but is fouled before he can get the shot off. All that praise for Forest but Howe\u2019s side have turned it around at the City Ground! It is a cracking finish after Joelinton curls a shot from his left foot which whacks the post before going in. Here we go! Bentancur is left completely unmarked to head a corner into the top corner from about eight yards out. Are the Tractor Boys going to let it slip again? Nottingham Forest 1-1 Newcastle: Isak surely should get his second \u2026 but he misses! His volley is just on the wrong side of the post after Willock put it on a plate for him. Nottingham Forest 1-1 Newcastle: Taylor books Yates for a pull back on Isak. It is the player\u2019s fourth foul of the match so he is really quite lucky. Tottenham 0-2 Ipswich: Spurs denied a penalty by VAR! The ball hits Davis on the arm. It was from close range and VAR take a look but nothing given. Manchester United 2-0 Leicester: Fernandes is not happy. He is down holding his head but the substitutions don\u2019t include him as Rashford and Dalot are the ones who come off. He is on the sideline but should be OK to come back on. Perfect start to the half for Newcastle! Isak takes a chance with a first-time shot across goal and it hits the post on the way in. Great work from Longstaff to keep the ball alive from the corner. Solanke has the ball in the back of the net after Rodrigo Bentancur flicks on Pedro Porro\u2019s corner to the striker but VAR takes a look and it is obvious \u2026 the ball touches his arm on the way in. Nottingham Forest 1-0 Newcastle: Chance for the visitors! Guimar\u00e3es somehow hits a curling shot with the outside of his boot but it is just over the bar. The late match will certainly be an intriguing one. Find out the team news for the London derby along with my colleague Dominic Booth. And we\u2019re back underway across all the grounds! Fernandes\u2019 second goal has been snatched from him and given as a Kristiansen own-goal. Right decision, really. Sheffield United\u2019s tight victory in the tight Sheffield derby was incredibly important for Chris Wilder, writes Aaron Bower at Bramall Lane. After the disappointment of last season\u2019s rather humiliating relegation from the Premier League, Wilder looks to have rebuilt his boyhood club and put them in a strong position for an immediate return. He, more than most, will have savoured this result, with this his first home derby victory as a manager. A well-earned win for Chelsea in the WSL at Liverpool, which was dubbed pre-match as a possible tough test for Sonia Bompastor. Tom Garry writes from the Totally Wicked Stadium: Sunday\u2019s meeting on a grey afternoon in St Helens contrasted with the engrossing 4-3 thriller in which Liverpool stunned Chelsea towards the end of last season and, briefly, had prompted their former manager Emma Hayes to concede a title that they went on to win regardless. Chelsea were never in such jeopardy this time. Half-time emails! Peter (like all of us) laments some refereeing decisions: So good to see Anthony Taylor maintaining his ineptitude and his influence on the Premier league with no calls,wrong calls and plain ignorance as to the application of laws. A perfect study of \u201cmy way, the only way\u201d. Agreed, not the best half from him. Yates with a couple of poor challenges and not even a booking and a very obvious Elanga foul on Willock as well \u2026 Frustrating in what has otherwise been an entertaining game. Rick\u2019s thoughts on Fernandes: Bruno Fernandes may not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but his scoring record and assists in the PL are surely Lampardesque? Don\u2019t know how many assists he has since he joined United but a goal every three games is pretty amazing for a midfielder. I sense he wasn\u2019t Ten Hag\u2019s biggest fan so Amorim will probably be far more to his liking. In 170 appearances, Fernandes has scored 56 and assisted 43, so a goal contribution every 1.7 games. Lampard in 609 appearances scored 177 and assisted 102, which equals a goal contribution every 2.2 games. Simon on the title race: I know it\u2019s still early days, and that City are capable of winning twenty games in a row, but you do get the sense that this season\u2019s Premier League title is Liverpool\u2019s to lose. Unless Forest do a Leicester, of course. Or Man United. Dilly ding dilly dong! Jeremy on Nuno\u2019s hopes and dreams: Wow. Nuno must be pinching himself to make sure he\u2019s not dreaming, and having a good laugh when he realises he\u2019s wide awake. He has done much the best of all the people on the Midlands Management Merry-go-round. I thought he did a great job at Wolves and was badly treated in the end, he did his best despite having all his best players sold from under him. And where has sacking him got them? If Forest win today they move to within a point of \u201ctroubled\u201d Citeh, how long before they can start dreaming of Champions League footie? 45 years after they put the boot in on Europe\u2019s high-and-mighty it would be great to see them back in it, and give the other CL teams plenty to contemplate. K\u00e1ri\u2019s Tottenham adversity hypothesis I have a hypothesis that Ange\u2019s Spurs need to be losing to play at the intensity that Postecoglou\u2019s system relies on. But it will take an almighty jolt of adrenaline to get them out of their torpor today, even against a team that on paper Tottenham should swat aside. Manchester United 2-0 Leicester Nottingham Forest 1-0 Newcastle Tottenham 0-2 Ipswich Manchester United 2-0 Ipswich: Huge save from Hermansen to deny Amad! The United player darts beyond three Leicester players and it looks like a sure goal after a counterattack but the Leicester keeper saves it with the tip of his toes after initially diving the wrong way. A quick breakaway for the visitors and Spurs make it too easy to be cut through. Szmodics drives a low ball and it ping-pongs around before Delap hits it home on the goalline. Will Ipswich\u2019s first win of the season be in north London in their bright pink kits? Just like he did in the Cup, the United captain has a brace against Leicester. It is a bit messy but he won\u2019t care. Fernandes misses the header after Mazraoui\u2019s cross and although it does touch his body, the ball only veers on target after a touch from Kristiansen. Might be changed to an own-goal later. A bicycle-kick gives the visitors the lead after Cajuste swings in a delivery. Delap tries to go for goal but ends up looping it over to Szmodics who, with his back to goal, controls an overhead kick. Spurs fall behind again at home! Tottenham 0-0 Ipswich: Leif Davis decides to take matters into his own hands as he runs out of defence and surges forward. He is about to lose the ball but is then fouled. Incredible delivery from an Elanga free-kick and Murillo is the first to react, running onto the front post to nod home his first Forest goal. Poor defending from Newcastle. Tottenham 0-0 Ipswich: Solanke shows some great hold up play but his low strike is pushed behind by Muric. A super finish to celebrate his 250th game in the club. After a quick give-and-go with a stunning back heel assist from Amad, Fernandes drifts just outside of the penalty area and powers a low curling shot into the bottom corner. Great goal! Manchester United 0-0 Leicester: The hosts win a corner but it does not go past the first man. Fernandes faces the sky in disbelief. Nottingham Forest 0-0 Newcastle: Hudson-Odoi clumsily gives the ball away, giving Willock the chance to take a shot but it\u2019s wide at the far post. Tottenham 0-0 Ipswich: Son finds Johnson at the near post but the latter\u2019s shot is just wide. Nottingham Forest 0-0 Newcastle: Forest win an early free-kick and Elanga puts a peach of a ball in that causes mayhem in the box. It falls to Wood, which would surely cause panic given his form, and his close-range shot is blocked by Hall \u2026 and the flag goes up anyway. Manchester United 0-0 Leicester: The visitors lose the ball and United surge forward and they try to be patient in their buildup. Fernandes eventually finds H\u00f8jlund but Leicester clear. United putting lots of pressure early on, though. After a moment of silence and a rendition of the Last Post for Remembrance Sunday we are off! Manchester United 0-0 Leicester Nottingham Forest 0-0 Newcastle Tottenham 0-0 Ipswich Some emails before we get to kick-off! Krishna could not be more cheerful: Will the human rights watchdog be managed by Saudi Arabia in the first year, followed by Qatar, then Kuwait, later Dubai and so on \u2026 Sorry for being a cynic but I could not help it \u2013 the music that was City losing AGAIN yesterday could be completed as a proper encore today should Forest continue their magical mystery tour. And Eric names his price (sort of): Good morning from Pittsburgh! Looking forward to a couple of things in today\u2019s undercard (yes, that\u2019s what we all are thinking). Newcastle spent big to pluck Chris Wood from relegation-doomed Burnley and proceeded to deem him surplus in just one calendar year. Rude. He got a hat-trick at St James\u2019 Park last season; I\u2019ve got a neutral\u2019s hope he has massive fun today, heh heh. I\u2019ve never seen an entire team phone it in (if that\u2019s what the kids still say) the way I can imagine Manchester United doing today. An often indifferent home crowd, a relegation candidate for an opponent, a lame-duck coach, an international window beckoning. You couldn\u2019t pay me to go to Old Trafford to subject myself to that rubbish. (Well, you could, but I have a high price.) Bruno Fernandes is celebrating 25o games with Manchester United today and Jim Ratcliffe has presented him a plaque to honour the occasion. In his time at the club, the now club captain has scored 82 goals and won two trophies. Before we start in the Premier League, follow along to our MBM coverage of Liverpool v Chelsea in the WSL. Nuno with some words on his squad depth before the game. The late one tonight is Arsenal at Chelsea. Rob Draper heaps praise on William Saliba who cost \u00a325m while Chelsea signed his teammate Wesley Fofana for \u00a370m. And Jacob Steinberg analyses Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s struggles after the emergence of Rom\u00e9o Lavia\u2019s partnership with Mois\u00e9s Caicedo in central midfield. Paul MacInnes with some big news that will certainly affect the Premier League. Proposed changes to the football regulator that would ensure clubs could not be sold to nation states are to be put before the House of Lords, as legislation returns to parliament this week. Nineteen changes to the football governance bill have been proposed by Fair Game, an organisation of 34 men\u2019s clubs that argues for a more sustainable approach to running the national sport. Other proposals include the addition of a human rights component to owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 tests and a mandate to disclose the source of an owner\u2019s funds. The text of the proposed amendment on state ownership says: \u201cThe Bill must exclude the possibility that an owner of a club could be a state or state-controlled person or entity. Nottingham Forest are now third in the Premier League table, a feat not many predicted at the start of the season. Jonathan Wilson believes it is because Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo is where he is comfortable and his plan \u2013 amid all the background turmoil \u2013 is not especially complicated. Forest have had the third-lowest possession in the league this season \u2013 but it works. Or at least, works for them. A club with a more heightened sense of self-worth might insist on having more of the ball, on something more sophisticated, but simplicity has its own charm. Read more here. The current Premier League table as it stands. A sending off at Palace, goals galore in Brentford, a first win for Wolves, City\u2019s downward spiral and Liverpool\u2019s counterattacks are aplenty \u2026 it has been an exciting weekend of Premier League football so far. And the good news is there is more to come. Our afternoon matches see Leicester head to Old Trafford for Ruud van Nistelrooy\u2019s last game in charge, an in-form Forest side hosting Newcastle and Spurs hoping to bounce back from European embarrassment against a desperate Ipswich. Join me for all the goals and the big moments in the 2pm GMT kick-offs. And, as always, send any thoughts, predictions, questions, or complaints you would like to share to me via email.",

Fernandes targeted Casemiro with the free-kick but the visitors cleared.</p> \n<p>United hemmed Leicester in. Any forays were on the counter, as when Fatawu mugged Casemiro and the ball went to Wilfred Ndidi, but the home team escaped.</p> \n<p>The first of Diallo\u2019s double in Thursday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/07/manchester-united-paok-europa-league-match-report\">2-0 Europa League victory over Paok</a> was a craftily looped header, and here United attempted a repeat. Marcus Rashford dropped the ball in from the left towards the far post where Diallo lurked, but Kristiansen headed out.</p> \n<p>The Leicester defender was to have a shocker for Fernandes\u2019s opener. With his side on the attack, a long United clearance caused Kristiansen to hesitate: fatal if Diallo is closing down. He was, he took the ball, and made a turbo-charged run on goal. The ball went for a throw-in and, again, Diallo starred. Noussair Mazraoui found Fernandes, who rolled the ball to Diallo. By appearing casual the Ivorian duped Steve Cooper\u2019s team and allowed a moment of brilliance: the backheeled return to Fernandes, who skipped forward and fashioned a peach of a curler that defeated Hermansen into his bottom left corner.</p> \n<p>United were in raptures, the goalkeeper furious at those slumbering in front of him \u2013 understandably. These emotions soon nearly tilted. Ndidi was not tracked as he ran in behind, Facundo Buonanotte chipped over, but the midfielder failed to beat Andr\u00e9 Onana at close range.</p> \n<p>Cue a Van Nistelrooy fit at the lack of a runner with Ndidi.

      "bodyText": "Eleven days after Manchester United routed Leicester under Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Carabao Cup here, the interim manager signed off with another easy-street win over the Foxes and so ends his four-game term unbeaten. In all the Dutchman has three victories, and for this one he could thank Bruno Fernandes, who graced a 250th United appearance by scoring the first goal and causing enough trouble for the hapless Victor Kristiansen to bundle past his goalkeeper, Mads Hermansen, for the second. Fernandes\u2019s goal was a fourth of Van Nistelrooy\u2019s brief reign after zero for Erik ten Hag in the captain\u2019s previous 17 outings, a run that stretched back to April. Ten Hag has been replaced by R\u00faben Amorim, whose opening day as the new head coach is due to be on Monday, as United hope their latest reset is finally the right one. Fernandes said: \u201cIt was a long time that I wasn\u2019t scoring and now goals are coming in the last few games.\u201d In an unsurprising move, Van Nistelrooy\u2019s one change from the XI that drew with Chelsea last Sunday was finding a place for the explosive aggression of Amad Diallo \u2013 Alejandro Garnacho was the fall guy \u2013 and his thrust had the visitors on their heels throughout. One dart swept the 22-year-old deep into Leicester territory and provoked Abdul Fatawu into upending him. Fernandes targeted Casemiro with the free-kick but the visitors cleared. United hemmed Leicester in. Any forays were on the counter, as when Fatawu mugged Casemiro and the ball went to Wilfred Ndidi, but the home team escaped. The first of Diallo\u2019s double in Thursday\u2019s 2-0 Europa League victory over Paok was a craftily looped header, and here United attempted a repeat. Marcus Rashford dropped the ball in from the left towards the far post where Diallo lurked, but Kristiansen headed out. The Leicester defender was to have a shocker for Fernandes\u2019s opener. With his side on the attack, a long United clearance caused Kristiansen to hesitate: fatal if Diallo is closing down. He was, he took the ball, and made a turbo-charged run on goal. The ball went for a throw-in and, again, Diallo starred. Noussair Mazraoui found Fernandes, who rolled the ball to Diallo. By appearing casual the Ivorian duped Steve Cooper\u2019s team and allowed a moment of brilliance: the backheeled return to Fernandes, who skipped forward and fashioned a peach of a curler that defeated Hermansen into his bottom left corner. United were in raptures, the goalkeeper furious at those slumbering in front of him \u2013 understandably. These emotions soon nearly tilted. Ndidi was not tracked as he ran in behind, Facundo Buonanotte chipped over, but the midfielder failed to beat Andr\u00e9 Onana at close range. Cue a Van Nistelrooy fit at the lack of a runner with Ndidi. Yet overall United were akin to a boxer ahead on points keeping the opposing pugilist at arm\u2019s length with their jab: of this, Harry Winks\u2019 hit-and-hope effort was emblematic. But the gaps in midfield remained in quick transition and so Winks\u2019 lob into Buonanotte left United scrambling and Mazraoui appearing to take him down. This occurred on the borderline of the area but Peter Bankes gave neither penalty or free-kick, the referee invoking the travelling faithful\u2019s ire. A far more sour pill was theirs to swallow next, in what was a calamity of errors from those in blue. Mazraoui\u2019s flighted delivery was missed comically by both Jannik Vestergaard and Wout Faes, and Kristiansen\u2019s nightmare continued as the ball glanced off the marauding Fernandes\u2019 thigh and pinged in off the defender for an own goal and 2-0. The half ended with Diallo \u2013 who else? \u2013 burning a hole through Leicester and shooting, though the sharp Hermansen beat his effort away. Could United close this out? Being unable to seal the deal has been one of their major faults. Manuel Ugarte was a fire-dousing dynamo who did his best to ensure they did so. A chop of Buonanotte that gave a free-kick near United\u2019s D was due to this enthusiasm but the hash Leicester made of the dead ball let him off the hook. On 57 minutes Van Nistelrooy removed a disappointing Rashford for Garnacho and Diogo Dalot for Jonny Evans (perhaps for a knock), Lisandro Mart\u00ednez moving to left-back and Mazraoui to right-back. After a clip on the ankle that needed treatment, Mart\u00ednez fed Garnacho but he muddled down a cul-de-sac near the left corner flag and James Justin mopped up. The winger did the precise same thing after a glorious left-footed 40-yard Ugarte parabola took him clear. As Garnacho reached the area, a cutback on Faes failed, and he fell over. But the 20-year-old laughed last and loudest thanks to a seventh goal of the campaign created by Fernandes\u2019s curving pass and finished by an arrow from the winger that allowed Hermansen scant chance. His celebration was muted. Fernandes said: \u201cGarnacho scored a banger but didn\u2019t celebrate like he should because he thinks he has lost faith from some fans.

A global agreement on carbon markets will be high on the agenda as countries try to find ways of generating the trillions they need to decarbonise in order to limit heating to below 2C above preindustrial levels. Here is what you need to know. What are carbon markets? Carbon markets facilitate the trading of carbon credits. Each credit is equal to a tonne of carbon dioxide that has been reduced or removed from the atmosphere. They come from a wide range of sources: tree-planting schemes, forest protection and renewable energy projects are all common. There are two main types of carbon markets: the unregulated voluntary market, which supplies the majority of offsets used by large companies and was worth less than $1bn last year; and compliance markets, which are regulated cap-and-trade systems that place limits on overall pollution, worth more than $900bn globally in 2023. Over time, cap-and-trade schemes become obsolete once they have achieved their overall environmental goal. Where do they feature in the Paris agreement? Article 6 of the Paris agreement covers how countries are allowed to collaborate in order to fulfil their national obligations.

      "bodyText": "Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said earlier today he had spoken with US president-elect Donald Trump three times in the past few days. At least 23 people, including seven children, were killed and six others injured in an Israeli airstrike on Alamat in Lebanon\u2019s Mount Lebanon province, Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said. Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, reports that 13 children were among 33 civilians who were killed early this morning by an Israeli airstrike that targeted a densely populated home in Jabalia, northern Gaza. In another deadly airstrike, on the Sabra neighbourhood of Gaza City, at least five people were killed, with others still missing, Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency said. At least 43,603 Palestinian people have been killed and 102,929 injured in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza since last October, the Gaza health ministry said. Of those, 51 Palestinians were killed and 164 injured in the latest 24-hour reporting period. Fayyad al-Ruwaili, chief of staff of the armed forces of Saudi Arabia, is expected to visit Tehran today for talks with Iranian officials, state media reported. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reporters have spoken to local people about the devastating Israeli airstrike on Jabalia, in northern Gaza, this morning, in which more than 30 people were killed, including children (see opening summary for more details). The Alloush family would have been getting ready for breakfast on Sunday morning when the airstrike hit their home in Jabalia, according to a relative. At around 6am \u201cthere was a very huge explosion... when we arrived here, all the bodies were torn apart,\u201d Abdullah al-Najjar told AFP from the scene of the attack. \u201cThis is the loaf of bread that they wanted to eat for breakfast. What is the benefit of a loaf of bread if there is no safety and peace?\u201d he asked, holding up pieces of pita. Many others had also been in the Alloush family home, which was being used as \u201ca shelter for people during intensified bombing\u201d, Najjar told AFP. \u201cBut they all died,\u201d he said. We have more information on the Israeli airstrike that hit a residential building in the Sayeda Zainab district south of Damascus (see post at 14:34), which has been the target of previous airstrikes. The Syrian state news agency is reporting the attack resulted in a \u201cnumber of deaths and injuries\u201d, without providing a detailed breakdown. Israeli President Isaac Herzog will meet with the US president, Joe Biden, at the White House on Tuesday to discuss the wars in Gaza and Lebanon, according to a statement from Herzog\u2019s office. An Israeli airstrike targeted a residential building in the Sayeda Zainab district south of Damascus on Sunday, the Syrian state news agency said. It was not immediately clear if there were any casualties. Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes on targets inside government-controlled parts of Syria in recent years, but it rarely acknowledges or discusses them. The strikes often target Syrian forces or Iranian-backed groups. Israeli media outlet Hareetz has quoted Benjamin Netanyahu discussing military actions during a cabinet meeting today. Netanyahu said: When I wanted to eliminate (Hassan) Nasrallah or enter Rafah and other such actions, there were those in the cabinet who opposed it. One of the arguments was the American opposition to the move. I did not agree, and went all the way. Nasrallah, who led Hezbollah for more than three decades, was killed by Israel in a series of strikes on the group\u2019s underground headquarters in Beirut in late September. \u2018 In May, despite warnings of devastating humanitarian consequences, Israel pressed ahead with an offensive on Rafah despite an order from the UN\u2019s top court to halt the assault, which it said was worsening an already \u201cdisastrous\u201d humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territory. Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Sunday he has spoken with US president-elect Donald Trump three times in the past few days aimed at tightening the strong alliance between Israel and the US. \u201cThese were good and very important conversations,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement, according to Reuters. \u201cWe see eye to eye on the Iranian threat in all its components, and the danger posed by it. We also see the great opportunities before Israel, in the field of peace and its expansion, and in other fields.\u201d AFP reports that police in Amsterdam have arrested pro-Palestinian demonstrators. Police had instructed protesters to leave Dam Square in the city centre. Dutch judges had turned down an urgent request for the demonstration. It is not yet clear how many arrests have been made. Police in riot gear moved in on the protesters who were chanting slogans and holding up placards at Dam square in the wake of clashes between Israeli football fans and groups of youths on Thursday. Dutch judges today turned down an urgent request for a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Amsterdam, AFP reports, backing a ban called by its mayor after clashes between Israeli football fans and groups of youth. The Amsterdam district court\u2019s decision comes three days after the Dutch capital was rocked by violence between Maccabi Tel Aviv football fans and men on scooters in several areas of the city. Five Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters were briefly hospitalised in attacks. Amsterdam police have instructed protesters to leave Dam Square, located in the city centre and said it will arrest people who refuse to leave, the city of Amsterdam said on social media platform X. In France, a high police presence is being prepared for the France v Israel Nations League match at the Stade de France in Paris on Thursday. Paris police chief Laurent Nunez described the event as high risk and revealed 4,000 gendarmes would be around the stadium, on public transport and in Paris. At least 23 people, including seven children, were killed and six others injured in an Israeli airstrike on Alamat in Lebanon, the country\u2019s health ministry said in a revised death toll, which is likely to increase throughout the day. The ministry said earlier that at least 20 people, including three children, were killed in the attack (see post at 10.33). At least 20 people, including three children, were killed and six others injured in an Israeli airstrike on Alamat in Lebanon\u2019s Mount Lebanon province, Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said. Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, reports that 13 children were among 33 civilians who were killed early this morning by an Israeli airstrike that targeted a densely populated home in Jabalia, northern Gaza. In another deadly airstrike, on the Sabra neighbourhood of Gaza City, at least five people were killed, with others still missing, Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency said. At least 43,603 Palestinian people have been killed and 102,929 injured in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said. Of those, 51 Palestinians were killed and 164 injured in the latest 24-hour reporting period, the ministry said. Fayyad al-Ruwaili, chief of staff of the armed forces of Saudi Arabia, is expected to visit Tehran today for talks with Iranian officials, state media reported, in a rare high-level meeting since the countries restored ties last year. In an update, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a drone launched at Israel \u201cfrom the east\u201d (reportedly from Iraq) was shot down by the air force this morning, with parts of the drone subsequently landing in an open area in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights. The update came shortly after the IDF reported a barrage of 15 rockets it said was launched from Lebanon at Israel\u2019s Western Galilee region between 12:38-13:39 local time. Most of the rockets \u201cfell in open areas\u201d, the IDF said. Jason Burke is the International security correspondent of the Guardian Aid agencies, medics and witnesses say those trapped by the fighting in Jabaliya and the north of Gaza are suffering appalling conditions, with very limited water, food stocks running out, debris everywhere and continuing bombardment and combat. Food experts this week warned that northern Gaza faces imminent famine. In a rare alert, the independent Famine Review Committee said: \u201cIf no effective action is taken by stakeholders with influence, the scale of this looming catastrophe is likely to dwarf anything we have seen so far in the Gaza Strip since 7 October 2023.\u201d The growing desperation comes as the deadline approaches next week for a 30-day ultimatum the Biden administration gave Israel to raise the level of humanitarian assistance allowed into Gaza or risk restrictions on US military assistance. The US state department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, said Israel had made some progress by announcing the opening of a new crossing into central Gaza and approving new delivery routes. But he said Israel must do more. \u201cIt\u2019s not just sufficient to open new roads if more humanitarian assistance isn\u2019t going through those roads.\u201d You can read more here: Here are the latest images coming out of Jabalia, northern Gaza, which has been the epicentre of a renewed assault by the Israeli military in recent weeks. As we reported in an earlier post, 13 children were among 33 civilians who officials say were killed early this morning by an Israeli airstrike that targeted a densely populated home in Jabalia: Israeli forces detained at least 10 Palestinians across the occupied West Bank overnight, the Palestinian Authority\u2019s Commission for Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs and the Palestinian Prisoners\u2019 Society said. According to Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, the detentions were carried out in numerous areas in the occupied West Bank, including the cities of Jenin, Bethlehem, Ramallah, Tubas, and Jerusalem. Israeli forces destroyed property and made threats against detainees \u2013 which included former detainees who had already spent time in Israeli prisons \u2013 and their families while conducting \u201cviolent raids on homes\u201d, Wafa reports. Some Israeli troops were reported to have ransacked homes and destroyed personal belongings. It is estimated that at least 11,600 Palestinians have been arrested in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since last October. Human rights groups and international organisations have alleged widespread abuse of inmates detained by Israel in raids in the West Bank. They have described alleged abusive and humiliating treatment, including holding blindfolded and handcuffed detainees in cramped cages as well as beatings, intimidation and harassment. The general chief of staff of Saudi Arabia\u2019s armed forces, Fayyad al-Ruwaili, will visit Tehran later today to meet with his Iranian counterpart and discuss defence ties, according to reports. Reuters has the following report: Saudi Arabia has not established ties with Israel, but Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner has discussed the possibility with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman multiple times over the last years, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Iran\u2019s state media said al-Ruwaili will head a high-level Saudi military delegation in Tehran, meet armed forces chief of staff major general Mohammad Bagheri, and discuss bilateral and defence ties. State media added that Bagheri held a phone call with Saudi Arabia\u2019s defence minister Prince Khalid bin Salman Al Saud last year to discuss regional developments and improve defence cooperation between the two countries. Tehran and Riyadh agreed in March 2023, via Chinese intermediation, to re-establish relations after seven years of hostility that had threatened stability and security in the Gulf and helped to fuel conflicts in the Middle East from Yemen to Syria. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry says an Israeli airstrike in the northern Lebanese village of Almat, north of Beirut, has killed at least 20 people. \u201cThe Israeli enemy strike on Almat in the Jbeil district killed 20 people including three children and injuring six, in an updated toll,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. The Shiite Muslim majority village of Almat is located in a mostly Christian region. It is outside Hezbollah\u2019s traditional strongholds of south Beirut and south and east Lebanon which Israel has heavily bombed since it launched its assault on the country late in September. In a video post shared on X, the Palestine Red Crescent Society has said its teams transported 14 people injured by an Israeli airstrike on a tent near al-Qarara port, south of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. At least 43,603 Palestinian people have been killed and 102,929 injured in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Sunday. Of those, 51 Palestinians were killed and 164 injured in the latest 24-hour reporting period, the ministry said. Gaza\u2019s health ministry has said in the past that thousands of other dead people are most likely lost in the rubble of the territory.. Lebanese official media has reported an Israeli airstrike on a house in the main eastern city of Baalbek on Sunday (see post at 09.05), which was not preceded by an Israeli army evacuation warning. \u201cEnemy aircraft launched a strike on a house in the Al-Laqees neighbourhood\u201d of the city, the state-run National News Agency (NNA) said. Earlier, NNA had reported a rare Israeli airstrike north of the Lebanese capital, Beirut, on the Shiite-majority village of Almat, which is located in a mostly Christian region. The Qatari government has informed the US and Israel it will stop mediation efforts to halt the conflict in Gaza because it no longer thinks the parties are negotiating in good faith. The Gulf state has concluded that talks have become a political football, and its efforts to facilitate them were generating criticism towards it, according to a diplomatic source briefed on the situation. \u201cAs long as there is a refusal to negotiate a deal in good faith, they cannot continue to mediate,\u201d the source said. Qatar\u2019s move is the latest major blow to a faltering effort to end fighting in Gaza which has not produced significant results since a temporary ceasefire and hostage release deal nearly a year ago. But with a new US administration taking power in just over two months, the Qataris have also made clear to US contacts that they would be willing to resume mediation if both sides showed a \u201csincere willingness\u201d to reach a deal. Qatar informed Israel, Hamas officials, the US and Egypt of the decision after a US delegation including the CIA director, Bill Burns, visited Doha for inconclusive meetings in late October. You can read the full story by my colleagues, Emma Graham-Harrison and Jason Burke, here: The Israeli military has reportedly attacked in several locations in Lebanon\u2019s north-eastern Bekaa Valley, including in the city of Baalbak and in the Saraain area. In the opening summary, we mentioned reports of over 30 people being killed in an Israeli airstrike on Jabalia this morning. In another deadly airstrike, on the Sabra neighbourhood of Gaza City, five people were killed, with others still missing in the aftermath, Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency said. \u201cA number of civilians are still under the rubble,\u201d the agency said. Contacted by Agence France-Presse (AFP), the Israeli military said it was \u201clooking into the reports\u201d of the airstrikes. A renewed Israeli assault was launched on the northern part of the Gaza Strip last month, with the Israeli military claiming it was to stop Hamas fighters regrouping there. The blockage of aid and food deliveries and the targeting of civilian infrastructure, however, have led to accusations that Israel is committing the war crime of seeking to forcibly displace the remaining population. The entirety of northern Gaza is under Israeli evacuation orders but it is unclear how many people remain. Last month, the UN estimated there were about 400,000 civilians unable or unwilling to follow Israeli evacuation orders to the south. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of Israel\u2019s wars on Gaza and Lebanon. US warplanes staged multiple airstrikes Saturday night on advanced weapons storage facilities in Yemen belonging to the Houthi militant group, the Pentagon has said. The facilities contained various weapons used to target military and civilian vessels navigating international waters throughout the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, according to information provided to AFP by the Pentagon. The Houthi-run Al Masirah television network reported three American and British raids that targeted the capital Sana\u2019a\u2019s southern Al Sabeen district. Elsewhere, Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, reports that 13 children were among 33 civilians who were killed early this morning by an Israeli airstrike that targeted a densely populated home in Jabalia, northern Gaza. The area in northern Gaza has been under a total Israeli siege for weeks and the UN has described conditions there as \u201capocalyptic\u201d. According to Wafa, a significant number of people injured in the Israeli attack have been transferred to the al-Ahli Baptist hospital for urgent medical care. Al Jazeera reporter Anas al-Sharif posted a report from the scene of Sunday\u2019s pre-dawn strike on X, saying that the massacre was one of the biggest so far in Jabalia and that the victims were mostly women and children. It was not possible to independently verify the report as Israel does not allow foreign journalists into Gaza. Israel claimed in a post on X that it had \u201celiminated dozens of terrorists and destroyed terrorist infrastructures and a warehouse of weapons\u201d in Jabalia, without providing any evidence. More on those developments soon. In other news: At least 40 people were killed in strikes across Gaza late on Friday and into Saturday, including two journalist siblings, Ahmad Abu Sakhil and Zahra Abu Sakhil, who were killed together with their father, Muhammad, and three others when Israeli warplanes bombed a school sheltering displaced people in Gaza City, Al Jazeera reported. Gaza\u2019s media office said their deaths raised the number of journalists killed by Israeli attacks to 188 since 7 October 2023. A day earlier, the local radio journalist Khaled Abu Zir was killed, according to Palestinian media reports. Others killed in Israeli attacks included two Palestinians who had been sheltering in the grounds of al-Aqsa hospital in Deir el-Balah and three men who had been released from Israeli detention moments before, Al Jazeera and Palestinian media reported, as well as children who were reportedly targeted by an Israeli airstrike as they tried to collect water in Jabalia, northern Gaza. In Lebanon five siblings, three of whom were deaf and mute, were among at least 40 people killed by Israeli strikes late on Friday and on Saturday, local authorities and media reported. Youssef Jundi, a local resident, told the Associated Press that his longtime neighbour and friend, Ghazwa Dabouk, was among the seven people killed in an Israeli strike on the port city of Tyre late on Friday. Dabouk\u2019s sisters Elissar, Rabab and Fidaa, who were deaf and mute, were also killed in the airstrike, together with Dabouk\u2019s brother Ali, who had autism.

Netanyahu\u2019s newly reinforced position could lead to further intensification of Israel\u2019s assault on Lebanon, and prolong its war in Gaza, critics fear \u2013 although the incoming US president Donald Trump has said he wants to swiftly end both wars.",

Liverpool manager Matt Beard tells BBC Sport: \u201cThere are positives to take but obviously we have to cut out the little errors that led to their goals. Second half we posed a lot of threat, pressed them well and caused them problems. We started the game brightly as well. \u201cThe biggest thing is that you don\u2019t get many chances against the top, top sides and you need to get your shots off. Smithy and Kiernan twice had chances in the first half where they tried to cut inside when they could have hit it earlier. \u201cChelsea are a top, top side, and if you give them opportunities like we did today then you are going to get punished.\u201d Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor tells BBC Sport: \u201cI\u2019m really happy with the performance. We\u2019re keeping our good dynamic at the moment. We started a little bit slower than usual, but if you look at all the picture we controlled the game and were efficient in the right moments. \u201cEvery game is important, every game is three points. For the players we are back to a rhythm where we are at three games a week.\u201d Don\u2019t forget to subscribe to Moving the Goalposts, our FREE women\u2019s football newsletter. You\u2019ll receive weekly updates, exclusive interviews, columns, features and more straight to your inbox! Chelsea defender Millie Bright tells BBC Sport: \u201cIt\u2019s massive. When you come to a stadium and you don\u2019t get that win over the years it\u2019s in the back of your mind. It eats away at you. But our mentality is to win every single game. A good performance and a good win. \u201cWe\u2019re just loving being out on the pitch, we\u2019ve got a great confidence. We\u2019ve been more confident in possession, being brave. You can see that from the girls\u2019 performance. \u201cThe amount of changes that we\u2019ve had in our environment has been a lot. But the transition has been seamless. It shows the people we have, the culture we have created. Everyone is just thriving in this environment.\u201d Here\u2019s Tom Garry\u2019s match report from St Helens\u2026 Sonia Bompastor has become the first WSL manager to win each of their first four away games. It\u2019s three goals and another three points for Chelsea. Six games, six wins. The perfect start continues! 90+2 min: Sonia Bompastor makes her final change of the match, with Oriane Jean-Fran\u00e7ois replacing Reiten. Four minutes have been added on, two left to play. 90+1 min: Ram\u00edrez makes a powerful run down the left before squaring the ball across to Kaptein in the box. The midfielder goes for goal but scuffs her shot. However, it falls straight to the feet of Beever-Jones who scores with a tap-in from just a few yards out. Super-sub Beever-Jones makes it three! 88 min: Hinds shoves Ram\u00edrez off the pitch as Chelsea look to break forward, leaving Sonia Bompastor furious! The striker wipes out the fourth official, but the referee gives nothing. 86 min: N\u00fcsken is shown a yellow card for a tug on Holland and Liverpool have a free kick just in front of the halfway line. 83 min: Another substitution \u2013 for Liverpool this time. H\u00f6binger is replaced by Cornelia Kapocs with around seven minutes left to play. 80 min: A double change for Chelsea now as Hamano is replaced by Catarina Macario and Cuthbert makes way for Wieke Kaptein. 77 min: Liverpool\u2019s momentum has faded in the last 10 minutes or so. They haven\u2019t really tested Hampton too much and Chelsea look comfortable as we approach the final stages of the match. Here\u2019s Tom Garry\u2019s take on the attendance at St Helens Stadium this afternoon\u2026 73 min: Cuthbert is booked for a challenge on Enderby and Liverpool have a free kick in midfield. 72 min: Liverpool make a double change, with Yana Dani\u00ebls replacing Fisk and Hannah Silcock on for Matthews. 71 min: Cuthbert fires a powerful strike towards goal and forces a strong save from Laws, but nothing comes of the resulting corner. 68 min: Another substitution \u2013 this time for Chelsea. Kaneryd is replaced by Aggie Beever-Jones, who looks to have moved out onto the right. 66 min: First substitution for Liverpool as Kiernan is replaced by Mia Enderby. The hosts need the fresh legs in attack as they look to play direct in a desperate attempt to get back into this game. 63 min: Liverpool have been piling on the pressure in the last 13 minutes. H\u00f6binger receives the ball in midfield and looks to play forward but is caught out by N\u00fcsken. Chelsea instantly turn possession around and can make the most of the gaps left in Liverpool\u2019s defence. Hamano eventually finds herself in front of goal but can\u2019t make the most of her chance. 60 min: Liverpool have a free kick following a foul on H\u00f6binger from Ram\u00edrez. H\u00f6binger sends the ball into the box and Bright heads it clear, but it falls to Hinds. The wing-back goes for goal and forces a save from Hampton. 56 min: Holland wins the ball from N\u00fcsken in midfield and plays it through to Kiernan, who is marginally offside. Much better from Liverpool. The hosts have looked the more threatening of the two teams so far in this second half. 55 min: Fisk attempts to play Smith through the middle, but Buchanan puts a stop to the attack with ease. 52 min: Liverpool are attacking in numbers as they look to get back into the match, but Chelsea still look fairly comfortable. 49 min: Liverpool have a free kick on the right following a challenge on Kiernan from Bright. H\u00f6binger sends it into the box, but Chelsea can clear the threat. 47 min: A positive start to this second half from Liverpool. The hosts work their way into the box as Kiernan sets the ball to Hinds. The wing-back goes for goal but fires her effort over the crossbar. Chelsea get us under way for the second half. The visitors made one change at the break with Ashley Lawrence replacing Bronze, who appeared to pick up a knock just before half-time. While we wait for the second half, don\u2019t forget to subscribe to Moving the Goalposts. Our women\u2019s football newsletter \u2013 which includes all the latest talking points \u2013 will land in your inbox every week. Chelsea\u2019s patience certainly paid off towards the end of that first half. Liverpool started well and looked threatening in attack for much of the opening 20 minutes, but two goals in quick succession have proved to be a huge blow. 45 min: Smith is booked for a challenge on Bronze and Chelsea have a free kick. Three minutes have been added on to the end of this half. 42 min: Laws attempts to play the ball out from the back but passes it straight to Reiten, who makes no mistake in taking advantage of the empty net with a composed effort. A real sucker punch for Liverpool \u2013 a huge mistake from Laws gifts Chelsea a two-goal lead! 38 min: Kaneryd goes for goal but her effort rattles the crossbar and bounces out to Reiten. The midfielder then has her own attempt at the target, but Bonner makes the block. Unfortunately for the defender, the ball deflects straight to the feet of Ram\u00edrez, who simply taps her shot into the net. A valiant effort from Liverpool, but there\u2019s no stopping the Chelsea striker in that position. Ram\u00edrez breaks the deadlock for the visitors! 34 min: Reiten steps up to take the free kick and fires a cross into the box. Bronze makes an attempt to go for goal, but Holland gets in front to head the ball behind for a corner. Nothing comes of the subsequent set-piece. 33 min: Evans is booked for a clumsy challenge on Kaneryd and Chelsea have a free kick in a dangerous position. 31 min: What a save! Reiten sends a low-driven cross straight into the danger zone. Kaneryd is there at the back post and goes for goal with her first touch, but Laws makes it across to make the save. 29 min: Another Liverpool free kick is wasted as H\u00f6binger\u2019s cross flies straight into the hands of Hampton. 26 min: The hosts break forward and Holland sends a cross in from the left. Fisk goes for goal at the back post but Baltimore gets just in front to make the clearance. 25 min: Chelsea have a corner. The ball is sent straight into the box and N\u00fcsken goes for a header, but Kiernan deflects it away. Fisk eventually makes the final clearance and Liverpool go on the attack. 22 min: Liverpool waste a free kick on the right as Baltimore fires the ball away from danger following a poor pass into the box. 19 min: These two teams have approached this match with two different styles of play. Liverpool have been looking to play direct to Smith and Kiernan in attack, while Chelsea have been patient by going through the middle at every opportunity. It\u2019s been an interesting game so far \u2013 we just need some goals now! 17 min: Another chance for the visitors as Baltimore receives the ball on the left and fires a shot directly at Laws, who can parry it away. 15 min: Chelsea look to play forward again as the ball falls to Reiten just outside the box, who looks to make a cross, but Bonner is there to clear the danger again. 12 min: A fantastic pass is sent over the Chelsea defence and through to Kiernan. The forward looks to make a run towards goal but she is forced out wide by Bright and the visitors can nullify the attack. 9 min: Another chance for the visitors as Reiten sends a curling cross in from the right. It runs all the way through to the back post and almost sneaks into the net, but Bonner can make the clearance. 8 min: The ball is sent out wide to Kaneryd on the right, who plays it short to Hamano in the middle. The forward goes for goal but her effort is saved by Laws. 6 min: What a start! Both teams have had a glimpse at goal in the opening five minutes. Surely it\u2019s only a matter of time before the deadlock is broken\u2026 3 min: Chelsea\u2019s clearance goes straight through to Ram\u00edrez, who looks to attack the Liverpool net, but Bonner does enough to block her effort. 2 min: Liverpool have a corner and the ball is sent straight into the box. It falls to the feet of Hinds, who goes for goal, but her effort is blocked and it runs out for another corner. The second set piece, however, is cleared by Chelsea. 1 min: Smith makes a run down the right and into the Chelsea penalty area. She goes to square the ball across goal, but Buchanan deflects it behind for a corner. We\u2019re under way at St Helens Stadium! The teams are out at St Helens Stadium. A period of silence will be observed before kick-off to mark Remembrance Sunday. Ahead of this afternoon\u2019s huge clash with Liverpool, Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor said: \u201cI know Liverpool always find a way to perform against Chelsea. We are prepared for that. From Liverpool\u2019s performances and results from the beginning of the season, I\u2019m expecting a team who is really organised. \u201cThey don\u2019t concede a lot of goals. They will be ready to face us on Sunday, and we will also be focusing on ourselves with the quality of talent in my squad.\u201d In-form Chelsea forward Johanna Rytting Kaneryd spoke to Suzanne Wrack ahead of today\u2019s match about the season so far and her ultimate \u201cnightmare\u201d \u2013 the idea of becoming a predictable player. Liverpool manager Matt Beard has insisted his team will be playing to win this afternoon. In his programme notes ahead of the match, he wrote: \u201cChelsea have had a fine start to the season and Sonia Bompastor has come in and done a good job because it was always going to be tough for whoever replaced Emma Hayes. \u201cIf you look at the two squads that Manchester City and Chelsea have, they\u2019ve probably got two XIs that could play and compete for the top three in the WSL.

It\u2019s a game that we\u2019re looking forward to and it\u2019s another opportunity to test ourselves.\u201d This weekend in the WSL Arsenal stormed to their biggest WSL victory of the season on Friday with a 5-0 win over Brighton. Meanwhile, Khadija Shaw scored a hat-trick as Manchester City cruised to a 4-0 win over Tottenham at the Etihad Stadium.

      "bodyText": "The Valencian regional government, which has been heavily criticised over its response to the deadly floods that have killed at least 222 people in Spain, has ruled out any imminent resignations over the matter, arguing that the departure of senior leaders would constitute a betrayal of the victims of the disaster. Growing public anger over the authorities\u2019 handling of the emergency brought 130,000 people on to the streets of the city of Valencia on Saturday night to call for the resignation of the regional president, Carlos Maz\u00f3n. Maz\u00f3n, a member of the conservative People\u2019s party (PP), is under mounting pressure after it emerged he had a three-hour lunch with a journalist on Tuesday 29 October, the day the torrential rains hit the region, and did not arrive at the emergency command centre until 7.30 that evening. There are unanswered questions about why, despite a series of red weather alerts from the state meteorological office, his administration waited almost 14 hours before sending emergency civil protection messages to people\u2019s mobile phones. On Sunday morning the region\u2019s vice-president, Susana Camarero, was emphatic that no one would be stepping down as Spain faced its biggest crisis in recent memory. \u201cGiven the magnitude of the catastrophe and the damages inflicted on towns and on people, given that magnitude and all the damages caused, we cannot abandon the victims,\u201d she said. \u201cThis government won\u2019t abandon the victims.

Maz\u00f3n\u2019s colleagues in the national PP have defended his actions and claimed he is assuming full responsibility. They accuse the central government of refusing to take charge of the crisis. Spanish government sources insist they have done everything they can, having sent more than 18,000 soldiers and police officers to the region. They point out that Maz\u00f3n has full command and control over the relief effort because the crisis remains a level 2 emergency and so a matter for the regional authorities. Were the Valencian government to say it could not cope with the situation, a level 3 emergency could be declared, transferring command to the central government. Although the central government has stopped short of calling for Maz\u00f3n\u2019s resignation, describing the matter as \u201ca debate for when the time is right\u201d, it has said the facts speak for themselves.

We have a trans child, a female child, a disabled child, mixed-race grandchildren, all of whom are hated by the Maga party.

We met through a mutual friend at her church, and got along instantly. I love her to death. We celebrated Halloween and dressed up as ghosts.</p> <p>I secretly voted for Kamala Harris. I told my girlfriend that I wasn\u2019t voting, and she doesn\u2019t doubt it. She once said that Trump is America\u2019s last hope, and that he is God\u2019s chosen candidate. It was horrifying. I was internally screaming \u201cWTF\u201d. She has also said that the allegations against him are all lies; part of a \u201csecret plot\u201d to destroy him. But I wasn\u2019t ready to talk about it. I feel dishonest. I hate lying, but it\u2019s for the best. I\u2019d hate to see her go insane over my vote, but I know she would. Not only that, but her father would disapprove of our relationship if he knew. He would disapprove of her just for dating me. I can\u2019t risk that, ever. <strong>Anonymous, </strong><strong>computer science student, 22,</strong><strong> Joplin, MO</strong></p> <h2>\u2018He calls me stupid\u2019</h2> <p>It has been hell since the moment Trump announced his candidacy. Hubby, who voted for Clinton and Obama (he says he now regrets doing that), is brainwashed Maga to the core and watches Fox incessantly. It was affecting my physical and emotional health. He uses abusive language, calls me stupid when I explain my main concerns are education, health, climate change, moral standards and so on. He is an old man who has felt disenfranchised and diminished by social change.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The evil spewed by Trump has made our life bizarre. But at this point, I\u2019m in it for the long haul</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I met him in a club on a girls\u2019 night, and we\u2019ve been married for 37 years. No children, but he has a daughter and two granddaughters from a previous marriage who I have a great relationship with. And we have a cat! The evil spewed by Trump has made our life bizarre. But at this point, I\u2019m in it for the long haul. <strong>Anonymous, retired educator and scientist </strong><strong>, Florida</strong></p> <h2>\u2018We will still have sex tonight\u2019</h2> <p>It is election night as I write this. I\u2019m sitting in the nursery holding our five-month old baby while he naps. My conservative husband is downstairs with our six-year old, probably listening to live election coverage that leans far right in perspective. He asked me how I was feeling today and I said fine. I know when I\u2019m on my deathbed, I will not be thinking about Donald Trump, I\u2019ll be thinking of my family. I\u2019ll be thinking of my husband who yes, voted for Trump not once but three times but is also smart (yes, very smart), and my favorite person in the world. Now that the poll results are pouring in, I feel upset that my husband can support a misogynistic, racist and manipulative candidate. I also heard my husband\u2019s concerns about another four years of a liberal leadership, and he is not wrong. He is just less right. And we will still have sex tonight. <strong>Susie, 39, from Colorado</strong></p> <h2>\u2018My wife expects Trump to stop funding mass slaughter\u2019</h2> <p>I voted for Jill Stein. Almost every Democrat we met voted for Jill Stein because she opposes what is happening in the Ukraine and Gaza (and the West Bank), especially Gaza. My wife voted for Donald Trump because she doesn\u2019t believe a word he actually says and she expects him to stop funding mass slaughter. We think similarly about politics, but my wife doesn\u2019t want the Democrats in power because they are warmongers, whereas I will not vote for anyone who endorses a genocide or an unjust war. Voting differently hasn\u2019t affected our relationship in the least. <strong>Anonymous, artist, 69, </strong><strong> Tucson, Arizona</strong></p>    <h2>\u2018I wrote in Jesus Christ, my husband voted Trump\u2019</h2> <p>I couldn\u2019t vote for Harris because she is pro-abortion, and strong on that. Although I am strongly pro-life, I do think laws need to be refined to protect women who are miscarrying and to protect the life of the mother. I could not vote for Trump because he is mentally ill and unstable. I think he has turned the immigration issue into racism. My biggest issues are to protect and support Israel, to find a humane way to screen immigrants and help true asylum seekers, while protecting our country from real criminals, not illegals. So I wrote in Jesus Christ. My husband voted Trump. We<strong> </strong>can agree to disagree. We both have freedom to vote our conscience. <strong>Anonymous, retired RN and homeschool teacher, 58, </strong><strong> Kingston, Tennessee</strong></p> <h2>\u2018Our love is more important than our disagreements\u2019</h2> <p>My wife and I have been together since 2019, married in 2022. I voted for Harris, she didn\u2019t. It\u2019s been a strain on our relationship and we have developed policies \u2013 such as when it gets too heated, either of us can say \u201cpeace out\u201d \u2013 and we are working on listening thoroughly to each other. The election won\u2019t affect our relationship. We\u2019ve agreed on that! Our love is more important than our disagreements. <strong>Ross R Mason, 62, vice-president at EarthX Media Inc, </strong><strong> Dallas, Texas</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I don\u2019t feel like my best self when I have to defend my values to my spouse\u2019</h2> <p>I really don\u2019t understand how my husband can like Trump. We used to make fun of him when he was on The Apprentice. He is a smart man, and he believes these buffoons. I voted for Harris. I support women\u2019s reproductive rights, and that was one of the most important issues for me. I also feel that she is sane and not divisive. My husband and I agreed when Harris got on the ticket that we would not discuss politics. If we do, it sours our relationship. It has worked for the most part. I don\u2019t feel like my best self when I have to defend my values to my spouse. <strong>Anonymous, librarian, 47, from Oregon</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I love his determination to do his best\u2019</h2> <p>About 27 years ago, I met my husband on a blind date. Two years later, we married. He voted for Trump, I voted for Harris. It\u2019s not a secret; my husband knows what\u2019s important to me. I\u2019m extremely aggravated by his preference for Fox News, which I see as a successful propaganda machine. However, while I don\u2019t care for his political perspectives and practices, I love his intellectual capacity, his sense of humor and his determination to do his best. <strong>Anonymous, retired educator, 78, from Tucson, Arizona</strong></p>    <h2>\u2018He chose a misogynistic racist over me\u2019</h2> <p>We\u2019ve been married 40 too many years and basically canceled each other\u2019s votes. I\u2019ve been involved in politics since my 20s and consider myself as a liberal. There have been many arguments since my husband started to espouse Trump gaslighting. I hate the fact that he would choose a misogynistic racist over me, a woman. Abortion and immigration issues mattered to me this election. Most of our relatives came to the US as illegals and now this immigration rhetoric comes up? We both agreed not to discuss politics, though. We\u2019ll keep on keeping on. <strong>Rebeca Guevara, 76, retired nurse from Laredo, Texas</strong></p> <h2>\u2018This makes me question the relationship\u2019</h2> <p>My partner knows who I voted for, but we just don\u2019t talk about politics. I\u2019d love to be able to have a discussion with him about the issues, but he usually changes the subject. While I consider myself a moderate (I\u2019d vote for someone like Mitt Romney if he was the Republican candidate), he gets most of his political insights from Fox News. He sees Trump as strong and believes that he\u2019d be worse off financially if Harris had won (he and I are both in a good position financially, but we\u2019re not nearly rich enough to be better off under Trump).</p> <p>We met online almost two years ago and are in a committed relationship, but we both have kids from previous marriages and are not planning to live together anytime soon. The fact we can\u2019t even have a discussion about the election makes me question the relationship. <strong>Anonymous, 51,</strong><strong> Columbus, Ohio, with a management position in engineering</strong></p> <p><em>Responses have been edited for clarity. </em></p> <p><strong>Read more of the Guardian\u2019s 2024 US election coverage</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/08/young-men-donald-trump-kamala-harris\">A masculinity researcher on the Democrats\u2019 \u2018fatal miscalculation\u2019</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/07/election-deniers-trump-victory-senate-races\">Election deniers use Trump victory to sow more doubt over 2020 result</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/08/what-a-second-trump-presidency-means-for-big-us-tech-firms\">What a second Trump presidency means for big US tech firms</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/pompeo-kennedy-and-musk-who-could-be-in-trumps-new-administration\">Who could be in Trump\u2019s new administration</a></p></li> </ul>",

We met through a mutual friend at her church, and got along instantly. I love her to death. We celebrated Halloween and dressed up as ghosts. I secretly voted for Kamala Harris. I told my girlfriend that I wasn\u2019t voting, and she doesn\u2019t doubt it. She once said that Trump is America\u2019s last hope, and that he is God\u2019s chosen candidate. It was horrifying. I was internally screaming \u201cWTF\u201d. She has also said that the allegations against him are all lies; part of a \u201csecret plot\u201d to destroy him. But I wasn\u2019t ready to talk about it. I feel dishonest. I hate lying, but it\u2019s for the best. I\u2019d hate to see her go insane over my vote, but I know she would. Not only that, but her father would disapprove of our relationship if he knew. He would disapprove of her just for dating me. I can\u2019t risk that, ever. Anonymous, computer science student, 22, Joplin, MO \u2018He calls me stupid\u2019 It has been hell since the moment Trump announced his candidacy. Hubby, who voted for Clinton and Obama (he says he now regrets doing that), is brainwashed Maga to the core and watches Fox incessantly. It was affecting my physical and emotional health. He uses abusive language, calls me stupid when I explain my main concerns are education, health, climate change, moral standards and so on. He is an old man who has felt disenfranchised and diminished by social change. I met him in a club on a girls\u2019 night, and we\u2019ve been married for 37 years. No children, but he has a daughter and two granddaughters from a previous marriage who I have a great relationship with. And we have a cat! The evil spewed by Trump has made our life bizarre. But at this point, I\u2019m in it for the long haul. Anonymous, retired educator and scientist , Florida \u2018We will still have sex tonight\u2019 It is election night as I write this. I\u2019m sitting in the nursery holding our five-month old baby while he naps. My conservative husband is downstairs with our six-year old, probably listening to live election coverage that leans far right in perspective. He asked me how I was feeling today and I said fine. I know when I\u2019m on my deathbed, I will not be thinking about Donald Trump, I\u2019ll be thinking of my family. I\u2019ll be thinking of my husband who yes, voted for Trump not once but three times but is also smart (yes, very smart), and my favorite person in the world. Now that the poll results are pouring in, I feel upset that my husband can support a misogynistic, racist and manipulative candidate. I also heard my husband\u2019s concerns about another four years of a liberal leadership, and he is not wrong. He is just less right. And we will still have sex tonight. Susie, 39, from Colorado \u2018My wife expects Trump to stop funding mass slaughter\u2019 I voted for Jill Stein. Almost every Democrat we met voted for Jill Stein because she opposes what is happening in the Ukraine and Gaza (and the West Bank), especially Gaza. My wife voted for Donald Trump because she doesn\u2019t believe a word he actually says and she expects him to stop funding mass slaughter. We think similarly about politics, but my wife doesn\u2019t want the Democrats in power because they are warmongers, whereas I will not vote for anyone who endorses a genocide or an unjust war. Voting differently hasn\u2019t affected our relationship in the least. Anonymous, artist, 69, Tucson, Arizona \u2018I wrote in Jesus Christ, my husband voted Trump\u2019 I couldn\u2019t vote for Harris because she is pro-abortion, and strong on that. Although I am strongly pro-life, I do think laws need to be refined to protect women who are miscarrying and to protect the life of the mother. I could not vote for Trump because he is mentally ill and unstable. I think he has turned the immigration issue into racism. My biggest issues are to protect and support Israel, to find a humane way to screen immigrants and help true asylum seekers, while protecting our country from real criminals, not illegals. So I wrote in Jesus Christ. My husband voted Trump. We can agree to disagree. We both have freedom to vote our conscience. Anonymous, retired RN and homeschool teacher, 58, Kingston, Tennessee \u2018Our love is more important than our disagreements\u2019 My wife and I have been together since 2019, married in 2022. I voted for Harris, she didn\u2019t. It\u2019s been a strain on our relationship and we have developed policies \u2013 such as when it gets too heated, either of us can say \u201cpeace out\u201d \u2013 and we are working on listening thoroughly to each other. The election won\u2019t affect our relationship. We\u2019ve agreed on that! Our love is more important than our disagreements. Ross R Mason, 62, vice-president at EarthX Media Inc, Dallas, Texas \u2018I don\u2019t feel like my best self when I have to defend my values to my spouse\u2019 I really don\u2019t understand how my husband can like Trump. We used to make fun of him when he was on The Apprentice. He is a smart man, and he believes these buffoons. I voted for Harris. I support women\u2019s reproductive rights, and that was one of the most important issues for me. I also feel that she is sane and not divisive. My husband and I agreed when Harris got on the ticket that we would not discuss politics. If we do, it sours our relationship. It has worked for the most part. I don\u2019t feel like my best self when I have to defend my values to my spouse. Anonymous, librarian, 47, from Oregon \u2018I love his determination to do his best\u2019 About 27 years ago, I met my husband on a blind date. Two years later, we married. He voted for Trump, I voted for Harris. It\u2019s not a secret; my husband knows what\u2019s important to me. I\u2019m extremely aggravated by his preference for Fox News, which I see as a successful propaganda machine. However, while I don\u2019t care for his political perspectives and practices, I love his intellectual capacity, his sense of humor and his determination to do his best. Anonymous, retired educator, 78, from Tucson, Arizona \u2018He chose a misogynistic racist over me\u2019 We\u2019ve been married 40 too many years and basically canceled each other\u2019s votes. I\u2019ve been involved in politics since my 20s and consider myself as a liberal. There have been many arguments since my husband started to espouse Trump gaslighting. I hate the fact that he would choose a misogynistic racist over me, a woman. Abortion and immigration issues mattered to me this election. Most of our relatives came to the US as illegals and now this immigration rhetoric comes up? We both agreed not to discuss politics, though. We\u2019ll keep on keeping on. Rebeca Guevara, 76, retired nurse from Laredo, Texas \u2018This makes me question the relationship\u2019 My partner knows who I voted for, but we just don\u2019t talk about politics. I\u2019d love to be able to have a discussion with him about the issues, but he usually changes the subject. While I consider myself a moderate (I\u2019d vote for someone like Mitt Romney if he was the Republican candidate), he gets most of his political insights from Fox News. He sees Trump as strong and believes that he\u2019d be worse off financially if Harris had won (he and I are both in a good position financially, but we\u2019re not nearly rich enough to be better off under Trump). We met online almost two years ago and are in a committed relationship, but we both have kids from previous marriages and are not planning to live together anytime soon. The fact we can\u2019t even have a discussion about the election makes me question the relationship.

At a recent campaign rally, Trump also said that given where the press was located at the event, if someone were to try to assassinate him, the person \u201cwould have to shoot through the fake news, and I don\u2019t mind that so much\u201d. Kash Patel, who could be appointed as acting attorney general or head of the CIA, frequently talks of the \u201cdeep state\u201d and told the far-right Trump ally Steve Bannon in a podcast interview: \u201cWe will go out and find the conspirators, not just in government but in the media \u2026 We\u2019re going to come after you.\u201d Trevor Timm, executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said it was \u201centirely possible that [Trump] is just bloviating\u201d.

As to cracking down on whistleblowers and journalists, Trump could use the Espionage Act, which allows the government to pursue people who share information with journalists related to national security, Kitrosser said. Barack Obama was also aggressive in his use of the law to prosecute whistleblowers during his presidency. Kitrosser said she was \u201cvery, very disturbed\u201d by Obama\u2019s crackdown on media sources. But the difference between the Obama administration\u2019s effort and Trump\u2019s call for prosecuting journalists and sources who leak information is that Trump has repeatedly said: \u201cHe does not think that criticism of him, criticism of judges that he appoints, criticism of his policies \u2026 should be protected,\u201d Kitrosser said. \u201cNot to protect national security, but to protect himself, and I think that is really the fundamental difference between Obama and Trump.\u201d The Trump administration will probably have an easier time pursuing sources than journalists. \u201cI think courts will be more receptive to the argument that the first amendment bars media prosecutions of journalists under the Espionage Act than they have been receptive to those claims by media sources,\u201d Kitrosser said. To protect sources, journalists could also start to rely more on encryption communication tools like Signal in a second Trump term. The Freedom of the Press Foundation has urged journalists to start using such technology. The organization is also lobbying for the passage of the Press Act, which would prohibit the federal government from compelling journalists to disclose certain protected information, except in limited circumstances such as to prevent terrorism or imminent violence, and from spying on journalists through their technology providers. The House passed the bill unanimously. Three Republican senators have also sponsored the legislation, but it has stalled in committee because of a small group of Republicans, including Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who argued the bill would \u201copen a floodgate of leaks damaging to law enforcement and our nation\u2019s security\u201d. \u201cToo many journalists are little more than leftwing activists who are, at best, ambivalent about America and who are cavalier about our security and the truth,\u201d Cotton wrote in a statement explaining his opposition. Timm, of the Press Foundation, said he was unsure whether the Senate would pass the legislation before Joe Biden leaves office. \u201cThe Democrats in the lame duck session are really going to have to prioritize it because when the Senate changes hands and the White House changes hands, there is probably little to no chance that this bill would pass,\u201d Timm said. \u201cIt\u2019s now or never for protecting journalists\u2019 rights.\u201d",

Spending on eating out flatlined in October, while outlay on digital subscriptions rose by 10%.</p> <p>Darker evenings and colder temperatures may be having an impact, but so too are the conditions that have made it harder for hospitality to thrive.</p> <p>As they stumbled about for a secure footing after the pandemic, rampant inflation had already left pubs and restaurants facing a painful choice: raise prices to protect wafer-thin margins, or accept losses to retain customers, in the hope that conditions will ease.</p> <p>Into that devil\u2019s bargain came the measures introduced by the new chancellor, Rachel Reeves, which industry leaders say mean even higher prices when the bill comes.</p> <p>Increases in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/oct/15/what-are-employer-national-insurance-contributions-rachel-reeves-tax-budget\">employers\u2019 national insurance contributions (NICs)</a>, coupled with a minimum wage rise, mean employing a full-time staff member will cost an extra \u00a32,500 from April, according to UK Hospitality.</p> <p>At the weekend, the leading trade body for the sector upped the pressure on the government by writing a letter to the chancellor \u2013 signed by more than 200 hospitality bosses \u2013 claiming the cost increases would inflict \u201cunprecedented damage\u201d, including small business closures within a year, \u201cdrastic\u201d job cuts and cancelled investment.</p>    <p>The only crumb of comfort for the sector has been a vague promise to lower business rates \u2013 a system that most hospitality leaders think needs a total overhaul \u2013 and even then not until 2026 at the earliest.</p> <p>Tim Martin, the outspoken boss of JD Wetherspoon, has estimated the extra cost to his 800 pubs and 50 hotels at \u00a360m in a year \u2013 a sum large enough to have wiped out most of its profits last year.</p> <p>\u201cThis budget will put a lot of extra pressure on quite a weak sector,\u201d hesaid, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/06/wetherspoons-tim-martin-pub-price-rises-labour-budget\">warning of price rises</a> as a result.</p> <p>Even the proprietor of Lancashire gastropub the Parkers Arms, who, unlike Martin, is a \u201ccommitted socialist\u201d, says the extra cost is going to be hard to manage.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems [Reeves] has taken into account the people who really need some help,\u201d said Stosie Madi. \u201cPeople have to pay for the NHS.</p> <p>\u201cBut she is a bit naive in drastically imposing the taxes on us when we\u2019re still crippled by the government that\u2019s just gone.\u201d</p> <p>Two hours\u2019 drive east, in York, Neil Bentinck, the head chef and owner of Skosh, has recently introduced a new earlier Saturday sitting, using staff who were already going to be on-site anyway.</p> <p>\u201cThat was to increase profits, but the extra revenue will now only balance out the extra cost [of the budget],\u201d he said.</p> <p>Like many in the sector, Bentinck is wary of whining about external conditions.</p> <p>He said there was always clamour for high-quality food, as long as diners feel they are getting their money\u2019s worth, pointing out that Skosh is still fully booked at \u00a370 a head.</p> <p>Bentinck feels some kinship with consumers who are thinking twice before eating out at restaurants that do not pull out all the stops to deliver good value.</p>    <p>\u201cThe kids wanted steak, so we tried this place where we paid \u00a330 for just a piece of meat with half a tomato,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI know that piece of meat costs \u00a33. And then it\u2019s \u00a35 for a bowl of frozen chips. That\u2019s expensive mediocrity and it\u2019s very prevalent.\u201d</p> <p>Chains that were once thought of as a value night out have hiked prices by as much as a quarter to offset inflation in their costs, according to data from Lumina Intelligence, which provides market insight in the food and drink sector.</p> <p>Between the third quarter of 2023 and the summer of 2024, average prices at Bill\u2019s went up by 26%, by 24% at Wagamama, by 19% at Nando\u2019s and by 13% at Pizza Express, it says.</p> <p>In autumn 2022, a single American Hot at Pizza Express cost \u00a313.48 on average, but has risen to \u00a316.75, and will cost \u00a318.25 in London, according to the data.</p> <p>At large chain restaurants, often owned by private equity investors who hunger more for profit than good food, there is always more incentive to squeeze customers than at smaller independent venues that rely heavily on loyalty and their passion for cooking.</p> <p>\u201cIf the investors want X amount of profit, they\u2019re going to be saying you need to charge more,\u201d Bentinck said.</p> <p>But even restaurants that have not raised their prices, while offering gastronomic excellence, are being hit.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a robust hearty menu for \u00a350. It\u2019s the same price we\u2019ve had for two years and haven\u2019t been able to put it up,\u201d said Madi.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people who would normally go for the three courses are going for the walk-in menu and spending \u00a325 instead.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019d have had a cocktail pre-dinner, maybe a dessert wine with pudding. Now they don\u2019t do that. People are watching the pennies out there.\u201d</p> <p>Figures from the hospitality industry consultancy CGA by NIQ back that up. A third of consumers say they are choosing cheaper food options, while 41% are cutting back on drinks.

      "bodyText": "Nothing tarnishes an evening out quite like a row over the size of the bill. But leading figures in the hospitality sector fear Labour\u2019s first budget in 14 years has put them on a collision course with their guests over the fair price of a meal. Neither side has much room for manoeuvre. Despite easing inflation, prices are still rising and consumers still bear the scars of a cost of living crisis that has eroded disposable income. Few will accept what one restaurateur called \u201cexpensive mediocrity\u201d from chains that have relatively little to offer the discerning gourmand but have jacked up their prices to levels that suggest they do. Figures from Barclays show that people are opting for Netflix over nocellara olives. Spending on eating out flatlined in October, while outlay on digital subscriptions rose by 10%. Darker evenings and colder temperatures may be having an impact, but so too are the conditions that have made it harder for hospitality to thrive. As they stumbled about for a secure footing after the pandemic, rampant inflation had already left pubs and restaurants facing a painful choice: raise prices to protect wafer-thin margins, or accept losses to retain customers, in the hope that conditions will ease. Into that devil\u2019s bargain came the measures introduced by the new chancellor, Rachel Reeves, which industry leaders say mean even higher prices when the bill comes. Increases in employers\u2019 national insurance contributions (NICs), coupled with a minimum wage rise, mean employing a full-time staff member will cost an extra \u00a32,500 from April, according to UK Hospitality. At the weekend, the leading trade body for the sector upped the pressure on the government by writing a letter to the chancellor \u2013 signed by more than 200 hospitality bosses \u2013 claiming the cost increases would inflict \u201cunprecedented damage\u201d, including small business closures within a year, \u201cdrastic\u201d job cuts and cancelled investment. The only crumb of comfort for the sector has been a vague promise to lower business rates \u2013 a system that most hospitality leaders think needs a total overhaul \u2013 and even then not until 2026 at the earliest. Tim Martin, the outspoken boss of JD Wetherspoon, has estimated the extra cost to his 800 pubs and 50 hotels at \u00a360m in a year \u2013 a sum large enough to have wiped out most of its profits last year. \u201cThis budget will put a lot of extra pressure on quite a weak sector,\u201d hesaid, after warning of price rises as a result. Even the proprietor of Lancashire gastropub the Parkers Arms, who, unlike Martin, is a \u201ccommitted socialist\u201d, says the extra cost is going to be hard to manage. \u201cIt seems [Reeves] has taken into account the people who really need some help,\u201d said Stosie Madi. \u201cPeople have to pay for the NHS. \u201cBut she is a bit naive in drastically imposing the taxes on us when we\u2019re still crippled by the government that\u2019s just gone.\u201d Two hours\u2019 drive east, in York, Neil Bentinck, the head chef and owner of Skosh, has recently introduced a new earlier Saturday sitting, using staff who were already going to be on-site anyway. \u201cThat was to increase profits, but the extra revenue will now only balance out the extra cost [of the budget],\u201d he said. Like many in the sector, Bentinck is wary of whining about external conditions. He said there was always clamour for high-quality food, as long as diners feel they are getting their money\u2019s worth, pointing out that Skosh is still fully booked at \u00a370 a head. Bentinck feels some kinship with consumers who are thinking twice before eating out at restaurants that do not pull out all the stops to deliver good value. \u201cThe kids wanted steak, so we tried this place where we paid \u00a330 for just a piece of meat with half a tomato,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that piece of meat costs \u00a33. And then it\u2019s \u00a35 for a bowl of frozen chips. That\u2019s expensive mediocrity and it\u2019s very prevalent.\u201d Chains that were once thought of as a value night out have hiked prices by as much as a quarter to offset inflation in their costs, according to data from Lumina Intelligence, which provides market insight in the food and drink sector. Between the third quarter of 2023 and the summer of 2024, average prices at Bill\u2019s went up by 26%, by 24% at Wagamama, by 19% at Nando\u2019s and by 13% at Pizza Express, it says. In autumn 2022, a single American Hot at Pizza Express cost \u00a313.48 on average, but has risen to \u00a316.75, and will cost \u00a318.25 in London, according to the data. At large chain restaurants, often owned by private equity investors who hunger more for profit than good food, there is always more incentive to squeeze customers than at smaller independent venues that rely heavily on loyalty and their passion for cooking. \u201cIf the investors want X amount of profit, they\u2019re going to be saying you need to charge more,\u201d Bentinck said. But even restaurants that have not raised their prices, while offering gastronomic excellence, are being hit. \u201cWe have a robust hearty menu for \u00a350. It\u2019s the same price we\u2019ve had for two years and haven\u2019t been able to put it up,\u201d said Madi. \u201cA lot of people who would normally go for the three courses are going for the walk-in menu and spending \u00a325 instead. \u201cThey\u2019d have had a cocktail pre-dinner, maybe a dessert wine with pudding. Now they don\u2019t do that. People are watching the pennies out there.\u201d Figures from the hospitality industry consultancy CGA by NIQ back that up. A third of consumers say they are choosing cheaper food options, while 41% are cutting back on drinks. The top five reasons that survey respondents cited included the lack of cash in their own pockets or the extra on the bill at the end of the night. On top of the increasing frugality comes far less forgivable behaviour on consumers\u2019 part, with \u201cno-shows\u201d, where diners reserve a table but never show up, at a record high. Unsurprisingly, business leaders caught in the pincer movement of higher costs and more cautious consumers are beginning to lose heart. Only 20% of hospitality bosses are feeling confident about the future of the sector over the next 12 months, according to a survey by CGA by NIQ. That is nearly half the proportion (36%) who felt that way just three months ago. UK Hospitality estimates that the 130,000 venues owned by its members would have to raise prices by up to 8% to cover the extra cost of employing staff as a result of the budget. But with consumers already choosing box set nights in over epicurean nights out, the trade body says businesses simply cannot risk doing that. Instead, they will avoid recruitment, constraining growth in a sector that the trade body says contributes \u00a393bn a year to the economy. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, said the best hope for the industry was a shift in how the nation perceived the economic picture. \u201cIf you can get growth going, if you can get positive consumer sentiment going, that might be something that saves the sector.\u201d But she is concerned that the government may have helped trigger the drop in confidence by getting itself into a \u201cdoom loop\u201d, constantly talking down the economy. \u201cIn July, there was a sense that growth was better, inflation was coming down, interest rates were coming down.

Two classes of creditors, group A bondholders and group B bondholders, are offering high-interest \u00a33bn rescue packages intended as a liquidity lifeline while the company burns through cash and seeks to restructure its debts. Thames is labouring under an unsustainable \u00a315bn debt burden after years of paying hefty dividends as well as fines for pollution scandals. Its shareholders, which include the UK academics\u2019 pension fund and international investors from China, Canada and Abu Dhabi, have labelled the company \u201cuninvestible\u201d and refused to put in more money. That has left Thames heading for a painful restructuring deal that is expected to wipe out shareholders and see its lenders seize the company \u2013 or it be forced into temporary state ownership. The choice of debt deal is crucial as it could feed into the terms by which new equity investors sign up to take on Thames. The successful group would ultimately have a greater say over who takes control of the water company that serves 16 million customers in London and the Thames valley. Group A represents \u00a312bn of Thames\u2019 debt, v a much smaller junior debt pile held by group B. Group A includes controversial US hedge funds Elliott Partners and Silver Point, as well as some well-known UK fund managers such as M&amp;G group, and wants to charge Thames annual interest of 9.75% \u2013 plus relatively high fees, particularly if the debt is repaid early. Group B lenders would charge interest at a lower rate of 8% with significantly lower fees and different conditions. Both camps insist on having \u201csuper senior\u201d status \u2013 ranking above the A bonds in the event of a default. While Thames\u2019s chairman, Sir Adrian Montague, has already said it intends to proceed with the group A deal, its board was split on Friday over which deal is best after the group B offer emerged last week, people familiar with their thinking said. It is understood that a committee of the board at Thames \u2013 rather than a full board meeting \u2013 was convened to debate their merits. \u201cWe have a very clear duty to consider not just survival but sustainability of finances.

If both deals were to fail, Thames could fall into a form of temporary re-nationalisation known as a special administration regime. The competing groups are racing to get the board and other creditors to sign up to their deals, with a deadline of 5pm on Monday 11 November imposed for group A supporters. Group B claims it is offering better terms than group A, saving Thames hundreds of millions relative to the deal from the A group.

      "bodyText": "The Western Australian Labor government appears all but certain to give one of Australia\u2019s biggest greenhouse gas emitters the green light to operate until 2070 after it announced it would abolish state emissions-reduction requirements. Scientists have warned the proposal to extend the life of the North West Shelf gas processing plant on the Burrup Peninsula in the country\u2019s remote north-west is linked to the development of at least three major gas fields and could ultimately result in billions of tonnes of climate pollution being released into the atmosphere. The WA Environment Protection Authority recommended in 2022 that the state approve a 50-year extension for the plant, which is run by the oil and gas company Woodside, as long as it progressively reduced its operating emissions. It could do that by making cuts onsite or paying for carbon offsets. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email More than 750 organisations and individuals lodged appeals against the recommendation \u2013 a record for the state \u2013 citing its contribution to the climate crisis and potential damage to Indigenous rock art. The WA appeals convenor has been considering the objections since mid 2022. But the WA government last month announced it would change rules so that the EPA would no longer regulate emissions from development proposals that released significant climate pollution. The WA climate change minister, Reece Whitby, then wrote to people who lodged appeals against the North West Shelf extension, giving them under 8 November to respond. Climate activists said the implicit message of the letter was that the state government planned to effectively abandon the years-long EPA process considering how to deal with emissions from the plant. The Conservation Council of WA\u2019s executive director, Jess Beckerling, said total emissions from the extension of fossil fuel operations on the Burrup Hub could reach 6bn tonnes once the gas was exported and burned overseas. \u201cThe WA government has just stripped itself of the ability to effectively regulate the impact of climate change from the biggest fossil fuel projects in the country,\u201d she said. The WA government\u2019s rationale for the change is that emissions released directly from developments within Australia \u2013 but not those released overseas \u2013 are covered by a federal government emissions policy, the safeguard mechanism. The extension also needs approval under federal conservation law. A state government spokesperson said it was \u201cfocused on removing duplication that doesn\u2019t deliver any additional environmental benefit\u201d. \u201cOur expectation is the requirements for projects to reduce emissions through the safeguard mechanism will cumulatively result in the same if not stronger action on emissions,\u201d they said. \u201cIt does not change our commitment to working with all sectors of the economy to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.\u201d But Piers Verstegen of WA-based Climate Safe Solutions said the change would likely lead to higher emissions as the state EPA\u2019s recommendations could lead to more stringent cuts after 2030 than under the safeguard mechanism. The safeguard mechanism requires Australia\u2019s 215 biggest industrial emitting sites to cut their emissions intensity by 4.9% a year until 2030, but export facilities such as the North West Shelf could apply for a lower rate. The rate of emissions reduction for each site has not yet been released. Required cuts after 2030 will be set in 2027. The state EPA\u2019s recommendations in 2022 said the site should have to reduce its emissions progressively, with limits set in five-year blocks, to reach net zero by 2050. It said companies were expected to demonstrate that they were acting to first avoid, then reduce and finally offset emissions. Guardian Australia asked the WA government if it had an analysis that showed there would be no greater climate impact once its regulations were removed and if that analysis was publicly available. It did not directly answer the question. It said its decision followed a review of environmental approval processes and constitutional advice from the state\u2019s solicitor general. Constitutional lawyers have responded that there was nothing to legally prevent state governments legislating to cut emissions. The federal legislation governing the safeguard mechanism says it is \u201cnot intended to exclude or limit the operation of a law of a state or territory that is capable of operating concurrently\u201d with it. The removal of state emissions regulations was welcomed by Woodside, Australia\u2019s biggest oil and gas company. It called on other states to remove climate regulations. The Greens MP Brad Pettitt said the change showed the WA government was \u201cnot even pretending to try to reduce WA\u2019s emissions any more\u201d. WA is the only Australian state without a 2030 emissions reduction target, and the only state in which climate pollution has increased over the past 20 years. National data says climate pollution in the five eastern states fell by at least 27% between 2005 and 2022 while rising 8% in WA, largely due to the state\u2019s expanding gas export industry. Pettitt said the state\u2019s policy \u201ccan only have been influenced by one thing \u2013 big gas corporations who will save millions under the lower emissions standards required by the federal safeguard mechanism\u201d. \u201cWestern Australia\u2019s sycophantic support of gas and lack of climate action is dragging down the whole country\u2019s climate ambition and also slowing the uptake of renewable energy in Asia,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a globally irresponsible decision.\u201d Beckerling said: \u201cThe North West Shelf extension is Australia\u2019s biggest climate decision and the WA government is trying to wash its hands of its responsibility to hold Woodside to account.\u201d",

I said, he\u2019s really the hero of this film and he has to save his mum. I was really careful not to damage him psychologically or emotionally. He didn\u2019t hear any of the swearing or see any really scary stuff \u2013 like Essie gliding towards the camera.</p>    <p><strong>Davis: </strong>If you couldn\u2019t see my mouth on camera, I would say completely different things; I\u2019d say, \u201cGo and eat dirt!\u201d And then he would leave the room and I\u2019d do the whole scene again with an adult stand-in on his knees.</p> <p>In one sequence where I supposedly have a knife in my hand and I\u2019m following him around, Noah whacked his elbow really badly. I could see tears come into his eyes. [I said] \u201cWe gotta use it. Noah, use it!\u201d He kept on going, and he was so proud of using that accidental pain in the scene.

But then we had to kill the dog. We found someone in Melbourne [to make a prop dog] but he had a pre-cast of another dog; we couldn\u2019t get the same breed.

His name is Tim Purcell and he\u2019s an old friend of Alex [Holmes, the production designer and Ceyton\u2019s husband].</p> <p><strong>Tim Purcell, the Babadook</strong>: I\u2019d just got out of a relationship. I rang up [Kristina and Alex] and I said, I\u2019m packing my car and driving down to South Australia. I didn\u2019t even ask them. I was basically assisting Alex with squillions of things: building the whole house on set, ageing wallpaper, I made the Babadook\u2019s claws.</p> <p>They wanted to do this stop-motion stuff with the Babadook, and they were going to hire a body movement actor for $15,000. I was there and I\u2019m six foot seven. I had just done three months of hot yoga after the end of my relationship. The visual effects guy was like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just get your friend to do it?\u201d </p> <p>When the shooting started, I got dressed up and harnessed to a ceiling. I had this mouth prosthetic in so I literally couldn\u2019t control the drool out of my mouth. I\u2019m in the film for all of 1.3 seconds.</p> <p><strong>Kent: </strong>We just needed the tallest, lankiest guy who was prepared to stay in positions for a long time.</p> <h2><strong>The runaway success</strong></h2> <p><em>If the shoot was difficult, then what came next \u2013 the feedback from funders and test audiences \u2013 was even worse. But against all odds, the film </em><em>was a hit.</em></p> <p><strong>Ceyton</strong>: At one test screening, people were invited to give feedback and it was so awful and so negative.</p> <p><strong>Kent:</strong> Everyone from [government film funding agency] Screen Australia hated it. My editor did a version with all the bits that no one wanted to give feedback on and it was literally, like, 45 seconds.</p>    <p><strong>Davis: </strong>The first time I saw it I remember thinking: what a shame, it\u2019s not scary, right? Then we went to Sundance, and I was sitting in the back row watching the audience leaping out of their seats and jumping up and down. The volume of the reaction! Afterwards, guys in their 60s with handlebar mos and leather jackets were coming up and going, \u201cThat\u2019s the story of me and my mum.\u201d And teenage girls. It was this weird spectrum of reaching so many people.</p> <p><strong>Ceyton: </strong>There was a real buzz during Sundance. But it could\u2019ve gone either way, right? I had no idea if people were gonna hate it or love it. And then within hours of the release, we had mostly positive reviews come out. That was a huge relief.</p> <p><strong>Kent: </strong>I measure the success of something by the response I get back personally. I had one young man say he was the son of a single mother, and his father died when he was seven. He said The Babadook was so profound for him, it was better than 20 years of therapy. There was a librarian who\u2019d lost his young wife and wrote me a really beautiful email.

In the dark you might only make out his cheeks, a shock of bone-white puncturing the night. He is furry, hairy, a little scary. Or maybe he\u2019s just misunderstood? You know the Babadook even if you haven\u2019t seen the film: Australian director Jennifer Kent\u2019s ornate, expressionistic horror that premiered at Sundance in 2014 before becoming a household meme a few years later. The creature leaps from a menacing picture book to torment a single mother, Amelia (Essie Davis), and her son Sam (Noah Wiseman). The pair\u2019s already spiky relationship grows increasingly terrifying as the monster invades their suburban abode. Will they banish him before he tears them apart for good? The movie debuted to acclaim: the Guardian called it a \u201cclever, nasty, clammily claustrophobic chiller\u201d, while the New York Times exalted it as a \u201ctour de force of maternal anguish\u201d. For two years it remained a beloved (if under-seen) cult entry \u2013 until a viral 2016 Tumblr post labelled the Babadook a queer mascot. Suddenly, he was appearing at pride marches and parties and red carpets, spewing glitter from his demonic maw and brandishing rainbow flags in his talons. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning For The Babadook\u2019s 10th anniversary, we speak to the film\u2019s driving forces about its origins, its success and its unlikely afterlife. The beginning Before The Babadook, there was Monster \u2013 Kent\u2019s 2005 short film which she developed into her feature over six months at Binger Filmlab, a workshop in Amsterdam. Jennifer Kent, director: I had a friend [whose son] was three or four, and he was talking about seeing this monster man in his house. It was kind of obsessive and my friend was like, \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d So she just started pretending that it was real, and talking to it with her son. That\u2019s how Monster came about. I had no intention whatsoever to write a feature version \u2013 but I wrote five or six feature scripts, and none of them were getting made. I thought: right, I need to go back to basics and make something very achievable, set in a house. Kristina Ceyton, The Babadook producer and co-founder of Causeway Films: Jen and I met at a short film festival in Aspen [where] she had Monster playing. When she approached me [with The Babadook], I remember reading the first draft alone in the office and it was getting dark. It scared the bejeezus out of me. But not only that: I was really moved by this mother-son relationship. Essie Davis, actor: Jen and I have been friends for ever. She was in the year above me at Nida [Sydney\u2019s National Institute for Dramatic Art]. I remember reading the screenplay at the airport. I was waiting on the grass outside, and I was just turning the pages. Because I am a mother, I was very aware of the brutality of parenthood, but I was nervous about portraying a mother in that situation. The child The Babadook lives and dies by its central performance: the precocious, troubled Sam, played by then six-year-old Noah Wiseman. He was a natural. Ceyton: We found him in this little after-school drama class. He was tiny, but he was really smart and connected. It was like casting the boy as well as his parents \u2013 his mum was a psychologist and I think she was initially quite wary.

There is no genius prose, no wild insights, just a hell of a lot of handwritten details of my life. Mostly they were penned across late nights, with eyes swollen \u2013 once with teenage tears, but these days it\u2019s parental fatigue. It used to be all love affairs gone wrong, now it\u2019s baby\u2019s first words and climate change.</p> <p>I think some part of me hopes that one day I\u2019ll read them all in succession and everything will make perfect sense.</p> <h2>My most useful object</h2>    <p>The most useful object in our house is not a vibrator. It will sound like a vibrator in my description, no matter what I do. So please just remember \u2013 I am not talking about a vibrator.</p> <p>We call it the \u201cdooga dooga\u201d. It is black, triangular, with a foam pad that pounds up and down with a violent jack hammer action \u2013 still not a vibrator. It\u2019s a ninja-level massage tool that has become essential after the kids are finally asleep. Its lowest setting rattles my teeth and almost makes me want to spew, but in a good way.</p> <p>After jamming the dooga dooga into my own trapezius, the knot you get from wrestling a two-year-old into a car seat loosens just enough to allow me to eat a block of excruciatingly dark chocolate.</p> <h2>The item I most regret losing</h2> <p>When my sister and I were little we\u2019d record radio programs into our tape deck. There was this one particular tape, with a paper label that read \u201cJudy\u2019s Scales\u201d which featured all our best gags. We\u2019d listen to it over and over, toasting to our bad American accents and well-timed fart jokes. Mum used to cry with laughter and I was sure we were a genius comedy duo.</p> <p>But one day Judy\u2019s Scales went missing, and I felt like Dumbo without his feather. For years after I would turn the house upside down looking for it and couldn\u2019t understand why Mum and Elana weren\u2019t helping. I felt like we\u2019d recorded the best part of our childhood and, by losing it, we lost our magic.</p> <p>Fifteen years or so later, the night of my 21st birthday, it all made sense. No one understood as my mum and sister played some crackly audio of two little kids snorting and farting over the PA but I exploded with joy. They\u2019d hidden it from me and watched me searching for it \u2013 never saying a word.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Yael Stone and Jack Manning Bancroft feature in an </em><em> episode of Australian Story, <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-21/the-two-of-us/104499592\">available to stream </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-21/the-two-of-us/104499592\">on ABC iView</a></em></p></li> </ul>",

What I\u2019d save from my house in a fire I\u2019m embarrassed to admit I\u2019d save my diaries. There is no genius prose, no wild insights, just a hell of a lot of handwritten details of my life. Mostly they were penned across late nights, with eyes swollen \u2013 once with teenage tears, but these days it\u2019s parental fatigue. It used to be all love affairs gone wrong, now it\u2019s baby\u2019s first words and climate change. I think some part of me hopes that one day I\u2019ll read them all in succession and everything will make perfect sense. My most useful object The most useful object in our house is not a vibrator. It will sound like a vibrator in my description, no matter what I do. So please just remember \u2013 I am not talking about a vibrator. We call it the \u201cdooga dooga\u201d. It is black, triangular, with a foam pad that pounds up and down with a violent jack hammer action \u2013 still not a vibrator. It\u2019s a ninja-level massage tool that has become essential after the kids are finally asleep. Its lowest setting rattles my teeth and almost makes me want to spew, but in a good way. After jamming the dooga dooga into my own trapezius, the knot you get from wrestling a two-year-old into a car seat loosens just enough to allow me to eat a block of excruciatingly dark chocolate. The item I most regret losing When my sister and I were little we\u2019d record radio programs into our tape deck. There was this one particular tape, with a paper label that read \u201cJudy\u2019s Scales\u201d which featured all our best gags. We\u2019d listen to it over and over, toasting to our bad American accents and well-timed fart jokes. Mum used to cry with laughter and I was sure we were a genius comedy duo. But one day Judy\u2019s Scales went missing, and I felt like Dumbo without his feather. For years after I would turn the house upside down looking for it and couldn\u2019t understand why Mum and Elana weren\u2019t helping. I felt like we\u2019d recorded the best part of our childhood and, by losing it, we lost our magic. Fifteen years or so later, the night of my 21st birthday, it all made sense. No one understood as my mum and sister played some crackly audio of two little kids snorting and farting over the PA but I exploded with joy. They\u2019d hidden it from me and watched me searching for it \u2013 never saying a word.

      "body": "<p>Until relatively recently, if you were mixing a scoop of powdered creatine into a glass of water each day, it probably meant you were a bodybuilder or training for an athletic event. Although creatine is a compound that occurs naturally in the body, its role in producing quick bursts of energy meant that, if you took extra, it was assumed to be in order to (legally) enhance your performance \u2013 to help you squat a fractionally heavier weight or run a bit faster.</p> <p>But evidence has been mounting that creatine may play an important role in cognitive function and improving brain health \u2013 and could be more beneficial to women than it is to gym bros. So, should we all take it \u2013 or at least try to get more of it from food? </p> <p>Let\u2019s start with creatine\u2019s best-understood benefit \u2013 boosting physical power and energy. In the simplest terms, the body generates energy by breaking down a molecule produced from glucose called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The problem is that ATP isn\u2019t easy for the body to store, so it\u2019s produced constantly and used up fairly quickly. This means that the small amount of ATP normally available provides enough energy for your body to run at full capacity for just a few seconds \u2013 which is why sprinters and weightlifters can give near-maximum effort only in short bursts.</p> <p>Creatine aids this process by acting as a buffer: it allows ATP to be produced more quickly, so that you can give more effort for longer.</p> <p>The effect can be dramatic. In some studies, it has helped volunteers to increase the amount of weight they can lift by <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10449017/\">more than 30%</a> and, in other research, to add <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29214923/\">significantly more muscle</a>. More recently, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7739317/\">studies suggest</a> that supplementing with creatine when following a training programme can help people 50 or older to lose moderate amounts of body fat and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8228369/\">may help with recovery</a> from tough training sessions.</p> <p>But the benefits go beyond getting stronger, faster or leaner. Creatine may help older people in various other ways. \u201cWe\u2019ve known for a long time that creatine helps muscle protein synthesis \u2013 the research on that is quite clear,\u201d says Dr Henry Chung, a lecturer in sport, rehabilitation and exercise science at the University of Essex. \u201cBut there\u2019s now a lot of research to say that creatine might have beneficial effects on age-related issues, like muscle loss or cognitive decline. It\u2019s not conclusive \u2013 and it might be more beneficial for some people than others.\u201d</p> <p>A meta-review of more than 1,000 studies, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7910963/\">published in 2021</a>, suggests that creatine may deliver a host of beneficial effects in the body, from helping to control blood-sugar levels to lowering cholesterol and risk of stroke. But where does cognitive function fit in?</p> <p>\u201cThe brain consumes a lot of energy to function properly,\u201d says Dr Jenna Macciochi, an immunologist at the University of Sussex who specialises in the intersection of nutrition, movement and lifestyle with health; she is also part of a team developing a creatine supplement for post-menopausal women. \u201cBy supporting our energy systems, creatine supports the neurons of the brain as they do their job. There\u2019s a decent amount of evidence supporting the idea that it helps with things like mental clarity, focus and cognitive endurance over long periods of time.\u201d</p> <p>A study released <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-54249-9\">in February</a>, for instance, suggests that, if you are sleep-deprived, creatine can diminish some of the negative effects. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6769464/\">Other studies</a> have been conducted into whether it works as an antidepressant (more research is needed).</p> <p>Another, longer-term benefit is still being investigated, says Macciochi: \u201cIt might have neuroprotective properties, which means it can help protect the brain from damage caused by things like oxidative stress \u2013 which is basically what happens when the free radicals being produced by things like alcohol, cigarette smoke or pollution outweigh the antioxidants your body is producing.\u201d</p> <p>Oxidative stress is a central driver of ageing, she says: \u201cLike a car rusting over time \u2026 even if you take really good care of it, there\u2019s a certain amount of wear and tear that builds up.\u201d </p> <p>While there isn\u2019t enough evidence to show that creatine can protect against neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer\u2019s, the effects it has shown on cognitive decline make it a promising area of investigation. And it may be more beneficial for women than men.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen creatine be hugely beneficial for women going through perimenopause,\u201d says the dietitian Brittany Werner, who is the director of Working Against Gravity, a nutritional coaching company. \u201cWomen generally have between <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7998865/#:~:text=Despite%20extensive%20research%20on%20creatine,creatine%20stores%20compared%20to%20males.\">70% and 80% less</a> creatine stored than men and also tend to consume less through diet. That means it can be really important for women to make sure they are getting enough \u2013 especially during periods of hormonal fluctuations, including periods, pregnancy, postpartum, perimenopause and post-menopause.\u201d</p> <p>So, how do you make sure you are getting enough? If you are an enthusiastic omnivore, you may have plenty in the tank \u2013 creatine is a carninutrient, which means that most of us can ingest it only through animal products (babies get it from <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK501853/#:~:text=Creatine%20is%20a%20normal%20component,of%20the%20infant's%20daily%20requirements.\">breast milk</a>).</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/nov/09/how-do-i-cook-game-kitchen-aide\">Wild game</a> is one of the best sources, but red meat and fish \u2013 particularly herring, salmon and tuna \u2013 are excellent, as are most types of milk and cheese. If you are a vegan, you will have to rely on the stores your body can produce through amino acids \u2013 you can top these up with seeds, grains, nuts and legumes, but you could be operating with sub-optimal levels. Extremely low levels may lead to weight loss or fatigue, but even a bit of a deficit can leave you tired or struggling at the gym.</p> <p>So, how much should you take \u2013 and how? Traditionally, the way to supplement creatine was as a scoop of (slightly gritty) powder in water, but brands have branched out into tablets, gummies and more. It\u2019s most often sold in monohydrate form \u2013 so called because each creatine molecule is bound to a water molecule. Other kinds, such as creatine hydrochloride and creatine ethyl ester, are sometimes claimed to be more readily absorbed by the body, but <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0765159719302011\">the research</a> <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4469200/\">is inconclusive</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe dosing is a bit challenging,\u201d says Macciochi. \u201cWe know very well that, in terms of exercise performance, 3g to 5g a day is a really solid dose \u2013 if you take it consistently, that\u2019s going to give you evidence-based performance improvements. But in terms of other benefits, some studies are using 10g a day and some even 20g, depending on the conditions they are studying, so it\u2019s still under discussion.\u201d</p> <p>Bodybuilders used to suggest a \u201cloading\u201d phase \u2013 extra helpings to get your body\u2019s stores up to speed quickly \u2013 but that is probably unnecessary, Macciochi explains. \u201cIf you\u2019re already 70% saturated, you want to get to 100% \u2013 you can do that quicker by taking a higher dose and then going on a maintenance dose,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if you start on a maintenance dose, like 5g a day, and then continue on it, it\u2019s only going to take a couple of days longer. I think the loading idea comes from the need to get those performance benefits in the gym as soon as possible, but it\u2019s not strictly necessary.\u201d</p> <p>It used to be thought that supplementing with creatine increased the risk of dehydration from heavy exercise, but a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7871530/\">2021 meta-review</a> rules out this effect \u2013 high doses can increase muscular water retention, but that seems to taper off once the body has adapted. </p> <p>It was also thought that creatine might affect kidney function; a <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31375416/\">recent meta-analysis</a> seems to suggest otherwise, although it\u2019s important to note that if you already have kidney damage, excess creatine may worsen it. Consult a doctor before starting any supplement programme.</p> <p>Finally, some scare stories have linked creatine to baldness, with <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19741313/\">one 2009 study</a> finding increased levels of DHT, a byproduct of testosterone that can lead to hair loss. However, the study looked only at 20 men, the dose was very large (20g a day, which almost no one would recommend for everyday use) and no direct link was found.

      "bodyText": "Until relatively recently, if you were mixing a scoop of powdered creatine into a glass of water each day, it probably meant you were a bodybuilder or training for an athletic event. Although creatine is a compound that occurs naturally in the body, its role in producing quick bursts of energy meant that, if you took extra, it was assumed to be in order to (legally) enhance your performance \u2013 to help you squat a fractionally heavier weight or run a bit faster. But evidence has been mounting that creatine may play an important role in cognitive function and improving brain health \u2013 and could be more beneficial to women than it is to gym bros. So, should we all take it \u2013 or at least try to get more of it from food? Let\u2019s start with creatine\u2019s best-understood benefit \u2013 boosting physical power and energy. In the simplest terms, the body generates energy by breaking down a molecule produced from glucose called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The problem is that ATP isn\u2019t easy for the body to store, so it\u2019s produced constantly and used up fairly quickly. This means that the small amount of ATP normally available provides enough energy for your body to run at full capacity for just a few seconds \u2013 which is why sprinters and weightlifters can give near-maximum effort only in short bursts. Creatine aids this process by acting as a buffer: it allows ATP to be produced more quickly, so that you can give more effort for longer. The effect can be dramatic. In some studies, it has helped volunteers to increase the amount of weight they can lift by more than 30% and, in other research, to add significantly more muscle. More recently, studies suggest that supplementing with creatine when following a training programme can help people 50 or older to lose moderate amounts of body fat and may help with recovery from tough training sessions. But the benefits go beyond getting stronger, faster or leaner. Creatine may help older people in various other ways. \u201cWe\u2019ve known for a long time that creatine helps muscle protein synthesis \u2013 the research on that is quite clear,\u201d says Dr Henry Chung, a lecturer in sport, rehabilitation and exercise science at the University of Essex. \u201cBut there\u2019s now a lot of research to say that creatine might have beneficial effects on age-related issues, like muscle loss or cognitive decline. It\u2019s not conclusive \u2013 and it might be more beneficial for some people than others.\u201d A meta-review of more than 1,000 studies, published in 2021, suggests that creatine may deliver a host of beneficial effects in the body, from helping to control blood-sugar levels to lowering cholesterol and risk of stroke. But where does cognitive function fit in? \u201cThe brain consumes a lot of energy to function properly,\u201d says Dr Jenna Macciochi, an immunologist at the University of Sussex who specialises in the intersection of nutrition, movement and lifestyle with health; she is also part of a team developing a creatine supplement for post-menopausal women. \u201cBy supporting our energy systems, creatine supports the neurons of the brain as they do their job. There\u2019s a decent amount of evidence supporting the idea that it helps with things like mental clarity, focus and cognitive endurance over long periods of time.\u201d A study released in February, for instance, suggests that, if you are sleep-deprived, creatine can diminish some of the negative effects. Other studies have been conducted into whether it works as an antidepressant (more research is needed). Another, longer-term benefit is still being investigated, says Macciochi: \u201cIt might have neuroprotective properties, which means it can help protect the brain from damage caused by things like oxidative stress \u2013 which is basically what happens when the free radicals being produced by things like alcohol, cigarette smoke or pollution outweigh the antioxidants your body is producing.\u201d Oxidative stress is a central driver of ageing, she says: \u201cLike a car rusting over time \u2026 even if you take really good care of it, there\u2019s a certain amount of wear and tear that builds up.\u201d While there isn\u2019t enough evidence to show that creatine can protect against neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer\u2019s, the effects it has shown on cognitive decline make it a promising area of investigation. And it may be more beneficial for women than men. \u201cI\u2019ve seen creatine be hugely beneficial for women going through perimenopause,\u201d says the dietitian Brittany Werner, who is the director of Working Against Gravity, a nutritional coaching company. \u201cWomen generally have between 70% and 80% less creatine stored than men and also tend to consume less through diet. That means it can be really important for women to make sure they are getting enough \u2013 especially during periods of hormonal fluctuations, including periods, pregnancy, postpartum, perimenopause and post-menopause.\u201d So, how do you make sure you are getting enough? If you are an enthusiastic omnivore, you may have plenty in the tank \u2013 creatine is a carninutrient, which means that most of us can ingest it only through animal products (babies get it from breast milk). Wild game is one of the best sources, but red meat and fish \u2013 particularly herring, salmon and tuna \u2013 are excellent, as are most types of milk and cheese. If you are a vegan, you will have to rely on the stores your body can produce through amino acids \u2013 you can top these up with seeds, grains, nuts and legumes, but you could be operating with sub-optimal levels. Extremely low levels may lead to weight loss or fatigue, but even a bit of a deficit can leave you tired or struggling at the gym. So, how much should you take \u2013 and how? Traditionally, the way to supplement creatine was as a scoop of (slightly gritty) powder in water, but brands have branched out into tablets, gummies and more. It\u2019s most often sold in monohydrate form \u2013 so called because each creatine molecule is bound to a water molecule. Other kinds, such as creatine hydrochloride and creatine ethyl ester, are sometimes claimed to be more readily absorbed by the body, but the research is inconclusive. \u201cThe dosing is a bit challenging,\u201d says Macciochi. \u201cWe know very well that, in terms of exercise performance, 3g to 5g a day is a really solid dose \u2013 if you take it consistently, that\u2019s going to give you evidence-based performance improvements. But in terms of other benefits, some studies are using 10g a day and some even 20g, depending on the conditions they are studying, so it\u2019s still under discussion.\u201d Bodybuilders used to suggest a \u201cloading\u201d phase \u2013 extra helpings to get your body\u2019s stores up to speed quickly \u2013 but that is probably unnecessary, Macciochi explains. \u201cIf you\u2019re already 70% saturated, you want to get to 100% \u2013 you can do that quicker by taking a higher dose and then going on a maintenance dose,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if you start on a maintenance dose, like 5g a day, and then continue on it, it\u2019s only going to take a couple of days longer. I think the loading idea comes from the need to get those performance benefits in the gym as soon as possible, but it\u2019s not strictly necessary.\u201d It used to be thought that supplementing with creatine increased the risk of dehydration from heavy exercise, but a 2021 meta-review rules out this effect \u2013 high doses can increase muscular water retention, but that seems to taper off once the body has adapted. It was also thought that creatine might affect kidney function; a recent meta-analysis seems to suggest otherwise, although it\u2019s important to note that if you already have kidney damage, excess creatine may worsen it. Consult a doctor before starting any supplement programme. Finally, some scare stories have linked creatine to baldness, with one 2009 study finding increased levels of DHT, a byproduct of testosterone that can lead to hair loss. However, the study looked only at 20 men, the dose was very large (20g a day, which almost no one would recommend for everyday use) and no direct link was found. In any case, the 2021 meta-review seems to have ruled out the problem. Some studies have found that gut problems, including diarrhoea and belching, can occur with high doses, but these seem to be avoidable. \u201cGenerally speaking, it doesn\u2019t seem to bother most people, but gut health is unique to us,\u201d says Macciochi. \u201cThat said, if you take it with food or drop the dose and build up slowly, it gives your body a chance to adapt better. It\u2019s like any sudden dietary change \u2013 you get digestive feedback.\u201d To sum up, creatine has benefits for strength and sports performance, seems to have benefits for cognition and could support women\u2019s health during menopause. But it\u2019s not a magic formula. \u201cCreatine works because you can push yourself at an intensity that creates an adaptive response,\u201d says Chung. \u201cIf you take creatine and don\u2019t do those activities, whether physical or cognitive, the benefits are likely to be quite minimal.\u201d In other words, you still have to do the work. But you probably knew that anyway. Eat for your age Creatine isn\u2019t the only nutrient that it can be helpful to top up as you get older. Here is what else you may be missing. Vitamin D Crucial for maintaining bone, muscle and teeth health (it helps the body absorb calcium), especially for older women who are at higher risk of osteoporosis after menopause.

And the turbulence that Trump is about to unleash \u2013 alongside pain and cruelty and hardship \u2013 is possible because that\u2019s where we already live: in information chaos.</p> <p>It\u2019s exactly eight years since we realised there were invisible undercurrents flowing beneath the surface of our world. Or perhaps I&nbsp;should talk for myself here. It was when<em> I </em>realised. A week before the 2016 US presidential election, I spotted a weird constellation of events and googled \u201ctech disruption\u201d + \u201cdemocracy\u201d, found not a single hit and pitched a piece to my editor.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/06/technology-disruption-infects-political-system\">It was published on 6 November 2016</a>. In it, I quoted the \u201ctechnology mudslide hypothesis\u201d a concept invented by Clayton Christensen, a professor at Harvard Business School, who coined the term \u201cdisruption\u201d \u2013 a process endlessly fetishised in tech circles, in which a scrappy upstart such as Microsoft could overthrow a colossus like IBM.</p> <p>Whoever wins, I wrote, this election represented \u201cthe Great Disruption.

Is a free and fair election possible in a post-truth world?\u201d</p>    <p>That article was the beginning of my own Alice in Wonderland tumble down the rabbit hole. And I reread it with the sinking knowledge that this next presidential term may yet provide those answers.

We\u2019ve learned about information warfare.

It has not been previously published.</p> <p>It depicts a Wollongong steelworker, Jim McNeill, distinctive in a slouch hat and his Second Australian Imperial Force uniform. He stands at the front of a small group of men, all poised and ready to march. While McNeill is distinguished by his Australian Army uniform, the others are all neatly besuited.

      "bodyText": "This Remembrance Day consider a photograph and the story it holds about Australians whose war service has largely been deliberately overlooked or forgotten by the tellers of this country\u2019s martial history. Held by the Illawarra Museum in Wollongong, the photograph was taken during a parade for May Day (International Workers\u2019 Day) in Sydney in 1944. It has not been previously published. It depicts a Wollongong steelworker, Jim McNeill, distinctive in a slouch hat and his Second Australian Imperial Force uniform. He stands at the front of a small group of men, all poised and ready to march. While McNeill is distinguished by his Australian Army uniform, the others are all neatly besuited. They wear neckties and some have pocket handkerchiefs and hats. They are among the 70 or so Australian men and women who joined the International Brigades to fight or serve as nurses or support workers to bolster the Spanish republic\u2019s bitter, bloody \u2013 but ultimately failed \u2013 military resistance to Franco\u2019s fascist forces from 1936 to 1939. I\u2019ve written previously and at length about them here. This group of men, marching together back home in New South Wales for what is believed to be the first and only time, had fought Europe fascism on the battlefield when the conservative Menzies government of Australia, like many others internationally, was still wedded to appeasement of fascist leaders such as Hitler and Franco. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email What renders this photograph so compelling and important is the consistency that it depicts between the fighting of fascists during the Spanish civil war and, in the case of McNeill, elsewhere in Europe later during the second world war, for which he also volunteered. The Australian members of the International Brigades travelled and fought under their own steam. Though they came from all walks of life and professions, a good many were communists and dedicated trade unionists like McNeill, and their actions at the time were at odds with \u2013 and frowned upon \u2013 by their government. Well before they went to Spain some, again McNeill included, were clashing on Sydney\u2019s streets with members of the New Guard, a fiercely pro-monarchist, anti-communist, secretive, pro-fascist organisation. McNeill narrowly missed being shot in one such clash on the streets of harbourside Drummoyne in 1931. McNeill fought Franco\u2019s fascists, including at the brutal battle of Ebro in 1938 (a turning point in the war), alongside a fellow Wollongong steelworker, Joe Carter, and a storied Sydney dock worker, Jack Franklyn. McNeill was wounded by machine-gun fire at Ebro (his second wounding in Spain). The year after this rugged trio survived Ebro, their government back home was still appeasing European fascism, with Robert Menzies in July 1939 declaring: \u201cHistory will label Hitler as one of the really great men of the century.\u201d Not so much, as it happened. Australia was not alone in choosing to ignore the ominous warning signs of the moment, highlighting perhaps how hindsight, like rigorous history, can sometimes feel onerously prescient. Regardless, after returning to NSW, McNeill and Franklyn, both Communist party members, later enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force to fight Nazi Germany and its allies in Europe when Australia followed Great Britain into the second world war after Germany\u2019s invasion of Poland in September 1939. The historian Michael Samaras, who has completed a biography of McNeill, Anti-Fascist, writes about that photograph (which includes Franklyn) of the 1944 May Day march. He says the Spanish civil war veterans marched behind McNeill under a banner reading, \u201cInternational Brigaders. They fought fascism in 1936.

It acknowledges 70 Australian men and women (the women largely served as nurses and support workers) who fought for the Spanish republic. This week \u2013 two days after Remembrance Day \u2013 a privately funded memorial will be dedicated in the Melbourne Trades Hall precinct to honour the Australians who served in Spain (about 16 died). But it is high time, surely, that Australia\u2019s official memory extended to the veterans of Spain. They should be memorialised consistently with the ethos of Remembrance Day to remember all veterans who fought and died. \u2022 Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnist",

LastWarriorPoet I have an EU-to-UK window adaptor that I take on holiday so I can open my windows outwards, just like at home. Don\u2019t buy one at the airport, though \u2013 total rip-off.

      "body": "<p>It isn\u2019t every day that psychologists identify a hot new character archetype. Human design doesn\u2019t usually generate media stories about \u201cthe most-talked-about personality trait for autumn/winter\u201d. And yet, something close to this is unfolding with the current fascination with so-called \u201cdark empaths\u201d.</p> <p>On TikTok, the term has been trending, with more than 2.6m mentions. There\u2019s even a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/darkempathtok\">#darkempathtok hashtag</a>, all the better to locate the latest videos with ominous titles such as \u201cWhen an empath goes dark\u201d and \u201cThe most DANGEROUS personality\u201d. A measure of how far the idea has travelled is that, when I mentioned the phrase to my hairdresser, he helpfully explained: \u201cOh yes, they\u2019re the ones who are like narcissists, only more devious.\u201d</p> <p>Dark empaths were first identified in a 2021 study published in the <a href=\"https://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/40458/1/1351426_Heym.pdf\">journal Personality and Individual Differences</a>. Researchers defined it as \u201ca novel psychological construct\u201d concerning individuals who have a high degree of empathy alongside what\u2019s known as \u201cdark traits\u201d. How this plays out in practice is someone who appears to be caring and sensitive, but who is actually using those skills to further their own agenda.</p> <p>But how is it possible to manufacture empathy? Can\u2019t we as humans detect when that is being done? It turns out there is more than one type of empathy. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/24/superpower-empaths-paid-read-mind-empathy\">deeply caring type most of us understand</a> is called \u201caffective empathy\u201d \u2013 the real thing. \u201cIt is the degree to which I feel what you are feeling,\u201d says Nadja Heym, co-author of the research study and associate professor in personality psychology and psychopathology at Nottingham Trent University. \u201cSo, for example, when you feel sad, that makes me feel sad. But there\u2019s another type known as cognitive empathy. In that case, the script is: \u2018I know what you\u2019re thinking. I understand your mental state. But I really don\u2019t care about it.\u2019 And this information is important to the dark empath because, if they want to predict your behaviour, they need to understand what you\u2019re thinking in order to try to control you.\u201d It is this manipulation by stealth that can feel so unnerving if you are on the receiving end of it.</p> <p>Yasmin works in event management. \u201cIt was a very social vibe and Elaine, the new boss, liked to treat us to a Friday afternoon \u2018drinks trolley\u2019, AKA a few bottles of fizz being passed around the desks. The evening would often end in the pub.\u201d Soon, her boss started to share confidences about her personal life, prompting Yasmin to reveal her struggles in trying to get pregnant. \u201cIt felt great that my boss was also becoming a good friend and mentor, and made office life enjoyable.\u201d</p> <p>Things started to go wrong when Elaine confided about how stress was taking its toll on her health. She frequently asked Yasmin to take on extra tasks. \u201cI was happy to help her out knowing what pressure she was under from management. She had also hinted a promotion was in the offing for me. But then she embarked upon a not-so-subtle campaign to try to put me off the idea of starting a family. She\u2019d tell me that, at 35, I still had loads of time, and didn\u2019t I want to prioritise my career and future earnings first? It\u2019s only with hindsight that I realise what an outrageous boundary overstep this was. At the time, I genuinely thought she was looking out for me.\u201d</p> <p>A few months later, Yasmin discovered she was finally pregnant. \u201cI was nervous about telling Elaine but I wasn\u2019t expecting such an extreme reaction. She went ballistic and started screeching: \u2018How could you do this to me, after all I\u2019ve done for you?\u2019 After that, she excluded me from meetings and when the much-talked-about promotion was advertised, no surprise, I didn\u2019t even make the shortlist. Of course, I could have gone to HR but what would that have achieved? I never wanted to work with the woman again and transferred to another department before my daughter was born. But I\u2019m still annoyed with myself for having trusted her.\u201d</p> <p>Unfortunately, dark empaths are extremely good at getting their prey to drop their defences. \u201cThey intellectually assemble an understanding of the other person\u2019s weaknesses, where their loyalties might lie and what their insecurities are,\u201d explains <a href=\"https://disarmingthenarcissist.com/about-wendy-behary/\">Wendy Behary, therapist and author of Disarming the Narcissist.</a></p> <p>\u201cThey crave this knowledge because they can then use it to manipulate. For example, in a romantic relationship, say the dark empath knows that their wife derives a lot of pride from their workplace achievements and how she is viewed professionally. She gets an amazing job. That means the dark empath will feel at risk of potentially losing her to other people. He will lose the spotlight and, potentially, the right to make all of the decisions. Her success at work is making her feel special and he is losing his power over her. So in this scenario, he would typically scheme to bring the person down. He might say things like: \u2018I know how important it is for you to show up for work looking the part \u2013 but when you wear that dress you look like mutton dressed as lamb. I\u2019m very surprised, I thought you would know better.\u2019 It\u2019s all about shaming.\u201d</p> <p>Like their close relative the narcissist, dark empaths are territorial. According to Behary it is common for such types to create exclusion from friends, family and co-workers. \u201cIsolation means you are more likely to doubt yourself and the dark empath can make you rethink and distort your reality. So it\u2019s another form of gaslighting. You can only really successfully do that if you have an extremely good sense of another person\u2019s vulnerabilities \u2013 that\u2019s where the empath part comes in.\u201d</p> <p>One reason why there\u2019s so much interest in these types of people is because they present us with a puzzle: good and evil wrapped up in the same package. At the most diabolical level, a dark empath might show up in the form of a Jimmy Savile type. His skill in winning people\u2019s trust, posing as a charitable benefactor, allowed him to gain access to vulnerable young girls. But that\u2019s an extreme example. What\u2019s most striking about the recent dark empath research is that it reveals how prevalent the phenomenon is.</p> <p>\u201cWe identified it as a trait combination displayed by 19.3% of the 1,000 people we surveyed,\u201d says Heym. So almost one in five of us have this personality type? Heym sounds a note of caution. \u201cYes, but traits exist on a continuum \u2013 it\u2019s not about everyone having a personality disorder.\u201d</p> <p>An election candidate pretending to listen to constituents\u2019 problems in order to win votes is just one example of normalised dark empathy. It could also be the neighbour who always has time for a chat \u2013 but only because they want to extract gossip from you. Or the frenemy who eagerly pumps you for information about all your problems, all the better to boost their own sense of superiority. \u201cOur study focused on the general population and high empathy, combined with the prevalence of what we call maladaptive personality traits of the dark triad,\u201d explains Heym.</p> <p>The dark triad sounds like it could be the title of a schlocky horror franchise. What exactly is meant by the term? \u201cThere are three main traits involved,\u201d says Heym. \u201cPsychopathy (being impulsive and ruthless), narcissism (grandiose and entitled), and Machiavellianism (being strategic and manipulative). In some people, those traits overlap in a dark core.\u201d Think of it as a rather unsettling Venn diagram.</p>    <p>One of the things that makes a dark empath so difficult to identify is that most of us aren\u2019t on the lookout for fake compassion. Shona met Ian at their local running club. \u201cI was a newbie, unfit and overweight. He was so encouraging and supportive. He seemed a little shy, with a gentle manner. I trusted him.\u201d Ian mentioned how much money he had raised for charity, his volunteering at food banks and how he used to coach a junior football team.</p> <p>Soon, they became a couple and everything was great. But after just a few weeks, Shona began to feel uneasy about him. \u201cOne evening, we met up and I was upset because my grandmother had been taken to hospital. Ian was saying all the right words but there was something disengaged about him. I caught a glimpse of his face when he thought I wasn\u2019t looking and his expression was one of disdain. I thought maybe I\u2019d just imagined it but there were other signs of something being not quite right. He was always so keen to present himself as this caring person, but then one evening I came home to find him subjecting a delivery driver to an angry tirade. It worried me.\u201d</p> <p>Then, one day another woman at the club took her aside. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say much, just that she had also been involved with Ian until he dropped her for someone else, another runner at the club. It emerged that he had a well-known pattern of hitting on new female members, often keeping several on the go at the same time. Honestly, he was the least likely Lothario you could ever imagine, and it was precisely because of that that he was able to cheat on so many women. I broke up with him and he was outraged. I also learned that most of the good deeds he talked about were total fiction.\u201d</p> <p>It can sometimes be easier to spot a dark empath in a romantic or friendship relationship than a workplace one, suggests Heym. \u201cUsually, there is less to gain in personal relationships so the dark empath doesn\u2019t bother masking their lack of empathy to the same degree.\u201d That said, there are some telltale signs to look out for if you have doubts about someone, whatever the context. \u201cPay attention to whether they are using kindness and sympathy to gain something. Is there an ulterior motive? Have you seen evidence that they are capable of being ruthless towards others? Or are they maybe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/15/luisa-dillners-guide-personality-disorders\">more antagonistic than you would normally expect someone to be</a>?

      "bodyText": "It isn\u2019t every day that psychologists identify a hot new character archetype. Human design doesn\u2019t usually generate media stories about \u201cthe most-talked-about personality trait for autumn/winter\u201d. And yet, something close to this is unfolding with the current fascination with so-called \u201cdark empaths\u201d. On TikTok, the term has been trending, with more than 2.6m mentions. There\u2019s even a #darkempathtok hashtag, all the better to locate the latest videos with ominous titles such as \u201cWhen an empath goes dark\u201d and \u201cThe most DANGEROUS personality\u201d. A measure of how far the idea has travelled is that, when I mentioned the phrase to my hairdresser, he helpfully explained: \u201cOh yes, they\u2019re the ones who are like narcissists, only more devious.\u201d Dark empaths were first identified in a 2021 study published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences. Researchers defined it as \u201ca novel psychological construct\u201d concerning individuals who have a high degree of empathy alongside what\u2019s known as \u201cdark traits\u201d. How this plays out in practice is someone who appears to be caring and sensitive, but who is actually using those skills to further their own agenda. But how is it possible to manufacture empathy? Can\u2019t we as humans detect when that is being done? It turns out there is more than one type of empathy. The deeply caring type most of us understand is called \u201caffective empathy\u201d \u2013 the real thing. \u201cIt is the degree to which I feel what you are feeling,\u201d says Nadja Heym, co-author of the research study and associate professor in personality psychology and psychopathology at Nottingham Trent University. \u201cSo, for example, when you feel sad, that makes me feel sad. But there\u2019s another type known as cognitive empathy. In that case, the script is: \u2018I know what you\u2019re thinking. I understand your mental state. But I really don\u2019t care about it.\u2019 And this information is important to the dark empath because, if they want to predict your behaviour, they need to understand what you\u2019re thinking in order to try to control you.\u201d It is this manipulation by stealth that can feel so unnerving if you are on the receiving end of it. Yasmin works in event management. \u201cIt was a very social vibe and Elaine, the new boss, liked to treat us to a Friday afternoon \u2018drinks trolley\u2019, AKA a few bottles of fizz being passed around the desks. The evening would often end in the pub.\u201d Soon, her boss started to share confidences about her personal life, prompting Yasmin to reveal her struggles in trying to get pregnant. \u201cIt felt great that my boss was also becoming a good friend and mentor, and made office life enjoyable.\u201d Things started to go wrong when Elaine confided about how stress was taking its toll on her health. She frequently asked Yasmin to take on extra tasks. \u201cI was happy to help her out knowing what pressure she was under from management. She had also hinted a promotion was in the offing for me. But then she embarked upon a not-so-subtle campaign to try to put me off the idea of starting a family. She\u2019d tell me that, at 35, I still had loads of time, and didn\u2019t I want to prioritise my career and future earnings first? It\u2019s only with hindsight that I realise what an outrageous boundary overstep this was. At the time, I genuinely thought she was looking out for me.\u201d A few months later, Yasmin discovered she was finally pregnant. \u201cI was nervous about telling Elaine but I wasn\u2019t expecting such an extreme reaction. She went ballistic and started screeching: \u2018How could you do this to me, after all I\u2019ve done for you?\u2019 After that, she excluded me from meetings and when the much-talked-about promotion was advertised, no surprise, I didn\u2019t even make the shortlist. Of course, I could have gone to HR but what would that have achieved? I never wanted to work with the woman again and transferred to another department before my daughter was born. But I\u2019m still annoyed with myself for having trusted her.\u201d Unfortunately, dark empaths are extremely good at getting their prey to drop their defences. \u201cThey intellectually assemble an understanding of the other person\u2019s weaknesses, where their loyalties might lie and what their insecurities are,\u201d explains Wendy Behary, therapist and author of Disarming the Narcissist. \u201cThey crave this knowledge because they can then use it to manipulate. For example, in a romantic relationship, say the dark empath knows that their wife derives a lot of pride from their workplace achievements and how she is viewed professionally. She gets an amazing job. That means the dark empath will feel at risk of potentially losing her to other people. He will lose the spotlight and, potentially, the right to make all of the decisions. Her success at work is making her feel special and he is losing his power over her. So in this scenario, he would typically scheme to bring the person down. He might say things like: \u2018I know how important it is for you to show up for work looking the part \u2013 but when you wear that dress you look like mutton dressed as lamb. I\u2019m very surprised, I thought you would know better.\u2019 It\u2019s all about shaming.\u201d Like their close relative the narcissist, dark empaths are territorial. According to Behary it is common for such types to create exclusion from friends, family and co-workers. \u201cIsolation means you are more likely to doubt yourself and the dark empath can make you rethink and distort your reality. So it\u2019s another form of gaslighting. You can only really successfully do that if you have an extremely good sense of another person\u2019s vulnerabilities \u2013 that\u2019s where the empath part comes in.\u201d One reason why there\u2019s so much interest in these types of people is because they present us with a puzzle: good and evil wrapped up in the same package. At the most diabolical level, a dark empath might show up in the form of a Jimmy Savile type. His skill in winning people\u2019s trust, posing as a charitable benefactor, allowed him to gain access to vulnerable young girls. But that\u2019s an extreme example. What\u2019s most striking about the recent dark empath research is that it reveals how prevalent the phenomenon is. \u201cWe identified it as a trait combination displayed by 19.3% of the 1,000 people we surveyed,\u201d says Heym. So almost one in five of us have this personality type? Heym sounds a note of caution. \u201cYes, but traits exist on a continuum \u2013 it\u2019s not about everyone having a personality disorder.\u201d An election candidate pretending to listen to constituents\u2019 problems in order to win votes is just one example of normalised dark empathy. It could also be the neighbour who always has time for a chat \u2013 but only because they want to extract gossip from you. Or the frenemy who eagerly pumps you for information about all your problems, all the better to boost their own sense of superiority. \u201cOur study focused on the general population and high empathy, combined with the prevalence of what we call maladaptive personality traits of the dark triad,\u201d explains Heym. The dark triad sounds like it could be the title of a schlocky horror franchise. What exactly is meant by the term? \u201cThere are three main traits involved,\u201d says Heym. \u201cPsychopathy (being impulsive and ruthless), narcissism (grandiose and entitled), and Machiavellianism (being strategic and manipulative). In some people, those traits overlap in a dark core.\u201d Think of it as a rather unsettling Venn diagram.

      "body": "<p>A leading women\u2019s rights charity has called for the establishment of a domestic abuse commissioner in Northern Ireland to tackle one of the highest rates of femicide in Europe.</p> <p>There is heightened concern that policies tackling domestic violence in Northern Ireland have been held back by decades of sectarian division sucking political resources.</p> <p>In Northern Ireland since 2020, 24 women have been violently killed, all but one by a man, with 41 confirmed femicides since 2017 \u2013 the third highest rate in Europe and the highest in the UK and the island of Ireland per capita.</p> <p>Among them were Mary Ward, a 22-year-old mother of one, who was found dead in her south Belfast home last month. <a href=\"https://www.psni.police.uk/latest-news/man-arrested-suspicion-murder-mary-ward#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMary%20is%20the%20fourth%20woman,his%20life%20at%20the%20weekend.\">She was the fourth woman</a> to be allegedly murdered in six weeks, according to the Police Service of Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Campaigners have blamed the \u201cstop-start\u201d government in Northern Ireland, with the Stormont assembly suspended on at least eight occasions since it was formed in 1998 on the back of division between nationalists and unionists.</p> <p>Sonya McMullen, the regional services manager of Women\u2019s Aid Northern Ireland, said: \u201cIf you look at all the femicides in Ireland, 40% of those have been murdered in the north. We have a population of just 1.9 million compared to 5.15 million in the republic. So that is staggering to us.\u201d</p> <p>The charity is now calling on the Northern Ireland assembly to take action and develop a strategy that brings the region in line the rest of the UK.</p> <p>McMullen said the lack of legislative time on gender-based violence has meant Northern Ireland was last to bring in laws on domestic abuse, stalking and coercive control within relationships and laws on non-fatal strangulation.</p> <p>She added that deep-seated conservatism in Northern Ireland had led to a failure to adequately recognise women and girls as a disproportionate vulnerable category, unlike the rest of the UK.</p> <p>\u201cIn the North, everything was gender neutral. We had a first strategy to tackle violence in the home about 14 years ago but it was gender neutral. Nothing has been allowed to be specialised like it has in other parts of the country like England and Wales. Nothing was looked at through the gender lens,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole structure here is not very good and it all goes back to the bloody troubles, of green versus orange. Unfortunately, it has held us back. We still don\u2019t even have domestic abuse protection orders and emergency provisions that the rest of the country have.</p> <p>\u201cIt is time for real action and strong leadership.\u201d</p> <p>She acknowledged that the first minister, Michelle O\u2019Neil, and the deputy first minister were \u201cgenuinely committed\u201d to a new strategy but said women cannot wait for the time it will take for fully funded, joined-up systems to be put in place.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we call for a domestic abuse commissioner where there is oversight like they have in <a href=\"https://domesticabusecommissioner.uk/\">England and Wales</a>,\u201d McMullen said.</p> <p>She added: \u201cThere are women who are afraid to go home even though when you shut your front door you should be in the safest place in the world.

      "bodyText": "A leading women\u2019s rights charity has called for the establishment of a domestic abuse commissioner in Northern Ireland to tackle one of the highest rates of femicide in Europe. There is heightened concern that policies tackling domestic violence in Northern Ireland have been held back by decades of sectarian division sucking political resources. In Northern Ireland since 2020, 24 women have been violently killed, all but one by a man, with 41 confirmed femicides since 2017 \u2013 the third highest rate in Europe and the highest in the UK and the island of Ireland per capita. Among them were Mary Ward, a 22-year-old mother of one, who was found dead in her south Belfast home last month. She was the fourth woman to be allegedly murdered in six weeks, according to the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Campaigners have blamed the \u201cstop-start\u201d government in Northern Ireland, with the Stormont assembly suspended on at least eight occasions since it was formed in 1998 on the back of division between nationalists and unionists. Sonya McMullen, the regional services manager of Women\u2019s Aid Northern Ireland, said: \u201cIf you look at all the femicides in Ireland, 40% of those have been murdered in the north. We have a population of just 1.9 million compared to 5.15 million in the republic. So that is staggering to us.\u201d The charity is now calling on the Northern Ireland assembly to take action and develop a strategy that brings the region in line the rest of the UK. McMullen said the lack of legislative time on gender-based violence has meant Northern Ireland was last to bring in laws on domestic abuse, stalking and coercive control within relationships and laws on non-fatal strangulation. She added that deep-seated conservatism in Northern Ireland had led to a failure to adequately recognise women and girls as a disproportionate vulnerable category, unlike the rest of the UK. \u201cIn the North, everything was gender neutral. We had a first strategy to tackle violence in the home about 14 years ago but it was gender neutral. Nothing has been allowed to be specialised like it has in other parts of the country like England and Wales. Nothing was looked at through the gender lens,\u201d she said. \u201cThe whole structure here is not very good and it all goes back to the bloody troubles, of green versus orange. Unfortunately, it has held us back. We still don\u2019t even have domestic abuse protection orders and emergency provisions that the rest of the country have. \u201cIt is time for real action and strong leadership.\u201d She acknowledged that the first minister, Michelle O\u2019Neil, and the deputy first minister were \u201cgenuinely committed\u201d to a new strategy but said women cannot wait for the time it will take for fully funded, joined-up systems to be put in place. \u201cThat\u2019s why we call for a domestic abuse commissioner where there is oversight like they have in England and Wales,\u201d McMullen said. She added: \u201cThere are women who are afraid to go home even though when you shut your front door you should be in the safest place in the world. We are seeing women in refuges who were there as children. There is inter-generational abuse going on here. Will it take another murder to get action? Is that what it takes?\u201d Sorcha Eastwood, an MP for the Alliance party, has urged Labour to \u201cstart the conversation\u201d about the \u201cthrowaway misogyny\u201d on social media that she believes is fuelling a reversal of respect for women in real life among some boys and young men. Eastwood, the MP for Lagan Valley, believes the effect of social media on young boys and men is significant. \u201cIt really, really concerns me. We see it every day, even in schools where boys are coming in and saying really disturbing and inappropriate things to teachers, where girls are afraid to speak up,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is being normalised online. Clearly we now have a society where you have this sort of throwaway misogyny at one end that people seem to think they can get away with scot-free, to the top of the pyramid women losing their lives.

      "bodyText": "Well, here we are again. The last time an episode of Saturday Night Live followed the election of Donald Trump, it embarrassed itself by having Kate McKinnon play Leonard Cohen\u2019s Hallelujah while dressed as Hilary Clinton and offer a tearful vow to keep fighting. It looks like more of the same at the start of this episode, with the cast gathered on stage, solemnly addressing the audience about Trump\u2019s return to power and the lack of guardrails keeping him from taking revenge on his enemies. However, this is all a misdirect, as revealed when they collectively address Trump himself: \u201cWe \u2026 have been with you all along. We have never waivered in our support of you, even when others doubted you. Every single person on this stage believes in you. Every single person on this stage voted for you.\u201d James Austin Johnson shows up and debuts his new creation, \u201chot, jacked Trump\u201d, while Dana Carvey comes out as dancing, jumping buffoon Elon Musk, who brags about how he\u2019s \u201crunning the country now.\u201d (Maya Rudolph is nowhere to be found, which is probably for the best.) While this cold open is preferable to that godawful one from eight years ago, it\u2019s hard to take the disingenuousness as genuine: after all, SNL was more than happy to have both Trump and Musk host before, and well after their reprehensible natures were on full display. Bill Burr returns to host for the second time. The comic initially avoids talking about the election, jumping right into a standup routine about the flu and vaccines (\u201cIf you get it, you side with the evil pharmaceutical companies, if you don\u2019t you\u2019re aligned with people who don\u2019t wear shoes on an airplane\u201d). However, he eventually does crash right into the orange elephant in the room, putting the blame for the election\u2019s outcome squarely on women: \u201cYou\u2019re 0-2 against this guy \u2026 enough with the pantsuit, it\u2019s not working \u2026 you don\u2019t win the office on policy, you gotta whore it up a little! I know a lot of ugly women \u2013 feminists \u2013 don\u2019t want to hear this\u2026\u201d This is definitely not what a large percent of the show\u2019s audience wants to hear, and Burr struggles to get the live crowd on his side, although he mostly brings them around by the monologue\u2019s end. I expect the larger reaction across social media will be less forgiving. The first sketch takes place in a fire station, where a mental health expert runs a series of Rorschach tests to a group of macho firemen. Most of the guys just see everyday things like trees and butterflies, but Burr\u2019s firefighter sees sexualized drawings of cartoon characters, such as the hero of Monsters Inc in wedding lingerie \u201cgrabbing onto his little green ass\u201d, Olaf from Frozen running away with Elsa\u2019s top, a jacked Snoopy wearing a red speedo and \u201cwalking Charlie Brown like he\u2019s his dog\u201d. The drawings of these scenarios are funny, but it\u2019s the specificity of each that get the biggest laughs. A commercial for Buffalo Wild Wings sees football fans having Sunday fun at the chain restaurant, save for Burr\u2019s angry, miserable Patriots fan. He complains about his wife (\u201c[she] says I bring tension to the house\u201d) and his lot in life (\u201cI was born white 50 years too late\u201d), before getting into a fist fight with his grown son in front of his young granddaughter. A solid portrait of a certain type of douchebag (Dave Portnoy popping up on the guy\u2019s phone screen is a nice touch). Then, Burr\u2019s blue-collar father teaches his son about 80s sex rock by way of a greatest hits CD of his favorite band, Snake Skin, \u201cthree mid-40s Jewish guys from Long Island singing about slamming nah-nah\u201d. The cuts to the band\u2019s live performances and Burr\u2019s stilted performance give this one a janky feel. The Janitor is a parody of Good Will Hunting.

That\u2019s just not true.</p> <p>\u201cI think [Mr Farage] should focus on working with his constituents in Clacton who deserve a bit of a full-time MP as opposed to a transatlantic commentator.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, the UK\u2019s chief of the defence staff, Adm Sir Tony Radakin, said Russia was still paying an \u201cextraordinary price\u201d for Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion and October was the worst month for losses since the conflict began in February 2022.</p> <p>\u201cRussia is about to suffer 700,000 people killed or wounded \u2013 the enormous pain and suffering that the Russian nation is having to bear because of Putin\u2019s ambition,\u201d he told BBC One\u2019s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme, adding that the only gains were \u201ctiny increments of land\u201d.</p> <p>The cost of the war, which he put at more than 40% of public expenditure on defence and security, was also \u201can enormous drain\u201d on Russia.</p> <p>Jones said a target to be reached for defence spending would be announced but needed to wait for the strategic defence review.</p> <p>He told Sky News: \u201cToday, we\u2019re spending 2.3%. The question is how you spend that but defending the country is a non-negotiable. That is not a trade-off; the trade-off is then with other areas of public spending. Now, are we defending the country today? Absolutely we are. Do we want to make sure we\u2019re hitting our Nato obligations? Absolutely we do.</p> <p>\u201cBut the strategic defence review will start to answer some of the questions, which is beyond that \u2013 what more does the UK want to offer as part of our global alliances? And that\u2019s where you start.\u201d</p>",

During the US election campaign, Trump said he would find a solution to end the war \u201cwithin a day\u201d, but did not explain how he would do so. His vice-president nominee, JD Vance, has been vociferously opposed to providing more funds to support Ukraine. Jones said the UK would not be stepping back from its own commitments. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any countenance of the idea that we\u2019re stepping back from that. That\u2019s why we\u2019re offering them \u00a33bn a year, which you know, in the fiscal context here in the UK, is difficult but the right decision for us,\u201d he said. \u201cOfficials will be considering and planning lots of different scenarios \u2013 as they would do under any administration \u2013 to make sure that the UK is in the strongest possible position.\u201d However, Jones said he would not commit to spending 2.5% of GDP on defence by the end of the current parliament, saying that security and defence were a priority but that meant \u201ctrade-offs\u201d in other areas. Jones was also scathing about the Reform UK leader Nigel Farage\u2019s offer to help the Labour government work with Donald Trump, saying: \u201cThe counterfactual here is that we do not have influence and we do not have relationships. That\u2019s just not true. \u201cI think [Mr Farage] should focus on working with his constituents in Clacton who deserve a bit of a full-time MP as opposed to a transatlantic commentator.\u201d Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, the UK\u2019s chief of the defence staff, Adm Sir Tony Radakin, said Russia was still paying an \u201cextraordinary price\u201d for Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion and October was the worst month for losses since the conflict began in February 2022. \u201cRussia is about to suffer 700,000 people killed or wounded \u2013 the enormous pain and suffering that the Russian nation is having to bear because of Putin\u2019s ambition,\u201d he told BBC One\u2019s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme, adding that the only gains were \u201ctiny increments of land\u201d. The cost of the war, which he put at more than 40% of public expenditure on defence and security, was also \u201can enormous drain\u201d on Russia. Jones said a target to be reached for defence spending would be announced but needed to wait for the strategic defence review. He told Sky News: \u201cToday, we\u2019re spending 2.3%. The question is how you spend that but defending the country is a non-negotiable. That is not a trade-off; the trade-off is then with other areas of public spending. Now, are we defending the country today? Absolutely we are. Do we want to make sure we\u2019re hitting our Nato obligations? Absolutely we do. \u201cBut the strategic defence review will start to answer some of the questions, which is beyond that \u2013 what more does the UK want to offer as part of our global alliances? And that\u2019s where you start.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>There is no need to pick only a few of the many explanations of Donald Trump\u2019s political comeback. Most of the endless reasons we have heard over the past five days ring true: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/06/inflation-looks-to-have-secured-trump-win-but-his-policies-mean-higher-prices\">inflation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-election-win-global-trend-1982174\">incumbency</a>, a flimsy Democratic campaign, white Americans\u2019 seemingly eternal issues with race, and what one New York Times essayist recently called \u201ca <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/opinion/trump-white-young-men.html\">regressive idea of masculinity</a> in which power over women is a birthright\u201d. But there is another story that has so far been rather<strong> </strong>more overlooked, to do with how politics now works, and who voters think of when they enter the polling booth.</p> \n<p>Its most vivid element is about the left, and one inescapable fact: that a lot of people simply do not like us. In the UK, that is part of the reason why Brexit happened, why Nigel Farage is back, and why our new Labour government feels so flimsy and fragile. In the US, it goes some way to explaining why more than <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/election/2024/results/president?election-data-id=2024-PG&amp;election-painting-mode=projection-with-lead&amp;filter-key-races=false&amp;filter-flipped=false&amp;filter-remaining=false\">75 million voters</a> just rejected the supposedly progressive option, and chose a convicted criminal and unabashed insurrectionist to oversee their lives.</p> \n<p>The latter story goes beyond Kamala Harris and her failed pitch for power. When established parties on the progressive and conservative wings of politics go into an election, in the minds of many people, they represent a much larger set of forces, whether their candidates like it or not. After all, what people understand as the left and right operate far beyond the institutions of the state: political battles are fought in the media, on the street, in workplaces, campuses, and more. This has always been the case, but as social media turn the noise such activity makes into a deafening din, seeing most big parties and candidates as the tips of much larger icebergs becomes inevitable.</p> \n<p>Trump leads the movement that was responsible for the January 6 insurrection, has made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/03/the-proud-boys-are-a-far-right-gang-trump-boosted-them-on-national-tv\">less-than-subtle noises</a> about his affinity with the far right, and makes absolutely no bones about any of it. For the Democrats, the lines that connect a centrist figure such as Harris to the wider US left tend to look much fuzzier, but that does not make millions of people\u2019s perceptions of them any less real. Around the world, in fact, the left looks to many voters like a coherent bloc that goes from people who <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/equilibrium-sustainability/3258735-climate-change-protestors-briefly-shut-down-highway-in-dc/\">lie in the road</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/columbias-total-lockdown-protests-called-extreme-divisive-students-sta-rcna150078\">shut down universities</a> to would-be presidents and prime ministers \u2013 the only difference between them, as some see it, is that radical activists are honest about their ideas, whereas the people who stand for office try to cover them up.</p> \n<p>What the US election result shows is that, when told to make a choice, millions of people will draw on those ideas, and ally themselves with the other political side. Many of them, of course, have arrived at that conclusion thanks to outright bigotry. But given the remarkable spread of votes for Trump \u2013 into <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/6/us-election-2024-results-how-black-voters-shifted-towards-trump\">Latino and black parts of the electorate</a>, and states considered loyal Democratic heartlands, from <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/san-diego/2024/11/07/san-diego-county-swing-trump-presidential-election\">California</a> to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/06/new-jersey-swing-state-red-00187965\">New Jersey</a> \u2013 that hardly explains the entirety of his win. What it highlights is something that many American, British and European people have known for the past 15 years, at least: that the left is now alienating huge chunks of its old base of support.</p> \n<p>That story has deep roots, partly bound up with the decline of political loyalties based around class: compared with 2008, 2024\u2019s Democratic coalition was skewed towards the <a href=\"https://x.com/patrickjfl/status/1854645395856482568\">higher end of the income range</a>, whereas Trump\u2019s tilted in the other direction. The <a href=\"https://ukandeu.ac.uk/why-labour-can-no-longer-rely-on-the-ethnic-minority-vote/\">same kind of fracturing</a> now seems to be affecting many ethnically based political loyalties: as Trump well knows, there are now large numbers of voters from minorities \u2013 and immigrant backgrounds \u2013 who largely accept rightwing ideas about immigration. That is partly because modern economies create such a desperate competition for rewards.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f972f1fa-70a2-4db1-be05-8b7c4c040ba0\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NxgTaFQvauc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But there seems to be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/84b81600-d107-4050-80cf-1d1e276ea54d\">more to it than that</a>: polling shows the suggestion that \u201cgovernment should increase border security and enforcement\u201d is supported by higher percentages of black and Hispanic voters than among white progressives \u2013 but the same applies to \u201cmost people can make it if they work hard\u201d and \u201cAmerica is the greatest country in the world\u201d. Growing chunks of the electorate, in other words, are not who the left think they are.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the widening political gap based around people\u2019s education levels \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2024/11/06/election-demographic-breakdown-2024-harris-won-college-educated-vote-trump-gained-young-black-latino-voters/\">voters without college degrees</a> supported Trump by a 14-point margin, while Harris had a 13-point advantage among college-educated people \u2013 creates yet more problems. Some of them are to do with \u201cwokeness\u201d and its drawbacks. Because the cutting edge of left politics is often associated with institutions of higher education, ideas that are meant to be about inclusivity can easily turn into the opposite. The result is an agenda often expressed with a judgmental arrogance, and based around behavioural codes \u2013 to do with microaggressions, or the correct use of pronouns \u2013 that are very hard for people outside highly educated circles to navigate.</p> \n<p>At the same time, our online discourse hardens good intentions into an all-or-nothing style of activism that will not tolerate nuance or compromise. A message about the left then travels from one part of society to another: there is a transmission belt between clarion calls that do the rounds on college campuses, the Democratic mainstream, and unsettled voters in, say, suburban and rural Pennsylvania. And the right can therefore make hay, as evidenced by a Trump ad that was <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-anti-transgender-political-ads-are-dominating-the-airwaves-this-election\">crass and cruel</a>, but grimly effective: \u201cKamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\u201d</p> \n<p>In its own ugly way, that line highlights what might have been Trump and his supporters\u2019 strongest asset: the idea that, because they are so distant and privileged, modern progressives would rather ignore questions about everyday economics. Nearly <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alarming-39-americans-skipped-meals-120000123.html\">40% of all Americans</a> say they have skipped meals in order to meet their housing payments, and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/11/70percent-of-americans-feel-financially-stressed-new-cnbc-survey-finds.html\">more than 70%</a> admit to living with economic anxiety. A second Trump term, of course, is hardly going to make that any better: the point is that he was able to successfully pretend that it would.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/08/donald-trump-evidence-public-health-crisis-nato\">Think you know how bad Trump unleashed will be? Look at the evidence: it will be even worse | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>That then opened the way for something even more jaw-dropping: Trump\u2019s sudden claim to be a great unifier, something implicitly contrasted with progressives\u2019 habit of separating people into demographic islands. It takes an almost evil level of chutzpah to flip from his hate and nastiness to a new message of love for most Americans, but consider what he <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cze3yr77j9wo\">said</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cze3yr77j9wo\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cze3yr77j9wo\">about his coalition of voters</a>: \u201cThey came from all quarters: union, non-union, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, Arab American, Muslim American. We had everybody. And it was beautiful.\u201d That is the increasingly familiar sound of populist tanks being parked on the left\u2019s lawn.</p> \n<p>None of this is meant to imply that most progressive causes are mistaken, or to make any argument for leaning into Trumpism. What the state of politics across the west highlights is more about tone, strategy, empathy, and how to take people with you while trying to change society \u2013 as well as the platforms that poison democratic debate, and the harm they do to progressive politics. The next time you see someone on the left combusting with<strong> </strong>self-righteous fury on the hellscape now known as X, it\u2019s worth remembering that its current owner is Elon Musk, who may be about to assist Trump in <a href=\"https://thehill.com/business/4966789-elon-musk-skepticism-2-trillion-spending-cuts/https://thehill.com/business/4966789-elon-musk-skepticism-2-trillion-spending-cuts/\">massively cutting US public spending</a>, while cackling at the weakness of the president\u2019s enemies, and their habit of walking into glaring traps.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p></li> \n</ul>",

But given the remarkable spread of votes for Trump \u2013 into Latino and black parts of the electorate, and states considered loyal Democratic heartlands, from California to New Jersey \u2013 that hardly explains the entirety of his win. What it highlights is something that many American, British and European people have known for the past 15 years, at least: that the left is now alienating huge chunks of its old base of support. That story has deep roots, partly bound up with the decline of political loyalties based around class: compared with 2008, 2024\u2019s Democratic coalition was skewed towards the higher end of the income range, whereas Trump\u2019s tilted in the other direction. The same kind of fracturing now seems to be affecting many ethnically based political loyalties: as Trump well knows, there are now large numbers of voters from minorities \u2013 and immigrant backgrounds \u2013 who largely accept rightwing ideas about immigration. That is partly because modern economies create such a desperate competition for rewards. But there seems to be more to it than that: polling shows the suggestion that \u201cgovernment should increase border security and enforcement\u201d is supported by higher percentages of black and Hispanic voters than among white progressives \u2013 but the same applies to \u201cmost people can make it if they work hard\u201d and \u201cAmerica is the greatest country in the world\u201d. Growing chunks of the electorate, in other words, are not who the left think they are. Meanwhile, the widening political gap based around people\u2019s education levels \u2013 voters without college degrees supported Trump by a 14-point margin, while Harris had a 13-point advantage among college-educated people \u2013 creates yet more problems. Some of them are to do with \u201cwokeness\u201d and its drawbacks. Because the cutting edge of left politics is often associated with institutions of higher education, ideas that are meant to be about inclusivity can easily turn into the opposite. The result is an agenda often expressed with a judgmental arrogance, and based around behavioural codes \u2013 to do with microaggressions, or the correct use of pronouns \u2013 that are very hard for people outside highly educated circles to navigate. At the same time, our online discourse hardens good intentions into an all-or-nothing style of activism that will not tolerate nuance or compromise. A message about the left then travels from one part of society to another: there is a transmission belt between clarion calls that do the rounds on college campuses, the Democratic mainstream, and unsettled voters in, say, suburban and rural Pennsylvania. And the right can therefore make hay, as evidenced by a Trump ad that was crass and cruel, but grimly effective: \u201cKamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\u201d In its own ugly way, that line highlights what might have been Trump and his supporters\u2019 strongest asset: the idea that, because they are so distant and privileged, modern progressives would rather ignore questions about everyday economics. Nearly 40% of all Americans say they have skipped meals in order to meet their housing payments, and more than 70% admit to living with economic anxiety. A second Trump term, of course, is hardly going to make that any better: the point is that he was able to successfully pretend that it would. That then opened the way for something even more jaw-dropping: Trump\u2019s sudden claim to be a great unifier, something implicitly contrasted with progressives\u2019 habit of separating people into demographic islands. It takes an almost evil level of chutzpah to flip from his hate and nastiness to a new message of love for most Americans, but consider what he said about his coalition of voters: \u201cThey came from all quarters: union, non-union, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, Arab American, Muslim American. We had everybody. And it was beautiful.\u201d That is the increasingly familiar sound of populist tanks being parked on the left\u2019s lawn. None of this is meant to imply that most progressive causes are mistaken, or to make any argument for leaning into Trumpism. What the state of politics across the west highlights is more about tone, strategy, empathy, and how to take people with you while trying to change society \u2013 as well as the platforms that poison democratic debate, and the harm they do to progressive politics. The next time you see someone on the left combusting with self-righteous fury on the hellscape now known as X, it\u2019s worth remembering that its current owner is Elon Musk, who may be about to assist Trump in massively cutting US public spending, while cackling at the weakness of the president\u2019s enemies, and their habit of walking into glaring traps.

      "body": "<p>Following Donald Trump\u2019s decisive victory in this week\u2019s presidential election, leaders of the anti-war group Uncommitted National Movement expressed their disappointment over the results, highlighting the Democratic party\u2019s failure to listen to its base and prioritize progressive policies. Since the movement formed last winter, its leaders have urged the Democratic party to heed their demands of a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and to adopt an arms embargo on Israel, or risk losing their votes.</p> <p>While a full picture of how Arab and Muslim Americans voted in the presidential election is still being captured, this election showed a shift among communities that had long formed the Democratic base. A majority of Muslim Americans voted for the Green party candidate Jill Stein at 53%, according to a <a href=\"https://www.cair.com/press_releases/cair-exit-poll-of-muslim-voters-reveals-surge-in-support-for-jill-stein-and-donald-trump-steep-decline-for-harris/\">nationwide exit poll </a>of more than 1,500 Muslim Americans by the civil rights group Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), followed by 21% for Trump and 20% for vice-president Kamala Harris.</p> <p>In Michigan, which has one of the nation\u2019s highest Arab American and Muslim populations, 59% of Muslim Americans voted for Stein, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cair.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CAIR_2024_MI_Exit_Poll.jpg\">CAIR poll</a>, while 22% cast ballots for Trump and 14% supported Harris. While exit poll data on Arab American voters is not yet available, a <a href=\"https://www.aaiusa.org/library/the-arab-american-vote-2024\">September</a> poll for the non-profit group Arab American Institute found that they were evenly split between their support of Trump and Harris at 42% and 41% respectively.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/24/michigan-democrats-failed-gaza-voices-from-the-swing-states\">Here in Michigan, we know the Democrats have failed on Gaza \u2013 and they\u2019ll pay dearly for it | Mona Mawari</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now, Uncommitted\u2019s founders and supporters say that the election results reveal that the Democratic party has lost touch with its working class and anti-war voters. Their message for the Biden-Harris administration and Trump is clear, said Uncommitted leader and Palestinian American activist Lexis Zeidan: the movement is not over. While organizing for Palestinian rights under a Trump presidency will be an uphill battle, leaders said, they plan to continue mobilizing activists to apply pressure on the US government until it ends its support of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, where <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker\">more than 43,000 Palestinians</a> have been killed in Israeli attacks since last October.</p> <p>\u201cThe results of the election are really unfortunate because, with Trump taking office, there\u2019s a reality that domestically, policies are going to get worse, and people\u2019s rights are at stake. And we know also for Palestine and the Middle East, it\u2019s not going to get any better. It definitely didn\u2019t have to be this way,\u201d said Zeidan. \u201cDems could have been much smarter, much more strategic and they chose to stick with the status quo rather than listening to their base of voters.\u201d</p> <p>The Uncommitted National Movement spread to more than two dozen states in the spring, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/26/uncommitted-voters-harris-israel-gaza\">more than 700,000 citizens</a> marked their ballots \u201cuncommitted\u201d, or its equivalent, in state primaries to send a message to Joe Biden that he would lose their support if he didn\u2019t push for a permanent ceasefire.

      "bodyText": "Following Donald Trump\u2019s decisive victory in this week\u2019s presidential election, leaders of the anti-war group Uncommitted National Movement expressed their disappointment over the results, highlighting the Democratic party\u2019s failure to listen to its base and prioritize progressive policies. Since the movement formed last winter, its leaders have urged the Democratic party to heed their demands of a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and to adopt an arms embargo on Israel, or risk losing their votes. While a full picture of how Arab and Muslim Americans voted in the presidential election is still being captured, this election showed a shift among communities that had long formed the Democratic base. A majority of Muslim Americans voted for the Green party candidate Jill Stein at 53%, according to a nationwide exit poll of more than 1,500 Muslim Americans by the civil rights group Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), followed by 21% for Trump and 20% for vice-president Kamala Harris. In Michigan, which has one of the nation\u2019s highest Arab American and Muslim populations, 59% of Muslim Americans voted for Stein, according to the CAIR poll, while 22% cast ballots for Trump and 14% supported Harris. While exit poll data on Arab American voters is not yet available, a September poll for the non-profit group Arab American Institute found that they were evenly split between their support of Trump and Harris at 42% and 41% respectively. Now, Uncommitted\u2019s founders and supporters say that the election results reveal that the Democratic party has lost touch with its working class and anti-war voters. Their message for the Biden-Harris administration and Trump is clear, said Uncommitted leader and Palestinian American activist Lexis Zeidan: the movement is not over. While organizing for Palestinian rights under a Trump presidency will be an uphill battle, leaders said, they plan to continue mobilizing activists to apply pressure on the US government until it ends its support of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, where more than 43,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks since last October. \u201cThe results of the election are really unfortunate because, with Trump taking office, there\u2019s a reality that domestically, policies are going to get worse, and people\u2019s rights are at stake. And we know also for Palestine and the Middle East, it\u2019s not going to get any better. It definitely didn\u2019t have to be this way,\u201d said Zeidan. \u201cDems could have been much smarter, much more strategic and they chose to stick with the status quo rather than listening to their base of voters.\u201d The Uncommitted National Movement spread to more than two dozen states in the spring, when more than 700,000 citizens marked their ballots \u201cuncommitted\u201d, or its equivalent, in state primaries to send a message to Joe Biden that he would lose their support if he didn\u2019t push for a permanent ceasefire. It followed a campaign called Listen to Michigan, which encouraged more than 100,000 voters to vote \u201cuncommitted\u201d during the state\u2019s Democratic primary in February. Thirty uncommitted delegates were sent to the Democratic national convention (DNC) over the summer. Discontent over the US\u2019s handling of the war on Gaza was behind the Arab American community\u2019s historic shift from being reliably Democrat to voting Republican and third party in this election, said Tariq Habash, a former policy advisor for the Biden administration who resigned due to the US\u2019s policy regarding Gaza.

And I think that resonated with voters in a way that Democrats were not able to turn out the people who they normally would rely on to help them win elections.\u201d While the Democratic party did not meet Uncommitted\u2019s demands, including to allow a Palestinian American to speak at the DNC, Habash sees the movement as successful for its grassroots mobilization of hundreds of thousands of people and for shining a light on the Democratic party\u2019s shortcomings. The movement\u2019s leaders were split on their voting plan for the top of the ticket. In September, the Uncommitted declined to endorse Harris after her campaign failed to meet with Palestinian families or Uncommitted representatives ahead of the group\u2019s deadline. The movement also abstained from endorsing a third party candidate, saying that casting a ballot for one was tantamount to a vote for Trump. Zeidan abstained from voting for a presidential candidate and otherwise voted along Democratic party lines down the ballot, while the co-founder and uncommitted Michigan delegate Abbas Alawieh backed Harris. Several days before the election, some members of the movement formed an offshoot group called Uncommitted Grassroots to encourage voters to support a third party candidate. \u201cOver the last few months, a small group of individuals have made decisions on behalf of our nationwide movement. These individuals, without consulting our broader coalition and without being democratically chosen, changed the way that the movement operated from one that challenged the Democratic party to one that completely catered to the party\u2019s needs at the DNC,\u201d Uncommitted Grassroots wrote in a statement. \u201cThis was a betrayal of the true voice and core values of the countless uncommitted voters who believe that compromising on the values of peace and justice is non-negotiable.\u201d In response, the Uncommitted leaders said that they had always been clear that the movement was for Democratic voters seeking to prevent a Trump presidency. \u201cIf our strategy had been to abandon organizing within the Democratic Party,\u201d they wrote on X, \u201cwe would have taken that path from the start rather than investing in the Democratic Party.\u201d Zeidan said that she understands the anger and frustration of Arab and Muslim American voters who cast ballots for Trump after their pleas to Biden for a ceasefire were ignored. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said, \u201cis why the Democratic leadership didn\u2019t listen to them.\u201d For Alawieh, the US\u2019s violent and harmful Gaza policy crosses party lines. \u201cFor those of us who are experiencing this policy violence and trying to make sense of how to respond politically, I think it is totally understandable for us to arrive at different conclusions about what the politically savvy thing might be to do,\u201d Alawieh said. \u201cIndeed, both parties are diametrically opposed to a pro-peace and pro-justice approach to the issue of Israel and Palestine.\u201d Zeidan did not provide specific details on the group\u2019s next steps, but she said that the movement plans to continue organizing around Palestinian liberation and applying pressure on the Biden-Harris administration ahead of Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cMy hope is that this election is the clear demarcation for the Democratic party,\u201d Zeidan said, \u201cto begin to realign on what their party stands for.\u201d Erum Salam contributed reporting.",

      "body": "<p>In 1974, Herv\u00e9 Guibert, a precocious 18-year-old fledgling artist, asked his great-aunts, Suzanne and Louise, if he could make a film about them. The pair lived a life of reclusive eccentricity in a Parisian <em>h\u00f4tel particulier</em> (grand urban house) in the 15th arrondissement alongside a pampered German shepherd guard dog called Whysky. Though Guibert was one of their very few regular visitors, they dismissed his suggestion outright. Undaunted, he wrote a play based on their life \u2013 it was never produced \u2013 and took hundreds of photographs of them, mostly from across the table at their regular lunches.</p> <p>\u201cEverything began to take off when I began to print some photos just to see, to show them,\u201d he recalls in a passage from <em><a href=\"https://magichour.press/books/coming-soon-suzanne-and-louise-by-herv-guibert\">Suzanne and Louise</a></em>, a <em>roman-photo</em> (photo novel) that first appeared in a French edition in 1980 and is about to be published for the first time in English. Surprised and flattered by what they saw, the sisters agreed to be the subjects of a more ambitious project in which Guibert required them to pose more formally and even act out vignettes that reflected their intertwined lives.</p>    <p>In her illuminating introduction to the new edition, the New York-based artist and photographer Moyra Davey describes it as a \u201cgothic novella in pictures, in which the artist, using subterfuge and epistolary seduction, bewitches his shrewd aunts into compliance\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>He\u2019s always flirting with transgression, if not deploying it outright</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That about nails it, but does not quite prepare the reader for the sometimes disturbing dance of words and images that captures the complex psychological dynamic of the sisters\u2019 day-to-day existence \u2013 and Guibert\u2019s provocative role in bringing it to light. Occasionally, Guibert refers to himself in the third person, as though acknowledging his role as a crucial, if invisible, character in the strange familial narrative. \u201cThey don\u2019t speak to each other, except when he comes to see them, every Sunday,\u201d he writes. \u201cThey don\u2019t ask him a single question about his life or his work, but speak to each other across him. They perform, for him, a dramatisation of their relationship. They seduce him; they are jealous. He keeps quiet and listens. They are amazed by the interest he shows in them, flattered, amorous.\u201d</p>    <p>Even without Guibert\u2019s slyly manipulative authorial presence, they are quite a pair, their claustrophobic relationship a study in control and acquiescence. \u201cSuzanne, the older one, is the one with money,\u201d writes Guibert in his tantalisingly scene-setting prologue. \u201cLouise, her sister, the former Carmelite, serves as her humble, tyrannical maid. Suzanne tells tales of stinginess, of remembrance, of suffering \u2026 Louise tells tales of drunkenness, asceticism, death.\u201d Their intertwined lives are, as Guibert puts it, \u201cordered by a terrible, calculated precision. Nothing must upset their routine.\u201d Which, ironically, is exactly what he does.</p> <p>Herv\u00e9 Guibert is a difficult artist to pin down. Born into a middle-class family in Saint-Cloud, a suburb in the west of Paris, he worked fitfully as an actor and film-maker before becoming a columnist for the French newspaper <em>Le Monde</em> in the late 1970s. Alongside <em>Suzanne and Louise</em>, he wrote critical essays, screenplays, pamphlets and intimately autobiographical novels that are now seen as forerunners of today\u2019s fashionable autofiction genre. <em>My Parents</em> gleefully relates some scandalous incidents from his family\u2019s past and recounts in often excruciating detail his pampered upbringing. Another novel, <em>Crazy For Vincent</em>, traces his passionate obsession with a drug-taking skateboarder who was just 15 when they first met. His work, once considered too edgy and explicit in its depiction of his homosexuality, has garnered him a new audience among younger readers who are drawn to his shapeshifting prose that moves fluently between genres and styles.</p> <p>\u201cI think Guibert abjured traditional narrative,\u201d says Davey. \u201cHe preferred the messiness of things not adding up, not circling back. In his diary he actually mentions privileging the \u2018botched\u2019 novel over the \u2018banality\u2019 of success.\u201d</p> <p>Guibert\u2019s most notorious book, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/to-the-friend-who-did-not-save-my-life-9781788168397\">To the Friend Who Did Not Save My Life</a></em>, features a narrator who describes his experience of being diagnosed with Aids following the death of his close friend Muzil. It became a bestseller in France partly due to the scandal that ensued when reviewers realised that the character of Muzil was based on the French philosopher Michel Foucault, with whom Guibert had had a relationship. In characteristically cavalier fashion, Guibert also revealed Foucault had died of Aids-related complications rather than cancer. Transgressively intimate and fragmentary in style, the narrative moves between humour, horror and visceral truth-telling.</p>    <p><em>Suzanne and Louise</em> is of a different order; more mischievous, but not without an undertone of moral ambiguity. At one point, he communicates clandestinely with Suzanne as if he is her suitor: \u201cThe letter I might write you could be indecent: it would be a love letter. It feels like you speak to me, and that I speak to you, that we communicate better than we do with words, through these photographs \u2026 \u201d Her knowing reply \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should treat your letter as a prank or an exercise in style\u201d \u2013 is almost a distillation of Guibert\u2019s approach.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d say he is being playful and provocative,\u201d says Davey, \u201cand seeing to what limits he can push this woman, who is 60 years his senior and born in the previous century. He\u2019s always flirting with transgression, if not deploying it outright.\u201d</p> <p>For Davey, <em>Suzanne and Louise</em> is \u201ca prized rarity\u201d among Guibert\u2019s many publications \u2013 \u201chis only monograph where his full gifts as an image-maker and as a writer combine\u201d. Among the small canon of acclaimed photo novels such as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2011/feb/10/love-on-left-bank-in-pictures\">Love on the Left Bank</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2011/feb/10/love-on-left-bank-in-pictures\"> </a>by Ed van der Elsken and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/30/sweet-flypaper-of-life-roy-decarava-langston-hughes-review\">The Sweet Flypaper of Life</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/30/sweet-flypaper-of-life-roy-decarava-langston-hughes-review\"> </a>by Roy DeCarava and Langston Hughes, <em>Suzanne and Louise</em> is a singularly strange and compelling object.</p>    <p>The images move back and forth between the quietly observational and the artfully staged, from the intimate to the unsettling. In one series, made after their dog Whysky has been put down, Louise reluctantly agrees to don his leather muzzle for a photo session. \u201cAs soon as I started taking the photograph,\u201d Guibert writes, \u201cshe concentrated intensely, her entire body changed, and she started to croon, faintly, under her breath, \u2018I am the poor dog, I am the poor dog \u2026 \u2019\u201d</p> <p>The strange triangular drama becomes even stranger with a morbidly mischievous \u201csimulacrum\u201d of Suzanne\u2019s death in which the merging of provocation and black humour becomes truly surreal. \u201cI cover her entire body with a white blanket. Louise, barefoot, kneels at the end of the sofa. She tries to lift the corpse by gripping it by the hands, pulling it by the feet. They both laugh.\u201d</p>    <p><em>Suzanne and Louise</em> was published the same year as <em>Camera Lucida</em> by Roland Barthes \u2013 another friend of Guibert\u2019s \u2013 in which the philosopher meditates on the essential relationship between photographs and mortality. Guibert died, aged 36, in 1991, the same year that Suzanne passed away. During his final months, he recorded his daily life as he struggled with Aids, and the resulting film, <em>La Pudeur ou l\u2019Impudeur</em><em> (Modesty and Shame)</em>, was broadcast after his death on French television. Louise died in 1998. In a copy of the book they both signed for Guibert, Suzanne wrote: \u201cTo our very dear \u2018grand-nephew\u2019 Herve\u0301, in admiration for having pulled from our obscurity this book, which is too brilliant for our modesty.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Suzanne and Louise</em> by Herv\u00e9 Guibert, translated by Christine Pichini, is published in the \u200bUS on 19 November and the UK on 2 January by Magic Hour Press.

They are amazed by the interest he shows in them, flattered, amorous.\u201d Even without Guibert\u2019s slyly manipulative authorial presence, they are quite a pair, their claustrophobic relationship a study in control and acquiescence. \u201cSuzanne, the older one, is the one with money,\u201d writes Guibert in his tantalisingly scene-setting prologue. \u201cLouise, her sister, the former Carmelite, serves as her humble, tyrannical maid. Suzanne tells tales of stinginess, of remembrance, of suffering \u2026 Louise tells tales of drunkenness, asceticism, death.\u201d Their intertwined lives are, as Guibert puts it, \u201cordered by a terrible, calculated precision. Nothing must upset their routine.\u201d Which, ironically, is exactly what he does. Herv\u00e9 Guibert is a difficult artist to pin down. Born into a middle-class family in Saint-Cloud, a suburb in the west of Paris, he worked fitfully as an actor and film-maker before becoming a columnist for the French newspaper Le Monde in the late 1970s. Alongside Suzanne and Louise, he wrote critical essays, screenplays, pamphlets and intimately autobiographical novels that are now seen as forerunners of today\u2019s fashionable autofiction genre. My Parents gleefully relates some scandalous incidents from his family\u2019s past and recounts in often excruciating detail his pampered upbringing. Another novel, Crazy For Vincent, traces his passionate obsession with a drug-taking skateboarder who was just 15 when they first met. His work, once considered too edgy and explicit in its depiction of his homosexuality, has garnered him a new audience among younger readers who are drawn to his shapeshifting prose that moves fluently between genres and styles. \u201cI think Guibert abjured traditional narrative,\u201d says Davey. \u201cHe preferred the messiness of things not adding up, not circling back. In his diary he actually mentions privileging the \u2018botched\u2019 novel over the \u2018banality\u2019 of success.\u201d Guibert\u2019s most notorious book, To the Friend Who Did Not Save My Life, features a narrator who describes his experience of being diagnosed with Aids following the death of his close friend Muzil. It became a bestseller in France partly due to the scandal that ensued when reviewers realised that the character of Muzil was based on the French philosopher Michel Foucault, with whom Guibert had had a relationship. In characteristically cavalier fashion, Guibert also revealed Foucault had died of Aids-related complications rather than cancer. Transgressively intimate and fragmentary in style, the narrative moves between humour, horror and visceral truth-telling. Suzanne and Louise is of a different order; more mischievous, but not without an undertone of moral ambiguity. At one point, he communicates clandestinely with Suzanne as if he is her suitor: \u201cThe letter I might write you could be indecent: it would be a love letter. It feels like you speak to me, and that I speak to you, that we communicate better than we do with words, through these photographs \u2026 \u201d Her knowing reply \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should treat your letter as a prank or an exercise in style\u201d \u2013 is almost a distillation of Guibert\u2019s approach. \u201cI\u2019d say he is being playful and provocative,\u201d says Davey, \u201cand seeing to what limits he can push this woman, who is 60 years his senior and born in the previous century. He\u2019s always flirting with transgression, if not deploying it outright.\u201d For Davey, Suzanne and Louise is \u201ca prized rarity\u201d among Guibert\u2019s many publications \u2013 \u201chis only monograph where his full gifts as an image-maker and as a writer combine\u201d. Among the small canon of acclaimed photo novels such as Love on the Left Bank by Ed van der Elsken and The Sweet Flypaper of Life by Roy DeCarava and Langston Hughes, Suzanne and Louise is a singularly strange and compelling object. The images move back and forth between the quietly observational and the artfully staged, from the intimate to the unsettling. In one series, made after their dog Whysky has been put down, Louise reluctantly agrees to don his leather muzzle for a photo session. \u201cAs soon as I started taking the photograph,\u201d Guibert writes, \u201cshe concentrated intensely, her entire body changed, and she started to croon, faintly, under her breath, \u2018I am the poor dog, I am the poor dog \u2026 \u2019\u201d The strange triangular drama becomes even stranger with a morbidly mischievous \u201csimulacrum\u201d of Suzanne\u2019s death in which the merging of provocation and black humour becomes truly surreal. \u201cI cover her entire body with a white blanket. Louise, barefoot, kneels at the end of the sofa. She tries to lift the corpse by gripping it by the hands, pulling it by the feet. They both laugh.\u201d Suzanne and Louise was published the same year as Camera Lucida by Roland Barthes \u2013 another friend of Guibert\u2019s \u2013 in which the philosopher meditates on the essential relationship between photographs and mortality. Guibert died, aged 36, in 1991, the same year that Suzanne passed away. During his final months, he recorded his daily life as he struggled with Aids, and the resulting film, La Pudeur ou l\u2019Impudeur (Modesty and Shame), was broadcast after his death on French television. Louise died in 1998. In a copy of the book they both signed for Guibert, Suzanne wrote: \u201cTo our very dear \u2018grand-nephew\u2019 Herve\u0301, in admiration for having pulled from our obscurity this book, which is too brilliant for our modesty.\u201d Suzanne and Louise by Herv\u00e9 Guibert, translated by Christine Pichini, is published in the US on 19 November and the UK on 2 January by Magic Hour Press.

Yet there is one issue that never seems to be heard in the annual debate that now marks this solemn occasion: while Britain fought the second world war to defeat Nazi Germany, putting its own existence as a free country at stake, it denied freedom to its colonies.</p> <p>Winston Churchill made no secret of his belief that \u201ccoloured\u201d people had no right to be free. In August 1941, in Placentia Bay, Newfoundland, he signed with the US president Franklin D Roosevelt the Atlantic charter which asserted \u201cthe right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live\u201d. This was hailed as a great war aim of the allies. Yet on his return, Churchill told the House of Commons that this was not \u201capplicable to coloured races in colonial empire\u201d but only to the states and nations of Europe. </p> <p>Later during the war, Roosevelt raised the question of colonial trusteeship as a prelude to freedom for the colonies, but Churchill responded, \u201cNothing would be taken away from the British empire without a war.\u201d</p> <p>What makes the silence on this issue now very surprising is that both before and during the second world war, the question of colonies being denied freedom was often raised. Nobody did it more eloquently than George Orwell.</p> <p>Just before the start of the war, with much talk of how to fight fascism, Orwell laid into an argument by the American writer Clarence K Streit, who said that the way to do so was for 15 democracies of Europe and the US, which Streit listed, to unite and form a common government. Orwell wrote, \u201cWhat it smells of, as usual, is hypocrisy and self-righteousness.\u201d Orwell pointed out that countries such as the UK, France, Belgium and the Netherlands considered their colonies to be dependencies whose resources were available to the \u201cdemocracies\u201d, but whose \u201ccoloured inhabitants\u201d lacked \u201cthe right to vote\u201d. Despite, he argued, India containing \u201cmore inhabitants than the whole of the \u201815 democracies\u2019 put together\u201d.</p> <p>Many in the higher reaches of the British government brushed aside the argument that they were being hypocritical. Orwell and others campaigned during the war for India to be put on par with Australia, New Zealand and other white colonies, which had long been given their freedom, but he could not change their mind.</p> <p>Instead, when Mahatma Gandhi and other leaders of the Indian freedom movement pointed out the hypocrisy of the British war aims they were jailed, spending much of the war in British prisons. Gandhi was in jail when he heard that his wife had died.</p> <p>The British government, who worried about the effect this double standard may have on US opinion, asked propagandist Beverley Nichols to <a href=\"https://www.historytoday.com/hatred-hindus\">write a book</a> denouncing Gandhi. Before the war, Nichols had made speeches for the Hitler Youth, described Oswald Mosley, the leader of the British Union of Fascists, as the man to unite the country and prevent war, and even after Dunkirk, impressed by Hitler\u2019s \u201cappeal to reason\u201d speech, felt a peace deal with Nazi Germany could be done.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/08/wear-white-poppy-remembrance-days-staged-fervour-little-honour-my-grandad\">Why do I wear a white poppy? Because Remembrance Day\u2019s staged fervour does little to honour my grandad | Phineas Harper</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Verdict on India<em>,</em> Nichols compared Gandhi to Hitler, writing: \u201cThe German Heil Hitler has a striking equivalent in the Indian Gandhiji \u2026 The resemblances between Gandhi and Hitler are, of course, legion.\u201d Churchill recommend the book to his wife saying, \u201cIt is written with some distinction and a great deal of thought.\u201d </p> <p>When in 1942 a revolt broke out in India after Gandhi famously called for the British to leave through the Quit India movement, it required all the armed might of the Raj to surpress it, with policemen and soldiers opening fire 369 times, killing about 1,000 Indians and injuring 2,000. The RAF bombed rebel territories six times, the Whipping Act was reintroduced, and collective punishment imposed. In March 1943, General Lockhart wrote that India was now \u201can occupied and hostile country\u201d.</p> <p>Indians did fight for the allies, with more than 2.5 million joining the Indian army, the largest volunteer force in history, with 90,000 killed or maimed. But, as the historian Richard Overy writes: \u201cBritain compelled India to pay for its role in the war, forcing the Indian government to run a large annual deficit from an economy that could ill afford the cost, and to accept sharp increases in taxation for the Indian population\u201d, calling it \u201ceffectively a form of economic coercion\u201d.</p> <p>Now, nearly 80 years later, with so much on the war continuing to emerge through books, films, plays and <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-soldiers-that-saved-britain\">documentaries</a>, surely this is one subject the British should no longer shy away from discussing. If it isn\u2019t talked about, the divide between how people in Britain see the war and how those in the former colonies see it will continue to grow, preventing a full understanding of history.

Yet on his return, Churchill told the House of Commons that this was not \u201capplicable to coloured races in colonial empire\u201d but only to the states and nations of Europe. Later during the war, Roosevelt raised the question of colonial trusteeship as a prelude to freedom for the colonies, but Churchill responded, \u201cNothing would be taken away from the British empire without a war.\u201d What makes the silence on this issue now very surprising is that both before and during the second world war, the question of colonies being denied freedom was often raised. Nobody did it more eloquently than George Orwell. Just before the start of the war, with much talk of how to fight fascism, Orwell laid into an argument by the American writer Clarence K Streit, who said that the way to do so was for 15 democracies of Europe and the US, which Streit listed, to unite and form a common government. Orwell wrote, \u201cWhat it smells of, as usual, is hypocrisy and self-righteousness.\u201d Orwell pointed out that countries such as the UK, France, Belgium and the Netherlands considered their colonies to be dependencies whose resources were available to the \u201cdemocracies\u201d, but whose \u201ccoloured inhabitants\u201d lacked \u201cthe right to vote\u201d. Despite, he argued, India containing \u201cmore inhabitants than the whole of the \u201815 democracies\u2019 put together\u201d. Many in the higher reaches of the British government brushed aside the argument that they were being hypocritical. Orwell and others campaigned during the war for India to be put on par with Australia, New Zealand and other white colonies, which had long been given their freedom, but he could not change their mind. Instead, when Mahatma Gandhi and other leaders of the Indian freedom movement pointed out the hypocrisy of the British war aims they were jailed, spending much of the war in British prisons. Gandhi was in jail when he heard that his wife had died. The British government, who worried about the effect this double standard may have on US opinion, asked propagandist Beverley Nichols to write a book denouncing Gandhi. Before the war, Nichols had made speeches for the Hitler Youth, described Oswald Mosley, the leader of the British Union of Fascists, as the man to unite the country and prevent war, and even after Dunkirk, impressed by Hitler\u2019s \u201cappeal to reason\u201d speech, felt a peace deal with Nazi Germany could be done. In Verdict on India, Nichols compared Gandhi to Hitler, writing: \u201cThe German Heil Hitler has a striking equivalent in the Indian Gandhiji \u2026 The resemblances between Gandhi and Hitler are, of course, legion.\u201d Churchill recommend the book to his wife saying, \u201cIt is written with some distinction and a great deal of thought.\u201d When in 1942 a revolt broke out in India after Gandhi famously called for the British to leave through the Quit India movement, it required all the armed might of the Raj to surpress it, with policemen and soldiers opening fire 369 times, killing about 1,000 Indians and injuring 2,000. The RAF bombed rebel territories six times, the Whipping Act was reintroduced, and collective punishment imposed. In March 1943, General Lockhart wrote that India was now \u201can occupied and hostile country\u201d. Indians did fight for the allies, with more than 2.5 million joining the Indian army, the largest volunteer force in history, with 90,000 killed or maimed. But, as the historian Richard Overy writes: \u201cBritain compelled India to pay for its role in the war, forcing the Indian government to run a large annual deficit from an economy that could ill afford the cost, and to accept sharp increases in taxation for the Indian population\u201d, calling it \u201ceffectively a form of economic coercion\u201d. Now, nearly 80 years later, with so much on the war continuing to emerge through books, films, plays and documentaries, surely this is one subject the British should no longer shy away from discussing. If it isn\u2019t talked about, the divide between how people in Britain see the war and how those in the former colonies see it will continue to grow, preventing a full understanding of history.

We lost this battle. The America of your dreams is calling for you to get back up. That\u2019s the story of America for over 240 years and counting.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/08/young-voters-trump-gen-z\">\u2018A big cratering\u2019: an expert on gen Z\u2019s surprise votes \u2013 and young women\u2019s growing support for Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The message severely clashed with the dire warnings that many Democrats, including Biden, have issued about the dangers of a second Trump term. They have predicted that Trump\u2019s return to power would jeopardize the very foundation of American democracy. They assured voters that Trump would make good on his promise to deport millions of undocumented people. And they raised serious doubts about Trump\u2019s pledge to veto a nationwide abortion ban.</p> <p>Now as they stare down four more years of Trump\u2019s presidency, Democrats must reckon with the reality that those warnings were for naught. Not only did Trump win the White House, but he is on track to win the popular vote, making him the first Republican to do so since 2004. Senate Republicans have regained their majority, and they appear confident in their chances of holding the House of Representatives, with several key races still too close to call on Friday morning.</p> <p>The bleak outcome has left Democrats bereft, unmoored and furious when they previously thought this week would be the cause of joy and celebration. They are now heading into a brutal political wilderness with its current leaders tarnished by advanced age and a catastrophic defeat and a younger generation that is yet to fully emerge.</p> <p>The party also faces a likely brutal civil war between its leftists and centrists over the best way forward \u2013 one that will be fought over the levers of power in the party at every level from the grassroots of all 50 US states to the crowded corridors of Congress in Washington.</p> <p>The stark reality has left Democrats asking themselves the same question over and over again: how did we get here?</p> <p>The hypotheses and accusations rose from whispers to shouts starting on Wednesday. Although a handful of Democrats suggested Harris should have done more to distance herself from Biden, few party members<strong> </strong>appeared to blame the nominee, who was credited with running the best possible campaign given her roughly 100-day window to close a considerable gap with Trump.</p> <p>Some Democrats blamed Biden, who withdrew from the presidential race in July only after mounting pressure from his party after a disastrous debate performance against Trump. Jim Manley, who served as a senior adviser to the former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, said that Biden never should have run for re-election.</p> <p>\u201cThis is no time to pull punches or be concerned about anyone\u2019s feelings,\u201d Manley <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/06/democrats-blame-biden-trump-win-00188092\">told Politico</a>. \u201cHe and his staff have done an enormous amount of damage to this country.\u201d</p> <p>In an even more damning indictment, Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker who was applauded for her role in pressuring Biden to step aside, suggested the party should have held an open primary.</p> <p>\u201cHad the president gotten out sooner, there may have been other candidates in the race,\u201d Pelosi <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/us/politics/pelosi-harris-biden-open-primary.html\">told the New York Times</a> on Thursday. \u201cWe live with what happened. And because the president endorsed Kamala Harris immediately, that really made it almost impossible to have a primary at that time. If it had been much earlier, it would have been different.\u201d</p>    <p>A number of other senior Democratic aides <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4977754-democrats-seek-answers-trump-defeat/\">complained</a> to reporters \u2013 on background, without their names attached to the quotes \u2013 that Biden had put the party in a terrible position by not reckoning earlier with the widespread concerns over his age and unpopularity. (Biden would have been 86 at the end of his second term, while Trump will be 82 at the end of his.)</p> <p>The White House pushed back against those gripes, framing Democrats\u2019 losses in a much more global context. Incumbents have lost ground around the world in the past year, a trend that experts largely blame on the anger and disillusionment spurred by the coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing high inflation it caused.</p> <p>The White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, cited this explanation during her press briefing on Thursday, while noting that Biden still believes he \u201cmade the right decision\u201d in stepping aside.</p> <p>\u201cDespite all of the accomplishments that we were able to get done, there were global headwinds because of the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. \u201cAnd it had a political toll on many incumbents, if you look at what happened in 2024 globally.\u201d</p> <p>Despite those headwinds, Democrats wonder if their communication strategy could have prevented Republicans\u2019 triumph. Leaders of the party are now debating the role of new media and how dominant rightwing influencers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/07/joe-rogan-elon-musk-heterodoxy-trump-win-reaction\">particularly</a> in the so-called \u201cmanosphere\u201d, helped propel Trump to victory.</p> <p>Left-leaning Van Jones posited that Democrats had focused too much on traditional media at the expense of cultivating a leftwing media ecosystem, saying in a Substack Live chat: \u201cWe built the wrong machine.\u201d</p> <p>Or perhaps Democrats\u2019 failure to connect with the concerns of working-class voters cost them the White House, as progressives such as Senator Bernie Sanders argued.</p> <p>\u201cIt should come as no great surprise that a Democratic party which has abandoned working-class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,\u201d Sanders said in his post-election statement. \u201cIn the coming weeks and months those of us concerned about grassroots democracy and economic justice need to have some very serious political discussions.\u201d</p> <p>But who will lead those discussions? Biden will be 82 when he leaves the White House in January. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader who has now been demoted to minority leader, is 73. Pelosi is 84. Sanders, who won re-election on Tuesday, will be 89 by the time his new term ends.</p> <p>The party must now look to a new generation of leaders, a pivot that many argue should have come earlier. Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader who still holds out a distant hope of becoming speaker in January if his party can win a majority, might lead the way. Progressive Democrats will probably be looking to popular lawmakers like congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to shape the party\u2019s future. Other rank-and-file members have pointed to Gavin Newsom, the California governor who is already <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/politics/capitol/2024/11/gavin-newsom-special-session-trump-resistance/\">trying</a> to \u201cTrump-proof\u201d his state, as an example for resisting the new administration.</p> <p>They will have a foundation to work from, party leaders assert.

      "bodyText": "Joe Biden stood before the American people, millions of whom were still reeling from the news of Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential race, and reassured them: \u201cWe\u2019re going to be OK.\u201d In his first remarks since his vice-president and chosen successor, Kamala Harris, lost the presidential election, Biden delivered a pep talk from the White House Rose Garden on a sunny Thursday that clashed with Democrats\u2019 black mood in the wake of their devastating electoral losses. Biden pledged a smooth transfer of power to Trump and expressed faith in the endurance of the American experiment. \u201cSetbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable,\u201d Biden said. \u201cA defeat does not mean we are defeated. We lost this battle. The America of your dreams is calling for you to get back up. That\u2019s the story of America for over 240 years and counting.\u201d The message severely clashed with the dire warnings that many Democrats, including Biden, have issued about the dangers of a second Trump term. They have predicted that Trump\u2019s return to power would jeopardize the very foundation of American democracy. They assured voters that Trump would make good on his promise to deport millions of undocumented people. And they raised serious doubts about Trump\u2019s pledge to veto a nationwide abortion ban. Now as they stare down four more years of Trump\u2019s presidency, Democrats must reckon with the reality that those warnings were for naught. Not only did Trump win the White House, but he is on track to win the popular vote, making him the first Republican to do so since 2004. Senate Republicans have regained their majority, and they appear confident in their chances of holding the House of Representatives, with several key races still too close to call on Friday morning. The bleak outcome has left Democrats bereft, unmoored and furious when they previously thought this week would be the cause of joy and celebration. They are now heading into a brutal political wilderness with its current leaders tarnished by advanced age and a catastrophic defeat and a younger generation that is yet to fully emerge. The party also faces a likely brutal civil war between its leftists and centrists over the best way forward \u2013 one that will be fought over the levers of power in the party at every level from the grassroots of all 50 US states to the crowded corridors of Congress in Washington. The stark reality has left Democrats asking themselves the same question over and over again: how did we get here? The hypotheses and accusations rose from whispers to shouts starting on Wednesday. Although a handful of Democrats suggested Harris should have done more to distance herself from Biden, few party members appeared to blame the nominee, who was credited with running the best possible campaign given her roughly 100-day window to close a considerable gap with Trump. Some Democrats blamed Biden, who withdrew from the presidential race in July only after mounting pressure from his party after a disastrous debate performance against Trump. Jim Manley, who served as a senior adviser to the former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, said that Biden never should have run for re-election. \u201cThis is no time to pull punches or be concerned about anyone\u2019s feelings,\u201d Manley told Politico. \u201cHe and his staff have done an enormous amount of damage to this country.\u201d In an even more damning indictment, Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker who was applauded for her role in pressuring Biden to step aside, suggested the party should have held an open primary. \u201cHad the president gotten out sooner, there may have been other candidates in the race,\u201d Pelosi told the New York Times on Thursday. \u201cWe live with what happened. And because the president endorsed Kamala Harris immediately, that really made it almost impossible to have a primary at that time. If it had been much earlier, it would have been different.\u201d A number of other senior Democratic aides complained to reporters \u2013 on background, without their names attached to the quotes \u2013 that Biden had put the party in a terrible position by not reckoning earlier with the widespread concerns over his age and unpopularity. (Biden would have been 86 at the end of his second term, while Trump will be 82 at the end of his.) The White House pushed back against those gripes, framing Democrats\u2019 losses in a much more global context. Incumbents have lost ground around the world in the past year, a trend that experts largely blame on the anger and disillusionment spurred by the coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing high inflation it caused. The White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, cited this explanation during her press briefing on Thursday, while noting that Biden still believes he \u201cmade the right decision\u201d in stepping aside. \u201cDespite all of the accomplishments that we were able to get done, there were global headwinds because of the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. \u201cAnd it had a political toll on many incumbents, if you look at what happened in 2024 globally.\u201d Despite those headwinds, Democrats wonder if their communication strategy could have prevented Republicans\u2019 triumph. Leaders of the party are now debating the role of new media and how dominant rightwing influencers, particularly in the so-called \u201cmanosphere\u201d, helped propel Trump to victory. Left-leaning Van Jones posited that Democrats had focused too much on traditional media at the expense of cultivating a leftwing media ecosystem, saying in a Substack Live chat: \u201cWe built the wrong machine.\u201d Or perhaps Democrats\u2019 failure to connect with the concerns of working-class voters cost them the White House, as progressives such as Senator Bernie Sanders argued. \u201cIt should come as no great surprise that a Democratic party which has abandoned working-class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,\u201d Sanders said in his post-election statement. \u201cIn the coming weeks and months those of us concerned about grassroots democracy and economic justice need to have some very serious political discussions.\u201d But who will lead those discussions? Biden will be 82 when he leaves the White House in January. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader who has now been demoted to minority leader, is 73. Pelosi is 84. Sanders, who won re-election on Tuesday, will be 89 by the time his new term ends. The party must now look to a new generation of leaders, a pivot that many argue should have come earlier. Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader who still holds out a distant hope of becoming speaker in January if his party can win a majority, might lead the way. Progressive Democrats will probably be looking to popular lawmakers like congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to shape the party\u2019s future. Other rank-and-file members have pointed to Gavin Newsom, the California governor who is already trying to \u201cTrump-proof\u201d his state, as an example for resisting the new administration. They will have a foundation to work from, party leaders assert. Although Trump\u2019s victory was devastating to them, Democrats protected at least three and possibly five competitive Senate seats while mitigating Republican gains in the House. Even if House Republicans maintain control of the chamber, they will be forced to govern with a narrow majority that proved disastrous during the last session and could pave the wave for significant Democratic gains in 2026. For now, though, the Democrats who poured their hearts and souls into electing Harris as the first woman, first Black woman and first Asian American woman to serve as president seem exhausted. They have spent most of the past decade warning the country about the dangers of Trump and his political philosophy only for a majority of American voters to send him back to the White House. While Trump\u2019s first electoral victory sparked a wave of outrage and protests among Democrats, his second win seemed met with a mournful sigh from many of his critics. Right now, Democrats are taking the time to grieve. And then, eventually, they will start to pick up the pieces of their party.

This week, Davis made headlines by threatening Letitia James, the attorney general of New York who brought successful civil cases against Trump and his company and who has said she will \u201cfight back\u201d as Trump returns to power.</p> <p>\u201cLet me just say this to Big Tish James,\u201d Davis <a href=\"https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/1854615830358614487\">told</a> the podcaster Benny Johnson. \u201cI dare you to try to continue your lawfare against President Trump in his second term. Because listen here, sweetheart, we\u2019re not messing around this time. And we will put your fat ass in prison for conspiracy against rights, I promise you that.\u201d</p> <p>Davis has also asked a January 6 conspiracy theorist for \u201cpardon and commutation lists\u201d and <a href=\"https://x.com/mrddmia/status/1854200785975775609\">said</a> of Trump\u2019s opponents: \u201cI want to drag their dead political bodies through the streets, burn them, and throw them off the wall.

I\u2019m <em>obviously</em> trolling them.\u201d The Guardian understands Davis has told allies privately and publicly he does not want to be attorney general, a sentiment relayed to Trump.</p> <p>Many observers are looking to Mike Lee, the Utah senator who was <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/10/senator-mike-lee-trump-support/679565/\">eagerly involved</a> in Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the 2020 election, for attorney general. John Ratcliffe, Trump\u2019s former director of national intelligence, and Texas attorney general Ken Paxton \u2013 like Trump a scandal-magnet, impeached and indicted \u2013 are also in the running.</p> <p>Sources advised paying close attention to names discussed for deputy attorney general, given the DAG\u2019s role in running the Department of Justice day to day. <a href=\"https://www.schaerr-jaffe.com/attorneys/mark-r-paoletta/\">Mark Paoletta</a>, a lawyer and Catholic hardliner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/16/david-brock-clarence-thomas-supreme-court-stench-book\">close</a> to the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas and his wife, the rightwing activist Ginni Thomas, was said to be in the frame. Paoletta \u2013 who was general counsel for the Office of Management and Budget has in the first Trump administration \u2013 is also linked to the top job.</p> <p>Other figures from the first administration are linked to roles in the second.

Kennedy ran for president as an independent before backing Trump. He is also a vaccine conspiracy theorist and a supporter of removing fluoride from public drinking water, positions that prompt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/fluoride-explainer-what-is-us-election-donald-trump-robert-f-kennedy-jr\">alarm</a> among public health advocates.</p> <p>After Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/election-trump-rfk-jr-vaccines-fluoride\">indicated</a> he was open to Kennedy\u2019s wish to ban vaccines, Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist and <a href=\"https://necsi.edu/eric-feigl-ding\">faculty member</a> at the New England Complex Systems Instute, said simply: \u201cI\u2019m saddest of all for the kids who soon may not get vaccines to save their lives from preventable diseases.\u201d</p> <p>Musk, owner of X, Tesla and SpaceX, backed Trump\u2019s campaign and has said he expects a role in slashing the federal budget. Rather less wealthy figures likely to hold influence as advisers if not cabinet appointees include Stephen Miller, the far-right immigration hawk; Kash Patel, who ended the first Trump term at the Pentagon; and Johnny McEntee, who went from \u201cbody man\u201d to <a href=\"https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/who-would-help-trump-carry-out-his-promised-purge-of-the-deep-state/\">purge-planner</a> in the first Trump White House.</p> <p>For secretary of defense, Trump is believed to be considering Christopher Miller, the former special forces officer and Project 2025 author whose actions (or lack of them) on January 6 were <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/politics/chris-miller-house-select-committee/index.html\">scrutinized</a> by the investigating House committee. Names in the Pentagon frame also include Mike Waltz, a Florida congressman and former Green Beret, and Mike Pompeo, a soldier and congressman who was CIA director then secretary of state last time.</p> <p>Marco Rubio, the Florida senator who ran against Trump for the Republican nomination in 2016, is widely touted for secretary of state. This week, Rubio <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/06/politics/transition-donald-trump-jockeying/index.html\">told</a> CNN: \u201cI always am interested in serving this country.\u201d</p> <p>Bill Hagerty, a Tennessee senator and former ambassador to Japan, is also reported to be under consideration to be Trump\u2019s top diplomat. Richard Grenell, formerly ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence, is reported to covet the role too. Fox News reported that Grenell could become national security adviser. Robert O\u2019Brien, the sixth and last man to fill the role in Trump\u2019s first term, is also a possible pick to return. Elise Stefanik, the New Yorker in Republican House leadership, is reported to be a possible ambassador to the UN.</p> <p>Numerous plutocrats, among them the hedge fund billionaire John Paulson, have been suggested for treasury secretary. Robert Lighthizer, a veteran whose last role was US trade representative, likely to be an important post given Trump\u2019s obsessions with China and tariffs, is also in the picture. Doug Burgum, the North Dakota governor Trump considered for vice-president before picking the Ohio senator JD Vance, is reportedly well placed for interior secretary.</p> <p>Amid ceaseless speculation about Trump\u2019s plans, sources told the Guardian to keep in mind that Project 2025, though deeply alarming to progressives in calling for purges of federal workers and attacks on minority rights, is most likely something of a red herring \u2013 a new version of policy plans produced by the Heritage Foundation since the days of Reagan and never implemented fully.</p> <p>The America First Policy Institute, set up by Stephen Miller and with McMahon chairing its board, is much more closely involved with transition plans. Also at AFPI is Chad Wolf, formerly acting homeland security secretary and a contender this time.</p> <p>Mass deportations \u2013 and housing migrants in camps \u2013 were a key part of Trump\u2019s pitch. On the campaign trail, Trump <a href=\"https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2024/07/15/rnc-chair-whatley-trump-project-2025\">spoke favorably</a> of Tom Homan, previously acting director of US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or Ice.</p> <p>A Heritage fellow and Project 2025 author, Homan told this summer\u2019s Republican national convention in Milwaukee he had \u201ca message for the millions of illegal aliens who Joe Biden allowed to enter the country in violation of federal law \u2013 start packing, because you\u2019re going home.\u201d</p> <p>Homan was also <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/thomas-homan-rnc-white-supremacist-conference_n_669856f6e4b05a9a604f80d9\">reported</a> to have accepted an invitation to a white nationalist conference hosted by Nick Fuentes, the Holocaust denier and Hitler admirer who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/25/us/politics/trump-nick-fuentes-dinner.html\">dined</a> with Trump and Kanye West at Mar-a-Lago in 2022.</p> <p>On Thursday, Homan told <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-and-project-2025-contributor-thomas-homan-if-trump-needs-help-running-deportation\">Fox News</a> he had \u201cnot politicked or asked \u2026 for a cabinet position\u201d, and that no offer had been made. But he added: \u201cPresident Trump knows if he needs help securing that border I\u2019m standing by. If he needs help running a deportation operation, I am standing by.\u201d</p>",

Mike Davis, a lawyer and former Senate aide, is constantly linked to the role. This week, Davis made headlines by threatening Letitia James, the attorney general of New York who brought successful civil cases against Trump and his company and who has said she will \u201cfight back\u201d as Trump returns to power. \u201cLet me just say this to Big Tish James,\u201d Davis told the podcaster Benny Johnson. \u201cI dare you to try to continue your lawfare against President Trump in his second term. Because listen here, sweetheart, we\u2019re not messing around this time. And we will put your fat ass in prison for conspiracy against rights, I promise you that.\u201d Davis has also asked a January 6 conspiracy theorist for \u201cpardon and commutation lists\u201d and said of Trump\u2019s opponents: \u201cI want to drag their dead political bodies through the streets, burn them, and throw them off the wall. (Legally, politically, and financially, of course.)\u201d Praised by Donald Trump Jr as \u201cthe tip of the spear defending my father\u201d and \u201cexactly the type of fighter that I\u2019d like to see involved in a second Trump administration\u201d, Davis would seem guaranteed to quash both criminal charges hanging over Trump and sentencing for his 34 criminal convictions in his New York hush-money trial. However, Davis himself has owned up to being deliberately outrageous \u2013 telling Politico: \u201cIt\u2019s hilarious that it\u2019s so easy to trigger [Trump\u2019s opponents and the press]. I\u2019m obviously trolling them.\u201d The Guardian understands Davis has told allies privately and publicly he does not want to be attorney general, a sentiment relayed to Trump. Many observers are looking to Mike Lee, the Utah senator who was eagerly involved in Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the 2020 election, for attorney general. John Ratcliffe, Trump\u2019s former director of national intelligence, and Texas attorney general Ken Paxton \u2013 like Trump a scandal-magnet, impeached and indicted \u2013 are also in the running. Sources advised paying close attention to names discussed for deputy attorney general, given the DAG\u2019s role in running the Department of Justice day to day. Mark Paoletta, a lawyer and Catholic hardliner close to the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas and his wife, the rightwing activist Ginni Thomas, was said to be in the frame. Paoletta \u2013 who was general counsel for the Office of Management and Budget has in the first Trump administration \u2013 is also linked to the top job. Other figures from the first administration are linked to roles in the second. Many have links to Project 2025, a policy planning effort co-ordinated by the hard-right Heritage Foundation that produced the Mandate for Leadership, a 900-page compendium of extreme proposals. Chapter authors now contenders for Trump jobs include Christopher Miller, who was acting defense secretary during the Capitol attack; Russell Vought, Trump\u2019s chair of the Office of Management and Budget; Peter Navarro, a trade adviser who went to prison for contempt of Congress; and Roger Severino, formerly a senior official at the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump has said he will give Robert F Kennedy Jr a prominent role in health policy, as some sort of \u201cczar\u201d if not health secretary. Kennedy ran for president as an independent before backing Trump. He is also a vaccine conspiracy theorist and a supporter of removing fluoride from public drinking water, positions that prompt alarm among public health advocates. After Trump indicated he was open to Kennedy\u2019s wish to ban vaccines, Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist and faculty member at the New England Complex Systems Instute, said simply: \u201cI\u2019m saddest of all for the kids who soon may not get vaccines to save their lives from preventable diseases.\u201d Musk, owner of X, Tesla and SpaceX, backed Trump\u2019s campaign and has said he expects a role in slashing the federal budget. Rather less wealthy figures likely to hold influence as advisers if not cabinet appointees include Stephen Miller, the far-right immigration hawk; Kash Patel, who ended the first Trump term at the Pentagon; and Johnny McEntee, who went from \u201cbody man\u201d to purge-planner in the first Trump White House. For secretary of defense, Trump is believed to be considering Christopher Miller, the former special forces officer and Project 2025 author whose actions (or lack of them) on January 6 were scrutinized by the investigating House committee. Names in the Pentagon frame also include Mike Waltz, a Florida congressman and former Green Beret, and Mike Pompeo, a soldier and congressman who was CIA director then secretary of state last time. Marco Rubio, the Florida senator who ran against Trump for the Republican nomination in 2016, is widely touted for secretary of state. This week, Rubio told CNN: \u201cI always am interested in serving this country.\u201d Bill Hagerty, a Tennessee senator and former ambassador to Japan, is also reported to be under consideration to be Trump\u2019s top diplomat. Richard Grenell, formerly ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence, is reported to covet the role too. Fox News reported that Grenell could become national security adviser. Robert O\u2019Brien, the sixth and last man to fill the role in Trump\u2019s first term, is also a possible pick to return. Elise Stefanik, the New Yorker in Republican House leadership, is reported to be a possible ambassador to the UN. Numerous plutocrats, among them the hedge fund billionaire John Paulson, have been suggested for treasury secretary. Robert Lighthizer, a veteran whose last role was US trade representative, likely to be an important post given Trump\u2019s obsessions with China and tariffs, is also in the picture. Doug Burgum, the North Dakota governor Trump considered for vice-president before picking the Ohio senator JD Vance, is reportedly well placed for interior secretary. Amid ceaseless speculation about Trump\u2019s plans, sources told the Guardian to keep in mind that Project 2025, though deeply alarming to progressives in calling for purges of federal workers and attacks on minority rights, is most likely something of a red herring \u2013 a new version of policy plans produced by the Heritage Foundation since the days of Reagan and never implemented fully. The America First Policy Institute, set up by Stephen Miller and with McMahon chairing its board, is much more closely involved with transition plans. Also at AFPI is Chad Wolf, formerly acting homeland security secretary and a contender this time. Mass deportations \u2013 and housing migrants in camps \u2013 were a key part of Trump\u2019s pitch. On the campaign trail, Trump spoke favorably of Tom Homan, previously acting director of US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or Ice. A Heritage fellow and Project 2025 author, Homan told this summer\u2019s Republican national convention in Milwaukee he had \u201ca message for the millions of illegal aliens who Joe Biden allowed to enter the country in violation of federal law \u2013 start packing, because you\u2019re going home.\u201d Homan was also reported to have accepted an invitation to a white nationalist conference hosted by Nick Fuentes, the Holocaust denier and Hitler admirer who dined with Trump and Kanye West at Mar-a-Lago in 2022. On Thursday, Homan told Fox News he had \u201cnot politicked or asked \u2026 for a cabinet position\u201d, and that no offer had been made. But he added: \u201cPresident Trump knows if he needs help securing that border I\u2019m standing by. If he needs help running a deportation operation, I am standing by.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>On a Saturday, while my mum was working at the local Wimpy, my auntie\u2019s boyfriend would take me to watch Grimsby Town. After one game, I bolted through the door to tell my mum that I\u2019d learned some new songs. There was \u201cWho\u2019s the wanker in the black?\u201d to the referee, and \u201cShut up baldy\u201d to the opposing team\u2019s manager. My mum explained the referee was probably doing his best and that the manager couldn\u2019t help being bald.</p> <p>Twenty-five years later and I was sitting in hair and makeup on the set of <em>Soccer AM</em> while the makeup artist covered up the bags under my eyes. I\u2019d got home at 2am after doing a comedy gig in Manchester and then got up again at 6am. After touching up my face, she reached for a pot and started sprinkling black powder generously on my hair. \u201cIt\u2019s for the cameras,\u201d she said, \u201cso the lights don\u2019t bounce off your bald patches.\u201d It felt as if I\u2019d been heckled, but had no comeback prepared. My stomach dropped. It was the first time that I\u2019d been described as \u201cbald\u201d.</p> <p>I was aware my hair had been thinning for the past three or four years, but I\u2019d thought I was getting away with it. I\u2019d comb my hair left to right to conceal my scalp and then use the \u201chair island\u201d at the front of my head to try to camouflage the aforementioned comb-over. It was very much like using a large coat to cover two people sitting on each other\u2019s shoulders to get into a club. I\u2019d heavily edit photos to make sure it looked as if I had a full barnet. But as I got out of that makeup chair and headed to the studio, I found myself discreetly looking at every reflection. Even with the added sprinkles, I felt far less confident than when I\u2019d arrived. I realised that the truth was out there. I was a balding man and I probably needed to do something about it. First, though, I needed to chat about my standup tour live on TV. In that TV studio, I felt not just less confident but, I realised, less of a man.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t have anyone to talk to about going bald. None of my friends or family members were bald, or even seemingly thinning. There were some older comics I gigged with who had clearly been bald for a while, but I didn\u2019t think I could just ask about their hair loss. Why would I ask a colleague about his loss of masculinity before he performed to a room full of hen parties on a rowdy Saturday night in Birmingham?</p>    <p>It seemed as though my body was letting me down by not being able to keep hold of my hair. We\u2019re told the story of Samson at school \u2013 how he lost his hair and then his strength. Well, now it was my turn. I felt I was becoming weaker as each follicle left my head, as if I became less respected by people the thinner my hair got. Bald people are often pitied or vilified. They\u2019re usually the bad guys in films. I can\u2019t remember a single bald contestant on <em>Love Island</em>, and bald people are often the first people to get picked on in a comedy club. Their body has \u201cfailed them\u201d by not being able to keep their hair and now they\u2019re going to pay the price for it. Who came up with this mad old playbook? Telling us that hair is a measure of success and prosperity and anything other than a full head of hair means something\u2019s not quite right. Whoever it was had got us good. It was to my surprise that I discovered male pattern baldness is actually a result of too much testosterone. Turns out I\u2019m too much of a man. Didn\u2019t matter.</p> <p>In comedy, you spend years trying to hone your USP, and my \u201ccharacter\u201d and \u201cvoice\u201d had always included the fact that I had hair. I was fat and I made jokes about that. I didn\u2019t want to be fat <em>and</em> bald. I would scour the internet searching for \u201cmiracle cures\u201d, which resulted in spending hundreds of pounds on various potions and lotions. I imported garlic shampoo from Turkey and tried various caffeine shampoos in car-oil shaped bottles. I used products for horses \u2013 actual horses, because I saw a thread on a hair loss forum from a user who said they had applied their horse\u2019s shampoo \u201cby mistake\u201d and now they had a ponytail. I necked biotin tablets on a daily basis. I gulped vitamin D spray. Before I went to bed, I applied various foams to my scalp that claim to stop hereditary hair loss in the hope I\u2019d wake up with hair like peak David Beckham, not Larry David.</p> <p>Not only were these solutions not working, but my hair was visibly worse. So, one day before an audition I headed to Boots and bought some of the makeup artist\u2019s magic black sprinkles (keratin fibres), then headed to Soho Theatre to use their toilets and apply my new best mates. I must have been in the cubicle for some time as a member of staff came and knocked on the cubicle door and asked if I was taking drugs. \u201cNo, sorry, just taking some medication, be out in a second,\u201d was my excuse. I was more embarrassed about sprinkling black powder on my hair than snorting cocaine at 11am, but this was my new life.</p> <p>I\u2019d increase the usage as the bald patches expanded, spraying them in place using industrial strength hairspray, then praying it didn\u2019t rain. I couldn\u2019t go swimming, knowing that, like a gremlin, as soon as I hit the water all hell would break loose. Dating was a minefield, too. I\u2019d been on a number of dates with one lady who I quite liked and obviously I hadn\u2019t told her I had the male equivalent of a Wonderbra in my hair. On the day of the date, I popped into John Lewis and bought some dark blue pillow cases, so that if my sprinkles came off during the night she\u2019d not see them when we woke up. I then woke up extra early to head to the bathroom to style my hair in place again. My work suffered; I was less confident in acting auditions, paranoid they\u2019d be looking at my hair. When doing standup, I was like a coiled spring \u2013 just waiting for someone to heckle me about going bald. I had about 10 comebacks at the ready. \u201cYeah, well, actually mate, every time I sleep with your mum I get my tweezers out and pluck a single hair from my head.\u201d It was no way to work.</p>    <p>After my 40th birthday, I decided I was tired of both covering up my baldness and the daily logistics that came with it, having to wake up an extra 20 minutes each day to factor in my sprinkling routine. I just wanted to feel confident in my appearance. I\u2019m friends with quite a lot of footballers thanks to my days as co-host on <em>Soccer AM</em> and I noticed a few of them had clearly been for hair transplants as soon as the most recent season finished. They\u2019d post a \u201cclose friend\u2019s\u201d story of them with a newly shaved head. I reached out to a couple I considered friends and politely asked if they\u2019d had a transplant, and to my surprise they were all so forthcoming, offering advice on clinics, aftercare, how to deal with swelling, what travel pillow is best for when you\u2019re sleeping upright for days on end. I trawled the internet, examining Trustpilot reviews as if they were a plumber coming to fit a new boiler. I\u2019d weigh up the pros and cons of going to Turkey versus a clinic on home soil. In the end, I decided to go to a place in London that two friends had gone to and by all accounts had a very pleasant experience. Plus, it was only a 12-minute taxi ride away.</p> <p><em><strong>The clinic felt more like</strong></em> a five-star hotel where I\u2019d won a free stay. There was a wide carpeted staircase and cast-iron bannisters, and stained glass windows blasting colour on to the tiled floor. At no point in my life did I ever think, as a working-class lad from Grimsby, I\u2019d be going to a clinic on Harley Street to have a cosmetic procedure. I had always just assumed that was for a \u201ccertain type\u201d of person. It\u2019s where the royals go for medical treatments, and the rich and famous for nose jobs. I\u2019ve been thinking lots about my various midlife crises, or \u201crenaissances\u201d as I\u2019m calling them. Who <em>is</em> the type of person who has a cosmetic treatment done? Do we still stereotype them? Why are they doing it? Having done a fair amount of asking (mainly female) friends about their procedures, it\u2019s often the case that they\u2019re simply trying to make themselves feel \u201chappier\u201d.</p> <p>I think most people just want to feel normal. For years, I\u2019d wake up and look at my balding head and quite honestly, I\u2019d feel awful. I\u2019d start the day sad and I\u2019d have to work on myself to get out of that lull. Like my friends who have had lip filler, or a breast reduction, I too wanted to wake up happy. But is it really to make <em>yourself</em> happier? Or is to make yourself happier knowing that you\u2019re not going to get judged in the street, that you\u2019re not going to get heckled because of your shiny head, that you\u2019re not just going to get auditions for wrong \u2019uns in TV shows. What even is \u201cnormal\u201d? If there was nobody to see (or judge) my thinning hair, would I still be sad? I don\u2019t know. We live in this world where irrational beauty standards are the norm and we either accept it or suffer the consequences. We must have luscious hair on our heads, but not on our shoulders and the hair downstairs must be \u201cscaped\u201d \u2013 and that\u2019s just for men. I\u2019m clearly a victim of wanting to be accepted and I hope you accept that. I\u2019m not alone in this forest and people can see my hair falling, and they can hear me crying. So, off to I go to W1.</p> <p>The day itself was emotional. I\u2019ll think back on it fondly because it felt so empowering, as if I was doing a reverse Samson and getting my strength back. For those unfamiliar with a FUE hair transplant, essentially, it involves removing healthy hair follicles individually from the \u201cdonor site\u201d, which then leaves the back of your head looking like a strawberry in both colour and texture. They then re-implant those follicles into the thinner areas, in my case the front of my hairline all the way back to the crown. Mine was undertaken by an actual brain surgeon (apparently there\u2019s more money in hair than brains), while I was sat upright watching a middle-aged Australian lady breakdance at the Olympics, wondering really how strong that Valium was. While it might seem quite invasive, the only thing that actually hurt was the anaesthetic injections. Sweet lord, they were horrific. Imagine someone injecting a headache into your scalp, but that headache is also made of concrete. My testicles are retracting even as I\u2019m typing this. Anaesthetic injections: they\u2019re really not nice.</p> <p>In total, I had 3,052 grafts taken. I was in at 9am and out by 5pm, with an hour for lunch. This was a classy clinic in central London that I\u2019d paid good money for and so I was expecting quite a lavish afternoon tea, but what I got was a ham and mayo sandwich from Wenzel\u2019s the Bakers. The thick white bread felt like being a kid again, like getting a hug from my mum. I was wrapped up in its familiar embrace. I almost cried as I finished my last bite. That Valium really was doing its thing.</p> <p>When they finish, they do the big reveal. It\u2019s basically the same as when you\u2019re at the hairdresser\u2019s and they show you your head in the mirror, except that you\u2019ve just spent \u00a36,000. I saw a hairline at the front of my head for the first time in years. Sure, it was covered in blood, but it was there. I eyed every millimetre of it, following it intently as though it were a river on a map. I got teary at the prospect of having hair again, at not having to worry about going out in the wind, looking forward to diving into the sea and not being ashamed of what I\u2019d look like coming up. I couldn\u2019t wait to dispose of my remaining fibres as though I was dispensing of a relative\u2019s ashes.</p> <p>It was going to take time to get to that point \u2013 there was a very regimented aftercare procedure; sleeping upright for five nights, spraying your hair every half hour with saline, making sure nothing goes anywhere near your head for 14 days, no sexual acts for 10 days, the list goes on. But it was all part of my renaissance and I was excited. I took about 100 photos of my head in the cab on the way back and I didn\u2019t edit a single one. I\u2019d been reborn.</p> <p>I\u2019m now in my \u201cugly duckling\u201d phase where the hair has started to shed and my head is patchy \u2013 a process we\u2019re told to trust, as over the next six months I should start to see the results. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s around the corner, both physically and mentally, but I\u2019ve retired those heckle comebacks for the time being. I recognise myself a bit more now, in the mirror and also within my actual self, not just because of the hairline. It\u2019s been the biggest journey of self discovery I\u2019ve ever taken. I won\u2019t be singing any songs abusing bald football managers anytime soon, but I will give the gaffer the name of the clinic I went to and tell him my DMs are open. </p> <p><em>Lloyd Griffith stars in Return to Paradise which airs later in November on BBC One</em></p>",

I didn\u2019t want to be fat and bald. I would scour the internet searching for \u201cmiracle cures\u201d, which resulted in spending hundreds of pounds on various potions and lotions. I imported garlic shampoo from Turkey and tried various caffeine shampoos in car-oil shaped bottles. I used products for horses \u2013 actual horses, because I saw a thread on a hair loss forum from a user who said they had applied their horse\u2019s shampoo \u201cby mistake\u201d and now they had a ponytail. I necked biotin tablets on a daily basis. I gulped vitamin D spray. Before I went to bed, I applied various foams to my scalp that claim to stop hereditary hair loss in the hope I\u2019d wake up with hair like peak David Beckham, not Larry David. Not only were these solutions not working, but my hair was visibly worse. So, one day before an audition I headed to Boots and bought some of the makeup artist\u2019s magic black sprinkles (keratin fibres), then headed to Soho Theatre to use their toilets and apply my new best mates. I must have been in the cubicle for some time as a member of staff came and knocked on the cubicle door and asked if I was taking drugs. \u201cNo, sorry, just taking some medication, be out in a second,\u201d was my excuse. I was more embarrassed about sprinkling black powder on my hair than snorting cocaine at 11am, but this was my new life. I\u2019d increase the usage as the bald patches expanded, spraying them in place using industrial strength hairspray, then praying it didn\u2019t rain. I couldn\u2019t go swimming, knowing that, like a gremlin, as soon as I hit the water all hell would break loose. Dating was a minefield, too. I\u2019d been on a number of dates with one lady who I quite liked and obviously I hadn\u2019t told her I had the male equivalent of a Wonderbra in my hair. On the day of the date, I popped into John Lewis and bought some dark blue pillow cases, so that if my sprinkles came off during the night she\u2019d not see them when we woke up. I then woke up extra early to head to the bathroom to style my hair in place again. My work suffered; I was less confident in acting auditions, paranoid they\u2019d be looking at my hair. When doing standup, I was like a coiled spring \u2013 just waiting for someone to heckle me about going bald. I had about 10 comebacks at the ready. \u201cYeah, well, actually mate, every time I sleep with your mum I get my tweezers out and pluck a single hair from my head.\u201d It was no way to work. After my 40th birthday, I decided I was tired of both covering up my baldness and the daily logistics that came with it, having to wake up an extra 20 minutes each day to factor in my sprinkling routine. I just wanted to feel confident in my appearance. I\u2019m friends with quite a lot of footballers thanks to my days as co-host on Soccer AM and I noticed a few of them had clearly been for hair transplants as soon as the most recent season finished. They\u2019d post a \u201cclose friend\u2019s\u201d story of them with a newly shaved head. I reached out to a couple I considered friends and politely asked if they\u2019d had a transplant, and to my surprise they were all so forthcoming, offering advice on clinics, aftercare, how to deal with swelling, what travel pillow is best for when you\u2019re sleeping upright for days on end. I trawled the internet, examining Trustpilot reviews as if they were a plumber coming to fit a new boiler. I\u2019d weigh up the pros and cons of going to Turkey versus a clinic on home soil. In the end, I decided to go to a place in London that two friends had gone to and by all accounts had a very pleasant experience. Plus, it was only a 12-minute taxi ride away. The clinic felt more like a five-star hotel where I\u2019d won a free stay. There was a wide carpeted staircase and cast-iron bannisters, and stained glass windows blasting colour on to the tiled floor. At no point in my life did I ever think, as a working-class lad from Grimsby, I\u2019d be going to a clinic on Harley Street to have a cosmetic procedure. I had always just assumed that was for a \u201ccertain type\u201d of person. It\u2019s where the royals go for medical treatments, and the rich and famous for nose jobs. I\u2019ve been thinking lots about my various midlife crises, or \u201crenaissances\u201d as I\u2019m calling them. Who is the type of person who has a cosmetic treatment done? Do we still stereotype them? Why are they doing it? Having done a fair amount of asking (mainly female) friends about their procedures, it\u2019s often the case that they\u2019re simply trying to make themselves feel \u201chappier\u201d. I think most people just want to feel normal. For years, I\u2019d wake up and look at my balding head and quite honestly, I\u2019d feel awful. I\u2019d start the day sad and I\u2019d have to work on myself to get out of that lull. Like my friends who have had lip filler, or a breast reduction, I too wanted to wake up happy. But is it really to make yourself happier? Or is to make yourself happier knowing that you\u2019re not going to get judged in the street, that you\u2019re not going to get heckled because of your shiny head, that you\u2019re not just going to get auditions for wrong \u2019uns in TV shows. What even is \u201cnormal\u201d? If there was nobody to see (or judge) my thinning hair, would I still be sad? I don\u2019t know. We live in this world where irrational beauty standards are the norm and we either accept it or suffer the consequences. We must have luscious hair on our heads, but not on our shoulders and the hair downstairs must be \u201cscaped\u201d \u2013 and that\u2019s just for men. I\u2019m clearly a victim of wanting to be accepted and I hope you accept that. I\u2019m not alone in this forest and people can see my hair falling, and they can hear me crying. So, off to I go to W1. The day itself was emotional. I\u2019ll think back on it fondly because it felt so empowering, as if I was doing a reverse Samson and getting my strength back. For those unfamiliar with a FUE hair transplant, essentially, it involves removing healthy hair follicles individually from the \u201cdonor site\u201d, which then leaves the back of your head looking like a strawberry in both colour and texture. They then re-implant those follicles into the thinner areas, in my case the front of my hairline all the way back to the crown. Mine was undertaken by an actual brain surgeon (apparently there\u2019s more money in hair than brains), while I was sat upright watching a middle-aged Australian lady breakdance at the Olympics, wondering really how strong that Valium was. While it might seem quite invasive, the only thing that actually hurt was the anaesthetic injections. Sweet lord, they were horrific. Imagine someone injecting a headache into your scalp, but that headache is also made of concrete. My testicles are retracting even as I\u2019m typing this. Anaesthetic injections: they\u2019re really not nice. In total, I had 3,052 grafts taken. I was in at 9am and out by 5pm, with an hour for lunch. This was a classy clinic in central London that I\u2019d paid good money for and so I was expecting quite a lavish afternoon tea, but what I got was a ham and mayo sandwich from Wenzel\u2019s the Bakers. The thick white bread felt like being a kid again, like getting a hug from my mum. I was wrapped up in its familiar embrace. I almost cried as I finished my last bite. That Valium really was doing its thing. When they finish, they do the big reveal. It\u2019s basically the same as when you\u2019re at the hairdresser\u2019s and they show you your head in the mirror, except that you\u2019ve just spent \u00a36,000. I saw a hairline at the front of my head for the first time in years. Sure, it was covered in blood, but it was there. I eyed every millimetre of it, following it intently as though it were a river on a map. I got teary at the prospect of having hair again, at not having to worry about going out in the wind, looking forward to diving into the sea and not being ashamed of what I\u2019d look like coming up. I couldn\u2019t wait to dispose of my remaining fibres as though I was dispensing of a relative\u2019s ashes. It was going to take time to get to that point \u2013 there was a very regimented aftercare procedure; sleeping upright for five nights, spraying your hair every half hour with saline, making sure nothing goes anywhere near your head for 14 days, no sexual acts for 10 days, the list goes on. But it was all part of my renaissance and I was excited. I took about 100 photos of my head in the cab on the way back and I didn\u2019t edit a single one. I\u2019d been reborn. I\u2019m now in my \u201cugly duckling\u201d phase where the hair has started to shed and my head is patchy \u2013 a process we\u2019re told to trust, as over the next six months I should start to see the results. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s around the corner, both physically and mentally, but I\u2019ve retired those heckle comebacks for the time being. I recognise myself a bit more now, in the mirror and also within my actual self, not just because of the hairline. It\u2019s been the biggest journey of self discovery I\u2019ve ever taken. I won\u2019t be singing any songs abusing bald football managers anytime soon, but I will give the gaffer the name of the clinic I went to and tell him my DMs are open.

The aggregate number of estimated bird collisions and resulting deaths is calculated using data from on-the-ground volunteers who count the injured and dead, and then extrapolating what this sample means overall given total migration numbers and prior mortality statistics. \u201cJust anecdotally, this does seem to be higher this year compared to what they have seen last year, at least,\u201d Chen said. \u201cWe started off the season with a pretty heavy week, which usually starts late August, early September, and this year was a pretty startling week to start off with,\u201d Chen said. \u201cWe found over 100 birds during that first week, which isn\u2019t something that we\u2019ll typically find there. \u201cAgain, there are a lot of factors that go into how many birds you find, and we are monitoring more locations this year than we were last year, so that could be another factor.\u201d But, Chen said, \u201cwe didn\u2019t find over 100\u201d in fall 2023. One reason why advocates might be seeing increased collisions: data indicates that more migratory birds are flying through New York, with more than 9.7 million passing over Manhattan so far this fall, compared with about 9.5 million in 2023. This data, from BirdCast, uses the US weather surveillance radar network to track nocturnal bird migration. Farnsworth, who co-founded BirdCast, said it was normal for the number to fluctuate season-over-season. Jessica Wilson, NYC Bird Alliance executive director, said that the bird collision crisis \u2013 the group estimates that more than 1 billion birds die every year in the US from glass collisions \u2013 could be stopped if cities and buildings took just a few steps. \u201cCollisions with windows represent a major, but fixable, threat to wild birds,\u201d Wilson said in a statement. \u201cSimple, commonsense solutions can prevent many of these deaths.\u201d Some city buildings, Wilson noted, voluntarily turn out needless lights at night, preventing reflections that can fatally confuse migrating birds. Other buildings have put in bird-safe glass. \u201cBut voluntary actions are not enough: millions of buildings still pose deadly risks to birds due to artificial light at night and untreated glass.\u201d A bill aimed at preventing light-related bird collision deaths is pending in New York City.",

Developing countries want assurances that trillions will flow to them in the next decade to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions in line with the rapidly receding hope of limiting global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels, and to enable them to cope with the increasingly evident extreme weather that rising temperatures are driving.</p> <h2>Ilham Aliyev, Azerbaijani president</h2>    <p>The autocratic president of Azerbaijan since 2003, Ilham Aliyev has used Azerbaijan\u2019s oil wealth to gain international influence for his small country, as well as to enrich his own family. Aliyev is the son of Heydar Aliyev, a national leader when the country was part of the Soviet bloc, who regained power in a 1993 after the country\u2019s first free post-Soviet elections the year before.</p> <p>Azerbaijan is rated as one of the world\u2019s most corrupt regimes by Transparency International, with a poor record on human rights. Freedom of expression is limited, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/12/azerbaijan-accused-of-media-crackdown-before-hosting-cop29\">media are shackled</a> and campaigners have raised concerns over <a href=\"https://evnreport.com/new-updates/fate-of-armenian-pows-and-detainees-in-azerbaijan/\">a number of prisoners held since the conflict with Armenia</a>. Aliyev is likely to shrug off such criticism and focus instead on his plans to generate and export renewable energy and attempts to clean up the Caspian Sea.</p> <h2>Mukhtar Babayev, Cop29 president-designate</h2>    <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/12/newly-elected-leaders-climate-obligations-cop29-chief-un-summit-mukhtar-babayev\">president-designate of Cop29 </a>is Azerbaijan\u2019s minister for ecology and natural resources. Like his predecessor, Sultan Al Jaber, who presided over last year\u2019s Cop28 in Dubai, Babayev has a background in the oil industry. He worked for Socar, the country\u2019s national oil company, from 1994 to 2018, before his ministerial appointment.</p> <p>Babayev, an affable and competent figure, is well regarded among developing and developed countries at the talks, though he was little known before Azerbaijan\u2019s surprise decision to take on the hosting of Cop29. Choosing the host nation was a troubled process, only resolved at the last moment during last year\u2019s Cop28.</p> <p>This year is the turn of the post-Soviet bloc to host, and several eastern European EU members including Romania, Bulgaria and Poland had expressed an interest. All were vetoed by Russia\u2019s president Vladimir Putin, angered by the EU\u2019s response to his invasion of Ukraine. Azerbaijan was regarded as an outside possibility because of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nagorno-karabakh\">conflict with Armenia</a> that has rumbled on through two decades, flaring into outright war last September before subsiding into an uneasy de facto truce.</p> <p>But just as the organisers were preparing emergency plans to host the Cop at one of the UN\u2019s campuses, Putin indicated he would allow the choice and Armenia supported the bid, leaving Azerbaijan\u2019s president to make Babayev the obvious appointment.</p> <p>He will be assisted by Yalchin Rafijev, the deputy foreign minister with a background in diplomacy, who is chief negotiator and the key point of contact for delegations.</p> <h2>Sultan Al Jaber, Cop 29 president</h2>    <p>At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/15/fossil-fuels-how-a-huge-gamble-sealed-cop28-deal\">last year\u2019s Cop28 summit in Dubai</a>, nations made a historic agreement to \u201ctransition away\u201d from fossil fuels. It was a weaker commitment than the full-blooded \u201cphase-out\u201d of fossil fuels that many countries and activists wanted, but \u2013 astonishingly \u2013 it represented the first time that these three decades of talks have produced a commitment to tackle the root cause of the climate crisis.</p> <p>The promise was largely the work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/07/meet-the-oil-man-tasked-with-saving-the-planet-cop28\">the Cop28 president, the United Arab Emirates minister Sultan Al Jaber</a>. A charismatic figure who is also chief of the UAE\u2019s national oil company, Adnoc, Al Jaber dominated the Dubai conference and helped bring Saudi Arabia to the table.</p> <p>That will not be the last of his influence. After Cop28, Al Jaber also masterminded continued influence over the process by helping to institute a new \u201ctroika\u201d system for Cops, whereby the current Cop presidency is joined by the immediate past presidency and the designated next presidency to provide a degree of continuity that should safeguard progress made at previous Cops and strengthen future commitments.</p> <h2>Marina Silva, Brazil environment minister</h2>    <p>There were high hopes that Cop29 would be galvanised by the presence of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2024/feb/29/taxation-worlds-billionaires-super-rich-g20-brazil\">outspoken espousal of a billionaire tax</a> has endeared him to activists and vulnerable countries. But he is unlikely to make it, so his place is most likely to be taken by environment and climate minister, Marina Silva.</p> <p>Brazil occupies at key position at Cop29 as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/09/brazil-g20-lula-west-global-south\">prospective president of Cop30</a>. Next year, at Belem in the Amazon, countries must arrive with fresh national plans \u2013 known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) \u2013 enforcing more stringent cuts to greenhouse gas emissions than they have yet promised. These must be in line with the globally accepted aim of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C above preindustrial levels.</p> <p>Brazil, as the third member of the troika, will want to use Cop29 to chivvy laggard governments to present their NDCs as early as possible. Technically the deadline is February, but many countries are likely to see Cop30 itself as the de facto deadline.</p> <h2>Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, UN secretary general</h2>    <p>The UN secretary general is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/04/un-secretary-general-antonio-guterres-cop27-climate-action\">probably the most outspoken senior figure on the world stage on the climate crisis</a>. He has talked of humanity committing \u201ccollective suicide\u201d and has targeted fossil fuel companies who \u201chave humanity by the throat\u201d. Amid rapidly rising temperatures, he memorably warned that we are understating the seriousness of the crisis: \u201cThe era of global warming has ended; the era of global boiling has arrived.\u201d</p> <p>Guterres will champion developing nations at Cop29, encouraging and berating rich countries into providing more climate finance. He is likely to be equally outspoken to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/04/un-chief-antonio-guterres-climate-crisis-cop27\">leaders of countries with high emissions</a> and inadequate reduction plans and, most of all, to the fossil fuel executives who are expected to turn up in large numbers as many multinational oil and gas companies, including BP and Shell, have strong interests in Azerbaijan.</p> <h2>Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change</h2>    <p>Climate-related disaster struck close to home this year for the UN\u2019s climate chief. Simon Stiell is executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change \u2013 the treaty under which this \u201cconference of the parties\u201d (Cop) is held \u2013 and comes from the island of Carriacou, in Grenada. It was hit by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/03/jamaica-braces-for-arrival-of-hurricane-beryl\">Hurricane Beryl</a> in July.</p> <p>Stiell <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/news/simon-stiell-from-carriacou-fossil-fuel-driven-climate-costs-are-an-economic-wrecking-ball-hitting\">spoke movingly</a> from the site of his grandmother\u2019s house, utterly destroyed in the disaster. \u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing on my home island, Carriacou, must not become humanity\u2019s new normal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf governments everywhere don\u2019t step up, 8 billion people will be facing this blunt force trauma head-on, on a continuous basis. We need climate action back at the top of political agendas.\u201d</p> <p>Stiell\u2019s job at Cop29 will be to work closely with the Azerbaijani presidency, acting as an honest broker to all 198 parties, and guiding an agreement through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/11/cop-climate-change-conference-30-years-highlights-lowlights\">complexities of the UNFCCC process</a>.</p> <h2>Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados</h2>    <p>The prime minister of Barbados, under whom the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/mia-mottley-barbados-pm-who-broke-with-queen-hopes-for-election-boost\">removed the British crown as head of state</a> to become a fully fledged republic, has been an electrifying presence at recent Cops, and her mission to force the restructuring of international financial institutions has already borne fruit, with the new World Bank president, Ajay Banga, promising to take a more active role in climate finance.</p> <p>Mottley wants to go much further and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/09/leaders-urged-to-reform-finance-to-aid-the-poorest-hit-by-the-climate-crisis\">secure the flow of trillions of dollars of investment each year to the developing world</a>, to transform the global economy and provide protection for those most at risk of climate disaster. She has forged close ties with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/23/paris-climate-finance-summit-fails-to-deliver-debt-forgiveness-plan\">held a climate finance summit last year</a>, and with the Kenyan president, William Ruto.</p> <p>With Cop29 focused on climate finance, she will be a linchpin for developing countries seeking climate justice in the face of inaction by the worst greenhouse gas emitters.</p> <h2>Ajay Banga, World Bank president</h2>    <p>With climate finance top of the Cop29 agenda, the World Bank president Ajay Banga is in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/apr/17/billions-more-overseas-aid-climate-world-bank-imf-spring-summit\">pole position to make a difference</a>. But will he order the sweeping reforms to the bank\u2019s practices that developing countries say are needed?</p> <p>The World Bank held its annual autumn meetings last month, but there was little progress on climate finance. The group is awaiting a pledging conference next month, where developed countries must increase the amount of money they are prepared to put towards developing country finance. Focusing on that may mean that Banga has little to offer at Cop29, but that will not satisfy his critics.</p> <h2>The Americans</h2>    <p>Joe Biden is not expected to attend Cop29, nor will his successor Donald Trump. During his last presidency, Trump withdrew the US from the Paris agreement, and he is likely to do so again. However, the delegation for the US at Cop29 will be from the Biden White House, as Trump will not take office until January. The \u201clame duck\u201d delegation can still participate in the negotiations, and though they will not be able to bind the US government to clear future financial commitments, they are unlikely to stand in the way of agreement by other countries, meaning that the core decisions expected to made at Cop29 on finance can still go ahead.</p> <h2>Wopke Hoekstra, EU climate commissioner</h2>    <p>The EU delegation to Cop29 will be rather a skeleton staff this year, as key figures \u2013 such as Teresa Ribera, the former Spanish environment minister who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/04/fossil-fuel-firms-should-volunteer-to-help-vulnerable-countries-says-spanish-minister\">played a galvanising role in recent Cops</a> and is relishing the prospect of a new role as vice-president of the European Commission, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/08/this-may-be-our-last-chance-cop28-talks-enter-final-phase\">Dan Jorgensen</a>, former Danish environment minister and another Cop veteran who will be the new EU energy and housing chief \u2013 are undergoing their confirmation processes, which will not be completed until a vote in the EU parliament on 1 December.</p> <p>Hoekstra, who served as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/10/eu-climate-chief-urges-meps-not-to-use-crisis-as-political-tool\">climate commissioner in the last iteration of the commission</a> and keeps the job for this one, is a confirmed participant, leading the EU negotiations for the second week of the talks. He faces a big challenge \u2013 the EU is the biggest provider of climate finance around the world, but a rightward slant to the new parliament and among some member state governments may cut down on the bloc\u2019s freedom to manoeuvre at the talks.</p> <h2>Liu Zhenmin, China\u2019s climate spokesperson</h2> <p>Cop29 will be the first proper outing for the new Chinese climate envoy. His predecessor, Xie Zhenhua, was a key figure at Cops for two decades and enjoyed a cordial relationship with John Kerry, the US special presidential envoy for climate. Both retired earlier this year.</p> <p>Liu and his US counterpart, Kerry\u2019s successor John Podesta, have enjoyed some warm meetings this year, including one at Podesta\u2019s home. But even cosy dinners cannot disguise the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/30/trade-row-wont-hurt-us-and-chinas-emissions-talks-says-us-climate-chief\">real tensions between the two powers</a>. China is the world\u2019s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases by a long way, responsible for close to a third of global emissions, and is also the world\u2019s second biggest economy, after the US. Yet China clings to its status as a developing country, under the 1992 UNFCCC treaty, and has refused to take on obligations to provide finance to the poor world, though it does provide such assistance on a voluntary level and under its own terms.</p> <p>China will come under fierce pressure from the EU and the US to make commitments on climate finance and to demonstrate that its emissions will peak soon and fall sharply in the next iteration of its NDC. China and the US will also hold a methane summit during Cop29, at which activists will be hoping for concrete new measures to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/06/reduce-methane-or-face-climate-catastrophe-scientists-warn\">curb the powerful greenhouse gas</a>, rather than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/10/china-and-the-us-announce-plan-to-work-together-on-cutting-emissions\">good intentions that have been the only outcomes of previous talks</a>.</p> <h2>Ed Miliband, UK secretary of state for energy security and net zero</h2>    <p>Cop29 will mark a resonant return to the world stage for Ed Miliband, the UK\u2019s energy and net zero secretary, who played a significant role in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8fb70c48-ed9b-11de-ba12-00144feab49a\">salvaging a partial deal from the tumultuous Copenhagen Cop in 2009</a>. In recent years, he has attended Cops as an opposition minister, well-respected and listened to, with a wide network of international contacts among delegations and Cop veterans.</p> <p>In stark contrast to his Tory predecessors, who tended to send junior ministers \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/12/uk-minister-departs-cop28-as-climate-talks-reach-crisis-point\">not always for the key moments</a> \u2013 Miliband will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/15/ed-miliband-lead-uk-negotiations-cop29-climate-summit\">take charge of the negotiations himself</a> throughout the conference, he will be assisted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/25/who-is-rachel-kyte-the-uks-new-climate-envoy\">Rachel Kyte, the newly appointed climate envoy</a>, a post that had been scrapped by Rishi Sunak.</p> <h2>Keir Starmer, prime minister of the UK</h2>    <p>At last year\u2019s Cop in Dubai, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/04/keir-starmer-vows-to-make-uk-climate-leader-again-labour-cop28-rishi-sunak\">Starmer got his first taste of what leading on the world stage might be like</a>, and it clearly had an impact. He used his first speech to his fellow world leaders, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-united-nations-general-assembly-speech-26-september-2024\">at the UN general assembly in September</a>, to declare the climate crisis a key priority. \u201cWe are returning the UK to responsible global leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it is right \u2013 yes, absolutely. But also because it is plainly in our self-interest \u2026 the threat of climate change is existential and it is happening in the here and now. So we have reset Britain\u2019s approach.\u201d</p> <p>He will come to Cop29 armoured with action: he will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/29/uk-emissions-targets-cop29-climate-summit-labour\">unveil the UK\u2019s NDC</a>, expected to promise deep cuts in emissions, in an attempt to rally other nations to make similarly bold pledges. A key question he must also answer is how the UK intends to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/26/ed-miliband-labour-honour-pledge-11bn-overseas-climate-aid\">make good on the pledge made under Boris Johnson to spend \u00a311.6bn on climate aid</a> to developing countries by 2026. By the last days of Sunak\u2019s government, only 45% of the total had been disbursed, leaving a heavier burden on Labour to make up the shortfall.</p> <h2>Strongmen surprises in store?</h2> <p>Vladimir Putin visited Azerbaijan in August for meetings with Aliyev, to underscore the resumption of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/25/azerbaijans-nagorno-karabakh-victory-highlights-limits-of-russias-power\">relationship that has been tested in the last three years</a>, after the Cop host took over the supply of gas to the EU as the bloc tried to cut its dependence on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. Azerbaijan also <a href=\"https://www.commonspace.eu/opinion/opinion-azerbaijan-remains-consistent-its-support-ukraine\">has its own links to Ukraine</a>.</p> <p>But Azerbaijan only managed to supply the EU so fruitfully by importing Russian gas for its own needs, demonstrating the <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/azerbaijan-winner-caucasus-ukraine-war-russia-relations/32917647.html\">relationship that still exists between the former Soviet pair</a>.</p> <p>Putin\u2019s August visit was the first in six years. He is still unlikely to make an appearance at Cop29, but the Russian delegation is likely to have more behind-the-scenes involvement than it usually enjoys.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/01/narendra-modi-pledges-india-will-reach-net-zero-emissions-by-2070\">Narendra Modi</a>, prime minister of India, received a warm personal invitation to the talks by Aliyev. Modi has skipped recent Cops and is viewed as unlikely to attend this one, but there is still an outside chance that Aliyev\u2019s urging might tempt him. India has taken a trenchant line on climate finance, blasting developed countries for failing to do enough and demanding \u00a31tn a year. The country also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/15/india-committed-to-clean-energy-but-continues-to-boost-coal-production\">continues to depend heavily on coal</a>, despite a burgeoning renewable energy sector.</p> <p>Other strongmen of the world have also been mooted as potential visitors, but few are likely to be among the 100 world leaders coming. Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad was invited to Cop28 in Dubai, but did not attend. Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/11/venezuela-election-maduro-gonzalez-exiled\">fraudulently claimed re-election in Venezuela</a>, may wish to try to legitimise his presidency by coming to enjoy the company of his fellow oil producers.</p>",

Babayev, an affable and competent figure, is well regarded among developing and developed countries at the talks, though he was little known before Azerbaijan\u2019s surprise decision to take on the hosting of Cop29. Choosing the host nation was a troubled process, only resolved at the last moment during last year\u2019s Cop28. This year is the turn of the post-Soviet bloc to host, and several eastern European EU members including Romania, Bulgaria and Poland had expressed an interest. All were vetoed by Russia\u2019s president Vladimir Putin, angered by the EU\u2019s response to his invasion of Ukraine. Azerbaijan was regarded as an outside possibility because of the conflict with Armenia that has rumbled on through two decades, flaring into outright war last September before subsiding into an uneasy de facto truce. But just as the organisers were preparing emergency plans to host the Cop at one of the UN\u2019s campuses, Putin indicated he would allow the choice and Armenia supported the bid, leaving Azerbaijan\u2019s president to make Babayev the obvious appointment. He will be assisted by Yalchin Rafijev, the deputy foreign minister with a background in diplomacy, who is chief negotiator and the key point of contact for delegations. Sultan Al Jaber, Cop 29 president At last year\u2019s Cop28 summit in Dubai, nations made a historic agreement to \u201ctransition away\u201d from fossil fuels. It was a weaker commitment than the full-blooded \u201cphase-out\u201d of fossil fuels that many countries and activists wanted, but \u2013 astonishingly \u2013 it represented the first time that these three decades of talks have produced a commitment to tackle the root cause of the climate crisis. The promise was largely the work of the Cop28 president, the United Arab Emirates minister Sultan Al Jaber. A charismatic figure who is also chief of the UAE\u2019s national oil company, Adnoc, Al Jaber dominated the Dubai conference and helped bring Saudi Arabia to the table. That will not be the last of his influence. After Cop28, Al Jaber also masterminded continued influence over the process by helping to institute a new \u201ctroika\u201d system for Cops, whereby the current Cop presidency is joined by the immediate past presidency and the designated next presidency to provide a degree of continuity that should safeguard progress made at previous Cops and strengthen future commitments. Marina Silva, Brazil environment minister There were high hopes that Cop29 would be galvanised by the presence of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, whose outspoken espousal of a billionaire tax has endeared him to activists and vulnerable countries. But he is unlikely to make it, so his place is most likely to be taken by environment and climate minister, Marina Silva. Brazil occupies at key position at Cop29 as the prospective president of Cop30. Next year, at Belem in the Amazon, countries must arrive with fresh national plans \u2013 known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) \u2013 enforcing more stringent cuts to greenhouse gas emissions than they have yet promised. These must be in line with the globally accepted aim of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C above preindustrial levels. Brazil, as the third member of the troika, will want to use Cop29 to chivvy laggard governments to present their NDCs as early as possible. Technically the deadline is February, but many countries are likely to see Cop30 itself as the de facto deadline. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, UN secretary general The UN secretary general is probably the most outspoken senior figure on the world stage on the climate crisis. He has talked of humanity committing \u201ccollective suicide\u201d and has targeted fossil fuel companies who \u201chave humanity by the throat\u201d. Amid rapidly rising temperatures, he memorably warned that we are understating the seriousness of the crisis: \u201cThe era of global warming has ended; the era of global boiling has arrived.\u201d Guterres will champion developing nations at Cop29, encouraging and berating rich countries into providing more climate finance. He is likely to be equally outspoken to leaders of countries with high emissions and inadequate reduction plans and, most of all, to the fossil fuel executives who are expected to turn up in large numbers as many multinational oil and gas companies, including BP and Shell, have strong interests in Azerbaijan. Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Climate-related disaster struck close to home this year for the UN\u2019s climate chief. Simon Stiell is executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change \u2013 the treaty under which this \u201cconference of the parties\u201d (Cop) is held \u2013 and comes from the island of Carriacou, in Grenada. It was hit by Hurricane Beryl in July. Stiell spoke movingly from the site of his grandmother\u2019s house, utterly destroyed in the disaster. \u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing on my home island, Carriacou, must not become humanity\u2019s new normal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf governments everywhere don\u2019t step up, 8 billion people will be facing this blunt force trauma head-on, on a continuous basis. We need climate action back at the top of political agendas.\u201d Stiell\u2019s job at Cop29 will be to work closely with the Azerbaijani presidency, acting as an honest broker to all 198 parties, and guiding an agreement through the complexities of the UNFCCC process. Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados The prime minister of Barbados, under whom the country removed the British crown as head of state to become a fully fledged republic, has been an electrifying presence at recent Cops, and her mission to force the restructuring of international financial institutions has already borne fruit, with the new World Bank president, Ajay Banga, promising to take a more active role in climate finance. Mottley wants to go much further and secure the flow of trillions of dollars of investment each year to the developing world, to transform the global economy and provide protection for those most at risk of climate disaster. She has forged close ties with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who held a climate finance summit last year, and with the Kenyan president, William Ruto. With Cop29 focused on climate finance, she will be a linchpin for developing countries seeking climate justice in the face of inaction by the worst greenhouse gas emitters. Ajay Banga, World Bank president With climate finance top of the Cop29 agenda, the World Bank president Ajay Banga is in pole position to make a difference. But will he order the sweeping reforms to the bank\u2019s practices that developing countries say are needed? The World Bank held its annual autumn meetings last month, but there was little progress on climate finance. The group is awaiting a pledging conference next month, where developed countries must increase the amount of money they are prepared to put towards developing country finance. Focusing on that may mean that Banga has little to offer at Cop29, but that will not satisfy his critics. The Americans Joe Biden is not expected to attend Cop29, nor will his successor Donald Trump. During his last presidency, Trump withdrew the US from the Paris agreement, and he is likely to do so again. However, the delegation for the US at Cop29 will be from the Biden White House, as Trump will not take office until January. The \u201clame duck\u201d delegation can still participate in the negotiations, and though they will not be able to bind the US government to clear future financial commitments, they are unlikely to stand in the way of agreement by other countries, meaning that the core decisions expected to made at Cop29 on finance can still go ahead. Wopke Hoekstra, EU climate commissioner The EU delegation to Cop29 will be rather a skeleton staff this year, as key figures \u2013 such as Teresa Ribera, the former Spanish environment minister who has played a galvanising role in recent Cops and is relishing the prospect of a new role as vice-president of the European Commission, and Dan Jorgensen, former Danish environment minister and another Cop veteran who will be the new EU energy and housing chief \u2013 are undergoing their confirmation processes, which will not be completed until a vote in the EU parliament on 1 December. Hoekstra, who served as climate commissioner in the last iteration of the commission and keeps the job for this one, is a confirmed participant, leading the EU negotiations for the second week of the talks. He faces a big challenge \u2013 the EU is the biggest provider of climate finance around the world, but a rightward slant to the new parliament and among some member state governments may cut down on the bloc\u2019s freedom to manoeuvre at the talks. Liu Zhenmin, China\u2019s climate spokesperson Cop29 will be the first proper outing for the new Chinese climate envoy. His predecessor, Xie Zhenhua, was a key figure at Cops for two decades and enjoyed a cordial relationship with John Kerry, the US special presidential envoy for climate. Both retired earlier this year. Liu and his US counterpart, Kerry\u2019s successor John Podesta, have enjoyed some warm meetings this year, including one at Podesta\u2019s home. But even cosy dinners cannot disguise the real tensions between the two powers. China is the world\u2019s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases by a long way, responsible for close to a third of global emissions, and is also the world\u2019s second biggest economy, after the US. Yet China clings to its status as a developing country, under the 1992 UNFCCC treaty, and has refused to take on obligations to provide finance to the poor world, though it does provide such assistance on a voluntary level and under its own terms. China will come under fierce pressure from the EU and the US to make commitments on climate finance and to demonstrate that its emissions will peak soon and fall sharply in the next iteration of its NDC. China and the US will also hold a methane summit during Cop29, at which activists will be hoping for concrete new measures to curb the powerful greenhouse gas, rather than the good intentions that have been the only outcomes of previous talks. Ed Miliband, UK secretary of state for energy security and net zero Cop29 will mark a resonant return to the world stage for Ed Miliband, the UK\u2019s energy and net zero secretary, who played a significant role in salvaging a partial deal from the tumultuous Copenhagen Cop in 2009. In recent years, he has attended Cops as an opposition minister, well-respected and listened to, with a wide network of international contacts among delegations and Cop veterans. In stark contrast to his Tory predecessors, who tended to send junior ministers \u2013 and not always for the key moments \u2013 Miliband will take charge of the negotiations himself throughout the conference, he will be assisted by Rachel Kyte, the newly appointed climate envoy, a post that had been scrapped by Rishi Sunak. Keir Starmer, prime minister of the UK At last year\u2019s Cop in Dubai, Starmer got his first taste of what leading on the world stage might be like, and it clearly had an impact. He used his first speech to his fellow world leaders, at the UN general assembly in September, to declare the climate crisis a key priority. \u201cWe are returning the UK to responsible global leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it is right \u2013 yes, absolutely. But also because it is plainly in our self-interest \u2026 the threat of climate change is existential and it is happening in the here and now. So we have reset Britain\u2019s approach.\u201d He will come to Cop29 armoured with action: he will unveil the UK\u2019s NDC, expected to promise deep cuts in emissions, in an attempt to rally other nations to make similarly bold pledges. A key question he must also answer is how the UK intends to make good on the pledge made under Boris Johnson to spend \u00a311.6bn on climate aid to developing countries by 2026. By the last days of Sunak\u2019s government, only 45% of the total had been disbursed, leaving a heavier burden on Labour to make up the shortfall. Strongmen surprises in store? Vladimir Putin visited Azerbaijan in August for meetings with Aliyev, to underscore the resumption of a relationship that has been tested in the last three years, after the Cop host took over the supply of gas to the EU as the bloc tried to cut its dependence on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. Azerbaijan also has its own links to Ukraine. But Azerbaijan only managed to supply the EU so fruitfully by importing Russian gas for its own needs, demonstrating the relationship that still exists between the former Soviet pair. Putin\u2019s August visit was the first in six years. He is still unlikely to make an appearance at Cop29, but the Russian delegation is likely to have more behind-the-scenes involvement than it usually enjoys. Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, received a warm personal invitation to the talks by Aliyev. Modi has skipped recent Cops and is viewed as unlikely to attend this one, but there is still an outside chance that Aliyev\u2019s urging might tempt him. India has taken a trenchant line on climate finance, blasting developed countries for failing to do enough and demanding \u00a31tn a year. The country also continues to depend heavily on coal, despite a burgeoning renewable energy sector. Other strongmen of the world have also been mooted as potential visitors, but few are likely to be among the 100 world leaders coming. Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad was invited to Cop28 in Dubai, but did not attend. Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who fraudulently claimed re-election in Venezuela, may wish to try to legitimise his presidency by coming to enjoy the company of his fellow oil producers.",

The cynical may observe that the medium also allows Williams to build a Lego brick wall between Neville and the parts of his life and career that his subject would prefer not to discuss, so don\u2019t go into this expecting anything other than a shiny plastic hagiography.

      "body": "<p>Few writers working today capture the liminality of life as viscerally as the Norwegian 2023 Nobel prize winner Jon Fosse, and in <em>Morning and Evening</em>, his newly republished 2000 novella (elegantly translated by Damion Searls), we follow one person\u2019s passage from womb to Earth, and from Earth to the afterlife, in a near seamless progression. This, then, is not a novel that describes a life; it is a fable about the very beginning and end of a life \u2013 a metaphysical ghost story.</p> <p>The two-part book opens with a woman delivering her second child in a house on the island of Holmen. Olai, the father whose perspective we inhabit, waits anxiously in the kitchen. Could both baby and mother die? No, \u201cGod surely doesn\u2019t want that\u201d, but then Olai has \u201cnever doubted that Satan rules this world as much as the good Lord does\u201d. As in his seven-volume masterpiece <em>Septology</em><em> </em>(2019), Fosse\u2019s prose is suffused with mysticism, and a more personal and nuanced theism. There was no doubt in Olai\u2019s mind that God exists, but he \u201chas never fully believed that He is all-powerful and all-knowing like they say, the pious people\u201d. The good Lord does not rule all and decide everything. On that day, however, He prevails. The mother survives. The child comes into the world alive and healthy. Olai names him Johannes, after his father, and decides that he will be a fisherman like himself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/oct/28/nobel-prize-winner-jon-fosse-it-took-years-before-i-dared-to-write-again\">Nobel prize winner Jon Fosse: \u2018It took years before I dared to write again\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The second part, chiefly told from Johannes\u2019s point of view, chronicles the eerie hours after he wakes up one morning, late in his old age. Johannes is a now retired fisherman. His wife, Erna, is long dead. His mornings are \u201csad and lonely\u201d. Johannes makes coffee.

      "bodyText": "Few writers working today capture the liminality of life as viscerally as the Norwegian 2023 Nobel prize winner Jon Fosse, and in Morning and Evening, his newly republished 2000 novella (elegantly translated by Damion Searls), we follow one person\u2019s passage from womb to Earth, and from Earth to the afterlife, in a near seamless progression. This, then, is not a novel that describes a life; it is a fable about the very beginning and end of a life \u2013 a metaphysical ghost story. The two-part book opens with a woman delivering her second child in a house on the island of Holmen. Olai, the father whose perspective we inhabit, waits anxiously in the kitchen. Could both baby and mother die? No, \u201cGod surely doesn\u2019t want that\u201d, but then Olai has \u201cnever doubted that Satan rules this world as much as the good Lord does\u201d. As in his seven-volume masterpiece Septology (2019), Fosse\u2019s prose is suffused with mysticism, and a more personal and nuanced theism. There was no doubt in Olai\u2019s mind that God exists, but he \u201chas never fully believed that He is all-powerful and all-knowing like they say, the pious people\u201d. The good Lord does not rule all and decide everything. On that day, however, He prevails. The mother survives. The child comes into the world alive and healthy. Olai names him Johannes, after his father, and decides that he will be a fisherman like himself. The second part, chiefly told from Johannes\u2019s point of view, chronicles the eerie hours after he wakes up one morning, late in his old age. Johannes is a now retired fisherman. His wife, Erna, is long dead. His mornings are \u201csad and lonely\u201d. Johannes makes coffee. He steps out of the house and everything he beholds seems different somehow. He meets his dead neighbour, and good friend Peter, and they go fishing. Johannes later bumps into his daughter Signe and \u201cis seized with deep despair, because Signe cannot see him or hear him\u201d. At the tale\u2019s close, Peter accompanies Johannes to a place where nothing hurts and \u201ceverything you love is there\u201d. Fosse has a precious ear for the muted whimpers of grief; there are such depths of ache contained in this brief novel. That we begin the journey of dying as soon as we are born may be one of this book\u2019s most effectively dramatised insights, but it succeeds, no less brilliantly, in conveying late-life pain and melancholia; what the days feel like once friends and lovers are gone and we have but our own vanishing selves for company. \u2022 Morning and Evening by Jon Fosse (translated by Damion Searls) is published by Fitzcarraldo (\u00a39.99).

To reach it from the nearest station, you cross a thundering dual carriageway via a dank tunnel, and then follow the road past a branch of Tesco until you reach a bridge that takes you over a creek (the studio was once a water mill). When I first see it, this bridge strikes me as perfectly ordinary; in the water below, an Evian bottle bobs, disconsolately. But in the future, I will always think of this spot as a threshold, a portal to enchantment. On one side, heavy traffic and stray supermarket trolleys. On the other, the uncommonly strange spell cast by 30 young men in old T-shirts and baggy shorts leaping ever&nbsp;skywards.</p> \n<p>Inside, I watch this group dance for an hour, barely able to look away long enough to write in my notebook. The sight of them would, I think, be remarkable in any circumstances. Their boyish, mismatched kit only makes their movements seem the more tenderly expressive, and by doing so, wreaks havoc on the heart (mine feels like a steak that has been violently tenderised). But there are other things going on here, too. These men are the stars of <a href=\"https://www.new-adventures.net/swan-lake#overview\">the latest revival</a> of Bourne\u2019s Swan Lake, a show that not only changed the face of British dance \u2013 the swans, always danced by women in Tchaikovsky\u2019s ballet, are famously performed by men in his version \u2013 but which has been in the world since before most of them were born (the new production, which runs into next year, marks its 30th birthday).</p> \n<p>This Swan Lake is often why they dreamed of dancing in the first place \u2013 perhaps they saw the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/billy-elliot\">Billy Elliot</a>, whose final scene features it \u2013 and to be cast means everything. Lez Brotherston, Bourne\u2019s longtime collaborator and the piece\u2019s designer, says that some dancers cry the first time they put on their feathered swan legs, and when I hear Bourne tell them in a break that their performances are \u201ca little lacking in character\u201d, I see no slumping of shoulders. Their commitment is absolute, an almost tangible thing. Even as they pull on their sweatshirts, every face is turned towards him.</p> \n<p>Does he really think they\u2019re lacking in character? I ask him afterwards. I thought they were perfect! \u201cWell, they\u2019ve got a lot on their plate,\u201d he says (Bourne, who is now a 64-year-old knight of the realm with countless hits behind him \u2013 including adaptations of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/dec/17/edward-scissorhands-matthew-bourne-sadlers-wells-revival-new-adventures\">Edward Scissorhands</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/dec/22/matthew-bourne-the-red-shoes-revival-sadlers-wells-review\">The Red Shoes</a></em> and Patrick Hamilton\u2019s novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/oct/09/matthew-bourne-the-midnight-bell-sadlers-wells-review-patrick-hamilton\">The Midnight Bell</a></em> \u2013 is warm and generous, but at this point he\u2019s not exactly smiling). \u201cThe principals started three weeks ago, and the rest two weeks ago. The work is intense at the moment. They\u2019ve got so much information coming at them every day, their brains are frazzled. You have to be encouraging, but you also have to point out what\u2019s not there.\u201d Where would he say they are on a scale of one to 10? \u201cA seven, though that number would be different for different people.\u201d He asks me if I noticed that Harrison Dowzell, who\u2019s dancing the Swan/the Stranger, was wearing trainers, as opposed to bare feet \u2013 which unnerves me because, in truth, I hardly did. \u201cHe\u2019s got a badly stubbed toe that needs protection, so he has danced the whole rehearsal period in shoes so far \u2013 which isn\u2019t great.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bourne is looking forward to unveiling this production. It\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCdOiYNllUM\">six years</a> since it was last staged; new talent takes it forward. But it\u2019s fascinating, too, to see it in a new context, the wider culture having shifted. \u201cThe thing that\u2019s interesting about this version of <em>Swan Lake</em>, with two men dancing together in what seems like a romantic relationship [in Bourne\u2019s version of Tchaikovsky\u2019s ballet, the Prince falls in love with one of the male swans, and they dance an ardent pas de deux], is that when we first did it, there were people walking out \u2013 not a lot, but they did. But there was also something that was very acceptable to [other audience members]. It was a man and a swan, and perhaps that took the edge off it.\u201d In a way, he\u2019s surprised it didn\u2019t change things in dance more: \u201cOf course everyone\u2019s doing it now: two men have danced on <em>Strictly</em>. But in ballet, it has happened for the first time only recently, in Christopher Wheeldon\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/sep/14/the-australian-ballet-oscar-review-much-to-love-in-this-blend-of-classical-and-contemporary-dance\">Oscar</a></em> [which had its premiere in Melbourne last September]. He was very kind in an interview, referencing me as the pioneer, but he was the first to do it in ballet. We\u2019re not a ballet company.\u201d New Adventures is, he says \u201ca dance theatre company\u201d.</p> \n<p>It strikes me that in 2024, the erotic component of Bourne\u2019s <em>Swan Lake</em> is less significant than the fact that male violence against women is on the rise: it\u2019s moving simply to see men being so tender, so gentle (though his swans are also capable of violence). \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cI know exactly what you mean, and I think that has been very appealing to audiences across the years, and it was one of my intentions: to have men move lyrically, as well as powerfully. You very rarely see men moving together like that.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Nobody could imagine what a male swan looked like. They all thought they were going to come on in tutus</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But for all that <em>Swan Lake</em> continues to seem radical, albeit perhaps for different reasons now, his first impulse was, he insists, pretty straightforward. He\u2019d got to the point where he\u2019d seen <em>Swan Lake</em> on stage so many times, he was able to daydream a bit as he watched it. \u201cAnd I just wondered: why <em>are</em> the swans female? There are male swans out there, after all.\u201d When the opportunity to have a go at it came his way \u2013 his take on <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/dec/12/matthew-bourne-singing-dad-frank-sinatra-nutcracker-christmas-ballet\">The Nutcracker</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/dec/12/matthew-bourne-singing-dad-frank-sinatra-nutcracker-christmas-ballet\"> for Opera North</a> had gone well \u2013 he decided to go for broke: \u201cWe were a small, quirky company of six dancers then. We were upstarts, and we had nothing to lose.\u201d He knew very well it might bomb. What he didn\u2019t predict, even in his wildest dreams, was that queues would soon be snaking round the block outside Sadler\u2019s Wells, where it opened; that it would win every award going (more than 30 of them, including three Tonys); that it would go on to become the longest-running full-length dance classic in the West End and on Broadway.</p> \n<p>What was the first night like? \u201cI was terrified, really terrified. It was one of those times where you feel your legs are going to buckle. I couldn\u2019t speak. It was packed and everywhere I looked there was a famous face from the world of dance \u2026 \u201d The audience, he says, was unprepared for what was ahead \u2013 and therein lay an important part of its success. \u201cNobody could imagine what a male swan looked like. I think they all thought they were going to come on in tutus. When Adam [Cooper, who danced the Swan/the Stranger] made his first entrance, and you saw a swan \u2026&nbsp;they weren\u2019t ready for it. I think we could have done anything after that, and they would have gone with it. They were so excited by it: the scariness, and the beauty. It was the shock of the new, and that wasn\u2019t what I was expecting. And then, in the interval, they went out and talked to one another, and they decided they liked it, you could sense that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Really, though, he can\u2019t remember anything much beyond the moment in the interval when the producer Cameron Mackintosh pinned him against a wall and said: \u201cThis <em>has </em>to be in the West End.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cut to the next morning. A couple of the older critics \u2013 notably Clement Crisp of the <em>Financial Times </em>\u2013 had an attack of the vapours (Crisp maintained his loathing of Bourne\u2019s work thereafter, insisting that he couldn\u2019t take him seriously thanks largely to his \u201cunerring sense of what the public wants\u201d, and that he was tired of his turning masterpieces upside down and \u201cshaking them to see what falls out of their pockets\u201d).</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Successful creative endeavours require alchemy. Some things are highly deliberate, others almost accidental. Adam Cooper wasn\u2019t, perhaps, the obvious choice to dance the Swan/the Stranger at the time; he was a principal at the Royal Ballet, while Bourne\u2019s background was in contemporary dance (he trained at the rather late age of 22, at what was then the Laban Dance Centre in south London). When Bourne went to ask Anthony Dowell, the Royal Ballet\u2019s artistic director, if Cooper might be allowed a sabbatical to perform <em>Swan Lake</em>, Dowell was rather withering (though he said yes). \u201cHe said: so you want <em>Adam</em> to be the swan? Yes, I said. There was a long pause. Is there still a prince? he said. Yes, I said \u2013 and he went: Oh <em>dear!</em>\u201d But it was worth being withered at: Cooper was crucial. \u201cHe was this thoroughbred, a creature from another planet. He made me take the role very seriously. I was always thinking of him, because I wanted to justify his decision to join us. If it had failed, it would have affected his career more than mine.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"91a1eb7e-14d9-4c29-8f45-1c947664d28d\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022 The first version of <i>Swan Lake</i> premiered on 4 March 1877 at the Bolshoi theatre in Moscow, with music by Tchaikovsky and choreography by the Czech Julius Reisinger, who was ballet master at the time. It was not a success.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022 The production that led to the ballet\u2019s worldwide fame and made it one of the most performed works in the repertory premiered on 27 January 1895 at St Petersburg\u2019s Mariinsky theatre. Acts one and three were choreographed by Marius Petipa, while the \u201cwhite\u201d acts were the work of his deputy Lev Ivanov. The music was revised after Tchaikovsky\u2019s death. (Matthew Bourne\u2019s version reverts to the 1877 score.)</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022 The basic plot concerns unhappy Prince Siegfried, who falls in love with a swan maiden Odette, a princess under the power of the evil magician Von Rothbart, seen in the shape of an owl. He tricks Siegfried into swearing eternal love for his daughter Odile, the glittering black swan, and tragedy ensues.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022 The complete Petipa/Ivanov <i>Swan Lake</i> was not seen in the west until Nicholas Sergeyev\u2019s 1934 staging for Ninette de Valois\u2019 Vic-Wells Ballet in London, later the Royal Ballet. He had been notator for the Mariinsky and based the production on the detailed notebooks he smuggled out of Russia after the revolution. Alicia Markova danced Odette/Odile.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022 Alternative versions include a radical reimagining by Peter Darrell for Scottish Ballet in 1977 that conceived the swan scenes as an opium-induced dream; <i>Illusions: Like Swan Lake</i> ( 1976) by John Neumeier for Hamburg Ballet, which twists the story of \u201cmad\u201d King Ludwig of Bavaria and his fascination with swans into the plot; and Mats Ek\u2019s version for the Swedish Cullberg Ballet (1987) featuring both male and female swans and centring on an oedipal prince and his inability to live happily ever after with a real woman (Odile) rather than a fantasy (Odette).</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Sarah Crompton</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIt was a huge risk,\u201d says Cooper, when I talk to him online (he\u2019s in Germany, directing <em>The Pirates of Penzance</em>). \u201cI remember the first time he told me he wanted me to play the lead swan. I thought he was just reversing everybody, so when he said there\u2019d still be a prince [as opposed to a princess], I wasn\u2019t sure. How\u2019s that going to work? I thought. Two men working together? I had a colleague at the Royal Ballet who came up to me and said, \u2018How dare you be a part of this? I hope you know what you\u2019re doing.\u2019 Some people thought of me as a bit of a Judas, doing something so anti-ballet. But of course, it\u2019s not anti-ballet. It celebrates the ballet, but in its own way.\u201d Before the opening night, he was nervous of the audience. \u201cAre they going to stand up and walk out?\u201d But in the event, what he felt mostly was relief. \u201cI could hear that people were loving it, but I was so overwhelmed, it didn\u2019t sink in until later, when it kept happening. The [noisy] curtain call, the queues. Oh my God, I thought. It\u2019s something else&nbsp;completely.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>What\u2019s amazing about Matthew is that he can see things in people \u2013 he focuses on what you can do, not on what you can\u2019t</p> \n  <footer> <cite>Isabel Mortimer, dancer</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>There was a price to pay. In those days, Bourne had only one cast (now he has two, so dancers can rest). Cooper says that the part of the lead Swan involves \u201chuge stamina&nbsp;\u2026 it\u2019s an absolute killer because the choreography means you use every single part of your body, all the time.\u201d Quite soon, his body was so overworked, he broke his foot. But the upsides were by far more important than the downsides: the chance to perform in the West End; the recognition of the new audiences it brought to dance. And of course, he had originated the role, so there was a feeling, not of ownership precisely, but perhaps of pride. \u201cHistorically, ballet directors are these men with sticks, shouting, doing the counts. Matthew\u2019s not like that at all. He has a vision, but within that, he\u2019s interested in other people\u2019s ideas. He\u2019ll always say, \u2018What do you think?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AU-TEd7Sj0U\"> <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AU-TEd7Sj0U?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AU-TEd7Sj0U\">Watch a trailer for Matthew Bourne\u2019s Swan Lake: The Next Generation.</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Isabel Mortimer, who danced the Queen in the first production, echoes all of this (her background, unlike Cooper\u2019s, was in contemporary dance; I meet her in London). \u201cWhat\u2019s amazing about Matthew is that he can see things in people; he focuses on what you can do, not on what you can\u2019t. He\u2019s a curator as much as a choreographer. You can contribute.\u201d In rehearsal for <em>Swan Lake</em>, she tells me, the cast was in a bubble. \u201cIt was only when some people started saying he shouldn\u2019t be allowed to touch this iconic piece that we became aware of what the first night might be like\u201d</p> \n<p>Like Cooper, the strain would eventually tell on her body; it\u2019s unheard of for ballerinas to dance as many performances she did then: \u201cWe had to cut whole dances [when people were injured] because we didn\u2019t have covers!\u201d But in the end, she did it for 10 years, on and off. \u201cIt was life-changing,\u201d she says. \u201cI coach dancers now, and one of the things I talk about is mastery, which is to do with flow, not adrenaline. It was <em>Swan Lake</em> that taught me about flow. My mind would blank out, but my body would do what it needed to.\u201d</p> \n<p>The last person in my <em>Swan Lake</em> jigsaw is Lez Brotherston, Bourne\u2019s longtime set and costume designer \u2013 and talking to him is great. Creative people sometimes struggle to explain their work to outsiders, but Brotherston is like Bourne: both of them talk easily about what they do, without snobbery (I can\u2019t help but connect this with the fact that Bourne thinks of himself as a storyteller who cares deeply about the experience of the audience). It is impossible now to imagine<em> Swan Lake</em> without Brotherston\u2019s costumes \u2013 <a href=\"https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1308868/dance-costume-costume-brotherston-lez/\">a pair of swan legs</a> is on permanent display in the V&amp;A. But like everything else to do with the production, at the time, his head was mostly full of questions. \u201cThe first was: why men? Matthew said, well, swans are feral. So then I thought, OK, we\u2019re talking masculine swans, so they\u2019ll certainly be topless, and I\u2019m assuming that bare feet is better than a jazz shoe. So then it was a case of: what kind of shorts are they wearing? Matthew had a picture of an Indian dancer in trousers that had bits of fringe on it, so I did a prototype along those lines, trousers with raggedy bits on them. In the end, the raggedy bits were silk, because when you wash it, it sort of goes like dreadlocks.\u201d</p> \n<p>Brotherston oversees every new production involving his designs, \u201cwhich is rare \u2026 I mean, I did <em>Seven Deadly Sins</em> with Martha Wainwright at the Royal Opera House in 2007, and when they revived it, the first I knew about it was an invite to a dress rehearsal.\u201d It can be dispiriting, bringing the <em>Swan Lake </em>costumes out: they\u2019re beaten up, ripped and mouldy. But 60 pairs of fresh legs have just been delivered, a moment he always finds peculiarly humbling: \u201cGosh, I think: a drawing that probably took me half-an-hour to do \u2026 and putting them on is a rite of passage for the dancers.\u201d As a young designer, he used to say he would know he had truly made it if he ever saw someone in fancy dress who\u2019d chosen one of his designs, \u00e0 la <em>The Rocky Horror Show</em>. \u201cAnd then it happened. I walked into a bar in New York. It had lots of photographs of its customers, and it had a Halloween night, and there were two guys dressed as swans. I was by myself having a drink. No one knew who I was. But I was so happy \u2013 my swans had made it.\u201d</p> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.new-adventures.net/swan-lake#overview\">Matthew Bourne\u2019s Swan Lake: The Next Generation tours from </a></em><a href=\"https://www.new-adventures.net/swan-lake#overview\">11 November</a><em><a href=\"https://www.new-adventures.net/swan-lake#overview\"> until </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.new-adventures.net/swan-lake#overview\">7 June 2025</a></em><em>.

He\u2019d got to the point where he\u2019d seen Swan Lake on stage so many times, he was able to daydream a bit as he watched it. \u201cAnd I just wondered: why are the swans female? There are male swans out there, after all.\u201d When the opportunity to have a go at it came his way \u2013 his take on The Nutcracker for Opera North had gone well \u2013 he decided to go for broke: \u201cWe were a small, quirky company of six dancers then. We were upstarts, and we had nothing to lose.\u201d He knew very well it might bomb. What he didn\u2019t predict, even in his wildest dreams, was that queues would soon be snaking round the block outside Sadler\u2019s Wells, where it opened; that it would win every award going (more than 30 of them, including three Tonys); that it would go on to become the longest-running full-length dance classic in the West End and on Broadway. What was the first night like? \u201cI was terrified, really terrified. It was one of those times where you feel your legs are going to buckle. I couldn\u2019t speak. It was packed and everywhere I looked there was a famous face from the world of dance \u2026 \u201d The audience, he says, was unprepared for what was ahead \u2013 and therein lay an important part of its success. \u201cNobody could imagine what a male swan looked like. I think they all thought they were going to come on in tutus. When Adam [Cooper, who danced the Swan/the Stranger] made his first entrance, and you saw a swan \u2026 they weren\u2019t ready for it. I think we could have done anything after that, and they would have gone with it. They were so excited by it: the scariness, and the beauty. It was the shock of the new, and that wasn\u2019t what I was expecting. And then, in the interval, they went out and talked to one another, and they decided they liked it, you could sense that.\u201d Really, though, he can\u2019t remember anything much beyond the moment in the interval when the producer Cameron Mackintosh pinned him against a wall and said: \u201cThis has to be in the West End.\u201d Cut to the next morning. A couple of the older critics \u2013 notably Clement Crisp of the Financial Times \u2013 had an attack of the vapours (Crisp maintained his loathing of Bourne\u2019s work thereafter, insisting that he couldn\u2019t take him seriously thanks largely to his \u201cunerring sense of what the public wants\u201d, and that he was tired of his turning masterpieces upside down and \u201cshaking them to see what falls out of their pockets\u201d). *** Successful creative endeavours require alchemy. Some things are highly deliberate, others almost accidental. Adam Cooper wasn\u2019t, perhaps, the obvious choice to dance the Swan/the Stranger at the time; he was a principal at the Royal Ballet, while Bourne\u2019s background was in contemporary dance (he trained at the rather late age of 22, at what was then the Laban Dance Centre in south London). When Bourne went to ask Anthony Dowell, the Royal Ballet\u2019s artistic director, if Cooper might be allowed a sabbatical to perform Swan Lake, Dowell was rather withering (though he said yes). \u201cHe said: so you want Adam to be the swan? Yes, I said. There was a long pause. Is there still a prince? he said. Yes, I said \u2013 and he went: Oh dear!\u201d But it was worth being withered at: Cooper was crucial. \u201cHe was this thoroughbred, a creature from another planet. He made me take the role very seriously. I was always thinking of him, because I wanted to justify his decision to join us. If it had failed, it would have affected his career more than mine.\u201d \u201cIt was a huge risk,\u201d says Cooper, when I talk to him online (he\u2019s in Germany, directing The Pirates of Penzance). \u201cI remember the first time he told me he wanted me to play the lead swan. I thought he was just reversing everybody, so when he said there\u2019d still be a prince [as opposed to a princess], I wasn\u2019t sure. How\u2019s that going to work? I thought. Two men working together? I had a colleague at the Royal Ballet who came up to me and said, \u2018How dare you be a part of this? I hope you know what you\u2019re doing.\u2019 Some people thought of me as a bit of a Judas, doing something so anti-ballet. But of course, it\u2019s not anti-ballet. It celebrates the ballet, but in its own way.\u201d Before the opening night, he was nervous of the audience. \u201cAre they going to stand up and walk out?\u201d But in the event, what he felt mostly was relief. \u201cI could hear that people were loving it, but I was so overwhelmed, it didn\u2019t sink in until later, when it kept happening. The [noisy] curtain call, the queues. Oh my God, I thought. It\u2019s something else completely.\u201d There was a price to pay. In those days, Bourne had only one cast (now he has two, so dancers can rest). Cooper says that the part of the lead Swan involves \u201chuge stamina \u2026 it\u2019s an absolute killer because the choreography means you use every single part of your body, all the time.\u201d Quite soon, his body was so overworked, he broke his foot. But the upsides were by far more important than the downsides: the chance to perform in the West End; the recognition of the new audiences it brought to dance. And of course, he had originated the role, so there was a feeling, not of ownership precisely, but perhaps of pride. \u201cHistorically, ballet directors are these men with sticks, shouting, doing the counts. Matthew\u2019s not like that at all. He has a vision, but within that, he\u2019s interested in other people\u2019s ideas. He\u2019ll always say, \u2018What do you think?\u2019\u201d Isabel Mortimer, who danced the Queen in the first production, echoes all of this (her background, unlike Cooper\u2019s, was in contemporary dance; I meet her in London). \u201cWhat\u2019s amazing about Matthew is that he can see things in people; he focuses on what you can do, not on what you can\u2019t. He\u2019s a curator as much as a choreographer. You can contribute.\u201d In rehearsal for Swan Lake, she tells me, the cast was in a bubble. \u201cIt was only when some people started saying he shouldn\u2019t be allowed to touch this iconic piece that we became aware of what the first night might be like\u201d Like Cooper, the strain would eventually tell on her body; it\u2019s unheard of for ballerinas to dance as many performances she did then: \u201cWe had to cut whole dances [when people were injured] because we didn\u2019t have covers!\u201d But in the end, she did it for 10 years, on and off. \u201cIt was life-changing,\u201d she says. \u201cI coach dancers now, and one of the things I talk about is mastery, which is to do with flow, not adrenaline. It was Swan Lake that taught me about flow. My mind would blank out, but my body would do what it needed to.\u201d The last person in my Swan Lake jigsaw is Lez Brotherston, Bourne\u2019s longtime set and costume designer \u2013 and talking to him is great. Creative people sometimes struggle to explain their work to outsiders, but Brotherston is like Bourne: both of them talk easily about what they do, without snobbery (I can\u2019t help but connect this with the fact that Bourne thinks of himself as a storyteller who cares deeply about the experience of the audience). It is impossible now to imagine Swan Lake without Brotherston\u2019s costumes \u2013 a pair of swan legs is on permanent display in the V&amp;A. But like everything else to do with the production, at the time, his head was mostly full of questions. \u201cThe first was: why men? Matthew said, well, swans are feral. So then I thought, OK, we\u2019re talking masculine swans, so they\u2019ll certainly be topless, and I\u2019m assuming that bare feet is better than a jazz shoe. So then it was a case of: what kind of shorts are they wearing? Matthew had a picture of an Indian dancer in trousers that had bits of fringe on it, so I did a prototype along those lines, trousers with raggedy bits on them. In the end, the raggedy bits were silk, because when you wash it, it sort of goes like dreadlocks.\u201d Brotherston oversees every new production involving his designs, \u201cwhich is rare \u2026 I mean, I did Seven Deadly Sins with Martha Wainwright at the Royal Opera House in 2007, and when they revived it, the first I knew about it was an invite to a dress rehearsal.\u201d It can be dispiriting, bringing the Swan Lake costumes out: they\u2019re beaten up, ripped and mouldy. But 60 pairs of fresh legs have just been delivered, a moment he always finds peculiarly humbling: \u201cGosh, I think: a drawing that probably took me half-an-hour to do \u2026 and putting them on is a rite of passage for the dancers.\u201d As a young designer, he used to say he would know he had truly made it if he ever saw someone in fancy dress who\u2019d chosen one of his designs, \u00e0 la The Rocky Horror Show. \u201cAnd then it happened. I walked into a bar in New York. It had lots of photographs of its customers, and it had a Halloween night, and there were two guys dressed as swans. I was by myself having a drink. No one knew who I was. But I was so happy \u2013 my swans had made it.\u201d Matthew Bourne\u2019s Swan Lake: The Next Generation tours from 11 November until 7 June 2025. It is at Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, from 3 December to 26 January",

      "body": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theambassadorstheatre.co.uk/shows/the-curious-case-of-benjamin-button\">The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</a></strong> is very curious indeed. It began as a startling short story by F Scott Fitzgerald: a baby is born as an old man who becomes younger the longer he lives; when he is over 70 he seems to be an infant. <a href=\"https://www.jethrocomptonltd.co.uk/jethro\">Director Jethro Compton</a>, whose exhausting list of credits include not only composing the book and lyrics but creating the design, elaborated the plot and transplanted it from antebellum Baltimore to 20th-century Cornwall. Darren Clark added some lyrics and composed music inspired by Bellowhead, Laura Marling, Kate Rusby and sea shanties.</p> <p>This folk musical, brought to swarming life by actor-musicians, opened at the small, enterprising Southwark Playhouse Elephant five years ago; now it has landed in the West End \u2013 and taken over the Ambassadors. The theatre bar has become the Pickled Crab, and sells seasalt fudge; the walls outside the auditorium are papered with headlines about the <a href=\"https://rnli.org/about-us/our-history/timeline/1981-penlee-lifeboat-disaster\">Penlee lifeboat disaster</a> and other old Cornish news. More gumboots than glitz. Plenty of welly.</p> <p>The stage is rarely still or silent. The set, built from salvaged items washed ashore in north Cornwall, is busy with maritime life: wave-worn wood, bright orange buoys, nets slung from on high that catch lights like stars. From time to time in the background there is a tidal roar, the sound of rushing wind. Actor-musicians weave between each other \u2013 Chi-San Howard\u2019s choreography is dextrous \u2013 whisking around cornet, double bass, french horn, fiddle, ukulele, accordion like playthings; even the cello is bowed without touching the floor.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Ghost stories in the theatre need to be fed with creaks and groans and unexplained gusts of wind</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The dialogue has vivacious touches, not least in the mouth of a genial fisherman who keeps muddling his wise saws: \u201cI could do it with my mouth open.\u201d Still, the story is overcrammed \u2013 war, suicide, lost love, the death of a child, rediscovered love, terminal illness \u2013 and not always clear. Though John Dagleish is strong and touching in the title role \u2013 slowly unbending from his early days as a septuagenarian babe with a walking stick \u2013 there is no single knockout song that defines his or others characters. It\u2019s a wave-like movement, a constant musical surge \u2013 more jig than gig \u2013 that sweeps the evening along. Warmly. Curiously.</p> <p>This was an extraordinary week for people singlemindedly wrestling shows \u2013 not one-people shows, not shows all about themselves \u2013 on to the stage. Ch\u00e9 Walker, who in 2008 livened up the Globe no end with <em>The Frontline</em><em>,</em> has been working on his new play, which he directs and in which he acts, for 14 years. The title is a double clue to the fiery nature of what his characters do and what they feel.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://finboroughtheatre.co.uk/production/burnt-up-love/\">Burnt-Up Love</a></strong> looks at physical and emotional damage travelling down generations; it takes a good swipe at the prison system and at alpha males; it mingles warning and hope.

      "bodyText": "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is very curious indeed. It began as a startling short story by F Scott Fitzgerald: a baby is born as an old man who becomes younger the longer he lives; when he is over 70 he seems to be an infant. Director Jethro Compton, whose exhausting list of credits include not only composing the book and lyrics but creating the design, elaborated the plot and transplanted it from antebellum Baltimore to 20th-century Cornwall. Darren Clark added some lyrics and composed music inspired by Bellowhead, Laura Marling, Kate Rusby and sea shanties. This folk musical, brought to swarming life by actor-musicians, opened at the small, enterprising Southwark Playhouse Elephant five years ago; now it has landed in the West End \u2013 and taken over the Ambassadors. The theatre bar has become the Pickled Crab, and sells seasalt fudge; the walls outside the auditorium are papered with headlines about the Penlee lifeboat disaster and other old Cornish news. More gumboots than glitz. Plenty of welly. The stage is rarely still or silent. The set, built from salvaged items washed ashore in north Cornwall, is busy with maritime life: wave-worn wood, bright orange buoys, nets slung from on high that catch lights like stars. From time to time in the background there is a tidal roar, the sound of rushing wind. Actor-musicians weave between each other \u2013 Chi-San Howard\u2019s choreography is dextrous \u2013 whisking around cornet, double bass, french horn, fiddle, ukulele, accordion like playthings; even the cello is bowed without touching the floor. The dialogue has vivacious touches, not least in the mouth of a genial fisherman who keeps muddling his wise saws: \u201cI could do it with my mouth open.\u201d Still, the story is overcrammed \u2013 war, suicide, lost love, the death of a child, rediscovered love, terminal illness \u2013 and not always clear. Though John Dagleish is strong and touching in the title role \u2013 slowly unbending from his early days as a septuagenarian babe with a walking stick \u2013 there is no single knockout song that defines his or others characters. It\u2019s a wave-like movement, a constant musical surge \u2013 more jig than gig \u2013 that sweeps the evening along. Warmly. Curiously. This was an extraordinary week for people singlemindedly wrestling shows \u2013 not one-people shows, not shows all about themselves \u2013 on to the stage. Ch\u00e9 Walker, who in 2008 livened up the Globe no end with The Frontline, has been working on his new play, which he directs and in which he acts, for 14 years. The title is a double clue to the fiery nature of what his characters do and what they feel. Burnt-Up Love looks at physical and emotional damage travelling down generations; it takes a good swipe at the prison system and at alpha males; it mingles warning and hope. It is a glimpse rather than a full drama, often describing rather than showing its considerable action; but the description is crisp, and the result ferocious. Walker plays a man who after 20 years of imprisonment dreams of finding his daughter. He lingers, hunched in his overcoat, hovering between threat and blessing: \u201cI am human, but I disappear sometimes.\u201d Joanne Marie Mason is magnetic as the daughter \u2013 described as \u201cferal\u201d, called Scratch, subject to sudden affection and engulfing depression: \u201cStaring at some dust in the corner like it was an executioner.\u201d As the woman who becomes her lover, Alice (no relation to Ch\u00e9) Walker is exact and edgy. Newly composed music by Uchenna Ngwe and the actor and singer Sheila Atim is used throughout but understated: quiet pings and rumbles point up a scene. Meanwhile, if anyone wanted proof of what lighting can do to make a plot more apparent and the very breath of characters seem different, here it is.

      "body": "<p>As a dancer, Carlos Acosta had a generosity in the way he welcomed audiences into his world, exuding warmth and engagement. In creating <em><a href=\"https://norwichtheatre.org/whats-on/carlos-acostas-nutcracker-in-havana/\">Nutcracker in Havana</a></em>, a reimagining of a Christmas classic in a Cuban mode, he reveals exactly the same spirit.

With added snow.</p> <p>Premiering in the Norwich theatre that has co-produced this tour by <a href=\"https://www.acostadanza.com/en\">Acosta Danza</a> and guests, the show immediately whisks you (courtesy of designer Nina Dunn\u2019s videos) on an aerial tour of the capital and out through lush vegetation to a farm where an extended family are happily partying. The Drosselmeyer figure is Uncle Elias, returned from Miami, and played with a sparkling waistcoat and relaxed charisma by the wonderful Alexander Varona. He has a vintage Chevrolet that drives itself, and his magic tricks provide the partygoers with bright clothes, a bigger tree and a grand staircase.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A clog dance in sandals appears twice and once \u2013 oddly \u2013 a maypole</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s all a long way from bourgeoise Germany, yet <em>Nutcracker in Havana</em> keeps the shape of the traditional story while adding layers of energetic pizzazz. The key to its success lies in Pepe Gavilondo\u2019s Latin rearrangement of Tchaikovsky\u2019s score, full of blowsy horns and syncopated rhythms.

      "bodyText": "As a dancer, Carlos Acosta had a generosity in the way he welcomed audiences into his world, exuding warmth and engagement. In creating Nutcracker in Havana, a reimagining of a Christmas classic in a Cuban mode, he reveals exactly the same spirit. This new production is as sunny and relaxing as a day on a beach. With added snow. Premiering in the Norwich theatre that has co-produced this tour by Acosta Danza and guests, the show immediately whisks you (courtesy of designer Nina Dunn\u2019s videos) on an aerial tour of the capital and out through lush vegetation to a farm where an extended family are happily partying. The Drosselmeyer figure is Uncle Elias, returned from Miami, and played with a sparkling waistcoat and relaxed charisma by the wonderful Alexander Varona. He has a vintage Chevrolet that drives itself, and his magic tricks provide the partygoers with bright clothes, a bigger tree and a grand staircase. It\u2019s all a long way from bourgeoise Germany, yet Nutcracker in Havana keeps the shape of the traditional story while adding layers of energetic pizzazz. The key to its success lies in Pepe Gavilondo\u2019s Latin rearrangement of Tchaikovsky\u2019s score, full of blowsy horns and syncopated rhythms. The choreography is the same blend of the classical \u2013 rosy-pink flowers waltzing on pointe; a complete Sugar Plum variation (danced with airy insouciance and confident fish dives by the guesting Laurretta Summerscales) \u2013 with Cuban and even some contemporary moves. Martial art-style ducking and diving provides showstopping dance for Leandro Fern\u00e1ndez and Brandy Mart\u00ednez in the second-act Land of Sweets; a clog dance in sandals appears twice and once \u2013 oddly \u2013 a maypole. It\u2019s not always entirely coherent, but it is consistent fun, powered not only by its own innate good humour but by Laura Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s smiling Clara, enjoying her dream just as much as the audience. I am not a Nutcracker fan, but this version kept me happy from beginning to end. It\u2019s short and very, very sweet. Carlos Acosta\u2019s Nutcracker in Havana tours the UK until 28 January 2025",

      "body": "<p>\u201cWhen Trump first won, there was almost a novelty to having a character such as him in a position of such vast responsibility \u2013 that was a new thing for comedy to address,\u201d said Andy Zaltzman, chair of Radio 4\u2019s <em>The News Quiz</em> and the satirist behind <em>The Bugle</em> podcast and multiple political comedies.</p> <p>The first Trump presidency spawned debate about whether it\u2019s possible to satirise a man whose extreme appearance and rhetoric mean he presents as a walking caricature. The <em>New York Times</em> even ran a piece titled \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/magazine/trump-liberal-comedy-tv.html\">How President Trump ruined political comedy</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Now comedians in the UK and US are trying to work out how to deal with a second, possibly darker, Trump presidency.</p> <p>\u201cTrump is so ridiculous that he makes comic extrapolation harder,\u201d said Chicago-born, London-based standup Sara Barron, who found much of the comedy targeting Trump \u201cdid not provide catharsis\u201d.</p> <p>Zaltzman has just embarked on a tour and, post-election, is writing new jokes exploring the global implications. Trump\u2019s absurdity means there are obvious punchlines, \u201cbut it can be harder to get to the heart of the issue\u201d, Zaltzman said. </p> <p>\u201cComedy is so ubiquitous \u2013 anything that happens, there\u2019ll be a thousand memes and TikToks. The challenge is finding an original angle.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhen Trump first won, there was almost a novelty to having a character such as him in a position of such vast responsibility \u2013 that was a new thing for comedy to address,\u201d said Andy Zaltzman, chair of Radio 4\u2019s The News Quiz and the satirist behind The Bugle podcast and multiple political comedies. The first Trump presidency spawned debate about whether it\u2019s possible to satirise a man whose extreme appearance and rhetoric mean he presents as a walking caricature. The New York Times even ran a piece titled \u201cHow President Trump ruined political comedy\u201d. Now comedians in the UK and US are trying to work out how to deal with a second, possibly darker, Trump presidency. \u201cTrump is so ridiculous that he makes comic extrapolation harder,\u201d said Chicago-born, London-based standup Sara Barron, who found much of the comedy targeting Trump \u201cdid not provide catharsis\u201d. Zaltzman has just embarked on a tour and, post-election, is writing new jokes exploring the global implications. Trump\u2019s absurdity means there are obvious punchlines, \u201cbut it can be harder to get to the heart of the issue\u201d, Zaltzman said. \u201cComedy is so ubiquitous \u2013 anything that happens, there\u2019ll be a thousand memes and TikToks. The challenge is finding an original angle. That\u2019s always been difficult with Trump.\u201d Previously, Zaltzman\u2019s solution was presenting Trump\u2019s brain (a cauliflower) on stage, using chopped-up Trump speeches to make it \u201cspeak\u201d about Australian cricketers: \u201cI figured no one else would be taking that angle.\u201d In the run-up to election day, Barron found a personal angle.

      "body": "<p>Since 2018, Olivia Williams has grown more blunt than she used to be. \u201cI\u2019m a bit less scared of the consequences of saying what I think,\u201d she explains. The actor has never been particularly shy about speaking her mind, as a trawl through any of her old interviews, from the <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/18/rushmore-comedy\">Rushmore </a></em>days in the late 1990s to her more recent red carpet duties for <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-crown\">The Crown</a></em>, will reveal. But in the last few years, she has become less inhibited, for reasons we will get on to shortly. \u201cBecause how bad can it be?\u201d she says, with a droll laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re going to die, so it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>Williams has positioned herself on the furthest possible edge of an enormous sofa in a posh London hotel. Her parents were both barristers and she is very precise with words. \u201cI\u2019m really, really particular and I\u2019m afraid I will be with you,\u201d she says. This translates to a no-nonsense and crisply funny conversation \u2013 she leaves the impression that she does not suffer fools gladly. She hates being misquoted and still remembers, in the early 00s, when a journalist asked her how she felt about Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow taking theatre parts in London. Williams had said she didn\u2019t care. She was in Hollywood at the time, playing American characters in American films. But the story came out differently: \u201cGwyneth muscling in on our roles.\u201d In her retelling of it today, she calls the journalist a \u201cfuckwit\u201d, before adding, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t say that. I\u2019m not being very guarded.\u201d</p> <p>We are here to talk about her latest role, in <em>Dune: Prophecy</em>, a big-budget series that is a prequel to the recent films. Williams\u2019s old friend Emily Watson stars with her, as leader of a nascent, nunlike sect of women, who have supernatural, sometimes violent abilities and world-conquering ambitions. It sounds as if Williams was not immediately wowed by the prospect of joining the <em>Dune</em> juggernaut.</p> <p>\u201cI had my suspicions about feminist TV based on a novel written by a bloke in the 60s,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd there are some elements that are very based in the patriarchy. There\u2019s this fascination of, what do women get up to when men aren\u2019t around, and what kind of wisdom is it that men are frightened of? They seem frightened we can read their minds, or know when they\u2019re telling the truth or lying.\u201d</p>    <p>A talking-point TV series with two women in their 50s at its centre feels like a world away from the relatively recent conversations about whether a woman could still get a decent role once she had turned 35. \u201cAll the progress of that question is really important,\u201d says Williams, who is 56. \u201cIt\u2019s not cured, it\u2019s not better, like so many things, it\u2019s just different. The bollocks is just coming at you from a different direction. The idea that JK Rowling had to use her initials so that people didn\u2019t know she was a woman, because boys wouldn\u2019t read the books if they thought they were written by a girl \u2013 there is still a bit of that going on.\u201d</p> <p>As a woman, she says, she is interested in stories about men written by men. \u201cBut it is an achievement to put a show out there and see if everybody is interested in a story led by two middle-aged women, neither of whom are trading on the fact that they look 25. I mean, we are noticeable and possibly unique, Emily and I, in that neither of us has had any work done. Obviously, I\u2019ve had quite a lot of surgical work, but for medical reasons rather than vanity.\u201d Part of the reason she\u2019s been resistant, she explains, is that \u201cI\u2019m not looking to have any surgery that I don\u2019t require to stay alive.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>In 2014, Williams</strong></em> went to the doctor with what she calls \u201ca symptom\u201d, but it wasn\u2019t until four years later, in 2018, that she was diagnosed with \u201cquite an obscure cancer, called neuroendocrine cancer\u201d. Does she mind talking about it? \u201cNo, we need to get it out there,\u201d she says. She was working on an underrated TV thriller, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/nov/22/counterpart-this-cerebral-rip-roaring-spy-fi-series-forces-us-to-look-in-the-mirror\">Counterpart</a></em> (\u201cmuch neglected\u201d), when she first became \u201cso ill that something had to be done\u201d. Neuroendocrine cancer is rare, slow-growing and hard to diagnose, and it can appear anywhere in the digestive tract. \u201cMine was in my pancreas. It can be in your bladder. It can be in your bowel. But it grows very, very slowly, and then one day, the tumour just gets too big and gets in the way of something else. And that\u2019s when you go to the doctor again, and again and again, going, no, there\u2019s really something wrong, and they take note, by which stage it\u2019s usually metastasised, which is the fuck-up.\u201d</p> <p>And that\u2019s what happened to you? \u201cYeah. It was quite obviously bad news to find I had a 7x4cm tumour in my pancreas, but it was really fucking awful news that it had gone to my liver, which is the problem now. The primary cancer they cut out hasn\u2019t come back. I have a third of a functioning pancreas, which is great, but the liver ones keep popping up.\u201d She says that, as I can see, she is fine, she works, she eats and drinks, she lives a normal life. \u201cBut every now and then I have to zap these metastases.\u201d So far, they haven\u2019t turned up anywhere other than her liver. She says this while touching the table, a sideboard, all the wood she can see, \u201cbut they could do any time. I am this new thing, which I think is going to be very common, which is living with cancer.\u201d The treatments are improving all the time. \u201cAnd, you know, there is a certain sense of, \u2018Can you hurry up and find the one that gets rid of it?\u2019\u201d</p>    <p>There are practical concerns involved in living with cancer. As an actor, it is standard to be insured for every production, but now those assessments sound much more nightmarish. \u201cMy insurance meetings are hilarious. They don\u2019t look at you. They don\u2019t see you. They don\u2019t take it from the doctor that you\u2019re a walking, talking human being. They\u2019re just on to the oncologist every day, going, \u2018How can you guarantee that this person isn\u2019t going to die during production?\u2019\u201d She laughs, but it sounds dehumanising. \u201cCompletely.\u201d</p> <p>More philosophically, has it changed how she approaches life? \u201cI\u2019m a great believer in denial. I think that\u2019s how I\u2019m coping.\u201d This is where the bluntness comes in. \u201cI think I am a bit more courageous in that I\u2019m a bit more blunt.\u201d People in a similar position will tell her that they\u2019ve managed to \u201cshake off the trivial\u201d, but she still worries about making sure the recycling is sorted properly. \u201cI haven\u2019t managed to clear the decks of my life. I don\u2019t pursue things that are only true or beautiful. I wish I had developed enough disinhibition to not care about things. I feel a bit like Gulliver, pinned down by a thousand tiny pins of life.\u201d When she was first diagnosed, she asked her oncologist if she should cash in her pension. \u201cHe said, \u2018No, don\u2019t. You might make it through,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cSo I don\u2019t get to have that sort of countdown.\u201d She has been doing this for 10 years. \u201cBut I\u2019d say since 2018, I feel the disinhibition kicked in.\u201d</p> <p>And yet it doesn\u2019t seem like that was ever a problem? She laughs. \u201cSo watch out, because I\u2019m even more disinhibited, or less inhibited, than I was.\u201d She once called her experience of filming two episodes of <em>Friends </em>\u201charrowing\u201d and said she narrowly escaped them plucking off her eyebrows; she described being chased around a hotel room by Harvey Weinstein as like \u201ca badly rehearsed Benny Hill sketch\u201d; for years, she has spoken out about pay disparity, and today, at times, she sounds like a union rep, advocating for better labour conditions for actors. On a film set, in costume, she explains, you become \u201cinfantilised\u201d. You can\u2019t tie your own shoelaces in a corset, for example. \u201cYou cannot behave as an independent thinking, moving, being. You can\u2019t carry money, you can\u2019t leave the set, you can\u2019t go to the loo. You literally have to ask permission of a teenager with a walkie-talkie to go and take a shit. I mean, it is really a very strange thing.\u201d</p> <p>But she loves this very strange thing. When Williams was at school, she wanted to be a dancer, but she grew too tall. \u201cI wasn\u2019t good enough and I was the wrong shape and size. And rather than try to make myself the right shape and size, I was just like, \u2018Oh, fuck, I\u2019ll do something else then.\u2019 I could see the path of eating disorder and self-loathing, or I could just celebrate my height and my bum, and do something else.\u201d Williams\u2019s eldest daughter (she has two, with her husband, the actor and writer Rhashan Stone) is now training to be a dancer in the US. \u201cHow can I possibly tell her to do something more sensible than I do? She loves it and she dances beautifully,\u201d she says.</p>    <p>Williams spent most of her 20s as a jobbing actor, doing obscure Restoration plays at the Royal Shakespeare Company, coincidentally, where she first met Watson. She once said that she couldn\u2019t get a part on <em>The Bill</em> and set herself a limit: by 30, she decided, if it still wasn\u2019t working, then she would give up acting and do something sensible, like law, as her parents and sister did. Then at 29, Kevin Costner came along, and cast her in <em>The Postman</em>, a film that was both a big deal and a big flop, but which launched her career in Hollywood. She followed it up with <em>Rushmore</em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/06/the-sixth-sense-at-20-m-night-shyamalan-bruce-willis\">The Sixth Sense</a></em>, catching the last wave of great 1990s cinema. \u201cIt makes you sort of bulletproof, if you love what you\u2019re doing,\u201d she says.</p> <p>What is it that she loves? \u201cThere\u2019s so much about ADD and ADHD and concentration, and I am very distractible. I have no idea if I have any of these neurological conditions, but it is the <em>focus </em>of it. You may <em>not </em>be distracted. I remember when I did <em>The Sixth Sense</em> there was this scene where I was having a lovely evening with Bruce Willis after a glass of wine. As an acting aide, [director] M. Night Shyamalan had got permission to fire a gunshot on the set to shock me.\u201d The gun went off. \u201cI heard the bang and I just kept acting. My focus is on doing what I\u2019ve been directed to do and not to be distracted by a gun.\u201d Her co-star, Donnie Wahlberg, was standing there semi-naked with a smoking gun in his hand. She was not expecting him, so she just ignored him. \u201cThey all thought I was fucking insane. But when I\u2019m acting, I can tune out a gunshot quite close to my head.\u201d</p> <p>For chaos of a different kind, Williams saw out the end of <em>The Crown</em>, as Camilla Parker Bowles to Dominic West\u2019s Prince Charles. <em>The Crown</em> had become a tabloid fixture and a headline magnet. Was she ever reluctant to sign up to that circus? \u201cNo!\u201d she laughs. \u201cThis is awful, and my awfulness will be revealed, but I was slightly like, \u2018Why did it take them until season five to come to me?\u2019 I talk posh. I was a fully paid-up signee to the <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/nov/26/piecrusts-and-pearls-how-a-young-diana-spread-the-sloane-ranger-look\">Sloane Ranger Handbook</a></em>.\u201d She grew up in London, in Camden, and went to Cambridge but, she says, she was never full Sloane.</p> <p>\u201cI was torn between Siouxsie and the Banshees and the <em>Sloane Ranger Handbook</em>. One day I would be collar up and pearly lipstick on, down at the Admiral Codrington [a pub in Chelsea] trying to drink beer with people who went to public school. This is when I was still experimenting \u2013 well, I still am \u2013 with who I was, but then I\u2019d be down Camden Lock in my bullet belt, with my badly dyed hair.\u201d I\u2019d like to see pictures. \u201cI\u2019ve got them all. It\u2019s all recorded.\u201d</p>    <p><em><strong>Dune: Prophecy</strong></em><strong> </strong><em><strong>is set</strong></em> in the immediate aftermath of a brutal war between humans and the banned \u201cthinking machines\u201d, which sound a lot like AI. Williams recently signed a big creative industry petition against the threat posed to artists\u2019 livelihoods by AI, which trains itself, for free, on existing material. \u201cI want to get on to some AI issues,\u201d she says, briskly. \u201cClause 18 of 18 pages of special stipulations in most contracts that come from America says the producer owns your likeness, as defined by the producer, on any platform now existing or yet to be devised throughout the universe, in perpetuity.\u201d If that sounds like madness, then it gets worse. \u201cWhen I say to my American attorney, \u2018What the fuck?\u2019 he goes, \u2018Oh, don\u2019t worry, Olivia, they\u2019ll never enforce it.\u2019 And so actors sign these things, and if your agent objects, business affairs go, we\u2019re moving on, we\u2019ll go find someone new. It\u2019s corporate bullying.\u201d Ever the daughter of lawyers, she says it wouldn\u2019t stand up in court. \u201cBut who can afford to take Netflix, HBO, Warner Brothers to court? Who\u2019s going to do that?\u201d</p> <p>I think if you had to choose an actor to fight your corner, then Williams, no-nonsense daughter of barristers, outspoken, increasingly blunt and fearless, would be the one to pick.</p> <p>\u201cI was raised to be precise, yeah,\u201d she says. \u201cSecond nature.\u201d </p> <p><em>Dune: Prophecy will be available from 18 November on Sky and Now</em></p> <p><em>Stylist Hope Lawrie;</em> <em>hair and makeup Ciona Johnson-King at Aartlondon using Oxygenetix, Elf and Color Wow</em></p>",

Williams spent most of her 20s as a jobbing actor, doing obscure Restoration plays at the Royal Shakespeare Company, coincidentally, where she first met Watson. She once said that she couldn\u2019t get a part on The Bill and set herself a limit: by 30, she decided, if it still wasn\u2019t working, then she would give up acting and do something sensible, like law, as her parents and sister did. Then at 29, Kevin Costner came along, and cast her in The Postman, a film that was both a big deal and a big flop, but which launched her career in Hollywood. She followed it up with Rushmore and The Sixth Sense, catching the last wave of great 1990s cinema. \u201cIt makes you sort of bulletproof, if you love what you\u2019re doing,\u201d she says. What is it that she loves? \u201cThere\u2019s so much about ADD and ADHD and concentration, and I am very distractible. I have no idea if I have any of these neurological conditions, but it is the focus of it. You may not be distracted. I remember when I did The Sixth Sense there was this scene where I was having a lovely evening with Bruce Willis after a glass of wine. As an acting aide, [director] M. Night Shyamalan had got permission to fire a gunshot on the set to shock me.\u201d The gun went off. \u201cI heard the bang and I just kept acting. My focus is on doing what I\u2019ve been directed to do and not to be distracted by a gun.\u201d Her co-star, Donnie Wahlberg, was standing there semi-naked with a smoking gun in his hand. She was not expecting him, so she just ignored him. \u201cThey all thought I was fucking insane. But when I\u2019m acting, I can tune out a gunshot quite close to my head.\u201d For chaos of a different kind, Williams saw out the end of The Crown, as Camilla Parker Bowles to Dominic West\u2019s Prince Charles. The Crown had become a tabloid fixture and a headline magnet. Was she ever reluctant to sign up to that circus? \u201cNo!\u201d she laughs. \u201cThis is awful, and my awfulness will be revealed, but I was slightly like, \u2018Why did it take them until season five to come to me?\u2019 I talk posh. I was a fully paid-up signee to the Sloane Ranger Handbook.\u201d She grew up in London, in Camden, and went to Cambridge but, she says, she was never full Sloane. \u201cI was torn between Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Sloane Ranger Handbook. One day I would be collar up and pearly lipstick on, down at the Admiral Codrington [a pub in Chelsea] trying to drink beer with people who went to public school. This is when I was still experimenting \u2013 well, I still am \u2013 with who I was, but then I\u2019d be down Camden Lock in my bullet belt, with my badly dyed hair.\u201d I\u2019d like to see pictures. \u201cI\u2019ve got them all. It\u2019s all recorded.\u201d Dune: Prophecy is set in the immediate aftermath of a brutal war between humans and the banned \u201cthinking machines\u201d, which sound a lot like AI. Williams recently signed a big creative industry petition against the threat posed to artists\u2019 livelihoods by AI, which trains itself, for free, on existing material. \u201cI want to get on to some AI issues,\u201d she says, briskly. \u201cClause 18 of 18 pages of special stipulations in most contracts that come from America says the producer owns your likeness, as defined by the producer, on any platform now existing or yet to be devised throughout the universe, in perpetuity.\u201d If that sounds like madness, then it gets worse. \u201cWhen I say to my American attorney, \u2018What the fuck?\u2019 he goes, \u2018Oh, don\u2019t worry, Olivia, they\u2019ll never enforce it.\u2019 And so actors sign these things, and if your agent objects, business affairs go, we\u2019re moving on, we\u2019ll go find someone new. It\u2019s corporate bullying.\u201d Ever the daughter of lawyers, she says it wouldn\u2019t stand up in court. \u201cBut who can afford to take Netflix, HBO, Warner Brothers to court? Who\u2019s going to do that?\u201d I think if you had to choose an actor to fight your corner, then Williams, no-nonsense daughter of barristers, outspoken, increasingly blunt and fearless, would be the one to pick. \u201cI was raised to be precise, yeah,\u201d she says. \u201cSecond nature.\u201d Dune: Prophecy will be available from 18 November on Sky and Now Stylist Hope Lawrie; hair and makeup Ciona Johnson-King at Aartlondon using Oxygenetix, Elf and Color Wow",

      "body": "<p>The British actor Emily Watson made one of the outstanding film debuts when she starred in Lars Von Trier\u2019s <em>Breaking the Waves</em> in 1996, aged 29. She was Oscar-nominated for that role, then again two years later for playing the cellist Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9 in <em>Hilary and Jackie</em>. She is known for her fierce, fearless performances: she won a Bafta for her part as a social worker in <em>Appropriate Adult</em>, ITV\u2019s 2011 Fred West drama, and received Emmy and Golden Globe nods for the Sky Atlantic miniseries <em>Chernobyl</em>. Watson is 57 and lives in south London with her husband and two children.</p> <p><strong>When you got an Oscar nomination for your first film, did you find it a lot to take in?</strong><br>I was very, very green and I was just going where I was told.

In a good way, I think.</p> <p><strong>In your new film, </strong><em><strong>Small Things Like These</strong></em><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>(an adaptation of Claire Keegan\u2019s novella), you have an intense scene with </strong><strong>Cillian Murphy</strong><strong>.

Why did the cow cross the road, he\u2019ll ask, poised and trembling with glee. To get to the udder side, he answers, before I even have time to respond. The secret of comedy may be timing, but for my son this merely means speed is the order of the day. That he delivers the above line while stroking imaginary udders on his belly, only adds to the efficiency of this process. (Edinburgh comics take note).</p> <p>But it is in natural speech where he has become most hilarious. This week he told me he wanted a pet: a cat first and then a dog, because he\u2019s still a little scared of dogs and believes that, by some transitive property he wouldn\u2019t expound on further, having a cat around would help him acclimatise to dog ownership. He caveated this immediately by soberly telling me that cats themselves posed difficulties, specifically when it came to feeding. \u2018How so?\u2019 I asked \u2013 curious, since he has never spent more than five minutes in feline company. \u2018Well,\u2019 he said, with a weary sigh that suggested this was a dilemma which has cursed his every waking hour, \u2018cats really are fish-crazed.\u2019</p> <p>I don\u2019t know why this made me laugh so much, and he certainly didn\u2019t. I suppose it was just the absurdly blank specificity of this declaration, alloyed with the sheer joy of a small ginger six-year-old casually using hyphenated adjectives regarding a situation he can never have experienced in real life.</p> <p>Nothing, however, has made me laugh more than his latest adventures in writing. He wrote a new book this week (four sheets of A4 paper, folded and stapled to provide a 16-page tome) about his favourite Minecraft Lego set, complete with author\u2019s biography and a page at the end advertising other, entirely notional, books in that same series.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t see why we found that funny either; the falsified ISBN and publication data on the inside sleeve; his itemised list of Also By This Author thumbnails, breathlessly detailed in tiny handwriting; and, gloriously, the fact that he referred to each with captions indicating whether they were \u2018common\u2019, \u2018rare\u2019 or \u2018super rare\u2019, so that avid collectors can judge their chances of completing a full set. I\u2019m biased, but it is, by some distance, the funniest book I\u2019ve ever read. But then, kids do write the darnedest things.</p> <p><em>Follow S\u00e9amas on X <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shockproofbeats?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@shockproofbeats</a></em></p>",

Why did the cow cross the road, he\u2019ll ask, poised and trembling with glee. To get to the udder side, he answers, before I even have time to respond. The secret of comedy may be timing, but for my son this merely means speed is the order of the day. That he delivers the above line while stroking imaginary udders on his belly, only adds to the efficiency of this process. (Edinburgh comics take note). But it is in natural speech where he has become most hilarious. This week he told me he wanted a pet: a cat first and then a dog, because he\u2019s still a little scared of dogs and believes that, by some transitive property he wouldn\u2019t expound on further, having a cat around would help him acclimatise to dog ownership. He caveated this immediately by soberly telling me that cats themselves posed difficulties, specifically when it came to feeding. \u2018How so?\u2019 I asked \u2013 curious, since he has never spent more than five minutes in feline company. \u2018Well,\u2019 he said, with a weary sigh that suggested this was a dilemma which has cursed his every waking hour, \u2018cats really are fish-crazed.\u2019 I don\u2019t know why this made me laugh so much, and he certainly didn\u2019t. I suppose it was just the absurdly blank specificity of this declaration, alloyed with the sheer joy of a small ginger six-year-old casually using hyphenated adjectives regarding a situation he can never have experienced in real life. Nothing, however, has made me laugh more than his latest adventures in writing. He wrote a new book this week (four sheets of A4 paper, folded and stapled to provide a 16-page tome) about his favourite Minecraft Lego set, complete with author\u2019s biography and a page at the end advertising other, entirely notional, books in that same series. He couldn\u2019t see why we found that funny either; the falsified ISBN and publication data on the inside sleeve; his itemised list of Also By This Author thumbnails, breathlessly detailed in tiny handwriting; and, gloriously, the fact that he referred to each with captions indicating whether they were \u2018common\u2019, \u2018rare\u2019 or \u2018super rare\u2019, so that avid collectors can judge their chances of completing a full set. I\u2019m biased, but it is, by some distance, the funniest book I\u2019ve ever read. But then, kids do write the darnedest things. Follow S\u00e9amas on X @shockproofbeats",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s 25 January 1504, and so cold in Florence that the Arno river is about to freeze over. Thirty men meet in an icy room to decide where to position a giant statue of a little hero somewhere outdoors in public view. Among them are Botticelli, Leonardo and Filippino Lippi, who will be dead only weeks later and has already had to concede a substantial commission to the more famous Leonardo, currently working on the <em>Mona Lisa</em>. The statue is Michelangelo\u2019s <em>David</em>, and it will take four days to drag it, upright, to the most prominent square in the city.</p> <p>Raphael arrives in Florence a few weeks later, possibly from Siena, at the age of 21. He sees the enormous figure, and he draws it. And looking at this nimble image in brown ink, now hanging in the Royal Academy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/michelangelo-leonardo-raphael\">small but potent exhibition</a>, you see through Raphael\u2019s eyes for a moment. He stands behind this most familiar of all statues, noticing the extreme musculature so strenuously recorded in Carrara marble; and he corrects it, ever so slightly, scaling down the outsize hands.</p>    <p>There are only 40 or so works in this show, not counting some very telling documents, but they give the most exhilarating sense of this trio of titans looking over each other\u2019s shoulders, selecting and plundering with rivalrous intent. The connections between Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael (born 1452, 1475 and 1483 respectively) become so animate that one has a sense of each man\u2019s mind and eyes at work in Florence.</p> <p>Michelangelo\u2019s earliest surviving teenage drawings are here, copying a couple of figures from a Giotto he has seen in the church of Santa Croce. He gives one of them, not incidentally, those muckle hands. Later, during the Florentine craze for circular images (tondos), he paints the <em><a href=\"https://www.uffizi.it/en/artworks/holy-family-known-as-the-doni-tondo\">Doni Tondo</a></em> \u2013 Mary twisting diagonally backwards to baby Jesus, wriggling on Joseph\u2019s thigh \u2013 and sculpts the <em><a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/article/how-to-read-it-michelangelo-taddei-tondo\">Taddei Tondo</a></em> relief, where Jesus corkscrews sideways out of Mary\u2019s lap \u2013 for a prominent Florentine patron.</p> <p>To see this huge marble disc \u2013 unfinished, its every chisel mark laid bare \u2013 beside Michelangelo\u2019s wild drawings of babies is to sense the affinities between circularity and torsion for him. This is the way the eye moves, round and around, constantly restless as both sculpture and drawings. It\u2019s the way Michelangelo turns the page, drawing these sturdy infants so that they seem to be almost dancing and flying.</p> <p>Raphael, at the Casa Taddei for work, makes sketches of the tondo. His babies are more cherubic than Michelangelo\u2019s; they will eventually become angels.</p> <p>Raphael also draws Leonardo\u2019s <em>Mona Lisa</em>, and his painting of <em><a href=\"https://www.rct.uk/collection/912759/leda-and-the-swan\">Leda and the Swan</a></em> (now lost), making them saner and sweeter. This show makes a dramatic virtue of invisible art, in fact: the lost, unmade and incomplete. The city commissioned paintings of two Florentine victories from Leonardo and Michelangelo \u2013 the battles of Anghiari and Cascina \u2013 that neither artist ever actually fulfilled. But their drawings appear here in a showdown of staggering action, flailing soldiers and scattering horses.</p> <p>The central gallery rises to a beautiful climax. In something like chapel conditions, you sit before Leonardo\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/leonardo-da-vinci-the-burlington-house-cartoon\">vast and mysterious drawing</a> of the Virgin, Saint Anne, Saint John and the infant Christ, its sheer scale more striking than ever, given the small drawings around it. The curators point out that it was almost four times larger than the <em>Mona Lisa</em>, on which Leonardo was also working in the studio. You are on eye level with rocky ground and bare feet, with the overlaps between the many glued-together pages, with the smoothings and rubbings of charcoal and chalk, rising to Anne\u2019s spectral face and upward-pointing hand. You see it both as graphic act and magnificent vision.</p>    <p>A direct sightline back and forth to Michelangelo\u2019s tondo puts the emphasis on the epicentre of each work. Where Michelangelo puts Christ\u2019s navel at the circle\u2019s centre \u2013 so that everything whirls around his original connection with his mother \u2013 so Leonardo carries the point even further. The Virgin\u2019s hand cups Christ\u2019s navel even as he twists away in her lap, leaning towards baby John, whom he is blessing.</p> <p>The cartoon was not used as a template for some painting that Leonardo, typically, never got round to making. It is too grand and complete a wonder in itself. The curators\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2024/11/01/leonardo-cartoon-was-presentation-drawing-in-florence-commission-bid\">radical new proposal</a> seems, in this context, completely convincing. This is surely the drawing that Vasari writes about, displayed in a Florentine church: a work of art so remarkable that \u201cmen and women, young and old, continued for two days to flock for a sight of it\u2026 which caused all those people to be amazed\u201d.</p> <p>Anyone wondering how these artists drew with such precision and grace, without even the benefit of a sharp pencil, should go if they can to a magnificent parallel show across St James\u2019s Park at the King\u2019s Gallery. <strong><a href=\"https://www.rct.uk/collection/exhibitions/drawing-the-italian-renaissance/the-kings-gallery-buckingham-palace\">Drawing the Italian Renaissance</a></strong> selects 158 images from the 2,000 and more in the Royal Collection, to show the hand and imagination at work. It opens with sheaves of the coloured paper Renaissance artists used, and a fetchingly intimate drawing of a lad labouring away on such a page, a dog fast asleep beside him.</p>    <p>Raphael\u2019s Leda reappears here as a different character, along with a gracefully self-conscious nude (he was one of very few Renaissance artists to work from female models, unless they were lovers). Michelangelo\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.rct.uk/collection/912768/the-risen-christ\">Risen Christ</a></em> soars up the page in an electrifying leap. Leonardo draws southern Italy from high above, like a living map of land and cobalt sea, as if he were circling up there with the eagles.</p> <p>Making is as significant as meaning in this show. Here is a girl in profile, pricked out with holes through which powdered chalk was pressed to make the outline for a wedding portrait. Here is silver stylus for metalpoint drawings, sticks of charcoal dipped in linseed oil for extra blackness, quills sharpened at especially fine angles. There are designs for silver salvers, bookplates and candelabra as well as sketches of living people.</p> <p>The show\u2019s choreography is superb, moving fluidly from portrait to imaginary head, lily to spreading bush, solo figure to grappling pair, one lifting the other higher and higher up successive pages. Variations of character, in both subject and style, are in constant play. Renaissance drawings can be so fugitive, in white chalk on blue paper, or so nuanced in red on orange; so rigorous, stark or shocking, so comical or tender.</p>    <p>A lobster, by Annibale Carracci, tries to work a nutcracker with its own claws. Leonardo imagines a dog captaining a ship with an oak tree for a mast; Titian a big and foolish ostrich. Parmigianino draws a bust of Julius Caesar, like any art student down the centuries, and the emperor resembles a management consultant.</p> <p>There are possibly twice as many images as the teeming brain can take, especially in the later galleries, but also quiet places where you can sit down and draw. For the whole exhibition is conceived in the true Renaissance spirit, knowledge to the fore. What a bear\u2019s foot looks like, or the womb of a pregnant cow; how the fringe falls on a boy\u2019s turning head, or the veil over a girl\u2019s coiled plait; how Jesus might hand a heavy key down to a kneeling apostle: seeing, thinking, inquiring, imagining \u2013 and all of it drawn in the living present tense.</p> <p><em>Star ratings (out of five)<br>Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael </em>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<em><br>Drawing the Italian Renaissance </em>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/michelangelo-leonardo-raphael\">Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael: Florence, c.1504</a> is at the Royal Academy, London, until 16 February 2025</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.rct.uk/collection/exhibitions/drawing-the-italian-renaissance/the-kings-gallery-buckingham-palace\">Drawing the Italian Renaissance</a> is at the King\u2019s Gallery, Buckingham Palace, London, until 9 March 2025</p></li> </ul>",

I don\u2019t want to be captain just for the presentation or toss, I\u2019m open to suggestions from everyone, the older players, the younger players and the backroom staff. \u201cI\u2019ll give all the credit to the bowlers. Australia in Australia is not easy. But Saim and Abdullah have given us a couple of great starts, too. The fans love us regardless of whether we win or lose and I really appreciate that.\u201d A rueful and double disappointed Josh Inglis is up next: \u201cA pretty disappointing performance\u201d he says. \u201cWe were completely outplayed. It\u2019s up to us to get through tough periods. Really cool experience captaining Australia but a pretty disappointing series.\u201d Haris Rauf is garlanded: This means a lot to Pakistan because we\u2019ve been struggling a lot for the last few months\u201d Rauf says. \u201cWe\u2019re playing for the fans who come to the ground every time to support us. We\u2019ve been practicing a lot the past few weeks, talking among the fast bowlers, communicating well, and it\u2019s paying off.\u201d Wonderful scenes in Perth as Pakistan\u2019s players do a victory lap and their fans celebrate in the stands. Players and spectators are soaking in this victory and rightly so, it\u2019s been two decades and more since their last ODI series win on Australian turf. With a lot of balls remaining (139 balls to be precise). Zampa serves up a full toss and Babar pulls away to the fence to deliver the coup de grace! THAT\u2019S IT! A turbulent and tough year for Pakistan cricket is finishing on a high. A Test series win against England at home is followed up by a white ball series victory against Australia in the Aussie back yard. Ever keen to get a narrative going, they came from behind on both occasions too. 26th over: Pakistan 137-2 (Babar 23, Rizwan 29) Rizwan in a hurry! A shimmy down the pitch and Hardie is clattered for SIX back over his head. Another charge down the wicket from the heavily lip zinced batter, smears this through midwicket for four. Fourteen runs off the over and Pakistan one hit away from finishing off Australia and claiming a famous series win Down Under. 25th over: Pakistan 123-2 (Babar 22, Rizwan 16) Pakistan reach the halfway stage and are left with just 18 runs to get. Not like Michael Vaughan to chirrup up with an opinion eh? 24th over: Pakistan 120-2 (Babar 21, Rizwan 14) Hold the pose! Babar drives Morris down the ground for four to start the over and then bookends with another beautiful on drive off the last ball. No finer sight. 23rd over: Pakistan 11o-2 (Babar 12, Rizwan 13) Now then! Rizwan decides to chance his arm, skipping down the pitch to Abbott and depositing over mid on for SIX! 22nd over: Pakistan 101-2 (Babar 9, Rizwan 7) Rizwan pulls Morris for a couple of runs to bring up the Pakistan hundred. 40 more needed from 28 overs. Is there a sting in the ale/tale? Something in your eye, cobbah? 21st over: Pakistan 97-2 (Babar 7, Rizwan 4) Babar and Rizwan exchange singles as Pakistan inch closer. Just enjoyed this with my morning coffee in foggy London town, Ali Martin in fine fettle: 20th over: Pakistan 94-2 (Babar 6, Rizwan 3) Five off the over as Babar and Rizwan calm things down after the double wicket whammy. 19th over: Pakistan 89-2 (Babar 5, Rizwan 0) Babar plays one of those gawwwgeous cover drives for four off Johnson. 18th over: Pakistan 85-2 (Babar 1, Rizwan 0) The experienced hands of Babar and Rizwan arrive at the crease. 56 needed for a famous win, Pakistan can\u2019t mess this up, Shirley? Two wickets in the over for Morris and both openers in his back pocket. Saim goes back and chops a back of a length ball onto his stumps. Is this the start of something? A sharp grab in his follow through by Morris sees the end of Shafique! He\u2019s laid a firm foundation for his side but has to depart shy of a half century. 17th over: Pakistan 84-0 (Saim 40, Abdullah 35) Zampa shuffles in and bowls flat at the pads and stumps. Clipped for four singles. Just 57 more needed for Pakistan. 16th over: Pakistan 80-0 (Saim 40, Abdullah 35) Wicket me, Hardie\u2026 Change of bowling as Aaron Hardie come into the attack but he can\u2019t get the breakthrough that Australia desperately need. Adam Zampa is being summoned, can he atone for that dropped catch? 15th over: Pakistan 75-0 (Saim 39, Abdullah 31) Singles collected without drama off Morris. Pakistan closing in on a momentous victory. Don\u2019t just take my word for it. 14th over: Pakistan 71-0 (Saim 38, Abdullah 29) Saim opens his shoulders! Flaying Abbot away for four through point. A single to midwicket brings Shafique on strike. Four more! Pulled into the leg side with panache. DROP! Adam Zampa what have you done! A simple chance in the grand scheme, skier at fine leg goes in and plops out. Australia are well off the pace in Perth. 13th over: Pakistan 61-0 (Saim 33, Abdullah 24) Here\u2019s Lance Morris. Can he prise a wicket for Australia? Nope. Abdullah clips for a couple. Pakistan need 80 more runs to win the series. 12th over: Pakistan 59-0 (Saim 33, Abdullah 22) A tale of two pull shots from Saim Ayub, his first off Abbott nearly brings about his demise but the ball lands safely between converging fielders and the next is timed away for four off the middle. 11th over: Pakistan 51-0 (Saim 26, Abdullah 21) Shafique drives Johnson down the ground handsomely and the openers scamper three runs to chalk up the fifty partnership. It\u2019s not been that pretty but Saim and Abdullah are getting the job done for their side. 10th over: Pakistan 47-0 (Saim 25, Abdullah 18) It\u2019s all happening in Perth! Sean Abbot over steps and is called for a no ball. Free hit incoming\u2026 SIX! Saim hoicks away into the leg side and Spencer Johsnon makes a hash of the catch on the sponge, parrying it over for six big ones. Abbot does not look happy but only has himself and his big size 11s to blame. 9th over: Pakistan 38-0 (Saim 17, Abdullah 18) Saim Ayub tries a hook this time and there\u2019s a strangled appeal as he misses out but was there a tickle? Replays show a flat line, there was nothing on it as it passed through to Inglis behind the stumps. DROP! Lance Morris spills a tough chance at deep third as Saim cuts away uppishly, the fielder got a couple of mitts to it but couldn\u2019t cling on. Australia can\u2019t afford to let chances like that go begging. 8th over: Pakistan 37-0 (Saim 16, Abdullah 18) Sean Abbott replaces Stoinis and is hit for ten runs off his first over! Abdullah Shafique showing some good intent by dancing down and driving for a couple and then rocking back to book a short ball that soars away for SIX over the keeper\u2019s head. Australia need wickets, like they didn\u2019t before. 7th over: Pakistan 27-0 (Saim 15, Abdullah 9) Johnson sends down five dots before spearing in a very short ball that flies of Saim\u2019s head and is called a wide. He\u2019ll have to bowl an extra ball\u2026 and it costs him! Saim somehow clips off the inner half of his bat over the fielder at square leg and the ball rolls away for four. Streaky but Pakistan won\u2019t mind at all. 6th over: Pakistan 22-0 (Saim 11, Abdullah 9) Stoinis joins the dots and stitches together a maiden. Run rate isn\u2019t a problem for the visitors, they can afford the off frugal over. It\u2019s all about wickets from here. 5th over: Pakistan 22-0 (Saim 11, Abdullah 9) Johnson loses his radar at the start of the fifth over, whangin\u2019 consecutive balls down the leg side for wides. Scrappy doo. Shafique drives for a brace down the ground but then has a complete brain fade and is almost run out! A clip to Stoinis at mid off and the single wasn\u2019t really on, a mid pitch dance and Shafique was gone if the big fella had hit the stumps with the throw. Settle down, settle down. 4th over: Pakistan 17-0 (Saim 11, Abdullah 6) Saim lofts over the ring at midwicket and desrved four, the ball plugging on the unusually slow Perth outfield. Three runs added. Stoinis is worked for singles, all a bit too easy for Pakistan. Time for some pace in the shape of Lance Morris, perhaps? 3rd over: Pakistan 11-0 (Saim 7, Abdullah 4) Johnson nearly pockets Saim Ayub with a beauty that shapes away late, leaving the batter groping at fresh air with the blade. Singles the order of the over, four taken from the over as Pakistan\u2019s openers lay a foundation and chip away. 2nd over: Pakistan 7-0 (Saim 5, Abdullah 2) Marcus Stoinis bustles in for the second over. Torso like an American fridge. Shafique picks up a single down the ground and Saim Ayub clips a poor ball off his hips for an easy four to end the over. The sounds of A-Ha blast through the stadium PA system. Thanks Martin and hello all. A rousing Pakistan series victory on Australian soil coming from behind you say? I don\u2019t mind it, but will it be straightforward? Don\u2019t count on it. 1st over: Pakistan 2-0 (Saim 1, Abdullah 1) A promising start from Spencer Johnson as the left-armer has the ball angling back into the Pakistan openers. Saim Ayub swipes at a wider ball and is fortunate to have missed completely. Abdullah Shafique then fails to punish the one loose ball of the over, as he picks out fine leg for a single. Australia are into a huddle with captain Josh Inglis trying to fire up the troops in his national captaincy debut. The young squad has some weapons, with Lance Morris able to shake up any top order, left-armer Spencer Johnson just as quick, and Sean Abbott one of the craftier cricketers going around. The white-ball spin wizard Adam Zampa will test the Pakistan middle order if given the opportunity though we\u2019re yet to see how this pitch will spin. Spencer Johnson takes the new ball and will bowl around the wicket and I\u2019ll now hand you over to James Wallace to steer you through the second dig. While we wait for the second innings to start just a cheeky reminder that Australia have named their squad to face India in the five-Test Border-Gavaskar Trophy series. The hosts could probably have done with that entire squad showing up in Perth for this ODI series decider against Pakistan, but we instead have Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne sitting out this third match after being part of games one and two. Travis Head and Mitch Marsh have skipped all of this series while on paternity leave. Australia have set a new, unwanted record for their lowest ODI total against Pakistan with 140-9 on the board, just two days after laying down the previous marker, as Shaheen takes out Lance Morris\u2019s off-stump. You couldn\u2019t expect the No 11 to do too much with that one. There is plenty of bounce and movement out of the pitch but it would be unfair to take anything away from the Pakistan pace attack that frankly outclassed Australia\u2019s undermanned batting lineup. All four of the Pakistan quicks ran riot with Shaheen Shah Afridi (3-32) surviving an injury scare late in the innings, while Haris Rauf (2-24) again shook up the Australians and dismissed his newfound bunny Glenn Maxwell for the third time in the series. Naseem Shah (3-54) and Mohammad Hasnain (1-24) also played their part as Pakistan did not even have to call on a part-timer as their fifth bowler, a punt that has paid off handsomely in two matches now. Sean Abbott (30) top scored for Australia as the all-rounder tried to set up a defendable total, after Matt Short (22) put together a more mature knock than we\u2019re used to from him even as wickets fell with worrying regularity. Cooper Connolly was forced to retire hurt after copping a heavy blow to the hand and while any of his additional runs would be useful right now there is little to suggest this is a wicket worthy of such a meagre score. Abbott looks to get on the attack but is through his shot too early and pops a slower ball from Shaheen straight to Rauf at mid-on. Rauf isn\u2019t going to spill that with the form he is in whenever he\u2019s near the ball. With Connolly out of action after taking a blow to his hand while batting, Australia are down to their last stand. 31st over: Australia 140-7 (Abbott 30, Johnson 12) SIX! Abbott looks to take matters into his own hands as he refuses an easy single off the first delivery of the over then two balls later bangs the first six of the innings. Abbott backs away and smacks the short high over midwicket, just long enough to fall out of reach of Abdullah Shafique on the boundary. 30th over: Australia 133-7 (Abbott 23, Johnson 12) Rauf has dominated this series with some fiery bowling but Johnson shows him little respect with a pair of sensational boundaries. The first comes from Johnson using the angle of the ball to deflect it through gully, the next is smacked in front of the wicket. Rauf responds with a shorter, quicker ball that Johnson does well to keep down perhaps with more glove than bat. 29th over: Australia 125-7 (Abbott 23, Johnson 4) Johnson punches Naseem through point for three runs then Abbott clips him over mid-on for a couple more. The all-rounder becomes Australia\u2019s top scorer in the innings and has looked the most comfortable too. 28th over: Australia 120-7 (Abbott 21, Johnson 1) Haris Rauf is back and Australia might be looking to simply survive for as many balls as possible. Abbott immediately shows faith in his new partner as he scampers through for a risky single. A direct hit would have had Johnson heading back to the pavilion but the fielder holds onto the ball with no one backing up the throw to the keeper\u2019s end. 27th over: Australia 118-7 (Abbott 20, Johnson 0) Abbott punishes a loose delivery from Naseem then survives a cracker that was angling away from the right-hander before jagging back into him off the seam. Zampa gives himself room to cut but doesn\u2019t go hard enough as the ball flies straight to Saim Ayub at gully. Zampa was showing positive signs but a limp cut shot goes straight to Saim Ayub in the gully. It was a strange shot after the Australian had been looking to attack more but ends up with a very soft dismissal. 26th over: Australia 113-6 (Abbott 15, Zampa 13) Shaheen sends a scare through the Pakistan camp as he claims a throw in but then is cramped down on the ground with concern over his critical left hand. The fast bowler\u2019s thumb looks to have popped out and Babar steps in to put it back into place. Drinks are taken while Pakistan sort it out with a healthy dose of the \u201cmagic spray\u201d. Shaheen returns to bowl out the remaining three balls in the over, digs in a bouncer of the last delivery that is called a wide. Zampa swings wildly at the follow up but his head is up and he misses by a fair margin. 25th over: Australia 111-6 (Abbott 14, Zampa 13) The experience duo keep the score ticking over with easy singles. Now is not the time for any further risk with half the overs still in hand and Pakistan yet to turn to their fifth bowler. 24th over: Australia 107-6 (Abbott 12, Zampa 11) Sean Abbott shows his top order how it\u2019s done as be hoicks a pull shot through midwicket for a powerful boundary along the grass. That\u2019s the best shot we\u2019ve seen from an Australian for quite some time. Shaheen pitches it up for the rest of the over but Abbott has it under control. 23rd over: Australia 101-6 (Abbott 7, Zampa 10) Australia bring up the 100 as they look to set a defendable target. 150 might be enough on this bouncy deck. Zampa slashes hard at a wide ball and immediately spins around as it takes an edge but is fortunate enough to see it sail high over slip for four. 22nd over: Australia 94-6 (Abbott 6, Zampa 5) Shaheen comes back into the attack as Pakistan look to finish off Australia. Abbott pulls a loosener away for a single but Zampa is on the attack to find three runs over cover. 21st over: Australia 90-6 (Abbott 5, Zampa 2) Hasnain gets the better of Stoinis and Pakistan are into Australia\u2019s tail well before the halfway mark of the innings. Australia\u2019s score of 163 \u2013 their lowest ever in ODIs between these two teams \u2013 seems a long way off. Stoinis tries to play over a ball travelling just outside off but is cramped up after it finds the seam. An edge takes it through to Rizwan for yet another catch and Hasnain has his first of the day. The young pacer has been playing his part superbly and deserved to get it on the action. 20th over: Australia 87-5 (Stoinis 8, Abbott 4) Stoinis has his head down and sees off a tamer over from Rauf. It\u2019s a maiden. 19th over: Australia 87-5 (Stoinis 8, Abbott 4) Hasnain keeps the foot on the throttle with another tidy over. Abbott picks up a couple on the with a neat prod through the offside. Word out of the Australia camp is that Cooper Connolly has been taken for scans on his left hand after being struck while batting. At this stage it is possible Connolly won\u2019t return to the crease or field in the second innings. 18th over: Australia 81-5 (Stoinis 6, Abbott 1) Rauf has his bunny and Pakistan are in dreamland with Australia effectively six down inside 20 overs. Sean Abbott is no slouch with the bat, and has a couple of half-centuries in his 25 ODIs, and Australia really need this partnership to carry through to the fifth bowler in search of a defendable total. Haris Rauf once again picks up the key wicket of Glenn Maxwell as Australia are on the brink of collapse. Maxwell looks to guide a short ball away but a leading edge pops it straight to Saim Ayub at point. Rauf now has Maxwell three times from the nine balls he has bowled to the Australian dangerman in the series. 17th over: Australia 79-4 (Stoinis 5, Maxwell 0) RETIRED HURT! Things go from bad to worse for Australia as Cooper Connolly is struck on the left hand while trying to pull Hasnain and is forced from the field. That looked to hit him flush on the knuckle, the batter takes time to remove the gloves but is clearly in pain and can\u2019t carry on as he retires hurt on seven. That brings an out-of-sorts Glenn Maxwell to the crease and he needs runs as much as his team do right now. 16th over: Australia 78-4 (Connolly 6, Stoinis 5) Stoinis is living on the edge as he dabs a bat out at a wider ball from Rauf that fortunately for Australia is quite far away from the edge. Not sure the all-rounder knew much about that one. Stoinis looks more in control later in the over as he slices a cut shot over a fielder at point and it takes two bounces to the boundary. Rauf responds with a quicker ball that beats Stoinis for pace. 15th over: Australia 74-4 (Connolly 6, Stoinis 1) Connolly flicks a single away and Hasnain goes to work on Stoinis. The Australian all-rounder is in no hurry with his side already four down as he leaves the wider balls sail by and defends stoutly when needed. 14th over: Australia 72-4 (Connolly 6, Stoinis 0) Short and Connolly look as comfortable against Rauf as any Australians have in this series as they each pick up three runs. That\u2019s at least until the opener directs a pull shot straight to Irfan Khan in the deep. Rauf pitched that one a bit closer to Short but he still looked to have it under control, other than mis-directing the pull shot. Rauf has his ninth scalp for the series, and that\u2019s drinks! Short has started picking up runs with controlled pull shots but smacks a shorter ball from Haris Rauf straight to Irfan Khan at deep square leg. It\u2019s like catching practice for the Pakistan fielder as he cups the catch with ease. The opener was showing signs of building a mature innings into a big score but is on his way as Rauf again dismantles the hosts. 13th over: Australia 65-3 (Short 19, Connolly 2) Naseem loses his line and perhaps needs a break after bowling three wides in the over. Short pulls one away neatly for to square leg for a couple and is building steadily even while others fall around him. 12th over: Australia 59-3 (Short 17, Connolly 1) Pakistan dangerman Haris Rauf comes into the attack with Australia on the ropes. Rauf already has eight wickets in the series but makes little headway with his first over as Connolly and Short each pick up a single without too much trouble. 11th over: Australia 57-3 (Short 17, Connolly 1) Pakistan swing Naseem to the opposite end for an extra over and the gamble pays off as the pacer picks up the key scalp of the in-form Inglis. That one came from nowhere as the batting pair were playing cautiously, trying to rebuild the innings. The Australian captain couldn\u2019t help but swing at a shorter ball passing just outside off and the steady stream of wickets keeps flowing. Cooper Connolly gets the call up early, as Australia look to save their powerhitters Stoinis and Maxwell for later. Josh Inglis gets on the back foot as Naseem digs one in short of a length but Australia\u2019s skipper can\u2019t keep the pull shot down and a top edge sails skyward. Rizwan barely has to move as it drops into his gloves and Pakistan are back on top. 10th over: Australia 54-2 (Short 16, Inglis 7) Mohammad Hasnain comes into the attack and the subtle drop in pace takes the pressure off the Australians. Short twice tries to pull, mis-timing the first and completely missing the second as it crashes off his helmet and towards the boundary for four leg byes. 9th over: Australia 48-2 (Short 15, Inglis 7) Another sensational over from Shaheen but this time it goes without reward. Short turns over the strike with a mis-timed pull for a single, then Inglis passes the test as he chooses wisely when to leave or play the ball. Shaheen still beats him with back-to-back beauties angling across the right-hander. That was a joy to watch! 8th over: Australia 47-2 (Short 14, Inglis 7) Inglis gets going with a powerful straight drive through mid-on for four, then flicks off his pads but can only get an inside edge for a couple more. Naseem fights back with some deliveries back of a length but Australia\u2019s captain is taking no risks for now. 7th over: Australia 41-2 (Short 14, Inglis 1) Australia have the run rate ticking over nicely but once again are the victims of some clever bowling from Pakistan\u2019s quicks. Shaheen worked on Hardie across a couple of overs and deserved an early scalp, though there is plenty in this pitch for the pacers. Inglis comes to the crease with his side needing a captain\u2019s knock (no pressure, skip), finds a single and Short finishes the over with a punishing drive for four. Shaheen has been shaping the ball back into Hardie but gets this one to move away off the seam. Hardie picks up the movement late, thinks about shouldering arms but a deflection while trying to keep his bat out of the way nicks off to first slip. 6th over: Australia 36-1 (Short 10, Hardie 12) The most prosperous over for Australia so far as Short punches away a shorter ball for three past point, then Hardie follows up with back-to-back boundaries. Naseem is getting the ball to swing away from the right-hander, but Hardie works it nicely for valuable runs. 5th over: Australia 22-1 (Short 7, Hardie 1) A superb over from Shaheen but Hardie somehow holds out the Pakistan quick. The biggest shout was for lbw as Shaheen brings the fourth ball back into the right-hander and it brushes past his pads. Pakistan ponder a review but Rizwan is a split second too slow and his belated request is waved away \u2013 fortunately for the tourists as replays show the ball was clearing middle and leg. It feels like even the little things are going Pakistan\u2019s way at the moment. Maiden over! 4th over: Australia 22-1 (Short 7, Hardie 1) Australia\u2019s opening pair once again fail to make the most of a decent start with Naseem sending Fraser-McGurk back to the sheds. The young gun was looking to drive on the up with his head and feet stationary he could only find an edge. Naseem has a spring in his step and tests Aaron Hardie from the get go. The Pakistan pacer has quickly settled into the bouncy Optus Stadium pitch. Naseem gets the breakthrough as Fraser-McGurk plays too far away from his body and gets a thick edge. There was hardy any foot movement from the young Australian and he falls cheaply for the third time in the series. 3rd over: Australia 20-0 (Short 7, Fraser-McGurk 7) Left-armer Shaheen is bowling around the wicket and has the ball shaping away nicely from Short. The opener pushes a straighter, fuller delivery to mid-off for a couple. A neat over but Australia\u2019s opening pair survive past the third over for the first time in the series. 2nd over: Australia 18-0 (Short 5, Fraser-McGurk 7) Naseem Shah almost gets a breakthrough from just his second delivery as Fraser-McGurk edges between second and third slip. That one reared up at the Australian opener and he was fortunate the nick was as thick as it was, but will gladly pocket the four runs as well. JFM works a couple off his pads then survives a half-hearted appeal for run out to round out the over. 1st over: Australia 12-0 (Short 5, Fraser-McGurk 1) A loose first over from Shaheen Shah Afridi allows the Australian pair to get on the front foot as Matt Short and Jake Fraser-McGurk each get off the mark with a quick single. A wild delivery sails between first and second slip all the way to the boundary for five wides, Shah sends another wide heading to first slip, and Short finishes the over with four all-run off a sublime drive. Just the start Australia needed. The national anthems are sung, the Australian openers are at the crease, and Shaheen Shah Afridi is steaming in with ball in hand. Game on! As confirmed earlier, Australia have shaken up their XI with Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne sitting this one out. Josh Inglis will lead a national side for the first time and do so in front of his home crowd. Pakistan are unchanged and why would they mix things up with the series on the line after a dominant display with bat and ball in the second ODI on Friday night. Australia XI: Matt Short, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Aaron Hardie, Josh Inglis (c, wk), Cooper Connolly, Marcus Stoinis, Glenn Maxwell, Sean Abbott, Adam Zampa, Spencer Johnson, Lance Morris Pakistan XI: Abdullah Shafique, Saim Ayub, Babar Azam, Muhammad Rizwan (c, wk), Kamran Ghulam, Salman Ali Agha, Mohammad Irfan Khan, Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, Haris Rauf, Mohammad Hasnain Mohammad Rizwan wins the coin flip after some debate over whether he called heads or tails and, just as he did on Friday, sends Australia in to bat first at Optus Stadium in Perth. Josh Inglis is captaining Australia for the first time and says his side \u201cprobably would\u2019ve bowled first as well\u201d. Could have been a little more decisive there. Back to the white-ball game but in a distant land, England have bounced back from their ODI series defeat to West Indies to win the opening T20I in the Caribbean. A Phil Salt onslaught sealed the deal on what was once his home ground: With one eye already on the blockbuster Test series against India that starts in Perth on 22 November, Australia have named their first squad. Nathan McSweeney has won the Great Australian bat off and will open alongside Usman Khawaja while there is a curious choice for back up batter. Full squad here: Hello and welcome to the third and final ODI between Australia and Pakistan at Optus Stadium in Perth. The one-day international series comes down to this after Pakistan stunned Australia with a resounding nine-wicket victory at Adelaide Oval on Friday. The tourists could now break a 22-year drought as well as lay down a marker ahead of a Champions Trophy tournament in Pakistan (at least at this stage). Pakistan skittled Australia for their lowest total in 50-over matches between the teams, then chased down the target of 164 with ease to seal their first win over Australia in the format since 2017. On the other hand, it was Australia\u2019s first nine-wicket defeat on home soil since 1992. The tourists now have a gilt-edged opportunity to triumph in an ODI series in Australia for the first time since 2002 as the hosts take an undermanned XI into the decider. Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne will all sit out this ODI and have not even made the trip to Perth as they start to prepare for the five-Test Border Gavaskar Trophy series against India. Priorities, hey! Can the next generation take command of the Australia side and claim a stirring series victory? I guess we\u2019re about to find out. I\u2019ll be with you until the innings break when James Wallace will take the reins. First ball is at 11.30am AWST / 2.30pm AEDT. I\u2019ll be back shortly with the line-ups and toss news. Remember to get in touch with any comments, questions, thoughts and predictions. You can find me on X @martinpegan or shoot me an email. Let\u2019s get into it!",

It\u2019s a testament to your awareness, your capacity to break cycles, and your desire to give her what you perhaps longed for yourself. But it also sounds like you\u2019ve inherited some emotional armour, a kind of self-protective barrier that makes it hard to connect with others, particularly in those moments of casual human interaction that seem so effortless to some.</p> <p>I understand what you\u2019re saying about standing at the school gates, watching the other parents engage so easily in the kind of small talk and camaraderie that elude you. It\u2019s easy to feel, in those moments, like something about you is <em>off</em>, that you are on the outside looking in. But what you describe, this feeling of awkwardness, of being slow to warm to people, too cold, too closed off, is a deeply human one. Many of us are convinced our insecurities are somehow screaming out to the world, because we compare what we feel like on the inside to what other people look like to us on the outside. But in reality, you won\u2019t be the only one feeling awkward. I doubt you are cold or unapproachable. I believe you are someone who has learned to guard themselves. Maybe there\u2019s a part of you that believes that if you take down those defences, you\u2019ll expose yourself to judgment, to vulnerability, or to rejection. But the path forward, I think, is to allow yourself to lean into those vulnerabilities and embrace the very thing that feels uncomfortable.</p> <p>Start small. Don\u2019t overthink the interactions at the school gates. Don\u2019t focus on what you feel you lack or how you come across, instead focus on the other person. Listen to them. Ask them how they are. The intention behind small talk matters more than the words themselves. And if your makeup feels like armour, consider that maybe it isn\u2019t your face that\u2019s off-putting, but the self-consciousness that\u2019s hiding beneath it. When you make yourself interested in the other rather than worrying how you come across, the self-consciousness decreases. People are drawn to openness, to warmth and I believe you possess those things.</p> <p>Your daughter\u2019s struggles may reflect some of your own, but this doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re failing her. You\u2019re aware of it and that awareness is more powerful than you realise. She\u2019s learning from you, but she\u2019s also her own person, navigating her own emotional terrain. What matters most is that she feels loved by you and that love will find its way through the smallest cracks, despite any emotional restrictions you might feel.</p> <p>The walls you\u2019ve inherited don\u2019t define you, nor do they need to stand forever. Even if you never find yourself hugging strangers at the school gates, it doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t capable of deep connection.

      "body": "<p>In 1968, three people decided to cure infertility. In the 10 years between 1968 and 1978, Robert (Bob) Edwards, a scientist, Patrick Steptoe, an obstetrician, Jean Purdy, an embryologist, worked together, with many others, to do something incredible. Basing themselves in an outbuilding at Oldham general on scraps of money, with nurses volunteering their time, and patients their patience, they worked incessantly on the issue of infertility.</p> \n<p>Bob had had a number of breakthroughs working with mice and rabbits, and thought that with Patrick\u2019s innovations with laparoscopes (keyhole surgery), there was a possibility that tubal infertility could be, at least partially,&nbsp;cured.</p> \n<p>They faced a mass of opposition, societal and medical. They argued that infertility was a disease as deserving of attention and cure as any other. They were told that they were playing God, that they risked creating Frankenstein babies, that society was overpopulated as it was. The British medical establishment \u2013 rather than rewarding their progress \u2013 set out to destroy and decry their achievement. They fought on, despite everything, and managed to do something truly great: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/jul/11/medicineandhealth.lifeandhealth\">Louise Joy Brown</a> was born on the 25 July 1978. There are now 12 million more children on the planet because of them. Born to people who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have been able to have&nbsp;them.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The word \u2018survivor\u2019 is a grand word that\u2019s often misappropriated but going through IVF was the hardest thing we\u2019d ever done</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>It is, without doubt, one of the great medical breakthroughs of the 20th century. It is an amazing British story, one which I don\u2019t think many people&nbsp;know. And it\u2019s the reason why my partner and I have a child.</p> \n<p>It took Rachel [a comedy agent] and me seven rounds of IVF to have Elliott. What started as a journey where we told everyone, and almost celebrated doing it, became a brutal and dark time. Two years after we had him, Rach told me she\u2019d been ready to leave me had IVF not worked for us. She wanted me to have a child and decided I wanted and needed children more than I wanted and needed her. This wasn\u2019t true. But it was what she was thinking.</p> \n<p>I\u2019m going to quote her exactly here: \u201cI felt that it wasn\u2019t fair as the issue was mine. I was so desperate to have a child, I imagined you must have felt the same pain. It took over my life in so many ways, and everywhere I looked I couldn\u2019t escape it; pregnancies being announced, babies being born. I\u2019m glad Instagram reveals weren\u2019t a thing then. Or at least I wasn\u2019t aware of them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Now, ask anyone who knows us, and they\u2019ll say I\u2019m the lucky one of the partnership. In fact, you only need meet us for five minutes and you know it. My own dad, on the day before our wedding, told me: \u201cIf you mess this up, I will probably never forgive you.\u201d I never wanted children before I met her, she knew how much I loved her, but she couldn\u2019t get this thing out of her head \u2013 failing IVF was failing me.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/14/joy-bill-nighy-james-norton-thomasin-mckenzie-film-ivf-playing-god\">\u2018More important than going to the moon\u2019: Bill Nighy, James Norton and Thomasin McKenzie on their film about the birth of IVF</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>We both feel ashamed of that time, me with more reason. The fact that I didn\u2019t see her pain, the fact that I didn\u2019t reassure her, the fact that \u2013 as with a lot of things \u2013 I was very goal oriented (I used to quote fertility statistics at her after every failure: \u201cthe next round our percentage goes up 2.3%\u201d, etc). I let her down and left her in a very lonely place. I say all this because, I think, it is illustrative of the damage infertility can do.</p> \n<p>A damage that I hope fills every part of the film we wrote together,&nbsp;<em>Joy</em>.</p> \n<p>And the love and the joy we\u2019ve had from Elliott I hope fills it too.</p> \n<p>It all started with an email from my friends Finola Dwyer and Amanda Posey. They\u2019re a brilliant producing pair, makers of such incredible films as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/01/an-education-review\">An Education</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/08/brooklyn-observer-film-review-saoirse-ronan#:~:text=Like%20its%20heroine%2C%20Brooklyn%20does,its%20deceptively%20low%2Dkey%20charm.\">Brooklyn</a></em>. They knew about Rachel and I\u2019s fertility journey, in fact Amanda had been on a similar journey herself with her own IVF child. They told me that Path\u00e9 was looking to make a film about IVF.</p> \n<p>It was a subject I knew a little bit about because of Elliott. In fact, I\u2019d pitched a play about it to the Manchester Royal Exchange, but I pitched badly \u2013 mainly talking about Edwards\u2019s mice \u2013 and they turned me down. Cameron McCracken<em>, </em>who ran the film division at Pathe<em>, </em>had a new way in. Telling a story around the character of Jean Purdy, the nurse and embryologist who worked with Bob and Patrick and a woman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/10/jean-purdy-female-nurse-who-played-crucial-role-in-ivf-ignored-on-plaque\">ignored in many people\u2019s celebration of IVF</a>. I showed the idea to Rachel, and she said, \u201cYou have to do it.\u201d After sleeping on it for the night, I suggested at breakfast the next day \u2013 \u201cWhy don\u2019t we do it together?\u201d</p> \n<p>It took her a beat before she reluctantly agreed.</p> \n<p>This wasn\u2019t something I did lightly and it wasn\u2019t something she agreed to lightly. I have a slightly manic relationship with writing, of which she was well aware. She\u2019d seen and understood a lot of me, but we\u2019ve never been the sort of couple who wanted to share everything. I am autistic and temperamentally a loner. Writing is my safety net and governs a lot of my relationship with the world (are you seeing now how I am the lucky one?). When I am at my worst, Rachel will literally send me away to write. Sharing this with her, and she with me, meant her seeing the final part of my brain, my hidden bit. She was as nervous of this as I was.</p> \n<p>But I couldn\u2019t imagine doing it without her. Partly because Rachel has far more understanding of infertility than I do. After our experience, she\u2019d made it her duty to do more for people going through it, volunteering for the Fertility Network and running a monthly support group. But mainly because writing is an empathy leap that relies on biography. Even when writing a furious fallen angel, there are pieces of your past you put together to build that fallen angel. In this case, I didn\u2019t want to pick apart that piece of me without her picking it apart with me. The word \u201csurvivor\u201d is a grand word that\u2019s often misappropriated, and maybe it would be misappropriated here, but going through IVF was the hardest thing we\u2019d ever done, and I wanted to work on this with her.</p> \n<p>And thankfully, she wanted to work with me.</p> \n<p>Now this was bang in the middle of Covid, so we immediately started excavating, albeit from our locked-down home. Diving into archives. Reading everything we could. Watching everything we could. And talking to everyone we could. We\u2019d spend the lockdown day with Elliott, I did home school in the morning (as I mentioned, I\u2019m very goal oriented/the boring parent), she did play in the afternoon. Then in the evening we would sit and Skype or Zoom with someone from this history. Jenny Joy, Edwards\u2019s daughter, helped us talk to everyone involved. Because of her generosity and the generosity of so many people, we were able to talk to a number of key sources who helped us uncover this extraordinary story.</p> \n<p>Patrick and Bob wrote a beautiful book \u2013 that was our base, everything else we tried to build on top of that. We\u2019d find out shards of information and slowly that jigsaw puzzle of 1968-78 came puzzlingly into the&nbsp;light.</p> \n<p>Andrew Steptoe, Patrick\u2019s son, told us extraordinary stories about his father\u2019s life in the second world war, of him having to make extraordinary decisions on a rescue raft. We got insight into his family life, and love of music. But the bit we found most moving was that Patrick was one of three obstetric consultants at Oldham, but the only one who\u2019d perform newly legalised terminations, so he did them all. We never wanted this to be a film about women wanting babies, we wanted this to be a film about people having the choice whether or not to have babies. Suddenly, in Patrick, we had the ability to play this through the choices he made.</p> \n<p>We read as much as we could about Muriel Harris, with whom Patrick worked. Arguably the second woman excluded. An incredible operating theatre superintendent who found ways of making a largely volunteer rota work. Our favourite Muriel fact? That when she finally retired from Bourn Hall, the fertility unit they\u2019d set up together, she decided to get her pilot\u2019s licence. She succeeded in her 70s. I cannot tell you how many times we wrote that into the post-credits sequence at the end of the film. I am gutted it had to be cut.</p> \n<p>Bob\u2019s effervescence was legendary. Everyone we talked to talked about ideas and thoughts tumbling out of him. An hour in his company would be overwhelmingly full of exhausting thought. He never stopped making and thinking and doing. He even runs for parliament halfway through the film, an act which needs far more time than we can give it. His relationship with Ruth, his wife, and his children, was full of discussion and chaos. A true genius, whose pathway to genius was a really complicated road. You could make an entire eight-part TV series about Bob, and only capture half of him.</p> \n<p>And then there was Jean. The most private of all of them. We knew we wanted her to be central, but her centrality was dependent on knowing enough to build her out.</p> \n<p>The tragic part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jun/16/the-five-unsung-female-scientists-overlook-credit-stolen-jean-purdy\">Jean</a>\u2019s story is that she was the first of the IVF group to die. She passed at the age of 39 from a malignant melanoma. Her final days were spent in a specially prepared room in Bourn Hall. She died in a place she made, and a place she loved.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qoyn5BCm37o\"> <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Qoyn5BCm37o?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qoyn5BCm37o\">Watch a trailer for Joy.</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>She was instinctively someone more comfortable in the background, and she left very little record of her life.</p> \n<p>We kept on trying to find her brother, but discovered he\u2019d died. We were desperate to get hold of her notebooks, but they couldn\u2019t be found. Rachel got in contact with the Churchill Archives Centre, which holds Bob\u2019s notebooks, articles, letters and lectures, and we started to piece her together.</p> \n<p>We questioned everyone about her, and discovered increasingly large slivers of information. About who she was and how she lived. Rach and I liked the way Louise Brown described her as \u201cmy first babysitter\u201d. In the lab, she was the first person to witness the cell division of the embryo that would become Louise. But our most moving conversation, and the one that shed most light on Jean, was with the remarkable Grace MacDonald. In 1979 Grace gave birth to the second IVF baby, Alastair. Grace gave us insight into the women at the heart of the programme, she even told us the name they gave themselves \u2013 \u201cthe ovum club\u201d. She gave us a new angle on Jean. It was Jean who truly ran the ovum club, looking after all these mothers-to-be. It was Jean that made them central.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>All three would be appalled that despite progress made in IVF, other working-class parents aren\u2019t given the opportunity now</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>This film is not without its challenges. On the upside, these people have a clear aim, they know what they\u2019re doing, and by the end \u2013 they do it. Unfortunately, it takes them 10 years and much of the time they\u2019re on a road between Oldham and Cambridge. Progress, as with lots of science, comes in jumps and starts. If you marked off each year (we did) between 1968 and 1978, you\u2019d see huge amounts being achieved during certain years, and more or less nothing in others. It doesn\u2019t have the peanut-butter-smooth feeling that you might concoct if writing this without the facts.</p> \n<p>Thankfully, it was a film surrounded by fertility love. Not just us, and Amanda, for Ben Taylor, the brilliant director of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jan/20/catastrophe-review-sharon-horgan-rob-delaney-channel-4#:~:text=Really%20good%2C%20sharp%20writing%20and,she%20was%20brilliant%20in%20Extra's.\">Catastrophe</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/sep/24/sex-education-final-season-review-chris-packham-is-it-time-to-break-the-law-picasso-the-beauty-and-the-beast-juice\">Sex Education</a></em>, who got involved.

I hope it doesn\u2019t exclusively fit that archetype, but the engine is a sports one. This is a film where the final achievement is known, this is a film where the impossible is made possible, this is a film where no one bloody helps them. They do it despite the odds. It\u2019s a miracle film. And sports films love a miracle.</p> \n<p>But it\u2019s a sports film where the stakes are gargantuan. It is a sports film which is literally about the essence of life, and the pain of being denied that life. My favourite scene in the film is one on a cold beach. Jean is talking to Trisha, one of the ovum club, and tells her that she\u2019s jealous of Rachel, who has just achieved the first pregnancy. The words are nothing special, but the actors Thomasin McKenzie and Charlie Murphy, who play Jean and Trisha respectively, imbue it with such truth and simple beauty, and somehow it sums up the cruelty of fertility for me.</p> \n<p>I think fertility is something we need to talk about. Uneasy though it seems to make everyone. Obviously, what\u2019s happening in America makes IVF a particular issue right now. Doctors being frightened to help patients because their intervention may be deemed an act of abortion. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jul/29/abortion-laws-bans-by-state#:~:text=Since%20Roe%20was%20overturned%20in,referendums%20to%20protect%20abortion%20rights.\">Reproductive rights</a> are being truly threatened. But I also think how we feel and talk about IVF in this country needs thinking about too.</p> \n<p>IVF is now something you largely seem to pay for. Deemed a luxury good. It\u2019s become a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/jan/22/longing-for-a-baby-the-ivf-postcode-lottery-can-have-a-high-price\">postcode lottery</a> that favours those that go private. Louise Brown\u2019s parents were working class: Lesley had a variety of jobs including working in a laundry, John was a lorry driver for British Rail. These were people who, when they first met, had been forced to sleep rough for a while. They were given the opportunity to have Louise through the bloody-minded perseverance of Bob, Patrick and Jean, and I think all three would be appalled that despite the progress made in IVF, other working-class parents are not given the opportunity now.</p> \n<p>Bob, on his many appearances on TV and the radio, would always say that infertility is a medical problem like any other. My experience, and the experience of many of my friends, is that infertility is also something that can do enormous damage. In no way am I saying that everyone wants babies. But some do. I know we live in a time when the NHS is cracking at the seams. But the rationing of fertility care does not make sense to me. People need to have a choice about whether they have children or not. A choice that, if we truly still have national healthcare provision, should not be imposed wholly by the government. Rationing of care is rationing of care, and I don\u2019t think fertility treatment should be&nbsp;rationed.</p> \n<p>I think being an IVF parent is a privilege. Being any parent is a privilege, of course. But there\u2019s something about struggling \u2013 really struggling to have a child \u2013 that changes your relationship with 2am wake-ups. The thing that unites all IVF parents is that we saw our kids when they were a dot on a screen or on a printout. Others get to see their babies when they\u2019re orange sized or bigger; I saw Elliott as literally a speck. I wouldn\u2019t change the way we made him and I am so grateful to Bob, Jean and Patrick that we were able to make him because of their chaotic, brilliant, ceaseless endeavour.</p> \n<p>Hopefully, this film reminds everyone that fertility matters. Hopefully, it reminds people that IVF is a British story. Hopefully, it reminds people how brilliant British science is and can be. Hopefully, it has characters people care about, and some reasonable jokes. Hopefully, it\u2019ll make people cry (hopefully in a good way). It is a film made with love, and not a little pain. It is a film about good people who are admirable and who do a truly magnificent thing. It is not an unvarnished truth, but it is ultimately a celebration of them. I love them, Rachel loves them, Ben loves them, Finola and Amanda love them, and hopefully this film is a love note to&nbsp;them.</p> \n<p><em>Joy is in UK and Irish cinemas from 15 November and on <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81701716\">Netflix</a> from 22 November</em><br><br></p>",

In the 10 years between 1968 and 1978, Robert (Bob) Edwards, a scientist, Patrick Steptoe, an obstetrician, Jean Purdy, an embryologist, worked together, with many others, to do something incredible. Basing themselves in an outbuilding at Oldham general on scraps of money, with nurses volunteering their time, and patients their patience, they worked incessantly on the issue of infertility. Bob had had a number of breakthroughs working with mice and rabbits, and thought that with Patrick\u2019s innovations with laparoscopes (keyhole surgery), there was a possibility that tubal infertility could be, at least partially, cured. They faced a mass of opposition, societal and medical. They argued that infertility was a disease as deserving of attention and cure as any other. They were told that they were playing God, that they risked creating Frankenstein babies, that society was overpopulated as it was. The British medical establishment \u2013 rather than rewarding their progress \u2013 set out to destroy and decry their achievement. They fought on, despite everything, and managed to do something truly great: Louise Joy Brown was born on the 25 July 1978. There are now 12 million more children on the planet because of them. Born to people who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have been able to have them. It is, without doubt, one of the great medical breakthroughs of the 20th century. It is an amazing British story, one which I don\u2019t think many people know. And it\u2019s the reason why my partner and I have a child. It took Rachel [a comedy agent] and me seven rounds of IVF to have Elliott. What started as a journey where we told everyone, and almost celebrated doing it, became a brutal and dark time. Two years after we had him, Rach told me she\u2019d been ready to leave me had IVF not worked for us. She wanted me to have a child and decided I wanted and needed children more than I wanted and needed her. This wasn\u2019t true. But it was what she was thinking. I\u2019m going to quote her exactly here: \u201cI felt that it wasn\u2019t fair as the issue was mine. I was so desperate to have a child, I imagined you must have felt the same pain. It took over my life in so many ways, and everywhere I looked I couldn\u2019t escape it; pregnancies being announced, babies being born. I\u2019m glad Instagram reveals weren\u2019t a thing then. Or at least I wasn\u2019t aware of them.\u201d Now, ask anyone who knows us, and they\u2019ll say I\u2019m the lucky one of the partnership. In fact, you only need meet us for five minutes and you know it. My own dad, on the day before our wedding, told me: \u201cIf you mess this up, I will probably never forgive you.\u201d I never wanted children before I met her, she knew how much I loved her, but she couldn\u2019t get this thing out of her head \u2013 failing IVF was failing me. We both feel ashamed of that time, me with more reason. The fact that I didn\u2019t see her pain, the fact that I didn\u2019t reassure her, the fact that \u2013 as with a lot of things \u2013 I was very goal oriented (I used to quote fertility statistics at her after every failure: \u201cthe next round our percentage goes up 2.3%\u201d, etc). I let her down and left her in a very lonely place. I say all this because, I think, it is illustrative of the damage infertility can do. A damage that I hope fills every part of the film we wrote together, Joy. And the love and the joy we\u2019ve had from Elliott I hope fills it too. It all started with an email from my friends Finola Dwyer and Amanda Posey. They\u2019re a brilliant producing pair, makers of such incredible films as An Education and Brooklyn. They knew about Rachel and I\u2019s fertility journey, in fact Amanda had been on a similar journey herself with her own IVF child. They told me that Path\u00e9 was looking to make a film about IVF. It was a subject I knew a little bit about because of Elliott. In fact, I\u2019d pitched a play about it to the Manchester Royal Exchange, but I pitched badly \u2013 mainly talking about Edwards\u2019s mice \u2013 and they turned me down. Cameron McCracken, who ran the film division at Pathe, had a new way in. Telling a story around the character of Jean Purdy, the nurse and embryologist who worked with Bob and Patrick and a woman ignored in many people\u2019s celebration of IVF. I showed the idea to Rachel, and she said, \u201cYou have to do it.\u201d After sleeping on it for the night, I suggested at breakfast the next day \u2013 \u201cWhy don\u2019t we do it together?\u201d It took her a beat before she reluctantly agreed. This wasn\u2019t something I did lightly and it wasn\u2019t something she agreed to lightly. I have a slightly manic relationship with writing, of which she was well aware. She\u2019d seen and understood a lot of me, but we\u2019ve never been the sort of couple who wanted to share everything. I am autistic and temperamentally a loner. Writing is my safety net and governs a lot of my relationship with the world (are you seeing now how I am the lucky one?). When I am at my worst, Rachel will literally send me away to write. Sharing this with her, and she with me, meant her seeing the final part of my brain, my hidden bit. She was as nervous of this as I was. But I couldn\u2019t imagine doing it without her. Partly because Rachel has far more understanding of infertility than I do. After our experience, she\u2019d made it her duty to do more for people going through it, volunteering for the Fertility Network and running a monthly support group. But mainly because writing is an empathy leap that relies on biography. Even when writing a furious fallen angel, there are pieces of your past you put together to build that fallen angel. In this case, I didn\u2019t want to pick apart that piece of me without her picking it apart with me. The word \u201csurvivor\u201d is a grand word that\u2019s often misappropriated, and maybe it would be misappropriated here, but going through IVF was the hardest thing we\u2019d ever done, and I wanted to work on this with her. And thankfully, she wanted to work with me. Now this was bang in the middle of Covid, so we immediately started excavating, albeit from our locked-down home. Diving into archives. Reading everything we could. Watching everything we could. And talking to everyone we could. We\u2019d spend the lockdown day with Elliott, I did home school in the morning (as I mentioned, I\u2019m very goal oriented/the boring parent), she did play in the afternoon. Then in the evening we would sit and Skype or Zoom with someone from this history. Jenny Joy, Edwards\u2019s daughter, helped us talk to everyone involved. Because of her generosity and the generosity of so many people, we were able to talk to a number of key sources who helped us uncover this extraordinary story. Patrick and Bob wrote a beautiful book \u2013 that was our base, everything else we tried to build on top of that. We\u2019d find out shards of information and slowly that jigsaw puzzle of 1968-78 came puzzlingly into the light. Andrew Steptoe, Patrick\u2019s son, told us extraordinary stories about his father\u2019s life in the second world war, of him having to make extraordinary decisions on a rescue raft. We got insight into his family life, and love of music. But the bit we found most moving was that Patrick was one of three obstetric consultants at Oldham, but the only one who\u2019d perform newly legalised terminations, so he did them all. We never wanted this to be a film about women wanting babies, we wanted this to be a film about people having the choice whether or not to have babies. Suddenly, in Patrick, we had the ability to play this through the choices he made. We read as much as we could about Muriel Harris, with whom Patrick worked. Arguably the second woman excluded. An incredible operating theatre superintendent who found ways of making a largely volunteer rota work. Our favourite Muriel fact? That when she finally retired from Bourn Hall, the fertility unit they\u2019d set up together, she decided to get her pilot\u2019s licence. She succeeded in her 70s. I cannot tell you how many times we wrote that into the post-credits sequence at the end of the film. I am gutted it had to be cut. Bob\u2019s effervescence was legendary. Everyone we talked to talked about ideas and thoughts tumbling out of him. An hour in his company would be overwhelmingly full of exhausting thought. He never stopped making and thinking and doing. He even runs for parliament halfway through the film, an act which needs far more time than we can give it. His relationship with Ruth, his wife, and his children, was full of discussion and chaos. A true genius, whose pathway to genius was a really complicated road. You could make an entire eight-part TV series about Bob, and only capture half of him. And then there was Jean. The most private of all of them. We knew we wanted her to be central, but her centrality was dependent on knowing enough to build her out. The tragic part of Jean\u2019s story is that she was the first of the IVF group to die. She passed at the age of 39 from a malignant melanoma. Her final days were spent in a specially prepared room in Bourn Hall. She died in a place she made, and a place she loved. She was instinctively someone more comfortable in the background, and she left very little record of her life. We kept on trying to find her brother, but discovered he\u2019d died. We were desperate to get hold of her notebooks, but they couldn\u2019t be found. Rachel got in contact with the Churchill Archives Centre, which holds Bob\u2019s notebooks, articles, letters and lectures, and we started to piece her together. We questioned everyone about her, and discovered increasingly large slivers of information. About who she was and how she lived. Rach and I liked the way Louise Brown described her as \u201cmy first babysitter\u201d. In the lab, she was the first person to witness the cell division of the embryo that would become Louise. But our most moving conversation, and the one that shed most light on Jean, was with the remarkable Grace MacDonald. In 1979 Grace gave birth to the second IVF baby, Alastair. Grace gave us insight into the women at the heart of the programme, she even told us the name they gave themselves \u2013 \u201cthe ovum club\u201d. She gave us a new angle on Jean. It was Jean who truly ran the ovum club, looking after all these mothers-to-be. It was Jean that made them central. This film is not without its challenges. On the upside, these people have a clear aim, they know what they\u2019re doing, and by the end \u2013 they do it. Unfortunately, it takes them 10 years and much of the time they\u2019re on a road between Oldham and Cambridge. Progress, as with lots of science, comes in jumps and starts. If you marked off each year (we did) between 1968 and 1978, you\u2019d see huge amounts being achieved during certain years, and more or less nothing in others. It doesn\u2019t have the peanut-butter-smooth feeling that you might concoct if writing this without the facts. Thankfully, it was a film surrounded by fertility love. Not just us, and Amanda, for Ben Taylor, the brilliant director of Catastrophe and Sex Education, who got involved. Ben had two IVF children and a drive all of his own. With his engine now on board, we decided to make it feel like a sports film. I hope it doesn\u2019t exclusively fit that archetype, but the engine is a sports one. This is a film where the final achievement is known, this is a film where the impossible is made possible, this is a film where no one bloody helps them. They do it despite the odds. It\u2019s a miracle film. And sports films love a miracle. But it\u2019s a sports film where the stakes are gargantuan. It is a sports film which is literally about the essence of life, and the pain of being denied that life. My favourite scene in the film is one on a cold beach. Jean is talking to Trisha, one of the ovum club, and tells her that she\u2019s jealous of Rachel, who has just achieved the first pregnancy. The words are nothing special, but the actors Thomasin McKenzie and Charlie Murphy, who play Jean and Trisha respectively, imbue it with such truth and simple beauty, and somehow it sums up the cruelty of fertility for me. I think fertility is something we need to talk about. Uneasy though it seems to make everyone. Obviously, what\u2019s happening in America makes IVF a particular issue right now. Doctors being frightened to help patients because their intervention may be deemed an act of abortion. Reproductive rights are being truly threatened. But I also think how we feel and talk about IVF in this country needs thinking about too. IVF is now something you largely seem to pay for. Deemed a luxury good. It\u2019s become a postcode lottery that favours those that go private. Louise Brown\u2019s parents were working class: Lesley had a variety of jobs including working in a laundry, John was a lorry driver for British Rail. These were people who, when they first met, had been forced to sleep rough for a while. They were given the opportunity to have Louise through the bloody-minded perseverance of Bob, Patrick and Jean, and I think all three would be appalled that despite the progress made in IVF, other working-class parents are not given the opportunity now. Bob, on his many appearances on TV and the radio, would always say that infertility is a medical problem like any other. My experience, and the experience of many of my friends, is that infertility is also something that can do enormous damage. In no way am I saying that everyone wants babies. But some do. I know we live in a time when the NHS is cracking at the seams. But the rationing of fertility care does not make sense to me. People need to have a choice about whether they have children or not. A choice that, if we truly still have national healthcare provision, should not be imposed wholly by the government. Rationing of care is rationing of care, and I don\u2019t think fertility treatment should be rationed. I think being an IVF parent is a privilege. Being any parent is a privilege, of course. But there\u2019s something about struggling \u2013 really struggling to have a child \u2013 that changes your relationship with 2am wake-ups. The thing that unites all IVF parents is that we saw our kids when they were a dot on a screen or on a printout. Others get to see their babies when they\u2019re orange sized or bigger; I saw Elliott as literally a speck. I wouldn\u2019t change the way we made him and I am so grateful to Bob, Jean and Patrick that we were able to make him because of their chaotic, brilliant, ceaseless endeavour. Hopefully, this film reminds everyone that fertility matters. Hopefully, it reminds people that IVF is a British story. Hopefully, it reminds people how brilliant British science is and can be. Hopefully, it has characters people care about, and some reasonable jokes. Hopefully, it\u2019ll make people cry (hopefully in a good way). It is a film made with love, and not a little pain. It is a film about good people who are admirable and who do a truly magnificent thing. It is not an unvarnished truth, but it is ultimately a celebration of them. I love them, Rachel loves them, Ben loves them, Finola and Amanda love them, and hopefully this film is a love note to them. Joy is in UK and Irish cinemas from 15 November and on Netflix from 22 November",

No one remarked upon this; it was taken to be \u201cthe way normal society operates\u201d.</p> <p>Al-Gharbi was not describing the uber-rich Upper East Side or the billionaires\u2019 hangout of Scarsdale. He was a freshman at Columbia University. Those profiting from the \u201cracial caste system\u201d were fellow students, many of them vocal about social justice, but largely indifferent to the needs of those at the bottom of the social hierarchy on whose labour their lives rested.</p> <p>Four years later, many of these same students joined Black Lives Matter protests. Al-Gharbi watched as they demonstrated on Broadway in New York\u2019s Upper West Side, oblivious to the \u201chomeless Black men who didn\u2019t even have shoes\u201d sharing the same space.

If you want to understand what just happened in the US election, it is one of the more useful starting points. For the story of the election can be viewed from one perspective as that of the division between those who can see the disparity that so struck Al-Gharbi and those who can\u2019t or won\u2019t.</p> <p>Given that the Columbia activists were ignoring the tangible injustice all around them, why did they adopt the language of social justice? Or, to put it another way, what role does that language play in a world in which real injustice and inequality are ignored? Those were the questions that bugged Al-Gharbi as&nbsp;a student and lie at the heart of his book.</p> <p>His answer is that the language of social justice \u2013 \u201cwokeness\u201d if you will \u2013 is not about social justice at all but acts rather as an ideological glue binding together a section of the elite that want to keep climbing the ladder of privilege but don\u2019t want to see themselves as part of the elite.</p> <p>\u201cWoke\u201d is not a particularly useful term, more often used in disparagement than in analysis.

It is a social stratum that attempts to entrench itself within the elite, elbowing out others already there, by using the language of social justice to gain status and accrue \u201ccultural capital\u201d. Theirs is a struggle within the elite presented as a struggle against the elite on behalf of the poor and the dispossessed.</p> <p>This is not simply cynicism or hypocrisy, Al-Gharbi argues. Symbolic capitalists have constructed myths about their social roles that allow them genuinely to believe in fairness and equity while entrenching inequality and injustice, myths that have been accepted by many social institutions and power-brokers. The consequence is that the language of social justice has helped \u201clegitimize and obscure inequalities\u201d, allowing sections of the elite to \u201creinforce their elite status\u2026 often at the expense of those who are genuinely vulnerable, marginalized and disadvantaged\u201d.</p> <p>Many aspects of this argument have been expressed before, for instance by the cultural theorist Catherine Liu and the philosopher Ol\u00faf\u00e9mi T\u00e1\u00edw\u00f2.

PMI has a long history of lobbying and influence campaigns, including pushing against planned crackdowns on vaping. It has also invested heavily in promoting heated tobacco as an alternative to smoking and expects to ship around 140bn heated tobacco units in 2024, a 134% increase on its 59.7bn sales in 2019. The CoC is part of a trio of scientific advisory committees that provide independent advice to government departments on the potential health risks of chemicals found in pharmaceuticals, pesticides and consumer products. Members are often academics and other experts and hold the positions on a voluntary basis, advising ministers on policy. Prior to Dempsey\u2019s appointment, the CoC was involved in reviews of both e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products, two of PMI\u2019s product lines. Dempsey is believed to have been appointed to the committee following an evaluation and interview conducted by a three-person panel, including a Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) official, after stepping down from her full-time role with PMI to establish her own toxicology consultancy in the summer of 2019. While at PMI she played a key role in promoting the company\u2019s interests. In 2017, Dempsey complained to a Costa Rican newspaper that existing regulations in some countries were making it difficult for PMI to launch IQOS, and suggested that countries should change their regulatory frameworks to allow the company to promote the advantages of IQOS to consumers. Since being appointed to the CoC, Dempsey\u2019s work has included helping lead a workshop on assessing cancer risk for an audience including representatives from the Health and Safety Executive. The workshop\u2019s aim was to improve the chemical risk assessment process and regulatory requirements for carcinogens. Her other private work has included promoting essential oils to \u201chelp reduce your toxic load\u201d via her Science Speaks company, which is registered in Lausanne, Switzerland \u2013 near PMI\u2019s headquarters. She also organised a panel discussion at a conference of toxicologists in 2023 about the benefits of working on scientific advisory committees. It is not known whether her fellow committee members or the DHSC are aware of her history of promoting PMI\u2019s interests in the media and calling for more lax regulation. But Prof David Harrison, chair of the CoC, said members came from \u201cvery diverse backgrounds with many different declarations of interest\u201d, and were appointed after \u201ccareful scrutiny\u201d. He said the interview process involved a three-person panel including him, a lay person and a government representative and that \u201cfull consideration was given to declarations of interest and guidance available for appointments\u201d. \u201cParticular attention\u201d was given in \u201csensitive cases\u201d such as Dempsey\u2019s, he said, adding that the principles of \u201copenness, wide-ranging debate and transparency\u201d were prioritised at every stage\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The trailer for Netflix\u2019s latest multimillion-dollar venture starts with a dramatic drumbeat, the slap of glove on pad, and a familiar Brooklyn drawl. \u201cHe\u2019s a manufactured killer,\u201d says Mike Tyson, with almost cartoon relish. \u201cI am a natural-born killer.\u201d</p> <p>The camera then cuts to the man he will face in the early hours of Saturday UK time, the influencer Jake Paul. \u201cWe\u2019re going to war,\u201d predicts Paul, who made his fortune filming pranks such as I Sunk My Friend\u2019s Car And Surprised Him With A New One before an even more lucrative pivot into boxing. \u201cAnd he\u2019s getting knocked out.\u201d</p> <p>Forget the fact that Tyson is 58 and has not fought professionally since quitting on his stool against Kevin McBride nearly 20 years ago. Or that the 27-year-old Paul is a relative novice, who lost to the <em>Love Island</em> star Tommy Fury last year. More than 60,000 fans are expected to flock to the AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas to watch the fight in \u00adperson, with millions more streaming it&nbsp;online.</p> <p>But as the two men prepare to square off over eight two-minute rounds in exchange, rumours suggest, for more than $20m (\u00a315.5m) each, the questions linger starkly in the Texas air. Is this merely a grisly pantomime? Or should it be seen as a harbinger of what lies ahead? And, more intriguing, why is Netflix throwing millions at this meeting of boxing\u2019s old world with its new YouTube iteration? Especially when almost everyone in the sport believes it is a terrible idea.</p>    <p>Barry McGuigan, who was in his prime 40 years ago, sums up boxing\u2019s unease particularly eloquently. \u201cI\u2019m 63 and Tyson\u2019s only five years behind me,\u201d he tells the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cSo the idea of him boxing any guy, even if he\u2019s only ordinary, is just so wrong at that age. You are your reputation. That\u2019s what people remember. And I remember Mike Tyson as a \u00adwrecking&nbsp;machine.</p> <p>\u201cHe really was one of the most dangerous heavyweights that ever laced on gloves. There\u2019s no doubt about that. And I don\u2019t want people to say in 20 years\u2019 time: \u2018Oh, that\u2019s that guy that had that sham of a fight with that&nbsp;YouTuber.\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/08/jake-paul-v-mike-tyson-influencer-boxing\">Angry about Jake Paul v Mike Tyson? That\u2019s the whole point of \u2018influencer boxing\u2019 | Tom Usher</a> </p> </aside>  <p>McGuigan is generous to Paul, saying he can \u201cobviously box a bit\u201d. But that, for him, makes the risks even greater. \u201cA 58-year-old man shouldn\u2019t be fighting,\u201d he adds. \u201cHe just shouldn\u2019t. At that age your punch resistance invariably disappears. And while we see all these clips of Tyson doing the pads, that\u2019s not real. What\u2019s real is sparring against good quality opposition and seeing how you look then. You can be sure he\u2019s not doing that given his age.\u201d</p> <p>A very different perspective is offered by Adam Kelly, president of media at the global sports marketing agency IMG. Kelly accepts there are doubters, but predicts that Tyson v Paul has \u201cthe potential to break some of the all-time best ratings, and be one of the most viewed \u00adboxing matches of all time\u201d.</p> <p>Those are strong words, and they carry even more weight given that Kelly was part of the Floyd Mayweather versus Conor McGregor promotion in 2017, which was a pay-per-view smash and led the way for other crossover matches. In his current role, he also speaks regularly to major sports, organisations and broadcasters such as Netflix about how sport could look in the future.</p> <p>For Kelly, this fight is a part of the next iteration of how we will watch sport. The first came through commercial TV and advertising. The second from pay TV. This third wave is being powered by Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Google with YouTube.</p>    <p>\u201cSport is a major part of the attention economy, and these guys are the most effective in turning attention into earnings,\u201d he says. \u201cSo what they\u2019ll be able to do better than the existing players, is monetise audiences each and every time they watch.\u201d</p> <p>Tyson versus Paul is, in effect, the opening salvo for Netflix before its broadcast of live NFL Christmas Day games, World Wrestling Entertainment events next year and potential live sports in the future. So how can companies such as Netflix and Amazon compete with monthly charges from Sky or high pay-per-view fees? \u201cI think one of the challenges sport faces is direct \u00admonetisation from fans is kind of tapped out, to use an MMA expression,\u201d says Kelly. \u201cBut in the attention economy, of which sport is a key part, there are lots of other ways in which engagement and audience can \u00adconvert into earnings for companies.</p> <p>\u201cFor instance, can Amazon convert attention on sport into additional retail opportunities and channel even more spend to its online shopping? And can Netflix expand and enhance their advertising platform, which is already significant and growing?\u201d</p> <p>As Kelly points out, Netflix is approaching 300m households with its total subscriber base, as well as heading north of 50m on their ad-funded lower cost tier. \u201cAnd from their earnings, they believe those figures have significant potential to grow, and they will ultimately deliver a different model from simply having to charge sports fans more money, while also driving more earnings and more income into the game,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThe same is true for the other major tech companies. And if you draw these elements together, you can start to see something that\u2019s not an aberration. It\u2019s more of an upcoming trend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think we will look back at this and think: \u2018Well, this is the moment when Netflix caught fire when it comes to sport\u2019,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey are really pushing it. And I think it will be one of the biggest fights that has ever been broadcast.\u201d</p> <p>Many in boxing remain sceptical. The promoter Eddie Hearn has criticised the fight, calling it \u201cdangerous, irresponsible and disrespectful to boxing\u201d and ticket sales are said to have been sluggish. While McGuigan also fears the worst when the fight begins. \u201cI hope that it\u2019s proper, and it\u2019s not a load of choreographed nonsense,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I hope it\u2019s for real. But if Tyson in his 20s hit Jake Paul he would have put him in \u00adhospital for a week. Not now because he\u2019s an old man.\u201d</p> <p>However, as Kelly points out, the critics were also out in force before Mayweather fought McGregor. \u201cBoxing aficionados will tell you that McGregor was a terrible boxer, but I was there in Vegas, and it was exciting, and people bought into the fight in every single way,\u201d he says. \u201cI think this will be similar.</p> <p>\u201cWith that fight we were able to bring these two superstars from quite different audience groups together. It was the biggest pay-per-view global boxing event of all time [behind only Mayeather v Manny Pacquiao] and it kickstarted a trend where you saw the misfits, the influencers \u2013 the likes of Logan Paul, Jake Paul, KSI and others \u2013 began to realise that a lot of people will pay to experience a different sort of event.\u201d</p> <p>Make no mistake, it will be no different when Tyson returns to the ring. Some will tune in hope of seeing the former heavyweight champion deliver one final chilling knockout. Others because Netflix\u2019s algorithm has lured them in, or simply because they are curious about what will happen next. As one commenter on the official trailer on YouTube put it: \u201cIs this dumb? Yes. Will I watch? Yes.\u201d The reaction that followed suggested that plenty of others felt the same way.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The trailer for Netflix\u2019s latest multimillion-dollar venture starts with a dramatic drumbeat, the slap of glove on pad, and a familiar Brooklyn drawl. \u201cHe\u2019s a manufactured killer,\u201d says Mike Tyson, with almost cartoon relish. \u201cI am a natural-born killer.\u201d The camera then cuts to the man he will face in the early hours of Saturday UK time, the influencer Jake Paul. \u201cWe\u2019re going to war,\u201d predicts Paul, who made his fortune filming pranks such as I Sunk My Friend\u2019s Car And Surprised Him With A New One before an even more lucrative pivot into boxing. \u201cAnd he\u2019s getting knocked out.\u201d Forget the fact that Tyson is 58 and has not fought professionally since quitting on his stool against Kevin McBride nearly 20 years ago. Or that the 27-year-old Paul is a relative novice, who lost to the Love Island star Tommy Fury last year. More than 60,000 fans are expected to flock to the AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas to watch the fight in person, with millions more streaming it online. But as the two men prepare to square off over eight two-minute rounds in exchange, rumours suggest, for more than $20m (\u00a315.5m) each, the questions linger starkly in the Texas air. Is this merely a grisly pantomime? Or should it be seen as a harbinger of what lies ahead? And, more intriguing, why is Netflix throwing millions at this meeting of boxing\u2019s old world with its new YouTube iteration? Especially when almost everyone in the sport believes it is a terrible idea. Barry McGuigan, who was in his prime 40 years ago, sums up boxing\u2019s unease particularly eloquently. \u201cI\u2019m 63 and Tyson\u2019s only five years behind me,\u201d he tells the Observer. \u201cSo the idea of him boxing any guy, even if he\u2019s only ordinary, is just so wrong at that age. You are your reputation. That\u2019s what people remember. And I remember Mike Tyson as a wrecking machine. \u201cHe really was one of the most dangerous heavyweights that ever laced on gloves. There\u2019s no doubt about that. And I don\u2019t want people to say in 20 years\u2019 time: \u2018Oh, that\u2019s that guy that had that sham of a fight with that YouTuber.\u2019\u201d McGuigan is generous to Paul, saying he can \u201cobviously box a bit\u201d. But that, for him, makes the risks even greater. \u201cA 58-year-old man shouldn\u2019t be fighting,\u201d he adds. \u201cHe just shouldn\u2019t. At that age your punch resistance invariably disappears. And while we see all these clips of Tyson doing the pads, that\u2019s not real. What\u2019s real is sparring against good quality opposition and seeing how you look then. You can be sure he\u2019s not doing that given his age.\u201d A very different perspective is offered by Adam Kelly, president of media at the global sports marketing agency IMG. Kelly accepts there are doubters, but predicts that Tyson v Paul has \u201cthe potential to break some of the all-time best ratings, and be one of the most viewed boxing matches of all time\u201d. Those are strong words, and they carry even more weight given that Kelly was part of the Floyd Mayweather versus Conor McGregor promotion in 2017, which was a pay-per-view smash and led the way for other crossover matches. In his current role, he also speaks regularly to major sports, organisations and broadcasters such as Netflix about how sport could look in the future. For Kelly, this fight is a part of the next iteration of how we will watch sport. The first came through commercial TV and advertising. The second from pay TV. This third wave is being powered by Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Google with YouTube. \u201cSport is a major part of the attention economy, and these guys are the most effective in turning attention into earnings,\u201d he says. \u201cSo what they\u2019ll be able to do better than the existing players, is monetise audiences each and every time they watch.\u201d Tyson versus Paul is, in effect, the opening salvo for Netflix before its broadcast of live NFL Christmas Day games, World Wrestling Entertainment events next year and potential live sports in the future. So how can companies such as Netflix and Amazon compete with monthly charges from Sky or high pay-per-view fees? \u201cI think one of the challenges sport faces is direct monetisation from fans is kind of tapped out, to use an MMA expression,\u201d says Kelly. \u201cBut in the attention economy, of which sport is a key part, there are lots of other ways in which engagement and audience can convert into earnings for companies. \u201cFor instance, can Amazon convert attention on sport into additional retail opportunities and channel even more spend to its online shopping? And can Netflix expand and enhance their advertising platform, which is already significant and growing?\u201d As Kelly points out, Netflix is approaching 300m households with its total subscriber base, as well as heading north of 50m on their ad-funded lower cost tier. \u201cAnd from their earnings, they believe those figures have significant potential to grow, and they will ultimately deliver a different model from simply having to charge sports fans more money, while also driving more earnings and more income into the game,\u201d he says. \u201cThe same is true for the other major tech companies. And if you draw these elements together, you can start to see something that\u2019s not an aberration. It\u2019s more of an upcoming trend.\u201d \u201cI think we will look back at this and think: \u2018Well, this is the moment when Netflix caught fire when it comes to sport\u2019,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey are really pushing it. And I think it will be one of the biggest fights that has ever been broadcast.\u201d Many in boxing remain sceptical. The promoter Eddie Hearn has criticised the fight, calling it \u201cdangerous, irresponsible and disrespectful to boxing\u201d and ticket sales are said to have been sluggish. While McGuigan also fears the worst when the fight begins. \u201cI hope that it\u2019s proper, and it\u2019s not a load of choreographed nonsense,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I hope it\u2019s for real. But if Tyson in his 20s hit Jake Paul he would have put him in hospital for a week. Not now because he\u2019s an old man.\u201d However, as Kelly points out, the critics were also out in force before Mayweather fought McGregor. \u201cBoxing aficionados will tell you that McGregor was a terrible boxer, but I was there in Vegas, and it was exciting, and people bought into the fight in every single way,\u201d he says. \u201cI think this will be similar. \u201cWith that fight we were able to bring these two superstars from quite different audience groups together. It was the biggest pay-per-view global boxing event of all time [behind only Mayeather v Manny Pacquiao] and it kickstarted a trend where you saw the misfits, the influencers \u2013 the likes of Logan Paul, Jake Paul, KSI and others \u2013 began to realise that a lot of people will pay to experience a different sort of event.\u201d Make no mistake, it will be no different when Tyson returns to the ring. Some will tune in hope of seeing the former heavyweight champion deliver one final chilling knockout. Others because Netflix\u2019s algorithm has lured them in, or simply because they are curious about what will happen next. As one commenter on the official trailer on YouTube put it: \u201cIs this dumb? Yes. Will I watch? Yes.\u201d The reaction that followed suggested that plenty of others felt the same way.",

If, like me, you\u2019re somewhat allergic to the genre in its more twinkly and whimsical forms, fear not: this version has teeth.</p> <p>But there\u2019s something else at play here: <em>Bird</em> is told from the viewpoint of 12-year-old Bailey \u2013 played by phenomenal newcomer Nykiya Adams \u2013 growing up in an unconventional family unit that borders on the dysfunctional. Her home is a freewheeling, graffiti-daubed squat shared with a teenage half-brother, Hunter (fellow non-professional Jason Buda, who combines a child\u2019s moral certainties with an adult\u2019s propensity for violence), and her feckless, frequently topless, extravagantly tattooed dad, Bug (Barry Keoghan, rattling against the edges of the frame in a role he was born to play). Bug is about to be married to a woman he has known for three months, in a whirlwind ceremony he plans to fund through a new business venture: selling the psychotropic skin secretions of a \u201cdrug toad\u201d.

Slovakia and Azerbaijan beware. Whatever challenges await Jon Dahl Tomasson as he attempts to lead Sweden forward, the path is becoming relatively clear. The national team\u2019s hopes of finally moving past the Zlatan Ibrahimovic era will rest on a superstar duo rather than a superstar individual.</p> <p>Despite the relative statures of Portugal\u2019s Primeira Liga and the Premier League, there is little sense that Gy\u00f6keres is the junior partner in this new power couple. Isak is already one of the best strikers in England but everything about Gy\u00f6keres suggests that should he join his Sweden teammate here next summer, he can be at least as good.</p> <p>In many previous transfer windows, the 26-year-old\u2019s stellar first season at Sporting would have already sealed him a Premier League move, but belt-tightening among even the giants of the European game and the Portuguese champions\u2019 intransigence on the \u20ac100m (\u00a383m) release clause in Gy\u00f6keres\u2019 contract put a hold on that happening in 2024. It was circumstance and a new financial reality, rather than any reflection on his ability to reproduce on a bigger&nbsp;stage.</p> <p>This summer of stasis might have led to a hangover for lesser characters.

      "bodyText": "After a particularly tempestuous week or two in the life of Sporting Clube de Portugal, the forthcoming international window should have heralded calmer waters for a moment or two at least as the post-R\u00faben Amorim era moves into view. The emotional outpouring of the Manchester United-bound coach\u2019s final game at the Est\u00e1dio Jos\u00e9 Alvalade, the debagging of Manchester City, will seem like a few months ago by the middle of next week. Recent internationals suggest, however, the opposite may be true. If clubs fret over the possibility of star players speaking a little too frankly in their native tongues surrounded by a few home comforts, it is the forthcoming on-pitch deeds of Viktor Gy\u00f6keres that threaten to prop up European football\u2019s next salvo of gossip. Sweden\u2019s third-tier position in Uefa Nations League C is likely to continue to be made a mockery of by the burgeoning strike partnership of Gy\u00f6keres and Newcastle\u2019s Alexander Isak. Slovakia and Azerbaijan beware. Whatever challenges await Jon Dahl Tomasson as he attempts to lead Sweden forward, the path is becoming relatively clear. The national team\u2019s hopes of finally moving past the Zlatan Ibrahimovic era will rest on a superstar duo rather than a superstar individual. Despite the relative statures of Portugal\u2019s Primeira Liga and the Premier League, there is little sense that Gy\u00f6keres is the junior partner in this new power couple. Isak is already one of the best strikers in England but everything about Gy\u00f6keres suggests that should he join his Sweden teammate here next summer, he can be at least as good. In many previous transfer windows, the 26-year-old\u2019s stellar first season at Sporting would have already sealed him a Premier League move, but belt-tightening among even the giants of the European game and the Portuguese champions\u2019 intransigence on the \u20ac100m (\u00a383m) release clause in Gy\u00f6keres\u2019 contract put a hold on that happening in 2024. It was circumstance and a new financial reality, rather than any reflection on his ability to reproduce on a bigger stage. This summer of stasis might have led to a hangover for lesser characters. Not for Gy\u00f6keres. He has followed up his 43-goal debut campaign at the Alvalade with a staggering 28 for club and country already this term, including 16 in 10 league games (Sporting have won all 10 going into Amorim\u2019s last in charge, at his former club Braga on Sunday evening) and five in four in the Champions League, incorporating Tuesday night\u2019s hat-trick against City. Yet the goals don\u2019t tell the whole story. It is about how he marshals Sporting from the front, with the pace to get the team up the pitch, the physicality to lead and to occupy defenders and the technical ability to connect meaningfully with the talent around him, such as Pedro Gon\u00e7alves (Amorim\u2019s eventual choice as Bruno Fernandes\u2019 de facto replacement after he left for United) and Francisco Trinc\u00e3o. Gy\u00f6keres may not quite have the breakneck speed of Erling Haaland but he has become a similarly pitiless finisher and, unlike his fellow Scandinavian, he is a genuine creator too, with 10 assists in the league alone last season, carrying on a thread to his game that he honed at Coventry in the Championship. Having the physical strength is one thing and using it effectively is another. Gy\u00f6keres\u2019 personality is what really suggests he can become a fixture at elite level. When Sporting hosted Porto in the cl\u00e1ssico just before Christmas last year, he already had enough of a reputation in Liga circles for the great Pepe to single him out for some special treatment. Gy\u00f6keres never looked like bending or breaking for a second. He lapped the veteran after picking up the ball way out wide to score an 11th-minute opener and was all over the Portugal legend.

Still one of the world\u2019s better defenders right up until his retirement at the end of the season at 41 and outstanding against Arsenal later in that season\u2019s Champions League, he had rarely been taught a lesson like this. So where next for a player on such a seemingly inexorable course? The Premier League seems most likely, and Amorim was quite insistent to the Sporting board that Gy\u00f6keres was the centre-forward he needed in 2023, despite directors\u2019 reservations about parting with a club record \u20ac20m fee for a player from the English second tier.

In 2024, he went all in \u2013 raising millions of dollars and loudly making the case for his ally\u2019s political comeback</p> <p>Trump \u201cis going to build the greatest team to ever walk into government\u201d, Lutnick declared to a triumphant crowd at Madison Square Garden last month, with nine days left of the campaign. As transition co-chair, he is in charge of that construction.</p> <p>Lutnick has suggested he is uniquely qualified for this task. Speaking to the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/lutnick-consults-with-musk-kushner-wall-street-in-rush-to-staff-trump-white-house-baf83398\">Wall Street Journal</a>, he noted that Cantor Fitzgerald hired thousands of employees after most of its workforce died in the 11 September 2001 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/september11\">terrorist attacks</a>. Its office had been in the north tower of the World Trade Center.</p> <p>Inside the Palm Beach county convention center in the early hours of Wednesday morning, Lutnick watched from a few feet away as Trump addressed supporters for the first time after his victory. The financier was unavailable for an interview this week, according to a spokesperson.</p> <p>Amid tentative talks on the transition over recent weeks and months, Lutnick has pointed to two central beliefs: that Trump can restore American wealth, and that the wrong people were recruited to work for the former president when he first took office.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/27/trump-madison-square-garden-rally\">On stage at Madison Square Garden</a>, Lutnick explained what he thinks \u201cMake America great again\u201d actually means \u2013 and when, in his view, the US was sufficiently great: 1900. \u201cAt the turn of the century, our economy was rocking,\u201d he claimed. \u201cWe had no income tax, and all we had was tariffs.\u201d</p> <p>As taxes rose, and tariffs fell, generation after generation of US political leaders allowed \u201cthe rest of the world [to] eat our lunch\u201d, according to Lutnick, whose preferred course of action is clear: cut taxes and raise tariffs, as Trump has pledged.</p> <p>Trump made a lot of promises ahead of his first term. He delivered on some \u2013 huge tax cuts that disproportionately benefited the very wealthy \u2013 but failed on many others, such as repealing Obamacare, cutting the federal deficit and making Mexico pay for the border wall.</p> <p>Some of those who entered Trump\u2019s orbit in 2016, such as the former ExxonMobil boss Rex Tillerson, who served as secretary of state, steered away from some of his impulses and instincts. This time, though, Lutnick has sought to discourage the former president from enthusiastically welcoming other, less steadfastly loyal, business figures into the fold.</p> <p>When Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, called Trump the other week, Lutnick <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZ4V5Lytc6E\">claimed</a> on Fox News that he sent his friend a video he filmed the night before, of his Alexa smart speaker. When asked to play Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/26/trump-joe-rogan-interview-analysis\">interview with Joe Rogan</a>, it purportedly played the Prosecuting Donald Trump podcast instead. \u201cTell him to fix Alexa, and make it fair,\u201d Lutnick recalled telling Trump.</p> <p>But there are some figures, still relatively new to Trump\u2019s orbit, whom Lutnick has been more open to. He <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/31/politics/howard-lutnick-robert-f-kennedy-jr-vaccines-cnntv/index.html\">recently endorsed</a> vaccine conspiracy theories pushed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, who suspended his presidential run to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/23/rfk-suspends-campaign-supporters\">back Trump</a> this summer, after spending a few hours with the activist. Lutnick later <a href=\"https://x.com/howardlutnick/status/1851848114573054407\">wrote on social media</a> that he and his wife \u201ctrust our doctors\u201d, and that his family is vaccinated.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s operation has not universally embraced Lutnick. He stressed last month that the transition team was \u201csolely focused\u201d on ensuring the former president\u2019s victory, after Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/23/howard-lutnick-trump-transition-scrutiny-00184985\">reported</a> that some Trump loyalists had grown alarmed that he had improperly mixed his own business with efforts to staff the administration.</p> <p>Lutnick continues to run Cantor Fitzgerald, oversee a network of <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/11/04/howard-lutnick-spacs\">\u201cblank-check\u201d vehicles</a> and vocally advocate for the possibilities of crypto.

      "bodyText": "Scrambling to construct an administration in the wake of his shock victory eight years ago, Donald Trump looked far beyond his inner circle, and those who ardently embraced his agenda. Not this time. The president-elect has charged Howard Lutnick, a longtime friend, and one of the few high-profile figures in corporate America to vocally endorse his campaign, with recruiting officials who will deliver, rather than dilute, his agenda. The CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, and co-chair of Trump\u2019s transition team, has made no secret of his plan to stack the new White House with loyalists \u2013 and keep out anyone who threatens to derail his pledges. Last time around, Trump \u201cpicked unfortunately\u201d, Lutnick told NewsNation last month, describing the hires he made in his first term as \u201cfreshman\u201d mistakes. \u201cHe\u2019s the CEO. Why would you pick someone who\u2019s going to try to go the other direction? That would be silly.\u201d Lutnick, who says he talks to Trump every day, was on the sidelines in 2016 and 2020 when his friend won and lost the presidency. In 2024, he went all in \u2013 raising millions of dollars and loudly making the case for his ally\u2019s political comeback Trump \u201cis going to build the greatest team to ever walk into government\u201d, Lutnick declared to a triumphant crowd at Madison Square Garden last month, with nine days left of the campaign. As transition co-chair, he is in charge of that construction. Lutnick has suggested he is uniquely qualified for this task. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, he noted that Cantor Fitzgerald hired thousands of employees after most of its workforce died in the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. Its office had been in the north tower of the World Trade Center. Inside the Palm Beach county convention center in the early hours of Wednesday morning, Lutnick watched from a few feet away as Trump addressed supporters for the first time after his victory. The financier was unavailable for an interview this week, according to a spokesperson. Amid tentative talks on the transition over recent weeks and months, Lutnick has pointed to two central beliefs: that Trump can restore American wealth, and that the wrong people were recruited to work for the former president when he first took office. On stage at Madison Square Garden, Lutnick explained what he thinks \u201cMake America great again\u201d actually means \u2013 and when, in his view, the US was sufficiently great: 1900. \u201cAt the turn of the century, our economy was rocking,\u201d he claimed. \u201cWe had no income tax, and all we had was tariffs.\u201d As taxes rose, and tariffs fell, generation after generation of US political leaders allowed \u201cthe rest of the world [to] eat our lunch\u201d, according to Lutnick, whose preferred course of action is clear: cut taxes and raise tariffs, as Trump has pledged. Trump made a lot of promises ahead of his first term. He delivered on some \u2013 huge tax cuts that disproportionately benefited the very wealthy \u2013 but failed on many others, such as repealing Obamacare, cutting the federal deficit and making Mexico pay for the border wall. Some of those who entered Trump\u2019s orbit in 2016, such as the former ExxonMobil boss Rex Tillerson, who served as secretary of state, steered away from some of his impulses and instincts. This time, though, Lutnick has sought to discourage the former president from enthusiastically welcoming other, less steadfastly loyal, business figures into the fold. When Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, called Trump the other week, Lutnick claimed on Fox News that he sent his friend a video he filmed the night before, of his Alexa smart speaker. When asked to play Trump\u2019s interview with Joe Rogan, it purportedly played the Prosecuting Donald Trump podcast instead. \u201cTell him to fix Alexa, and make it fair,\u201d Lutnick recalled telling Trump. But there are some figures, still relatively new to Trump\u2019s orbit, whom Lutnick has been more open to. He recently endorsed vaccine conspiracy theories pushed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, who suspended his presidential run to back Trump this summer, after spending a few hours with the activist. Lutnick later wrote on social media that he and his wife \u201ctrust our doctors\u201d, and that his family is vaccinated. Trump\u2019s operation has not universally embraced Lutnick. He stressed last month that the transition team was \u201csolely focused\u201d on ensuring the former president\u2019s victory, after Politico reported that some Trump loyalists had grown alarmed that he had improperly mixed his own business with efforts to staff the administration. Lutnick continues to run Cantor Fitzgerald, oversee a network of \u201cblank-check\u201d vehicles and vocally advocate for the possibilities of crypto. It remains unclear what precise role he will play once Trump re-enters the White House, but he wants to help lead a bid (alongside Elon Musk) to drastically cut federal spending as part of a government efficiency commission. During a recent two-hour podcast appearance, Lutnick was in the midst of a detailed account of his ascent in finance when he stopped to describe his relationship with Trump. \u201cHe hears me,\u201d Lutnick said of the president-elect. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t always listen to what I say. He didn\u2019t always do what I say.

The text of the proposed amendment on state ownership says: \u201cThe Bill must exclude the possibility that an owner of a club could be a state or state-controlled person or entity.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/08/states-of-play-making-sense-of-footballs-descent-into-the-morass\">States of Play: making sense of football\u2019s descent into the morass</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The football governance bill was relaunched by the Labour government last month and will receive its formal second reading in the Lords on Wednesday. While the focus of the bill is largely the same as when first drafted by the previous government, there have already been some changes in emphasis. This includes the deletion of a clause that the regulator must take into consideration the government\u2019s foreign policy objectives before making decisions.</p> <p>Fair Game now wants to put greater focus on ensuring stricter criteria for club owners, with the regulator conducting assessments of potential owners as part of its remit. \u201cThe secretary of state, Lisa Nandy, and the DCMS [the Department for Culture, Media and Sport] have improved the previous Bill put forward by the last government,\u201d said Niall Couper, the founder and CEO of Fair Game. \u201cHowever, there is still room for improvement to ensure the regulator has the teeth required.</p> <p>\u201cAs an organisation we want to ensure that a fair financial flow is top of the agenda. We also want assurances that the regulator cannot be influenced by vested interests and we want guarantees that clubs receive the support they need.</p> <p>\u201cWe will be calling on the Lords, where this bill will have its second reading, to take on board our concerns and to implement the changes needed. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get this right for our national game. It has to be seized.\u201d</p> <p>Fair Game believes its proposals have growing support among peers, who can suggest amendments to the bill as it continues its passage through parliament. Amendments must be approved by both chambers of the house before they can be added to the bill, but with a substantial Labour majority now in the Commons, MPs may be more receptive to changes that put greater emphasis on an owner\u2019s integrity.</p> <p>Objections to state ownership in football often relate to the potential distortion of competition, but the possibility of human rights violations have also caused concern. In 2020, Amnesty called on the Premier League to take action on sportswashing and include a human rights assessment in its own owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test. In 2023, the Premier League updated its owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test to include \u201ca new disqualifying event for human rights abuses\u201d. Thisdoes not exist in the regulator\u2019s proposed ODT.</p> <p>Other suggested amendments to the bill relate to the distribution of finances down the football pyramid. Fair Game argues the bill should be amended to ensure the regulator acts to \u201cclose the growing financial gap between divisions, rewarding well-run clubs and providing adequate compensation for the development of players\u201d.</p> <p>Another suggests the regulator should have the ability to activate unilaterally its backstop power to force a financial settlement on the Premier League and EFL. The existing text says that only a negotiating party has the power to do this.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Proposed changes to the football regulator that would ensure clubs could not be sold to nation states are to be put before the House of Lords, as legislation returns to parliament this week. Nineteen changes to the football governance bill have been proposed by Fair Game, an organisation of 34 men\u2019s clubs that argues for a more sustainable approach to running the national sport. Other proposals include the addition of a human rights component to owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 tests and a mandate to disclose the source of an owner\u2019s funds. The text of the proposed amendment on state ownership says: \u201cThe Bill must exclude the possibility that an owner of a club could be a state or state-controlled person or entity.\u201d The football governance bill was relaunched by the Labour government last month and will receive its formal second reading in the Lords on Wednesday. While the focus of the bill is largely the same as when first drafted by the previous government, there have already been some changes in emphasis. This includes the deletion of a clause that the regulator must take into consideration the government\u2019s foreign policy objectives before making decisions. Fair Game now wants to put greater focus on ensuring stricter criteria for club owners, with the regulator conducting assessments of potential owners as part of its remit. \u201cThe secretary of state, Lisa Nandy, and the DCMS [the Department for Culture, Media and Sport] have improved the previous Bill put forward by the last government,\u201d said Niall Couper, the founder and CEO of Fair Game. \u201cHowever, there is still room for improvement to ensure the regulator has the teeth required. \u201cAs an organisation we want to ensure that a fair financial flow is top of the agenda. We also want assurances that the regulator cannot be influenced by vested interests and we want guarantees that clubs receive the support they need. \u201cWe will be calling on the Lords, where this bill will have its second reading, to take on board our concerns and to implement the changes needed. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get this right for our national game. It has to be seized.\u201d Fair Game believes its proposals have growing support among peers, who can suggest amendments to the bill as it continues its passage through parliament. Amendments must be approved by both chambers of the house before they can be added to the bill, but with a substantial Labour majority now in the Commons, MPs may be more receptive to changes that put greater emphasis on an owner\u2019s integrity. Objections to state ownership in football often relate to the potential distortion of competition, but the possibility of human rights violations have also caused concern. In 2020, Amnesty called on the Premier League to take action on sportswashing and include a human rights assessment in its own owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test. In 2023, the Premier League updated its owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test to include \u201ca new disqualifying event for human rights abuses\u201d. Thisdoes not exist in the regulator\u2019s proposed ODT. Other suggested amendments to the bill relate to the distribution of finances down the football pyramid. Fair Game argues the bill should be amended to ensure the regulator acts to \u201cclose the growing financial gap between divisions, rewarding well-run clubs and providing adequate compensation for the development of players\u201d. Another suggests the regulator should have the ability to activate unilaterally its backstop power to force a financial settlement on the Premier League and EFL. The existing text says that only a negotiating party has the power to do this.",

The foundations of transatlantic relations frequently shuddered during the first Trump term. Britain\u2019s defence and foreign policy establishments are seized with a justifiably deep apprehension that the world will become an even more dangerous place during the sequel. </p> <p>Sir Keir\u2019s effusions have been accompanied by a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2439897mg2o\">big effort</a> to persuade everyone that he and his team have been working assiduously to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/07/no-10-believes-it-has-done-its-homework-for-a-trump-presidency\">cultivate relations</a> with members of the Trump court, including vice-president-elect JD Vance, with whom David Lammy boasts he\u2019s grown friendly. The foreign secretary wins the gold medal for diplomatic gymnastics. Six years ago, when he was a backbencher, he called the then and now future US president \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/08/david-lammy-dismisses-past-criticism-donald-trump-old-news\">a woman-hating</a>, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath\u201d and \u201ca profound threat to the international order\u201d. Mr Lammy has never recanted those views, but now <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm2z1zm1pk3o\">feels obliged</a> to assert that the British government \u201cwill agree and align on much\u201d with the Trump regime. Operation Ingratiate is controversial within Sir Keir\u2019s party and some are already questioning its wisdom. The vast majority of Labour people, sharing the shock and anguish of their cousins in the Democratic party, are more in sympathy with the Trump-denouncing Mr&nbsp;Lammy of yesteryear than they are with the Trump-clasping Mr Lammy of today. Some Labour MPs mutter that Sir Keir is fooling himself if he really thinks he can win the ear of the other man. The concern is that this will be a fruitless pursuit that will earn only embarrassing rebuffs. Theresa May\u2019s slavish attempts to woo the American were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/13/mps-voice-outrage-at-repulsive-donald-trump-broadside-against-theresa-may\">rewarded with insults</a> and humiliations \u2013 and she was a Conservative prime minister.

Isaah Yeo was immense for the Australians, laying a game high 45 tackles, with Hudson Young (44) and Harry Grant (40) contributing to incredible Australian defence. That was the difference. Tonga came to play, scored first and hurt Australia physically and on the scoreboard.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for your company on this glorious Sunday for the rugby codes in Australia. The Wallabies beat England at Twickenham this morning and the Kangaroos have done the job on Tonga this arvo in Parramatta. Does that mean footy season is FINALLY OVER?, my daughter asks? Not yet, darlin. The men\u2019s promotion-relegation play-off between New Zealand and the PNG Kumuls is about to kick off. Enjoy! From all the team here at the Guardian, we wish you a good night and a safe summer. See you next footy season! Tom Dearden has been named Player of the Match \u2013 a worthy winner given how he sliced and diced the Tonga defensive line. With Moses calm beside him, the little Queenslander led Australia to victory with his energy, smart passes, clever darts and excellent support play. Not a bad replacement for the injured Nathan Cleary! The Kangaroos have done it! The whistle blows on a mighty victory. They were tested by Tonga and had to dig deep in defence and attack to ward off the challenge. Isaah Yeo was immense for the Australians, laying a game high 45 tackles, with Hudson Young (44) and Harry Grant (40) contributing to incredible Australian defence. That was the difference. Tonga came to play, scored first and hurt Australia physically and on the scoreboard. Australia took their lumps and stayed patient, grabbing their chances when they could, with the class of Tom Trbojevic and Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow too much for the Tongan outside men. 79th minute: Australia 20-14 Tonga. Tom Trbojevic slices through and gets within 10 metres. Now Australia get a sniff of one more try. Carrigan clears to Dearden and he finds Moses and it lands with big Xavier Coates flying on the outside. He soars and scores! But hang on, in the action of flying up and over the touchline, he\u2019s muffed the grounding and it\u2019s slipped free of his fingers at the last instant. Might be too late for Tonga anyway\u2026 78th minute: Australia 20-14 Tonga. Lindsay Smith is on for Australia and it brings fortune to the Kangaroos immediately as Moses is taken out in the air by Jason Taumalolo. Silly mistake by the veteran. Will it cost his side? No, but Siliva Havili\u2019s forward pass out of dummy half might. It gifts the Kangaroos possession 40 metres out. Try to Eli Katoa! Tonga are within striking distance and we have a grandstand finish coming! The crowd are on their feet chanting and cheering 74th minute: Australia 20-10 Tonga. Almost a try! Referee Ashley Klein says no but this looks good. And it is good! 72nd minute: Australia 20-10 Tonga. Huge error from Pat Carrigan. The big bearded Bronco had just come back onto the field and he coughed it up in the tackle. Tonga on the attack 20 metres out now. Jason Taumalolo thunders into the line but one of the follow up runs has gone bung as Isaah Yeo forces the ball loose with a crunching captain\u2019s tackle. It earns Yeo an early shower as Matt Burton trots on to close this game out. 70th minute: Australia 20-10 Tonga. Australia get a much-needed breather as Lindsay Lindsay Collins and Angus Crichton reel from a head clash. Friendly fire for the Roosters pair and it\u2019s Collins who came off second best. It gets enough air back in the lungs for the Kangaroos to pull of a ripping tackle and for the Kangaroos to swoop on the crumbs. 68th minute: Australia 20-10 Tonga. We have a crowd of 28,728 but they have been of one voice this afternoon. Now the red army have a new reason to cheer. Harry Grant has throw a forward pass on halfway! It sets Tonga for a fresh wave of attack. Haumole Olakau\u2019atu hammers the line followed by Felise Kaufusi as Tonga inch closer and closer. 66th minute: Australia 20-10 Tonga. Another set for Tonga. It was a great kick by Isaiya Katoa, angled for the corner and high enough to sow panic in the Australian ranks. Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow won the jump but failed to haul it in cleanly, instead chesting it to Angus Crichton who stood a fraction in fron tof him. Here they come again! 64th minute: Australia 20-10 Tonga. Tolutau Koula sends Harry Grant flying! After looking a little ragged in the early clinches of this second half, Tonga have found another gear. Now they\u2019ve forced an error from Hudson Young and will attack from 30 metres out. Pressure for the Kangaroos 60th minute: Australia 20-10 Tonga. With the wind in their sails and the choir in their ears, Tonga are making their move. Jason Taumalolo leads their charge after that all-important try. There is plenty of time for the visitors here, a full quarter of the game remaining. Kangaroos coach Mal Meninga detects the danger and brings on fresh horses in debutant Lindsay Smith. He\u2019ll need them! Crichton gets monstered by four Tongans. Great try to Haumole Olakau\u2019atu! They stretched the Kangaroos backline on the last play and they attacked again, this time with a kick through the line where Olakau\u2019atu timed his run to perfection, stopping on the tryline and waiting for the ball to fall into his hands before dotting down. Tonga roar back and it\u2019s game on in the Pacific Cup final! 56th minute: Australia 20-4 Tonga. Jason Taumalolo is back on the field and it takes a tenacious Hudson Young to stop him bursting into space. Momentum has swung the way of the visitors now and they have Australia stretched to the left. Lomax has to charge the red line and knock down the ball to stop the overlap. 54th minute: Australia 20-4 Tonga. Tonga are emptying the bench looking for fresh legs and new ideas. They have now used five substitutes whereas Australia have only used two. Tonga look tired and Australia sense it. They go for the jugular, sweeping left where Tom Trbojevic finds Zac Lomax. He kicks infield but it\u2019s too big and races over the dead ball line. The Tongan choir know it\u2019s now or never. They raise their voices to inspire their side. What a glorious sound that is. 50th minute: Australia 20-4 Tonga. What a run by Sione Katoa! Tonga were desperately defending their line when the big No 4 shot out of the line and intercepted. He got 60 metres before Australia caught up with him. But when they did there were five guys in green and gold and none in red. Katoa stopped, stepped, charged again. Finally the Tongan support arrives but they promptly dropped the ball! 48th minute: Australia 20-4 Tonga. Almost another Trbojevic try but it\u2019s a tap-on from Tabuai-Fidow that has been ruled forward. Tonga escape! But they need to up the intensity fast because Australia have exploded in this second-half. Mitch Barnett puts his extremely rude haircut over the ball with a big run and it sets up Moses for a little chip which Tabuai-Fidow chases. Tonga are pinned in their own half. 45th minute: Australia 20-4 Tonga. Grant tries the same trick but it doesn\u2019t come off this time. But Moses has plenty of time to kick and it\u2019s that slingshot Zac Lomax who contests the kick. Tonga clean it up. Paul Alamoti has left the field with a dislocated shoulder after being the nail to Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow\u2019s hammer in a tackle just now. Harry Grant had a snipe from dummy half and it caught Tonga unawares. Dearden was on his hip and he spun out of contact and took off. He veered left but there were red jerseys swarming so he stepped right and found a green and gold one in support. Tom Trbojevic was wearing that jersey and the Mayor of Manly sprinted home, stepping a defender in the in-goal to touch down under the posts. 42nd minute: Australia 14-4 Tonga. Australia take the kickoff and it\u2019s a captain\u2019s run from Isaah Yeo that gets Australia rumbling to halfway where Moses puts it on the boot. Lomax chases like a dog pursuing a meatwagon but this time he can\u2019t haul it down from the heavens. Tonga run it out of trouble. Tonga coach Kristian Woolf refuses to be intimidated. He reckons Australia has scored their tries off the back of his side\u2019s errors and that the 10-point margin doesn\u2019t reflect how close this match has been. Here we go for the second half\u2026 What a torrid half of rugby league that was! Tonga shot from the blocks, roughing Australia up with their bone-jarring defence and Sione Katoa cashed in by scoring in the corner inside 10 minutes. Australia looked rattled for a while but, despite being battered and bruised they managed to counter-punch when the chance finally came. Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow scored the equaliser in the 16th minute and then threw a lovely pass in contact to Xavier Coates who gave Australia an 8-4 lead in the 27th. Tonga\u2019s early passion seemed to sap gtheir attacking spark and a couple of costly errors gave the Kangaroos a chance to run over the top of them in the final moments of the half. Trbojevic found the stripe in the 36th minute and then almost scored twice in the shadows of half-time. Only desperate defence from Tinga kept him out. It\u2019s abten point margin here in Parramatta but rest assured this Pacific Cup final remains on a knife edge. 39th minute: Australia 14-4 Tonga. Have Australia scored again?! Tom Trbojevic looks to have planted this ball down. No! There\u2019s a hand underneath and it belongs to Lehi Hopoate. Great try-saver in the shadows of halftime! But Australia retain possession and again it\u2019s Trbojevic lunging for the line. Great scramble defence stops him one metre from the chalk and this time it\u2019s Tolutau Koula with the try-saver. Good desperation from the men in red. That\u2019ll be halftime. He\u2019s not much of a kicker, Tom Dearden, but his running game is wonderful. And he used it to catch the Tongans napping there, sprinting 30 metres upfield. Tom Trbojevic went with him and crossed under the posts. Lomax finally nails a conversion. 36th minute: Australia 8-4 Tonga. Tonga have been impressive in defence but scattergun in attack. They reef it downfield from their own half and Coates takes it cleanly. Edwards darts in for good metres and Lomax does likewise. Dearden smalls a whiff of panic and gets the fast play-the-ball he wants. He jags left, jinks left and looks for support. Here it comes\u2026 and it\u2019s Turbo-charged! 34th minute: Australia 8-4 Tonga. Pat Carrigan is off for Australia and Mitch Barnett is on. Dearden tries to take on the defence but the red line holds firm. Now there\u2019s a dink kick for Tom Trbojevic. He bats it back and Hudson Young is there to take it and touchdown. Try? Looks like Trbojevic\u2019s tapback might have gone forward\u2026 33rd minute: Australia 8-4 Tonga. Tom Dearden elects to run on the last and he\u2019s tackled easily. Strange option and it gives Tonga a chance to run it out of their own quarter. They do so with gusto through Soni Luke who is on from the bench. Australia look exhausted from all their defensive work but they\u2019re hanging on grimly. Tonga need structure here. Their forwards have done the heavy lifting, now their backs have to step up. Isaiya Katoa spins out of a tackle and gets an offload away and Tonga cross\u2026 but I think they\u2019ve lost this over the line. Yes. No try. 30th minute: Australia 8-4 Tonga. Reuben Cotter runs it back from the kickoff. He deserves a medal of valoiur for that feat right now. The Tongan tackling today has been ferocious. Now it\u2019s Keaon Koloamatangi bending the line. Good run by the big Bunny. But it all falls apart with a knock-on. Australia on the counter-attack! Great play by Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow there. He was jammed either side but somnehow snaked an arm out of the tangle of limbs to loop a pass to Xavier Coates who had acres of space either side. He swooped into the corner and Australia are ahead. Lomax puts another conversion wide. 26th minute: Australia 4-4 Tonga. Having absorbed those hammer blow tackles, Australia are now on the attack. Dearden goes left and Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow gets hit by three men. Somehow he wriggles free. Who\u2019s loose? Xavier Coates! 24th minute: Australia 4-4 Tonga.Tom Dearden just got smashed and now it\u2019s Felise Kaufusi hammering Angus Crichton! This is fearsome stuff by Tonga. Mitchell Moses kicks it out of trouble and again it\u2019s Zac Lomax who flies high on the touchline. He misses the mark but the ball is flicked back but Taumalolo picks it up in goal and can\u2019t get out. Kangaroos ball. 22nd minute: Australia 4-4 Tonga. Jason Taumalolo is leading from the front here. That\u2019s another charge that sends Kangaroos pin-balling away. It creates the space down the left and they\u2019ve opened the Kanharoos up. One pass, two and they\u2019re in! Or was that an obstruction\u2026? We\u2019ll go to the Bunker here. 20th minute: Australia 4-4 Tonga. Now it\u2019s Tonga charging into the teeth of the green and gold defensive line. But another poor kick gives it back to Australia. But Dylan Edwards has dropped it cold on tackle two. Tuimoala Lolohea picks it up 20 metres out and after three bone rattling hit-ups, Isaiya Katoa dabs a neat grubber at the posts which Dylan Edwards is forced to run dead. Tonga on top at CommBank! That was a poor kick from Katoa that gave the Kangaroos a sniff. They had been defending their line for repeat sets but Katoa\u2019s muffed bomb gave them the glimmer they needed and Dearden scooted away and offloaded to Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow who flew into the corner for the equaliser. Lomax\u2019s kick sails wide. 15th minute: Australia 0-4 Tonga. Great charge by Tolutau Koula gets Tonga another set and Tonga are on fire. Thery are two metres out and going to their lethal right side again. It sputters out and Australia counter through Dearden. He\u2019s away! And who\u2019s looming in support but The Hammer himself\u2026 13th minute: Australia 0-4 Tonga. Almost another try to Sione Katoa! He flew high to take the bomb but Harry Grant of all people was there to catrch the crumbs and charge it out of trouble. Australia roll it downfield and will get a fresh set now. They attack to the right, fast hands but slow progress and finally it breaks down when Zac Lomax spills it. That was awesome pressure defence by Tonga. Australia look a little rattled. 10th minute: Australia 0-4 Tonga. The Kangaroos are under massive pressure now. They are struggling to get out of their own end but the Tongan torpedoes are cutting them down before they make five metres. Remember what\u2019s at stake today: Australia has not been beaten on home soil since 2015 and Tonga are aiming for back-to-back Test wins for the first time since World Cup 2021. The Tongan choir is booming right now. The Mate Ma\u2019a are over ! This was beautiful play and Isaiya Katoa was the spark. He drew two with the dummy and made space on the outside. Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow got sucked in and fast hands got it to Sione Katoa who speared over in the corner to score. 5th minute: Australia 0-0 Tonga. Both sides look dangerous as Australia\u2019s lethal centre pairing Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow and Tom Trbojevic get a shimmy-shimmy going down the touchline and make good ground. With the songs of their people ringing out across the stadium, Tonga scramble them down. But it\u2019s Australia on the attack\u2026. until Crichton coughs it up in contact. Another early mistake from Angus! 2nd minute: Australia 0-0 Tonga. Here we go! Thunderous contact as Tonga receive the first kickoff and Siliva Havili powers back into the line. The visitors take 50-metres from their first set while the Kanfgaoos can only manage 30. The men inred have it back and are on the attack with good field position. Early pressure for the Aussies. Better than any anthem, here is the Tongan war cry, with Siliva Havili leading the \u2018Sipi Tau\u2019. The Kangaroos are facing it a boomerang formation. The crowd are going bananas. As we hear a stirring rendition of the Tongan national anthem, CommBank Stadium is a sea of red as Tongan fans pack in hoping their boys deliver a fat slice of history to a population of 107,773 back home. Advance Australia Fair answers the call and the players retreat to their respective corners ready for battle. Here we go\u2026 If you missed last week\u2019s match between New Zealand and Tonga you missed something very special. Racing into a 24\u20130 first-half lead amid a sea of red and black in Auckland, Tonga looked unstoppable as Sione Katoa, man-of-the-match Addin Fonua Blake, Silvia Havili and Soni Luke all crossed the whitewash. But, in a remarkable comeback, the Kiwis came either side of half-time, scoring four converted tries of their own to lock the scoreboard up at 24-all. Jamayne Isaako\u2019s long-range penalty and further drop-goal attempts from the winger and Shaun Johnson all went wide. Then 20-year-old half Isaiya Katia put his name up in lights with a field goal to give the Mate Ma\u2019a a famous 25\u201324 win and booking Tonga\u2019s place in the final. Latest team news Kangaroos: Australia have one major out with South Sydney captain Cameron Murray succumbing to a wrist injury. Canberra\u2019s Hudson Young moves into the starting side while Penrith Panther Lindsay Smith joins the bench on Test debut. Ben Hunt will again serve as the replacement player. Tonga XIII: Good news for Tonga with the late mail that Keaon Koloamatangi will play. The big Rabbitohs enforcer, Cam Murray\u2019s best mate since childhood, was on tenterhooks with Mrs K to give birth any day now but will now join the bench. That\u2019s awesome commitment to the cause by Mrs Koloamatangi! Big Keaon\u2019s inclusion means there\u2019s no room for Sitili Tupouniua, who instead becomes the replacement player. Hello sports fans and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the men\u2019s Pacific Championship final between Australia and Tonga at CommBank Stadium in Parramatta, lands of the Burramattagal people, a clan of the Dharug. What a game we have before us today. The Kangaroos qualified for this final after defeating Tonga 18-0 in week one and defeating 2023 champions New Zealand 22-10 in week two. Tonga recovered from that early defeat to Mal Meninga\u2019s men with a shock 25-24 triumph over the Kiwis last weekend in Auckland, with Addin Fonua-Blake and Jason Taumalolo combining for 422 run metres and young gun Isaiya Katoa icing the one-point win. Prior to their opening round encounter, Tonga and Australia had met twice before in a rugby league internationals, with honours even. Australia won the first encounter at Mount Smart Stadium in 2018. Tonga avenged that defeat in 2019 when Jason Taumalolo led his team to a famous 16-12 triumph at Eden Park. Now they meet again to crown the 2024 Pacific champions. Can Tonga become the first Pacific nation to win the final of a major tournament? Or will Australia restore balance to the rugby league universe by continuing on their unbeaten way? The action is not far off so buckle \u2018em up and batten \u2018em down because the kickoff is 4.05pm and we\u2019ll have team news shortly.",

      "body": "<p>Good advice respects the recipient\u2019s autonomy, offering insights without taking away their sense of agency. It is rooted in empathy, aiming to uplift and empower, rather than control. It aims to provide clarity and direction while encouraging self-reflection, allowing the person to find their own answers. Most importantly, good advice is given at the right time, when the recipient is open and ready to hear it. On point, well-timed advice is one thing, but not all advice is wanted.</p>    <p>Unwelcome advice is a common problem, especially in the age of social media, where everyone feels free to offer their opinions without being asked. This kind can feel patronising. It often implies that the person receiving advice is not capable of handling their own challenges. While unwanted advice can feel intrusive, navigating how to receive it can be just as challenging. One strategy is to recognise that advice often reflects the experiences and perspectives of the person giving it. It may say more about their worldview than it does about you. If you still feel defensive, ask yourself why. Resistance can sometimes mask a fear of vulnerability. For example, do you need to see yourself as someone who already has all the answers? Feeling as though you should already know something can evoke shame, making it hard to accept guidance.</p> <p>Socrates emphasised the value of humility and openness in learning. He believed that embracing our ignorance is the first step towards wisdom \u2013 advice I\u2019m taking on. Ultimately, the best advice, whether given or received, opens up new perspectives and helps us grow. <em><strong>Philippa Perry</strong></em></p> <h2>Joan Armatrading</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Never be afraid to pursue what you truly want\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The best advice I ever received came from my grandmother, via my mother: \u201cNever be afraid to pursue what you truly want.\u201d These words have stayed with me all my life. I didn\u2019t have a background in music. My father showed me how to tune the guitar then left me to it, after my mother swapped two old prams to buy the instrument. Everything else, I taught myself: songwriting, performing, producing, engineering and more. Being afraid to try anything new can hold you back: I debuted my first symphony last year. My grandmother\u2019s simple yet powerful message reminds me to always follow my own path.<br><em>How Did This Happen and What Does It Now Mean? is out on 22 November on BMG</em></p> <h2>Sir Michael Caine</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Champions and stars don\u2019t wallow in misfortune, they get up and get on with it\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p> I came up with this nugget myself. \u201cGet on with it\u201d works for everything in life: apply for a job, apply for a course, get in shape, learn a skill, ask a successful person for advice and mentoring. Keep moving and trying new things. I treated myself as a one-man studio, a one-man operation, determined to do the work I wanted to by hook or by crook. Have the patience to wait for the breakthrough and don\u2019t expect it to come about in a predictable way. I was just about the last of my gang of actors to become famous.<br><em>Don\u2019t Look Back, You\u2019ll Trip Over: My Guide to Life by Michael Caine is out now</em></p> <h2>Nadiya Hussain</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Anger is often more harmful than the injury that caused it\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>My Year 8 teacher told us this, following endless class arguments. He sadly passed away that year, but the advice stuck with me. I was an angry child: dismissive and pessimistic. He made me realise how destructive this can be, making situations worse and distracting from the problem that needs solving. I\u2019m learning to be better at holding that anger back, taming it and returning to it with understanding.<br><em>Cook Once, Eat Twice by Nadiya Hussain is out now</em></p> <h2>Omid Djalili</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Make sure the first thing you say on stage is funny\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>When I met successful and respected standup comedian Norm Macdonald at the Montreal comedy festival in 2015, I asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s the secret of good comedy?\u201d He said, \u201cThe trick is to make sure the first thing you say on stage is funny. And then make sure the second thing you say is funny and then the third thing you say is funny\u2026 \u201d and then he got called on to stage and I didn\u2019t see him again. Two years later, I bumped into him at LA airport and before I even had the chance to say hello he said, \u201cand then the fourth thing you say\u2026\u201d You can\u2019t argue with that.<br><em>See Omid Djalili in Namaste on tour throughout the UK</em></p> <h2>Dame Sheila Hancock</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Tomorrow is another day\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Generally, I\u2019ve loathed slogans to live by. As a child, I was told \u201cLittle girls should be seen and not heard,\u201d and \u201cKnow your place.\u201d It took me 70 years to defy those. Now, I quite fancy \u201cTomorrow is another day\u201d \u2013 Scarlett O\u2019Hara\u2019s last line in <em>Gone With the Wind</em>. It strikes a chord with me, with its multitude of meanings. I get a lot of pain from rheumatoid arthritis. A bad day can feel insurmountable, believing I\u2019ll be crawling on my knees eternally. A day later, I\u2019m absolutely fine. Similarly, a sleepless night fretting over the most worrying problems is soon forgotten. Whatever is plaguing you, the awful times won\u2019t last forever. It also means being open to change: anything can be done differently tomorrow in life\u2019s long adventure. And quite honestly, aged 91, I\u2019ll be grateful if any tomorrows at all still lie ahead of me.</p> <h2>Sir Mo Farah</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Be willing to adapt\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cBe willing to adapt.\u201d It\u2019s something my mum has said to me since I was a kid back home in Somalia. For years afterwards, I didn\u2019t understand what she\u2019d meant. As I got older, it made so much sense to me. Be open to new cultures, new languages, new ideas \u2013 not just what you already know. Don\u2019t expect everything to stay the same. Whatever environment you\u2019re thrown into, don\u2019t judge; be open-minded. Without that outlook, all I\u2019ve achieved would have been impossible. Arriving in England, I see now, it allowed me to make friends and connections and build a life in a place that at first was unfamiliar. And certainly it helped me in my career: every race is different, so work with what\u2019s in front of you. It\u2019s what I tell young people today: there\u2019s so much you can achieve, if you\u2019re open to it.</p> <h2>Dame Mary Beard</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You don\u2019t have to be boring\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>That was the advice given to me by an older colleague, the maverick Roman historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/mar/29/guardianobituaries.highereducation\">Keith Hopkins</a>, after I had given him the draft of one of my early academic articles. To discuss it, he took me to lunch at the Pizza Express near the British Museum and when we got to, I confess, the second bottle of wine, we turned to my article. The argument was fine, he said, but it was (imagine the hesitation here) a bit <em>boring</em>. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be boring, Mary.\u201d It wasn\u2019t what I wanted to hear, and it must have taken some courage (Dutch and other) for him to say it. But it was the best advice. Ever since I have tried only to be boring when absolutely necessary.</p> <h2>Russell T Davies</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hold the line\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The greatest advice I was ever given \u2013 apart from \u201cDon\u2019t buy a cheap ironing board\u201d \u2013 is simply \u201cHold the line.\u201d My friend and colleague Julie Gardner first said it to me 23 years ago when we embarked on a production of <em>Casanova</em>, which everyone turned down. \u201cHold the line,\u201d she\u2019d say. And that\u2019s how she got the show made, by never giving up. Now, every time I could collapse or compromise or rage and weep and despair, I mutter \u201cHold the line.\u201d Julie and I once sat in the BBC canteen at 9.30pm with a programme in tatters. We\u2019d been dealt blow after blow, no budget, no cast, no support, no hope. But we sat there, we laughed, we had cold curry \u2013 and we held the line. And we got it made.</p> <h2>John Lithgow</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Never be afraid to say no\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>I\u2019m acting on stage these days with a wonderful young actor named Tessa Bonham Jones. She recently sought out career advice from Lindsay Duncan, a great London actor twice her age. To Tessa, Lindsay\u2019s best counsel was concise: \u201cNever be afraid to say no.\u201d When Tessa quoted Lindsay\u2019s wise words to me, I was startled to realise I\u2019d received them about 60 years too late. Actors like me are congenitally afraid to say no, which accounts for the fact that half the acting jobs I\u2019ve ever done were ghastly mistakes.</p> <h2>Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Have a big crazy dream\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>As a child I was not considered bright. Undiagnosed dyslexia made the fundamental building blocks of reading and writing quite hard for me. I\u2019d come home disheartened after another failure at school. But dad would say, \u201cHave a big crazy dream, Maggie. It may take you longer and you might not get there, but if you love it, you will have great fun along the way.\u201d I\u2019ve had many crazy dreams in my life, but the strongest has been the desire to get out there into space. And my father was right, it is amazing fun pursuing that dream, whether I make it or not.</p> <h2>Lemn Sissay</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Take it easy, but take it all\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>I was 17 and had been given a two-day release from Wood End Assessment Centre in Atherton for a trip to Manchester. That night I was supporting a revolutionary band called African Dawn and I read my poems on stage. It was my first public reading. The next day the band and I visited the Workers Film Association, which was a derelict 9,000 sq ft Edwardian warehouse rebuilt by the workers on the borders of Hulme, Old Trafford and Moss Side. Wowo Wauters was the founder and a pretty hardcore Maoist. When we left, Wowo waved and said: \u201cTake it easy.\u201d Then he tapped me on the shoulders and said with a glint in his eye, \u201cbut take it all.\u201d His words have always stuck with me, and I don\u2019t know why.</p> <h2>Stephen King</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Do kill your darlings\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>At high school, I got a job writing sports stories for a weekly paper called <em>The Enterprise. </em>The editor was John Gould. As well as being the boss of <em>The Enterprise</em>, he wrote dozens \u2013 maybe hundreds \u2013 of witty essays. He looked at my first column, on a local hoopster who had broken the Lisbon Falls High scoring record, and quickly cut it down to size. Fastest lineouts I ever saw. He said: \u201cSteve, I want you to cut at least 100 words for every 400 you write.\u201d I never managed that, but when I cut my short stories down, I began to sell them. So yes, do kill your darlings.<br><em>You Like It Darker is out now</em></p> <h2>Funmi Fetto</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Don\u2019t be afraid to ask\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Bobbi Brown recently told me: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to ask.\u201d Historically, women in particular have been made to feel ashamed or are punished in some way when it comes to asking to have their needs or wants met \u2013 be it money or desires. Hence, many of us have been muted or have simply taken the idea of independence to such an extreme that it becomes detrimental. As women, we really need to push past this societal stronghold and be much more unapologetic about what we need and/or want. Let\u2019s dare to ask.</p> <h2>Mary Portas</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Try to love the questions themselves \u2026\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>From a teenager, I believed controlling all aspects of my life was where safety and security lay. I lost both my parents by 19, my mother from meningitis. Why didn\u2019t we act sooner? Why weren\u2019t we more questioning of the doctor? Those angst-ridden possibilities stayed with me. From then on, being in control \u2013 personally, professionally \u2013 felt a necessity. It was bloody exhausting. Five years ago, while going through a difficult time, I picked up a book of poetry by Rainer Maria Rilke: \u201cBe patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves\u2026 Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them.\u201d It fundamentally shifted how I look at the world. Embracing the flux and uncertainty of life is living. There is no one answer; no right or wrong. The point is to live everything. The pain, the uncertainty, the letting life happen. It was the most important release in my life.</p> <h2>Blake Morrison</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What is this life if, full of care/We have no time to stand and stare?\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>My father had strict instructions about social etiquette: firm handshake; look people in the eye; work hard and play hard. But it\u2019s my mother\u2019s philosophy, based on a poem by WH Davies, that has stuck with me: \u201cWhat is this life if, full of care/We have no time to stand and stare?\u201d By nature I\u2019m impatient and need to be <em>doing </em>stuff. But Mum (or Davies) was right. To be receptive to the world and the people in it, you have to slow down, look, listen, open yourself up. You don\u2019t even need to stand. Just sitting and gazing will do.</p> <h2>Chioma Nnadi</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Don\u2019t expect to change someone when they show you who they are from the very start\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>My parents generally know better than to meddle in my romantic life, but on the rare occasion that they have inserted themselves, they\u2019ve usually been right. On meeting my first American boyfriend, a scruffy non-committal skater from Brooklyn, my mum offered up an observation that was swift and incisive. \u201cHe\u2019s like a glass of champagne,\u201d she said. \u201cGreat fun for one night, but you\u2019ll have a hangover in the morning.\u201d It wasn\u2019t advice exactly \u2013 she knew I wouldn\u2019t want it from her \u2013 but it was her way of gently letting me know what I was letting myself in for. In other words, don\u2019t expect that you can change someone when they show you who they are from the very start. (Of course, it was a lesson I ended up having to learn the hard way.) As much as I\u2019d have hated to admit it back then, sometimes the best advice is unsolicited.</p> <h2>Michael Rosen</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hands behind, nose over toes\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>When I came out of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/30/michael-rosen-on-his-covid-19-coma-it-felt-like-a-pre-death-a-nothingness\">40-day induced coma in June 2020</a>, I couldn\u2019t stand up and I couldn\u2019t walk. Physiotherapists and occupational therapists at St Pancras Rehabilitation Unit got cracking on me. To teach me how to stand up from a sitting position, they had a little mantra they gave me: \u201cHands behind, nose over toes.\u201d It\u2019s brilliant. It swings your centre of gravity over your thighs and you push yourself forwards and up with your hands. Every day, I repeat the mantra maybe 20 or 30 times. I guess people younger than me don\u2019t need it, but I\u2019m 78 so with that in my mind, I\u2019m not one of those people who thinks getting out of a chair is like climbing Everest.</p> <h2>Jay Rayner</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unending happiness is a chimera\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>My mother, Claire Rayner, made her name and her living from advice, doled out in response to the thousand or so letters received each week in response to her problem pages in the <em>Sun</em>, <em>Sunday Mirror</em> and elsewhere. Sexual confusion and dysfunction, emotional distress and embarrassing ailments: all this and so much more flowed like a river through my childhood home. Only one piece of Claire\u2019s advice, given to me when I was an angst-ridden teen, stuck with me because it hung like a canopy as an answer to all other problems. Unending happiness, she said, was a chimera. Therefore, we should aim only for contentment. And if bubbles of happiness happened along, well, that should be taken as a bonus. She was a wise old bird, that one.</p> <h2>Jo Brand</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Wear what you like\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>I once appeared on a show called <em>What Not To Wear</em> with Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine, and they told me I \u201clooked like a man\u201d and needed to wear something \u201cmore feminine\u201d that wasn\u2019t black. I caved and allowed myself to be dressed for the Baftas like an elderly matron in a brown evening combo, with my cleavage out. I felt enormously uncomfortable. According to them, however, I looked \u201cmuch better\u201d. I didn\u2019t follow their advice after that. So here\u2019s mine: wear what you like. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s good advice, especially as the next and only other time I went to the Baftas, I chose my own outfit, which was charmingly described by one of the tabloids as \u201cbillowing\u201d. Then again, I\u2019ve always wanted to look like the lead galleon in the Spanish Armada.</p> <h2>Ravinder Bhogal</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Keep yourself rare\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>I was lucky enough to have crossed paths with the late, great Reg Gadney. Painter, novelist, screenwriter, polymath\u2026 They just don\u2019t make them like Reg any more. He painted me at his home in Fitzroy Square about 10 years ago. He disarmed me with a stream of witty quips and pearls of wisdom. One was a gem: \u201cKeep yourself rare.\u201d In our age of punishing schedules and FOMO, I\u2019ve discovered that \u201cNo, thank you\u201d is a complete answer. I used to say yes to everything. It left me exhausted, overwhelmed and less focused. Instead, I now revel in relinquishing high heels, Spanx, blow dries and parties for long, idle hours where I can read a book, eat chocolate and administer liberal doses of self-love.</p> <h2>Kate Garraway</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Break it up into bite-sized pieces\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cBreak it up into bite-sized pieces.\u201d When I started as a reporter, a friend taught me that when you\u2019re tackling any problem and feel you\u2019re sinking under its weight, think of a ship with its watertight compartments which prevent it from going under. Shutting them allows the rest of the ship to stay afloat. This helped me break down and construct my reporting, but also helped in everyday life. When I feel overwhelmed, I think of each day as its own \u201cwatertight compartment\u201d. Life throws you challenges: emotional ones, work, health, like our family has experienced over the past four years. When it feels too much, I think: \u201cWhat is the most vital piece for today?\u201d Completing that then becomes its own achievement. It helps make me feel that I\u2019m not overwhelmed, and to take \u2013 and enjoy \u2013 every moment as it comes.<br><em>Join Kate Garraway weekdays at 10am on Smooth Radio</em></p> <h2>Andrew Marr</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You\u2019ve only got one stomach\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>My father, Donald, was hugely influential on me. Moderation and humility was his agenda. Whenever I\u2019d talk about salaries and doing better, he\u2019d give me a long look and say: \u201cYou\u2019ve only got one stomach.\u201d He\u2019d encourage me to turn down high-paying jobs if they didn\u2019t feel right. The correct amount of money to have, he\u2019d assure me, is that which causes you to think least about it. And if ever I was getting above myself in my career, which may have happened, he\u2019d drop in a deep Scots accent: \u201cThere\u2019s a cure for everything, except a swelled head.\u201d He died a few years ago, but I still hear his voice all the time.<br><em>Tonight with Andrew Marr is on LBC at 6pm, Monday to Thursday</em></p> <h2>Nigel Slater</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You can grow old, but please don\u2019t ever grow up\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>One day, a decade or more ago, I had been laughing about the aches and pains of \u201cgrowing older\u201d. My best friend and business partner, James Thompson, said: \u201cYou can grow old, but please don\u2019t ever grow up.\u201d To this day, I haven\u2019t. I like to think I still have the same curiosity, energy and childish sense of humour I had as a teenager. And what is more, I have no intention of ever \u201cgrowing up\u201d. I rarely think of myself as too old to do anything I want to or to take anything, including myself, too seriously. It is a piece of advice I hope to take to my grave.</p> <h2>Eva Wiseman</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Look around \u2026 this is not the same as then, it\u2019s all new, it\u2019s going to be OK\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>For a long time I found Nora Ephron\u2019s famous advice, \u201cGo, right this minute, put on a bikini, and don\u2019t take it off until you\u2019re 34\u201d, liberating and lovely and affirming. Then I turned 34 and thought, Oh. It\u2019s tricky, shedding decades of the pressure and pain that link femininity to feeling bad about yourself, but week by week I get a little better at not wasting time, cash or energy on worrying about my appearance. I guess she helped kick that off. The other important bit of advice I received was from a midwife called Deborah, when I was struggling in labour with my second child after having had a traumatic birth with my first. She said: \u201cLook around \u2013 this is a different room, different windows, different people, this is not the same as then, it\u2019s all new, it\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d And then I pushed again and the baby came.</p> <h2>Chris Packham</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Shout above the noise\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>In 1979, I was confused, riven with self-loathing and very, very angry. I wanted to tear myself or the world up and start over again. And then, in a sweaty crowd of fellow punk rockers at a Penetration gig in Portsmouth, the wonderful Pauline Murray gave me an alternative: an answer and reason to go on, a direct instruction. From the stage, she said: \u201cWhen everything around you falls. And all the walls are closing in\u2026 You must exercise your strength of will. Don\u2019t let them win\u2026 Shout above the noise.\u201d I stood there and thought, well, that\u2019s it then, I\u2019d better get on with it. Has it made my life easy? No. It hasn\u2019t quelled the anger or self-doubt, either. But I don\u2019t care, I\u2019ll be shouting above the noise until my dying breath.</p> <h2>Sir Paul Smith</h2>    <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Keep your feet on the ground\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cKeep your feet on the ground.\u201d My wife, Pauline, has always helped me stay positive and humble. We\u2019ve been together since I was 21 and we\u2019ve always had a nice home life, so I have never been drawn in by the superficial side of the fashion business. We\u2019re on the earth for such a short time that health, love and friendship are paramount; it\u2019s about getting up in the morning, loving life and being optimistic.</p> <p><em>\u2022 All images courtesy of Getty, Alamy, Shutterstock, Dave Bennet and Wire images</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Good advice respects the recipient\u2019s autonomy, offering insights without taking away their sense of agency. It is rooted in empathy, aiming to uplift and empower, rather than control. It aims to provide clarity and direction while encouraging self-reflection, allowing the person to find their own answers. Most importantly, good advice is given at the right time, when the recipient is open and ready to hear it. On point, well-timed advice is one thing, but not all advice is wanted. Unwelcome advice is a common problem, especially in the age of social media, where everyone feels free to offer their opinions without being asked. This kind can feel patronising. It often implies that the person receiving advice is not capable of handling their own challenges. While unwanted advice can feel intrusive, navigating how to receive it can be just as challenging. One strategy is to recognise that advice often reflects the experiences and perspectives of the person giving it. It may say more about their worldview than it does about you. If you still feel defensive, ask yourself why. Resistance can sometimes mask a fear of vulnerability. For example, do you need to see yourself as someone who already has all the answers? Feeling as though you should already know something can evoke shame, making it hard to accept guidance. Socrates emphasised the value of humility and openness in learning. He believed that embracing our ignorance is the first step towards wisdom \u2013 advice I\u2019m taking on. Ultimately, the best advice, whether given or received, opens up new perspectives and helps us grow. Philippa Perry Joan Armatrading Never be afraid to pursue what you truly want\u201d The best advice I ever received came from my grandmother, via my mother: \u201cNever be afraid to pursue what you truly want.\u201d These words have stayed with me all my life. I didn\u2019t have a background in music. My father showed me how to tune the guitar then left me to it, after my mother swapped two old prams to buy the instrument. Everything else, I taught myself: songwriting, performing, producing, engineering and more. Being afraid to try anything new can hold you back: I debuted my first symphony last year. My grandmother\u2019s simple yet powerful message reminds me to always follow my own path. How Did This Happen and What Does It Now Mean? is out on 22 November on BMG Sir Michael Caine Champions and stars don\u2019t wallow in misfortune, they get up and get on with it\u201d I came up with this nugget myself. \u201cGet on with it\u201d works for everything in life: apply for a job, apply for a course, get in shape, learn a skill, ask a successful person for advice and mentoring. Keep moving and trying new things. I treated myself as a one-man studio, a one-man operation, determined to do the work I wanted to by hook or by crook. Have the patience to wait for the breakthrough and don\u2019t expect it to come about in a predictable way. I was just about the last of my gang of actors to become famous. Don\u2019t Look Back, You\u2019ll Trip Over: My Guide to Life by Michael Caine is out now Nadiya Hussain Anger is often more harmful than the injury that caused it\u201d My Year 8 teacher told us this, following endless class arguments. He sadly passed away that year, but the advice stuck with me. I was an angry child: dismissive and pessimistic. He made me realise how destructive this can be, making situations worse and distracting from the problem that needs solving. I\u2019m learning to be better at holding that anger back, taming it and returning to it with understanding. Cook Once, Eat Twice by Nadiya Hussain is out now Omid Djalili Make sure the first thing you say on stage is funny\u201d When I met successful and respected standup comedian Norm Macdonald at the Montreal comedy festival in 2015, I asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s the secret of good comedy?\u201d He said, \u201cThe trick is to make sure the first thing you say on stage is funny. And then make sure the second thing you say is funny and then the third thing you say is funny\u2026 \u201d and then he got called on to stage and I didn\u2019t see him again. Two years later, I bumped into him at LA airport and before I even had the chance to say hello he said, \u201cand then the fourth thing you say\u2026\u201d You can\u2019t argue with that. See Omid Djalili in Namaste on tour throughout the UK Dame Sheila Hancock Tomorrow is another day\u201d Generally, I\u2019ve loathed slogans to live by. As a child, I was told \u201cLittle girls should be seen and not heard,\u201d and \u201cKnow your place.\u201d It took me 70 years to defy those. Now, I quite fancy \u201cTomorrow is another day\u201d \u2013 Scarlett O\u2019Hara\u2019s last line in Gone With the Wind. It strikes a chord with me, with its multitude of meanings. I get a lot of pain from rheumatoid arthritis. A bad day can feel insurmountable, believing I\u2019ll be crawling on my knees eternally. A day later, I\u2019m absolutely fine. Similarly, a sleepless night fretting over the most worrying problems is soon forgotten. Whatever is plaguing you, the awful times won\u2019t last forever. It also means being open to change: anything can be done differently tomorrow in life\u2019s long adventure. And quite honestly, aged 91, I\u2019ll be grateful if any tomorrows at all still lie ahead of me. Sir Mo Farah Be willing to adapt\u201d \u201cBe willing to adapt.\u201d It\u2019s something my mum has said to me since I was a kid back home in Somalia. For years afterwards, I didn\u2019t understand what she\u2019d meant. As I got older, it made so much sense to me. Be open to new cultures, new languages, new ideas \u2013 not just what you already know. Don\u2019t expect everything to stay the same. Whatever environment you\u2019re thrown into, don\u2019t judge; be open-minded. Without that outlook, all I\u2019ve achieved would have been impossible. Arriving in England, I see now, it allowed me to make friends and connections and build a life in a place that at first was unfamiliar. And certainly it helped me in my career: every race is different, so work with what\u2019s in front of you. It\u2019s what I tell young people today: there\u2019s so much you can achieve, if you\u2019re open to it. Dame Mary Beard You don\u2019t have to be boring\u201d That was the advice given to me by an older colleague, the maverick Roman historian Keith Hopkins, after I had given him the draft of one of my early academic articles. To discuss it, he took me to lunch at the Pizza Express near the British Museum and when we got to, I confess, the second bottle of wine, we turned to my article. The argument was fine, he said, but it was (imagine the hesitation here) a bit boring. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be boring, Mary.\u201d It wasn\u2019t what I wanted to hear, and it must have taken some courage (Dutch and other) for him to say it. But it was the best advice. Ever since I have tried only to be boring when absolutely necessary. Russell T Davies Hold the line\u201d The greatest advice I was ever given \u2013 apart from \u201cDon\u2019t buy a cheap ironing board\u201d \u2013 is simply \u201cHold the line.\u201d My friend and colleague Julie Gardner first said it to me 23 years ago when we embarked on a production of Casanova, which everyone turned down. \u201cHold the line,\u201d she\u2019d say. And that\u2019s how she got the show made, by never giving up. Now, every time I could collapse or compromise or rage and weep and despair, I mutter \u201cHold the line.\u201d Julie and I once sat in the BBC canteen at 9.30pm with a programme in tatters. We\u2019d been dealt blow after blow, no budget, no cast, no support, no hope. But we sat there, we laughed, we had cold curry \u2013 and we held the line. And we got it made. John Lithgow Never be afraid to say no\u201d I\u2019m acting on stage these days with a wonderful young actor named Tessa Bonham Jones. She recently sought out career advice from Lindsay Duncan, a great London actor twice her age. To Tessa, Lindsay\u2019s best counsel was concise: \u201cNever be afraid to say no.\u201d When Tessa quoted Lindsay\u2019s wise words to me, I was startled to realise I\u2019d received them about 60 years too late. Actors like me are congenitally afraid to say no, which accounts for the fact that half the acting jobs I\u2019ve ever done were ghastly mistakes. Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock Have a big crazy dream\u201d As a child I was not considered bright. Undiagnosed dyslexia made the fundamental building blocks of reading and writing quite hard for me. I\u2019d come home disheartened after another failure at school. But dad would say, \u201cHave a big crazy dream, Maggie. It may take you longer and you might not get there, but if you love it, you will have great fun along the way.\u201d I\u2019ve had many crazy dreams in my life, but the strongest has been the desire to get out there into space. And my father was right, it is amazing fun pursuing that dream, whether I make it or not. Lemn Sissay Take it easy, but take it all\u201d I was 17 and had been given a two-day release from Wood End Assessment Centre in Atherton for a trip to Manchester. That night I was supporting a revolutionary band called African Dawn and I read my poems on stage. It was my first public reading. The next day the band and I visited the Workers Film Association, which was a derelict 9,000 sq ft Edwardian warehouse rebuilt by the workers on the borders of Hulme, Old Trafford and Moss Side. Wowo Wauters was the founder and a pretty hardcore Maoist. When we left, Wowo waved and said: \u201cTake it easy.\u201d Then he tapped me on the shoulders and said with a glint in his eye, \u201cbut take it all.\u201d His words have always stuck with me, and I don\u2019t know why. Stephen King Do kill your darlings\u201d At high school, I got a job writing sports stories for a weekly paper called The Enterprise. The editor was John Gould. As well as being the boss of The Enterprise, he wrote dozens \u2013 maybe hundreds \u2013 of witty essays. He looked at my first column, on a local hoopster who had broken the Lisbon Falls High scoring record, and quickly cut it down to size. Fastest lineouts I ever saw. He said: \u201cSteve, I want you to cut at least 100 words for every 400 you write.\u201d I never managed that, but when I cut my short stories down, I began to sell them. So yes, do kill your darlings. You Like It Darker is out now Funmi Fetto Don\u2019t be afraid to ask\u201d Bobbi Brown recently told me: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to ask.\u201d Historically, women in particular have been made to feel ashamed or are punished in some way when it comes to asking to have their needs or wants met \u2013 be it money or desires. Hence, many of us have been muted or have simply taken the idea of independence to such an extreme that it becomes detrimental. As women, we really need to push past this societal stronghold and be much more unapologetic about what we need and/or want. Let\u2019s dare to ask. Mary Portas Try to love the questions themselves \u2026\u201d From a teenager, I believed controlling all aspects of my life was where safety and security lay. I lost both my parents by 19, my mother from meningitis. Why didn\u2019t we act sooner? Why weren\u2019t we more questioning of the doctor? Those angst-ridden possibilities stayed with me. From then on, being in control \u2013 personally, professionally \u2013 felt a necessity. It was bloody exhausting. Five years ago, while going through a difficult time, I picked up a book of poetry by Rainer Maria Rilke: \u201cBe patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves\u2026 Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them.\u201d It fundamentally shifted how I look at the world. Embracing the flux and uncertainty of life is living. There is no one answer; no right or wrong. The point is to live everything. The pain, the uncertainty, the letting life happen. It was the most important release in my life. Blake Morrison What is this life if, full of care/We have no time to stand and stare?\u201d My father had strict instructions about social etiquette: firm handshake; look people in the eye; work hard and play hard. But it\u2019s my mother\u2019s philosophy, based on a poem by WH Davies, that has stuck with me: \u201cWhat is this life if, full of care/We have no time to stand and stare?\u201d By nature I\u2019m impatient and need to be doing stuff. But Mum (or Davies) was right. To be receptive to the world and the people in it, you have to slow down, look, listen, open yourself up. You don\u2019t even need to stand. Just sitting and gazing will do. Chioma Nnadi Don\u2019t expect to change someone when they show you who they are from the very start\u201d My parents generally know better than to meddle in my romantic life, but on the rare occasion that they have inserted themselves, they\u2019ve usually been right. On meeting my first American boyfriend, a scruffy non-committal skater from Brooklyn, my mum offered up an observation that was swift and incisive. \u201cHe\u2019s like a glass of champagne,\u201d she said. \u201cGreat fun for one night, but you\u2019ll have a hangover in the morning.\u201d It wasn\u2019t advice exactly \u2013 she knew I wouldn\u2019t want it from her \u2013 but it was her way of gently letting me know what I was letting myself in for. In other words, don\u2019t expect that you can change someone when they show you who they are from the very start. (Of course, it was a lesson I ended up having to learn the hard way.) As much as I\u2019d have hated to admit it back then, sometimes the best advice is unsolicited. Michael Rosen Hands behind, nose over toes\u201d When I came out of the 40-day induced coma in June 2020, I couldn\u2019t stand up and I couldn\u2019t walk. Physiotherapists and occupational therapists at St Pancras Rehabilitation Unit got cracking on me. To teach me how to stand up from a sitting position, they had a little mantra they gave me: \u201cHands behind, nose over toes.\u201d It\u2019s brilliant. It swings your centre of gravity over your thighs and you push yourself forwards and up with your hands. Every day, I repeat the mantra maybe 20 or 30 times. I guess people younger than me don\u2019t need it, but I\u2019m 78 so with that in my mind, I\u2019m not one of those people who thinks getting out of a chair is like climbing Everest. Jay Rayner Unending happiness is a chimera\u201d My mother, Claire Rayner, made her name and her living from advice, doled out in response to the thousand or so letters received each week in response to her problem pages in the Sun, Sunday Mirror and elsewhere. Sexual confusion and dysfunction, emotional distress and embarrassing ailments: all this and so much more flowed like a river through my childhood home. Only one piece of Claire\u2019s advice, given to me when I was an angst-ridden teen, stuck with me because it hung like a canopy as an answer to all other problems. Unending happiness, she said, was a chimera. Therefore, we should aim only for contentment. And if bubbles of happiness happened along, well, that should be taken as a bonus. She was a wise old bird, that one. Jo Brand Wear what you like\u201d I once appeared on a show called What Not To Wear with Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine, and they told me I \u201clooked like a man\u201d and needed to wear something \u201cmore feminine\u201d that wasn\u2019t black. I caved and allowed myself to be dressed for the Baftas like an elderly matron in a brown evening combo, with my cleavage out. I felt enormously uncomfortable. According to them, however, I looked \u201cmuch better\u201d. I didn\u2019t follow their advice after that. So here\u2019s mine: wear what you like. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s good advice, especially as the next and only other time I went to the Baftas, I chose my own outfit, which was charmingly described by one of the tabloids as \u201cbillowing\u201d. Then again, I\u2019ve always wanted to look like the lead galleon in the Spanish Armada. Ravinder Bhogal Keep yourself rare\u201d I was lucky enough to have crossed paths with the late, great Reg Gadney. Painter, novelist, screenwriter, polymath\u2026 They just don\u2019t make them like Reg any more. He painted me at his home in Fitzroy Square about 10 years ago. He disarmed me with a stream of witty quips and pearls of wisdom. One was a gem: \u201cKeep yourself rare.\u201d In our age of punishing schedules and FOMO, I\u2019ve discovered that \u201cNo, thank you\u201d is a complete answer. I used to say yes to everything. It left me exhausted, overwhelmed and less focused. Instead, I now revel in relinquishing high heels, Spanx, blow dries and parties for long, idle hours where I can read a book, eat chocolate and administer liberal doses of self-love. Kate Garraway Break it up into bite-sized pieces\u201d \u201cBreak it up into bite-sized pieces.\u201d When I started as a reporter, a friend taught me that when you\u2019re tackling any problem and feel you\u2019re sinking under its weight, think of a ship with its watertight compartments which prevent it from going under.

Whenever I\u2019d talk about salaries and doing better, he\u2019d give me a long look and say: \u201cYou\u2019ve only got one stomach.\u201d He\u2019d encourage me to turn down high-paying jobs if they didn\u2019t feel right. The correct amount of money to have, he\u2019d assure me, is that which causes you to think least about it. And if ever I was getting above myself in my career, which may have happened, he\u2019d drop in a deep Scots accent: \u201cThere\u2019s a cure for everything, except a swelled head.\u201d He died a few years ago, but I still hear his voice all the time. Tonight with Andrew Marr is on LBC at 6pm, Monday to Thursday Nigel Slater You can grow old, but please don\u2019t ever grow up\u201d One day, a decade or more ago, I had been laughing about the aches and pains of \u201cgrowing older\u201d. My best friend and business partner, James Thompson, said: \u201cYou can grow old, but please don\u2019t ever grow up.\u201d To this day, I haven\u2019t. I like to think I still have the same curiosity, energy and childish sense of humour I had as a teenager. And what is more, I have no intention of ever \u201cgrowing up\u201d. I rarely think of myself as too old to do anything I want to or to take anything, including myself, too seriously. It is a piece of advice I hope to take to my grave. Eva Wiseman Look around \u2026 this is not the same as then, it\u2019s all new, it\u2019s going to be OK\u201d For a long time I found Nora Ephron\u2019s famous advice, \u201cGo, right this minute, put on a bikini, and don\u2019t take it off until you\u2019re 34\u201d, liberating and lovely and affirming. Then I turned 34 and thought, Oh. It\u2019s tricky, shedding decades of the pressure and pain that link femininity to feeling bad about yourself, but week by week I get a little better at not wasting time, cash or energy on worrying about my appearance. I guess she helped kick that off. The other important bit of advice I received was from a midwife called Deborah, when I was struggling in labour with my second child after having had a traumatic birth with my first. She said: \u201cLook around \u2013 this is a different room, different windows, different people, this is not the same as then, it\u2019s all new, it\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d And then I pushed again and the baby came. Chris Packham Shout above the noise\u201d In 1979, I was confused, riven with self-loathing and very, very angry. I wanted to tear myself or the world up and start over again. And then, in a sweaty crowd of fellow punk rockers at a Penetration gig in Portsmouth, the wonderful Pauline Murray gave me an alternative: an answer and reason to go on, a direct instruction. From the stage, she said: \u201cWhen everything around you falls. And all the walls are closing in\u2026 You must exercise your strength of will. Don\u2019t let them win\u2026 Shout above the noise.\u201d I stood there and thought, well, that\u2019s it then, I\u2019d better get on with it. Has it made my life easy? No. It hasn\u2019t quelled the anger or self-doubt, either. But I don\u2019t care, I\u2019ll be shouting above the noise until my dying breath. Sir Paul Smith Keep your feet on the ground\u201d \u201cKeep your feet on the ground.\u201d My wife, Pauline, has always helped me stay positive and humble. We\u2019ve been together since I was 21 and we\u2019ve always had a nice home life, so I have never been drawn in by the superficial side of the fashion business. We\u2019re on the earth for such a short time that health, love and friendship are paramount; it\u2019s about getting up in the morning, loving life and being optimistic. \u2022 All images courtesy of Getty, Alamy, Shutterstock, Dave Bennet and Wire images",

English undergraduate education is a hot mess that works in the institutional interests of universities, not young people.</p> <p>Yes, there are bastions of excellence. But, in expanding an elite system that served a small slice of society a few decades ago to cover about <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-49841620\">half of young people</a>, politicians have given far too little thought about how to do this in a way that serves students, not universities.</p> <p>The announcement by the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, that tuition fees will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/nov/04/university-fees-in-england-to-rise-next-autumn-for-first-time-in-eight-years\">increase from \u00a39,250 to \u00a39,535</a> is only the latest patch for a system that requires more fundamental reform.</p> <p>The cross-party political instinct to expand post-18 education and training to more young people has been the correct one. But it has been done badly. The costs of expansion have been shifted away from taxpayers towards graduates, and it has been achieved by lifting caps on student numbers so universities can effectively recruit as many undergraduates as they want, and bank the fee income. <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/student-finance-calculator\"> </a></p> <p>Under the current loans system, a graduate with median lifetime earnings who started in 2024 is forecast to repay \u00a345,600 over their lifetime, after interest and any loan write-off \u2013 a bit less than the \u00a352,300 that the typical graduate who started in 2022 under the previous system is forecast to repay. Those repayments essentially take the form of an extra 9p on the pound of income tax on all income above the repayment threshold, until the loan and accumulating interest is repaid, or written off.</p> <p>Phillipson\u2019s fee increase won\u2019t make much difference to the typical&nbsp;graduate, who will end up repaying a few hundred pounds more over their lifetime. Or to universities, which say it will result in just an extra \u00a318m year for the sector after accounting for the impact of the rise in employer national insurance announced in the budget. As patches go, it\u2019s on the incremental side. Labour now needs to turn its focus to the deeper&nbsp;problems.</p> <p>First, are the huge sums that many young people will end up repaying worth it? Universities point to data that suggests that, for graduates who went to university 20 years ago, there\u2019s an average lifetime graduate premium of <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/sites/default/files/output_url_files/R167-The-impact-of-undergraduate-degrees-on-lifetime-earnings.pdf\">\u00a3130,000 for women and \u00a3240,000 for men</a>. But that\u2019s just an average \u2013 even back then, three in 10 of those graduates earned less over their lifetime than non-graduates. Since then, that <a href=\"https://www.hesa.ac.uk/files/Return_to_a_degree_main_report.pdf\">graduate premium may well have declined</a>.</p> <p>Completely unanswered is the question of how much any increase in earnings comes from the fact that someone has a degree certificate \u2013 and there has been a qualifications arms race in the sense that there are jobs today that require degrees that 40 years ago did not \u2013 and how much from the skills they develop through their course.</p> <p>We have no idea what courses add in terms of real skills formation. There are no meaningful quality controls on degree courses, and, because universities award their own degrees, effectively marking their own homework, degree classification is not a reliable indictor. But we do know that almost a third of graduates <a href=\"https://www.niesr.ac.uk/blog/challenges-facing-higher-education-uk\">do not end up in graduate jobs</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>No one is looking out for the interests of young people in the face of an extraordinarily powerful university sector</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This all means that some of the most selective universities can just rest on the fact that they pick young people with the best A-level grades, who go on to the best-paid jobs, without ever accounting for the quality of what they provide in the intervening three years.</p> <p>And, as Iain Mansfield (@edrith) of Policy Exchange <a href=\"https://www.edrith.co.uk/p/how-did-england-fall-out-of-love\">has argued</a>, the incentives for less selective institutions are to get as many young people through the door to increase their fee income regardless of whether these courses are good for them. There will almost certainly be excellent courses across the sector, and also some very poor ones. With no independent arbiter of quality, we simply don\u2019t know.</p> <p>Second, how do we know whether universities are spending their income \u2013 the bulk of which is made up of the future earnings of young people \u2013 in an efficient way? Their per-student funding has&nbsp;yo-yoed: it jumped by about 50% when fees were tripled in 2012&nbsp;but inflation has now taken it back down to 2011 levels.</p> <p>Universities tell a hard-knock story of how their funding <a href=\"https://russellgroup.ac.uk/media/6145/university-business-model-explainer.pdf\">barely covers their costs</a>. But there is an extraordinary lack of transparency about <a href=\"https://wonkhe.com/blogs/universities-are-losing-the-argument-on-university-fees-and-funding/\">how this money is spent</a>. Fees from cheaper-to-provide courses will end up subsidising more expensive Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) courses, but to what tune? The fact that schools provide a more intensive form of education more cheaply per head than universities gets dismissively tossed aside but I\u2019ve never heard a convincing response since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/26/university-fees-regulator-tuition-students\">I first raised it</a> a few years ago.</p> <p>We\u2019ve created a system where we ask students to sign up to effectively pay tens of thousands of pounds of higher income tax than those 30 years older than them did, on a vague promise that \u201cit\u2019ll be worth it\u201d. There is every chance that they are paying for the privilege of being stratified by their A-level grades into a system that ends up doing more to cement than tackle socioeconomic disadvantage.</p> <p>No one is really looking out for the interests of young people in the face of an extraordinarily powerful university sector, with prominent defenders in parliament, that asserts that the undergraduate offer is consistently excellent against a backdrop of government incentives that encourage the watering down of quality.</p> <p>The genius PR move by those who defend the system has been to portray anyone questioning it as being anti-aspiration. But I would argue that it is pro-aspiration to ensure that young people are not being mis-sold poor-quality degrees and to ask&nbsp;tough questions about who, exactly, is holding universities accountable for how they today spend this generation\u2019s future earnings? That\u2019s the really hard question a Labour government needs to answer.</p> <p>\u2022 Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Phillipson\u2019s fee increase won\u2019t make much difference to the typical graduate, who will end up repaying a few hundred pounds more over their lifetime. Or to universities, which say it will result in just an extra \u00a318m year for the sector after accounting for the impact of the rise in employer national insurance announced in the budget. As patches go, it\u2019s on the incremental side. Labour now needs to turn its focus to the deeper problems. First, are the huge sums that many young people will end up repaying worth it? Universities point to data that suggests that, for graduates who went to university 20 years ago, there\u2019s an average lifetime graduate premium of \u00a3130,000 for women and \u00a3240,000 for men. But that\u2019s just an average \u2013 even back then, three in 10 of those graduates earned less over their lifetime than non-graduates. Since then, that graduate premium may well have declined. Completely unanswered is the question of how much any increase in earnings comes from the fact that someone has a degree certificate \u2013 and there has been a qualifications arms race in the sense that there are jobs today that require degrees that 40 years ago did not \u2013 and how much from the skills they develop through their course. We have no idea what courses add in terms of real skills formation. There are no meaningful quality controls on degree courses, and, because universities award their own degrees, effectively marking their own homework, degree classification is not a reliable indictor. But we do know that almost a third of graduates do not end up in graduate jobs. This all means that some of the most selective universities can just rest on the fact that they pick young people with the best A-level grades, who go on to the best-paid jobs, without ever accounting for the quality of what they provide in the intervening three years. And, as Iain Mansfield (@edrith) of Policy Exchange has argued, the incentives for less selective institutions are to get as many young people through the door to increase their fee income regardless of whether these courses are good for them. There will almost certainly be excellent courses across the sector, and also some very poor ones. With no independent arbiter of quality, we simply don\u2019t know. Second, how do we know whether universities are spending their income \u2013 the bulk of which is made up of the future earnings of young people \u2013 in an efficient way? Their per-student funding has yo-yoed: it jumped by about 50% when fees were tripled in 2012 but inflation has now taken it back down to 2011 levels. Universities tell a hard-knock story of how their funding barely covers their costs. But there is an extraordinary lack of transparency about how this money is spent. Fees from cheaper-to-provide courses will end up subsidising more expensive Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) courses, but to what tune? The fact that schools provide a more intensive form of education more cheaply per head than universities gets dismissively tossed aside but I\u2019ve never heard a convincing response since I first raised it a few years ago. We\u2019ve created a system where we ask students to sign up to effectively pay tens of thousands of pounds of higher income tax than those 30 years older than them did, on a vague promise that \u201cit\u2019ll be worth it\u201d. There is every chance that they are paying for the privilege of being stratified by their A-level grades into a system that ends up doing more to cement than tackle socioeconomic disadvantage. No one is really looking out for the interests of young people in the face of an extraordinarily powerful university sector, with prominent defenders in parliament, that asserts that the undergraduate offer is consistently excellent against a backdrop of government incentives that encourage the watering down of quality. The genius PR move by those who defend the system has been to portray anyone questioning it as being anti-aspiration. But I would argue that it is pro-aspiration to ensure that young people are not being mis-sold poor-quality degrees and to ask tough questions about who, exactly, is holding universities accountable for how they today spend this generation\u2019s future earnings? That\u2019s the really hard question a Labour government needs to answer. \u2022 Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Yet you can\u2019t call <em>Held</em> a multigenerational family saga, exactly \u2013 it\u2019s more a frame for reflections on war, science, art, love, care \u2013 and its satisfactions aren\u2019t those of old-school realism: it\u2019s very much the kind of novel where you need to be patient before finding out who \u201che\u201d and \u201cshe\u201d are, or whether what\u2019s being narrated is memory or something happening in the narrative present, and whose perspective it\u2019s from and so on \u2013 even as the chapter intertitles are contrastingly specific (\u201cRue Gazan, Paris, 1908\u201d).</p> <p>Sometimes, it\u2019s off-puttingly swoony, to be sure (it starts with the fragment reading: \u201cWe know life is finite.

Still, I suspect booksellers will be weeping into their packing crates if it wins.</p>    <p>Novels that tussle with morality and mortality were clearly a draw for this year\u2019s judges: another is <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/stone-yard-devotional-9781399724340/\">Stone Yard Devotional</a></strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/stone-yard-devotional-9781399724340/\"> </a>(Sceptre), the seventh novel by Australian writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/sep/17/booker-prize-charlotte-wood-australia-stone-yard-devotional#:~:text=Stone%20Yard%20Devotional%20is%20Wood's,of%20southern%20New%20South%20Wales.\">Charlotte Wood</a>, who came to attention in the UK with <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/14/the-weekend-by-charlotte-wood-review-intimate-and-insightful\">The Weekend</a></em> (2019), about septuagenarian women who gather to clear the house of a dead friend (one of this year\u2019s panel, Sara Collins, was among many admiring reviewers).</p> <p><em>Stone Yard Devotional</em> takes the form of a private diary (\u201cNobody will read this but me\u201d) written by a middle-aged woman who leaves her job and marriage during the pandemic to join a monastery amid an unprecedented drought that brings about a mouse plague.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>More than the rest, Creation Lake challenges you to figure out what to think and where to stand</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It details the narrator\u2019s daily tasks, dominated by the increasingly grisly job of pest control, while she sifts memories of her own life or people she\u2019s known. These little vignettes are often casually devastating, whether they involve subjects such as suicide, euthanasia and murder, or merely drill down into her experience to gently but unflinchingly explore things she\u2019s never uttered aloud, such as her shame about having bullied a schoolmate, or her jealousy when a dead friend made time to meet others but not her during her final illness.</p> <p>The book\u2019s steady directness has a cumulative force. As in <em>The Weekend</em>, Wood is tender but non-maudlin on the stuff that meets us all \u2013 illness, bereavement \u2013 as well as the knotty matter of guilt: here, the lofty question of how to live well is most often simply the difficulty of not messing up. Winningly no-nonsense stuff, highly recommended to anyone in a reading slump and 100% prizeworthy.</p>    <p>A cloistered environment prompting reflection is also to be found in Samantha Harvey\u2019s fifth novel, <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/orbital-9781529922936/\">Orbital</a></strong> (Jonathan Cape), which takes place over 24 hours on the International Space Station, whose six-person crew experience 16 sunrises and 16 sunsets while circling Earth, remote from the turmoil of the planet and their lives.</p> <p>We see the banter among the crew, their individual thoughts and daily rhythms as they check and maintain systems - the ship\u2019s and their own. Their helpless view of a typhoon hitting the Philippines is the closest Harvey\u2019s joyous novel gets to threat or even much by way of a story. Instead the attraction, line after riveting line, is her capacity simply to imagine her way persuasively into every part of life on the ISS, in all its nuts-and-bolts littleness as well as all its soaring majesty.</p> <p>The book seems to make its own time \u2013 a sealed craft of its own for the reader, and one fuelled by an ever-present paradox, given that Harvey\u2019s astronauts contemplate the impossibility of describing their experiences to the earthbound, a gulf she herself persuasively leaps.<em>Orbital</em> would be a fine winner, too, albeit short not only on plot but also irony, to some minds a vital bit of spice in a novel.

We\u2019re in the south of France with a hard-drinking female ex-FBI agent turned honeytrapper-for-hire, infiltrating a radical French farming co-op that supposedly threatens big business interests. The story takes in the situationists, Nazis, Daft Punk and Michel Houellebecq, culminating in a tense assassination plot that tips satisfyingly into farce.</p>    <p>Like Everett\u2019s <em>James</em>, this is a full-spectrum satisfaction, albeit a slower one, as Kushner, previously shortlisted in 2018, unhurriedly lays the groundwork for a literary striptease by which the narrator herself gradually becomes the story. When it was published earlier this year, reviewers were wowed as well as contemptuous \u2013 the latter group, I suspect, because they confused the novel with its distinctly sketchy protagonist, who a) being a spy, and b) secretly off her face much of the time, can\u2019t exactly be trusted. Yet the novel\u2019s unreliability goes deeper still, thanks to the part played by a cave-dwelling guru espousing wild theories about the fate of Neanderthals.</p> <p>Of all the shortlisted novels, <em>Creation Lake</em> is the novel with the most slippery relationship to its own narrative truth. More than the rest, it challenges you to figure out what to think and where to stand, maintaining an amazingly stubborn poker face throughout, and it\u2019s more layered than <em>James</em>, the one other novel here that is most alive to the value of making the reader laugh. Ultimately, I suspect it\u2019s Everett\u2019s novel that is the book every judge will be happiest standing behind, but when the choice is so open, you may say that whoever wins the 2024 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booker-prize\">Booker prize</a>, it\u2019s a year in which readers did, too.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Explore the shortlist for this year\u2019s Booker prize and, for a limited time, get all six books for only \u00a370 at <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-booker-prize-2024?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">guardianbookshop.com</a>.

Either way, the 2024 panel, chaired by the artist and memoirist Edmund de Waal (The Hare With Amber Eyes), have whittled their tottering book stacks down to an excellent six-strong shortlist, five of which would make a worthy winner on Tuesday 12 November. The exception, for me, is The Safekeep (Viking), a twisty but basic debut from Israeli-born Dutch novelist Yael van der Wouden, who writes in English. Set in 1961, it\u2019s concerned with plundered Jewish property \u2013 the subject of de Waal\u2019s bestselling memoir \u2013 specifically the experience of Dutch Jews who survived the Holocaust, a subject the novel creeps up on slantwise with a plot involving same-sex lust. Its protagonist, Isabel, 27, lives alone in the country house her family occupied when she was a child in 1944. Her older brother assumes she\u2019ll marry herself off and leave, and is waiting to inherit the house. When he introduces her to his latest girlfriend, Eva, the instant tension between both women boils over after Isabel is left with no option but to share the house with Eva while her brother travels for work. The early pages are pungent with paranoid dread as Isabel obsessively monitors her late mother\u2019s possessions in case of theft, but the patient buildup of atmosphere is quickly spent once we guess what\u2019s driving each woman, and the end puts too tidy a lid on the history the book unearths \u2013 the story stops just as it really gets going. In a way, the same goes for the novel I\u2019d be least surprised to see win, James (Mantle) by US writer Percival Everett, who was previously shortlisted in 2022 for The Trees and whose satirical novel Erasure was the basis of the Oscar-winning 2023 film American Fiction. Set on the Mississippi, it\u2019s a high-velocity, picaresque retelling of Mark Twain\u2019s 1884 novel The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, this time narrated not by the titular runaway child but by his companion, Jim, fleeing his enslavement. Gone \u2013 or or at least, almost \u2013 is the phonetic speech Twain gave Jim, portrayed by Everett as a wry, philosophically literate reader who, like every other black character in the book, carefully adjusts his language around white people to ensure he lives down to expectations \u2013 a survival strategy that leads, as any Everett fan may guess, to no little comedy, even in the most appalling circumstances. As a between-the-lines study of a kind of willed ignorance of horror, James shares DNA with Small Things Like These and Jonathan Glazer\u2019s The Zone of Interest, but it\u2019s closer in tone to flight narratives such as A Little Life and Demon Copperhead. It culminates in a wish-fulfilling revenge fantasy, with climactic lines surely to be rousingly delivered in the Steven Spielberg-produced movie adaptation that is already in the works, although James always feels spikily sensitive to its own reception, quipping on the profitability of \u201cwhite guilt\u201d.

For something completely different, see the fragmentary novel Held (Bloomsbury) by the Canadian poet Anne Michaels, whose high-literary style requires the reader to meet it halfway: even the judges\u2019 praising citation explains that it \u201cmay seem forbidding\u201d at first. It follows a bloodline that zigzags through the 20th century, from a photographer wounded while fighting in France in 1917, to the son of a composer nabbed by secret police in Soviet Estonia. (there are also walk-on parts for Marie Curie and the physicist Ernest Rutherford).

Still, I suspect booksellers will be weeping into their packing crates if it wins. Novels that tussle with morality and mortality were clearly a draw for this year\u2019s judges: another is Stone Yard Devotional (Sceptre), the seventh novel by Australian writer Charlotte Wood, who came to attention in the UK with The Weekend (2019), about septuagenarian women who gather to clear the house of a dead friend (one of this year\u2019s panel, Sara Collins, was among many admiring reviewers). Stone Yard Devotional takes the form of a private diary (\u201cNobody will read this but me\u201d) written by a middle-aged woman who leaves her job and marriage during the pandemic to join a monastery amid an unprecedented drought that brings about a mouse plague. It details the narrator\u2019s daily tasks, dominated by the increasingly grisly job of pest control, while she sifts memories of her own life or people she\u2019s known. These little vignettes are often casually devastating, whether they involve subjects such as suicide, euthanasia and murder, or merely drill down into her experience to gently but unflinchingly explore things she\u2019s never uttered aloud, such as her shame about having bullied a schoolmate, or her jealousy when a dead friend made time to meet others but not her during her final illness.

      "bodyText": "Ukraine faces increasing difficulties in its fight against Moscow\u2019s invasion, the country\u2019s top military commander, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, said on Saturday, as Russian forces advance and North Korean troops prepare to join the Kremlin\u2019s campaign. Writing on Facebook, Syrskyi said he told the head of the US European command, Gen Christopher Cavoli: \u201cThe situation remains challenging and shows signs of escalation. The enemy, leveraging its numerical advantage, is continuing offensive actions and is focusing its main efforts on the Pokrovsk and Kurakhove directions.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s general staff, in a late evening report on Saturday, said 40 armed clashes had occurred around villages near Kurakhove. Both Ukrainian and Russian military bloggers on Friday said Russian forces sought to encircle the city. \u201cWe have numerous reports of North Korean soldiers preparing to participate in combat operations alongside Russian Forces,\u201d Syrskyi said. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has pledged \u201cunwavering\u201d support for Ukraine in Kyiv on Saturday. He said \u201cthe clear purpose\u201d of his visit to Ukraine is to \u201cexpress European Union support to Ukraine \u2013 this support remains unwavering\u201d. \u201cThis support is absolutely needed for you to continue defending yourself against Russia aggression.\u201d The Trump administration\u2019s priority in Ukraine would be establishing peace and not restoring lost territory, including Crimea, a senior aide to the US president-elect has said. Bryan Lanza, a longtime Republican party strategist, told the BBC that Donald Trump\u2019s administration would be asking the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, for a \u201crealistic vision for peace\u201d. \u201cAnd if President Zelenskyy comes to the table and says, \u2018well we can only have peace if we have Crimea\u2019, he shows to us that he\u2019s not serious. Crimea is gone,\u201d Lanza said. Trump\u2019s transition team has distanced the incoming president from Lanza. \u201cBryan Lanza was a contractor for the campaign,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cHe does not work for President Trump and does not speak for him.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, has said Kyiv is ready to work with the Trump administration. \u201cRemember that President Zelenskyy was one of the first world leaders \u2026 to greet President Trump,\u201d Sybiha told reporters. \u201cIt was a sincere conversation [and] an exchange of thoughts regarding further cooperation. Also during the telephone conversation, further steps to establish communication between teams were discussed and this work has also begun. Therefore, we are open for further cooperation and I\u2019m sure that a unified goal of reaching just peace unites all of us.\u201d The Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said Moscow and Washington were \u201cexchanging signals\u201d on Ukraine via \u201cclosed channels\u201d, without specifying whether the communication was with the current administration or Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration.

Sergei Ryabkov has said Russia\u2019s updated nuclear doctrine would make it possible \u201cto turn to the nuclear option\u201d if there was an acute crisis in relations with the west and the situation in Ukraine, Interfax reported. \u201cThis process will be finalised,\u201d Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister said. \u201cThe president of the Russian Federation as supreme commander-in-chief will undoubtedly make decisions that will mean the improvement of the conceptual foundations of our activities in this sphere.\u201d A possible agreement between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine poses \u201ca serious challenge for everyone\u201d, the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, has warned. \u201cThere is no doubt that this new political landscape is a serious challenge for everyone, especially in the context of a possible end to the Russian-Ukrainian war as a result of an agreement between, for example, the president of Russia and the new president of the United States,\u201d Tusk said as he prepared to meet with the Nato head, Mark Rutte, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the British prime minister, Keir Starmer.

Today in an article for the Observer online the MEP and former Italian government minister Sandro Gozi, recently elected as the new chair of the 70-strong UK-EU parliamentary partnership assembly (PPA), and the chair of the Labour Movement for Europe Stella Creasy MP say failure to reconstitute the PPA since the July general election is an issue that \u201curgently\u201d needs to be addressed.

A parliamentary source, while critical of the government\u2019s failure to appoint new MPs, suggested one reason for the delay was a request from the Conservatives to wait until the conclusion of their leadership election. Calls for the UK to work more closely with the EU on everything from foreign policy to defence and trade \u2013 as well as immigration \u2013 have been growing since Trump\u2019s stunning re-election success.

The Prince and Princess of Wales will join the king and senior politicians for the national service of remembrance at the Cenotaph to honour all those killed. The Remembrance Sunday silence marks the historic moment fighting in the first world war came to an end in 1918 at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month \u2013 six hours after the armistice was signed. Armistice Day itself is on Monday this year \u2013 11 November. About 10,000 veterans will march past the Cenotaph in Whitehall on Sunday, representing 326 different armed forces and civilian organisations for the Royal British Legion, the charity behind the annual Poppy Appeal. Thousands of people are expected to pay their respects at the remembrance event and participate in the two-minute silence, according to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). It is also the 80th anniversary of the D-day landings in the second world war this year, the 25th anniversary of the end of the war in Kosovo, the 75th anniversary of Nato and the 120th anniversary of the entente cordiale between the UK and France. More than 800 sailors, soldiers and aviators are expected to be on duty at the Cenotaph and at commemorative services at Westminster Abbey and Westminster Cathedral. The prime minister said the \u201ccourage and sacrifice of so many over the generations\u201d brings the country together \u201cin a spirit of the most profound gratitude and respect\u201d. Keir Starmer said: \u201cThis weekend, we come together to honour those who laid down their lives to keep our country safe. \u201cThe freedoms we enjoy today \u2013 our democracy, our values, our way of life \u2013 have been hard-won over generations. \u201cWe are forever in debt to those brave souls who fought to defend this country, and who made the ultimate sacrifice. \u201cWe honour them today and always.

Wines from \u00a326 a bottle</strong></p> <p>In one corner of the lengthy menu at Joseph\u2019s Brasserie, a lovely new Lebanese restaurant in London\u2019s Kensington, is a description which may give some people pause. It\u2019s listed under Signature Dishes and begins \u201cTender lamb intestines stuffed with a savoury mixture of rice\u2026\u201d The sweet word \u201ctender\u201d, used for kisses and caresses, has to do an awful lot of heavy lifting there, when it\u2019s shepherding the word \u201cintestines\u201d into view. It\u2019s just too duodenal, isn\u2019t it? Too redolent of lunch on the way out of the body as waste, rather than on the way in as pleasure.</p> <p>Ah, the curse of nouns. Of course, if you look up a picture of fweregh, the Lebanese name for the dish, what you get is a pleasingly gnarly sausage; a sibling to the haggis and a cousin to bangers the world over. You did know that\u2019s what sausages are made of, didn\u2019t you? Good. We didn\u2019t order it, as it happens: the fweregh weighs half a kilo, costs \u00a380, was not suitable for everyone at our table and would have dominated lunch. But it says something about the place: that if you know where to look or, better still, ask for guidance from the eponymous Joseph, you may well find a few Lebanese dishes cooked here by his father, Yazbek, that you haven\u2019t before encountered.</p>    <p>Other things, however, are familiar. Very familiar. At least to me. Only as I was striding down Kensington High Street did I clock that Joseph occupies the same location as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/dec/04/pascor-london-food-that-demands-you-have-a-good-time-restaurant-review\">Pascor</a>, a Middle Eastern-themed restaurant I reviewed just over 18 months ago, but which obviously has gone the way of too many other hospitality businesses. This, I realise, hands a loaded gun to those who complain about the geographic spread of these columns. He doesn\u2019t just review occasionally in the same London tube zone; sometimes he reviews in the same bloody square footage. On the one hand, guilty as charged; on the other, if I\u2019d been put off by that, we\u2019d all have missed out \u2013 or at least I would have.</p>    <p>Downstairs little has changed, save that fat spits of lamb and chicken shawarma now turn slowly behind the counter for their sandwich business. There are fryers for falafel and a grill for lamb kofta, skewers and the like. Smoke pirouettes upwards and the air smells like a narrow Middle Eastern street after dark, even in daylight. All of this is served with the flatbreads made from scratch, which are soft and pillowy on one side, and crisp and friable on the other. The upstairs dining room has, however, had a makeover. Now there are turquoise walls with gold edging, and hung on the walls are antique etchings, picked up in Portobello Market. On one side there are Victorian views of London, on the other equally venerable images of Lebanon, of grand ancient vistas and cypress trees punching the sky like insistent exclamation marks. I could perhaps have added the words \u201cin happier times\u201d to that description of Lebanon, but the tragic carnage and political chaos unfolding there is so obvious, it barely needs referencing in a restaurant review. For now, let\u2019s celebrate the food culture.</p>    <p>The menu is long and detailed and covers the usual. There are three takes on hummus, including hummus Beiruti, spiky with free chilli. There are stuffed vine leaves, platters of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/aug/23/nigel-slater-recipes-freekeh-with-summer-vegetables-and-labneh-with-sesame\">labneh</a> and the whacking chilli and red pepper fire of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/aug/28/how-to-turn-old-bell-peppers-into-muhummara-recipe-zero-waste-not\">muhammara</a>. There are kibbeh and cheese rolls. We have a deep, verdant bowl of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/jul/17/how-to-make-perfect-tabbouleh\">tabbouleh</a> to bring greenery to the table and another of moutabal, the soothing bash of roasted aubergine, which is the best kind of beige. In the middle is a well filled with grassy olive oil in which sparkle beads of pomegranate. It demands a sweeping through with torn wedges of the still hot bread. To the familiar we add the unfamiliar, soft folds of sliced lamb\u2019s tongue, saut\u00e9ed in lemon and garlic, a self-saucing dish which demands more bread. There are small, coarsely ground lamb sausages made on site with an edge of offal and a hit of chilli, and which come in a liquor that is sweet and sharp with pomegranate molasses. Now we have an extra use for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/16/thomasina-miers-recipe-for-mujadara-with-spiced-chicken-livers\">mdardara</a>, a nutty mix of rice and lentils, threaded with sweet, caramelised onions like toffee.</p>    <p>A mixed grill of lamb kofta and both lamb and chicken shish is solid enough, but it is completely overshadowed by another signature dish listed as Sultan Ibrahim. It brings four floured and seasoned red mullet, deep-fried until golden, so that the flesh pulls away from the bone. We find ourselves using our fingers to pick at the good stuff right up to the top of the head. Through the crust there are flashes of silver skin and they lie on a rustling mound of shredded flatbread that has also been deep-fried, then dusted with the purple of sumac. On the side is a bowl of sticky tahini sauce. It\u2019s the kind of dish you fantasise about eating at some restaurant on a corniche at the eastern end of the Med, with the smell of salt and seaweed in your nostrils, as a blisteringly hot day gives way to the close, sagging warmth of an evening by the sea. It\u2019s not cheap at \u00a340, but consider the sheer volume of fish. Also, I will from now on be furiously shredding and deep-frying flatbreads.</p>    <p>We finish with their knefe, a wedge of sweet and salty melted cheese spreading gently across the plate and topped by a lozenge of syrup-soaked pastry, fragrant with rose and pistachio. Alongside is a bowl of a set milk pudding, dressed with orange blossom and rose water. Finally, we have thimbles of thick, dark coffee, heavy with black cardamom. We are alone in the dining room this lunchtime which, as ever, seems completely wrong. No, Joseph\u2019s is not cheap. You may find cheaper Lebanese food amid the community clustered around the Edgware Road, but it is not outrageous for Kensington High Street, and you can get a shawarma wrap here for \u00a39. As we are leaving Joseph asks us sweetly if we will leave a positive review on Google. In the sense that this will indeed turn up somewhere on Google, I like to think that I\u2019ve done as he asked.</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>StreetSmart, the charity that tackles homelessness, has launched its annual campaign to raise funds in the run-up to Christmas through an extra \u00a31 added to restaurant bills. More than 600 restaurants and pubs are participating this year, including veterans of the campaign like St John and the River Caf\u00e9, alongside Mana in Manchester, Box E in Bristol, Upstairs by Tom Shepherd in Lichfield and Ynyshir in Wales. To find out more about what the charity does with the cash raised and for a full list of participating restaurants, visit <a href=\"http://streetsmart.org.uk/\">streetsmart.org.uk</a></p> <p>There\u2019s good news for those who don\u2019t want to schlep to an out-of-town flatpack furniture warehouse to get their fix of Swedish meatballs and Dime Bar cakes. Ikea has opened its first standalone restaurant, in London\u2019s Hammersmith. The 75-seat caf\u00e9, which occupies the site of a what was a branch of Wasabi, is next door to the newly renovated Ikea Hammersmith City Store, and will also be open for breakfast.</p> <p>Chef Claude Bosi and his wife, Lucy, are opening a second Josephine Bouchon, the bistro celebrating the food of Bosi\u2019s native Lyon, which opened to such acclaim in London\u2019s Fulham earlier this year. The new restaurant will be in Marylebone and will take over the site of what was Daylesford Organic on Blandford Street (<a href=\"http://josephinebouchon.com/\">josephinebouchon.com</a>)</p> <p><em>Join Jay Rayner and Grace Dent on Monday 16 December as they discuss his new cookbook Nights Out At Home, live at Kings Place and livestreamed globally.

We finish with their knefe, a wedge of sweet and salty melted cheese spreading gently across the plate and topped by a lozenge of syrup-soaked pastry, fragrant with rose and pistachio. Alongside is a bowl of a set milk pudding, dressed with orange blossom and rose water. Finally, we have thimbles of thick, dark coffee, heavy with black cardamom. We are alone in the dining room this lunchtime which, as ever, seems completely wrong. No, Joseph\u2019s is not cheap. You may find cheaper Lebanese food amid the community clustered around the Edgware Road, but it is not outrageous for Kensington High Street, and you can get a shawarma wrap here for \u00a39. As we are leaving Joseph asks us sweetly if we will leave a positive review on Google. In the sense that this will indeed turn up somewhere on Google, I like to think that I\u2019ve done as he asked. News bites StreetSmart, the charity that tackles homelessness, has launched its annual campaign to raise funds in the run-up to Christmas through an extra \u00a31 added to restaurant bills. More than 600 restaurants and pubs are participating this year, including veterans of the campaign like St John and the River Caf\u00e9, alongside Mana in Manchester, Box E in Bristol, Upstairs by Tom Shepherd in Lichfield and Ynyshir in Wales. To find out more about what the charity does with the cash raised and for a full list of participating restaurants, visit streetsmart.org.uk There\u2019s good news for those who don\u2019t want to schlep to an out-of-town flatpack furniture warehouse to get their fix of Swedish meatballs and Dime Bar cakes. Ikea has opened its first standalone restaurant, in London\u2019s Hammersmith. The 75-seat caf\u00e9, which occupies the site of a what was a branch of Wasabi, is next door to the newly renovated Ikea Hammersmith City Store, and will also be open for breakfast. Chef Claude Bosi and his wife, Lucy, are opening a second Josephine Bouchon, the bistro celebrating the food of Bosi\u2019s native Lyon, which opened to such acclaim in London\u2019s Fulham earlier this year. The new restaurant will be in Marylebone and will take over the site of what was Daylesford Organic on Blandford Street (josephinebouchon.com) Join Jay Rayner and Grace Dent on Monday 16 December as they discuss his new cookbook Nights Out At Home, live at Kings Place and livestreamed globally.

Involving North Korea is a clear example of Putin responding to the alliance against him, and if we have learned one thing, it should be that Putin doesn\u2019t bluff. Des Senior Aylesbeare, Devon Art for health\u2019s sake I absolutely agree with Richard Brooks\u2019 article on the benefits of paintings in hospitals \u201cA picture of health: how paintings in hospitals can help patients feel better\u201d, News). Some 20 years ago, I was commissioned by the arts committee of St Mary\u2019s Paddington to paint a 16ft painting for the corridor of the X-ray department, followed by a commission from A&amp;E for three more paintings. Under new hygiene rules brought in during the Covid pandemic and the need to disinfect all surfaces, the 16ft piece was destroyed trying to get it into a lift and all the other paintings are now in storage. One of the ways around this is for artists to paint directly on to walls and the Bridget Riley corridor at St Mary\u2019s survived, so how about some Banksies? Jane Swan Delabole, Cornwall We\u2019re destroying life on Earth With reference to Martha Gill\u2019s article on global warming and the world biodiversity crisis, thank god for a bit of sense (\u201cWe are in danger of forgetting what the climate crisis means: extinction\u201d, Comment, last week). She\u2019s absolutely correct that public discourse on the two existential crises facing the world is increasingly about climate change and global warming, at the expense of full, honest coverage of world biodiversity loss. Constant emphasis on the latest average temperature increases and the exact reductions necessary to stabilise world climate is dangerously narrowing our focus on the overall effects we\u2019re having on the environment. Many, if not most, plant and animal species can adapt to climate change and have done many times in the historical, prehistoric and geological past. What they cannot survive is rapid habitat or food-source loss, serious pollution or rapacious over-exploitation on land and sea. We are knowingly doing massive environmental damage that has nothing whatsoever to do with global warming. Are we humans concerned only about ourselves and those species useful to us or are we, can we be, what we should be \u2013 wise custodians of all species? Dr Peter Perry Paul, Penzance, Cornwall Animal gene-editing dangers The complainants in the story \u201cScientists dismayed as UK ministers clear way for gene editing of crops \u2013 but not animals\u201d (News) are either disingenuous or astonishingly ill-informed. As the Green party said throughout the debate on the genetic technology bill \u2013 and as the animal welfare groups explain in the article \u2013 producing \u201chardier\u201d animals, to be kept in dreadful factory-farmed conditions, is not only morally indefensible but also a major public and environmental health risk: resistance to one disease does not mean resistance to other threats, for example, the spread of H5N1 \u201cavian\u201d flu in US dairy herds. Natalie Bennett, Green Party peer House of Lords Elton who? The cost of an unusual first name may be manifested in subtler ways than on economic opportunity as highlighted by Torsten Bell (\u201cI didn\u2019t mind my unusual first name \u2013 until I found it could cost me dearly\u201d, Comment). My brother and I were given what were, at the time, unusual first names. His was Elton and he became a jazz saxophonist who early in his career played briefly in John Baldry\u2019s band, Bluesology, alongside a then equally unknown keyboard player, Reggie Dwight, who decided Elton was a cool name (while also adopting John Baldry\u2019s first name). My name never became cool but remained just weird. Professor Hartley Dean Flamstead, St Albans Life in the slow lane David Mitchell\u2019s inspired piece, referencing the absurdness of exceptional forward planning (\u201cWhy be an early bird, if you don\u2019t want worms?\u201d, New Review, last week), made me want to live in the slow lane where I can contemplate and appreciate daily life, hopefully without getting an ulcer.

Michelle Barrett, 38, who grew up in a council house in Liverpool with views of the Clwydian mountain range, which will be part of the park, said the countryside was for everyone. \u201cThe news of a national park is absolutely amazing and will open up the landscape for us,\u201d said Barrett, who regularly gets on the train to go hiking in north-east Wales. \u201cWho gets to stipulate who is welcome and who is not? Being able to leave where you live and go to a place where you can breathe a bit of fresh air \u2026 that\u2019s a right for everybody.\u201d</p>    <p>Whereas Britain\u2019s original national parks were established in the 1950s to give working people opportunities for open-air recreation and to preserve natural beauty, the new park will also aim to restore the area\u2019s biodiversity and mitigate against the climate crisis. These goals appeal to long-term visitors such as Barrett, who is a supporter of the Right to Roam campaign. The countryside, she said, \u201cis beautiful and you get to see big, wide horizons, which does something for your psyche. But in terms of biodiversity, sometimes I have better experiences with wildlife in my back garden \u2026 if [the national park] is going to improve biodiversity, river health and the climate crisis, then that\u2019s exciting.\u201d</p> <p>Farmers inside the proposed boundaries, however, are concerned that the national park would hold back development, which could imperil their businesses. Sarah Lewis, who runs a sheep and cattle farm near Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant, claims farmers could be stopped from putting up additional buildings or diversifying into haulage or light manufacturing. \u201cAny future development will be stifled because of more stringent planning regulations,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cWe will become a museum and a tourist attraction, as opposed to a food production industry \u2026 We are canvassing support to ensure [the national park] is stopped in its tracks.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/03/nature-england-under-threat-protected-land-falls-data\">Nature in England at risk as amount of land \u2018effectively protected\u2019 falls to 2.93%</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lewis fears her daughter would not be able to afford a home in the area. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a national park \u2026 affluent people from London and places like that think \u2018we want a piece of that beautiful countryside\u2019, which is all well and good, but then they buy [homes] at the cost of a young family wanting to remain in the area.\u201d</p> <p>The cost of running a new national park is also driving local opposition. Powys, which would be expected to contribute 25% of the new park\u2019s budget, needs to make at least \u00a350.9m worth of cuts over the next four years.</p> <p>Existing national parks have also had their budgets shrink by 40% in the past decade and Natural Resources Wales, which is running the consultation, is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0lp4x1jwn9o\">closing shops and cafes</a> at its visitor centres and making redundancies. Lewis said: \u201cSurely it would be better to spend it on the essential services, not some pipe dream of another national park?\u201d</p> <p>Supporters of the plan point out that the first national parks were established by a country emerging from the ravages of the second world war, when national debt peaked at around 270% of GDP.</p> <p> John Roberts, who chairs The Clwydian Range and Dee Valley National Landscape access committee, which covers part of the proposed new park, said all the national parks should be properly funded: \u201cWhen national parks were set up \u2026 life was very difficult in this country but resources were made available for very significant improvements to people\u2019s access to the countryside.\u201d</p> <p>He believes national parks could be a crucial part of the country\u2019s efforts to avoid runaway climate change. </p> <p>The current consultation on a new national park states it would have the secure funding and planning to address problems such as nature restoration and the climate crisis. \u201cThe climate is changing \u2026 and unless we give national parks the opportunity to address this crisis we\u2019re all going to be in trouble,\u201d said Roberts.</p>",

Being able to leave where you live and go to a place where you can breathe a bit of fresh air \u2026 that\u2019s a right for everybody.\u201d Whereas Britain\u2019s original national parks were established in the 1950s to give working people opportunities for open-air recreation and to preserve natural beauty, the new park will also aim to restore the area\u2019s biodiversity and mitigate against the climate crisis. These goals appeal to long-term visitors such as Barrett, who is a supporter of the Right to Roam campaign. The countryside, she said, \u201cis beautiful and you get to see big, wide horizons, which does something for your psyche. But in terms of biodiversity, sometimes I have better experiences with wildlife in my back garden \u2026 if [the national park] is going to improve biodiversity, river health and the climate crisis, then that\u2019s exciting.\u201d Farmers inside the proposed boundaries, however, are concerned that the national park would hold back development, which could imperil their businesses. Sarah Lewis, who runs a sheep and cattle farm near Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant, claims farmers could be stopped from putting up additional buildings or diversifying into haulage or light manufacturing. \u201cAny future development will be stifled because of more stringent planning regulations,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cWe will become a museum and a tourist attraction, as opposed to a food production industry \u2026 We are canvassing support to ensure [the national park] is stopped in its tracks.\u201d Lewis fears her daughter would not be able to afford a home in the area. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a national park \u2026 affluent people from London and places like that think \u2018we want a piece of that beautiful countryside\u2019, which is all well and good, but then they buy [homes] at the cost of a young family wanting to remain in the area.\u201d The cost of running a new national park is also driving local opposition. Powys, which would be expected to contribute 25% of the new park\u2019s budget, needs to make at least \u00a350.9m worth of cuts over the next four years. Existing national parks have also had their budgets shrink by 40% in the past decade and Natural Resources Wales, which is running the consultation, is closing shops and cafes at its visitor centres and making redundancies. Lewis said: \u201cSurely it would be better to spend it on the essential services, not some pipe dream of another national park?\u201d Supporters of the plan point out that the first national parks were established by a country emerging from the ravages of the second world war, when national debt peaked at around 270% of GDP. John Roberts, who chairs The Clwydian Range and Dee Valley National Landscape access committee, which covers part of the proposed new park, said all the national parks should be properly funded: \u201cWhen national parks were set up \u2026 life was very difficult in this country but resources were made available for very significant improvements to people\u2019s access to the countryside.\u201d He believes national parks could be a crucial part of the country\u2019s efforts to avoid runaway climate change. The current consultation on a new national park states it would have the secure funding and planning to address problems such as nature restoration and the climate crisis. \u201cThe climate is changing \u2026 and unless we give national parks the opportunity to address this crisis we\u2019re all going to be in trouble,\u201d said Roberts.",

By then, a year\u2019s worth of rain had fallen in some areas in a matter of hours and the flood waters in Utiel were three metres high. Even as emergency teams search for the 78 people still listed as missing, questions are being asked about the authorities\u2019 handling of the crisis, one that has brought out the very worst, and the very best, in people. The disaster was declared a level two emergency, meaning the regional government \u2013 run by the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) \u2013 has responsibility. Had the Valencian authorities concluded they could no longer handle the situation, the level could have been raised to allow the socialist-led central government to step in and take over.

At 7.36am the next morning, it updated its alerts in the region and by 9.41am, the entire province of Valencia was on red alert, with people warned of \u201cextreme danger\u201d in some areas and urged to keep away from rivers, gullies and flood-prone lowlands. At midday, Aemet released a video asking people to stay put. As the severity of the floods became apparent, the central government\u2019s representative in Valencia cancelled her agenda and called the region\u2019s interior minister three times between noon and 2pm, offering help and resources. About 1pm on Tuesday, Valencia\u2019s PP regional president, Carlos Maz\u00f3n, was recorded on video saying that the rains were moving away and would ease up in Valencia by the early evening. A video of his forecast was later removed from his account on X. According to Spanish media reports, Maz\u00f3n had a long lunch with a journalist until about 6pm. He arrived at the emergency command centre at about 7.30pm, where he was brought up to speed on the state of the floods. The Valencian government, which maintains control of the emergency, did not request the deployment across the entire region of the Spanish armed forces Military Emergencies Unit (UME) until after 8pm on Tuesday, about the time the civil protection alert was finally issued. On Thursday last week, the region\u2019s interior minister told Valencian TV that she only found out about the mobile alert technology after a phone call from the central government\u2019s environment ministry. Maz\u00f3n has responded to criticisms by seeking to blame Spain\u2019s socialist government and even the UME. But sources in the administration of prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez are adamant it did everything it could to warn of the disaster and is doing everything in its power to alleviate its aftermath within the constraints of a highly decentralised state. Although the PP has pointedly thanked the other regions it governs for sending help to Valencia, it has accused S\u00e1nchez of acting in \u201cbad faith\u201d during the crisis. Others have gone further in their condemnation of the prime minister. A column in the rightwing ABC newspaper this week accused S\u00e1nchez and his government of seeking to blame the deaths on climate change and people\u2019s inability to heed the weather warnings. \u201cIf Spaniards today weren\u2019t so lily-livered, we\u2019d be hanging them and quartering them and putting their remains on display in the public square so they could be bait for flies and carrion-feeders, as should be the fate of tyrants,\u201d it added. Delays in providing and updating the tolls of the dead and the missing have given rise to conspiracy theories and fuelled disinformation. The human tragedy, meanwhile, has been embraced by a self-declared \u201cfascist\u201d influencer using TikTok likes to decide which of the affected areas should receive aid paid for by his followers. But despite the politicking, the recrimination and the outbreaks of looting, the most remarkable feature of the disaster has been the surge of solidarity it has elicited. Broom-wielding volunteers and tractor owners have arrived in the hardest hit parts of Valencia, offering help, muscle and comfort. As well as the videos of cars spinning helplessly along torrents of mud-coloured water and pictures of sodden piles of furniture, one of the abiding images of the disaster will be of the thousands of broom-and-bucket clutching volunteers crossing a bridge in Valencia to reach those in need.

<p>Australian investors will feast on a smorgasbord of labour market data this week as they digest the ramifications of a second <strong>Donald Trump</strong> presidency for the global economy.</p> <p>The Republican septuagenarian\u2019s return to the White House has led to expectations inflation could heat up again in the US, given his promises to raise tariffs on imported goods and slash taxes.</p> <p>That didn\u2019t stop the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates for their second meeting in a row by 0.25% on Thursday.</p> <p>Even before Trump has a chance to put his hands on the economic levers, core US inflation is expected to rise 0.3% when the October consumer price index is released on Wednesday.</p> <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia is still lagging its American counterpart, with no indication it is close to beginning its rate easing cycle.</p> <p>The RBA governor, <strong>Michele</strong> <strong>Bullock,</strong> told a Senate estimates hearing last week the US election had no impact on her inflation outlook and her recent remarks have signalled greater focus on domestic factors.</p> <p>Speaking after the RBA board meeting on Tuesday, during which it held the cash rate at 4.35%, she indicated ongoing strength in the labour market was creating upside risks in the inflation outlook.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Survey measures continue to indicate labour availability is constrained, wages growth has continued to ease, but still generally above rates consistent with inflation targets given the weak productivity growth.</p> </blockquote> <p>Wages growth is expected to slow to 3.6% when the wage price index is released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday, due largely to a bumper 5.75% increase in award wages dropping out of the data set, Commsec chief economist, <strong>Ryan Felsman</strong>, said.</p> <p>The bureau\u2019s labour force survey, to be released the following day, is expected to show an extra 20,000 jobs added to the Australian economy in October, with the unemployment rate edging from 4.1% to 4.2%, according to CBA economists.</p> <p>They predict the participation rate to remain at a record 67.2%.</p> <p>An upside surprise to one or both readouts could reinforce the RBA\u2019s hawkish tone.</p> <p>CBA\u2019s household spending insights report, alongside consumer and business confidence surveys by Westpac and NAB on Tuesday, will provide further insights.</p> <p>- <strong>AAP</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

Before we go, here are the major stories from Sunday: Residents of Australia\u2019s northern regions have sweltered as a heatwave has continued through the weekend, and is expected to linger into next week; The health minister, Mark Butler, says the US election shows voters are \u201cfocused overwhelmingly on cost of living\u201d The Greens are mounting a push to give the Great Australian Bight world heritage status; Pregnant women and infants will get free RSV vaccines under an expanded program; The parliamentary workplace support service announced it has handled 339 complaints in its first nine months; Independent senator Fatima Payman has called for the Australian government to impose sanctions and divest from Israel at a pro-Palestine rally in Melbourne. We\u2019ll pick things up again tomorrow. Police investigating after woman\u2019s body found in western Sydney hotel A man is under police guard and an investigation is under way after the body of a woman was found in Penrith a short time ago. Emergency services were called to a hotel at 1.10pm on Sunday where they discovered the woman\u2019s body in a hotel room along with a man. The man, believed to be in his 50s, was treated by NSW Ambulance paramedics before being airlifted to Westmead hospital in a critical condition. The woman is yet to be formally identified. Officers attached to Nepean police area command have established a crime scene, with inquiries to be conducted by detectives, assisted by state crime command\u2019s homicide squad. Large bump in weekend auction numbers and clearance rates Auction activity has surged this weekend with 2,820 auctions to be held. This is a significant increase on the 1,972 held last week, but a modest gain on the 2,656 auctions that occurred at the same time last year. Based on results collected so far, CoreLogic\u2019s summary found that the preliminary clearance rate was 65.8% across the country, which is an improvement on the 63.4% preliminary rate recorded last week and well above the 56.3% actual rate on final numbers. Across the capital cities: Sydney: 773 of 1,073 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 68.2% Melbourne: 908 of 1,293 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 69.8% Brisbane: 109 0f 175 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 53.2% Adelaide: 67 of 160 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 70.1% Canberra: 62 of 94 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 45.2% Hobart: Two of three auctions held. Perth: Thirteen of 22 auctions held. Labour figures to be released this week as Australian economists assess ramifications of Trump win Australian investors will feast on a smorgasbord of labour market data this week as they digest the ramifications of a second Donald Trump presidency for the global economy. The Republican septuagenarian\u2019s return to the White House has led to expectations inflation could heat up again in the US, given his promises to raise tariffs on imported goods and slash taxes. That didn\u2019t stop the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates for their second meeting in a row by 0.25% on Thursday. Even before Trump has a chance to put his hands on the economic levers, core US inflation is expected to rise 0.3% when the October consumer price index is released on Wednesday. The Reserve Bank of Australia is still lagging its American counterpart, with no indication it is close to beginning its rate easing cycle. The RBA governor, Michele Bullock, told a Senate estimates hearing last week the US election had no impact on her inflation outlook and her recent remarks have signalled greater focus on domestic factors. Speaking after the RBA board meeting on Tuesday, during which it held the cash rate at 4.35%, she indicated ongoing strength in the labour market was creating upside risks in the inflation outlook. Survey measures continue to indicate labour availability is constrained, wages growth has continued to ease, but still generally above rates consistent with inflation targets given the weak productivity growth. Wages growth is expected to slow to 3.6% when the wage price index is released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday, due largely to a bumper 5.75% increase in award wages dropping out of the data set, Commsec chief economist, Ryan Felsman, said. The bureau\u2019s labour force survey, to be released the following day, is expected to show an extra 20,000 jobs added to the Australian economy in October, with the unemployment rate edging from 4.1% to 4.2%, according to CBA economists. They predict the participation rate to remain at a record 67.2%. An upside surprise to one or both readouts could reinforce the RBA\u2019s hawkish tone. CBA\u2019s household spending insights report, alongside consumer and business confidence surveys by Westpac and NAB on Tuesday, will provide further insights. - AAP Refugee football match held in Sydney to highlight visa limbo Former Socceroos captain Craig Foster has umpired a friendly football match on Sunday between Tamil and Bangladeshi refugees who are still waiting for permanent visas from Australia, in some cases for 12 years. The asylum seekers have been part of a vigil held outside the Punchbowl electorate office of the home affairs and immigration minister, Tony Burke, for 100 days. The vigil, which runs 24 hours a day, involved long-term asylum seekers from multiple nationalities who have been left waiting for a visa under a Coalition-era fast track policy. They say Labor has yet to introduce a solution. Foster said the situation amounted to a punishment for people trying to seek asylum. Over a decade without permanence is ridiculous, punitive and unnecessary. I want to remind our millions-strong football community that these communities are our own. They were victims of an unjust and flawed system. It\u2019s time for the Australian government to let them get on with their lives. The match was held in Lakemba, part of Burke\u2019s electorate. \u2018No stopping\u2019 Melbourne suburban rail loop as state strikes $1.7bn deal The Victorian government\u2019s contentious Suburban Rail Loop \u201ccannot be stopped\u201d as a cloud hangs over the rollout of its new public transport ticket system. Global consortium Terra Verde has been awarded a $1.7bn tunnelling contract for the $34.5bn eastern section of the rail line. The deal is to build 10km twin tunnels between Glen Waverley and Box Hill, with another consortium already signing a $3.6bn deal to tunnel the rest of the 26km stretch from Cheltenham. The Labor state government said the latest tunnelling deal came in under what was initially budgeted but the premier, Jacinta Allan, did not say by how much. It demonstrates there is huge competitive interest from these global construction companies. The entire 90km orbital rail line is designed to run from Cheltenham to Werribee via Melbourne airport. Boring on the first phase of the loop is expected to begin in 2026, with completion slated for 2035. The transport infrastructure minister, Danny Pearson, said there was \u201csimply no stopping\u201d the project as early works power ahead at at all six station sites. You can\u2019t stop this project. Victoria has pledged $11.8bn to build the eastern section, with a third of funding expected to come from the federal government and the rest from unexplained \u201cvalue capture\u201d revenue. The Albanese government has only committed $2.2bn for the project so far, leaving a $20bn funding hole. The entire project was initially estimated to cost up to $50bn in 2018, before its 2021 official business case showed the east and north sections could cost between $30.7bn and $57.6bn. The state\u2019s independent Parliamentary Budget Office cast doubt on that estimate, putting the cost to build the first two sections at $125bn. - AAP Crisafulli expands assistant ministry to 10 positions Queensland\u2019s new premier, David Crisafulli, says his government will \u201cbe supported by a young and hungry generation next assistant ministry\u201d. The premier has expanded the assistant ministry to 10 positions, as in New South Wales, to \u201cprovide a pathway for future leadership\u201d with a heavy focus on representation from regional Queensland. Leader of the House, Dr Christian Rowan, and Trevor Watts will be assistant ministers to the premier on matters of state and cabinet, with newly elected members of parliament to be appointed to a further eight roles. The full assistant ministry includes: Dr Christian Rowan \u2013 assistant minister to the premier on matters of state and new citizens. Trevor Watts \u2013 assistant minister to the premier for cabinet and south west Queensland. Amanda Stoker \u2013 assistant minister for finance, trade, employment and training Herman Vorster \u2013 assistant minister for multicultural affairs and international student attraction Rebecca Young \u2013 assistant minister to the deputy premier and assistant minister for planning, housing and better regulation Janelle Poole \u2013 assistant minister for community safety, defence industry, veterans and north Queensland Bryson Head \u2013 assistant minister for regional development, resources and critical minerals. Bree James \u2013 assistant minister for tourism, early learning, creative industries and far north Queensland Donna Kirkland \u2013 assistant minister for mental health, drug and alcohol treatment, families and seniors and central Queensland Sean Dillion \u2013 assistant minister for primary industry development, water and western Queensland. Crisafulli said his picks \u201cwill be instrumental in delivering for Queenslanders\u201d. These assistant ministers are hungry to serve and their energy and hard work will be harnessed to benefit the length and breadth of our state. Their roles will also be about listening to Queenslanders to inform strong policy development. Senator Fatima Payman has spoken to a pro-Palestine rally in Melbourne calling for the Australian government to impose sanctions and divestment against Israel. Today we continue the call on this complicit Labor government to take a stand against the illegal Israeli occupation, for sanctions, for divestment, for recognition of a Palestinian state. Police search for SUV in NSW Central Coast waterway A police operation is under way for an SUV believed to be submerged in a waterway on Central Coast. Emergency services were called to The Boulevarde, Woy Woy, at about 11am on Sunday after a vehicle \u2013 believed to be a small green SUV \u2013 ran off a wharf and into the Woy Woy channel. Officers attached to Brisbane Water Police District have established a crime scene and \u2013 with assistance of Marine Area Command, NSW Maritime and NSW Ambulance \u2013 are coordinating a search for the vehicle. Based on information provided to police, the male driver is believed to be the sole occupant. SA Liberals accused of spending taxpayer funds on byelection opinion polling The South Australian Liberal Party is accused of \u201can outrageous abuse of taxpayers\u2019 money\u201d after allegedly spending thousands of dollars on internal polling ahead of a tense byelection. But the opposition has hit back, saying the spending was approved by the Treasury. The Labor government says it has seen leaked information that strategist firm Freshwater was paid $25,905 to conduct research for the Liberals before Saturday\u2019s byelection in Black. Freshwater was paid using the Global Allowance entitlement, the guidance of which excludes \u201celection expenses, other than Postal Vote Applications\u201d. The treasurer, Stephen Mullighan, said taxpayers were charged almost $40,000 for polling, public relations support and letters to constituents endorsing the Liberal candidate in the byelection. On the face of it, this is an outrageous abuse of taxpayers\u2019 money by the Liberal Party. Mulligan also suggested that the invoice was for polling reported on by The Advertiser on 10 October which was used to \u201croad-test\u201d two local councillors as prospective candidates for the Black by-election. \u201cClearly the Liberal party concocted this scheme to avoid having to pay for the internal polling themselves,\u201d he said. But the SA Liberals\u2019 state director, Alexander Hyde, maintained the funding had been approved by Treasury. - AAP Beautiful, eco-friendly and fire resistant: why architects are choosing walls made of hemp Michael Leung first came across hempcrete after a family tragedy. When his father-in-law died from asbestos-related mesothelioma, Leung, an architect, swore off using toxic materials in building. When you go on a healthy building journey, inevitably you bump into hempcrete. Building with hemp is growing in popularity, from public buildings in Tasmania to private homes in Byron Bay, with architects looking to more sustainable materials in one of the world\u2019s most carbon intensive industries. With the ability to capture more than twice its own weight in carbon, purported insulation, moisture- and fire-proof qualities, and now with a hempcrete building winning a National Architecture Awards nod, the eco-material is cementing its place in modern construction. For more on this story, read the full report by Guardian Australia\u2019s Maddie Thomas: NSW to establish state-owned toll road operator and ombudsman A government-run toll body will soon be written into law but Sydney motorists shouldn\u2019t expect it to drive down prices right away. The Minns Labor government will introduce legislation into parliament this week to create NSW Motorways, a state-owned entity to oversee the Sydney toll road network. The entity will operate tollways not subject to private concession arrangements such as the Sydney Harbour Bridge and tunnel, as well as the Western Harbour Tunnel and M6 Stage 1, once complete. It will take over the collection of all tolls and oversee any future revenue adjustment mechanism to protect private toll concessionaires from losses and prevent windfall gains falling into their hands from system reforms. Private contracts with concessionaires won\u2019t be overridden under the legislation, with the NSW government declaring it still prefers a \u201cnegotiated outcome\u201d through a \u201cdirect deal process\u201d. The Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal will also be empowered to monitor toll prices, investigate specific tolling issues and make recommendations. An independent tolling customer ombudsman would be set up to deal with disputes and complaints, with toll operators bound by its decision. - AAP Animal advocates condemn \u2018barbaric\u2019 use of chemical foam to cull 30,000 ducks in Victoria About 30,000 farmed ducks were killed using firefighting foam as part of the Victorian government\u2019s effort to contain bird flu, a method Animal Justice party MP Georgie Purcell has condemned as \u201cnothing short of barbaric\u201d. The state\u2019s agriculture minister, Ros Spence, confirmed Agriculture Victoria used Phos-Chek, a class-A foam, while responding to a highly contagious strain of avian influenza, or bird flu, which emerged earlier this year at several poultry farms. \u201cFoaming is approved for use in biosecurity emergencies and was deployed to ensure a rapid and humane method of depopulation,\u201d Spence said in response to a parliamentary question from Purcell. Phos-Check is used globally as an alternative to other firefighting foams that contain per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are known to have harmful enivornmental effects. For more on this story, read the full report by Guardian Australia\u2019s Benita Kolovos: Victorian premier warns against \u2018American-style\u2019 misinformation around Indigenous treaty negotiations The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has warned against the state\u2019s nation-leading treaty negotiations being subjected to misinformation and \u201cAmerican-style division\u201d. The First Peoples\u2019 Assembly \u2013 Victoria\u2019s democratically elected Indigenous body \u2013 will begin negotiating a statewide treaty with the Allan government later this month. The state\u2019s opposition spokesperson for Aboriginal affairs, Peter Walsh, told the Herald Sun on Sunday the government was \u201cstarting secret treaty negotiations\u201d. Speaking to reporters, Allan says all Victorians \u201cdeserve the information and the facts around how treaty is being negotiated\u201d: Let\u2019s not bring American-style division, any more, into our community. Let\u2019s not create division \u2026 Let\u2019s not bring this misinformation, disinformation, fake news information into something that is just so important. Littleproud says parliamentary support service report shows workers \u2018comfortable to come forward\u2019 The Nationals leader David Littleproud told Nine\u2019s Today program on Sunday that it was on MPs and senators to make Parliament House a safe workplace, after it was revealed there had been 30 complaints of sexual assault, stalking and assault in federal parliament. What these numbers today demonstrate that after 12 months of reforms, it shows that we\u2019ve created an environment where people feel comfortable to come forward. We\u2019ve got to create that environment, and I think we\u2019re doing that, and these numbers demonstrate that those reforms are slowly working, but we can all do better, whether it be in Parliament House or outside Parliament House. Federal parliament\u2019s workplace support service has handled 30 complaints of sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking and assault in its first nine months of operation. Figures from the Parliamentary Workplace Support Service\u2019s annual report show the body handled 339 complaints in its first few months of operation. Between October 2023 and the end of June 2024, 30 of the cases managed by the services concerned rape or sexual assault, assault, sexual harassment, harassment, stalking or intimidation. A further 33 cases in the nine-month timeframe were about bullying. The report said 62 cases involved family or domestic violence, alcohol and drugs or mental health, while there were 90 cases of workplace conflict being managed. The support service was established after a recommendation from the landmark Set the Standard report, which examined widespread misconduct in federal parliament. Speaking to Sky News on Sunday, the health minister, Mark Butler, said more needed to be done to address workplace conduct at Parliament House. It\u2019s really concerning, but as many who have worked in parliament or around parliament for a long time perhaps have said, it\u2019s not entirely surprising. This is a workplace that really does need to lift its standards, and I think putting that process or that structure in place is an important first step. People need to be held accountable for poor behaviour. This process is starting to work, but I think this report really concerningly shows that parliament still has a way to go. MPs passed laws earlier this year to establish an Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission, with powers to investigate workplace conduct and enforce a behavioural code. - AAP \u2018I\u2019m not optimistic\u2019: the Australians who sounded the climate alarm 55 years ago Half a century ago, Richard Gun stood on the floor of parliament and became the first known Australian political figure to warn about the \u201csinister\u201d threat posed by climate change. Today his maiden speech is a distant memory. I never thought of myself as the first politician to issue a warning about climate change. At the time it seemed to me an existential threat to our civilisation and it seemed like a sufficiently important issue to mention. Looking back, I\u2019m a bit surprised other people didn\u2019t take it as seriously. As Australia prepares to participate in Cop29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, Gun\u2019s largely forgotten warning provides a poignant milestone to help measure the country\u2019s action on the climate crisis. With greenhouse gas emissions rising, fossil fuel production expanding, and devastating fire and floods becoming more frequent, the scale of these threats underscores the warnings given by political and scientific leaders all those years ago \u2013 and the amount of wasted time. For more, read the full feature: Pregnant women and babies will have greater protection against a condition known as respiratory syncytial virus as part of an expanded vaccination program. The federal government will spend more than $174m to give pregnant women a free vaccine for RSV ahead of next winter, with national access also expanded for newborns and young children. RSV is one of the leading causes of hospitalisation for young children, with 12,000 babies admitted each winter. The health minister, Mark Butler, told Sky News on Sunday that the expanded vaccination scheme would help to keep 10,000 babies out of hospital each year. We\u2019ve seen about 160,000 cases of RSV recorded over the course of this winter, half of them were under-four-year-olds. It really hits under-two-year-olds very, very hard. This [vaccination] program we think will cut that hospitalisation rate [for babies] up to 90%, a huge win for families. RSV is a respiratory virus that affects the nose, throat and lungs, with infants being most at risk. Butler said immunisations for pregnant women significantly reduces the risk of RSV in children under six months. Our combination approach, in partnership with each state and territory, will ensure that every single infant in Australia is protected ahead of the winter RSV season. This is a world-leading approach to reduce the impact of RSV on babies. \u2013 AAP The federal Greens will push for the Great Australian Bight to be given world heritage Protection status to protect the unique biodiversity in the area. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young will announce the introduction of a new bill to protect \u201ca vast array of marine life, including treasured whale species and sea lions\u201d on Sunday in a joint press conference with South Australian Greens MLC Rob Simms and Sarah Luscombe, Greens candidate in the Black by-election. The move follows industry efforts in recent years to drill for oil and gas in the Bight, raising concerns about the potential risk posed by oil spills, particularly on sensitive whale nurseries in the area. Hanson-Young said the federal bill offers \u201ca chance to protect and celebrate just how beautiful our Bight and coastline is\u201d. The Great Australian Bight is a precious part of South Australia and it should be protected from oil drilling and pollution forever. The Great Australian Bight is a South Australian icon. It has global significance because of the vast array of unique marine life, including treasured whale species and sea lions that live there. 85% of the species that live in the Bight are found nowhere else on Earth. Both the Federal and State Governments have been too slow in protecting the area. I will introduce new laws to the Federal Parliament to fast-track protection for the Great Australian Bight with World Heritage status. Trump win sends \u2018very strong message\u2019 to Albanese government, Michael Sukkar says The opposition housing spokesman, Michael Sukkar, also spoke to Sky News, where he said the US election result had sent a clear message to the Australian government. If we look at the electorate in the United States and the cost-of-living issues that they were dealing with, it\u2019s pretty clear that Australians are dealing with it at a much worse level. It sends a very strong message to this government. This government has been very distracted. While past comments from the prime minister that were critical of Trump emerged following the US election, Sukkar said he hoped the relationship between the two countries would strengthen. The United States and Australia alliance transcends leaders, it transcends political parties. We wish the prime minister the best and hope that he can do a little bit better than he\u2019s done in the past. - AAP Trump tariffs might have \u2018indirect\u2019 impact on Australian economy, Butler says Mark Butler said the relationship between Australia and the US will endure, regardless of who is in the White House. However, he said Australia\u2019s economy might be impacted by Trump\u2019s plans to impose tariffs. While Australian goods coming to the US may not be affected, tariffs applied to products from other countries could have flow-on effects. The greater concern that we have about any impact of that sort of change on Australia\u2019s economic interests is a more indirect impact about what it might do to global growth, to slow global growth even further, potentially to lift inflationary pressures in the global economy. That would have more a knock-on effect on Australia, rather than a direct change to the US-Australia trading arrangements. - AAP Donald Trump\u2019s comeback election victory is an indication voters want to see governments tackle cost-of-living issues, the health minister says. Issues surrounding the economy and high inflation led Trump back to the White House at the US election, becoming the first president in more than 130 years to win non-consecutive terms in office. With Australia\u2019s federal election due to be held by May, Mark Butler told Sky News on Sunday that while there are differences in political systems, there are takeaways before voters head to the polls. If you do take a lesson from the US election last week, it is the same lesson we take from other elections we\u2019ve seen over the last 12 or 24 months, and that is voters want to see their governments focused overwhelmingly on cost of living. Households (are) expressing a very clear view that they want their governments focused on them, they want their governments doing everything they responsibly can to help them through this cost-of-living crisis. Anthony Albanese will meet with the outgoing US president, Joe Biden, at the G20 and Apec summits in South America later in the week. - AAP Renewable energy in focus as leaders gather in Peru for Apec summit Transitioning to cleaner energy and working to reduce food wastage will feature at a major Asia-Pacific summit as world leaders prepare to meet in Peru. Peru is hosting the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) between Sunday and Saturday, with Anthony Albanese to attend later in the summit. Peru\u2019s ambassador to Australia, Vitaliano Gallardo, has been working to bolster economic co-operation, with the South American nation pushing for more investment in its mining and critical mineral sectors. The Apec grouping brings together more than 20 economies to promote trade and investment. Albanese has dismissed concerns a Donald Trump presidency would hinder a renewables rollout, pointing to Apec and sideline meetings \u2013 including with Indonesia\u2019s leader \u2013 as evidence of international co-operation on the issue. The summit was \u201ca useful forum for dialogue but it\u2019s not a decision-making forum\u201d that imposed binding agreements on members, the Australian Fair Trade and Investment Network convenor, Patricia Ranald, said. Ranald expects a focus on the transition to renewable energy, with a broad interest in decarbonising. They tend to make statements on what they agree on but I think there would be a shared interest in the transition to low-carbon, green energy economies. There\u2019s certainly a lot of interest in mining critical minerals. Given there was a session during the summit focusing on Indigenous people, Dr Ranald said she hoped their rights would be put front and centre of the debate around increased mining. - AAP \u2018\u201cWhat have you done for me today\u201d is how Donald Trump sees the world\u2019 On whether or not Anthony Albanese or the US ambassador, Kevin Rudd, might be in trouble for what they have previously said about Trump on social media, Edel says what people had said in the past is not as important as what they are promising to do going forward. What you said about Donald Trump in the past is less important to Donald Trump than what you are saying about him in the future, otherwise he would not have JD Vance as his vice president at this point. You can say horrible things about him and depending on what you are willing to say, \u201cwhat have you done for me today\u201d is how Donald Trump sees the world. Australia-US trade deficit \u2018matters enormously\u2019 to Trump, says thinktank chair Edel says he believes Australia \u201cis in a good position to advocate for itself\u201d It has a trade deficit with the United States. For reasons that only Donald Trump knows, this matters enormously to him, and so that is something, but, and I think this is true, whether or not we are talking about Aukus or about tariffs, Donald Trump has to hear the case directly from Australia. It is my personal relationships matter a lot. The fact that Australia runs a deficit with the United States should be a pretty good argument for their case, but they have to make that case with facts and figures directly to Trump himself. Edel has re-emphasised that uncertainty will be a feature of the Trump administration as \u201cDonald Trump loves being unpredictable\u201d and \u201cprides himself on this\u201d. Edel believes that \u201cin Donald Trump\u2019s mind that creates deterrence\u201d when dealing with other nations he considers adversaries. The challenge of course is, first of all, with adverse areas, if they don\u2019t know what your red lines are, if you are not clear about communicating those, you might find you have crept right over one. And with allies, they hear the same messages. An uncertain, unpredictable America is one that is very hard for allies to line up next to, so what is his unpredictability? Is it a strength, is it a liability? It is both, and it will be quite challenging to navigate this. Language of \u2018resilient infrastructure\u2019 may replace \u2018climate change\u2019 under Trump On the climate crisis, Edel says that the US \u201cwill not be a leader on climate change under Donald Trump\u201d. I don\u2019t think that is a surprise to anyone. Edel says this is an issue given that climate change has been identified by Pacific leaders as the number one security threat. It strikes me as this is going to be challenging. Particularly when you banish the term climate change from political lexicon. But when we begin to think about and talk about other things that will take place, like resilient infrastructure, that is something that Pacific will get behind and potentially a Trump administration can get behind too. Given the centrality of the climate crisis to Australia\u2019s engagement with Pacific Island countries, Edel is asked about what pressure that may put on the US-Australia relationship. He says a recognised need to secure critical minerals supply and growing renewable energy generation means the issue of climate breakdown is \u201cnot going to go away simply because they become too profitable\u201d. In the end, Edel says it all comes back to trade. That is not going to go away. Trump and those in his orbit are very strong on this. Trump \u2018should be able to get behind\u2019 Aukus On Aukus, Edel says that a Trump administration may be more amenable to maintaining the new alliance grouping, as it plays into his demand that individual countries engage in more self-reliance. It depends how well Australia can prosecute its case to Trump. Aukus looks like a deal that he should be able to get behind. Not only is Australia investing in the United States but this is a classic example of allies doing more for themselves and alongside the United States. Edel is asked about what will happen with the submarine program given that it is the next president who may ultimately decide to go ahead with the deal. Speers suggests that Donald Trump could still \u201ckill the deal\u201d in the meantime. He could. I think we have to be honest about that. But there are a couple of other things we need to consider. First of all, the president is not the only one who has a say. Congress actually sets the budget so there is a budgetary question here, too, about how high defence budgets are set and more importantly, the clause that you referred to, is whether or not the United States is producing enough capabilities. We have mandates for how many submarines, how many aircraft carriers, how many destroyers, the US is supposed to have. Edel: Taiwan in \u2018very dangerous position\u2019 under Trump 2.0 Asked about what the US may do regarding the future of Taiwan, Edel says a second Trump administration will be marked by uncertainty as it is unclear how his thinking will translate into action. Edel says that Trump\u2019s national security advisor \u201cdidn\u2019t care that much for Taiwan\u201d. And sometimes we hear words out of [Trump\u2019s] mouth that make it look like it is a bargaining chip to use against China. That is a very dangerous position for Taiwan itself. We\u2019ve also heard words from those in Trump\u2019s circle that they expect the Taiwanese to vastly ramp up their own spending on their own defences so it is a different picture of what we\u2019re about for Taiwan and one that we think is much more perilous in some ways. Asked if Taiwan should be nervous, Edel says: Taiwan has a lot of work to do for itself and with the Trump administration. Trump likely to take more \u201ccompetitive approach\u201d to international issues, thinktank head Charles Edel says ABC Insiders host David Speers is speaking to Charles Edel, Australia chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, about what a new Donald Trump administration means for Australia. Edel, an analyst who focuses on the US-Australian relationship, says a second Trump administration will view China as a competitor on the international stage. What things will begin to look at, is enhanced military posture around the region, it was a more competitive approach to technological competition. We talked about the economic space, and one of the things that I heard rather regularly from those serving in the administration was we\u2019re going to take a competitive on every issue and that means in international institutions like the United Nations where China has taken over seats like on the Human Rights Council, in the World Health Organization and other places, so it is an issue-by-issue specific question about what the exact policy will look like. But I think it is a starting point to assess that Trump will look to be bringing a range of options to that discussion. Edel says there will be a \u201cmore robust set of policies\u201d on trade policy, particularly tariffs \u2013 an issue that will affect Australia. ABC Insiders host David Speers is in Washington where he is covering the aftermath of the US presidential election campaign. He will speak to Charles Edel, the Australia Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, about what a Trump sequel will mean for Australia. More than half of Australia is sweating through a heatwave, with scorching temperatures in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory expected this weekend. Huge stretches of northern Australia had been warned by the Bureau of Meteorology to expect heatwave conditions stretching into next week. A severe heatwave warning was current for much of inland Queensland, with extreme and severe heatwave conditions affecting Richmond, Longreach, Roma and Charleville. Much of the area would see high temperatures stretch all the way up to Friday, with Mount Isa expected to reach maximums above 39C all week. Brisbane was now experiencing a \u201clow intensity\u201d heatwave with warm temperatures to continue until Friday. In the Northern Territory, heatwave conditions were affecting Timber Creek, which was due to hit 43C, and Katherine, where the mercury could top out at 42C. In Western Australia, much of the north coast was gripped by the heatwave, with Broome and Derby feeling the worst temperatures. For more, read the full report by Guardian Australia\u2019s Mostafa Rachwani: And welcome to another Sunday Guardian live blog. Half the country will sweat through a heatwave on Sunday, with scorching temperatures expected across Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. The Bureau of Meteorology has warned huge swathes of outback Australia will roast with the mercury hitting the 40s in some parts. Anthony Albanese will be jetting off to South America this week to meet regional leaders for a major Asia-Pacific summit. The annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) meeting between representatives of 20 economies to promote trade and investment kicks off in Peru today.

In the Northern Territory, Katherine and Timber Creek were expected to reach 42C while in Western Australia, Derby was expected to hit 38C, and 43C in Marble Bar \u2013 frequently one of the hottest places in the country. The heat was less intense in Sydney where the city was expected to hit a high of 26C on Sunday, with Melbourne\u2019s temperature reaching 20C, but from Monday the chance of thunderstorms will grow along the east coast. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Sydney is expected to hit a maximum of 23C on Monday and 24C on Tuesday with an 80% chance of rain ahead of a high chance of thunderstorms developing. In Melbourne the mercury is expected to hit 24C on Monday and 25C on Tuesday with a 60% chance of rain before falling back down to 18C on Thursday. Things will heat up going into next weekend, with a long-range forecast of 30C for next Saturday. Though heat conditions were easing in south-east Queensland, BoM senior meteorologist Miriam Bradbury said conditions across the north of the country would \u201clinger\u201d into next week. \u201cStorms are going to be the story for other parts of the country,\u201d Bradbury said. \u201cOver the next couple of days they\u2019re focused on south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales, which are a bit of a hotspot for storms. \u201cThis will potentially bringing heavy rain that could lead to flash flooding, large hail or damaging winds \u2013 these make the difference between a normal storm and a severe storm.\u201d These conditions will stretch across most of the country, including Victoria, outback South Australia and parts of Western Australia, with Perth looking stable and Hobart the only city on the east coast that is not currently expected to see lightning. \u201cIt\u2019s not that the storms will be widespread, but pretty much anywhere could see a lightning strike through the eastern parts of the country,\u201d Bradbury said. \u201cThese storms will change from one day to the next.\u201d",

In large part, that move was as much an effort to vote against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a> as many in the Arab and Muslim American communities have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/14/hamtramck-donald-trump-arab-american-muslim\">expressed anger</a> with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/biden-administration\">Biden administration</a> \u2013 and, by extension, Harris \u2013 for its support for Israel.</p> \n  <p>Analysts, while noting that the election was only a few days ago and a full picture of voting patterns has yet to emerge, suggest a multitude of reasons why a candidate so openly hostile to immigrants would be championed by them in such large numbers.</p> \n  <p>Fault, they say, can be attributed to Democrats\u2019 failure to understand the nuances of the Hispanic and Latino voting populations. There were clear signs as early as January that then candidate <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a></strong>\u2019s support from that demographic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/01/trump-biden-latino-voters-poll\">had cratered</a>, and Trump\u2019s was rising.</p> \n  <p>Ultimately, it was Republicans\u2019 economic messaging that broke through most, several experts said. That was then combined with an admiration for Trump\u2019s bombastic and pugnacious style among Latino men who, as much as white men and women who form his base, have no problem with his insults, racism and threats, because they don\u2019t believe he is talking about them.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThere seems to be an attraction to Trump among Latinos, Latino men, that could be a kind of defensive reaction to his aggression and aggressive rhetoric,\u201d said <strong>Guillermo Grenier</strong>, professor of sociology at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida\">Florida</a> International University and the co-author of the book This Land Is Our Land: Newcomers and Established Residents in Miami.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt could be they\u2019re saying: \u2018I\u2019m not one of them, you know?

The deal however was torpedoed in 2018 after the US unilaterally withdrew from it under Trump, who later reimposed sanctions on Tehran.</p> \n  <p>In response, Iran rolled back its obligations under the deal and has since enriched uranium up to 60%, just 30% lower than nuclear-grade. Tehran has repeatedly denied western countries\u2019 accusations that it is seeking to develop a nuclear weapon.</p> \n  <p>AFP reports that Zarif also said on Saturday that Trump\u2019s political approach towards Iran led to the increase in enrichment levels. \u201cHe must have realised that the maximum pressure policy that he initiated caused Iran\u2019s enrichment to reach 60% from 3.5%,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a man of calculation, he should do the math and see what the advantages and disadvantages of this policy have been and whether he wants to continue or change this harmful policy,\u201d Zarif added.</p> \n  <p>Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson, <strong>Esmaeil Baghaei</strong>, on Thursday said he hoped the president-elect\u2019s return to the White House would allow Washington to \u201crevise the wrong approaches of the past\u201d \u2013 however stopping short of mentioning Trump\u2019s name.</p> \n  <p>On Tuesday, Trump told reporters he was \u201cnot looking to do damage to Iran\u201d. \u201cMy terms are very easy.

Musk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/04/elon-musk-trump-pennsylvania-rally\">campaigned</a> for Trump both online and offline, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/22/elon-musk-pac-spending-facebook\">funded</a> advertising and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/26/trump-voter-turnout-elon-musk-pac\">get-out-the-vote operations</a> for a campaign at a severe financial disadvantage to its opponent. He even temporarily decamped from his home in Texas to the swing state of Pennsylvania, where he appeared at town hall events and held a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/05/elon-musk-america-pac-election-giveaway-lawsuit\">$1m daily giveaway</a> for voters.</p> \n  <p>Musk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/06/trump-billionaires-2024-campaign\">wasn\u2019t the only billionaire</a> rooting for Trump. But unlike some of his peers, who preferred operating in the shadows, shielded by Super Pacs and meetings behind closed doors, he became Trump\u2019s most visible surrogate. As so often with his endeavors, Musk was all in. And now, gambling on becoming one of Trump\u2019s most vocal and deep-pocketed supporters has won Musk direct influence and access to the nation\u2019s highest office, making him not only the world\u2019s richest man but also one of its most politically powerful.</p> \n  <p>Musk\u2019s exact role in the coming administration is still unclear. Trump has previously said that the CEO would lead a full audit of the federal government, and make drastic reforms as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/23/what-does-elon-musk-want-us-elections\">secretary of cost-cutting</a>\u201d.

And some women are, too, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/07/abortion-pills-hormones-trump\">online abortion pill orders spiking in the days after election day</a>. <br><br>Trump has said abortion is an issue for the states, not the federal government. Yet, during the campaign, he pointedly noted that he appointed justices to the supreme court who were in the majority when striking down the national right to abortion.

It would often taken feverish consultations with Trump\u2019s senior aides, including some in the Pentagon, before a plan \u2013 such as a premature withdrawal of 2,500 US troops from Afghanistan \u2013 could be finessed.</p> \n  <p>Now, for all the pro-forma congratulations, that sense of foreboding is back. Although only 4% of the American electorate said foreign policy was the most important issue to them in the election, for those watching from abroad it was the all-consuming preoccupation.</p> \n  <p>That is hardly surprising, as Trump represents an injection of highly combustible material into an already explosive world.

      "bodyText": "Here is a summary of the key recent developments: Republicans on Saturday appeared close to clinching control of the US House of Representatives, a critical element for Donald Trump to advance his agenda when the president-elect returns to the White House in January. With votes still being counted from the 5 November general election, Republicans had won 212 seats in the 435-member House, according to Edison Research, which projected on Friday night that Republican Jeff Hurd had enough votes to keep Republican control of Colorado\u2019s third congressional district. Voter rights groups on Saturday petitioned the Arizona supreme court to extend the deadline for voters to fix problems with their mail-in ballots following delays in vote counting and notifying voters about problems. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Campaign Legal Center asked the state\u2019s high court in an emergency petition that the original 5pm Sunday deadline be extended up to four days after a voter is sent notice of a problem. Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez has won reelection to Washington state\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, the Associated Press reports. Her victory gives the Democrats 201 House seats to Republicans\u2019 212 as the final votes are tallied to determine which party will control the House with 218 votes. Gluesenkamp Perez was first elected to the Senate two years ago when she won a close race for a seat that hadn\u2019t been held by a Democrat in more than a decade. Joe Biden has invited Donald Trump to the Oval Office on Wednesday at 11am ET. The meeting will be the first between the current and former president after the 2024 election. Trump announced the formation of the Trump Vance Inaugural Committee, which will be chaired by real estate investor Steve Witkoff and former Georgia senator Kelly Loeffler. As the president-elect begins to select his cabinet, he shared on Truth Social today that the administration will not include either former UN ambasssador Nikki Haley or former secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Thousands of New Yorkers gathered for the Protect Our Futures march, protesting Trump\u2019s re-election as president from outside Trump Tower, as more demonstrators gathered outside the offices of the Heritage Foundation (which authored the controversial Project 2025) in Washington DC. A Federal Emergency Management Agency employee has been fired after she instructed her team to avoid dispatching aid to houses with Trump signs following Hurricane Milton. More than two months after the deadline to sign presidential transition paperwork passed, Trump\u2019s incoming administration still has not signed the agreement with the General Services Administration. The agreements coordinating the transition, which were due 1 September, mandate that the incoming president agree to an ethics plan and limit and disclose private donations. A record 13 women will lead their states as governor next year, breaking the previously held record of 12 set after the 2022 election. Protests against Donald Trump erupted in the US on Saturday as people on both coasts took to the streets in frustration about his re-election. Thousands of people in major cities including New York City and Seattle demonstrated against the former president and now president-elect amid his threats against reproductive rights and pledges to carry out mass deportations at the start of his upcoming presidency. In New York City on Saturday, demonstrators from advocacy groups focused on workers\u2019 rights and immigrant justice crowded outside Trump International Hotel and Tower on 5th Avenue holding signs that read: \u201cWe protect us\u201d and \u201cMr President, how long must women wait for liberty?\u201d Others held signs that read: \u201cWe won\u2019t back down\u201d while chanting: \u201cHere we are and we\u2019re not leaving!\u201d Similar protests took place in Washington DC, where Women\u2019s March participants demonstrated outside the Heritage Foundation, the rightwing thinktank behind Project 2025. Pictures posted on social media on Saturday showed demonstrators holding signs that read: \u201cWell-behaved women don\u2019t make history\u201d and \u201cYou are never alone\u201d. Demonstrators also chanted: \u201cWe believe that we will win!\u201d and held other signs that read: \u201cWhere\u2019s my liberty when I have no choice?\u201d Republicans on Saturday appeared close to clinching control of the US House of Representatives, a critical element for Donald Trump to advance his agenda when the president-elect returns to the White House in January. With votes still being counted from the 5 November general election, Republicans had won 212 seats in the 435-member House, according to Edison Research, which projected on Friday night that Republican Jeff Hurd had enough votes to keep Republican control of Colorado\u2019s third congressional district. Democratic Representative Marie Gluesenkamp Perez won re-election to a US House seat representing Washington state on Saturday, the Associated Press reported, defeating Republican Joe Kent in a rematch of one of the closest races of 2022. Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 niece, Meena Harris, shared two photos on social media Saturday of her daughters \u2013 Harris\u2019 grandnieces \u2013 playing Connect Four, following the vice president\u2019s loss in the 2024 presidential election earlier this week. She captioned the post, \u201cBack to where it all began only a few months ago. My eternal gratitude to everyone who showed up. We love her so much.\u201d Voter rights groups on Saturday petitioned the Arizona supreme court to extend the deadline for voters to fix problems with their mail-in ballots following delays in vote counting and notifying voters about problems, the Associated Press reports. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Campaign Legal Center asked the state\u2019s high court in an emergency petition that the original 5 p.m. Sunday deadline be extended up to four days after a voter is sent notice of a problem. The groups argued in the petition that \u201ctens of thousands of Arizonans stand to be disenfranchised without any notice, let alone an opportunity to take action to ensure their ballots are counted.\u201d \u201cBecause these ballots have not even been processed, Respondents have not identified which ballots are defective and have not notified voters of the need to cure those defects,\u201d the petition stated. Arizona law says people who vote by mail should receive notice of problems with their ballots, such as a signature that doesn\u2019t match the one on file, and get a chance to correct it in a process known as \u201ccuring.\u201d The groups\u2019 petition noted that as of Friday evening more than 250,000 mail-in ballots had not yet been verified by signature. The bulk of them were in Arizona\u2019s most populous county, Maricopa County. Just under 200,000 early ballots remained to be processed as of Saturday, according to estimates on the Arizona secretary of state\u2019s Office website. Election officials in Maricopa did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Gluesenkamp Perez has balanced progressive policies with some measures popular with Republicans during her tenure, including securing the US-Mexico border \u2013 something she criticises Biden for failing to do \u2013 and introducing a constitutional amendment to force presidents to balance the budget. She supports abortion access and has hammered Kent, who previously has said he supported a national abortion ban, for changing his position after the supreme court overturned Roe v. Wade. Kent now says abortion laws should be left up to the states. Gluesenkamp Perez supports policies to counter climate change, but also speaks openly about being a gun owner. A top priority is pushing a \u201cright to repair\u201d bill that would help people get equipment fixed without having to pay exorbitant prices to the original manufacturer. Kent, a former Green Beret who has called for the impeachment of President Joe Biden, cited inflation and illegal immigration as top concerns. The two disagreed on a major local issue: the replacement of a major bridge across the Columbia River between Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, Washington. Gluesenkamp Perez supports plans to replace the existing bridge; Kent argued that a separate new bridge should be built while the old one is maintained. Here is more non Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, who has just won re-election to Washington State\u2019s third Congressional District. Via the Associated Press: Two years ago, Gluesenkamp Perez, who owns an auto-repair shop with her husband, came out of nowhere to win the seat, which hadn\u2019t been in Democratic hands for over a decade. She beat the Trump-endorsed Kent by fewer than 3,000 votes out of nearly 320,000 cast, making it one of the closest races in the country and setting the stage for a tough election fight this year. Her predecessor, Republican Jaime Herrera Beutler, held office for six terms but failed to survive the 2022 primary after voting to impeach Trump over the Jan. 6 insurrection. The district narrowly went for Trump in 2020, making it a crucial target for both parties this year. The race gained additional attention last week when an arson attack struck a ballot box in Vancouver \u2013 the district\u2019s biggest city \u2013 scorching hundreds of ballots. People who cast their votes in that box were urged to contact the county auditor\u2019s office to receive replacement ballots. Today so far Thanks for joining us today. Here is a summary of the latest developments on today\u2019s US politics blog: Joe Biden has invited Donald Trump to the Oval Office on Wednesday at 11am ET. The meeting will be the first between the current and former president after the 2024 election. Trump announced the formation of the Trump Vance Inaugural Committee, which will be chaired by real estate investor Steve Witkoff and former Georgia senator Kelly Loeffler. As the president-elect begins to select his cabinet, he shared on Truth Social today that the administration will not include either former UN ambassador Nikki Haley or former secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Thousands of New Yorkers gathered for the Protect Our Futures march, protesting Trump\u2019s re-election as president from outside Trump Tower, as more demonstrators gathered outside the offices of the Heritage Foundation (which authored the controversial Project 2025) in Washington DC. A Federal Emergency Management Agency employee was fired after she instructed her team to avoid dispatching aid to houses with Trump signs following Hurricane Milton. More than two months after the deadline to sign presidential transition paperwork passed, Trump\u2019s incoming administration still has not signed the agreement with the General Services Administration. The agreements coordinating the transition, which were due 1 September, mandate that the incoming president agree to an ethics plan and limit and disclose private donations. A record 13 women will lead their states as governor next year, breaking the previously held record of 12 set after the 2022 election. Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez has won reelection to Washington state\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, the Associated Press reports. Her victory gives the Democrats 201 House seats to Republicans\u2019 212 as the final votes are tallied to determine which party will control the House with 218 votes. Gluesenkamp Perez was first elected to the Senate two years ago when she won a close race for a seat that hadn\u2019t been held by a Democrat in more than a decade. Now that he has been re-elected, Donald Trump has a number of cabinet positions to fill \u2013 but his administration won\u2019t include either former UN ambassador Nikki Haley or former secretary of state Mike Pompeo, Trump said on Truth Social. As Real Clear Politics reports, it\u2019s looking increasingly likely Trump may nominate Richard Grenell as his secretary of state. The former US ambassador to Germany and previous acting director of national intelligence is seen as a Trump loyalist, although Tennessee senator Bill Hagerty and Florida senator Marco Rubio are also reportedly under consideration. If you\u2019re curious what Donald Trump\u2019s decisive victory says about the current faultlines in American politics, the Guardian\u2019s Richard Luscombe has reported on Trump\u2019s victory among Latino and Hispanic voters. Here\u2019s more: The raucous early morning celebration in Miami\u2019s Little Havana neighborhood was of a magnitude not seen since the Cuban dictator Fidel Castro died eight years previously. In the immigrant-saturated suburb of Westchester, too, Latinos partied beyond daybreak as Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House was confirmed. Wednesday morning\u2019s revelry in south Florida reflected a stunning victory for Trump in the previously solid blue, Hispanic-majority county of Miami-Dade that had not been won by a Republican presidential candidate in more than 30 years. His victory, fueled largely by support from Latino and Hispanic voters, particularly Latino men, was repeated in county after county in swing states as the Democrats\u2019 blue wall crumbled and it became clear Trump would once again be president. In Pennsylvania, hordes of Puerto Ricans who saw their homeland demeaned as a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally barely a week before, flocked to give him their vote. As it appears increasingly likely that Republicans will control the presidency, the Senate and the House, Democratic governors across the United States are drawing up plans to \u201cTrump-proof\u201d their states. California governor Gavin Newsom has drawn perhaps the most attention after tweeting a reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s election-night victory. Newsom has already called for the state legislature to hold a special session before Trump\u2019s inauguration. But Newsom is not the only Democratic governor preparing for Trump\u2019s second administration. Illinois governor JB Pritzker has spent the days since the election combing through Project 2025, and tells the Chicago Sun Times: \u201cYou come for my people, you come through me.\u201d Meanwhile, Massachusetts governor Maura Healey told MSNBC that her state\u2019s law enforcement will not assist in mass deportations if Trump orders them. More protesters are gathering in cities across the US to denounce Donald Trump\u2019s re-election. Although widespread, the protests are decidedly smaller than many that occured following the president-elect\u2019s first victory in 2016. Here\u2019s a sense of where demonstrations are taking place: Seattle Portland Denver Thousands of people gathered outside Trump Tower in New York today to protest against Donald Trump\u2019s re-election as president, while more gathered in Washington DC in response to fears that the new administration could further threaten abortion rights after Roe v Wade was overturned in 2022. Here\u2019s footage of the events: Protesters from the Women\u2019s March gathered outside the offices of the Heritage Foundation in Washington DC this afternoon to criticize the conservative thinktank that published Project 2025. The rally was organized to advocate for abortion access and \u201cas a chance to build community and power in the wake of the 2024 election\u201d, a Women\u2019s March spokesperson told CNN. The Women\u2019s March intends to hold another demonstration in Washington DC on 18 January, two days before Donald Trump will be inaugurated for his second term as president. Although all the votes are not yet counted in the tally for which party will control the House of Representatives, it\u2019s looking likely that Republicans will have a majority in the chamber. What\u2019s less clear is who will lead the party. Although current speaker Mike Johnson is seeking another term, Politico reports that some conservatives are looking for ways to signal their opposition to the current leader in a secret ballot next week. In lighter news, New Jersey senator-elect Andy Kim spent election night awaiting the results of his race in the hotel that his family lived in for several weeks after they moved to the state. Kim\u2019s win on Tuesday night will make him the first Korean American to serve in Congress. A Federal Emergency Management Agency employee has been fired after she instructed her team to avoid dispatching aid to houses with Donald Trump signs following Hurricane Milton. The Guardian\u2019s Joanna Walters reports: A employee at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) has been fired from her job and is being investigated because she told a disaster relief team she was directing in Florida after Hurricane Milton to avoid homes displaying election campaign signs supporting Donald Trump, conduct that the agency head on Saturday called \u201creprehensible\u201d. Deanne Criswell, the administrator of the federal agency, posted on X: \u201cMore than 22,000 Fema employees every day adhere to Fema\u2019s core values and are dedicated to helping people before, during and after disasters, often sacrificing time with their own families to help disaster survivors.\u201d She continued: \u201cRecently, a Fema employee departed from these values to advise her survivor assistance team not go to homes with yard signs supporting President-elect Trump. This is a clear violation of Fema\u2019s core values and principles to help people regardless of their political affiliation.\u201d For the full story, click here: Here are some images coming through the newswires of Saturday\u2019s protests across New York City led by various advocacy organizations in response to Donald Trump\u2019s re-election: Donald Trump has announced the formation of the Trump Vance Inaugural Committee, an organization that will \u201cplan inaugural events\u201d, the Trump-Vance campaign said in a statement on Saturday. The co-chairs of the committee have been announced as real estate investor Steve Witkoff and former Georgia senator Kelly Loeffler. \u201cOn election night, we made history and I have the extraordinary honor of having been elected the 47th President of the United States thanks to tens millions of hardworking Americans across the nation who supported our America First agenda. The Trump Vance Inaugural Committee will honor this magnificent victory in a celebration of the American people and our nation,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cThis will be the kick-off to my administration, which will deliver on bold promises to Make America Great Again. Together, we will celebrate this moment, steeped on history and tradition, and then get to work to achieve the most incredible future for our people, restoring strength, success, and common sense to the Oval Office,\u201d he added. With Donald Trump\u2019s re-election, the supreme court is once again in play. During Trump\u2019s first administration, the president-elect appointed three justices, which ultimately created the conservative majority that overturned Roe v Wade. As he returns to office, Trump could appoint new justices \u2013 especially if the aging conservative justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito retire. Senate Democrats are also currently debating whether to rush to replace liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor, who is 70, although they may struggle to confirm a replacement before Joe Biden leaves the White House. The US presidential election is already having international reverberations \u2013 from the war in Ukraine to global trade. One issue on many voters\u2019 minds: the war in Gaza. Here\u2019s Jason Burke with more about how the US elections could keep Benjamin Netanyahu in power until 2026: Benjamin Netanyahu is set to stay in power in Israel until elections due in 2026 and possibly longer, analysts and officials now believe, after a tumultuous week in which the 75-year-old veteran politician successfully fired his defence minister and was boosted by the results of the US election. Netanyahu\u2019s newly reinforced position could lead to further intensification of Israel\u2019s campaign in Lebanon, and prolong the conflict in Gaza, critics fear \u2013 although the incoming US president Donald Trump has said he wants to swiftly end both wars. Many observers have been surprised by the political resilience of Netanyahu, who is blamed by most Israelis for the failures that allowed Hamas to launch its bloody attacks into Israel last October, killing around 1,200 and taking more than 250 hostages. More than two months after the deadline to sign presidential transition paperwork passed, federal transition officials tell Politico that they expect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration will sign the agreement with the General Services Administration. The GSA coordinates the transition between incoming and outgoing presidential administrations, including by providing security clearances, briefings, access to federal facilities, documents and personnel. The agreements coordinating the transition, which were due 1 September, mandate that the incoming president agree to an ethics plan and limit and disclose private donations. As Politico reports, \u201crejecting help from GSA could have helped shield the federal government\u2019s access to [the Trump team\u2019s] materials. It also would have allowed them to accept unlimited sums of money for the transition without disclosing the identities of its donors.\u201d Thousands of New Yorkers have gathered for the Protect Our Futures march, protesting Donald Trump\u2019s re-election as president. Labor unions, immigrant rights groups and LGBTQ+ advocates held aloft a banner reading \u201cWe Won\u2019t Back Down\u201d as they marched outside the Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower in Columbus Circle this afternoon. Here\u2019s some footage from the ground: Although the US presidential election has been decided, votes are still being counted across the country \u2013 including in Arizona, where the tally will determine which candidate fills the state\u2019s open Senate seat. Here\u2019s Edward Helmore with more: Arizona remained in a tense waiting game on Saturday for its election results, even as neighboring Nevada declared for Donald Trump overnight, giving the president-elect six out of seven swing states after election day on 5 November. In Arizona, official tallies were 83% complete by mid-morning on Saturday with Trump leading at 52.7% and Harris at 46%, or about 180,000 votes ahead. But enough ballots remain uncounted \u2013 602,000 as of late Friday night \u2013 for the state to remain undeclared. The state sensationally flipped to Joe Biden and the Democrats in 2020. In the key US Senate race there between Republican Kari Lake and Democrat Ruben Gallego, the controversial Lake, who always denied that Biden won the White House fairly in 2020, was trailing the Democrat 48.5% to 49.5%, or by around 33,000 votes, mid-morning on Saturday. A record 13 women will lead their states as governor next year, breaking the previously held record of 12 set after the 2022 election. The news comes as former senator Kelly Ayotte is elected as New Hampshire\u2019s governor \u2013 in a race where a win by either her or her opponent, Joyce Craig, would have set the new record. The victory for women\u2019s leadership comes in the same election where voters chose Donald Trump over a female presidential candidate for the second time. To date, 18 states still have never had a woman hold the role of governor. Hundreds of protesters are gathering in New York City this afternoon for the Protect Our Futures march, in response to the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. The rally, which is gathering in Columbus Circle, was organized by workers\u2019 rights groups like the Working Families Party, the Communications Workers of America and Indivisible \u2013 as well as immigrant justice organizations like Make the Road NY. In an invitation to the march, organizers wrote: \u201cNew York has a crucial role to play in setting the tone for the next four years. It is critical to make clear that New Yorkers will continue to stand together, in community, against the danger to come.\u201d Here\u2019s some footage as protesters begin gathering, including advocates from Make the Road NY chanting: \u201cEstamos en la lucha\u201d (we are in the fight), activists with Jews for Racial and Economic Justice singing a nigun as they march, and members of the City University of New York\u2019s faculty and staff union holding aloft red \u201cSolidarity\u201d signs. Donald Trump\u2019s advisers are evaluating methods to carry out the president-elect\u2019s promised \u201clargest deportation\u201d in US history, the Wall Street Journal reports. Currently, the incoming administration is considering issuing a national emergency declaration, which could allow Trump to use Pentagon funds, military facilities for detention and military planes for deportations. The administration is reportedly also assessing ways to encourage immigrants to leave voluntarily, perhaps by waiving a 10-year bar on re-entry. A recent estimate from the American Immigration Council predicted that mass deportations of the current number of undocumented immigrants in the US could cost $968bn over more than a decade. As Trump decides who to appoint to his new administration, Tom Homan, acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump\u2019s first term, and Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump\u2019s \u201cMuslim ban\u201d, are likely to play important roles. As results continue to roll in from the 2024 elections, data shows that the Republican party picked up seats all across the country \u2013 even in the deeply Democratic stronghold of New York City. Here\u2019s Adam Gabbatt with more on why: Every single county in the New York City metropolitan area swung towards Trump compared with four years ago, Gothamist reported. It\u2019s a staggering shift for a multicultural, heavily Democratic city, given the divisive and racist nature of Trump\u2019s campaign. But it shouldn\u2019t have come as a huge surprise to Democrats, said Lawrence Levy, former chief political columnist for Newsday and executive dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University. \u201cSomething started happening in 2021,\u201d Levy said. \u201cThis did not come out of the blue.\u201d That year, New York City politics started seeing some reactions to \u201cpost-pandemic pain\u201d, Levy said, as some voters from demographics including the white, Latino and Asian communities shifted away from Democrats in local elections. In the 2022 midterm elections, New York City retained its Democratic members of the House of Representatives, but some suburban voters to the north and east of the city elected Republicans. \u201cThe question is: what does this all mean?\u201d Levy said. Joe Biden has invited Donald Trump to the Oval Office on Wednesday at 11am ET, according to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. The meeting will be the first between the current and former president after the 2024 election. Here\u2019s more on the presidential transition as it gets under way: Democratic senator Bob Casey has not yet conceded his race for re-election in Pennsylvania \u2013 although the Associated Press called the race for his opponent two days ago. Casey ran against Republican David McCormick, a former hedge fund CEO, in a hotly contested race that ranked as one of the Senate\u2019s most expensive, with the campaigns and their allies spending more than $300m on ads. As Joan E Greve writes, When the AP called the race at 4.09pm ET on Thursday, two days after polls closed in Pennsylvania, McCormick led by 0.5 points. The narrow margin raised the possibility of a recount, although Casey faces an uphill climb in overcoming McCormick\u2019s lead of roughly 30,000 votes. After the AP called the race, the Pennsylvania department of state announced that at least 100,000 ballots remained uncounted, boosting the Casey team\u2019s hopes of a last-minute surge. Here is a summary of the latest developments so far on today\u2019s US politics blog: Donald Trump won his sixth battleground state of the 2024 election early on Saturday, beating Kamala Harris in Nevada. The AP declared Trump the winner after concluding there were not enough uncounted ballots in the state\u2019s strongest Democratic areas to overcome the former president\u2019s 46,000-vote lead over the Democratic nominee. Only Arizona remains to be called. Nevada Democratic senator Jacky Rosen has won re-election, beating Republican Sam Brown in a tight but unusually quiet race for the battleground state. \u201cThank you, Nevada! I\u2019m honored and grateful to continue serving as your United States senator,\u201d Rosen said on Friday on the social platform X. Joe Biden\u2019s slowness in exiting the 2024 presidential election cost the Democrats dearly, the former House speaker Nancy Pelosi said, days after Harris was beaten by Trump. \u201cHad the president gotten out sooner, there may have been other candidates in the race. The anticipation was that, if the president were to step aside, that there would be an open primary,\u201d Pelosi remarked in The Interview, a New York Times podcast. Officials at the Pentagon are having informal discussions about what to do if Trump were to give an illegal order, such as deploying the military domestically, according to a report from CNN. They are also preparing for the possibility that he may change rules to be able to fire scores of career civil servants. The US justice department is bringing criminal charges over an Iranian plot to kill Trump that was thwarted by the FBI, the government said. The federal government has unsealed criminal charges in what the justice department said was a murder-for-hire plan to take out Trump before this week\u2019s presidential election. Russia is open to hearing Trump\u2019s proposals on ending the war, an official said on Saturday, as a Russian drone killed one person and injured 13 in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa and the EU foreign policy chief held talks in Kyiv. Sergei Ryabkov, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister, said Moscow and Washington were \u201cexchanging signals\u201d on Ukraine via \u201cclosed channels\u201d, according to AP. He did not specify whether the communication was with the current administration or Trump and members of his incoming administration. Bryan Lanza, a Republican party strategist and senior adviser to Trump suggested, in an interview with the BBC, that the Trump administration will focus on securing an end to the war in Ukraine \u2013 rather than trying to help Kyiv regain territory. Federal transition officials have said they expect Trump\u2019s team to sign an agreement to accept their help with preparations for the new administration, reports Politico, citing three people with knowledge of the discussions. However, it\u2019s unclear if an agreement has been signed yet, says Politico. Iran on Saturday urged Trump to reconsider the \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy he pursued against Tehran during his first term. \u201cTrump must show that he is not following the wrong policies of the past,\u201d the Iranian vice-president for strategic affairs, Mohammad Javad Zarif, told reporters on Saturday. Just hours after Trump\u2019s election win on Tuesday, Black people across the US reported receiving racist text messages telling them that they had been \u201cselected\u201d to pick cotton and needed to report to \u201cthe nearest plantation\u201d. While the texts, some of which were signed \u201ca Trump supporter\u201d, varied in detail, they all conveyed the same essential message about being selected to pick cotton. Some of the messages refer to the recipients by name. Harris received at least 22,000 fewer votes than Biden did four years ago in Michigan\u2019s most heavily Arab American and Muslim cities, a Guardian analysis of raw vote data in the critical swing state finds. The numbers also show Trump made small gains \u2013 about 9,000 votes \u2013 across those areas, suggesting Harris\u2019s loss there is more attributable to Arab Americans either not voting or casting ballots for third-party candidates. Barack Obama\u2019s former speechwriter said during an episode of the Pod Save America podcast that Biden\u2019s internal polling showed Trump winning \u201c400 electoral votes\u201d, reports the Hill. Jon Favreau, a host of the podcast, said on Friday\u2019s episode, that Biden\u2019s re-election attempt was a \u201ccatastrophic mistake\u201d. Inflation and immigration emerged as the dominant themes in this year\u2019s presidential race. But democracy was also prominent in the minds of voters. Early exit polls on Tuesday night showed democracy as one of the most important issues on voters\u2019 minds after the economy \u2013 and both Republican and Democratic voters had concerns. In its VoteCast survey, half of the 120,000 voters polled by the AP said democracy was their single most important motivating factor for how they voted. Anti-abortion advocates say there is still work to be done to further restrict access to abortion when Trump returns to the White House next year. \u201cNow the work begins to dismantle the pro-abortion policies of the Biden-Harris administration,\u201d the Susan B Anthony List, the powerful anti-abortion lobby, said in a statement on Wednesday. The group added: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s first-term pro-life accomplishments are the baseline for his second term.\u201d The group declined to release details about what, specifically, they will seek to undo. The Iraqi prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, expressed hopes during a phone call with Trump that he would keep his \u201cpromises to work towards ending wars\u201d in the Middle East. In the phone call, the Iraqi premier pointed to Trump\u2019s \u201ccampaign statements and promises to work towards ending wars in the region\u201d, a statement from Sudani\u2019s office said late on Friday. Millions of Americans are at risk of losing health coverage in 2025 under Trump\u2019s forthcoming administration. More than 20 million Americans rely on the individual private health insurance market for healthcare, private insurance which is subsidized by the federal government. The judge overseeing Trump\u2019s 2020 election interference case canceled any remaining court deadlines on Friday while prosecutors assess the \u201cthe appropriate course going forward\u201d in light of the Republican\u2019s presidential victory, reports the Associated Press. Bomb threats were made against several Maryland boards of elections and election offices in at least two California counties on Friday, state authorities said, adding that everyone was safe and law enforcement officials were investigating. Nigel Farage has said he could be \u201cuseful as an interlocutor\u201d between the UK\u2019s Labour government and Trump. The Reform UK leader said he has \u201cgot a great relationship\u201d with the president-elect and also knows people he believes will be in Trump\u2019s administration for \u201cquite a long time\u201d. Speaking to the PA news agency at a Reform event in Exeter, Farage described Trump as a \u201cpro-British American president\u201d who gives the UK \u201cpotentially huge opportunities if we can overcome the difficulties that the whole of the cabinet have been rude about him\u201d. Ed Davey has urged UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, to \u201cTrump-proof\u201d the UK by urgently seeking closer European cooperation over military aid for Ukraine and economic ties, after the US president-elect\u2019s threats about security and trade wars. The Liberal Democrat leader, whose party is the third biggest in the House of Commons, argued that while the UK government should seek to work with a Trump administration, it should also be as prepared as possible if he were to abandon Ukraine or impose sweeping tariffs. Russia is open to hearing Donald Trump\u2019s proposals on ending the war, an official said on Saturday, as a Russian drone killed one person and wounded 13 in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa and the European Union foreign policy chief held talks in Kyiv. Sergei Ryabkov, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister, said Moscow and Washington were \u201cexchanging signals\u201d on Ukraine via \u201cclosed channels\u201d, according to the AP. He did not specify whether the communication was with the current administration or Trump and members of his incoming administration. Russia\u2019s readiness depends on whether Trump\u2019s proposals are \u201cideas on how to move forward in the area of settlement, and not in the area of further pumping the Kyiv regime with all kinds of aid\u201d, Ryabkov said on Saturday in an interview with Russian state news agency Interfax. In Kyiv, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, told reporters that Ukraine is ready to work with the Trump administration. \u201cRemember that President Zelenskyy was one of the first world leaders \u2026 to greet president Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a sincere conversation [and] an exchange of thoughts regarding further cooperation.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s US election victory was fueled largely by the support from Latino and Hispanic voters, particularly Latino men, that was repeated in county after county in swing states elsewhere as the Democratic party\u2019s blue wall crumbled and the former president was elected to also be the next. In Pennsylvania, Puerto Ricans who saw their homeland demeaned as a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally, barely a week before the election, flocked to give him their vote. In Wisconsin, exit polls showed a six-point rise from 2020, to 43%, in Trump\u2019s Hispanic support, despite his condemnation of certain immigrants as \u201cdrug dealers\u201d, \u201cmurderers\u201d and \u201crapists\u201d, and promise to conduct the largest deportation effort in US history soon after he takes office. And among other minority groups, Arab and Muslim Americans in Michigan also seemed able to overlook Trump\u2019s full-throated support of Israel\u2019s military onslaught in Gaza to show up for him in large numbers. In large part, that move was as much an effort to vote against Kamala Harris as many in the Arab and Muslim American communities have expressed anger with the Biden administration \u2013 and, by extension, Harris \u2013 for its support for Israel. Analysts, while noting that the election was only a few days ago and a full picture of voting patterns has yet to emerge, suggest a multitude of reasons why a candidate so openly hostile to immigrants would be championed by them in such large numbers. Fault, they say, can be attributed to Democrats\u2019 failure to understand the nuances of the Hispanic and Latino voting populations. There were clear signs as early as January that then candidate Joe Biden\u2019s support from that demographic had cratered, and Trump\u2019s was rising. Ultimately, it was Republicans\u2019 economic messaging that broke through most, several experts said. That was then combined with an admiration for Trump\u2019s bombastic and pugnacious style among Latino men who, as much as white men and women who form his base, have no problem with his insults, racism and threats, because they don\u2019t believe he is talking about them. \u201cThere seems to be an attraction to Trump among Latinos, Latino men, that could be a kind of defensive reaction to his aggression and aggressive rhetoric,\u201d said Guillermo Grenier, professor of sociology at Florida International University and the co-author of the book This Land Is Our Land: Newcomers and Established Residents in Miami. \u201cIt could be they\u2019re saying: \u2018I\u2019m not one of them, you know? I\u2019m an American citizen, I\u2019m voting for you, I\u2019m not the rapist scum, I\u2019m not with them. That\u2019s the other guys, the other immigrants, not the voting immigrants.\u2019\u201d Nigel Farage has said he could be \u201cuseful as an interlocutor\u201d between the UK\u2019s Labour government and Donald Trump, reports the Press Association (PA). The Reform UK leader said he has \u201cgot a great relationship\u201d with the president-elect and also knows people he believes will be in Trump\u2019s administration for \u201cquite a long time\u201d. Speaking to the PA news agency at a Reform event in Exeter, Farage described Trump as a \u201cpro-British American president\u201d who gives the UK \u201cpotentially huge opportunities if we can overcome the difficulties that the whole of the cabinet have been rude about him\u201d. The UK\u2019s prime minister, Keir Starmer, and the government will be keen to build bridges with Trump ahead of him returning to the White House after a row over Labour activists campaigning for Kamala Harris, and controversy over comments previously made by foreign secretary, David Lammy. Farage told PA: I\u2019ve got a great relationship with Donald Trump but equally I know many of the other senior figures who will be in this administration and I\u2019ve known them for quite a long time. It seems to me that with a Labour party and a Republican party who disagree on so many things \u2013 who are such fundamentally different people \u2013 that I might be useful as an interlocutor. Unofficially, behind the scenes, to try and help mend some of those fences. If the [UK] government choose to use me, I would do that not because I support the Labour government but because I believe in something called the national interest.\u201d On Friday, Farage said the UK should \u201croll out the red carpet\u201d for Trump. He said: Whether you like Trump or not, this is the important point that in terms of intelligence sharing, in terms of defence, in terms of investment, in terms of trade, America is our most important relationship. Federal transition officials have said they expect Donald Trump\u2019s team to sign an agreement to accept their help with preparations for the new administration, reports Politico, citing three people with knowledge of the discussions. However, it\u2019s unclear if an agreement has been signed yet, says Politico. It comes after reports that the traditional system of seeking support from the General Services Administration (GSA) would be avoided. \u201cThe Trump-Vance transition lawyers continue to constructively engage with the Biden-Harris administration lawyers regarding all agreements contemplated by the Presidential Transition Act,\u201d Trump transition spokesperson Brian Hughes said in a statement, according to Politico. \u201cWe will update you once a decision is made.\u201d Barack Obama\u2019s former speechwriter said during an episode of the Pod Save America podcast that Joe Biden\u2019s internal polling showed president-elect Donald Trump winning \u201c400 electoral votes\u201d, reports the Hill. According to the US political website, Jon Favreau, a host of the podcast, said on Friday\u2019s episode: Then we find out when the Biden campaign becomes the Harris campaign, that the Biden campaign\u2019s own internal polling at the time when they were telling us he was the strongest candidate, showed that Donald Trump was going to win 400 electoral votes. Favreau described Biden\u2019s re-election attempt as a \u201ccatastrophic mistake\u201d. He also said Biden\u2019s \u201cinner circle\u201d refused to believe he was \u201cunpopular\u201d, according to the Hill. \u201cThey refuse to acknowledge until very late that anyone could be upset about inflation. And they just kept telling us that his presidency was historic and it was the greatest economy ever,\u201d Favreau was quoted as saying. The Hill said they had contacted the White House press office for comment. The party was buzzing, the confidence was surging and Kenneth Stewart was riding the Trump train. \u201cHe\u2019s masculine,\u201d explained Stewart, an African American man from Chicago. \u201cHe brings a lot of energy. He talks about things that we can understand. He talks about building. He talks about the auto industry. He talks about a lot of stuff that people in the Rust belt care about.\u201d Stewart was a guest at Donald Trump\u2019s election watch event in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday night and celebrated his victory over the Democratic vice-president, Kamala Harris. The result said much about gender, race and the new media landscape. It also represented a populist backlash against America\u2019s perceived elites. In the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, millions felt a distrust of authorities who ordered them to wear masks, close schools and go into lockdown. They felt frustrated by post-pandemic inflation that pushed up the prices of groceries and petrol. They felt they would never be able to buy a house, that the American dream was slipping away. They were looking for someone to blame \u2013 and for a champion who could fix it. They believed they found him in Trump and, despite his two impeachments and 34 criminal convictions, returned him to power. He made gains among nearly every demographic group. In part he was riding a wave of anti-incumbency fervour that has swept through major democracies, battering the left and the right in the aftershocks of the pandemic. That will provide little comfort to Democrats, who raised a billion dollars yet lost the national popular vote. They have come to be seen as the party of the highly educated who earn more than $100,000 a year and live in big cities such as New York and Washington. They are perceived as out of tune with people who work with their hands and shower after work instead of before. Stewart said on Tuesday night: The other side, they\u2019re only talking about feelings. They\u2019re talking about Trump\u2019s bad. But come to me with tangibles. A lot of Black men just want tangibles. We just want jobs. We want to see what our fathers had. We want to see what our grandfathers had, especially in the Rust belt. America is a nation of cavernous inequality with few safety nets. The last populist convulsion came 15 years ago after the Great Recession. On the left it spawned Occupy Wall Street, a response to economic inequality, corporate greed and the influence of money in politics. On the right it gave rise to the Tea Party, fuelled by rage against elites, distrust in government and racial hostility to President Barack Obama. The Democratic and Republican parties each absorbed these movements into their political DNA. They manifested in the 2016 presidential election when the harmful effects of globalisation, trade and deindustrialisation took centre age. Leftwing senator Bernie Sanders drew huge crowds in Democratic primary but lost, while non-politician Trump drew huge crowds in the Republican primary and won. Inflation and immigration emerged as the dominant themes in this year\u2019s presidential race. But democracy was also prominent in the minds of voters. Early exit polls on Tuesday night showed democracy as one of the most important issues on voters\u2019 minds after the economy \u2013 and both Republican and Democratic voters had concerns. In its VoteCast survey, half of the 120,000 voters polled by AP said democracy was their single most important motivating factor for how they voted. But supporters of Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump saw the issue from different perspectives. They differed over why they\u2019re worried about democracy and who\u2019s responsible for the threat. During the campaign, Harris repeatedly warned of the dangers Trump poses to US democracy. Harris denounced Trump as a \u201cfascist\u201d who wants \u201cunchecked power\u201d and a military personally loyal to him after allegations emerged about the former president\u2019s repeatedly voiced admiration for Hitler. Trump also used his rallies to paint Democrats as a threat to democracy \u2013 repeatedly calling Harris and senior Democrats radical leftists and Marxists. It appears that message got through to his base. About one-third of his supporters said democracy was the most important factor for their vote. About eight in 10 Trump voters felt electing Harris would bring the country closer to authoritarianism. \u201cDemocracy voters\u201d who supported Harris and Trump were equally concerned that the opposing candidate\u2019s views were too extreme. The BBC has published an interview with Bryan Lanza, a Republican party strategist and senior adviser to Donald Trump. In it, Lanza suggests the Trump administration will focus on securing an end to the war in Ukraine \u2013 rather than trying to help Kyiv regain territory. Lanza said Zelenskyy would be asked to provide a \u201crealistic vision for peace\u201d, adding: And if president Zelenskyy comes to the table and says, well we can only have peace if we have Crimea, he shows to us that he\u2019s not serious. Later, he said: When Zelenskyy says we will only stop this fighting, there will only be peace once Crimea is returned, we\u2019ve got news for president Zelenskyy: Crimea is gone. And if that is your priority of getting Crimea back and having American soldiers fight to get Crimea back, you\u2019re on your own. UK prime minister Keir Starmer is being urged to consider an emergency cash injection into defence and to accelerate Britain\u2019s planned review of its military capabilities before Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House. Senior defence figures are now assessing how Trump\u2019s victory will shape a strategic defence review (SDR) that was already under way in Whitehall, whose findings are due to be reported in the spring. The SDR comes alongside a crucial review of public spending. However, Starmer and chancellor Rachel Reeves are already facing calls to think again about the immediate funding allocated to defence, amid concerns that a clear plan for the military\u2019s future may not be in place until next summer. Starmer\u2019s commitment to spend 2.5% of GDP on defence when economic conditions allow remains unfunded since the budget. Meanwhile, a \u00a317bn shortfall in the budget for new weapons and equipment over the next 10 years has already been identified by the National Audit Office. Admiral Lord West, a former chief of the naval staff who served as Labour\u2019s security minister under Gordon Brown, told the Observer that Trump\u2019s election created a chance to demonstrate Britain\u2019s willingness to step up on defence, amid the incoming US president\u2019s criticism that European nations have failed to prioritise it. \u201cI see it as an opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is understandable, given the politics, to do a strategic defence review. But if you\u2019re going to match what\u2019s required for the security of this nation, it will inevitably mean a need for more money. So why don\u2019t we now bite the bullet and go down that road? \u201cHistorically, we\u2019ve done better than most European countries and Trump knows that. We can set an example. We could show we\u2019re going to move straight towards 3% [of GDP spent on defence] because we want to show everyone the way. This would be a big tick in the box, Trump would be on side, and there will be lots of benefits.\u201d Donald Trump won his sixth battleground state of the 2024 election early on Saturday, beating Kamala Harris in Nevada. The AP declared Trump the winner after concluding there were not enough uncounted ballots in the state\u2019s strongest Democratic areas to overcome the former president\u2019s 46,000-vote lead over the Democratic nominee. Trump clinched a second term early on Wednesday when Wisconsin pushed him past the 270 electoral votes needed to win, so Nevada\u2019s six electoral votes only added to the size of his victory. He now has 301 electoral votes and has won six of the seven battleground states. Only Arizona remains to be called. The AP only declares a winner once it can determine that a trailing candidate can\u2019t close the gap and overtake the vote leader. Kamala Harris received at least 22,000 fewer votes than Joe Biden did four years ago in Michigan\u2019s most heavily Arab American and Muslim cities, a Guardian analysis of raw vote data in the critical swing state finds. The numbers also show Trump made small gains \u2013 about 9,000 votes \u2013 across those areas, suggesting Harris\u2019s loss there is more attributable to Arab Americans either not voting or casting ballots for third-party candidates. Support for Democrats also fell in seven precincts around the country with significant Arab American or Muslim populations, according to data compiled by the Arab American Institute. It found a combined drop in the seven precincts, from about 4,900 votes in 2020 to just 3,400 this election. Another analysis, based on nationwide exit polling by the Council on American Islamic Relations, found 53% of Muslim Americans voted for Jill Stein. The same poll showed 21% of Muslims cast a ballot for Trump and 20.3% for Harris. The drop in Democratic support in Hamtramck, Dearborn and Dearborn Heights \u2013 three Michigan cities with the nation\u2019s largest Arab American and Muslim populations per capita \u2013 represent nearly 27% of the 81,000-vote difference between Harris and Donald Trump\u2019s tallies in the state. Read on here: Iran on Saturday urged US president-elect Donald Trump to reconsider the \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy he pursued against Tehran during his first term, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cTrump must show that he is not following the wrong policies of the past,\u201d Iranian vice-president for strategic affairs, Mohammad Javad Zarif, told reporters on Saturday. Zarif, a veteran diplomat who previously served as Iran\u2019s foreign minister, helped seal the 2015 nuclear accord between Tehran and western powers, including the US. The deal however was torpedoed in 2018 after the US unilaterally withdrew from it under Trump, who later reimposed sanctions on Tehran. In response, Iran rolled back its obligations under the deal and has since enriched uranium up to 60%, just 30% lower than nuclear-grade. Tehran has repeatedly denied western countries\u2019 accusations that it is seeking to develop a nuclear weapon. AFP reports that Zarif also said on Saturday that Trump\u2019s political approach towards Iran led to the increase in enrichment levels. \u201cHe must have realised that the maximum pressure policy that he initiated caused Iran\u2019s enrichment to reach 60% from 3.5%,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a man of calculation, he should do the math and see what the advantages and disadvantages of this policy have been and whether he wants to continue or change this harmful policy,\u201d Zarif added. Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baghaei, on Thursday said he hoped the president-elect\u2019s return to the White House would allow Washington to \u201crevise the wrong approaches of the past\u201d \u2013 however stopping short of mentioning Trump\u2019s name. On Tuesday, Trump told reporters he was \u201cnot looking to do damage to Iran\u201d. \u201cMy terms are very easy. They can\u2019t have a nuclear weapon. I\u2019d like them to be a very successful country,\u201d he said after he cast his ballot. As Donald Trump watched election results roll in from a party at his Mar-a-Lago compound, Elon Musk sat arm\u2019s length away, basking in the impending victory he had helped secure. In less than five months, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO had gone from not endorsing a candidate to becoming a fixture of the president-elect\u2019s inner circle. \u201cThe future is gonna be so \ud83d\udd25 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8,\u201d Musk posted to his social media platform, X, just after midnight, along with a photo of himself leaning over to talk with Trump at the Mar-a-Lago dinner. Musk\u2019s place at the head table was the result of months of political efforts by the world\u2019s richest man, and an injection of at least $130m of his own money. Musk campaigned for Trump both online and offline, funded advertising and get-out-the-vote operations for a campaign at a severe financial disadvantage to its opponent. He even temporarily decamped from his home in Texas to the swing state of Pennsylvania, where he appeared at town hall events and held a $1m daily giveaway for voters. Musk wasn\u2019t the only billionaire rooting for Trump. But unlike some of his peers, who preferred operating in the shadows, shielded by Super Pacs and meetings behind closed doors, he became Trump\u2019s most visible surrogate. As so often with his endeavors, Musk was all in. And now, gambling on becoming one of Trump\u2019s most vocal and deep-pocketed supporters has won Musk direct influence and access to the nation\u2019s highest office, making him not only the world\u2019s richest man but also one of its most politically powerful. Musk\u2019s exact role in the coming administration is still unclear. Trump has previously said that the CEO would lead a full audit of the federal government, and make drastic reforms as \u201csecretary of cost-cutting\u201d. Any such position would create immense conflicts of interest, as Musk\u2019s companies hold billions in contracts with the government and are also facing investigations from federal agencies. Under Trump, who has long opposed regulators and ignored ethical conflicts, that may not matter. Musk\u2019s fortune soared by $26bn just two days after the election. Beyond any potential formal government role, Musk has also ingratiated himself as a close ally of the president-elect \u2013 who adopted some of Musk\u2019s policy suggestions during the campaign and praised him as a \u201csuper genius\u201d during his victory speech. He reportedly joined Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on Wednesday, signaling broad influence. At 2.25am, Donald Trump gazed out at his jubilant supporters wearing \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats. He was surrounded by his wife, Melania, and his children, the Stars and Stripes and giant banners that proclaimed: \u201cDream big again\u201d and \u201cTrump will fix it!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to help our country heal,\u201d Trump vowed. \u201cWe have a country that needs help and it needs help very badly. We\u2019re going to fix our borders, we\u2019re going to fix everything about our country and we\u2019ve made history for a reason tonight, and the reason is going to be just that.\u201d Having risen from the political dead, the president-elect was already looking ahead to what he called the \u201cgolden age of America\u201d \u2013 a country that had just shifted sharply to the right. And at its core was the promise of Trump unleashed: a radical expansion of presidential power. The 45th and 47th commander-in-chief will face fewer limits on his ambition when he is sworn in again in January. He returns as the head of a Republican party remade in his image over the past decade and as the architect of a right-leaning judiciary that helped eliminate his legal perils. Second time around, he has allies across Washington ready to enforce his will. Kurt Bardella, a Democratic strategist and former Republican congressional aide, said: What we\u2019re going to have is an imperial presidency. This is going to be probably the most powerful presidency in terms of centralising power and wielding power that we\u2019ve had probably since FDR [Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was president from 1933 until his death in 1945].\u201d The judge overseeing Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 election interference case canceled any remaining court deadlines on Friday while prosecutors assess the \u201cthe appropriate course going forward\u201d in light of the Republican\u2019s presidential victory, reports the Associated Press (AP). Special counsel Jack Smith charged Trump last year with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. But Smith\u2019s team has been evaluating how to wind down the two federal cases before the president-elect takes office because of longstanding Justice Department policy that says sitting presidents cannot be prosecuted, a person familiar with the matter told the AP. Trump\u2019s victory over vice-president Kamala Harris means that the Justice Department believes he can no longer face prosecution in accordance with department legal opinions meant to shield presidents from criminal charges while in office. Trump has criticized both cases as politically motivated, and has said he would fire Smith \u201cwithin two seconds\u201d of taking office. The AP reports that in a court filing on Friday in the 2020 election case, Smith\u2019s team asked to cancel any upcoming court deadlines, saying it needs \u201ctime to assess this unprecedented circumstance and determine the appropriate course going forward consistent with Department of Justice policy.\u201d Anti-abortion advocates say there is still work to be done to further restrict access to abortion when Republican Donald Trump returns to the White House next year, reports Associated Press (AP). They point to the federal guidance that the administration of Democratic president Joe Biden released around emergency abortions, requiring that hospitals provide them for women whose health or life is at risk, and its easing of prescribing restrictions for abortion pills that have allowed women to order the medication online with the click of a button. \u201cNow the work begins to dismantle the pro-abortion policies of the Biden-Harris administration,\u201d the Susan B Anthony List, the powerful anti-abortion lobby, said in a statement on Wednesday. The group added: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s first-term pro-life accomplishments are the baseline for his second term.\u201d The group declined to release details about what, specifically, they will seek to undo, reports the AP. But abortion rights advocates are bracing for further abortion restrictions once Trump takes office. And some women are, too, with online abortion pill orders spiking in the days after election day. Trump has said abortion is an issue for the states, not the federal government. Yet, during the campaign, he pointedly noted that he appointed justices to the supreme court who were in the majority when striking down the national right to abortion. There are also things his administration can do, from picking judges to issuing regulations, to further an anti-abortion agenda. In the first Trump term Richard Moore, then the political director of the UK Foreign Office and now the head of MI6, admitted half of Britain\u2019s diplomats woke up each morning dreading what they might read on the president\u2019s Twitter feed. The sheer unpredictability of Trump\u2019s caprice, and his faith in his quixotic charisma, made it hard for diplomats to operate. It would often taken feverish consultations with Trump\u2019s senior aides, including some in the Pentagon, before a plan \u2013 such as a premature withdrawal of 2,500 US troops from Afghanistan \u2013 could be finessed. Now, for all the pro-forma congratulations, that sense of foreboding is back. Although only 4% of the American electorate said foreign policy was the most important issue to them in the election, for those watching from abroad it was the all-consuming preoccupation. That is hardly surprising, as Trump represents an injection of highly combustible material into an already explosive world. Two wars are raging, one now including North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia, and the other still capable of pitting Iran against Israel. And a third with China is looming. In the eyes of Republican foreign policy thinkers, that is at least two wars too many. Yet, extraordinarily, Trump\u2019s campaign left few clues as to how he would conduct foreign policy. Often the proposals he referenced were mere headlines \u2013 such as ending the war in Ukraine in 24 hours; outlandish, such as deporting 10 million migrants; or contradictory, concerning committing to Nato and suggesting Russia does whatever it wants to European freeloaders. Apart from that, there is a broad intent to make tariffs as much as sanctions the central part of the US foreign policy armoury. Donald is not the only Trump back in the picture after his election win. On Tuesday night, members of the former and future president\u2019s family posed with him at his Florida estate in celebration of his re-election. \u201cDad, we are so proud of you,\u201d wrote Tiffany, Trump\u2019s younger daughter, posting the photo on X. It was also shared by his 17-year-old granddaughter, Kai, captioned: \u201cThe whole squad.\u201d Notably absent was the former first lady, Melania. However, the happy family shot did include Elon Musk \u2013 not a blood relative but surely now loved by the president-elect like a son \u2013 who was holding X-AE-AXii, the most absurdly named of his own 12 children. Given the prominent roles, official and unofficial, held by Trump\u2019s children and their spouses in his first administration, it is a safe bet that family members will be front and centre in his second. Here is a reminder of the characters likely to feature in the Trump dynasty, season two: Jacky Rosen, a former Las Vegas-area synagogue president and computer programmer, ran ads touting herself as an independent who doesn\u2019t listen to \u201cparty leaders\u201d, reports the AP. Sam Brown had Donald Trump\u2019s support in the Republican primary and won easily, but he was significantly outspent during the campaign, leaving Rosen to dominate the airwaves for months. Analysts note that Nevada has a history of backing no-nonsense senators who deliver funding from Washington. According to the AP, Rosen also spotlighted her work on expanding broadband internet access and helping to connect Las Vegas with Southern California via light rail. And she hammered Brown for his opposition to abortion rights, saying he would support a national abortion ban despite Brown\u2019s statements that he respects Nevada voters\u2019 choice decades ago to legalize abortions. A ballot measure this year that would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution passed. Voters must again approve it in 2026 in order to amend the constitution. The Senate contest drew relatively little national interest for most of the campaign, a striking contrast with the presidential race as both Trump and vice-president, Kamala Harris, targeted the state and its six electoral votes. Conservative money flowed in during the final days as the GOP posted a strong showing in early period, but Brown was unable to fully fight back. Brown previously made an unsuccessful bid in 2022 for the Republican nomination to face Cortez Masto. All four of Nevada\u2019s US House incumbents \u2013 three Democrats and one Republican \u2013 also won reelection this year. Nevada Democratic senator Jacky Rosen has won reelection, beating Republican Sam Brown in a tight but unusually quiet race for the battleground state, reports the Associated Press (AP). According to the AP, the first-term senator had campaigned on abortion rights and positioned herself as a nonideological politician, a formula that also worked for the state\u2019s senior senator, Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto, in her own reelection bid two years ago. \u201cThank you, Nevada! I\u2019m honored and grateful to continue serving as your United States senator,\u201d Rosen said Friday on the social platform X. Brown, a retired army captain who moved to Nevada from Texas in 2018 and has never held elected office, unsuccessfully tried to ride president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s strong showing in the working-class state. Trump won Nevada on Friday. The Associated Press left phone and emailed messages seeking comment on Friday from Brown\u2019s campaign. Just before Rosen won, Brown said on X that it was unacceptable that votes were still being counted in Nevada days after the election. \u201cWe deserve to know election results within hours, not a week later,\u201d he said. The former US president Donald Trump, due to return to the White House in January, has not yet engaged in formal discussions regarding his new cabinet. Nevertheless, amid his plane journeys, television appearances and rallies, speculation and rumours have swirled around several figures who could find roles in his administration. My colleagues have taken a look at those who have been and could be offered roles in the cabinet and wider administration when Trump takes office, in this explainer piece: Russia\u2019s foreign ministry sees no grounds for talking about resuming dialogue on strategic stability and arms control with the US at the moment, Interfax news agency reported on Saturday, citing Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister. Sergei Ryabkov said that Moscow and Washington \u201care exchanging signals on Ukraine\u201d through closed channels at the military and political levels, according to Interfax. He also said that Russia was ready to listen to US president-elect, Donald Trump\u2019s proposals on resolving the crisis in Ukraine, adding that there could be no simple solution. \u201cWe are extremely thorough, responsible and attentive to any ideas that are proposed by countries in this area,\u201d Interfax quoted Ryabkov as saying. According to Reuters, Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Thursday congratulated Trump on winning the US election, praised him for showing courage when a gunman tried to assassinate him in July, and said Moscow was ready for dialogue with Trump. He said comments that Trump had made about trying to end the war were worthy of attention. Trump told NBC he had not talked to Putin since his election victory but \u201cI think we\u2019ll speak\u201d. Ryabkov said the threat of severing diplomatic relations with the US remained if Russia\u2019s frozen assets were seized or Washington escalated tensions over Ukraine. Ryabkov also commented on Russia\u2019s updated nuclear doctrine, saying it would make it possible \u201cto turn to the nuclear option\u201d if there was an acute crisis in relations with the west and the situation in Ukraine, Interfax reported. The US justice department is bringing criminal charges over an Iranian plot to kill the president-elect, Donald Trump, that was thwarted by the FBI, the government said. The federal government has unsealed criminal charges in what the justice department said was a murder-for-hire plan to take out Trump before this week\u2019s presidential election, which he won decisively over his Democratic rival, Kamala Harris. A criminal complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan alleges that an unnamed official in Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guards instructed a contact this past September to put together a plan to surveil and ultimately kill Trump. Investigators learned of the plot while interviewing Farhad Shakeri, an Afghan national identified by officials as an Iranian government asset who was deported from the US after being imprisoned on robbery charges. He told investigators that a Revolutionary Guard contact in Iran instructed him in September to devise a plan within seven days to surveil and ultimately assassinate Trump, according to the criminal complaint. Two other men who the authorities say were recruited to participate in other assassinations, including a prominent Iranian American journalist, were also arrested on Friday. Shakeri remains in Iran. \u201cThere are few actors in the world that pose as grave a threat to the national security of the United States as does Iran,\u201d the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, said in a statement on Friday. Ed Davey has urged Keir Starmer to \u201cTrump-proof\u201d the UK by urgently seeking closer European cooperation over military aid for Ukraine and economic ties, after the US president-elect\u2019s threats about security and trade wars. The Liberal Democrat leader, whose party is the third biggest in the House of Commons, argued that while the UK government should seek to work with a Donald Trump administration, it should also be as prepared as possible if he were to abandon Ukraine or impose sweeping tariffs. \u201cYes, we can work with him,\u201d Davey said. \u201cOf course we should, and it may well be that we can, but it would be irresponsible not to take the measures in a diplomatic way, defensive way, that would make our national security and our economy Trump-proof. \u201cI think millions of people in the UK and elsewhere are just really worried and quite scared. And they\u2019re particularly scared about what it\u2019s going to mean for our security and our economy.\u201d Trump\u2019s election should be \u201ca wake-up call for the government on Ukraine\u201d, said Davey, who was spending part of Friday at a charity in Surrey that provides aid packages for Ukrainian families. He said Starmer should push for an immediate European conference on how the continent could fill the gap in defence assistance if, as Trump and his team have hinted, he pulls US support, or tries to force Ukraine into accepting an end to the conflict that would greatly strengthen Russia. \u201cWe can\u2019t simply abandon Ukraine to Putin just because Trump\u2019s in power,\u201d Davey said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been playing a critical role, and I think we could play an even more critical role by working with European friends, bringing together European countries so we can increase the aid to Ukraine, and pay for that by seizing Russian assets properly. We\u2019ve been pushing for that for some time. \u201cNow is the absolute the moment to do it so Europe can fill the gap. But we have got to do it quickly.\u201d Bomb threats were made against several Maryland boards of elections and election offices in at least two California counties on Friday, state authorities said, adding that everyone was safe and law enforcement officials were investigating. According to Reuters, election officials were counting mail-in ballots when the threats came in Maryland. State administrator of elections, Jared DeMarinis, said the threats led to the evacuation of some buildings. He called the threats \u201ccowardly,\u201d adding that local officials will resume counting on Saturday. \u201cSafety is a top concern \u2013 but we WILL resume canvassing (counting) tomorrow. Cowardly threats whether from abroad or not shall not deter us,\u201d DeMarinis said on social media platform X. \u201cThe Baltimore County Police Department is aware and currently investigating the bomb threat received via email by the Baltimore County Board of Elections Office,\u201d police posted on X, later adding that a probe determined that threat to be unfounded. Reuters reports that in California\u2019s Orange County, the registrar of voters received a bomb threat at an office in Santa Ana after which the office building was evacuated and bomb detection dogs were used to conduct a search. No explosives were located, officials said, adding normal operations will resume on Saturday. The registrar of voters in California\u2019s Riverside County said its central counting building was also evacuated due to a threat and a bomb squad found no explosives. The offices of California governor, Gavin Newsom, and Maryland governor, Wes Moore, said they were monitoring the situation and working with local officials. The FBI said that hoax bomb threats, many of which appeared to originate from Russian email domains, were directed on Tuesday at polling locations in five battleground states \u2013 Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2013 as voting was under way. Russia denies interfering in US elections. Millions of Americans are at risk of losing health coverage in 2025 under Donald Trump\u2019s forthcoming administration. More than 20 million Americans rely on the individual private health insurance market for healthcare, private insurance which is subsidized by the federal government. These subsidies, programs that help lower the cost of health insurance premiums, increased the amount of assistance available to people who want to buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare as a signature piece of legislation during Barack Obama\u2019s administration. This specific subsidy program resulted from the Biden administration\u2019s 2021 American Rescue Plan and is set to expire at the end of 2025. \u201cThe consequences of more people going uninsured are really significant, not just at an individual level with more medical debt and less healthy outcomes, but also has ripple effects for providers,\u201d Sabrina Corlette, a research professor and co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University, said. \u201cPremiums go up for the people who do have health insurance; for the people without health insurance, it\u2019s financially devastating. The result is medical debt, garnished wages and liens on people\u2019s homes because they can\u2019t pay off their bills,\u201d she said. Iraqi prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, expressed hopes during a phone call with US president-elect, Donald Trump, that he would keep his \u201cpromises to work towards ending wars\u201d in the Middle East, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). In the phone call, the Iraqi premier pointed to Trump\u2019s \u201ccampaign statements and promises to work towards ending wars in the region\u201d, a statement from Sudani\u2019s office said late on Friday. \u201cThe two sides agreed to coordinate efforts in achieving this goal,\u201d it added. About 2,500 US troops are deployed in Iraq as part of a US-led coalition that was formed to help battle the Islamic State group. Bases hosting the US troops have been the target of dozens of rocket and drone attacks launched by Iran-backed groups in Iraq, which have also claimed attacks against Israel. Baghdad has for years called on Washington to provide a clear timeline for the withdrawal of their remaining coalition troops. The US and Iraq announced in late September that the international coalition would end its decade-long military mission in federal Iraq within a year, and by September 2026 in the autonomous Kurdistan region. But the joint statement and US officials did not say whether any US troops would remain in Iraq. Officials at the Pentagon are having informal discussions about what to do if Donald Trump were to give an illegal order, such as deploying the military domestically, according to a report from CNN. They are also preparing for the possibility that he may change rules to be able to fire scores of career civil servants. On the campaign trail, Trump has mulled sending the military after his political enemies, and also to turn back migrants at the southern border. US law generally prohibits active-duty troops from being deployed for law enforcement purposes. There are also fears he could gut the civil service in the Pentagon, and replace fired staff with employees selected for their loyalty to him. Just hours after Donald Trump\u2019s election win on Tuesday, Black people across the US reported receiving racist text messages telling them that they had been \u201cselected\u201d to pick cotton and needed to report to \u201cthe nearest plantation\u201d. While the texts, some of which were signed \u201ca Trump supporter\u201d, varied in detail, they all conveyed the same essential message about being selected to pick cotton. Some of the messages refer to the recipients by name. A spokesperson for the president-elect told CNN that his \u201ccampaign has absolutely nothing to do with these text messages\u201d. It is not yet clear who is behind the messages, nor is there a comprehensive list of the people to whom the messages were sent, but social media posts indicate that the messages are widespread. Black people in states including Alabama, South Carolina, Georgia, New York, New Jersey, Nevada, the DC area and elsewhere reported receiving the messages. The messages were sent to Black adults and students, including to high schoolers in Massachusetts and New York, and students at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), such as Alabama State University and other schools, including ones across Ohio, Clemson University, the University of Alabama and Missouri State. At least six middle school students in Pennsylvania received the messages, according to the AP. Authorities including the FBI and attorneys general are investigating the messages. Joe Biden\u2019s slowness in exiting the 2024 presidential election cost the Democrats dearly, the former House speaker Nancy Pelosi said, days after Kamala Harris was beaten by Donald Trump. \u201cWe live with what happened,\u201d Pelosi said. Pelosi was speaking to The Interview, a New York Times podcast, in a conversation the newspaper said would be published Saturday in full. \u201cHad the president gotten out sooner,\u201d Pelosi remarked, \u201cthere may have been other candidates in the race. The anticipation was that, if the president were to step aside, that there would be an open primary. \u201cAnd as I say, Kamala may have, I think she would have done well in that and been stronger going forward. But we don\u2019t know that. That didn\u2019t happen. We live with what happened. And because the president endorsed Kamala Harris immediately, that really made it almost impossible to have a primary at that time. If it had been much earlier, it would have been different.\u201d As Democrats engaged in bitter blame games over Harris\u2019s defeat and a second presidency for Trump, who senior Democrats from Harris down freely called a \u201cfascist\u201d, Pelosi\u2019s words landed like an explosive shell. The Times said Pelosi \u201cwent to great lengths to defend the Biden administration\u2019s legislative accomplishments, most of which took place during his first two years, when she was the House speaker\u201d. Pelosi reportedly played a key role in persuading Biden to stand aside. But she has not sought to soothe his feelings. In August, she told the New Yorker she had \u201cnever been that impressed with his political operation\u201d. Hello and welcome back to our rolling coverage of US politics and the fallout from the presidential election. Our top story this morning is that Nancy Pelosi has blamed Joe Biden for the Democrats\u2019 defeat. The former House speaker said the president\u2019s slowness in dropping out of the race left the party without enough time to hold an open primary. More on that shortly. First, though, here is a round up of the latest news: The justice department has brought charges against a member of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards paramilitary group for plotting to assassinate Donald Trump prior to Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, the Associated Press reports. On the campaign trail in the lead-up to his election win, Trump survived two assassination attempts, but authorities do not believe either were linked to Iran, a longtime foe of the United States. Donald Trump\u2019s incoming presidency is set to threaten millions of Americans\u2019 healthcare plans. More than 20 million Americans rely on the individual private health insurance market for healthcare, private insurance which is subsidized by the federal government. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the former independent presidential candidate turned Trump surrogate, is reviewing candidate resumes for the top jobs at the US government\u2019s health agencies in Donald Trump\u2019s new administration, a former Kennedy aide and a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday. A Chinese national who had been recently released from a mental hospital was ordered to be held on trespassing charges on Friday after police say he tried to enter president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate, the Associated Press reports. That entrance was in violation of a court order that he stay away from Mar-a-Lago after previous attempts. Democratic US Representative Andrea Salinas has won reelection in Oregon\u2019s 6th congressional District, beating Republican Mike Erickson to earn a second term in Congress after outraising him by millions of dollars. Oregon\u2019s newest congressional district was seen as leaning more toward Democrats, according to the Cook Political Report. That gave a slight advantage to the freshman Democratic incumbent, who also defeated Erickson in the 2022 election. Women have won 60 seats in the New Mexico Legislature to secure the largest female legislative majority in US history, stirring expressions of vindication and joy among candidates. A federal judge on Friday overturned Illinois\u2019 ban on semiautomatic weapons, leaning on recent US supreme court rulings that strictly interpret the second amendment right to keep and bear firearms. Judge Stephen P McGlynn issued the lengthy finding in a decree that he said applied universally, not just to the plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit challenging the ban. Just hours after Donald Trump\u2019s election win on Tuesday, Black people across the US reported receiving racist text messages telling them that they had been \u201cselected\u201d to pick cotton and needed to report to \u201cthe nearest plantation\u201d. While the texts, some of which were signed \u201ca Trump supporter\u201d, varied in detail, they all conveyed the same essential message about being selected to pick cotton. Some of the messages refer to the recipients by name. Donald Trump, during a call with Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday, handed the phone to Elon Musk, the New York Times reported, confirming an earlier Axios story. It is not clear what the three men discussed or whether they touched on any change in US policy toward Ukraine in the wake of Trump\u2019s election victory, the Times said. The Biden administration has decided to allow US defense contractors to work in Ukraine to maintain and repair Pentagon-provided weaponry, Reuters is reporting, citing US officials. The contractors would be small in number and located far from the frontlines and will not be engaged in combat, an official told the news agency. The judge overseeing Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 election interference case has granted a request from the special counsel\u2019s office to pause proceedings in his trial on charges related to trying to overturn the 2020 election. Jack Smith asked judge Tanya Chutkan to pause the case against the president-elect to \u201cassess the unprecedented circumstances\u201d in which the office finds itself.",

Pithy nicknames but both misnomers, really. Behind the molasses and tobacco baritone and faltering flamenco Cohen was far from a miserabilist, his words often appearing as if drenched in the Hydra sun - warm, fruity, smutty, sensual.</p> <p><em>This is about cricket you plank, what are you crapping on about?</em> Well, bear with me for just a line or two more. I\u2019m bringing us on to Jos Buttler.</p> <p>You might know him as England\u2019s greatest ever white ball batter, all whip-crack wrists and ice-veined composure. A player of such class and confidence he was made England\u2019s white ball captain after Eoin Morgan hung up his armband. And yet, the F*** It famously scrawled on Buttler\u2019s bat handle offers a glimpse into his own fragility.</p> <p>As England\u2019s results have soured and curdled so too did Buttler\u2019s on pitch performances and off pitch demeanour. A taciturn and tetchy Buttler became the norm, his watery blue eyes darting, seeking out perceived slights, his jaw perma-clenched readying for a scrap. Any boyish charm had been lost to a sort of bristling insecurity. Captaincy and professional cricket in general can do that to you.</p> <p>The discrepancy between Buttler at his shimmering, primal and pyrotechnic best and the insecure, slumped shouldered Eeyore in a Cinch branded baseball cap of recent months became quite stark. The guy looked like he needed a break and he ended up getting one, albeit because he got injured. </p> <p>A calf injury has kept Buttler on the sidelines for five months, in that time Matthew Mott was given his cards and Brendon McCullum the reins - to the white ball squads in addition to the Test one. \u2018Baz\u2019 duly noted that his priority task in the role was to shake Buttler out of his \u201cmiserable\u201d (McCullum\u2019s word, not mine) stupor and bring back the joy. To reinvigorate Sad Eyed Jossy of The Low Scores, take a sad song and make it better, prise open a crack and let some f***** light in.</p> <p>McCullum lies in wait but Jos Buttler returns to action today in Bridgetown in the first of five T20 matches against West Indies. Play begins in just over half an hour at 8PM GMT and the toss is imminent\u2026</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-09T19:31:44.782Z\">at 7.31pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "The match report has landed courtesy of Cameron Ponsonby which is my cue to go and party with Rihanna. Oh, sorry, I meant go to bed. Not with Rihanna. Oh forget it. Thanks for joining us, we\u2019ll be back same time same place for match number two tomorrow. Goodnight. On Thursday, Phil Salt turned down an invitation to party with Rihanna in favour of an early night. On Saturday, he blitzed England to an eight-wicket win against the West Indies.\u201d Phil Salt loves batting in the Caribbean and bags the Player of the Match award: I think it\u2019s probably the place I\u2019m happiest - I enjoy batting here, I\u2019ve grown up batting on these surfaces.\u201d He then describes this ton as his favourite of the three he\u2019s notched up in England\u2019s T20 colours. On Jacob Bethell: He\u2019s a huge talent! Some of the shots he played there... he\u2019s a 21-year-old lad but if you didn\u2019t know how old he was you\u2019d think he\u2019d played 100 games. Phil Salt has barely had time to let his century sink in before Jacob Bethell lofts a six over cover and then flicks the winning runs! A superb chase by England, the highest in the format at the Kensington Oval. Bethell and Salt put on a hundred partnership in just 60 balls and cruised to victory. England go 1-0 up in the five matches series and in some style. A brilliant knock from Salt, his third T20I century and all three have come in the Caribbean. He has timed everything out there this evening. He removes his helmet and lets out a guttural roar of pleasure. 16th over: England 170-2 (Salt 98, Bethell 50) Shamar Joseph has conceded 31 runs from his two overs so far this evening and his third doesn\u2019t stop the rot. Bethell swivels on a short ball and pulls with panache for SIX to move to 49. Bethell then goes to his first T20I half century in a the place where he spent his formative years. A lovely moment for him and a fine innings supporting Salt in what looks like a certain England win, they need 13 runs from 24 balls. 15th over: England 156-2 (Salt 94, Bethell 42) The umpires change the ball after the previous was deemed to have got too soggy with all the moisture on the outfield. Motie bowls his final over but can\u2019t find the breakthrough. Bethell gets a meaty edge wide of the keeper for four and eleven runs are easily collected off the over for England. 14th over: England 145-2 (Salt 93, Bethell 32) Bethell picks up four over cover and then Salt moves into the nineties with a slap into the leg side that bursts through the hands of Shepherd on the square leg boundary. A hard chance but the fielder didn\u2019t put in the best effort to take the catch or try to palm back and save the six. England need 38 from 36 balls. 13th over: England 130-2 (Salt 86, Bethell 24) West Indies in desperate need of a wicket, ideally that of Phil Salt. They nearly pick up Jacob Bethell as the youngster yorks himself on the charge and looks set to be stumped only for a desperate jab at the last that then squirts away for four. All going England\u2019s way at the moment. 12th over: England 124-2 (Salt 85, Bethell 19) Andre Russell drops a clanger by serving up a juicy hip high full toss to Phil Salt that is dispatched fine for SIX. Gah! Russell then sends down a half volley on leg stump that Salt does not miss out on, whipping past the man on the \u201845 for four more. 14 runs in all off the over, England need 59 off 48 balls. 11th over: England 110-2 (Salt 74, Bethell 16) Quiet over after drinks, four singles worked off Hosein\u2019s final over. He finishes with 0-20 as England look to target the rest. 10th over: England 106-2 (Salt 72, Bethell 14) Bethell shows he has power of his own and bunts Romario Shepherd down the ground for four. England go past the hundred mark and a section of the crowd are in good voice with a bit of Hi Ho Silver Lining being belted out. Shot! Bethell shows his touch too, opening the face and running the ball in the vacant space at third for four more. Time for a drink. 9th over: England 93-2 (Salt 69, Bethell 5) Man of the moment Motie back with the ball in hand. Salt gets under a full ball and flicks over midwicket for four. This has been a commanding innings. England need 90 from 66 balls. I reckon this game has got a moment or two left in it yet. 8th over: England 84-2 (Salt 62, Bethell 3) Things calm down a little with three singles off Shamar Joseph before Salt shows his touch and glides a four past point with velveteen hands. 7th over: England 77-2 (Salt 57, Bethell 1) Jacob Bethell, the local boy, replaces his captain and cuts to point to get off the mark. This has been an breathless game. Both sides refusing to back down, every over an event. Gudakesh Motie has just pulled off an eye-popping sinew straining catch to get rid of Jos Buttler! What a catch. Buttler ran the ball off the face down the deep third where Motie back pedalled at speed, stuck up a mitt and the ball went right in. Jubilant scenes and Buttler can\u2019t resist a second look and a rueful smile as he walks off. A golden duck on his comeback but a part in an electric bit of cricket too. Salt drives powerfully into the off side and comes back for a second run that sees him bring up 1,000 T20i runs oh but hang on a minute! 6th over: England 73-1 (Salt 54, Buttler) Here comes Jos Buttler! Will Jacks drives Motie over long on for SIX but then falls to the last ball of the PowerPlay trying to sweep and missing, the ball skidding on and skittling the stumps. Jacks is gutted but he\u2019s played a smaller role in a brilliant opening stand. Salt clears the front leg and hammers Motie\u2019s first ball down the ground for SIX and then plays an absolutely phenomenal shot to bring up his FIFTY in 25 balls, shimmying down and slamming the spinner into the digital scorecard. England and Salt are having a stonking PowerPlay. 5th over: England 54-0 (Salt 41, Jacks 11) Akeal Hosein for his third over on the bounce. Some sharp fielding in the ring frustrates Salt, Evin Lewis throwing himself to his right and then his left to stop consecutive boundaries and create two much needed dot balls. Salt very nearly then chips a simple catch to cover but fortunately for him it falls short by a few inches. Would have been a soft dismissal. Just two runs off the over in the end. Gudakesh Motie is coming on to bowl fresh off his batting cameo. 4th over: England 52-0 (Salt 40, Jacks 10) Shamar Joseph replaces Russell. Get his first ball wrong with a leg side wide and then drags down, allowing Salt to free his hands and hit a SIX fine over the leg side. Salt then lashes two boundaries in a row square of the wicket and then plays a beautiful drive on the up down the ground for four! Oh my days, and another \u2013 Joseph goes short and Salt spots it, backing away and carving for four more into the off side. 24 runs off the over! 3rd over: England 28-0 (Salt 18, Jacks 9) Hosein with his second over, he does well to keep Jacks and Salt tied down to a single each. One ball to go, can he get out of the over cheaply? Nope! Salt hangs back in his crease and pans away over long on for SIX. Don\u2019t go anywhere. 2nd over: England 20-0 (Salt 11, Jacks 8) Andre Russell trundles in with the new ball, slip in place. Salt gets a leading edge but the ball lands safe, the batters scampering three runs. SHOT! Will Jacks shows his class with a lofted drive over cover for SIX. Expensive over from Russell, England ticking. 1st over: England 6-0 (Salt 5, Jacks 1) Akeal Hosein starts with his left-arm twirl. Customarily accurate, Phil Salt manages a biff down the ground for four. Salt and Jacks run well to pick off two further singles. Here come Salt and Jacks. Here come West Indies with a spring in their step. England need to chase 183 runs to win! They had West Indies on the rack at 69-5 and 110-7 but a thrilling comeback courtesy of Gudakesh Motie and Romario Shepherd sees West Indies set an imposing total. Curran\u2019s final over goes for 16 runs as Shepherd flicked a full ball off his toes for a sublime six behind square and followed up with scorching drive over cover and into the crowd. Shepherd finishes unbeaten on 35 off 22 balls. Not long for England to lick their wounds, their chase will get underway in a little over five minutes time. 19th over: West Indies 166-9 (Shepherd 17, Shamar Joseph) West Indies are right back in this game. Sam Curran is coming on to bowl the last over. Gudakesh\u2019s Motie\u2019s highly entertaining and extremely crucial cameo comes to a close and it is just reward for Saqib Mahmood who finishes with 4-34 off his four overs. Mahmood mixed up his lengths to keep the batters guessing and eventually snared Motie off his ball, a cutter into the pitch that was flicked to Mousley on the midwicket fence. 18th over: West Indies 162-8 (Shepherd 17, Motie 32) Welcome to the death overs, Jamie Overton. Motie gets lucky with a cuff past the keeper for four but there\u2019s nothing spawny about Shepherd who clips full ball off his pads with a flourish to add four more through midwicket. 17th over: West Indies 141-8 (Shepherd 12, Motie 27) Sam Curran can\u2019t stop the Motie flow. Eleven runs off the over as Motie flays consecutive drives through the covers for four. Pre-meditated and expertly executed, Motie is seeing it like a beachball in Barbados. 16th over: West Indies 141-8 (Shepherd 11, Motie 18) Anything you can do Gudakesh\u2026 Romario Shepherd pongoes Livingstone through cover for four. Runs flowing for West Indies just when England might\u2019ve been dreaming of a low target. Motie gets four in the same area a couple of balls later, what a cameo this is from him! 15th over: West Indies 129-8 (Shepherd 6, Motie 12) Hello gruesome! Gudakesh Motie arrives at the crease and spanks his first ball over long on for SIX. Cripes! Motie means business, the next ball is hit like a tracer bullet back down the ground for SIX more! Rashid picked up the wicket and then immediately crashed back down to earth with two lusty blows to end the over. A tale of two reviews! Rashid has Hosein guessing and grasping, sliding a leg-break onto the pads, the umpire deciding it is hitting and raising the digit of doom. Hosein reviews and the ball is actually adjudged to be sliding down past the leg stump. Not out! That one is though \u2013 Rashid sends down a carbon copy that is crucially a tad straighter. Given out on the field and this time the DRS doesn\u2019t come to West Indies rescue. 14th over: West Indies 117-7 (Shepherd 6, Hosein 2) Shepherd pulls Overton for four behind square to keep West Indies ticking. Akeal Hosein joins him in the middle to try and blunt England\u2019s surge. Another stonkingly good catch by Buttler, who needs the gloves eh? Overton hits the middle of the pitch and Pooran tries to flay away off the back foot but can\u2019t control it, a top edge looks to be looping over Buttler but a well-timed leap sees the returning captain pull off another excellent diving catch. Windies in trouble now with the set man on his way back to the hutch. 13th over: West Indies 109-6 (Pooran 38, Shepherd 1) Romario Shepherd joins Pooran and nurdles a single to get off the mark. Livingstone has the last laugh as Russell tries to clear the fence once more but splats it straight to Mousley on the cover boundary rope. Big wicket that one in more ways than one. England\u2019s seventh bowler of the evening is Liam Livingstone. He nearly gets a wicket with his first ball as Russell miscues going for huge swipe but the ball somehow falls safely between three converging fielders in the deep. THAT IS OUTTA THE GROUND! Russell smashes Livingstone and the ball flies clean out of the stadium. Box office stuff. 12th over: West Indies 100-5 (Pooran 38, Russell 22) Curran goes full and sends down some cutters with the pace off. Eeeesht! A surprise bouncer from Curran whistles past Russell\u2019s nose and Curran finishes an excellent over with a wel executed yorker that nearly knocks the big man Dre Russ off his feet. The hundred comes up for West Indies with eight overs to go. 11th over: West Indies 96-5 (Pooran 35, Russell 21) Andre Russell opens up his gargantuan shoulders and smokes Rashid for consecutive sixes over over the leg side! Fifteen runs off the over as West Indies punch back, England won\u2019t breather easy while these two dangerous shot makers are out there. Time for some Sam Curran. 10th over: West Indies 81-5 (Pooran 34, Russell 8) Jamie Overton into the attack, he slams the ball into the deck and has Pooran and Russell on the back foot, still the batters do well to work for singles. Slammed but this time for SIX! Overton is lined up, another short ball is sent absolutely miles off the bat of Russell who gives zero reaction. Time to take on board some electrolytes (them) and pizza (me). Drinks. 9th over: West Indies 71-5 (Pooran 32, Russell 2) Andre Russell joins Pooran in the middle, West Indies need someone to stick with Pooran. A couple of watchful singles to end the over. Whadda grab by Jos Buttler! That\u2019ll bring a smile to his face. Electric reflexes at slip to pouch a thick edge from a back foot drive by Rurtherford. England take another and Rashid has two wickets in no time at all. 8th over: West Indies 68-4 (Pooran 30, Rutherford 2) Debutant Dan Mousley is given a bowl, he scuds down rapid off spin\u2026 the first ball of which is a horrible full toss that is duly moosed away into the crowd by Pooran for SIX. Settle down, son. Mousley does, finds his length and Pooran can only nurdle a solitary single off the rest of the over. 7th over: West Indies 61-4 (Pooran 23, Rutherford 2) Sherfane Rutherford is the new batter, he works Rashid off his pads for two runs. Three runs and the wicket off Rashid\u2019s first over, he\u2019s so often England\u2019s saviour with the white ball in hand. Adil Rashid called for and gets the breakthrough! Powell tries to go big again and would have had six if it wasn\u2019t for the towering figure of Jamie Overton leaping at mid on to pluck the ball out of the air. Brilliant catch, England continue to pick up wickets. 6th over: West Indies 58-3 (Pooran 22, Powell 18) Pooran joins the party, slamming Mahmood for SIX off the back foot, the ball sailing high into the stands. Clever batting from Pooran who runs the ball off the face and in the gap wide of third for four. Frustration for England. HUGE! Pooran spanks another SIX over midwicket. \u201cCarnage by Nicky P\u201d says Carlos Braithwaite on commentary. Spoken by a man who knows. 5th over: West Indies 39-3 (Pooran 5, Powell 17) Reece Topley is out there, all eyes on him for the next few balls. What a shot! Rovman Powell pings the first ball back over mid on for SIX. Holds the pose and why not, that was liquid batting. Oh no. Topley cuts a disconsolate figure and leaves the pitch after that one ball, there\u2019s something clearly not right with him. That\u2019s bad news for England and a personal disaster for Topley. Shut your face Wallace, here come the players and the sun is shining. We\u2019ll have play imminently! The official re-start if given as 5pm local time, ten minutes away. However, there\u2019s been some sort of super sopper spillage on the outfield which has left some unsightly skid m\u2026 hang about don\u2019t say that in The Guardian mate, stains on the outfield. Stay tuned as this turns into the inevitable time and soul sapping farce. Nothing to see here, whaddya mean it looks like a lot of sand? Can\u2019t have enough of the stuff. It\u2019s the Caribbean doofus! WEATHER WATCH: I maybe spoke too soon, there\u2019s some grey and \u2018orrible stuff lurking at the back of the ground apparently. What is wrong with you Barbados?! Now then, the players have gone off the field but for what looks like only a short delay as the sun is still shining. There\u2019s some concern about Reece Topley who slipped sending down a short ball that was scythed for SIX off the top edge by Powell. The big bowler hitting the deck hard and then walking off the field very gingerly afterwards. He\u2019s had such bad luck in his career with things like this, fingers crossed it is isn\u2019t anything serious. 4th over: West Indies 33-1 (Pooran 5, Powell 1) Phew. What an over from Mahmood, pocketing Lewis and Hetmyer with back to back deliveries. The ball to see the back of Hetmyer was a beauty - shaping away on a good length outside off stump and the new batter could not resist a fiddle at it. West Indies in trouble as Captain Powell joins Pooran in the middle and all of a sudden it starts to belt it down with rain\u2026 Mahmood on a hat-trick! Hetmyer gone first ball! Exclamation mark! Heaved away and caught in the deep! Mahmood strikes again and good diving catch inches above the turf by Jacob Bethell at mid-wicket. 3rd over: West Indies 17-1 (Lewis 13, Pooran 1) Topley mixes up his lengths well, Pooran tries to get after him but can\u2019t connect, a gloved single off a short ball brings Lewis on strike and he duly pumps a ball in his arc down through mid on for four. Easy as that. Six runs off the over. 2nd over: West Indies 11-1 (Lewis 8, Pooran 0) Nicholas Pooran is the new batter and he blocks his first ball and the last of the over. A successful one for Mahmood and England. I fell asleep in the cinema earlier. Woke up with popcorn stuck all over me and walked out looking like I was about to film a CGI movie a la Andy Serkis. Go on then, how\u2019s your Saturday? Full. Too full from Mahmood. Southpaw Lewis gets on the front foot and drives away handsomely for four. Lewis looks in fine fettle, he cracked 94 against England a week or so ago and notched a century against Sri Lanka in Pallekele just a few days before that. The openers exchange singles. Lewis on strike and GONE! Advancing down the track and losing his shape, a splat straight to Jamie Overton at short cover. England get an early one. 1st over: West Indies 4-0 (King 2, Lewis 2) Singles are the order of the day in the first over, something that Ian Bishop on the tv commentary is enthused by, he reckons it is an area for improvement for this side who can be a bit boundary or nowt. \u201cGood length, well played, single\u201d the big man purrs. Decent start for Topley, Mahmood is going to start from the other end. The players are headed out onto the field, it looks a breezy day in Bridgetown, maroon and red shirts billowing. Reece Topley is going to open up with the new white ball. Brandon King and Evin Lewis will open for West Indies. England need some early wickets, the home side\u2019s batting line up is one to drool over and be cowed by. After his level eleventy meltdown on the field the other day, Alzarri Joseph has had his knuckles rapped with a two match suspension. \u201cI recognize that my passion got the best of me\u201d said Joseph after the event. Words that simply wouldn\u2019t wash at my gaff. What do you mean you\u2019ve got plans on a Saturday night? Too good for the OBO now are we? Do get in touch if you are tuning in, the email link is loitering on the left flank of this page. You can fling me a tweet too but I probably won\u2019t read it. #EliteHonesty Confirmed Teams: West Indies: 1 Brandon King, 2 Evin Lewis, 3 Nicholas Pooran (wk), 4 Shimron Hetmyer, 5 Rovman Powell (c), 6 Sherfane Rutherford, 7 Romario Shepherd, 8 Andre Russell, 9 Akeal Hosein, 10 Gudakesh Motie, 11 Shamar Joseph England: 1 Phil Salt (wk), 2 Will Jacks, 3 Jos Buttler (c), 4 Liam Livingstone, 5 Jacob Bethell, 6 Sam Curran, 7 Dan Mousley, 8 Jamie Overton, 9 Saqib Mahmood, 10 Adil Rashid, 11 Reece Topley Buttler will bat at number three, he\u2019s only done that a handful of times before and he\u2019s also relinquished the gloves to Phil Salt. He wants to focus on his batting and giving his all to leading the side. Buttler\u2019s first act upon returning to the fold is to win the toss under sunny skies in Barbados. He says that England, in modern parlance, will prefer to chase. \u201cThere was a bit of rain yesterday so there might be some moisture.\u201d Buttler tells Ian Bishop. \u201cI\u2019m excited to get back in the middle. Jofra is missing, Overton, Topley, Mahmood play, and it\u2019s the usual top seven.\u201d Windies captain Rovman Powell admits he would have done the same had he won the toss. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep on improving\u201d Powell says from behind Judge Dredd style shades. \u201cIn years gone by we were just trying to compete, now we\u2019re trying to beat them.\u201d They called Leonard Cohen \u2018The Godfather of Gloom\u2019 and \u2018The High Priest of Pathos\u2019. Pithy nicknames but both misnomers, really. Behind the molasses and tobacco baritone and faltering flamenco Cohen was far from a miserabilist, his words often appearing as if drenched in the Hydra sun - warm, fruity, smutty, sensual. This is about cricket you plank, what are you crapping on about? Well, bear with me for just a line or two more. I\u2019m bringing us on to Jos Buttler. You might know him as England\u2019s greatest ever white ball batter, all whip-crack wrists and ice-veined composure. A player of such class and confidence he was made England\u2019s white ball captain after Eoin Morgan hung up his armband. And yet, the F*** It famously scrawled on Buttler\u2019s bat handle offers a glimpse into his own fragility. As England\u2019s results have soured and curdled so too did Buttler\u2019s on pitch performances and off pitch demeanour. A taciturn and tetchy Buttler became the norm, his watery blue eyes darting, seeking out perceived slights, his jaw perma-clenched readying for a scrap. Any boyish charm had been lost to a sort of bristling insecurity. Captaincy and professional cricket in general can do that to you. The discrepancy between Buttler at his shimmering, primal and pyrotechnic best and the insecure, slumped shouldered Eeyore in a Cinch branded baseball cap of recent months became quite stark. The guy looked like he needed a break and he ended up getting one, albeit because he got injured. A calf injury has kept Buttler on the sidelines for five months, in that time Matthew Mott was given his cards and Brendon McCullum the reins - to the white ball squads in addition to the Test one. \u2018Baz\u2019 duly noted that his priority task in the role was to shake Buttler out of his \u201cmiserable\u201d (McCullum\u2019s word, not mine) stupor and bring back the joy. To reinvigorate Sad Eyed Jossy of The Low Scores, take a sad song and make it better, prise open a crack and let some f***** light in. McCullum lies in wait but Jos Buttler returns to action today in Bridgetown in the first of five T20 matches against West Indies. Play begins in just over half an hour at 8PM GMT and the toss is imminent\u2026",
