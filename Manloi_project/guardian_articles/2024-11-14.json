Jones was excellent all night, perfect for this kind of football because he likes the ball, skips about with his head up and actually enjoys passing and moving. Jude Bellingham played with real authority and essentially scored the second with a lovely run and shot that ended up an own goal off the back of the Greece goalkeeper. Conor Gallagher bounced about like the kind of fond, excitable Labrador who just can\u2019t help knocking over the tea things. England are now in a sound position to achieve promotion from Nations League Group B. But this also felt like a moment of clarity, and of vindication even, for a man who looked here like he might just have been quite a lot of fun in the job.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England governor has urged ministers to \u201crebuild relations\u201d with the EU, warning that Brexit has undermined the UK\u2019s economy. Speaking at the Mansion House dinner in the City of London on Thursday evening, Andrew Bailey said he took no position on Brexit \u201cper se\u201d, but added: \u201cI do have to point out consequences.\u201d He said Brexit had \u201cweighed\u201d on the economy, pointing out in particular the impact of Brexit on the UK\u2019s trade in goods. \u201cIt underlines why we must be alert to and welcome opportunities to rebuild relations while respecting the decision of the British people,\u201d he added. Bank governors traditionally refrain from wading into contentious political issues, but Bailey\u2019s predecessor, Mark Carney, did warn about the potential economic impacts of Brexit before the referendum in 2016. Services exports have performed strongly since the UK left the EU, but some goods exporters, especially smaller firms, have struggled with so-called \u201cnon-tariff barriers\u201d such as customs checks. Keir Starmer\u2019s government has pledged to deepen cooperation with the EU, though Brussels has made clear it is unwilling to hold wide-ranging negotiations on the trade and cooperation agreement (TCA). Labour is opposed to re-entering the EU\u2019s single market or customs union. Instead, the government hopes to win more modest changes such as mutual recognition of professional qualifications and a veterinary agreement that could alleviate the need for checks on food exports. The Bank\u2019s governor was speaking against the backdrop of Donald Trump\u2019s threat of imposing tariffs \u2013 import taxes \u2013 on all foreign goods sold to the US. Bailey said he was opposed to this approach, calling himself \u201can old-fashioned free trader at heart\u201d. \u201cMy point is this: amidst the important need to be alert to threats to economic security, let\u2019s please remember the importance of openness,\u201d he said. Experts at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research have warned that if Trump goes ahead with his plan for a universal tariff of 10% on all imports, it could cut the UK\u2019s growth rate next year to a sickly 0.4%. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, used her speech at the same event \u2013 an annual gathering of the UK\u2019s financial sector \u2013 to praise the City, calling it the \u201ccrown jewel\u201d of the UK\u2019s economy, and saying post-crash regulation had \u201cgone too far\u201d.",

An Israeli strike killed six people, including four medics, in the village of Arab Salim in southern Lebanon on Thursday, Reuters is reporting, citing the Lebanese health ministry. In figures reported before the latest Israeli strikes, the ministry said 21 people were killed in Israeli attacks on the country on Wednesday, bringing the total killed since October last year to at least 3,386. Elizabeth Warren, a leading progressive voice in the US Senate, has denounced the Biden administration\u2019s failure to punish Israel over the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and endorsed a joint resolution of disapproval in Congress. \u201cOn October 13, the Biden administration told Prime Minister Netanyahu that his government had 30 days to increase humanitarian aid into Gaza or face the consequences under US law, which would include cutting off military assistance,\u201d the Massachusetts senator said in a statement shared with the Guardian. \u201cThirty days later, the Biden administration acknowledged that Israel\u2019s actions had not significantly expanded food, water and basic necessities for desperate Palestinian civilians. Despite Netanyahu\u2019s failure to meet the United States\u2019 demands, the Biden administration has taken no action to restrict the flow of offensive weapons.\u201d The amount of aid reaching the territory has dropped to the lowest level in 11 months, official Israeli figures show. Despite an ultimatum last month that gave Israel an ultimatum of 30 days to improve conditions or risk losing military support, the US state department announced it would not take any punitive action, insisting that Israel was making limited progress and was not blocking aid and therefore not violating US law. The US ambassador to Lebanon, Lisa Johnson, submitted a draft truce proposal to Lebanon\u2019s speaker of parliament, Nabih Berri, to halt fighting between Hezbollah and Israel, Reuters is reporting, citing sources. Johnson met with Berri, a Hezbollah ally and the typical diplomatic conduit for the group, on Thursday to submit the US\u2019s first written proposal in at least several weeks, two senior Lebanese political sources told the news agency. \u201cIt is a draft to get observations from the Lebanese side,\u201d one source said. There were no details on the contents of the proposal. The US said it disagrees with a UN committee\u2019s finding that Israeli warfare methods were consistent with \u201cgenocide\u201d and allegations by Human Rights Watch of \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d in Gaza. The UN special committee\u2019s report, which accused Israel of using starvation as a war tactic, \u201cis something we would unequivocally disagree with\u201d, US state department spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters on Thursday. \u201cWe think that that kind of phrasing and those kind of accusations are certainly unfounded,\u201d he added. On the report by Human Rights Watch which said it has evidence that suggests \u201cthe war crime of forcible transfer\u201d of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, Patel said forced displacement \u201cwould be a red line\u201d for the US. \u201cIt is wholly consistent and acceptable to ask civilians to evacuate a certain area while they are conducting certain military operations, and then for them to be able to go home,\u201d Patel said, adding that the US has not seen \u201cany kind of specific force displacement\u201d. Israel has denied allegations by Human Rights Watch that it is committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip. In a report published on Thursday, the rights group said it had collected evidence that suggested Israel is using evacuation orders to pursue the \u201cdeliberate and massive forced displacement\u201d of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, describing it as \u201ca grave breach of the Geneva conventions and a crime under the Rome statute of the international criminal court\u201d. Israel\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson, Oren Marmorstein, posted in a statement to X: Time and again, Human Rights Watch\u2019s rhetoric regarding Israel\u2019s conduct in Gaza is completely false and detached from reality. He claimed Israel\u2019s efforts are \u201cdirected solely at dismantling Hamas\u2019s terror capabilities and not at the people of Gaza\u201d and that Israel \u201cremains fully committed to facilitating the continuous flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza. \u201cIsrael will continue to operate in accordance with the law of armed conflict,\u201d he added. Israel\u2019s military said it had struck more than 300 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon in the last week. IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a news conference that targets included weapons depots, commander centers, according to Israeli media reports. He said: \u201cWe have identified that there are rockets and other weapons, that Hezbollah is launching at Israel, that were manufactured in Syria, and were transferred to Hezbollah from Syria.\u201d He said the IDF would strike \u201call attempts to transfer weapons from Syria to Hezbollah and strike any infrastructure we identify in Syria that is being used to manufacture weapons for Hezbollah\u201d. During their meeting at the White House yesterday, Joe Biden asked Donald Trump to work with him on a ceasefire deal that would see the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza, Axios reports. The Biden administration has tried to negotiate such an agreement, as well as another deal to end Israel\u2019s invasion of Lebanon, for months, with no luck. His time as president is running out, and the conflicts will become Trump\u2019s problem once he takes office. Here\u2019s more, from Axios: Biden wants to use the two months he has left in office to break the prolonged deadlock in the negotiations over a Gaza deal. Trump, on the other hand, would likely be happy to reach Inauguration Day with one less crisis on his plate. Biden also met yesterday with the families of the American hostages who are held in Gaza, two sources with knowledge of the meeting told Axios. One source said the families stressed that the hostages are running out of time and expressed concern for their lives. Biden told the families that he and Trump agreed that the hostage issue is urgent and that they want to try and solve it before Jan. 20, the other source said. An Israeli attack has targeted a bridge in the area of Qusayr in Syria near the border with northern Lebanon, Syria\u2019s state news agency Sana reported on Thursday. The reported attack came hours after Syrian state news reported several people were killed and others injured when two residential buildings in the suburbs of Damascus were hit. Citing SANA, Reuters reports that one building in the earlier attack was located in Damascus suburb of Mazzeh and the other in Qudsaya, west of the capital. Israeli army radio said the targets of the attack in Damascus were assets and the headquarters of the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad. Israel has been carrying out strikes against Iran-linked targets in Syria for years but has ramped up such raids since last year\u2019s Oct. 7 attack by Palestinian group Hamas on Israeli territory that sparked the Gaza war. It has just gone 8pm in Beirut, Tel Aviv and Gaza City, 9pm in Damascus, and 9.30pm in Tehran. These are today\u2019s latest development: Fifteen people have been killed and others injured in Israeli attacks that targeted two residential buildings in suburbs of the Syrian capital Damascus on Thursday, Syrian state news agency Sana said. Israel\u2019s military has claimed that in the last 48 hours it has struck what it termed 30 \u201cterror targets\u201d in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahieh. Israel\u2019s Arabic-language military spokesperson has again issued orders for residents to evacuate specific locations in southern Beirut. In addition Several blocks of flats have been destroyed by Israeli strikes in Bint Jbeil in southern Lebanon. Israel claims to be targeting Hezbollah facilities. Police in Paris are braced for potential violence before Thursday\u2019s France-Israel football match, with police deploying one officer for every five ticket holders at the Stade de France. Speaking to broadcaster BFMTV a few hours before the match, French president, Emmanuel Macron, said \u201cwe will not give in to antisemitism\u201d. Families of Israeli hostages taken captive to Gaza by Hamas urged US president Joe Biden and president-elect Donald Trump on Thursday to work on a deal to free those still being held before winter. A delegation of former hostages and hostages\u2019 relatives were visiting Rome for meetings including with the local Jewish community and Pope Francis. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) said on Thursday that two or three unknown people fired approximately 30 shots in the direction of peacekeepers, who fired back and moved to safety. No one was hurt and an investigation was launched, Unifil added in a statement. Twenty-one people were killed in Israeli attacks on Lebanon on Wednesday, bringing the total killed since October last year to at least 3,386, with 14,417 injured, the Lebanese health ministry said in a statement on Thursday. UN undersecretary general for peace operations, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, said the UN remains committed to keeping Unifil in place in all of its positions in southern Lebanon despite intense battles between Israeli forces and Hezbollah militants. Unifil forces \u201ccontinue to be deployed in all the positions, and we think it is very important to preserve that presence everywhere,\u201d LaCroix said. In operational updates posted to its official Telegram channel, the IDF has claimed that in the past week it has killed \u201cover 200\u201d Hezbollah operatives and destroyed 140 rocket launchers in its attacks on southern Lebanon. Israel is using evacuation orders to pursue the \u201cdeliberate and massive forced displacement\u201d of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, according to a report by Human Rights Watch, which says the policy amounts to crimes against humanity. International Atomic Energy Agency director general, Rafael Grossi, has been in Tehran, and said that Iran\u2019s nuclear installations should \u201cnot be attacked\u201d. The UN\u2019s atomic energy chief has said it is important to make progress with Iran in order to avoid the possibility of war. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, said the country was not prepared to negotiate about its nuclear programme while it was \u201cunder pressure and intimidation\u201d. The head of Iran\u2019s programme, Mohammad Eslami, issued a warning saying \u201cany interventionist resolution in the nuclear affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran will definitely be met with immediate countermeasures\u201d. The west has accused Iran of enriching uranium for military purposes, which it denies. Iran\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baqaei, has condemned remarks by Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich about Israeli intentions to fully and permanently annex the occupied West Bank. More than a year of clashes that recently escalated into war have cost Lebanon more than $5bn in economic losses and damaged nearly 100,000 homes, the World Bank said on Thursday. The report provided estimates for damage between 8 October 2023 and 27 October 2024, saying \u201cthe conflict has caused $5.1bn in economic losses\u201d, with damage to physical structures amounting to \u201cat least $3.4bn\u201d on top of that. According to a report on Wednesday in the leftwing Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Israeli forces in Gaza are clearing large areas with the apparent intention to remain inside the territory until at least the end of 2025. The Washington Post has suggested that Israel is working to time any ceasefire deal with Lebanon so that it appears as a \u201cgift\u201d to incoming US president Donald Trump when he takes office. The US government issued fresh \u201ccounter-terrorism\u201d sanctions on Thursday related to Syria\u2019s Al-Qatirji company, according to the treasury department\u2019s website. The sanctions targeted 26 individuals, companies and vessels associated with the Syrian company, the treasury department\u2019s website showed. Chris Sidoti, Australia\u2019s former human rights commissioner, told a UN press briefing that the ongoing bombardment of Gaza was sowing the seeds for generations of conflict, every day of violence making peace harder to achieve. Families of Israeli hostages taken captive to Gaza by Islamist group Hamas urged US president Joe Biden and president-elect Donald Trump on Thursday to work on a deal to free those still being held before winter, reports Reuters. A delegation of former hostages and hostages\u2019 relatives were visiting Rome for meetings including with the local Jewish community and Pope Francis. Reuters reports that during a press conference, they told reporters a deal was swiftly needed to bring back all the hostages still being held after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel, and said Biden and Trump should work together. \u201cWe hope Biden and Trump work together now to get the hostages back, before the winter \u2026 it has been so tough for them, they cannot be expected to wait another winter,\u201d said Sharon Lifshitz. Lifshitz\u2019s mother, Yocheved, was freed in October last year while her father, Oded, is still captive. \u201cThis is not about the left and right, all people should come together,\u201d she said. According to Reuters, Norberto Louis Har, who was freed in February by the Israeli armed forces, told reporters he did not care about the political camps but only that those still held were released. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) said on Thursday that two or three unknown people fired approximately 30 shots in the direction of peacekeepers, who fired back and moved to safety, reports Reuters. No one was hurt and an investigation was launched, Unifil added in a statement. French president, Emmanuel Macron, said \u201cwe will not give in to antisemitism\u201d ahead of Israel\u2019s Nations League football match against France in Paris later on Thursday, reports Agence France-Pesse (AFP). Speaking to broadcaster BFMTV a few hours before the match, which he will attend, Macron said: We will not give in to antisemitism anywhere, and violence \u2013 including in the French Republic \u2013 will never prevail, nor will intimidation.\u201d AFP reports that the Paris police chief, Laurent Nu\u00f1ez, has described the match at the Stade de France as \u201chigh risk\u201d and Israel has urged its citizens to avoid the fixture. The authorities fear it could become another flashpoint after last week\u2019s violence in the Netherlands. French prime minister, Michel Barnier, will also attend the match, as well as former presidents Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy. Macron\u2019s presence at the match is aimed at drawing a line after \u201ccontroversies and misunderstandings\u201d in recent relations between France and Israel, a member of his team said, reports AFP. The security context has clearly affected the attendance, with only about 13,000 spectators expected at the game in a venue that holds up to 80,000, French interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, has said. Twenty-one people were killed in Israeli attacks on Lebanon on Wednesday, bringing the total killed since October last year to at least 3,386, with 14,417 injured, the Lebanese health ministry said in a statement on Thursday. According to a breaking news alert on Reuters, the Lebanese health ministry have said that Israeli attacks in Lebanon on Wednesday killed 21 people. More details to follow \u2026 The US government issued fresh \u201ccounter-terrorism\u201d sanctions on Thursday related to Syria\u2019s Al-Qatirji company, according to the treasury department\u2019s website, reports Reuters. The sanctions targeted 26 individuals, companies and vessels associated with the Syrian company, the treasury department\u2019s website showed. United Nations undersecretary general for peace operations, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, said the UN remains committed to keeping its peacekeeping force, known as Unifil, in place in all of its positions in southern Lebanon despite intense battles between Israeli forces and Hezbollah militants, reports the Associated Press (AP). Unifil has continued to monitor the escalating conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah across the boundary known as the Blue Line despite Israeli calls for peacekeepers to pull back five kilometers (three miles) from the border. Unifil has accused Israel of deliberately destroying observation equipment, and 13 peacekeepers have been injured in the fighting, reports the AP. Lacroix visited some of the wounded peacekeepers during his trip to Lebanon on Thursday. Unifil forces \u201ccontinue to be deployed in all the positions, and we think it is very important to preserve that presence everywhere,\u201d LaCroix said. He added that had Unifil vacated its positions, they might have been taken over by one of the warring parties. \u201cWe have a responsibility to make sure that the UN continues to be seen as neutral and impartial,\u201d he said. Human Rights Watch said in a report released on Thursday that Israel has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip, including massive forced displacements that amount to ethnic cleansing, reports the Associated Press (AP). A new report released by the New York-based rights group said people have been killed while evacuating under Israeli orders and in Israeli-designated humanitarian zones, where hundreds of thousands are crammed into squalid tent camps. The report said the widespread, deliberate demolition of homes and civilian infrastructure in Gaza \u2013 some of them to carve a new road bisecting the territory and establish a buffer zone along Israel\u2019s border \u2013 was likely to \u201cpermanently displace\u201d many Palestinians. \u201cSuch actions of the Israeli authorities amount to ethnic cleansing,\u201d Human Rights Watch said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the report. More than a year of clashes that recently escalated into war have cost Lebanon more than $5bn in economic losses and damaged nearly 100,000 homes, the World Bank said on Thursday, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Since 23 September, Israel has ramped up its air campaign in Lebanon, later sending in ground troops after almost a year of limited, cross-border exchanges initiated by Hezbollah over the Gaza war. The World Bank report provided estimates for damage between 8 October 2023 and 27 October 2024, saying \u201cthe conflict has caused $5.1bn in economic losses\u201d, with damage to physical structures amounting to \u201cat least $3.4bn\u201d on top of that, reports AFP. The losses are \u201clargely concentrated in the commerce and tourism and hospitality sectors \u2026 as well as in the agriculture sector\u201d, the report said. \u201cThe final cost of damage and losses for Lebanon associated with the conflict is expected to significantly exceed those presented in this assessment,\u201d the report said. The conflict has also \u201cdamaged an estimated 99,209 housing units\u201d \u2013 mainly in Lebanon\u2019s war-torn south near the border with Israel \u2013 totalling $2.8bn in damages, it said. Eighty-one percent of damaged and destroyed houses are located in the Tyre, Nabatiyeh, Saida, Bint Jbeil and Marjayoun districts. The World Bank estimates that the conflict cut Lebanon\u2019s real GDP growth for 2024 by at least 6.6%, reporta AFP Lebanon had already been reeling since 2019 from an intense economic crisis that pushed most of the population into poverty. \u201cThis compounds five years of sustained sharp economic contraction in Lebanon that has exceeded 34% of real GDP, losing the equivalent of 15 years of economic growth,\u201d the World Bank said. \u201cKids aren\u2019t terrorists,\u201d Chris Sidoti told the handful of journalists assembled in the quiet of the UN\u2019s New York headquarters. Thousands of kilometres from the conflict in Gaza he was documenting, Sidoti felt compelled to repeat it: \u201cKids aren\u2019t terrorists.\u201d \u201cOn 7 October, 38 Israeli children were killed, one of them under the age of two years. Since then, at least \u2026 13,319 children have been killed in Gaza, of whom 786 were under the age of one. In addition, 165 children have been killed in the West Bank,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a statistic that, to me, says everything.\u201d Sidoti, Australia\u2019s former human rights commissioner, told Guardian Australia in a subsequent interview this week that he feared an already intolerable conflict would only worsen: People are still being killed, in particular, kids are still being killed in very large numbers, and the likelihood is it will get worse before it gets better.\u201d Sidoti was in New York to present a report by the UN\u2019s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel. He is one of the commission\u2019s three members. He told the UN press briefing the ongoing bombardment of Gaza was sowing the seeds for generations of conflict, every day of violence making peace harder to achieve. When the current Israeli prime minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu talks about finishing off Hamas, I wonder about what the 1 million children in Gaza will be doing in 20 years\u2019 time. The conflict in Gaza is an Israeli terrorism creation factory and there is no sign of it finishing.\u201d He said the spiralling cycle of violence could not be arrested by more violence. There is no end in sight. To help these kids, to help Israel, it\u2019s got to stop. Then, there is a possibility, but until it stops, there is no chance.\u201d It is approaching 5pm in Beirut, Tel Aviv and Gaza City, 6pm in Damascus, and 6.30pm in Tehran. Here are the headlines \u2026 15 people have been killed and others injured in Israeli attacks that targeted two residential buildings in suburbs of the Syrian capital Damascus on Thursday, Syrian state news agency Sana said Israel\u2019s military has claimed that in the last 48 hours it has struck what it termed 30 \u201cterror targets\u201d in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahieh.

Israel\u2019s military reports that in the last 30 minutes \u201capproximately five projectiles\u201d were fired at the Haifa area, on Israel\u2019s coast. There are no reports of any injuries. Syrian state media has given a death toll of 15 people killed in an Israeli attack on Damascus. Energy minister Eli Cohen, in an interview with Reuters, has expressed the view that Israel is \u201ccloser to an arrangement than we have been since the start of the war\u201d over fighting in Lebanon. It somewhat contradicts statements earlier in the week by new defense minister Israel Katz who promised there would be \u201cno ceasefire\u201d and \u201cno respite\u201d in the fighting, and that Israel would not \u201ctake its foot off the pedal.\u201d Reuters quotes Cohen saying on Thursday \u201cWe will be less forgiving than in the past over attempts to create strongholds in territory near Israel. That\u2019s how we will be, and so that is certainly how we will act.\u201d Earlier this week Hezbollah said it had not been involved in any direct talks. Lebanon\u2019s speaker, Nabih Berri, who negotiates on behalf of Hezbollah, said on Tuesday that \u201cThere is no sane person who thinks that we will agree to a settlement or solution that achieves the interest of Israel at the expense of Lebanon and its sovereignty.\u201d An overnight report in the Washington Post suggested an Israeli official had told it that any deal would be timed so that it appeared as a gift to Donald Trump as he takes over the US presidency. Israel\u2019s war aim is to return the tens of thousands of Israelis displaced from their homes in northern Israel, and to push Hezbollah back to the line of the Litani river, in accordance with UN security council resolution 1701. The Litani river is about 18 miles (29km) north of where the UN-drawn blue line currently separates Israel and Lebanon. Qatar recently announced that it would stop mediating between Hamas and Israel over combat and hostages in Gaza as it believed neither party was acting in good faith in the negotiations. In a statement on its official Telegram channel, Israel\u2019s military has said that as of 3pm local time (1pm GMT), \u201capproximately 25 projectiles\u201d had been fired from Lebanon into Israel. It blamed them on Hezbollah. There were no reports of any casualties. Iran\u2019s president Masoud Pezeshkian has said Tehran is prepared to cooperate with the UN nuclear watchdog IAEA to clear up \u201calleged ambiguities about the peaceful nuclear activity of our country\u201d, Iranian state media reported. Police in Paris are braced for potential violence before Thursday\u2019s France-Israel football match, with police deploying one officer for every five ticket holders at the Stade de France. The match has been designated \u201chigh risk\u201d after the hooliganism and antisemitism in Amsterdam last week when the Israeli team Maccabi Tel Aviv played Ajax. Concerns over Thursday\u2019s game were further raised after riot police clashed with pro-Palestinian protesters on Wednesday night outside a gala event in Paris where funds were being raised for the Israeli military. Israel\u2019s controversial far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, had been due to speak but subsequently cancelled. Police pushed against dozens of protesters waving Palestinian flags and lighting flares near Saint-Lazare station, with reports suggesting that teargas had been deployed as officers struggled to contain the crowds. The Uefa Nations League tie between France and Israel, which is due to start at 8.45pm local time (7.45pm UK), is not expected to attract a large crowd, with fewer than 20,000 tickets sold for the 80,000 capacity stadium. Only about 150 Israeli fans are expected. Despite the low attendance, about 4,000 police officers are expected on the streets along with another 1,500 on public transport routes. A pro-Palestinian demonstration has been organised at Saint-Denis plaza at 6pm local time to protest against the staging of the match at a time of war in the Middle East. More on that attack in Damascus. These images have now appeared on the news wires: Several people have been killed and others injured in Israeli attacks that targeted two residential buildings in suburbs of the Syrian capital Damascus on Thursday, Syrian state news agency SANA said. Citing SANA, Reuters reports that one building was located in Damascus suburb of Mazzeh and the other in Qudsaya, west of the capital. Israeli army radio said the targets of the attack in Damascus were assets and the headquarters of the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad. Israel has been carrying out strikes against Iran-linked targets in Syria for years but has ramped up such raids since last year\u2019s Oct. 7 attack by Palestinian group Hamas on Israeli territory that sparked the Gaza war. Dutch authorities have said they are investigating reports of police violence against pro-Palestinian protesters after a banned rally on Wednesday evening had been broken up. Amsterdam police said on X that they were aware of online footage, which seemed to show police officers beating protesters who had already been released after being taken away from the site of the protest. A total of 281 protesters were detained as they rallied in central Amsterdam on Wednesday in defiance of a ban imposed after violence stemming from a football match between Ajax and the Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv last week. Detained protesters were put on buses and driven to a location on the outskirts of the city, where they were released. Read more here: Dutch authorities investigate alleged police violence after pro-Palestinian protest Iranian news agency Tasnim reports that Iran\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei has condemned remarks by Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich about Israeli intentions to fully and permanently annex the occupied West Bank. It reports that Baqaei said the comments were a \u201cclear sign of the racist and expansionist nature and the aggressive approach of a regime that was created and expanded based on grabbing Palestinian territories\u201d and \u201cpart of the Israeli genocide and its policy of wiping out Palestine, which have been implemented in the most brutal way possible over the past year.\u201d Earlier in the week the finance minister Smotrich had welcomed the election of Donald Trump in the US, complaining that Joe Biden\u2019s administration had \u201cunfortunately chosen to intervene in Israeli democracy\u201d, and that the incoming administration would be an \u201cimportant opportunity\u201d to \u201capply Israeli sovereignty to the settlements in Judea and Samaria,\u201d a term used for the West Bank by some Israelis. In a statement on its official Telegram channel, Israel\u2019s military has claimed that in the last 48 hours it has struck what it termed 30 \u201cterror targets\u201d in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahieh. Considered to be a Hezbollah stronghold, the IDF said in its message it had struck at \u201cweapons storage facilities, command centres, and additional terrorist infrastructure sites.\u201d The statement continued: These strikes were a part of the IDF\u2019s ongoing efforts to dismantle and degrade Hezbollah\u2019s military capabilities, and the IDF is continuing to strike Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure sites in the Dahieh area. Reporting from Beirut for the Guardian, on Tuesday William Christou noted that among the places targeted by the strikes were a ten-story block of flats, a chicken restaurant and a medical complex. Lebanese authorities have put the number of people killed by Israeli airstrikes in recent weeks at over 3,000, with more than 14,000 injured. The casualties came on top of those inflicted by exploding pagers and walkie-talkies in Lebanon in an attack aimed at Hezbollah which Israel\u2019s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he personally had ordered. Israel claims to take mitigating precautions to avoid civilian casualties, ordering residents of neighbouring Lebanon out of their homes before it carries out what it claims are \u201cintelligence-based strikes\u201d. Authorities in Lebanon have said about 1.2 million people have been displaced from their homes by fighting in southern Lebanon and the aerial bombardment. Northern Israel has also come under near constant fire from Hezbollah, forcing tens of thousands of people there to evacuate their homes. In the last few minutes warning sirens have again sounded in the western Galilee area of Israel. There are reports of an Israeli attack on Damascus in Syria. More details soon \u2026 It is approaching 2pm in Beirut, Tel Aviv and Gaza City, and 3.30pm in Tehran. Here are the headlines \u2026 Israel is using evacuation orders to pursue the \u201cdeliberate and massive forced displacement\u201d of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, according to a report by Human Rights Watch, which says the policy amounts to crimes against humanity Israel\u2019s Arabic-language mnilitary spokesperson has again issued orders for residents to evacuate specific locations in southern Beirut, which has been subject to multiple strikes by Israeli forces on Thursday.

The report says an Isreali official told the paper \u201cThere is an understanding that Israel would gift something to Trump \u2026 that in January there will be an understanding about Lebanon\u201d Qatar\u2019s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani arrived in Ankara to meet Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Earlier this week Erdo\u011fan said Turkey had broken off all ties with Israel over its actions in Gaza. Qatar has recently announced it would step back from its attempts to mediate between Israel and Hamas. It said it had concluded the two sides were no longer negotiating in good faith Arwa Damon, who is in the central Gaza Strip for the International Network for Aid, Relief and Assistance organisation, has told Al Jazeera that the situation in Gaza is \u201can impossible situation.\u201d Speaking from Deir el-Balah she told the network: The bombing is relentless, there has been no adequate humanitarian assistance, and there isn\u2019t sufficient medical care either. Part of the reluctance to leave the north is fear of the road. People are afraid to be targeted as they are leaving. There are families that are being separated. Qatar\u2019s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani arrived in Ankara on Thursday, Reuters reports, where he will meet with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Earlier this week the Turkish president stated that his nation had cut off all ties with Israel over its actions in Gaza. Qatar has recently announced it would step back from its attempts to mediate between Israel and Hamas. It said it had concluded the two sides were no longer negotiating in good faith. In a statement today the foreign ministry of the Palestinian Authority has suggested that Israeli ministers have been outlining their ambition to fully and permanently annex the Israeli-occupied West Bank as a test of international reaction. Palestinian news agency Wafa reports the ministry\u2019s spokesperson said: The Israeli government began to issue a torrent of statements and positions regarding its expansionist colonial ambitions and projects calling for the annexation of the occupied West Bank or parts of it, as trial balloons to examine international reactions and the positions of countries in this regard, in an attempt to create a climate conducive to committing this heinous crime. The ministry accused Israel of a \u201cwar of extermination, displacement and liquidation of the Palestinian cause \u2026 undermining any opportunity to implement the two-state solution.\u201d It accused Israel of \u201cescalating its illegal unilateral measures on the ground, from seizing lands, demolishing homes, [and] paving more colonial roads,\u201d and accused Israel of planning to displace approximately 1,500 citizens by demolishing a neighbourhood in Silwan in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem. International Atomic Energy Agency director general Rafael Grossi has been in Tehran, and as part of his press conference earlier he said that Iran\u2019s nuclear installations should \u201cnot be attacked.\u201d The facilities have been oft-mooted targets during the exchanges of fire between Iran and Israel during 2024, and the last attack on Iran by Israel was believed to have targeted air defences which in theory could protect Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. Israel\u2019s recently appointed defense minister, Israel Kataz, this week pointedly said that Iran\u2019s nuclear facilites were \u201cmore exposed than ever.\u201d Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the newswires from the region. In the UK, Hamish Falconer, who is the under-secretary of state for the Middle East in the Labour government, has added his voice to condemnation of comments by Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich concerning Israeli plans to fully and permanently annexe the West Bank, which it has occupied since 1967. Smotrich, after the election of Donald Trump in the US, declared 2025 to be a \u201cyear of sovereignty\u201d for the occupied West Bank, which he habitually calls Judea and Samaria. Falconer said \u201cI condemn minister Smotrich\u2019s comments proposing annexation of land in the West Bank. Annexation only undermines the prospects for peace, would lead to greater instability and would be illegal under international law. The Israeli government must reject this.\u201d Smotrich, who has made similar assertions over the years and has described it as his life\u2019s mission to thwart the creation of a Palestinian state, has faced no sanction from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the comments. Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that in Jalud village, south of Nablus, Israeli settlers have attacked and stolen some of the olive crop. Wafa notes there have been more than 250 attacks of this nature since the beginning of the 2024 olive harvest season. It reports that in today\u2019s incident the settlers fired on Palestinians, and were, it says, \u201cunder the protection of the occupation forces.\u201d Al Jazeera reports that two more people have been killed by Israeli strikes on Gaza. The news network reports that \u201cthe attack, in Beit Lahiya, which hit a house, also wounded several people.\u201d Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government has banned Al Jazeera from operating inside Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. In the wake of a new report by Human Rights Watch which accuses Israel of crimes against humanity over its policy of forcing the displacement of people in Gaza, people working for ActionAid Palestine have been talking of their experiences of being forcibly moved around the Gaza Strip by Israel\u2019s military action. Asmaa, 40, works for an organisation helping women and girls in the territory, and says: The war has numerous negative effects on women\u2019s lives. I lost the safety I used to feel. I lost everything imaginable, from my house to my safety, privacy, and dignity. The war took away the house we spent so much time building. Our memories, hopes, and aspirations. These were all stolen from us. Fatma, a project officer with ActionAid, has been displaced multiple times herself, saying: [My family and I] have been trapped in a constant cycle of displacement and loss. We have been forced to flee again and again, moving from the north to the south, seeking and searching for safety, survival and security. The devastation we have endured, seeing the same heartbreak in other families, has been overwhelming. The UN\u2019s atomic energy chief has said it is important to make progress with Iran in order to aovid the possibility of war. Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, was speaking in Tehran at a press conference, after a visit aimed at improving the inspection regime for Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. AFP quotes him saying: It is indispensable to get, at this point in time, to some concrete, tangible, visible results that will indicate that this joint work is improving the situation \u2026 and in a general sense is moving us away from conflict and ultimately war. Earlier, Iran\u2019s foreign minister Abbas Araqchi said the country was not prepared to negotiate while it was \u201cunder pressure and intimidation.\u201d Iran has been accused by the west of using its nuclear programme in an attempt to make weapons. Iran has argued it is a peaceful civilian energy programme. The head of Iran\u2019s programme, Mohammad Eslami, speaking alongside Grossi, also issued a warning, saying: Any interventionist resolution in the nuclear affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran will definitely be met with immediate countermeasures. Israel\u2019s Arabic-language mnilitary spokesperson has again issued orders for residents to evacuate specific locations in southern Beirut ahead of an imminent Israeli attack. Israel claims to be targeting Hezbollah facilities. The city has already been struck several times today. Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency reports that Israel has struck twice at Deir el Zahrani in the south of the country, after munitions failed to explode in the initial attack. The NNA published a picture of an Israeli weapon lying unexploded in the road. Palestinian media sources are reporting that Hezbollah has claimed to have attacked Israeli troops inside the south-east of Lebanon between Houla and Markaba with a volley of rockets. The claims have not been independently verified. Several blocks of flats have been destroyed by Israeli strikes in Bint Jbeil in southern Lebanon, AFP reports, citing Lebanese media. The town is close to the UN-drawn blue line that separates Israel and Lebanon. Israel says it has been targeting Hezbollah facilities in the area. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, has posted a readout to social media after meeting with the head of the UN\u2019s nuclear agency, the IAEA. In the messages, Araqchi said he and Rafael Grossi had \u201cimportant and straightforward talks\u201d but stressed that Tehran was not willing to entertain negotiations \u201cunder pressure and intimidation.\u201d He continued: As a committed member of NPT [the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons] we continue our full cooperation with the IAEA. Differences can be resolved through cooperation and dialogue. We agreed to proceed with courage and good will. Iran has never left the negotiation table on its peaceful nuclear programme. The ball is in the EU/E3 court. Willing to negotiate based on our national interest and our inalienable rights, but NOT ready to negotiate under pressure and intimidation. The last part could be read as a warning to incoming US president Donald Trump, who unilaterally pulled the US out of the Iran nuclear agreement and reimposed sanctions. Iran has always maintained its nuclear programme is an entirely peaceful civilian one, an assertion that has been doubted by some western observers, in particular the US and Israel, who have accused Tehran of seeking nuclear weapons. Israel has never officially declared it has a nuclear weapons capability, but is widely believed to do so. Israel\u2019s military has reported warning sirens sounding again in northern Israel. Overnight the IDF announced that six soldiers had been killed in clashes with Hezbollah inside southern Lebanon. The Times of Israel reports \u201cit was one of the heaviest single-day losses in the operation that began in late September,\u201d and that \u201caccording to an initial IDF probe, the soldiers were killed in an exchange of fire with at least four Hezbollah operatives inside a building in a village in southern Lebanon.\u201d Lebanese authorities have put the death toll in the country since Israel stepped up its airstrikes at over 3,000 people, with more than 14,000 people wounded. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty figures being issued during the conflict. According to a report yesterday in the leftwing Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Israeli forces in Gaza are clearing large areas with the apparent intention to remain inside the territory until at least the end of 2025. The newspaper reported that a \u201ccombat graph for 2025\u201d distributed in recent weeks to Israeli soldiers and commanders in Gaza describes \u201cexposing large areas\u201d in the coastal strip: destroying existing buildings and infrastructure in addition to the construction of roads and preparations for building more permanent military facilities. Overnight the Washington Post has suggested that Israel is working to time any ceasefire deal with Lebanon so that it appears as a \u201cgift\u201d to incoming US president Donald Trump when he takes office. The report says an Isreali official told the paper \u201cThere is an understanding that Israel would gift something to Trump \u2026 that in January there will be an understanding about Lebanon.\u201d There have been contradictory noises from Israeli ministers about the prospects for a settlement on Israel\u2019s northern front in recent days. Foreign minister Gideon Saar said \u201ccertain progress\u201d had been made on a deal, but defense minister Israel Katz said there would be \u201cno ceasefire\u201d and \u201cno respite\u201d in Lebanon, and that Israel \u201cwill not take our foot off the pedal\u201d in its fight against Hezbollah. At least one member of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government has said they will collapse the coalition if a peace deal was signed with Hezbollah. Hezbollah has said it has had no direct participation in talks. Reuters has a quick snap, citing local medics, that three people have been killed by an Israeli strike on Gaza City, with ten others wounded. More details soon \u2026 Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency reports an Israeli strike on Nabatieh in the south of the country. Here are some of the latest pictures sent over the newswires from Beirut in Lebanon, which has again been the target of Israeli strikes. Israel\u2019s military has issued a further set of orders for people in the southern suburbs of Beirut to evacuate. Lebanese media reports there have been at least three strikes on the Choueifat area, which is a suburb in the south-east of Lebanon\u2019s capital, close to the international airport. More details soon \u2026 In operational updates posted to its official Telegram channel, Israel has claimed that in the past week it has killed \u201cover 200\u201d Hezbollah operatives and destroyed 140 rocket launchers in its attacks on southern Lebanon. Authorities in Lebanon have put the death toll from recent Israeli strikes at over 3,000, with more than 14,000 people injured. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty figures being issued during the conflict. It its statement, the IDF said of its attacks on Lebanon \u201cThese strikes further degrade Hezbollah\u2019s capability to carry out terror attacks from southern Lebanon against Israeli civilians on the northern border. The IDF will continue to operate to thwart any danger or threat against the State of Israel.\u201d Tens of thousands of Israelis have been forced to flee their homes in the north of the country, and Benjamin Netanyahu has set their safe return as one of Israel\u2019s war aims. Israel\u2019s military also states that it continues to operate in the Beit Lahia and Jabaliya areas of the Gaza Strip where, it says, \u201ctroops located a large amount of weapons and eliminated dozens of terrorists from the air and ground.\u201d The claims have not been independently verified. Israel is using evacuation orders to pursue the \u201cdeliberate and massive forced displacement\u201d of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, according to a report by Human Rights Watch, which says the policy amounts to crimes against humanity. The US-based group added it had collected evidence that suggested \u201cthe war crime of forcible transfer [of the civilian population]\u201d, describing it as \u201ca grave breach of the Geneva conventions and a crime under the Rome statute of the international criminal court\u201d. The report was published amid mounting evidence that Israel is accelerating its efforts to cut the Gaza Strip in two with a buffer zone and is building new infrastructure to support a prolonged military presence, with an increased pace of demolitions and destruction. Residents in northern Gaza said Israeli forces were besieging displaced families and the remaining population, which some estimated at a few thousand, ordering them to head south through a checkpoint separating two towns and a refugee camp from Gaza City. Men were held for questioning, while women and children were allowed to continue towards Gaza City, residents and Palestinian medics said. Calling for Israel\u2019s policy of forced displacement to be investigated by the international criminal court, Human Rights Watch also urged targeted sanctions against Israel including the cessation of arms sales. Read more here: Israel accused of crimes against humanity over forced displacement in Gaza Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s ongoing coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. Here are the headlines \u2026 Israel\u2019s military has claimed that in the last week it has killed \u201cover 200\u201d Hezbollah members and dismantled 140 rocket launchers in southern Lebanon. The claims have not been independently verified Human Rights Watch said in a report released Thursday that Israel\u2019s repeated evacuation orders in Gaza amount to the \u201cwar crime of forcible transfer\u201d, and to \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d in parts of the Palestinian territory International Atomic Energy Agency director general Rafael Grossi met Iran\u2019s top diplomat Thursday during a visit to Tehran. Later, Grossi is expected to meet president Masoud Pezeshkian in their first meeting since his election earlier this year, and to hold a press conference Australia has backed a UN resolution to recognise the \u201cpermanent sovereignty\u201d of Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, marking a major departure from its previous position Ice-cream brand Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s said in a lawsuit filed Wednesday that parent company Unilever has silenced its attempts to express support for Palestinian refugees",

The game had been designated as \u201chigh risk\u201d after the hooliganism and antisemitism witnessed in the Netherlands before and after a Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv last week. The Israeli national anthem was booed by some in the crowd before kick-off and, within 10 minutes of the game starting, a small number of fans clashed on a high stand in the stadium. The clash was quickly dealt with by the security guards, with riot police seen at the edge of the stands ready to intervene. The authorities in Paris had been on high alert. Emmanuel Macron, who attended the game with his interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, and the prime minister, Michel Barnier, in an act of solidarity with the victims of antisemitism, said France would not accept discrimination. Former presidents Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy were also in the stands to watch the goalless draw. Macron told the French TV channel BFMTV: \u201cWe will not give in to antisemitism anywhere and violence, including in the French Republic, will never prevail, nor will intimidation.\u201d There were fewer than 20,000 people in the Stade de France at the Uefa Nations League match, making it the lowest attendance recorded in the 80,000-capacity stadium. Patrick Bensimon, a co-founder of the NGO Diaspora Defense Forces, said he had organised for 600 Israel fans to be transported to the stadium in chartered buses under police escort. He said: \u201c80% of the people who are here did not want to go to the Stade de France. Some were afraid, especially following the events in Amsterdam.\u201d One Israel fan draped in the Israeli flag told reporters outside the stadium before the game: \u201cWe want to show that we are not afraid of anyone, except God.\u201d His friend said \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t mix sport and politics\u201d and that they hoped \u201cthere won\u2019t be any scuffles outside the stadium\u201d. Despite the low attendance, about 4,000 police officers were on the streets around the stadium along with 1,600 security personnel. Israel\u2019s government had instructed its nationals to avoid the game amid heightened tensions. A pro-Palestinian demonstration around 2km from the stadium outside the Front Populaire M\u00e9tro station in St-Denis attracted a few hundred protesters. They marched in the direction of the stadium but were turned around by riot police. \u00c9ric Coquerel, an MP for Seine-Saint-Denis and a member of the leftwing France Unbowed party, said: \u201cWe are living in a schizophrenic moment.

Concerns had been raised after riot police clashed with pro-Palestinian protesters on Wednesday night outside a gala event in Paris where funds were being raised for the Israeli military. Israel\u2019s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, had been due to speak but subsequently cancelled. Police pushed against dozens of protesters waving Palestinian flags and lighting flares near St-Lazare station, and reports suggested teargas had been deployed as officers struggled to contain the crowds.

That means Finland are relegated to League C, while Ireland will contest a relegation play-off.

      "bodyText": "David Hytner was at the Olympiako Stadio Spyros Louis. His report is in, and here it is! Thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night. Lee Carsley, thoroughly vindicated, speaks to ITV. \u201cWe\u2019re moving in the right direction \u2026 we won\u2019t get too carried away \u2026 it\u2019s important we recover for that \u2026 it\u2019s important the players played to their strengths \u2026 we have a lot of outstanding talent \u2026 the players who weren\u2019t here, we concentrated on the ones who were \u2026 we spoke about players getting their opportunity and we saw that tonight \u2026 Curtis is an outstanding player \u2026 it was an excellent performance \u2026 I\u2019m really delighted for him \u2026 these players play at a really high level.\u201d Jude Bellingham talks to ITV. \u201cA good win \u2026 an important win \u2026 a lot was made of the lads that weren\u2019t here but the lads that were here, who showed up, were amazing \u2026 Curtis making his debut, scoring, playing as he did \u2026 amazing, really proud of the boys tonight \u2026 there would have been a million and one excuses if we hadn\u2019t played well tonight or got over the line \u2026 but the lads went out and did their business so professionally \u2026 back to the top of the group, where we belong.\u201d Curtis Jones adds: \u201cI tried \u2026 the lads around helped as well \u2026 I was playing with a smile on my face, I was enjoying it \u2026 a goal as well.\u201d Speaking of Ireland, they held on for a 1-0 win over Finland in Dublin. Caoimhin Kelleher saved a second-half Joel Pohjanpalo penalty to ensure Evan Ferguson\u2019s first-half goal was enough. That means Finland are relegated to League C, while Ireland will contest a relegation play-off. As for England, their 3-0 win tonight trumps Greece\u2019s 2-1 victory at Wembley, and so they go into the final round of matches in control of their own destiny. A win and they\u2019re back at the top table. England P5 W4 D0 L1 F11 A3 Pts12 Greece P5 W4 D0 L1 F9 A4 Pts12 Republic of Ireland P5 W2 D0 L3 F3 A7 Pts6 Finland P5 W0 D0 L5 F2 A11 Pts0 That was a really satisfying performance from England. Greece came at them for big chunks of both halves, but never came seriously close to scoring, England holding them at arm\u2019s length in determined fashion. And when England went forward, they did so decisively and elegantly: a fine team move finished by Ollie Watkins, a fortunate second forced by Jude Bellingham\u2019s potent shot, another flowing move cutely rounded off by Curtis Jones. Noni Madueke, Anthony Gordon and Morgan Gibbs-White enjoyed themselves too. And hats off to Lee Carsley, whose decision to bench Harry Kane paid off after just seven minutes. He\u2019ll depart a hero, providing his side finish the job against Ireland at the weekend. England go to the top of Group B2! A win over Ireland at Wembley on Sunday and they\u2019ll be promoted back to League A. 90 min +2: Mantalos has a whack through a smoky England box, a flare having been lit behind the goal. Pickford parries it clear. The keeper\u2019s had a good evening, Greece held at arm\u2019s length. The scoreline slightly obscuring the amount of work he\u2019s had to do. 90 min +1: Rogers dribbles down the left, enters the box, thinks about shooting, thinks too long about shooting, and the chance has gone. 90 min: There will be four extra minutes. 89 min: Mantalos tries to launch an attack but the sheer tenacity of Gibbs-White scuppers his plan. Gibbs-White hasn\u2019t been on for long, but he\u2019s shone nonetheless. 87 min: Giannoulis takes a shot from the edge of the box, but it\u2019s easily blocked. Greek hopes in ruins now. 86 min: Kane fancies getting in on the goalscoring action, and bustles down the right accordingly, but only succeeds in getting accidentally whacked upside the head. A sore one, but he\u2019ll play on. 85 min: Greece haven\u2019t lost a competitive match for over a year. There goes that record! Game over, and in some style! Bowen and Gibbs-White combine down the right. The latter cuts back for Jones, who sends an exquisite back-flick across Vlachodimos and into the bottom left! What a finish that is. Fine team move, too, with Gibbs-White in the thick of it. 82 min: Mantalos comes on for Siopis. 81 min: Greece were seriously pushing for an equaliser there. But now look. If England are able to hold onto this lead, they\u2019ll just need to beat Ireland on Sunday to make it back to the top table in the Nations League \u2026 and there\u2019d be nothing Greece can do about it. 79 min: England are now in control of Group B2! Gibbs-White comes on for Gallagher. Well, this is one way to settle those nerves! Bellingham barrels down the inside-left channel and has a whack. The shot gets past Vlachodimos, but cannons off the base of the left-hand post. It clips the diving keeper\u2019s heel \u2013 think unsuccessful scorpion kick - and back into the net. Gallagher tries to nick the goal on the line, but doesn\u2019t get there in time. What a huge stroke of luck at exactly the right time for England! Fine shot by Bellingham, though, having said that. 76 min: Giannoulis crosses low from the left. Tzolis tries to divert it towards the top-right corner, but the ball\u2019s always destined to waft wide of the goal. England aren\u2019t quite clinging on, but a few nerve-ends are jangling nonetheless. 75 min: Rota romps into space down the right. His low cross somehow evades everyone in the box. But the home fans are really up for this now, as Greece press for the equaliser. 73 min: Jones sends Rogers off on a run down the left. Rogers rolls infield for Kane, who attempts to curl one into the top right from distance. Telegraphed, and easy to gather for Vlachodimos. 72 min: Konstantelias tries to barge his way through the middle of the England defence at pace, but Gu\u00e9hi does just enough to unsettle him and put an end to his plan. 71 min: Konstantelias comes on for Masouras. 70 min: Giannoulis dribbles hard and fast down the left. It\u2019s a fine run, but it doesn\u2019t end with a cross to match. His appalling delivery floats miles over the head of everyone in the box. 69 min: Pelkas finds a pocket of space, 20 yards out, but doesn\u2019t quite connect with his shot, which dribbles through to Pickford. Greece beginning to come on strong again. 67 min: England make a triple change, replacing Gordon, Watkins and Madueke with Bowen, the debutant Rogers, and that man Harry Kane. 66 min: A free kick for Greece looped down the inside-right channel. Tzolis extends a leg but can\u2019t connect. Masouras tries again but only manages to clip Pickford. Another player who is performing right on the edge of legality. 64 min: Pelkas drives down the middle of the park. Ioannidis stands strong on the edge of the D and lashes a shot towards the bottom right. It looks a goal all the way, but Pickford gets a fingertip to the ball to divert it out for a corner. Earlier in the move, Gallagher clipped Zafeiris and was lucky not to pick up a second yellow. Nothing comes of the corner. 62 min: Zafeiris goes into the book for a lunge at Lewis. He\u2019ll not play in Finland. 60 min: Gordon swings the free kick long. It\u2019s a teasing delivery to the back stick. Bellingham tries to connect with a high-kick, six yards out, but isn\u2019t able to divert the ball goalwards. Gordon isn\u2019t happy. His ball deserved better. 59 min: Gallagher\u2019s sheer industry down the left is enough to win a free kick, as he\u2019s hooked to the floor by Siopis. A chance for England to load the box. 58 min: Tzolis hoicks over the bar harmlessly from distance. The crowd enjoyed it, though. 56 min: Greece make a triple change, replacing Bakasetas, Pavlidis and Tsimikas with Ioannidis, Pelkas and Giannoulis. 54 min: The corner is hit long, Madueke crosses from the right. From ten yards out, Watkins steers a neat header across Vlachodimos, the keeper\u2019s feet planted, and off the left-hand post! Greece clear their lines. England getting closer and closer to snatching control of Group B2. 53 min: It\u2019s nearly two. It\u2019s Madueke again, who teases Tsimikas down the right before cutting back for Lewis, who slaps his first-time shot straight at Vlachodimos, who nevertheless saves well with a strong hand. Then from the resulting corner \u2026 51 min: That damn fool is still waving his laser pen around. \u201cIf you want squads with names ending in the same set of characters, then Iceland at Euro 2016 is hard to beat as it had a 23-man squad full of -sons,\u201d writes Andy (not that one) Flintoff. \u201cHowever, that is a cheat, as they\u2019re not really surnames but patronymics (father\u2019s name + \u2018-son\u2019).\u201d 49 min: This is all really scrappy. Neither team can keep hold of the ball at the moment. 48 min: England start the second half at their own pace. Not high. The home crowd frustrated as Greece chase about. 46 min: Hall\u2019s introduction at left-back sends Rico Lewis over to the other flank, with Kyle Walker pairing up with Marc Gu\u00e9hi in the middle. Greece get the second half started. England have made a change at the break, Lewis Hall coming on for his debut. Ezri Konsa makes way. Half-time postbag. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, the only mistake in Watkins replacing Kane is that it didn\u2019t happen against Slovenia five months ago. Walker\u2019s comments about the surprise of him not being in the team says enough about the closed shop of England\u2019s first choice players. They should always have to earn it, and be dropped if they don\u2019t, all on merit\u201d \u2013 Adam Hirst \u201cDelighted with Ollie Watkins\u2019 goal and Madouke is playing out of his skin. As a Liverpool fan, I can\u2019t deny I\u2019m impressed by Tsimikas\u2019s runs on the left. By far the most enterprising Greek player so far. Hope England give Carsley a well-deserved send-off\u201d \u2013 Colum Fordham \u201cRota the single player who has destroyed the perfect list of (players and substitutes) all names ending with S. I have been following both cricket and football for most of my life and I am yet to hit that perfect jackpot. This one is the closest I recall. Was there a Bulgarian team in 1990 or 1994 with all players ending with V?\u201d \u2013 krishnamoorthy v (Yep, Bulgaria\u2019s squad at USA 94 consisted of 21 players whose surname ended either in -ov or -ev \u2026 apart from one player, Petar Mihtarski, though he only played for a grand total of one minute during his team\u2019s run to the semis.) In the other Group B2 match, the Republic of Ireland lead Finland 1-0 at half-time. Evan Ferguson with a header just before the break. As things stand, Greece maintain their lead at the top over England on the head-to-head, while Finland are relegated to League C. England and Ireland remain, respectively, in the promotion and relegation play-off places. How useful this information is, with the second half and a final round of matches still to be played, is moot. Ah what the hell, publish and be damned. Greece P5 W4 D0 L1 F9 A2 Pts12 England P5 W4 D0 L1 F9 A3 Pts12 Republic of Ireland P5 W2 D0 L3 F3 A7 Pts6 Finland P5 W0 D0 L5 F2 A11 Pts0 A good half for England, and especially for Ollie Watkins and Lee Carsley. They still need one more goal to knock Greece off their Group B2 perch, though. 45 min +2: Watkins scampers off down the middle, sent clear by Lewis. But he lets the ball clank between his feet, with Koulierakis in hot pursuit, and the chance of a second goal is gone. 45 min: There will be two minutes of additional first-half action. 44 min: Bellingham dinks a clever pass down the inside-right to release Madueke, who doesn\u2019t realise he\u2019s got the opportunity to advance on goal and shoot. Instead he checks back to ensure possession is retained and the chance is gone. 42 min: Masouras, who has already been booked, cynically tugs at an in-flight Jones. Another player who really wants to watch his step, given this referee\u2019s hair-trigger, albeit haphazard, disciplinary style. 40 min: There\u2019s some eejit pointing a laser pen at the England players, by the way. A crisp cuff around the lug wouldn\u2019t go amiss. 38 min: Masouras swings a dangerous ball in from the right. Pickford claims well, with Pavlidis rushing in. Greece giving this a really good go now. 36 min: Bakasetas batters a shot goalwards from distance. Pickford handles well. It\u2019s become a fast, open, fun game. 35 min: Tzolis tries to release Pavlidis with a raking ball down the middle. Pickford, who is in an adventurous mood tonight, races out of his box to blooter clear. 34 min: Bellingham bustles hard down the inside-right channel. He enters the box and prepares to shoot, only to have the ball whipped off his toe by Koulierakis. That\u2019s precision defending. It had to be, because any contact with Bellingham would have resulted in a penalty. Nothing comes of the resulting corner. 33 min: Masouras wins a corner down the right. Pickford punches it clear. The Olympic stadium really bouncing now. \u201cWhile I agree with Philip Cornwall that you can win trophies with an imported German manager, let\u2019s not forget that Greece won Euro 2004 almost exclusively by hanging on to a 0-1 lead for hours at a time,\u201d recalls Justin Kavanagh. \u201cSo tonight\u2019s a good test for their ability to manage out a game with Germanic efficiency.\u201d 31 min: Nothing comes of the resulting corner. Greece have finally woken up, though, and for the first time this evening, England don\u2019t have it all their own way. 30 min: Tsimikas and Tzolis combine at speed down the left. A brisk one-two, and suddenly Tsimikas is one on one with Pickford! He shoots hard from a tight angle, but Pickford sticks out a strong arm to turn around the post. That\u2019s great football all round, so long as we don\u2019t delve deep into the defensive work of Walker and Madueke. 29 min: \u2026 and then Walker needlessly clatters into Tzolis. No booking this time, which is something of a surprise given the referee\u2019s carry-on to date. 27 min: Perhaps the Hot Butter number would be better used to soundtrack the referee\u2019s yellow card. Out it pops again, this time to book Pickford for taking an age over a goal kick. Four bookings already, and not a bad challenge among them. 26 min: \u2026 but that\u2019s given Greece and their fans succour, and another attack comes along soon after. Rota cuts in from the right only to drag his shot well wide of the target. A wasted opportunity, with plenty of space having opened out in front of him. 25 min: Jones sleepwalks into trouble in the middle of the park and Greece are able to launch a rare attack. The debutant is fortunate Masouras, looking to make good down the right, runs slap-bang into Lewis. 23 min: Masouras goes into the book now, though, after knocking Jones over. This referee isn\u2019t to be messed with. A fair chance this won\u2019t end with 22 players on the pitch, and it\u2019s not been a dirty game. 21 min: Masouras clips Bellingham. Just a foul, no booking, but the resulting roar of disapproval from the Athens crowd illustrates just how frustrated the home support have become. England, who have enjoyed nearly 70 percent of possession so far, are doing a proper number on their hosts. 19 min: Madueke advances down the right and sends a weak shot straight at Vlachodimos. Then Gordon makes good along the opposite flank before running out of room. Goal kick, but England are all over Greece here. 17 min: The corner leads to a manic game of pinball that ideally would have been soundtracked by Hot Butter. Eventually the whistle goes for \u2026 well, not sure, to be honest \u2026 but that\u2019s welcome relief for Greece. 16 min: Gordon is running riot down the left. He cuts inside at speed and launches a fierce rising shot towards the top-right corner. Mavropanos bravely eyebrows the ball over the post. That may have tested the keeper otherwise. 15 min: The Greek captain Bakasetas swings the free kick in from the left. Pickford comes a long way to meet it and punches clear. That\u2019s brave and decisive goalkeeping. 14 min: Tsimikas bustles his way down the left and is skittled from behind by Gallagher, who wants to watch himself. Just a free kick, but for a second, England hearts were in mouths. 12 min: Gallagher slips a cute pass down the right for Madueke, who nearly reaches the byline again. But before he can deliver another dangerous cutback, Siopis comes across to block and clear. The small matter of two bookings aside (!) this has been an almost perfect start for England. 11 min: \u2026 maybe too much confidence, though. Bellingham thinks he\u2019s won a corner down the left, but he\u2019s not getting it, and decides to tell it as he sees it. A daft booking for gum-flapping. Then Gallagher stops Tzolis from taking a quick restart, and he goes into the book as well. All of a sudden, two members of England\u2019s engine room are on the old disciplinary tightrope. 9 min: Gordon accelerates down the left again. The door is slammed shut, though it takes three blue shirts to cut off the route to the penalty box. England continue to exude confidence. 8 min: It\u2019s been a really confident start by England, and there\u2019s their reward. Greece have hardly had a touch, other than to pick out the ball from the back of their net. Bellingham plays a reverse pass down the right to release Madueke into space. He reaches the byline and cuts back for Watkins, who can\u2019t miss from six yards. Seems Lee Carsley knows what he\u2019s doing. Harry who? 6 min: England stroke it around patiently. Tsimikas eventually tires of it and skittles Madueke. Then from the resulting free kick \u2026 4 min: England need to win this game if they\u2019re to have a chance of finishing top of the group. They need to match or better Greece\u2019s 2-1 scoreline also. With this in mind, on ITV, the commentating team of Sam Matterface and Lee Dixon have already mentioned the benched Harry Kane over 800 times. 2 min: Gordon outpaces Rota down the left. His low cross dribbles all the way through to Madueke, who attempts a snapshot from the penalty spot but can\u2019t get anything away. That\u2019s a fine run by Gordon and a promising start for England. England get the ball rolling. Plenty of boos as they do so. Hey, it is nearly pantomime season, after all. The teams are out. Greece in blue, England in white, the Olympic Stadium of Athens already on the boil. We\u2019ll be off in a minute! Greece\u2019s Euro 2004 heroes, led by Otto Rehhagel, are paraded on the pitch. Partly so they can be honoured with more shiny trinkets, partly for crowd-up-whipping purposes. \u201cYou can win trophies with an imported German manager,\u201d notes our man Philip Cornwall, at the scene for the purposes of leisure rather than work, but already planning ahead for 2026. England\u2019s stand-in captain Kyle Walker talks to ITV. \u201cObviously you turn up and expect [Harry Kane] to be playing \u2026 the manager has made a decision and we have to stick by that as a group of lads \u2026 this is a game you want to be involved in \u2026 we take points off them and we\u2019ve a good chance of finishing top \u2026 these are the games you want to be involved in for your country \u2026 with Harry being on the bench [Jude Bellingham] needs to take front mantelpiece and get some goals tonight \u2026 momentum to take into Sunday [against Ireland] as well \u2026 there was a lot of emotion [at Wembley] with the very sad news of George Baldock dying \u2026 they played for him, really \u2026 we need to make sure we quieten the crowd down \u2026 hopefully get a result.\u201d Lee Carsley speaks to ITV. \u201cIt was important to give Ollie Watkins the opportunity to experience a night like this \u2026 this team needs to try to create leaders and one way of doing that is giving them the opportunity \u2026 [Harry Kane] is fine \u2026 he obviously wants to play but his attitude has been fantastic \u2026 it\u2019s important we give the players the chance \u2026 Curtis Jones is an all-round very good midfielder \u2026 he\u2019ll play a little bit deeper tonight than he currently does with Liverpool \u2026 hopefully our performance will be better [than against Greece at Wembley] \u2026 it\u2019s important we match Greece for tempo and energy \u2026 the goal is to win the World Cup so this will be a valuable experience for them and hopefully develop them.\u201d No fewer than eight Greece players are in danger of missing their last match in Finland if they pick up a yellow card tonight. Five of those men start - Vangelis Pavlidis, Christos Zafeiris, Christos Tzolis, Kostas Tsimikas and Manolis Siopis \u2013 while another three are on the bench (Dimitris Pelkas, Giannis Konstantelias and Dimitris Giannoulis). Not a single England player is walking the disciplinary tightrope ahead of the Wembley showdown with Ireland. A reminder of how Group B2 looks. England have to win tonight to retain a chance of finishing the group on top and gaining automatic promotion. Greece need just a point this evening to guarantee they\u2019ll finish first and go up; in that scenario, their victory at Wembley means they\u2019d pip England on the head-to-head. Greece P4 W4 D0 L0 F9 A1 Pts12 England P4 W3 D0 L1 F8 A3 Pts9 Republic of Ireland P4 W1 D0 L3 F2 A7 Pts3 Finland P4 W0 D0 L4 F2 A10 Pts0 England, as a harrumphing Harry Kane has noted, are already without Bukayo Saka, Declan Rice, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Cole Palmer, Phil Foden, Jack Grealish, Levi Colwill, Jarrad Branthwaite and Aaron Ramsdale. They\u2019re also without Kane in their starting XI. He\u2019s on the bench \u2013 injury is reportedly not a factor - with Kyle Walker taking over captain\u2019s duties. Noni Madueke starts for the first time while Curtis Jones makes his debut. Greece make two changes to the starting XI they named for the 2-1 win at Wembley. Kostas Tsimikas of Liverpool and Christos Zafeiris are in for Dimitris Giannoulis and Dimitrios Kourbelis. Greece: Vlachodimos, Rota, Mavropanos, Koulierakis, Tsimikas, Siopis, Zaferis, Masouras, Bakasetas, Tzolis, Pavlidis. Subs: Tzolakis, Mandas, Vagiannidis, Retsos, Alexandropoulos, Ioannidis, Douvikas, Pelkas, Hatzidiakos, Konstantelias, Mantalos, Giannoulis. England: Pickford, Walker, Konsa, Gu\u00e9hi, Lewis, Jones, Gallagher, Bellingham, Madueke, Gordon, Watkins. Subs: Trafford, Henderson, Gibbs-White, Gomes, Kane, Hall, Livramento, Quansah, Harwood-Bellis, Rogers, Bowen, Solanke. Referee: Daniel Siebert (Germany) VAR: Bastian Dankert (Germany) England captain Harry Kane has gone public with his displeasure over the number of withdrawals from the squad. He also might be a shock omission from tonight\u2019s starting XI. What a savage irony. Kick-off is at 7.45pm GMT. It\u2019s on!",

I have beautiful people around me who support me daily, which for me is really important. I try to enjoy my time on the court. \u201cThe atmosphere here is amazing, so I\u2019m just trying to play some good tennis this week. Let\u2019s see what\u2019s coming in the next round.\u201d Sinner will face the runner-up from the John Newcombe Group, a spot currently occupied by Casper Ruud. The Norwegian faces Andrey Rublev in the concluding match of that group on Friday while Alexander Zverev plays Carlos Alcaraz. Sinner is joined in the semi-finals by Fritz, who overcame De Minaur 5-7 6-4 6-3 in a match lasting two hours and eight minutes. And with Sinner safely through to the semi-finals, to the delight of the home crowd, that\u2019s it from me today. Thanks for your company. Good night! As the lights go off in Turin, let\u2019s look to tomorrow, the final day of the round-robin. Alexander Zverev and Carlos Alcaraz walk on court at 1pm GMT; Casper Ruud and Andrey Rublev at 7.30pm GMT, to decide who will join Sinner and Fritz in Saturday\u2019s semi-finals. Similarly, the doubles pairings must fight it out to join Heliovaara /Patten and M. Purcell /Thompson in the knock out stages. Rohan Bopanna/Matthew Ebden and Kevin Krawietz/Tim Puetz are first on court at 10.30am GMT; Marcelo Arevalo/ Mate Pavic and Simone Bolelli/Andrea Vavassori sandwiched between the doubles matches at 5pm GMT. Henman has now tracked Sinner down. \u201cWe know each other very well. I was serving better than the previous two matches. I switched up with the serve and volley and it didn\u2019t work that well but otherwise it was a high-quality match. \u201c I have no preference who I play in the semi-final, whoever is going to play on the other side of the net, I will play my best tennis. I will watch tomorrow, I am also a tennis fan.\u201d \u201cA solid performance from Sinner\u201d says Laura Robson, \u201cwithout being his best performance of the week.\u201d In the crowd lots of people are still in their seats holding fluffy carrots and hoping for an autograph. In a bit of filler, Tim Henman is now being interviewed about the mixed zone, while standing in the mixed zone. Luckily everyone decides this is a bad idea and we quickly return court side to Salmon and Robson who think that some elements of Medvedev\u2019s game have slipped over the last few months. Jannik Sinner is talking (if reluctantly)\u201cI am trying to win as many matches as I can, me and Danni know each other very well and each time we try to change tactically. \u201cI know what I have achieved during this year, I try to step on court with a good mindset and have a good team, try to enjoy it here and off court I am trying to prepare in the best possible way.\u201d They shake hands affectionately at the net. Medvedev picks up his bag and slinks off, while Sinner whips off his shirt and towels down. The stats tell the story despite some magical moments from Medvedev : 30 unforced errors by Medvedev to ten from Sinner. Sinner finishes top of the Ilie Nastase group, followed by Fritz, (both qualify) with Medvedev and then De Minaur following behind. Second set: Sinner 6-4, 6-3 Medvedev (*denotes next server) The crowd are hushed by the umpire. A feisty return off Sinner\u2019s first serve is just out. But an up and at em forehand by Medvedev proves Sinner isn\u2019t going to have this final game all his own way . Sinner follows up a strong first serve to inch ahead, then Medvdev draws even with another early return, a whippy backhand beating a diving Sinner. But it feels inevitable and the match is Sinner\u2019s when Medvedev twice hits long. Second set: Sinner* 5-4, 6-3 Medvedev (*denotes next server) Loose from Medvedev, his fifteenth backhand unforced error. But he comes back to win a tit-for-tat rally with a smash, and a second long rally as Sinner nets. Medvedev breathes heavily . Another brilliant rally at deuce, awesome defence from Medvedev but Sinner outsmarts him and goes on to break again. Sinner serving for the match. Second set: Sinner 4-4, 6-3 Medvedev* (*denotes next server) A sensational return by Medvedev wins the first point and continues his sudden touch perfect form. But someone turns Sinner back on again and he duly comes back to win the game. Second set: Sinner* 3-4, 6-3 Medvedev (*denotes next server) Who doesn\u2019t love a bit of marauding Medvedev? He follows up breaking serve by whistling through an immense service game to love. Some beautiful pictures of Turin at night to make us jealous. Second set: Sinner* 3-3, 6-3 Medvedev (*denotes next server) Medvedev with a brilliant one two, returning serve from nearly in the crowd and then recovering to win the point with a stonking back hand. Goes 15-40 up with a drop shot and two break points. Sinner saves the first but not the second after Medvedev comes up on top in a fierce rally. Second set: Sinner* 3-2, 6-3 Medvedev (*denotes next server) Medvedev throws in a massive winning serve. Sinner counters with a short-jab passing shot. Sinner fluffs his lines and Medvedev holds. They have a sit down and a towel up, the lights go down the flashing lights come on and the crowd have a dance. Second set: Sinner 3-1, 6-3 Medvedev *(*denotes next server) Hit and hope is how the commentator describes Medvedev\u2019s play, but luckily for him Sinner is having a slightly mouldy service game. They draw even at 30-30, but Medvedev can\u2019t take advantage and Sinner draws further ahead. Second set: Sinner *2-1, 6-3 Medvedev (*denotes next server) A mid-air Karate Kid forehand on the line from Medvdev brings huge applause from the crowd, but he follows it up with a limp waft into the net. Then a big serve to even things up before Sinner pounces on a Medvedev drop volley and sends the ball back past his nose. A break already, and the crowd can sense victory. Second set: Sinner 1-1, 6-3 Medvedev* (*denotes next server) That first set win also ensures that Sinner finished the round robin in first place. He duly whizzes through his service game, Medvedev quite wayward with his shot-making. Second set: Sinner* 0-1, 6-3 Medvedev (*denotes next server) Will Medvedev give up? No he won\u2019t! A couple of big serves, a volley exchange at the net and an easy hold. First set: Sinner 6-3 Medvedev*(*denotes next server) Sinner serving not only to win the set but to knock Medvedev out of the semi-finals and hand the place to Taylor Fritz . An ace hands him three set points and he takes the first with a killer serve at 12 o\u2019clock. Seventeen unforced errors for Medvedev in that first set sealing his fate. First set: Sinner* 5-3 Medvedev*(*denotes next server) Medvedev, hair sticking up like a baby bird, goes 15-30 down again. Then 15-40. His serve is starting to wobble under the pressure and he sends a forehand into the net for his third unforced error and hands Sinner the break. First set: Sinner 4-3 Medvedev* (*denotes next server) After the previous hard fought service game, Sinner wins to love. Collecting the final point when Medvedev gets an ungenerous net cord. Sinner has only dropped two points on serve so far. First set: Sinner* 3-3 Medvedev (*denotes next server) Medvedev swatting those huge ground strokes from the base line. But for the first time Sinner wins two points against serve, and then three. But from 15-40 down, Medvedev pulls back to deuce, Sinner misdirecting a forehand. A second deuce, Medvedev racing through each point, not waiting for the crowd applause to settle, and pulls the game out of the bag. First set: Sinner 3-2 Medvedev* (*denotes next server) Some pin-point placement by Sinner sends Medvedev running from side to side in an attempt to stay in the rally and he eventually hits out. Sinner continues to miss the odd first serve but still wins to 15 . And there is 1980s hearthrob Stefan Edberg in the crowd with his wife. Broke many teenage girls hearts. First set: Sinner* 2-2 Medvedev (*denotes next server) Medvedev\u2019s third ace, followed by an awkward approach to the net and a drive volley, Sinner lobs from behind his back but it falls just long. Another easy service win. First set: Sinner 2-1 Medvedev* (*denotes next server) Both players on point with their serve this evening, Sinner starting with another banger. He\u2019s in his trademark white baseball cap, navy polo shirt and big white tennis boots at the bottom of those long legs. Medvedev approaches the net and it works to bring him one point, but Sinner still wins to 15. First set: Sinner* 1-1 Medvedev (*denotes next server) Medvedev, in geranium-red shirt and trainers, starts with an ace, then wins a big bass-line exchange. Polishes things off with another ace. First set: Sinner 1-0 Medvedev* (*denotes next server) An easy win to love in about 30 seconds, as Sinner\u2019s coach nervously bites his nails. No titles for Medvedev this year for the first time since 2017; Sinner has collected seven, including the US and Australian Open. It feels like it should be a formality for the No.1 seed. We shall find out. Sinner has the ball and prepares to serve. Here come the players, both in subdued tracksuit tops, hand in hand with a ball boy/girl who carries an enormous tennis ball. Sinner bounces about as the umpire runs through the pleasantries, Medvedev calls correctly and will receive. In the head to heads, both Sinner and Medvedev have won matches seven apiece, with Sinner dominating recently (with the exception of Wimbledon). The commentators agree, they look at Medvedev and don\u2019t know quite how it works, but it does. Which Medvedev will turn up today? The chilled exquisite stroke player of the match against Alex de Minaur or the mercurial racket-thrower who played Taylor Fritz? Either way, he will have to cope with the partisan crowd AND win in straight sets to qualify for the semi-finals. There\u2019s about half an hour till Sinner v Medvedev \u2013 the semi-final decider. Some great detail from Gigi Salmon who reports that Sinner is currently eating ice cream and playing cards, while Medvedev is eating pasta and watching football. After such an epic opening set, Purcell and Thompson hurry through the second, to become the first Australian duo through to the ATP finals semi-finals since 1999. Tumaini Carayol is in Malaga, where he spoke to Emma Raducanu about her struggles with fitness. And there was good news for Britain\u2019s Henry Patten. He and doubles partner Harri Helivaara beat Wesley Koolhof &amp; Nikola Mektic 4-6, 6-3, 12-10 to swing into the semis undefeated. There\u2019s currently a dramatic doubles match in play in Turin. After a 20- minute tie break, Max Purcell and Jordan Thompson won the first set against Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos 16-14. The win means they are through to the semis (they only needed one set). Granollers and Zeballos are distraught. And I should have said that last year\u2019s losing finalist Sinner is already through to the knock-out stages, thanks to de Minaur winning the first set against Fritz. Earlier today, America\u2019s Taylor Fritz fought back after losing the first set to Australia\u2019s Alex de Minaur, in the longest match of the week. Fritz pocketed the win: 7-5, 6-4, 6-3, and will make the semi-finals on Saturday unless Medvedev beats Sinner in straight sets. Yes, we\u2019ve reached that logarithmic tables time of the tournament. Good evening! It\u2019s day five of the ATP tour finals, the penultimate day of the round robin competition. Our match of the evening is Jannik Sinner against Daniil Medvedev, which is due to spring into squeaky-booted action around 7pm GMT. Tickets for the finals have been selling like the hottest of hot cakes in Turin, with home boy Sinner, the Orange Fox, the most dazzlingly golden ticket of them all. Sinner is still floating under a cloud of controversy after he tested positive for small amounts of clostebol in March. The International Tennis Integrity Agency independent panel verdict was that Sinner bore \u201cno fault or negligence\u201d, but WADA appealed the decision with CAS. To his fans though, he is an Italian tennis miracle - expect huge enthusiasm and orange wigs from the stadium.",

Kennedy became one of Trump\u2019s top surrogates during the campaign, which came as a surprise to some observers as he is the scion of a famous Democratic dynasty and has had a long history of environmental activism often in causes to which Trump will probably do great damage. Kennedy has also become well-known for his anti-vaccine beliefs and embrace of other conspiracy theories around health and wellness issues. Trump has previously said he will let Kennedy \u201cgo wild on food\u201d and \u201cgo wild on medicines\u201d if re-elected, as well as wanting him to take care of women\u2019s health. There has also been speculation he may be given influence over children\u2019s health, too, which would particularly alarm proponents of vaccines.

Shares of the vaccine makers Moderna, Pfizer and Novavax tumbled after news of Trump\u2019s decision was first reported, Bloomberg reported. Kennedy\u2019s independent presidential campaign was marked by at times bizarre scandals that ranged from the revelation that part of his brain had been eaten by a worm to admitting to staging a dead bear corpse in Central Park as the victim of a hit-and-run accident. Kennedy\u2019s nomination to Trump\u2019s government is likely to boost already strong fears that he is keen on appointing extremists and loyalists to his administration rather than experts and technocrats.

      "bodyText": "Activists have called on Caribbean governments to halt the mass deportation of Haitians fleeing escalating gang violence that has claimed thousands of lives and displaced hundreds of thousands of people. In the past month, tens of thousands of people have been deported to Haiti, including 61,000 from the neighbouring Dominican Republic, whose president recently pledged to deport 10,000 migrants a week. In October, the US deported 258 Haitians, while Turks &amp; Caicos, Jamaica and the Bahamas deported a combined total of 231, according to Sam Guillaume, a spokesperson for Haiti\u2019s Support Group for Returnees and Refugees. Activists and human rights organisations in the Caribbean say they are concerned about \u201cdraconian\u201d deportation measures and argue that refugees who are returned to Haiti will simply join the estimated 700,000 people who were left homeless by the continuing conflict. \u201cA lot of them can\u2019t make it back home because their neighbourhood is controlled by gangs,\u201d said Guillaume. Those held for deportation in the Dominican Republic are being forced into crowded jails with no water, no food and no beds, and are sometimes teargassed when they protest over their treatment, Guillaume said. \u201cPeople are being treated like criminals,\u201d he said. The allegations were denied by Julio Caraballo, a spokesman for the Dominican Republic\u2019s migration office, who said deportations were carried out with \u201crespect for the physical integrity of detainees, with respect for human rights and with dignity\u201d, adding that meals and medical attention were provided to those detained. In Jamaica, international human rights lawyer Malene Alleyne, who is supporting Haitian asylum seekers, also raised concerns about the processing of refugee cases. Alleyne said that refugees had told her of their fears of being returned to a \u201cwar zone\u201d. \u201cJamaica has adopted a draconian approach that\u2019s based on collective expulsion without assessing in an individualised way their protection needs and their risk of persecution on their return to Haiti, and so we have children and women who would have protection needs being sent back without due process and without an opportunity to speak with an attorney at law,\u201d she said. Jamaica\u2019s minister of national security, Horace Chang, said immigration authorities were following the country\u2019s laws. \u201cIt\u2019s not a government\u2019s stance, it\u2019s the law of the land. If you come here illegally and you\u2019re not landed, they return you to your country. The law of the land says to me if the immigration authorities find a reason not to land them because they are here illegally, you send them back to their country. They do it to Americans, Colombians, Azerbaijan [nationals] \u2013 because we have had one \u2013 and we do it to the Cubans. We have sent home 17 Cubans,\u201d he said. Alleyne called for a regional approach to dealing with the mass exodus of people from Haiti, which is expected to rise amid a surge in violence despite the arrival of a Kenyan-led international policing mission earlier this year. As gangs increase their control of Port-au-Prince and the country\u2019s main airport, scenes of desperate families packing up to seek refuge are becoming more common in the embattled county. Alleyne\u2019s human rights organisation, Freedom Imaginaries, is campaigning for the Caribbean intergovernmental body, Caricom, to establish a framework to deal with asylum and refugee cases in line with humanitarian assistance principles. She said: \u201cWe need an asylum procedure that allows us to screen people properly so that people with legitimate claims aren\u2019t collectively expelled with others, and a multi-stakeholder approach that brings together government agencies, civil society international community, and, importantly, Caricom because this is not something that can be solved by any one actor acting alone, it has to be a region rights-based comprehensive approach.\u201d",

Low-income drivers will get discounts, Hochul said, and the fee will also drop after 9pm to encourage late-night deliveries.</p> <p>\u201cIt will drive down gridlock and emissions as intended,\u201d the governor, a Democrat, said. \u201cI might not always take the easy path, but I will take the right path for the people of this great state now and into the future.\u201d</p> <p>The plan is expected to be approved by New York\u2019s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) and the outgoing administration of Joe Biden, which has been supportive of the idea and needs to sign off on it before Trump re-enters the White House on 20 January, making it harder for Trump to kill it off.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>Implementing congestion pricing will be a major win for the future of New York\u2019s transportation system, cleaner air, and the governor\u2019s climate legacy,\u201d said Justin Balik, senior state program director at Evergreen Action, an environmental group.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>The incoming Trump administration poses a serious and immediate risk to the country\u2019s climate progress, and Governor Hochul is moving to safeguard New York\u2019s ability to meet climate goals.\u201d</p> <p>New York state lawmakers first legislated congestion pricing in 2019, targeting Manhattan below 60th Street, with the aim of funding the ailing MTA and helping ease the dire traffic that routinely snarls the most public transport-rich city in the US. About 700,000 vehicles <a href=\"https://congestionreliefzone.mta.info/about\">enter the lower half of Manhattan each day</a>, often at a crawl \u2013 the average travel speed is now around 7mph, down from about 9mph 15 years ago.</p> <p>\u201cNew Yorkers want cleaner air, safer streets and public transit that works for them,\u201d said Janno Lieber, chief executive of the MTA. \u201cThe basics of human existence are at stake here,\u201d he added, pointing out that ambulances and police cars are often held up by the traffic.</p> <p>The city was seen as the ideal first American staging ground for an idea embraced by numerous other places around the world \u2013 about half of New York City households do not have a car, with 85% of commuters to Manhattan <a href=\"https://new.mta.info/document/111106#page=81\">using</a> the city\u2019s network of subways, trains and buses to get there. It was originally estimated that only 1.5% of all commuters under the plan would pay the full fee.</p> <p>But congestion pricing has been unpopular within areas of New York where public transport is sparse, as well as farther-flung places where commuters into the city typically arrive by car. Phil Murphy, governor of New Jersey, has sued to halt the plan and opposition to the new iteration has already surfaced among New York\u2019s Republican representatives.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>Congestion pricing is nothing more than a scheme to squeeze more money out of New Yorkers,\u201d said Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican whose congressional district includes New York City\u2019s Staten Island.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>This isn\u2019t about reducing traffic; it\u2019s about funding a mismanaged and bloated MTA at the expense of hard-working families.\u201d</p>",

Kathy Hochul, the New York governor, in June halted a landmark plan to charge $15 for drivers entering Manhattan\u2019s traffic-clogged streets, sparking a furious backlash from transport and climate advocates. But a week after Donald Trump, who earlier this year vowed on the campaign trail to quickly \u201cterminate\u201d congestion pricing in his New York City home town, won the US presidency, Hochul announced she was resurrecting the charge, albeit at a lower price. \u201cNo New Yorker should pay a penny more than absolutely necessary and $15 was simply too much,\u201d Hochul said on Thursday, citing the rising costs New Yorkers face for rent, food and childcare. The revised system, to start in January, will generate $15bn to aid a major overhaul of New York\u2019s creaking public transport system, funding repairs to a decrepit subway and bringing a fleet of new electric buses online for underserved parts of the city. Low-income drivers will get discounts, Hochul said, and the fee will also drop after 9pm to encourage late-night deliveries. \u201cIt will drive down gridlock and emissions as intended,\u201d the governor, a Democrat, said. \u201cI might not always take the easy path, but I will take the right path for the people of this great state now and into the future.\u201d The plan is expected to be approved by New York\u2019s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) and the outgoing administration of Joe Biden, which has been supportive of the idea and needs to sign off on it before Trump re-enters the White House on 20 January, making it harder for Trump to kill it off. \u201cImplementing congestion pricing will be a major win for the future of New York\u2019s transportation system, cleaner air, and the governor\u2019s climate legacy,\u201d said Justin Balik, senior state program director at Evergreen Action, an environmental group. \u201cThe incoming Trump administration poses a serious and immediate risk to the country\u2019s climate progress, and Governor Hochul is moving to safeguard New York\u2019s ability to meet climate goals.\u201d New York state lawmakers first legislated congestion pricing in 2019, targeting Manhattan below 60th Street, with the aim of funding the ailing MTA and helping ease the dire traffic that routinely snarls the most public transport-rich city in the US. About 700,000 vehicles enter the lower half of Manhattan each day, often at a crawl \u2013 the average travel speed is now around 7mph, down from about 9mph 15 years ago. \u201cNew Yorkers want cleaner air, safer streets and public transit that works for them,\u201d said Janno Lieber, chief executive of the MTA. \u201cThe basics of human existence are at stake here,\u201d he added, pointing out that ambulances and police cars are often held up by the traffic. The city was seen as the ideal first American staging ground for an idea embraced by numerous other places around the world \u2013 about half of New York City households do not have a car, with 85% of commuters to Manhattan using the city\u2019s network of subways, trains and buses to get there. It was originally estimated that only 1.5% of all commuters under the plan would pay the full fee. But congestion pricing has been unpopular within areas of New York where public transport is sparse, as well as farther-flung places where commuters into the city typically arrive by car. Phil Murphy, governor of New Jersey, has sued to halt the plan and opposition to the new iteration has already surfaced among New York\u2019s Republican representatives. \u201cCongestion pricing is nothing more than a scheme to squeeze more money out of New Yorkers,\u201d said Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican whose congressional district includes New York City\u2019s Staten Island. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about reducing traffic; it\u2019s about funding a mismanaged and bloated MTA at the expense of hard-working families.\u201d",

A 44-year-old Turkish national was arrested on Wednesday after arriving at Schiphol airport, the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency said. The suspect was due to be extradited to Belgium to face charges of being involved in human trafficking as part of a criminal organisation. The man is suspected of supplying engines and boats to cross-Channel smugglers, shipping the boats from Turkey and storing them in Germany until they were transported to northern France. Hundreds of engines are believed to have been supplied by the man to gangs in France, a government source said, adding that he has been pursued by the authorities for months. The arrest follows a joint investigation by the National Crime Agency and investigators in the Netherlands and Belgium. Rob Jones, the NCA\u2019s director general, said: \u201cThis arrest marks an important milestone in one of the NCA\u2019s most significant investigations into organised immigration crime. \u201cWe suspect that this individual is a major supplier of boats and engines to the smugglers operating in Belgium and northern France.\u201d He said the vessels and engines used in Channel crossing were \u201chighly dangerous and completely unfit for open water\u201d.

Mismanaged plastic waste, which leaches into the environment and can be harmful to health, will double to 121m tonnes by 2050 if limits are not placed on the production of plastic, according to Samuel Pottinger, the lead author of the research. Annual greenhouse gas emissions from the plastic system will increase by 37% over the same period if the world does not place some restrictions on plastic production. But combining four measures; a global cap on plastic production, investing in waste infrastructure, using a packaging tax and a recycling mandate could reduce mismanaged plastic waste by up to 91% by 2050, and decrease plastics-related emissions by about a third, the research has found. The study was published in the journal Science, before UN treaty talks in Busan, South Korea, which present the final chance for countries to agree on how to cut plastic pollution. The talks are on a knife edge with lobbyists for plastic producers and some countries objecting to the treaty including a cap or cuts to production. All four interventions highlighted as significant in the research are being considered in the draft treaty and will be part of the discussions on 25 November. Pottinger, of the University of California, Berkeley, said: \u201cThe stated goal of the treaty is to end plastic pollution.

      "body": "<p>Ireland\u2019s imminent general election on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/06/taoiseach-announces-irish-general-election-to-take-place-in-23-days\">29 November</a> has aroused little interest in Britain. Many here may not even know it is taking place. No surprise there, unfortunately. It was ever thus for Britain\u2019s insular political class. Compared with the attention lavished on the American election, albeit this year an exceptionally important one, the Irish election has barely registered. But is what happens in Wisconsin really more important for Britain than what happens in <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2024/11/07/election-2024-wicklow-constituency-profile/\">Wicklow</a>? Centuries of history suggest the opposite.</p> <p>It does not, however, require specialist knowledge of Irish politics to see why the Fine Gael taoiseach, Simon Harris, has called a snap election in just two weeks\u2019 time. The previous D\u00e1il, elected in 2020, could in theory have remained in existence until next March. But Mr Harris, who succeeded Leo Varadkar as his party\u2019s leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/09/simon-harris-pledges-new-energy-after-becoming-ireland-youngest-taoiseach\">in April</a>, has long wanted a contest this month. He has gone to the country now because he sees it as Fine Gael\u2019s best chance.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2024_Irish_general_election\">latest polls</a> suggest Mr Harris is right. At the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Irish_general_election\">last election</a>, in 2020, the country\u2019s dominant centre-right parties, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il, both did badly. Their combined vote share hit a historic low. Sinn F\u00e9in, by contrast, made a spectacular advance, gaining the largest share of the vote. It was not enough to give the party a seat in government. To keep Sinn F\u00e9in out of power, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il eventually formed a coalition with the Greens.</p> <p>Until recently, the coalition\u2019s attempts to marginalise Sinn F\u00e9in seemed not to succeed. That has changed. In local and European elections <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/10/disappointment-for-sinn-fein-as-irish-local-elections-bolster-coalition\">in June</a>, Sinn&nbsp;F\u00e9in\u2019s vote share fell by half. Criticism of its leader, Mary Lou McDonald, has grown as she struggles to balance the interests of the party\u2019s traditional republican supporters and newer adherents. Large losses this time would be a serious blow.</p> <p>The past four years have tested every European country, Ireland included. But the <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/2024/11/08/fintan-otoole-on-election-2024-a-half-built-nation-goes-unhappy-to-the-polls/\">coalition</a> government has done well. Ireland handled Covid better than the UK under Boris Johnson. It also navigated the disruption of Brexit with skill and clarity \u2013 another contrast. Above all, the Irish economy has boomed, thanks to attracting inward investment that feeds a powerful export market. In his pre-election <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/irish-finance-minister-calls-14bn-tax-windfall-from-apple-transformational\">budget statement</a> last month, the finance minister even announced a government surplus and big welfare hikes, things that Rachel Reeves would jump at the chance to emulate.</p> <p>Yet beneath the boom, and despite the budget sweeteners, social problems in Ireland have deepened, in particular in housing and health. The country\u2019s high GDP-per-head figure masks deep inequalities. As in Britain, young families face increasingly uphill struggles to enter the housing market. Unsurprisingly, the parties are promising to reverse <a href=\"https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/elections-2024/editorial-to-get-the-government-we-deserve-we-must-engage-with-election-process/a2024020511.html\">the shortages</a>. Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il both pledge to build 300,000 new houses by 2030. Sinn F\u00e9in pledges 370,000.</p> <p>Predicting election results under Ireland\u2019s proportional representation voting system is hazardous. That is more true than ever this time. There were 12 parties in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33rd_D%C3%A1il\">D\u00e1il </a>when it was dissolved for the election, along with 19 independents. Major boundary changes and a larger D\u00e1il may produce even greater diversity this time. Another coalition seems likely after the votes are counted. Yet one thing is certain. With important aspects of Brexit still not fully resolved, and 26 years on from the Good Friday agreement, every Irish election has the capacity to shape British politics too.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ireland\u2019s imminent general election on 29 November has aroused little interest in Britain. Many here may not even know it is taking place. No surprise there, unfortunately. It was ever thus for Britain\u2019s insular political class. Compared with the attention lavished on the American election, albeit this year an exceptionally important one, the Irish election has barely registered. But is what happens in Wisconsin really more important for Britain than what happens in Wicklow? Centuries of history suggest the opposite. It does not, however, require specialist knowledge of Irish politics to see why the Fine Gael taoiseach, Simon Harris, has called a snap election in just two weeks\u2019 time. The previous D\u00e1il, elected in 2020, could in theory have remained in existence until next March. But Mr Harris, who succeeded Leo Varadkar as his party\u2019s leader in April, has long wanted a contest this month. He has gone to the country now because he sees it as Fine Gael\u2019s best chance. The latest polls suggest Mr Harris is right. At the last election, in 2020, the country\u2019s dominant centre-right parties, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il, both did badly. Their combined vote share hit a historic low. Sinn F\u00e9in, by contrast, made a spectacular advance, gaining the largest share of the vote. It was not enough to give the party a seat in government. To keep Sinn F\u00e9in out of power, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il eventually formed a coalition with the Greens. Until recently, the coalition\u2019s attempts to marginalise Sinn F\u00e9in seemed not to succeed. That has changed. In local and European elections in June, Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s vote share fell by half. Criticism of its leader, Mary Lou McDonald, has grown as she struggles to balance the interests of the party\u2019s traditional republican supporters and newer adherents. Large losses this time would be a serious blow. The past four years have tested every European country, Ireland included. But the coalition government has done well. Ireland handled Covid better than the UK under Boris Johnson. It also navigated the disruption of Brexit with skill and clarity \u2013 another contrast. Above all, the Irish economy has boomed, thanks to attracting inward investment that feeds a powerful export market. In his pre-election budget statement last month, the finance minister even announced a government surplus and big welfare hikes, things that Rachel Reeves would jump at the chance to emulate. Yet beneath the boom, and despite the budget sweeteners, social problems in Ireland have deepened, in particular in housing and health. The country\u2019s high GDP-per-head figure masks deep inequalities. As in Britain, young families face increasingly uphill struggles to enter the housing market. Unsurprisingly, the parties are promising to reverse the shortages. Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il both pledge to build 300,000 new houses by 2030. Sinn F\u00e9in pledges 370,000. Predicting election results under Ireland\u2019s proportional representation voting system is hazardous. That is more true than ever this time. There were 12 parties in the D\u00e1il when it was dissolved for the election, along with 19 independents. Major boundary changes and a larger D\u00e1il may produce even greater diversity this time. Another coalition seems likely after the votes are counted. Yet one thing is certain. With important aspects of Brexit still not fully resolved, and 26 years on from the Good Friday agreement, every Irish election has the capacity to shape British politics too.",

Sharif said: \u201cI never intended to do that.\u201d Emlyn Jones said: \u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019ve realised that you\u2019re admitting murder,\u201d to which Sharif said he had not intended to kill Sara. \u201cYou are still trying to get away with murder,\u201d Emyln Jones said. \u201cYou\u2019re having to backpedal from yesterday\u2019s admission.\u201d Sharif responded: \u201cMy daughter died, I take full responsibility.\u201d Emyln Jones put it to Sharif that it did not seem like he was taking full responsibility: \u201cIt feels like you\u2019re wriggling.\u201d Sharif replied: \u201cI take full responsibility that she died because of my actions, but I did not want to kill her.\u201d Emlyn Jones suggested that by the \u201cdramatic change\u201d in his account Sharif had altered his plan from blaming his wife and brother for Sara\u2019s death to now trying to protect them. He said: \u201cYour new plan, your plan B so to speak, in this case involves covering for Mr Malik. And are you covering for Ms Batool?\u201d Sharif replied: \u201cI have been selfish blaming other people for something they did not do.\u201d Sharif said he did not know how Sara sustained burns. Emlyn Jones said: \u201cIf you didn\u2019t burn her with an iron and pour boiling water on her feet, we have more than one abuser in the house.\u201d Sharif said: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Sharif, Batool and Malik all deny murder and causing or allowing the death of a child. The trial continues.",

      "bodyText": "Diplomatic officials and their dependents in the UK allegedly committed offences including sexual assault, possession of indecent images of children, and indecent exposure last year, a Foreign Office minister has said. Catherine West told parliament of nine serious offences allegedly committed by individuals with diplomatic immunity in 2023, and gave an update on fines and taxes owed by diplomatic missions. An Iraqi individual is accused of possession or distribution of indecent images of children. Diplomats from Ghana, Libya and Mongolia have been accused of assault. There was an allegation of indecent exposure against a Portuguese individual, and an individual from Singapore was accused of child cruelty or neglect. The annual list includes other alleged incidents including driving without insurance and further accusations of sexual assault. About 26,500 people in the UK are entitled to diplomatic or international organisation-related immunity. The Foreign Office defines serious crimes as offences that carry a jail term of a year or more, as well as serious driving offences. Where diplomats are alleged to have committed serious crimes, the Foreign Office asks their government or international organisation to waive diplomatic immunity, and where this is not granted they can ask the diplomat or dependent to leave the UK. The most high-profile case in recent years has been the death of Harry Dunn, a motorcyclist who was hit by a car driven by Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US diplomat. West said the vast majority of diplomats and dependents abided by UK law. She said the Foreign Office \u201cdoes not tolerate foreign diplomats or dependants breaking the law\u201d and added: \u201cWe take all allegations of illegal activity seriously.\u201d The Metropolitan police, the force most likely to investigate such allegations because Britain\u2019s diplomatic hub is in London, have been approached for comment. Between 2019 and 2022, 15 serious and significant offences were allegedly committed by people entitled to diplomatic or international organisation-related immunity in the UK. These included alleged sexual assault, common assault, domestic servitude and driving under the influence of alcohol. West said fines and taxes owed by diplomatic missions included \u00a3152,436,135 in unpaid congestion charges from the scheme\u2019s introduction in 2003 until September 2024. She said the US owed \u00a315,160,275, Japan owed \u00a310,422,558 and China \u00a39,303,180. Embassies owed \u00a34,142,255 in business rates, with the Chinese embassy accounting for the most at \u00a3646,183. Saudi Arabia ranked the highest for parking fines as of the end of June, accounting for \u00a3196,630 of the \u00a31,489,618 total owed by diplomats. Transport for London has previously said the congestion charge is a \u201ccharge for a service and not a tax\u201d and diplomats are not exempt from paying it.

Only 12 months ago the fashion group was boasting about how it had just <a href=\"https://www.burberryplc.com/content/dam/burberryplc/corporate/images/old/Burberry%20H1%20FY24%20Press%20Release%20161123.pdf.downloadasset.pdf\">completed a \u00a3400m buyback</a>, its second of that size in two years. Now, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/14/burberry-turnaround-chief-40m-cuts-scarf-bar-rollout-shares\">after a stunning collapse in profits</a>, the company can\u2019t even afford to give its shareholders a dividend and the (inevitably) new chief executive is talking about the need to \u201ccourse correct\u201d and stabilise the business \u201cwith urgency\u201d. That 2023 buyback saw stock bought around the \u00a320 level. Price now: 868p. What a waste of shareholders\u2019 funds.</p> <p>The better news is that 868p was a 19% gain on the day because the new course, described on Thursday by Joshua Schulman, the new man from Coach, read as realistic after predecessor Jonathan Akeroyd\u2019s failed attempt to push the brand relentlessly upmarket. Akeroyd was searching for fatter profit margins but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/15/burberry-chief-executive-profit-warning-jonathan-akeroyd-joshua-schulman\">delivered profit warnings</a>.</p> <p>Schulman still offered the usual fashion industry blah-blah about \u201ccelebrating iconic brand codes\u201d, but he was really saying Burberry should remember its roots, which lie in trench coats and outerwear, and stop trying to go head-to-head on prices with the big French and Italian houses in products such as leather goods.</p> <p>Thus Burberry will still aim to flex its pricing muscle in coats, but the handbags will have to be cheaper than \u00a32,000 a pop \u2013 and the collections as a whole will be more timeless. \u201cOver the past several years, we moved too far from our core with disappointing results,\u201d said Schulman. \u201cOur brand expression was focused on being modern at the expense of celebrating our heritage.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s roughly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/15/burberry-new-ceo-customers-analysis#:~:text=Burberry%20has%20blessings%20that%20other,brand%20more%20than%20anything%20else.\">what the fashion critics have been saying for ages</a>.</p> <p>The relief for the City was that he\u2019s still thinking of Burberry as a \u201cluxury\u201d brand, as opposed to a mid-market label like Coach. That still implies, one assumes, an ambition to get roughly close to Burberry\u2019s wonder years under designer Christopher Bailey, and to hit profit margins in the upper teens percentage-wise.</p> <p>The bad news is that the turnaround probably won\u2019t be quick. Burberry has fallen a very long way. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/14/burberry-turnaround-chief-40m-cuts-scarf-bar-rollout-shares\">A half-year pre-tax loss of \u00a380m</a>, on revenues down by a fifth, is a spectacular comedown from a profit of \u00a3219m last year. At least Schulman has abandoned Akeroyd\u2019s dreamy visions of achieving annual revenues of \u00a35bn and is talking about \u00a33bn, which ought to be doable since that was the outcome two years ago.</p> <p>Fund manager Nick Train of Lindsell Train, a longstanding Burberry investor, <a href=\"https://www.finsburygt.com/application/files/3217/2561/0059/FGT_Factsheet_July_2024.pdf\">noted recently</a> that the group\u2019s shares had twice experienced peak-to-trough falls of 70%-plus this century. The last time was after the financial crisis of 2007-08, when people assumed luxury fashion would fall off a cliff. On that occasion, the rebound was a blast: from 160p at the bottom, the price was \u00a316 in 2011 along the way to \u00a326 at the top, 18 months ago.</p> <p>Maybe it was progress of that sort that persuaded Gerry Murphy, Burberry chair since 2018, to splurge some winnings on share buybacks at what turned out to be a terrible moment. Whatever the thought process, to go from \u00a3400m buybacks to no dividend in the space of 13 months is a shocker. Perhaps he\u2019ll explain all in next year\u2019s annual report \u2013 if he\u2019s still there.</p>",

Schulman still offered the usual fashion industry blah-blah about \u201ccelebrating iconic brand codes\u201d, but he was really saying Burberry should remember its roots, which lie in trench coats and outerwear, and stop trying to go head-to-head on prices with the big French and Italian houses in products such as leather goods. Thus Burberry will still aim to flex its pricing muscle in coats, but the handbags will have to be cheaper than \u00a32,000 a pop \u2013 and the collections as a whole will be more timeless. \u201cOver the past several years, we moved too far from our core with disappointing results,\u201d said Schulman. \u201cOur brand expression was focused on being modern at the expense of celebrating our heritage.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s roughly what the fashion critics have been saying for ages. The relief for the City was that he\u2019s still thinking of Burberry as a \u201cluxury\u201d brand, as opposed to a mid-market label like Coach. That still implies, one assumes, an ambition to get roughly close to Burberry\u2019s wonder years under designer Christopher Bailey, and to hit profit margins in the upper teens percentage-wise. The bad news is that the turnaround probably won\u2019t be quick. Burberry has fallen a very long way. A half-year pre-tax loss of \u00a380m, on revenues down by a fifth, is a spectacular comedown from a profit of \u00a3219m last year. At least Schulman has abandoned Akeroyd\u2019s dreamy visions of achieving annual revenues of \u00a35bn and is talking about \u00a33bn, which ought to be doable since that was the outcome two years ago. Fund manager Nick Train of Lindsell Train, a longstanding Burberry investor, noted recently that the group\u2019s shares had twice experienced peak-to-trough falls of 70%-plus this century. The last time was after the financial crisis of 2007-08, when people assumed luxury fashion would fall off a cliff. On that occasion, the rebound was a blast: from 160p at the bottom, the price was \u00a316 in 2011 along the way to \u00a326 at the top, 18 months ago. Maybe it was progress of that sort that persuaded Gerry Murphy, Burberry chair since 2018, to splurge some winnings on share buybacks at what turned out to be a terrible moment. Whatever the thought process, to go from \u00a3400m buybacks to no dividend in the space of 13 months is a shocker. Perhaps he\u2019ll explain all in next year\u2019s annual report \u2013 if he\u2019s still there.",

      "body": "<p>Oliver Hall writes that poor messaging was not an obvious cause of Kamala Harris\u2019s loss to Donald Trump (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/09/us-voters-kamala-harris-donald-trump-republican\">I spent hours trying to persuade US voters to choose Harris not Trump. I know why she lost, 9 November</a>). In fact, Democrat messaging is not bold enough. However, this is to be expected from a party that does not take bold action on the No 1 issue to voters: the economy.</p> <p>I come from a low-income Mexican American family and community in San Diego. Non-college-educated voters in my community are very unhappy with their economic situation under Joe Biden. Most of them do not follow the news and are not fully aware of things that Trump has said and done in the past. I have also heard voters repeat rightwing talking points that they have watched on YouTube. There is very little to counter this propaganda.</p> <p>Instead of reactively responding to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/08/trump-administration-project-2025\">Project 2025</a>, where is the Democrats\u2019<em> </em>own Project 2025? Instead of defensively claiming not to be a socialist, why not point out that Trump\u2019s popular Covid stimulus handouts <em>are </em>socialist and that we can offer <em>more</em> than that? It should not be news to Democrats that the phrase \u201cthere\u2019s nothing we can do\u201d is used in online mockeries of Democrat campaign slogans.</p> <p>As a college-educated voter, I did not vote for either candidate, because the left wing has repeatedly told the Democratic government to cancel student debt, support universal healthcare, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/24/election-harris-filibuster-abortion-roe\">eliminate the filibuster</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/may/21/supreme-court-expansion-democrats\">expand the court</a> etc. At every turn, Democrats insist on the status quo, which tells me that they will not respond to anything except the rudest of wake-up calls. I hope this is the one.<br><strong>Vanessa Torres<br></strong><em>San Diego, California, US</em></p> <p>\u2022 I appreciated many of Oliver Hall\u2019s points, though I did not agree with his conclusion. I agree that Donald Trump is a unique character, almost counterintuitively effective in garnering Americans\u2019 support.

      "bodyText": "Oliver Hall writes that poor messaging was not an obvious cause of Kamala Harris\u2019s loss to Donald Trump (I spent hours trying to persuade US voters to choose Harris not Trump. I know why she lost, 9 November). In fact, Democrat messaging is not bold enough. However, this is to be expected from a party that does not take bold action on the No 1 issue to voters: the economy. I come from a low-income Mexican American family and community in San Diego. Non-college-educated voters in my community are very unhappy with their economic situation under Joe Biden. Most of them do not follow the news and are not fully aware of things that Trump has said and done in the past. I have also heard voters repeat rightwing talking points that they have watched on YouTube. There is very little to counter this propaganda. Instead of reactively responding to Project 2025, where is the Democrats\u2019 own Project 2025? Instead of defensively claiming not to be a socialist, why not point out that Trump\u2019s popular Covid stimulus handouts are socialist and that we can offer more than that? It should not be news to Democrats that the phrase \u201cthere\u2019s nothing we can do\u201d is used in online mockeries of Democrat campaign slogans. As a college-educated voter, I did not vote for either candidate, because the left wing has repeatedly told the Democratic government to cancel student debt, support universal healthcare, eliminate the filibuster, expand the court etc. At every turn, Democrats insist on the status quo, which tells me that they will not respond to anything except the rudest of wake-up calls. I hope this is the one. Vanessa Torres San Diego, California, US \u2022 I appreciated many of Oliver Hall\u2019s points, though I did not agree with his conclusion. I agree that Donald Trump is a unique character, almost counterintuitively effective in garnering Americans\u2019 support. But Hall fails to identify what Michael Tomasky well describes in a recent op-ed in the New Republic.

Speaking at the glitzy annual gathering in the Square Mile on Thursday, the chancellor called the financial services sector the \u201ccrown jewel\u201d of the UK economy.

A 2023 flagship phone won\u2019t be much worse than a 2024 one and can save you a packet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/nov/14/black-friday-cyber-monday-how-to-get-best-deals-sales\">The best deals \u2013 or buyers\u2019 remorse? How to make sure you\u2019re not ripped off on Black Friday and Cyber Monday</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend buying last year\u2019s budget model, though. Its weaker specs will only get worse over time and it won\u2019t be supported with software updates for as long.\u201d Updates keep a device safe and install the latest features, so it\u2019s essential your phone can receive them.</p> <p>If you\u2019re keen on the AI features being pushed by manufacturers now, make sure your handset is powerful enough to run them. \u201cAI is memory-intensive so some older handsets may be left out in the cold,\u201d says Martin. \u201cThe forthcoming iPhone AI, Apple Intelligence, needs 8GB of RAM. That means the only compatible phones from last year\u2019s range are the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.\u201d</p> <h2>Mobile contracts</h2> <p>\u201cThe best Black Friday phone deals tend to be for SIM-free devices,\u201d says Andy Aitken of the mobile network Honest. \u201cWith contract deals, there are often strings attached, such as obligatory price hikes, and networks know people shop in a hurry on Black Friday without reading the small print. Also beware of seemingly amazing offers for more data than you need, such as 100GB when you need only 2GB.\u201d</p> <p>And watch out for enticingly cheap contracts that tie you in for years, says Alan Martin. \u201cI\u2019ve seen offers that headline the low monthly cost in the hope that people won\u2019t notice how long they\u2019re locked in for. As a rule of thumb, multiply the monthly cost by the number of months you\u2019re on the hook for. If that figure is significantly less than what you\u2019d pay for a SIM-free phone, it\u2019s a good deal \u2013 assuming the bundled data and minutes meet your needs.\u201d It\u2019s becoming increasingly standard to offer contracts for more than two years, so make sure to check before you sign up.</p> <p>Martin also cautions against being dazzled by Black Friday freebie bundles. \u201cI\u2019m still using my Bose QC25s that came with a Huawei phone six years ago, but it\u2019s worth looking up any freebies to find out if they\u2019re reviewed well. If you can\u2019t find any reviews, that\u2019s not a great sign.\u201d Always calculate the cost of the contract to find out how \u201cfree\u201d that freebie really is.</p>    <h2>Skincare</h2> <p>Premium serums, supplements and at-home facial tech can get very expensive outside the sales, so Black Friday may be the smartest time to stock up, says beauty expert Justine Masters, AKA the Alternative Facialist. But determine your skincare needs before you whip out your credit card. \u201cKnow your skin type,\u201d says Masters. \u201cThe deals can be fantastic and the products may be getting plenty of attention on TikTok, but if they\u2019re not right for your skin you\u2019ve wasted your money.\u201d Masters gives her social media followers a heads up on her own deals, so follow your favourite brands to get ahead of the queue.</p> <h2>Fashion</h2> <p>The leaves may still be clinging to the trees, but shops are already clearing out winter clothes. \u201cRetailers such as New Look and H&amp;M tend to offer seasonal discounts on winter essentials like coats, knitwear and accessories,\u201d says Andrew Norton, centre director of Eden Shopping Centre in High Wycombe. \u201cYou\u2019ll typically find the biggest reductions on out-of-season items and wardrobe basics like sweaters and jeans as shops clear stock, so it\u2019s a chance to buy high-quality pieces for less.\u201d</p> <p>Clothes get even cheaper in the January sales, says Norton, but be aware that it will be the stuff other people didn\u2019t want. \u201cFashion often sees deeper cuts after Christmas, particularly on winter clothing, so January can be a good option if you\u2019re looking for the lowest price. Black Friday is better for specific sizes or popular pieces because there\u2019s more stock available.\u201d</p>    <h2>Laptops and PCs</h2> <p>Black Friday 2023 saw heavy discounts on laptops, with models such as the <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-uk/shop/cty/pdp/spd/g-series-15-5530-laptop/cn22251\">Dell G15 gaming laptop</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-Galaxy-Processor-Storage-Graphite/dp/B0BSLMQFXJ\">Samsung Galaxy Book3 Ultra</a> shedding almost half their price before bouncing back up on the stroke of December. But they\u2019re still expensive, so shop carefully to avoid a false economy.</p> <p>\u201cA new PC or laptop has to come with Windows 11 pre-installed,\u201d says computing journalist Dominic Connor. \u201cAnd go long on memory. Look for at least 16GB of RAM if you\u2019re not technical enough to upgrade it later.\u201d Other features can be dispensed with to save money. \u201cReally cheap PCs may not have Bluetooth, but you can fix that with a \u00a310 dongle. And don\u2019t pay much more for the \u2018right\u2019 video port, because cheap adapters are available online.\u201d</p> <p>Refurbished PCs fall to well under \u00a3200 on Black Friday, but they bring their own challenges. \u201cRefurbished tech devices may not be able to run the latest software,\u201d warns Josh Long, chief security analyst at <a href=\"https://www.intego.com/\">Intego</a>. \u201cYou\u2019ll miss out on security updates and that can put you at risk. Make sure to check how many years of updates any device will get before buying.\u201d</p> <h2>TVs</h2> <p>As with phones, the best TV deals tend to be for old models \u2013 and Connor is fine with that. \u201cMy family and I have been buying \u2018last year\u2019s TV\u2019 since the 1980s. The trick is to buy last<em> year\u2019s</em>, not last <em>generation\u2019s</em>. Last year will be slightly less fancy; last generation won\u2019t be OLED and may be just bog standard LED.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s worth knowing the difference. Black Friday can be a chance for brands to off-load their low-quality TVs on unsuspecting bargain hunters. \u201cSomething I see in a lot of cheap TVs is if a single backlight LED fails, it takes out the entire TV,\u201d says tech journalist Andrew Spode. \u201cThis seems to be common in TVs that use cheaper parts and don\u2019t have great quality control. The other discount trick I\u2019ve seen is suspiciously large TVs going cheap, but they\u2019re only 30Hz so not suitable for gaming.\u201d A TV with a 30Hz refresh rate is fine for watching films on an average-sized screen, but on an enormous screen, it will look juddery.</p> <p>\u201cMany of the low to mid-range smart TVs in the sales have taken ideas from the \u2018fast fashion\u2019 playbook and only offer low-quality audio options,\u201d says digital rights expert Lauren Hendry Parsons of ExpressVPN. You could make up the audio slack by looking for Black Friday TV bundles with free soundbars. \u201cThese may not be the latest or most hi-tech models, but often they\u2019re perfectly serviceable and improve your viewing experience,\u201d says Hendry Parsons. \u201cIf a freebie tips the scales for an otherwise like-for-like deal, there\u2019s no reason to not consider it.\u201d</p> <p>Spotting a good deal is easier if you\u2019ve done your research. Samsung\u2019s Jeremy Demont recommends reading reviews and knowing what you want to buy before Black Friday. \u201cKnow what TV model, size and image quality you\u2019re looking for, so you can recognise a genuinely good deal. Also look for added value such as free delivery, finance options and discounted compatible components.\u201d</p>    <h2>Toys and games</h2> <p>\u201cToys like Lego sets tend to have good price drops for all the \u2018shopping holidays\u2019 like Prime Day and Black Friday,\u201d says Daniel Green, founder of Amazon price-tracker <a href=\"https://uk.camelcamelcamel.com/\">CamelCamelCamel</a>. \u201cPrices at Amazon are changing all the time, so it\u2019s wise to track them to ensure you aren\u2019t buying when they are high. This becomes much more important during peak shopping season.\u201d </p> <p>Different types of toys are better buys on Black Friday and in the January sales, says Eden Shopping Centre\u2019s Andrew Norton. \u201cTrending items or those with high restocking rates tend to get the best discounts around now, and we see big savings on larger items retailers want to move before Christmas. January sales may offer further discounts on classic toys or less time-sensitive items.\u201d</p> <h2>Washing machines and dishwashers</h2> <p>Appliances aren\u2019t traditional Black Friday superstars, instead reaching their lowest prices in summer. There will be bargains around, says Fergus Johnston of Hotpoint, but shop carefully and make energy efficiency a priority. \u201cAlways check the energy label. Higher-rated appliances may cost more upfront but they use less energy and can make a significant difference to your household running costs. Also, look for a retailer with a wide supply of spare parts and good warranty terms.\u201d</p> <p>Sustainability still matters in the sales, says Johnston. \u201cThe environmental impact of Black Friday has become a talking point in recent years. It\u2019s important to choose a business that holds up its responsibilities.\u201d </p>    <h2>Air fryers and coffee machines</h2> <p>These twin titans of the 21st-century kitchen are huge sellers in the run-up to Christmas, so you might not expect them to be discounted. Isabella Forgione, small appliances expert at <a href=\"http://ao.com\">AO.com</a>, has news for you. \u201cThese items are perfect for gifting, so we see a greater demand at this time of year and they have some of our biggest discounts.\u201d Indeed, Black Friday 2023 saw bestsellers, including the <a href=\"https://www.towerhousewares.co.uk/products/tower-xpress-air-fryers\">Tower Xpress air fryer</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nespresso-Machine-Barista-2xNespresso-2xSpoons/dp/B0D1KSJQVZ/\">Nespresso Barista coffee machine</a> reach historically low prices with various retailers.</p> <h2>Furniture</h2> <p>As eager as you may be to replace the wobbly dining table or saggy guest mattress before the masses descend at Christmas, don\u2019t expect to make big Black Friday savings. \u201cRetailers reserve their biggest furniture discounts for the new year to make way for new products,\u201d says Nick Drewe of discount platform Wethrift. \u201cHome fitness equipment also tends to be cheaper in January, because retailers and gyms run promotions to capitalise on post-Christmas goals.\u201d</p> <p>Home office furniture is a different story. Many of Amazon\u2019s bestselling office chairs and desks dip to their lowest prices in Black Friday week. However, Mike Moore of TechRadar Pro cautions against being swayed by heavy discounts. \u201cAn office chair is something you\u2019re going to be using for long stretches of time.\u201d Buying online also means you can\u2019t try out the chair. \u201cYou should be able to have both feet on the floor and your elbows at a 90- to 110-degree angle. At least do some measuring before you shop.\u201d</p> <h2>Travel and luggage</h2>    <p>Holiday packages, hotels and flights see price drops on Black Friday, but you\u2019ll need to keep an open mind about timings. \u201cThe best deals tend to be for midweek bookings and on packages that would normally be among the cheapest anyway,\u201d says Carolyn Pearson, founder of women\u2019s business travel network Maiden Voyage. \u201cWeekends and school holidays are always in demand so they\u2019re rarely discounted, even on Black Friday.\u201d</p> <p>Packing essentials offer richer pickings, says Pearson. \u201cI get all my summer wellness essentials in the Black Friday sales. I stock up on pillow sprays, eye masks and magnesium supplements, which all really help me sleep when I\u2019m away. <a href=\"https://www.lookfantastic.com/c/black-friday/waitlist/\">Lookfantastic</a>\u2019s Waitlist newsletter is good for discount codes and early deals.\u201d</p>",

A 2023 flagship phone won\u2019t be much worse than a 2024 one and can save you a packet. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend buying last year\u2019s budget model, though. Its weaker specs will only get worse over time and it won\u2019t be supported with software updates for as long.\u201d Updates keep a device safe and install the latest features, so it\u2019s essential your phone can receive them. If you\u2019re keen on the AI features being pushed by manufacturers now, make sure your handset is powerful enough to run them. \u201cAI is memory-intensive so some older handsets may be left out in the cold,\u201d says Martin. \u201cThe forthcoming iPhone AI, Apple Intelligence, needs 8GB of RAM. That means the only compatible phones from last year\u2019s range are the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.\u201d Mobile contracts \u201cThe best Black Friday phone deals tend to be for SIM-free devices,\u201d says Andy Aitken of the mobile network Honest. \u201cWith contract deals, there are often strings attached, such as obligatory price hikes, and networks know people shop in a hurry on Black Friday without reading the small print. Also beware of seemingly amazing offers for more data than you need, such as 100GB when you need only 2GB.\u201d And watch out for enticingly cheap contracts that tie you in for years, says Alan Martin. \u201cI\u2019ve seen offers that headline the low monthly cost in the hope that people won\u2019t notice how long they\u2019re locked in for. As a rule of thumb, multiply the monthly cost by the number of months you\u2019re on the hook for. If that figure is significantly less than what you\u2019d pay for a SIM-free phone, it\u2019s a good deal \u2013 assuming the bundled data and minutes meet your needs.\u201d It\u2019s becoming increasingly standard to offer contracts for more than two years, so make sure to check before you sign up. Martin also cautions against being dazzled by Black Friday freebie bundles. \u201cI\u2019m still using my Bose QC25s that came with a Huawei phone six years ago, but it\u2019s worth looking up any freebies to find out if they\u2019re reviewed well. If you can\u2019t find any reviews, that\u2019s not a great sign.\u201d Always calculate the cost of the contract to find out how \u201cfree\u201d that freebie really is. Skincare Premium serums, supplements and at-home facial tech can get very expensive outside the sales, so Black Friday may be the smartest time to stock up, says beauty expert Justine Masters, AKA the Alternative Facialist. But determine your skincare needs before you whip out your credit card. \u201cKnow your skin type,\u201d says Masters. \u201cThe deals can be fantastic and the products may be getting plenty of attention on TikTok, but if they\u2019re not right for your skin you\u2019ve wasted your money.\u201d Masters gives her social media followers a heads up on her own deals, so follow your favourite brands to get ahead of the queue. Fashion The leaves may still be clinging to the trees, but shops are already clearing out winter clothes. \u201cRetailers such as New Look and H&amp;M tend to offer seasonal discounts on winter essentials like coats, knitwear and accessories,\u201d says Andrew Norton, centre director of Eden Shopping Centre in High Wycombe. \u201cYou\u2019ll typically find the biggest reductions on out-of-season items and wardrobe basics like sweaters and jeans as shops clear stock, so it\u2019s a chance to buy high-quality pieces for less.\u201d Clothes get even cheaper in the January sales, says Norton, but be aware that it will be the stuff other people didn\u2019t want. \u201cFashion often sees deeper cuts after Christmas, particularly on winter clothing, so January can be a good option if you\u2019re looking for the lowest price. Black Friday is better for specific sizes or popular pieces because there\u2019s more stock available.\u201d Laptops and PCs Black Friday 2023 saw heavy discounts on laptops, with models such as the Dell G15 gaming laptop and the Samsung Galaxy Book3 Ultra shedding almost half their price before bouncing back up on the stroke of December. But they\u2019re still expensive, so shop carefully to avoid a false economy. \u201cA new PC or laptop has to come with Windows 11 pre-installed,\u201d says computing journalist Dominic Connor. \u201cAnd go long on memory. Look for at least 16GB of RAM if you\u2019re not technical enough to upgrade it later.\u201d Other features can be dispensed with to save money. \u201cReally cheap PCs may not have Bluetooth, but you can fix that with a \u00a310 dongle. And don\u2019t pay much more for the \u2018right\u2019 video port, because cheap adapters are available online.\u201d Refurbished PCs fall to well under \u00a3200 on Black Friday, but they bring their own challenges. \u201cRefurbished tech devices may not be able to run the latest software,\u201d warns Josh Long, chief security analyst at Intego. \u201cYou\u2019ll miss out on security updates and that can put you at risk. Make sure to check how many years of updates any device will get before buying.\u201d TVs As with phones, the best TV deals tend to be for old models \u2013 and Connor is fine with that. \u201cMy family and I have been buying \u2018last year\u2019s TV\u2019 since the 1980s. The trick is to buy last year\u2019s, not last generation\u2019s. Last year will be slightly less fancy; last generation won\u2019t be OLED and may be just bog standard LED.\u201d It\u2019s worth knowing the difference. Black Friday can be a chance for brands to off-load their low-quality TVs on unsuspecting bargain hunters. \u201cSomething I see in a lot of cheap TVs is if a single backlight LED fails, it takes out the entire TV,\u201d says tech journalist Andrew Spode. \u201cThis seems to be common in TVs that use cheaper parts and don\u2019t have great quality control. The other discount trick I\u2019ve seen is suspiciously large TVs going cheap, but they\u2019re only 30Hz so not suitable for gaming.\u201d A TV with a 30Hz refresh rate is fine for watching films on an average-sized screen, but on an enormous screen, it will look juddery. \u201cMany of the low to mid-range smart TVs in the sales have taken ideas from the \u2018fast fashion\u2019 playbook and only offer low-quality audio options,\u201d says digital rights expert Lauren Hendry Parsons of ExpressVPN. You could make up the audio slack by looking for Black Friday TV bundles with free soundbars. \u201cThese may not be the latest or most hi-tech models, but often they\u2019re perfectly serviceable and improve your viewing experience,\u201d says Hendry Parsons. \u201cIf a freebie tips the scales for an otherwise like-for-like deal, there\u2019s no reason to not consider it.\u201d Spotting a good deal is easier if you\u2019ve done your research. Samsung\u2019s Jeremy Demont recommends reading reviews and knowing what you want to buy before Black Friday. \u201cKnow what TV model, size and image quality you\u2019re looking for, so you can recognise a genuinely good deal. Also look for added value such as free delivery, finance options and discounted compatible components.\u201d Toys and games \u201cToys like Lego sets tend to have good price drops for all the \u2018shopping holidays\u2019 like Prime Day and Black Friday,\u201d says Daniel Green, founder of Amazon price-tracker CamelCamelCamel. \u201cPrices at Amazon are changing all the time, so it\u2019s wise to track them to ensure you aren\u2019t buying when they are high. This becomes much more important during peak shopping season.\u201d Different types of toys are better buys on Black Friday and in the January sales, says Eden Shopping Centre\u2019s Andrew Norton. \u201cTrending items or those with high restocking rates tend to get the best discounts around now, and we see big savings on larger items retailers want to move before Christmas. January sales may offer further discounts on classic toys or less time-sensitive items.\u201d Washing machines and dishwashers Appliances aren\u2019t traditional Black Friday superstars, instead reaching their lowest prices in summer. There will be bargains around, says Fergus Johnston of Hotpoint, but shop carefully and make energy efficiency a priority. \u201cAlways check the energy label. Higher-rated appliances may cost more upfront but they use less energy and can make a significant difference to your household running costs. Also, look for a retailer with a wide supply of spare parts and good warranty terms.\u201d Sustainability still matters in the sales, says Johnston. \u201cThe environmental impact of Black Friday has become a talking point in recent years. It\u2019s important to choose a business that holds up its responsibilities.\u201d Air fryers and coffee machines These twin titans of the 21st-century kitchen are huge sellers in the run-up to Christmas, so you might not expect them to be discounted. Isabella Forgione, small appliances expert at AO.com, has news for you. \u201cThese items are perfect for gifting, so we see a greater demand at this time of year and they have some of our biggest discounts.\u201d Indeed, Black Friday 2023 saw bestsellers, including the Tower Xpress air fryer and the Nespresso Barista coffee machine reach historically low prices with various retailers. Furniture As eager as you may be to replace the wobbly dining table or saggy guest mattress before the masses descend at Christmas, don\u2019t expect to make big Black Friday savings. \u201cRetailers reserve their biggest furniture discounts for the new year to make way for new products,\u201d says Nick Drewe of discount platform Wethrift. \u201cHome fitness equipment also tends to be cheaper in January, because retailers and gyms run promotions to capitalise on post-Christmas goals.\u201d Home office furniture is a different story. Many of Amazon\u2019s bestselling office chairs and desks dip to their lowest prices in Black Friday week. However, Mike Moore of TechRadar Pro cautions against being swayed by heavy discounts. \u201cAn office chair is something you\u2019re going to be using for long stretches of time.\u201d Buying online also means you can\u2019t try out the chair. \u201cYou should be able to have both feet on the floor and your elbows at a 90- to 110-degree angle. At least do some measuring before you shop.\u201d Travel and luggage Holiday packages, hotels and flights see price drops on Black Friday, but you\u2019ll need to keep an open mind about timings. \u201cThe best deals tend to be for midweek bookings and on packages that would normally be among the cheapest anyway,\u201d says Carolyn Pearson, founder of women\u2019s business travel network Maiden Voyage. \u201cWeekends and school holidays are always in demand so they\u2019re rarely discounted, even on Black Friday.\u201d Packing essentials offer richer pickings, says Pearson. \u201cI get all my summer wellness essentials in the Black Friday sales. I stock up on pillow sprays, eye masks and magnesium supplements, which all really help me sleep when I\u2019m away. Lookfantastic\u2019s Waitlist newsletter is good for discount codes and early deals.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A firm run by the major Conservative donor Anthony Bamford has funded a \u00a38,000 helicopter trip for the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage. Lord Bamford, who sat as a Conservative peer until his retirement from the House of Lords this year, has given millions of pounds to the Tories and been a close ally of Boris Johnson \u2013 funding the former prime minister\u2019s accommodation after he left office. But JC Bamford Excavators paid for a helicopter trip for Farage and one of his staff members on 25 October, valued at \u00a38,413.20.

However, the fact that Farage has been courted by the business of a major Conservative donor has raised eyebrows among Tories, who are nervous about the prospect of the Reform leader building relationships with their donors. A spokesperson for Farage said: \u201cNigel and Lord Bamford are friends.\u201d Several Conservative donors have made the leap to Reform in recent years, including the financier Jeremy Hosking, and Charlie Mullins, who previously donated to the Tories through his business Pimlico Plumbers.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said about 30 targets had been struck in the southern suburbs of Beirut in 48 hours and described continuing efforts to \u201cdismantle and degrade\u201d the military capabilities of the militant Islamist organisation. Analysts said the wave of raids could also be aimed at increasing pressure on Hezbollah as indirect talks continued. Eli Cohen, Israel\u2019s energy minister, told Reuters an arrangement to end fighting with Hezbollah was drawing closer but insisted that Israel must retain freedom to act inside Lebanon should any deal be violated. \u201cWe will be less forgiving than in the past over attempts to create strongholds in territory near Israel. That\u2019s how we will be, and so that is certainly how we will act,\u201d he said. A senior Lebanese official indicated on Wednesday that Hezbollah was ready to pull its forces away from the Lebanese-Israeli border in any ceasefire but rejected Israel\u2019s demand to be allowed to intervene at will to enforce a deal. Tens of thousands of Israelis with homes along the contested border are still displaced by the threat of Hezbollah attacks, and the costs of the war in Lebanon for Israel are mounting. Six Israeli soldiers were killed in combat with Hezbollah on Wednesday. According to Lebanon\u2019s health ministry, Israeli attacks have killed at least 3,365 people and wounded 14,344 across Lebanon since 7 October last year. Hezbollah attacks have killed about 100 civilians and Israeli troops in northern Israel, the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and southern Lebanon over the past year, according to Israel. Israel has been carrying out strikes against Iran-linked targets in Syria for years but has increased such raids since the October attack by Hamas that killed 1,200, mostly civilians, and triggered the Gaza war. Thursday\u2019s strike targeted two residential buildings in suburbs of the Syrian capital, Damascus, on Thursday and killed more than a dozen people, the Syrian state news agency SANA said. One building was in the suburb of Mazzeh, and the other in Qudsaya, west of the capital. Commanders in Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah armed group, and Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards based in Syria, have been known to live in Mazzeh, according to residents, and the authorities have used the area\u2019s high-rise blocks in the past to house leaders of Palestinian factions, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad. In Gaza, fighting has continued in Jabaliya, in the north, where Israeli forces are clashing with Hamas militants and four Israeli soldiers were killed earlier this week. Israel says the siege it has imposed on Jabaliya allows for necessary operations against militants who have regrouped there, but many Palestinians fear the offensive is aimed at permanently displacing tens or even hundreds of thousands of civilians from their homes. \u201cThey have torched schools and other shelters where people took refuge before ordering families to head south toward Gaza City. What do you call that, if not ethnic cleansing?\u201d asked Said Abdel-Hadi, a resident from Beit Lahiya, now displaced in Gaza City. \u201cMany families who at the beginning were against leaving were forced to do so after they ran out of water and food. Large areas have become empty, under the control of the occupation. Those areas have become off-limits.\u201d Dr Hossam Abu Safia, Kamal Adwan hospital director in Beit Lahiya, in the north of Gaza, said medical supplies were running out, there was not enough food for patients, and there were no working ambulances. \u201cEvery hour, we lose patients due to these severe conditions,\u201d Abu Safia said. Israeli airstrikes have intensified in recent days across the whole of Gaza, with more than 40 people killed on Monday alone.

The Tophub caf\u00e9 opened two weeks ago in a makeshift shelter of corrugated iron.

I lost my best companion,\u201d said Jihad Badriya, 20. The IDF said it was not aware of any Israeli attack on Monday at the location of the cafe. Palestinian health ministry officials on Thursday said Israel\u2019s latest strikes killed at least 15 people across Gaza, including four at Gaza City\u2019s Salahudeen school, which shelters displaced families. There was no immediate Israeli comment. More than 43,500 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the Israeli offensive there, with 2 million people displaced and much of the strip reduced to rubble.

Several international artists and Icelandic organisations urged Samherji to drop the case, warning it would have a chilling effect on artists engaging critically with corporate power. In a judgment released on Thursday, the judge Paul Teverson sided with the fishing company, concluding that Odee\u2019s artwork was an \u201cinstrument of fraud, copyright infringement and malicious falsehood\u201d. He said that because Samherji\u2019s logo and corporate design had not been altered in any significant way, defending the work as a caricature, parody or pastiche would be unlikely to succeed in a full trial. \u201cParody must evoke an existing work but be noticeably different from the original and constitute an expression of humour or mockery,\u201d Teverson said. \u201cPastiche imitates the style of an existing work whilst being noticeably different from the original.\u201d The high court further said the artist would probably fail to defend himself in court from the legal wrong of \u201cpassing off\u201d, when someone misrepresents their goods or services as those of another party.

The scandal had a devastating effect on locally employed fishers.

The Tories use the report to attack Labour, for dropping some of their policies, and Reform UK use it to attack the last Conservative government, for allowing immigration to risen massively.</p> <p>The OECD itself, which acts as a thinktank for its 38 member countries, has a very different take; it says the UK is far from alone in having record immigration, and it says internationally \u201cmigration is at record levels but not beyond control\u201d.</p> <p>Referring to the situation for all OECD countries, it says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Up by 10% compared to 2022, permanent-type migration to OECD countries set a new record in 2023 with 6.5 million new permanent immigrants, 28% above 2019 levels. Most of the 2023 increase was driven by family migration (including family accompanying workers), but humanitarian migration was also on the rise. By contrast, labour migration within free mobility areas was stable in 2023.</p> <p>About a third of OECD countries experienced record immigration levels in 2023, including Canada, France, Japan, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Another third recorded a drop in inflows, including Denmark, Estonia, Israel, Italy, Lithuania and New Zealand.</p> </blockquote> <p>The report says that in the UK permanent-type migration has risen since 2015 at a much higher rate than in most other OECD countries.</p>    <p>But it also says that, when permanent-type migration is considered as a proportion of the total population, the UK is much closer to the OECD average.</p>    <p>In his introduction to the report, <strong>Stefano Scarpetta</strong>, the OECD\u2019s director for employment, labour and social affairs, said high levels of migration create \u201cwidespread concern\u201d. But he says the problems can be managed, and migration also creates opportunities.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These high flows have fuelled widespread concern about migrants\u2019 impact on receiving countries\u2019 economies and societies, putting migration management and border control at the top of political agendas and the centre of voters\u2019 interests in 2024 elections. Reflecting structural trends rather than temporary blips, these increasing migration flows raise legitimate concern, but they also point to major opportunities. Evidence from OECD countries suggests that these high flows can be well managed with appropriate policy.</p> </blockquote> <p>But that is not the line picked up by the Tories and Reform UK in their comments on the report.</p> <p>For the Conservatives, <strong>Chris Philp</strong>, the shadow home secretary, highlighted the fact that the report confirms changes to visa policies announced by the last government will reduce net migration. \u201cLabour now places all of that at risk with an ideologically driven push to can that legacy, which would open the doors to migration and undo all the progress we made,\u201d he said.</p> <p>For Reform UK, <strong>Richard Tice</strong>, the deputy leader, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For 14 years the Tories promised us action on immigration and instead all we were left with was the highest numbers on record. </p> <p>This latest report is a damning indictment of fourteen years of Tory rule. Mass immigration has made us all poorer and has damaged social cohesion.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-67361bdb8f08ddbfa7cdf215\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/libbybrooks\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-14T16:18:34.156Z\">4.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Scotland's health secretary Neil Gray apologises for acting 'more as fan than minister' in taking official cars to matches</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Scotland\u2019s health secretary \u2013 and Dons fan \u2013 <strong>Neil Gray</strong> has apologised for appearing to act \u201cmore as a fan than a minister\u201d when he took ministerial cars to Aberdeen games on three occasions in six months.</p> <p>In response to mounting criticism from opposition parties at Holyrood, and on the day that his planned reforms to social care were delayed yet again, Gray told MSPs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I have reflected upon and what I apologise for is the appearance that I have been acting more as a fan, not getting the balance right, by attending Aberdeen games and attending others.</p> </blockquote> <p>But he insisted that he had not broken any rules and that all the matches were recorded as official government business, with summaries of the discussions that took place to be published. </p> <p>He revealed that he\u2019d attended a total of six matches accompanied by family members and guests in the chauffeur-driven limousines, the three Aberdeen ones mentioned in a report at the weekend, but also other matches including a Scotland game.</p> <p>With the Scottish Conservatives demanding further investigation, this will be a real test of John Swinney\u2019s commitment in Programme for Government <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/news/scottish-ministerial-code-to-be-strengthened/\">to strengthen the ministerial code</a>, and to let independent advisers decide unilaterally whether something is worth investigating as a breach. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6736173a8f08f1bf90e50fbc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-14T15:38:17.572Z\">3.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Former Labour minister Margaret Hodge says it's 'bit daft' for Streeting to suggest assisted dying law would cost NHS</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Margaret Hodge</strong>, the former Labour minister who now sits in the House of Lords, has criticised Wes Streeting, the health secretary, for speaking out too much against the assisted dying bill.</p> <p>Echoing the line taken by Kim Leadbeater (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/14/uk-politics-live-labour-conservatives-met-police?page=with:block-6735e7948f08ac207a0fe5c6#block-6735e7948f08ac207a0fe5c6\">12.32pm</a>), Hodge told the BBC\u2019s Politics Live:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m a great Wes Streeting fan but I think on this issue he should do what the cabinet secretary said and just hold fire a little bit.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hodge, who was chair of the Commons public accounts committee for five years, also said she thought it was \u201ca bit daft\u201d for Streeting to suggest that an assisted dying law would put<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/13/assisted-dying-law-nhs-cuts-wes-streeting\"> a significant financial burden on the NHS.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you look at the NHS budget, most of it goes on the last six months of life \u2026 to argue that this is going to cost extra sounds to me a bit daft.</p> </blockquote>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-14T15:38:54.890Z\">at 3.38pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-673614828f08f1bf90e50f8f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-14T15:19:24.241Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>Home Office</strong> has issued a statement responding to the claim made by Sir Mark Rowley, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, about his force facing \u201ceye-watering cuts\u201d.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think the decision of the Tory governments after me to freeze tuition fees was pretty stupid because it starved the sector of money. </p> <p>But it is a very unusual decision, isn\u2019t it, from a Labour education secretary, because for much of the period in opposition, Labour was saying, \u2018We\u2019re actually going to get rid of these tuition fees\u2019 even though they were originally introduced by Tony Blair\u2019s government \u2026</p> <p>I think it\u2019s good what Bridget Phillipson has done. </p> <p>Is this now the death of this romantic idea that various oppositions have flirted with, first the Conservatives, before 2010, then the Labour oppositions under the Tories, that somehow we\u2019re going to get rid of this tuition fee regime?</p> </blockquote> <p>Osborne joked:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I mean, a cut in the winter fuel payment, an increase in tuition fees.

But the procedure is different for private members\u2019 bills.</p> <p>Powell said the committee would reflect a fair balance taking into account views on the bill. She explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Should the house agree to second reading after a debate for the [assisted dying bill] at the end of November, it would then be for the sponsoring member to choose the members of that committee.</p> <p>The guidance that surrounds this is absolutely clear about nominating members.

      "bodyText": "Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has been criticised by Labour colleagues for his comments yesterday suggesting the assisted dying bill would create a cost for the NHS. The Labour MP promoting the bill, Kim Leadbeater, and Margaret Hodge, a former Labour minister, have both suggested he has breached the rule saying ministers are meant to be neutral on this issue and should not be trying to sway the public debate. (See 12.32pm and 3.38pm.) More than 250 unpaid carers risk criminal prosecution after falling foul of draconian benefit rules in the past six months, official figures reveal. Income fell on almost all farm types in England last year, as extreme weather hit yields and the government cut subsidies. The UK government has promised to introduce tougher enforcement action against airlines that fail to protect customers from losses caused by flight disruption after an inquiry into last August\u2019s air traffic meltdown, which led to more than 700,000 people facing delays and cancellations. MPs have supported extending measures designed to increase representation of women bishops in the House of Lords, PA Media reports. The Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015 (extension) bill continues for a further five years the policy of filling any vacancies that appear on the bishop\u2019s benches in the unelected house with female bishops. It received an unopposed second reading in the Commons this afternoon and will undergo further scrutiny at a later date. Six Labour MPs have been appointed parliamentary private secretaries. As ministerial aides, they don\u2019t get a salary, but they are deemed part of the \u201cpayroll vote\u201d and being a PPS is normally the first step to becoming a minister. They are: Matthew Patrick \u2013 Department for Culture, Media and Sport / Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology Josh Simons\u2013 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Lucy Rigby \u2013 Ministry of Justice Gordon McKee \u2013 Department for Work and Pensions Claire Hughes \u2013 Department for Business and Trade Julie Minns \u2013 Department for Transport The Conservative party and Reform UK have both issued statements triggered by the findings in a 384-page report out today from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) about migration trends in 2023. The Tories use the report to attack Labour, for dropping some of their policies, and Reform UK use it to attack the last Conservative government, for allowing immigration to risen massively. The OECD itself, which acts as a thinktank for its 38 member countries, has a very different take; it says the UK is far from alone in having record immigration, and it says internationally \u201cmigration is at record levels but not beyond control\u201d. Referring to the situation for all OECD countries, it says: Up by 10% compared to 2022, permanent-type migration to OECD countries set a new record in 2023 with 6.5 million new permanent immigrants, 28% above 2019 levels. Most of the 2023 increase was driven by family migration (including family accompanying workers), but humanitarian migration was also on the rise. By contrast, labour migration within free mobility areas was stable in 2023. About a third of OECD countries experienced record immigration levels in 2023, including Canada, France, Japan, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Another third recorded a drop in inflows, including Denmark, Estonia, Israel, Italy, Lithuania and New Zealand. The report says that in the UK permanent-type migration has risen since 2015 at a much higher rate than in most other OECD countries. But it also says that, when permanent-type migration is considered as a proportion of the total population, the UK is much closer to the OECD average. In his introduction to the report, Stefano Scarpetta, the OECD\u2019s director for employment, labour and social affairs, said high levels of migration create \u201cwidespread concern\u201d. But he says the problems can be managed, and migration also creates opportunities. These high flows have fuelled widespread concern about migrants\u2019 impact on receiving countries\u2019 economies and societies, putting migration management and border control at the top of political agendas and the centre of voters\u2019 interests in 2024 elections. Reflecting structural trends rather than temporary blips, these increasing migration flows raise legitimate concern, but they also point to major opportunities. Evidence from OECD countries suggests that these high flows can be well managed with appropriate policy. But that is not the line picked up by the Tories and Reform UK in their comments on the report. For the Conservatives, Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, highlighted the fact that the report confirms changes to visa policies announced by the last government will reduce net migration. \u201cLabour now places all of that at risk with an ideologically driven push to can that legacy, which would open the doors to migration and undo all the progress we made,\u201d he said. For Reform UK, Richard Tice, the deputy leader, said: For 14 years the Tories promised us action on immigration and instead all we were left with was the highest numbers on record. This latest report is a damning indictment of fourteen years of Tory rule. Mass immigration has made us all poorer and has damaged social cohesion. Scotland\u2019s health secretary \u2013 and Dons fan \u2013 Neil Gray has apologised for appearing to act \u201cmore as a fan than a minister\u201d when he took ministerial cars to Aberdeen games on three occasions in six months. In response to mounting criticism from opposition parties at Holyrood, and on the day that his planned reforms to social care were delayed yet again, Gray told MSPs: What I have reflected upon and what I apologise for is the appearance that I have been acting more as a fan, not getting the balance right, by attending Aberdeen games and attending others. But he insisted that he had not broken any rules and that all the matches were recorded as official government business, with summaries of the discussions that took place to be published. He revealed that he\u2019d attended a total of six matches accompanied by family members and guests in the chauffeur-driven limousines, the three Aberdeen ones mentioned in a report at the weekend, but also other matches including a Scotland game. With the Scottish Conservatives demanding further investigation, this will be a real test of John Swinney\u2019s commitment in Programme for Government to strengthen the ministerial code, and to let independent advisers decide unilaterally whether something is worth investigating as a breach. Margaret Hodge, the former Labour minister who now sits in the House of Lords, has criticised Wes Streeting, the health secretary, for speaking out too much against the assisted dying bill. Echoing the line taken by Kim Leadbeater (see 12.32pm), Hodge told the BBC\u2019s Politics Live: I\u2019m a great Wes Streeting fan but I think on this issue he should do what the cabinet secretary said and just hold fire a little bit. Hodge, who was chair of the Commons public accounts committee for five years, also said she thought it was \u201ca bit daft\u201d for Streeting to suggest that an assisted dying law would put a significant financial burden on the NHS. If you look at the NHS budget, most of it goes on the last six months of life \u2026 to argue that this is going to cost extra sounds to me a bit daft. The Home Office has issued a statement responding to the claim made by Sir Mark Rowley, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, about his force facing \u201ceye-watering cuts\u201d. (See 9.22am.) A spokesperson said: The budget delivers real increases in funding for policing. The Metropolitan police will receive up to \u00a33.5bn in funding in 2024-25. This is in addition to \u00a337.4m provided for the 2024-25 pay award which has been allocated outside of the police funding settlement. George Osborne, the former Conservative chancellor, has praised the Labour government for raising university tuition fees. Speaking on his Political Currency podcast, which he co-hosts with Ed Balls, Osborne said that the last Conservative government was wrong to freeze them. And he said he hoped this meant Labour had now abandoned all hope of wanting to get rid of them. He said: I think the decision of the Tory governments after me to freeze tuition fees was pretty stupid because it starved the sector of money. But it is a very unusual decision, isn\u2019t it, from a Labour education secretary, because for much of the period in opposition, Labour was saying, \u2018We\u2019re actually going to get rid of these tuition fees\u2019 even though they were originally introduced by Tony Blair\u2019s government \u2026 I think it\u2019s good what Bridget Phillipson has done. Is this now the death of this romantic idea that various oppositions have flirted with, first the Conservatives, before 2010, then the Labour oppositions under the Tories, that somehow we\u2019re going to get rid of this tuition fee regime? Osborne joked: I mean, a cut in the winter fuel payment, an increase in tuition fees. I\u2019m beginning to like this government quite a lot. If the assisted dying bill passed at second reading, a public bill committee will be set up to consider the bill line by line before it returns to the floor of the Commons for its report stage and third reading votes. During business questions Lucy Powell, the leader of the Commons, was asked for an assurance that the public bill committee would reflect the balance of opinion in the Commons as a whole, for an against the bill. For government bills, these committees just have to reflect the party balance in the Commons as a whole, because MPs vote along party lines. But the procedure is different for private members\u2019 bills. Powell said the committee would reflect a fair balance taking into account views on the bill. She explained: Should the house agree to second reading after a debate for the [assisted dying bill] at the end of November, it would then be for the sponsoring member to choose the members of that committee. The guidance that surrounds this is absolutely clear about nominating members. They must reflect the party balance in the house and reflect a balance of views as outlined in the bill at second reading as well. And I know that the member for Spen Valley [Kim Leadbeater] is very, very keen indeed to follow this guidance and ensure that there is a balanced committee. UPDATE: This post originally said public bill committees normally just reflect party balance. That is the case for government bills. But for private members\u2019 bills the rules are different (as the Powell quote says) and committee membership must reflect the balance of views in the Commons too. I have changed the wording to clarify this. At PMQs yesterday Keir Starmer declined an invitation to promise that extra time would be made available for MPs to debate the assisted dying bill so that all its provisions can be properly scrutinised. But during business questions in the Commons today Lucy Powell, the leader of the Commons, implied that plenty of time would be available anyway without two more days being allocated for the debate, as the Tory Alec Shelbrooke suggested in his question to Starmer. Powell said: As it\u2019ll be the first item of business on November 29, it is highly likely that the second reading debate will last for the full five hours. This is comparable or longer to any other bill, perhaps longer. Should the house agree to second reading it would then be considered in committee for likely several weeks. The whole house will then also have further opportunities to debate and vote on these matters both at report stage and again at third reading, which won\u2019t be until April at the earliest. Powell also said that, if the bill did get a second reading, the government would work with Kim Leadbeater, the MP who has tabled it, to ensure it was \u201cworkable\u201d. She said: The government has a duty to make sure that any bill that passes through parliament is effective and can be enforced. At the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson rejected suggestions that Wes Streeting, the health secretary, is ignoring the instruction that ministers should not try to influence the public debate on the assisted dying bill. (See 12.32pm.) Asked if Keir Starmer was confident that ministers were respecting the guidance from the cabinet secretary on this matter, the spokesperson replied: Yes. Ultimately, this is a case where the PM has said it is a free vote for MPs. Government will respect the will of parliament. Cabinet ministers have made very clear that the whole of government will respect the will of parliament on this deeply emotive issue. Asked specifically about the intevention yesterday from Streeting, which led to Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP who has tabled the bill, suggesting he was ignoring the advice for ministers, the spokesperson said: I point you back to what the health secretary himself has said, which is that his department, the whole of government, will respect the will of parliament on this issue. Asked about claims that, by implying that an assisted dying law would take money from other parts of the NHS Streeting was intervening in the debate, the spokesperson said it was \u201ccommon practice for government to examine implications of possible legislative proposals, including private members\u2019 bills\u201d. The spokesperson also declined to say whether Starmer himself would or would not definitely vote in the debate a fortnight tomorrow. Keir Starmer has given an interview to broadcasters following the news that a joint Dutch/Belgian/British investigation has led to an arrest in Amsterdam of a man suspected of playing a key role in supplying small boats. (See 1.19pm.) After the new government abandoned the Tories\u2019 Rwanda policy, Starmer has been keen to show that his policy, which involves a beefed-up focus on breaking up people-smuggling gangs, provides a viable alternative. He said this arrest showed that international law enforcement cooperation can deliver results. He said: The entire focus until we had the election was on a gimmick, the Rwanda gimmick, and not enough attention was on taking down the gangs that are running this vile trade. I\u2019ve long said that there is a serious issue in people-smuggling and that the only way to deal with it is to take down the gangs, the groups that are running this vile trade \u2026 This is a significant arrest, and it follows careful work by the National Crime Agency \u2013 some of which I went to look at myself not so many weeks ago \u2013 intelligence gathering work, collaboration, co-operating across borders, exactly the serious response that we need to a very serious problem. Explaining why arrests like this would make a difference, Starmer said: I don\u2019t accept the proposition that none of this is worth doing because somebody else pops up. We are taking down the gangs. It\u2019s a step. It\u2019s an important step. Of course, there are going to be other steps that are necessary \u2026 If the boats and the engines aren\u2019t available, it obviously makes it much more difficult for these crossings to be made and we\u2019re dealing with gangs and groups that are making a huge amount of money from this vile trade. And so it is really important that we take these vital steps against them in relation to disrupting their pattern and the way that they do their business. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s very significant that this arrest has taken place today. This is a significant piece of the jigsaw. I\u2019m not pretending it\u2019s the silver bullet. There are other steps that are going to be necessary, but this is a very important step. Keir Starmer has said the arrest of a 44-year-old Turkish man suspected of being a supplier of small boats was a \u201csignificant piece of the jigsaw\u201d in tackling Channel migrant crossings but \u201cI\u2019m not pretending it\u2019s the silver bullet\u201d, PA Media says. PA reports: The suspect was detained at Schipol Airport in Amsterdam on Wednesday after a joint investigation by Dutch and Belgian authorities and the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency (NCA). He is suspected of shipping dinghies and engines from Turkey and storing them in Germany, before they are moved to northern France for crossings. The man is facing extradition to Belgium over charges of human smuggling, the spokesman added. The prime minister has put international co-operation with law enforcement agencies in Europe at the heart of his efforts to cut small boat crossings. So far this year more than 32,000 people have arrived in the UK having made the journey across the English Channel by boat, according to Home Office figures. John Swinney has come under fire from Tories, Labour and Lib Dems at FMQs over two key health issues this week \u2013 the row about health secretary Neil Gray taking ministerial cars to travel to football games, and the ongoing \u201cshambles\u201d of Scottish government attempts to create a national care service. At first minister\u2019s questions in Holyrood, Scottish Tory leader Russell Findlay told Swinney that the SNP government had \u201ca reckless disregard for taxpayer\u2019s money\u201d. He went on: Health secretary Neil Gray takes limos to the football. John Swinney wastes cash on the national care service that everybody knows is not going to work. Later this afternoon Gray will make a statement to the chamber to explain why he needed the chauffeur-driven cars to take him to his favourite football team, Aberdeen\u2019s, matches at Hampden three times in six months. And earlier today the Scottish government insisted that plans to centralise adult social care currently delivered by local authorities into a single body accountable to the Scottish government had not been ditched but delayed again, with a revised timetable worked out in the new year. Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said that Swinney had \u201cwasted \u00a330m and three years on the wrong solution\u201d and that the plans have been significantly delayed because of uncertainty over costs and the withdrawal of support by key unions. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the plans were \u201copposed by care users, unions and experts and nothing more than an expensive power grab that would do nothing to improve the lives of care users\u201d. But Swinney insisted that disabled people\u2019s organisations, carers and service users have all pressed for a national service and that the revised timetable would allow for time to put in place arrangements to tackle the current postcode lottery. Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP who has tabled the private member\u2019s bill on assisted dying that will be debated two weeks tomorrow, has said she is \u201cdisappointed\u201d by Wes Streeting, the health secretary, saying the new law could cut funding for other NHS services. Streeting made the claim yesterday, in an interview that implies he is increasingly keen to ensure that MPs vote down the terminally ill adults (end of life) bill at second reading. Asked about Streeting\u2019s comments, Leadbeater told PoliticsHome: I\u2019m disappointed that the health secretary came out to speak about the bill before he had even seen the bill, and a couple of comments that were made on the media \u2026 would suggest he hasn\u2019t read the bill. So, that is disappointing. She also implied that Streeting was in breach of an instruction to ministers that they should not take part in the public debate on the bill. She said: The important thing is that this debate happens, and everybody is absolutely entitled to their different views on the issue. But I have found it disappointing that some members of the cabinet have spoken out very vocally on the issue, and others have done as instructed and not expressed their views. So, I\u2019ve found that quite disappointing and quite upsetting. Last month Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, distributed a letter to cabinet ministers telling them that the government was neutral on the bill. He said that in interviews they could confirm their previously stated views on the issue, but he said they \u201cshould exercise discretion and should not take part in the public debate\u201d. Airline passengers will benefit from tougher enforcement of consumer protection laws following an inquiry into the August 2023 air traffic control meltdown, transport secretary Louise Haigh has said. A minister has criticised her Tory shadow for talking about \u201cjoy\u201d in the health sector about the funding it received. Karin Smyth, a health minister, said it was a strange word to use given the state of NHS finances left by the last government. She was speaking in response to an urgent question about the impact of the national insurance increase on GPs, care homes and hospices tabled by the shadow health minister, Dr Luke Evans. Evans said: Many in the health sector would have been pleased to hear the announcement of the extra funding going into the NHS [in the budget], only for the joy to be struck down by the realisation of a broken manifesto promise not to raise national insurance contributions. This was only compounded further on the discovery that a raft of frontline care providers \u2013 care homes, hospices, care charities, pharmacies, GPS, to name but a few \u2013 found themselves not exempt from the NI rises, leaving them with crippling staff bills and the threat of closure and redundancies. Smyth said she was as \u201cdumbfounded\u201d by Evans\u2019 comments, adding: He talks about joy. There was no joy when we inherited the mess that they left back in July. Smyth said the government \u201cunderstands the pressures\u201d on GPs and other healthcare providers as a result of the national insurance increase and that funding allocations were being looked at. She said: The chancellor took into account the impact of changes to national insurance when she allocated an extra \u00a326bn to the Department of Health and Social Care. There are well established processes for agreeing funding allocations across the system, we are going through those processes now with this issue in mind. Mary Lou McDonald, president of Sinn F\u00e9in, has said Keir Starmer must set out the circumstances in which he will call a referendum on a united Ireland. McDonald, who is campaigning to be Ireland\u2019s new prime minister as part of a general election campaign, said she would produce a green paper on unification within 100 days of taking office, if successful. Recent polls show Sinn F\u00e9in, which two years ago was the most popular party in Ireland despite being in opposition, will struggle to be returned as the largest party after the ballot on 29 November. Nonetheless the party is keeping the pressure up and says it would dedicate a junior ministry within the department of the taoiseach dedicated to the party\u2019s long term goal of a single government on the island of Ireland. The Good Friday agreement says a referendum, or border poll, should take place if the government believes a majority of people in Northern Ireland would vote in favour of reunification. There would be a vote in Northern Ireland and in Ireland. In theory a simple majority would be enough for reunification to happen, but many people believe support would have to be much higher for the vote to carry authority. Starmer has already said the prospect is \u201cnot even on the horizon\u201d. McDonald told reporters: The British government needs to start now indicating for them what they believe is the tipping point at which they believe a referendum would be called. Jim McMahon, the local government minister, has posted this on social media making a similar point to the one that Matthew Pennycook was making in the Commons. (See 11.16am.) Kemi was of course local government minister when council tax limits were set at 5%. The budget which followed planned the same for every year to 2028. They now want the investment but not the tax they planned for. The same approach which left taxpayers with a \u00a322bn blackhole. As the UQ on council tax went on, Matthew Pennycook, the housing minister, mocked the opposition for not having a clear position on what the council tax cap should be. He also pointed out that, while Kemi Badenoch was implying at PMQs yesterday the cap was too high, her councillors want the cap removed altogether. In his response to Pennycook\u2019s opening statement (see 10.42am), David Simmonds, a Conservative local government, claimed there was a \u00a33.7bn black hole in local government finance \u2013 which he defined as the gap between the planned in increase in local government spending (\u00a33.7bn), and the extra grant allocated (\u00a31.3bn). He also asked what services might be cut if the 5% cap on council tax increases allowed without a referendum remained in place. The UQ seemed inspired by today\u2019s Daily Mail splash. (See 9.22am.) Pennycook said that he did not recognise the \u00a32.4bn figure quoted by Simmonds. He said he assumed it did not include extra money councils would get from business rates, and as a result of new homes being built. He repeated the point about how the current 5% cap, which is being maintained, was Conservative policy. (See 10.42am.) And he went on: The question for the opposition is are they saying that that cap should be abolished, as the Rebuilding the Road to Victory Conservative LGA [Local Government Association] document called for? Or are they saying that limit should be reduced, which would be contrary to the policy that was in place when the now leader of the opposition [Kemi Badenoch] was local government minister. At a briefing yesterday after PMQs, the Tories refused to say what they wanted to happen to the cap. But in the Rebuilding the Road to Victory document produced by the Tory LGA group before the general election, Conserative local government leaders proposed: Remove the caps on council tax (mirroring the existing arrangements for parish councils) which will allow councillors to be held accountable for their decisions on taxation at the ballot box. This recommendation if adopted would highlight to government just how financially prudent Conservative councils can be. UPDATE: This is what a Conservative spokesperson said at a post-PMQs briefing yesterday when asked what the party would do to tackle the shortfall that it says exists in local government funding. It is not for us to say, we are in opposition. It is for the government, and we\u2019ve just heard them say that the council tax cap is not going to change. So it is now for the government to spell out how they expect councils to deal with that shortfall. In the Commons Matthew Pennycook, the housing minister, is responding to the urgent question about council tax. (See 9.41am.) He says there have been caps on the extent to which councils can raise council tax every year since 2012. And he says the current cap \u2013 5% for councils which have social care responsibilities \u2013 were put in place by the last government. Any council that wants to go beyond the cap has to hold a referendum. He says, when the last government was in office, the Office for Budget Responsibility assumed that councils would put up council tax by 5% in all years going ahead. He also accuses the Conservatives of leaving local government finance in \u201ca mess\u201d. Ministers are urging the live music industry to impose a voluntary levy on tickets to large concerts at stadiums and arenas to help fund grassroots venues. They want the scheme to come into effect next year. They have said they will consider the effectiveness of this move before deciding if further measures are needed to help small venues. As PA Media reports, some bands have already taken the step to donate a portion of ticket sales to help fund smaller venues. Enter Shikari gave \u00a31 of every ticket sold for their 2024 arena tour to the Music Venue Trust charity as a gesture of support for the grassroots live music sector. Coldplay have also pledged to donate 10% of profits from their upcoming UK stadium tour to support smaller venues. In a statement, Chris Bryant, the culture minister, said: Grassroots music venues are one of the UK\u2019s most valuable and yet undervalued cultural assets. They are where bands try out new material, where whole new genres are born, where musicians experiment and where audiences get to experience the raw power of live music. These venues support thousands of jobs and are a vital part of our local communities. Without a flourishing grassroots music industry the rest of our music industry will wither. It is crucial that we work together to support the grassroots including venues, festivals, artists and promoters. That is why I am urging the industry voluntarily to introduce a ticket levy on the biggest commercial players, to help ensure the health and future success of our entire live music industry for decades to come. Prof Sir Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, has put out a statement welcoming the waiting list reduction (see 9.53am), but saying the health service will be busier than ever before this winter. He says: The NHS is going into winter under more pressure and busier than ever before, with another record month for A&amp;E and ambulance services before we even start to see a further spike of pressure caused by colder weather and the spread of winter viruses. While we saw 10% more A&amp;E patients within four hours than last year despite the record demand, it is vital that people help us out by only going to A&amp;E or calling 999 in a life-threatening emergency, using 111 for other conditions, and getting their Covid, flu and RSV vaccinations if eligible. However, thanks to the efforts of our amazing staff, these figures also show how they are making use of the latest innovations, including surgical hubs, to bring down waiting lists and deliver 7% more treatments than the same month pre-pandemic, while also delivering more tests and checks than any other September. While we continue to treat record numbers and deal with record demand, it is clear that is still much further to go to return performance to the levels patients should expect and we will continue to work with government on the 10 Year Health Plan to address the needs of patients. The waiting list for routine hospital treatment in England has fallen to its lowest level for five months, PA Media reports. PA says: An estimated 7.57 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of September, relating to 6.34 million patients \u2013 down from 7.64 million treatments and 6.42 million patients at the end of August, NHS England said. These are the lowest figures since April 2024. The list hit a record high in September 2023, with 7.77 million treatments and 6.50 million patients. There will be two urgent questions in the Commons after 10.30am, both tabled by Conservative MPs. First, a local government minister will respond to a UQ from David Simmonds about the cap for council tax rises. And then a health minister will respond to a UQ from Luke Evans about the impact of the employers\u2019 national insurance increase on GPs, care homes and hospices. Good morning. We\u2019re two weeks on from the budget, and from the government\u2019s point of view it seems to have landed quite well. Nothing has unravelled, there have not been any U-turns (yet?) and Labour is confident that it has manoeuvred the Tories into a position where they are attacking the budget tax rises but backing the budget spending measures \u2013 an irrational position that is ultimately unsustainable. But that does not mean budget-related problems for the government have gone away, as a quick look at today\u2019s front pages will show. The Times is splashing a story about on ongoing complaints from business about the impact of the national insurance tax increase. It says \u201ca post-budget survey of 185 businesses by the CBI found that 61 per cent of companies polled had formed a negative view of [Rachel] Reeves\u2019s announcements, while 60 per cent said it had made Britain a less attractive place to invest.\u201d The Daily Mail is splashing on a story about how councils in England will be allowed to raise council tax by up to 5% next year without holding a referendum. This is exactly the same cap that has been in place since 2022, but a 5% rise would now be above inflation, and the Conservatives are suggesting the cap should be lower. And Sir Mark Rowley, the Metropolitan police commissioner, has given an interview to the BBC saying there will be \u201ceye-watering cuts\u201d to the police in London because of a lack of government funding. It is not unusual for people running big public service organisations to complain about their budgets when they are negotiating with Whitehall for money, but Rowley\u2019s comments are striking nevertheless. In an interview with Nick Robinson for his Political Thinking podcast Rowley said he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the situation he was in. He explained: This is not just about this year\u2019s decisions, but it\u2019s a cumulative effect of decisions over the last decade or so which have put us in a more and more precarious position. Some of the things that successive commissioners and mayors have used to balance the books - like selling police stations and using reserves - all of those things have run out. So those are propped up the budget. Those props have gone. The chancellor has been very clear - it\u2019s a difficult public sector context. You add all those things together and you get a dramatic change in budgets, and of a scale that\u2019s never going to be absorbed by efficiencies. And it\u2019s going to require some pretty eye-watering cuts to the services we provide to London. Rowley said he faced some \u201cvery, very difficult choices\u201d and that these would become clear to the public \u201cover the next few weeks\u201d. The government says it will increase spending on the police next year, but individual force budgets have not been decided yet. It wants to talk about pension funds instead. Reeves is delivering her Mansion House speech tonight and, as Kalyeena Makortoff reports, she is going to announce plans to merge local government retirement schemes into \u201cmegafunds\u201d.

      "body": "<p>This was the sort of day of which all governments dream. A day in which all opposition was reduced to noises off at best. When no crises were on the horizon and most of Westminster was fast asleep. When ministers could get on with their jobs with no outside interventions. A day when the government got to control the news grid.</p> <p>Over in the Treasury, Rachel Reeves was putting the final touches to her Mansion House speech. Her chance to mend fences with the City after raising employers\u2019 national insurance contributions in the budget. Still, at least they vaguely understood the numbers. Kemi Badenoch had proved herself to be totally financially illiterate at the previous day\u2019s prime minister\u2019s questions. For Rachel, a top Conservative team of Kemi, Mel Stride, Priti Patel and Chris Philp was a dream quartet. Not all chancellors are so blessed.</p> <p>The only slight annoyance on the horizon was Donald Trump. While assembling his own team of oddballs, unqualified culture war warriors and someone once accused of sex offences, the president-elect had casually announced he would be imposing 20% tariffs on all imports. So much for the special relationship.</p> <p>Weirdly, even Nigel Farage had gone silent at that. Normally, the Donald\u2019s Unloved Mini Me never misses an opportunity to say how wonderful his idol is. Only on Wednesday, he was suggesting British foreign policy should be written to suit the incoming US administration.</p> <p>Instead, we got tumbleweed rolling through GB News. Maybe even Nige is finding it difficult to explain how a \u00a320bn hit to UK exports will be good for the country. I guess he just thinks Trump would make an exception for Britain if he were in charge.</p> <p>Or maybe he\u2019s too busy compiling his fantasy government in exile. Nige as prime minister. Natch. Dicky Tice, a man who made a small fortune by starting with a big one, in charge of the economy. Laurence Fox as ambassador to the US. Calvin Robinson as the new archbishop of Canterbury. What could possibly go wrong?</p> <p>Meanwhile in Downing St, Keir Starmer was allowing himself a minor celebration with the news that the first arrest of a person suspected of people trafficking had been made after a joint investigation by a British, Belgian and Dutch taskforce. \u201cIt\u2019s an important first step,\u201d he said. Before saying other steps would be needed. But hey! One arrest was one more than the last Tory government had ever made. And it was a great deal more credible than a Rwandan plan that had only managed to deport four volunteers. Keir was learning there was something to be said for a low bar.</p> <p>Even in the Commons there was little sign of any real opposition to disrupt the government\u2019s narrative. Indeed, the biggest obstacle, Steve Reed, the environment secretary, faced at Defra questions was himself. You get the feeling that the Streatham and Croydon MP\u2019s heart really isn\u2019t in the countryside. He tries to look interested but then the spirit leaves him. It takes a lot to make his Tory opposite number, Victoria Atkins, look halfway competent but somehow he manages it.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Atkins chose to use her two questions on the ongoing row on inheritance tax for farmers. Only the day before, the farming minister, Daniel Zeichner, had told a conference that there was a discrepancy in the numbers. While Treasury figures showed that just 28% of farms were worth more than the \u00a31m, Defra\u2019s own statistics indicated that 66% of farms exceeded the inheritance tax threshold. Atkins quite sensibly suggested it might have been an idea for the left hand to speak to the right before the budget announcement was made.</p> <p>Reed\u2019s answer was more or less unintelligible. He could have said that tax experts were forecasting the vast majority of farmers would be unaffected but that in any case the department was taking the matter seriously. Instead, he mumbled something about farmers being \u201creasonable people\u201d and that they should trust the Treasury figures. Rather implying that if farmers put their mind to it and believed their farm was worth less than it was then all would be well. Not his finest hour.</p> <p>The only other curiosity of note at Defra questions was a rare sighting of Rishi Sunak on the back benches having remembered belatedly that he represents a rural Yorkshire seat. Though, like Reed, he looks and sounds like a townie through and through. Unlike many of his Tory colleagues, he was unbothered by inheritance tax for farmers. He was far more concerned about his own legacy, desperate that the new government should maintain his food security index. Reed said he would handle the data in his own way. Which, given his track record, wasn\u2019t entirely reassuring to his ministerial team.</p> <p>We then moved on to two urgent questions. Here you had to feel sorry for shadow housing minister David Simmonds, who had been sent out to make trouble over a \u00a32.4bn black hole in the council tax budget that Kemi thought she had uncovered the day before. Only she hadn\u2019t, because \u2013 as discussed previously \u2013 she is hopeless at maths and the \u00a32.4bn never existed in the first place. She had yet again forgotten the 5% cap was something her own government had created and that Tory councils were pushing for a lifting of the cap to increase council tax by more.</p> <p>Poor David. He is a nice man. A gentle soul who means no ill to anyone and he deserved better from his party. Perhaps realising this, the junior minister, Matthew Pennycook, went relatively easy on him. Pointing out one or two elementary mistakes in the maths along with the flaw in logic but not rubbing it in. No point in being a hard arse just for the hell of it.</p> <p>Next came a UQ on national insurance contributions for GPs, hospices and care homes. This was also telling because most Tory MPs were more plaintive than angry. As if they accept their own government wrecked the economy and starved the NHS of funds. Even old warhorse Edward Leigh couldn\u2019t defend his party, choosing instead to make the case for relief on behalf of a local hospice. The shadow cabinet may still be in denial but Tory backbenchers aren\u2019t. They can see the writing of their legacy on the wall.</p> <p>It\u2019s Westminster politics. But not as we\u2019ve known it in the last decade.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Taking the Lead by John Crace is published by Little, Brown (\u00a318.99).

      "bodyText": "This was the sort of day of which all governments dream. A day in which all opposition was reduced to noises off at best. When no crises were on the horizon and most of Westminster was fast asleep. When ministers could get on with their jobs with no outside interventions. A day when the government got to control the news grid. Over in the Treasury, Rachel Reeves was putting the final touches to her Mansion House speech. Her chance to mend fences with the City after raising employers\u2019 national insurance contributions in the budget. Still, at least they vaguely understood the numbers. Kemi Badenoch had proved herself to be totally financially illiterate at the previous day\u2019s prime minister\u2019s questions. For Rachel, a top Conservative team of Kemi, Mel Stride, Priti Patel and Chris Philp was a dream quartet. Not all chancellors are so blessed. The only slight annoyance on the horizon was Donald Trump. While assembling his own team of oddballs, unqualified culture war warriors and someone once accused of sex offences, the president-elect had casually announced he would be imposing 20% tariffs on all imports. So much for the special relationship. Weirdly, even Nigel Farage had gone silent at that. Normally, the Donald\u2019s Unloved Mini Me never misses an opportunity to say how wonderful his idol is. Only on Wednesday, he was suggesting British foreign policy should be written to suit the incoming US administration. Instead, we got tumbleweed rolling through GB News. Maybe even Nige is finding it difficult to explain how a \u00a320bn hit to UK exports will be good for the country. I guess he just thinks Trump would make an exception for Britain if he were in charge. Or maybe he\u2019s too busy compiling his fantasy government in exile. Nige as prime minister. Natch. Dicky Tice, a man who made a small fortune by starting with a big one, in charge of the economy. Laurence Fox as ambassador to the US. Calvin Robinson as the new archbishop of Canterbury. What could possibly go wrong? Meanwhile in Downing St, Keir Starmer was allowing himself a minor celebration with the news that the first arrest of a person suspected of people trafficking had been made after a joint investigation by a British, Belgian and Dutch taskforce. \u201cIt\u2019s an important first step,\u201d he said. Before saying other steps would be needed. But hey! One arrest was one more than the last Tory government had ever made. And it was a great deal more credible than a Rwandan plan that had only managed to deport four volunteers. Keir was learning there was something to be said for a low bar. Even in the Commons there was little sign of any real opposition to disrupt the government\u2019s narrative. Indeed, the biggest obstacle, Steve Reed, the environment secretary, faced at Defra questions was himself. You get the feeling that the Streatham and Croydon MP\u2019s heart really isn\u2019t in the countryside. He tries to look interested but then the spirit leaves him. It takes a lot to make his Tory opposite number, Victoria Atkins, look halfway competent but somehow he manages it. Unsurprisingly, Atkins chose to use her two questions on the ongoing row on inheritance tax for farmers. Only the day before, the farming minister, Daniel Zeichner, had told a conference that there was a discrepancy in the numbers. While Treasury figures showed that just 28% of farms were worth more than the \u00a31m, Defra\u2019s own statistics indicated that 66% of farms exceeded the inheritance tax threshold. Atkins quite sensibly suggested it might have been an idea for the left hand to speak to the right before the budget announcement was made. Reed\u2019s answer was more or less unintelligible. He could have said that tax experts were forecasting the vast majority of farmers would be unaffected but that in any case the department was taking the matter seriously. Instead, he mumbled something about farmers being \u201creasonable people\u201d and that they should trust the Treasury figures. Rather implying that if farmers put their mind to it and believed their farm was worth less than it was then all would be well. Not his finest hour. The only other curiosity of note at Defra questions was a rare sighting of Rishi Sunak on the back benches having remembered belatedly that he represents a rural Yorkshire seat. Though, like Reed, he looks and sounds like a townie through and through. Unlike many of his Tory colleagues, he was unbothered by inheritance tax for farmers. He was far more concerned about his own legacy, desperate that the new government should maintain his food security index. Reed said he would handle the data in his own way. Which, given his track record, wasn\u2019t entirely reassuring to his ministerial team. We then moved on to two urgent questions. Here you had to feel sorry for shadow housing minister David Simmonds, who had been sent out to make trouble over a \u00a32.4bn black hole in the council tax budget that Kemi thought she had uncovered the day before. Only she hadn\u2019t, because \u2013 as discussed previously \u2013 she is hopeless at maths and the \u00a32.4bn never existed in the first place. She had yet again forgotten the 5% cap was something her own government had created and that Tory councils were pushing for a lifting of the cap to increase council tax by more. Poor David. He is a nice man. A gentle soul who means no ill to anyone and he deserved better from his party. Perhaps realising this, the junior minister, Matthew Pennycook, went relatively easy on him. Pointing out one or two elementary mistakes in the maths along with the flaw in logic but not rubbing it in. No point in being a hard arse just for the hell of it. Next came a UQ on national insurance contributions for GPs, hospices and care homes. This was also telling because most Tory MPs were more plaintive than angry. As if they accept their own government wrecked the economy and starved the NHS of funds. Even old warhorse Edward Leigh couldn\u2019t defend his party, choosing instead to make the case for relief on behalf of a local hospice. The shadow cabinet may still be in denial but Tory backbenchers aren\u2019t. They can see the writing of their legacy on the wall. It\u2019s Westminster politics. But not as we\u2019ve known it in the last decade. Taking the Lead by John Crace is published by Little, Brown (\u00a318.99).

It\u2019s vital that we address the urgent need for a national prostate cancer screening programme \u2013 a step that could save countless lives if only we had the political will to make it happen. It\u2019s appalling that so many men are left to navigate this on their own.\u201d",

Rajan Naidu, 73, of Birmingham, and Niamh Lynch, 22, of Bedford, have been charged with destroying or damaging an ancient protected monument and intentionally or recklessly causing a public nuisance. The pair were bailed to appear at Salisbury magistrates court on 13 December, Wiltshire police said. The alleged incident occurred during a protest by the environmental activists Just Stop Oil in mid-June as thousands of druids and revellers prepared to travel to the world-renowned monument for the summer solstice. Sophie Stevens, deputy chief crown prosecutor for CPS Wessex, said: \u201cThe Crown Prosecution Service has authorised Wiltshire police to charge Rajan Naidu and Niamh Lynch with offences related to damage caused to the protected monument Stonehenge on 19 June. \u201cI would like to remind all concerned that there are active criminal proceedings against these individuals, and they have the right to a fair trial. There must be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online that may in any way prejudice these proceedings.\u201d After the protest, English Heritage said experts had quickly removed the orange powder from the stones, the first of which were put in place around 3000BC. In a statement released at the time, Just Stop Oil said it was time for \u201cmegalithic action\u201d and called for the next UK government to agree a plan to stop the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030.",

In addition, there is added uncertainty about future changes to policy stringency that may further accentuate macroeconomic volatility.</p> </blockquote> <p>A second risk is <strong>global trade fragmentation</strong>, as shocks can be transmitted to the UK via the exchange rate, imports and exports, as well as financial markets.</p> <p><strong>Mann</strong> points out that uncertainty about trade policy in itself may have damaging economic effects and increase volatility, adding:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The latest political developments across the Atlantic have not made a disorderly trade scenario less likely, which would have consequences for output and inflation in the UK.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Financial Market volatility </strong>and <strong>policy-induced volatility and spillovers </strong>are also potential threats, she adds.</p> <p><strong>Mann</strong> \u2013 who <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-summary-and-minutes/2024/november-2024\">opposed last week\u2019s cut to UK interest rates</a> - concludes that these risks, and uncertainty about the economic outlook, are a reason to leave borrowing costs on hold:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the face of uncertainties about the outlook for inflation and output, waiting buys time to learn more about developments, to make a better assessment of whether the inflation risk has subsided sufficiently to justify changing the policy stance. In the current context, an activist stance holds the policy rate firmly until sufficient evidence on diminished inflation persistence is revealed; and then to move forcefully.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6735f0528f08ac207a0fe6a4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-14T12:46:11.447Z\">12.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Disney\u2019s Experiences division, which includes its theme parks, resorts and cruise ships, has achieved record revenue and operating income for the last year.</strong></p> <p>In today\u2019s results, the company says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In Q4, Experiences revenue increased $0.1bn, or 1%, and operating income of $1.7bn was a decline of $0.1bn, or 6% compared to the prior-year quarter.</p> <p>Domestic Parks &amp; Experiences operating income increased in Q4, on comparable attendance to the prior-year quarter, driven by higher guest spending, partially offset by higher expenses and costs related to new guest offerings driven by Disney Cruise Line.

At the end of last month, it hit a record of $2,790 per ounce, but has been dipping through November.</p> <p><strong>George Saravelos, of Deutsche Bank Research, </strong>says this fall has \u201cconfounded expectations\u201d, and cites three messages we can take from it:</p> <ol> <li><p><strong>This market is NOT worried about US credit risk. </strong>If the market was becoming concerned about excessive fiscal deficits, fiscal dominance and a loss of central bank independence in the US gold would be the first thing that would be going up. This is of course also reflected in the very muted moves in US term premia and inflation break-evens so far. We see gold price action as confirming the argument we have been making throughout the year that the US is not at risk of a twin deficit currency crisis any time soon.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Demand for gold reserves from central banks is going down. </strong>The reasoning here is simple: Trump policy is likely to put weakening pressure on many emerging market currencies most notably CNY. By extension, many central banks now need to spend dollar reserves to defend their FX from capital outflows and prevent excessive weakening. We have been showing that Asian central banks have been diversifying their holdings in to gold. They now have to spend more of these dollars defending their currencies instead.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>The USD remains the pre-eminent safe-haven currency of choice. </strong>Some have been arguing that the dollar\u2019s appeal is in structural decline, with the weaponization of sanctions and trade a key driver. In contrast, our view has been the opposite: while <em>public</em> sector demand for dollar assets might be dropping, <em>private </em>sector demand has been rising and matters much more: the greater the risk a government gets sanctioned by the US, the bigger the net demand for dollars. Price action since the US election victory is therefore not only consistent with a rising <em>risky asset</em> demand for US assets (US over global equities<em>) </em>but safe-haven demand too (dollar up against all global FX and gold).</p></li> </ol> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6735d0008f0853b3aa362142\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-14T10:32:55.474Z\">10.32am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ukrainian government bonds are rallying again this morning, on anticipation that Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House could end its war with Russia.</strong></p> <p>Reuters has the details:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Longer-dated maturities saw the biggest gains, with 2035 paper rising 2.6 cents to be bid at 56.73 cents, its highest. since the bonds were launched in early September as part of the country\u2019s debt restructuring, Tradeweb data showed.</p> <p>Trump has pledged a quick end to the Russia-Ukraine war once he takes office in January, but he has yet to share details on how he would achieve it.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6735cd568f08fc3bf2f7f6fe\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-14T10:19:17.640Z\">10.19am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK mortgage rates rise</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Bad news for those looking to buy a house in the UK: mortgage rates are moving up again.</strong></p> <p>Moneyfacts has reported that the average fixed-term mortgage rates have risen this morning, even though the Bank of England cut interest rates last week.</p> <p>They report:</p> <ul> <li><p>The average 2-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 5.48%.

There\u2019s a reason that an occupational scheme has a trustee to look after the interests of members. Part of that is investing their money to maximise returns and get the best retirement outcomes possible.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Selby </strong>adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Conflating a government goal of driving investment in the UK and people\u2019s retirement outcomes brings a danger because the risks are all taken with members\u2019 money.

One of the strengths of the system we have today is that investment decisions for members of defined contribution (DC) default funds and defined benefit (DB) schemes have independence baked in, usually via the appointment of trustees. Those trustees are required to make those decisions first-and-foremost with the aim of delivering the highest possible income in retirement for members.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-14T07:39:18.110Z\">at 7.39am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6734e37e8f0839ad951d7c38\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-14T07:27:30.579Z\">7.27am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Introduction: Renters are squeezed by lower supply and rising prices</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy.</strong></p> <p>UK tenants are facing a \u201cchasm\u201d when trying to find a property to rent, surveyors are warning today, as demand rises and the supply of rental properties falls.</p> <p><strong>The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS)</strong> has reported that renters are being squeezed by lower supply and rising prices in the lettings market.

      "bodyText": "Time to recap. Average UK mortgage rates have risen as major lenders hike their rates, despite the Bank of England\u2019s cut to borrowing costs last week. The European Commission has fined Meta almost \u20ac800m for breaching EU competition law with its classified ads service, Facebook Marketplace. Luxury goods maker Burberry has posted its biggest share price jump in the last 20 years, after announcing a cost-cutting scheme and a turnaround plan. The pound has recovered earlier losses, which saw it hit its lowest level against the US dollar since July. Gas prices in the UK and Europe hit their highest level in a year, due to fears of supply disruption from Russia and the colder weather. Shares in Disney have hit a six-month high, after it beat Wall Street expectations thanks to its Inside Out 2 and Deadpool &amp; Wolverine films. Rachel Reeves will announce plans to merge local government retirement schemes into \u201cmegafunds\u201d as she tries to revive long-running efforts to overhaul the public pension system. Burberry has posted its best day on the London stock market in at least the last 20 years. Shares in the luxury goods maker have closed for the night up 18.6%, which is its biggest daily rise since at least November 2004 (my data doesn\u2019t go any further back!). The City are welcoming Burberry\u2019s new \u00a340m cost-cutting programme and turnaround plan to revive the fortunes of the ailing British luxury fashion brand. Geopolitical uncertainties and rising costs are encouraging companies to \u2018reshore\u2019 their operations closer to home, a new survey from Bain &amp; Company shows. Bain\u2019s biennial operations survey of CEOs and chief operating officers has found a rise in companies planning, or already investing in and executing, reshoring and near-shoring. According to Bain, 81% of CEOs and COOs say their companies have plans to bring supply chains closer to home or to their main market, up from 63% in 2022. There\u2019s also increased interest in \u2018split-shoring\u2019, where businesses balance a mix of offshore production with other key manufacturing activity close to home. One factor is that companies are trying to cut their dependence on China. A second is Joe Biden\u2019s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which provides US companies with subsidies and tax credits to incentivize reshoring and near-shoring. Hernan Saenz, partner at Bain &amp; Company and global head of its Performance Improvement practice, says: \u201cWe believe the current acceleration of reshoring across key markets worldwide is a crucial trend that demands CEOs\u2019 attention. The multiple disruptions companies have grappled with since the pandemic mean the question for company leaders is no longer whether to reinvent supply chains but how to do that so their operations are made more cost-competitive, resilient, sustainable, and agile in responding to evolving markets and customer needs.\u201d Although the euro has also recovered from its earlier lows, the growing economic gap between the US and Europe threatens to weigh on the currency in future, economist Mohamed El-Erian has warned. El-Erian, the chief economic adviser to Allianz, told Bloomberg TV today: \u201cIf you look at the good, the bad and the ugly of the global economy, unfortunately Europe is the ugly. The market has understood that divergence is a major story going forward.\u201d Back in the financial markets, the pound has recovered its earlier losses against the US dollar to trade just over $1.27. Meta has pledged to appeal against the EU\u2019s fine. It says: \u201cToday, the European Commission announced a decision claiming that Facebook Marketplace has hindered competition for online marketplaces in Europe. \u201cThis decision ignores the realities of the thriving European market for online classified listing services and shields large incumbent companies from a new entrant, Facebook Marketplace, that meets consumer demand in innovative and convenient new ways. \u201cWe will appeal this decision to ensure that consumers are well served in the EU.\u201d The European Commission has fined Meta almost \u20ac800m for breaching EU competition law with its classified ads service, Facebook Marketplace. The Commission fined Meta \u20ac797.72m for tying Marketplace to its Facebook social media platform, which meant consumers on Facebook were regularly exposed to Marketplace whether or not they wanted to be. This gave Meta a \u201csubstantial distribution advantage\u201d over rival classified ad platforms. The ruling also said Meta had unilaterally imposed unfair trading conditions on other classified ads services providers who advertise on Meta\u2019s platforms, including allowing Meta to use ad-related data generated by other advertisers for the benefit of Facebook Marketplace. It orders Meta to bring the conduct to an end and refrain from repeating the infringement, in addition to the fine. The Commission said that while market dominance was in itself not illegal under EU antitrust rules, dominant companies have a special responsibility not to abuse their powerful market position by restricting competition. Margrethe Vestager, executive vice-president of the Commission in charge of competition policy, says: \u201cToday we fine Meta 797.72 million euros for abusing its dominant positions in the markets for personal social network services and for online display advertising on social media platforms. \u201cMeta tied its online classified ads service Facebook Marketplace to its personal social network Facebook and imposed unfair trading conditions on other online classified ads service providers. \u201cIt did so to benefit its own service Facebook Marketplace, thereby giving it advantages that other online classified ads service providers could not match. This is illegal under EU antitrust rules. \u201cMeta must now stop this behaviour.\u201d The average cost of household building work is up by almost a fifth (19%) on the last quarter, according to new data reported by PA Media today. The average cost of a building job is now \u00a312,634 due to the higher cost of labour and materials, up from \u00a310,626 in July to September this year, Checkatrade\u2019s inaugural UK Home Improvement Index found. However the increase has not dampened consumer demand, with the number of building jobs up by 1% between quarters one and three, the data, based on more than 10.5 million jobs carried out by tradespeople in the UK, shows. The average cost of a kitchen fitting has gone up by 12% on the previous quarter \u2013 now \u00a37,376 compared with \u00a36,574, while insulation installation costs are up 20% to an average \u00a34,634. The average cost of a plastering job in the third quarter was up 16% to \u00a32,343 and gardening jobs increased by 10% to \u00a3679. The average \u201chandyman\u201d job \u2013 typically of a smaller scale than building work \u2013 increased by 25% from to \u00a3563. Shares in Disney have jumped almost 10% at the start of trading in New York, as traders welcome its forecast-beating results. They\u2019re up 9.8% at $112.77, their highest level since May. The UK and Scottish governments are to pump \u00a3100m into new energy and economic regeneration projects around the closure-hit Grangemouth oil refinery and the neighbouring town of Falkirk. The deal, which is being signed in Falkirk by Scottish and UK ministers today, includes a new \u201ccarbon utilisation\u201d centre to reuse waste CO2, and a bioeconomy accelerator pilot project for the whisky and food sectors at Grangemouth, where Petro-Ineos plans to close down Scotland\u2019s last oil refinery in June 2025. Its closure, which will lead to more than 400 direct job losses and hit several thousand people in the wider economy, is the most serious immediate challenge to the UK government\u2019s green jobs and energy transition agenda in Scotland, where the oil industry is a powerful force. Highly skilled workers may emigrate, as most face significant uncertainty. There are proposals for carbon capture pilots, and sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen production projects there but widespread scepticism about their likely success. The Scottish and UK governments are co-investing \u00a380m in the overall growth deal and \u00a320m on new energy projects at Grangemouth; Falkirk council and Scottish Canals are spending a further \u00a349m. Forth Valley college will receive funding for a skills transition centre, while money will also be ploughed into regenerating brownfield sites in Grangemouth, new transport hubs and upgrading of the Forth and Clyde canal and its workshops, and an arts park alongside it. Kate Forbes, Scotland\u2019s deputy first minister, said: \u201cThe growth deal will support the region to grasp the opportunities of the transition to net zero and remain at the forefront of innovation and manufacturing in Scotland, complemented by a community-led programme of projects in Grangemouth.\u201d Today\u2019s results from Disney show that CEO Bob Iger\u2019s \u201cquality-over-quantity approach\u201d is paying off, says Adam Vettese, analyst at investment platform eToro: A particular bright spot was the company\u2019s entertainment segment, which enjoyed double-digit growth in revenue and a big bounce in operating income, in part thanks to strong box office results over the summer from such global hits as \u2018Inside Out 2\u2019 and \u2018Deadpool &amp; Wolverine\u2019. \u201cDisney\u2019s streaming business as a whole turned a profit for the first time ever in the previous quarter and the company has seen profits continue to climb in this area, which is quite the turnaround \u2013 just a year ago, the streaming business was bleeding hundreds of millions of dollars per quarter, but now it is making hundreds of millions instead. At this stage, Disney is deep into its shift in focus from linear media networks towards streaming, so a reported 6% decline in revenue from traditional networks is no great cause for consternation, though an accompanying plunge in operating income, including a more than 50% drop for its international linear networks, may still give investors pause. \u201cThere was a small rise in profit at its experiences segment, which includes Disney\u2019s famous theme parks, with healthy growth in domestic income offset by sharp falls in profitability at its various international parks. Forward guidance for the overall company was encouraging, predicting \u2018high-single digit adjusted EPS growth compared to fiscal 2024\u2019 and a $3 billion buyback plan. As a whole, it\u2019s an upbeat earnings report and shares in Disney rose more than 9% in pre-market trading.\u201d Over in the US, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment support has fallen. In a sign that Joe Biden is handing a solid labor market onto Donald Trump, there were 217,000 fresh \u2018initial claims\u2019 for jobless support last week. That\u2019s down from 221,000 the previous week. Bank of England policymaker Catherine Mann is warning that the UK economy is likely to face elevated \u201cmacroeconomic volatility\u201d in the next few years. In a speech to the Annual Conference of the Society of Professional Economists in London this lunchtime, Mann is examining the last forty years of the \u2018Great Moderation\u2019, which brought low inflation and macroeconomic stability. Mann points out that experts disagree on whether good policy or good luck was the prime cause of the Great Moderation (while central bankers tend to believe policy was responsible) One risk that could help unwind the Great Moderation is climate change, she points out, saying: The introduction of various uncoordinated climate mitigation policies may introduce volatility. Price-based instruments such as carbon taxes create volatility in output, and quantity-based instruments such as an ETS create price volatility. In addition, there is added uncertainty about future changes to policy stringency that may further accentuate macroeconomic volatility. A second risk is global trade fragmentation, as shocks can be transmitted to the UK via the exchange rate, imports and exports, as well as financial markets. Mann points out that uncertainty about trade policy in itself may have damaging economic effects and increase volatility, adding: The latest political developments across the Atlantic have not made a disorderly trade scenario less likely, which would have consequences for output and inflation in the UK. Financial Market volatility and policy-induced volatility and spillovers are also potential threats, she adds. Mann \u2013 who opposed last week\u2019s cut to UK interest rates - concludes that these risks, and uncertainty about the economic outlook, are a reason to leave borrowing costs on hold: In the face of uncertainties about the outlook for inflation and output, waiting buys time to learn more about developments, to make a better assessment of whether the inflation risk has subsided sufficiently to justify changing the policy stance. In the current context, an activist stance holds the policy rate firmly until sufficient evidence on diminished inflation persistence is revealed; and then to move forcefully. Disney\u2019s Experiences division, which includes its theme parks, resorts and cruise ships, has achieved record revenue and operating income for the last year. In today\u2019s results, the company says: In Q4, Experiences revenue increased $0.1bn, or 1%, and operating income of $1.7bn was a decline of $0.1bn, or 6% compared to the prior-year quarter. Domestic Parks &amp; Experiences operating income increased in Q4, on comparable attendance to the prior-year quarter, driven by higher guest spending, partially offset by higher expenses and costs related to new guest offerings driven by Disney Cruise Line. International Parks &amp; Experiences operating income declined in Q4. The sucess of this summer\u2019s films Inside Out 2 and Deadpool &amp; Wolverine have helped Walt Disney to forecast-beating results today. Disney has grown its adjusted per-share earnings to $1.14 for the July-September quarter, up from $0.82 a year earlier, and ahead of forecasts of $1.10 per share. Revenues increased by 6% in the quarter, although pre-tax income dipped by 6%. Disney\u2019s Content Sales/Licensing and Other revenues rose by 39% in the quarter. Disney says: Pixar\u2019s Inside Out 2 and Marvel\u2019s Deadpool &amp; Wolverine broke numerous box office records and helped drive $316m in operating income at Content Sales/Licensing and Other in Q4. It also increased its Disney+ Core paid subscriber base by 4.4 million during the quarter, to more than 120 million. Disney has also forecast it will achieve \u201chigh single-digit\u201d growth in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) in the next financial year, rising to \u201cdouble digit adjusted EPS growth\u201d in the 2026 and 2027 fiscal years. CEO Bob Iger says: This was a pivotal and successful year for The Walt Disney Company, and thanks to the significant progress we\u2019ve made, we have emerged from a period of considerable challenges and disruption well positioned for growth and optimistic about our future. The dollar is trading at its highest level against a basket of currencies in over a year. The dollar index is up 0.4% today, to its highest since the start of November 2023, extending the rally which began after the US election. Shares in gold producer Resolute Mining have been suspended at the company\u2019s request, amid a tax row that has seen the company\u2019s CEO detained in Mali. Resolute told shareholders that a temporary halt on trading its shares on the Australian Stock Exchange has begun, and that the company will provide further updates \u201cas and when appropriate\u201d. Its chief executive, Terry Holohan, and two other Resolute employees were detained in Bamako, Mali\u2019s capital, last Friday, after attending a meeting to discuss a demand to repay back taxes and a renegotiation of terms over its Syama gold mine. Bloomberg reports that Mali are demandng Resolute pay about $160m to resolve the tax dispute. Gold is on track for its fifth daily fall in a row. The spot gold price is down 1% today, to $2,547 per ounce. At the end of last month, it hit a record of $2,790 per ounce, but has been dipping through November. George Saravelos, of Deutsche Bank Research, says this fall has \u201cconfounded expectations\u201d, and cites three messages we can take from it: This market is NOT worried about US credit risk. If the market was becoming concerned about excessive fiscal deficits, fiscal dominance and a loss of central bank independence in the US gold would be the first thing that would be going up. This is of course also reflected in the very muted moves in US term premia and inflation break-evens so far. We see gold price action as confirming the argument we have been making throughout the year that the US is not at risk of a twin deficit currency crisis any time soon. Demand for gold reserves from central banks is going down. The reasoning here is simple: Trump policy is likely to put weakening pressure on many emerging market currencies most notably CNY. By extension, many central banks now need to spend dollar reserves to defend their FX from capital outflows and prevent excessive weakening. We have been showing that Asian central banks have been diversifying their holdings in to gold. They now have to spend more of these dollars defending their currencies instead. The USD remains the pre-eminent safe-haven currency of choice. Some have been arguing that the dollar\u2019s appeal is in structural decline, with the weaponization of sanctions and trade a key driver. In contrast, our view has been the opposite: while public sector demand for dollar assets might be dropping, private sector demand has been rising and matters much more: the greater the risk a government gets sanctioned by the US, the bigger the net demand for dollars. Price action since the US election victory is therefore not only consistent with a rising risky asset demand for US assets (US over global equities) but safe-haven demand too (dollar up against all global FX and gold). Ukrainian government bonds are rallying again this morning, on anticipation that Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House could end its war with Russia. Reuters has the details: Longer-dated maturities saw the biggest gains, with 2035 paper rising 2.6 cents to be bid at 56.73 cents, its highest. since the bonds were launched in early September as part of the country\u2019s debt restructuring, Tradeweb data showed. Trump has pledged a quick end to the Russia-Ukraine war once he takes office in January, but he has yet to share details on how he would achieve it. Bad news for those looking to buy a house in the UK: mortgage rates are moving up again. Moneyfacts has reported that the average fixed-term mortgage rates have risen this morning, even though the Bank of England cut interest rates last week. They report: The average 2-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 5.48%. This is up from 5.44% the previous working day. The average 5-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 5.21%. This is up from 5.17% the previous working day. Several banks have raised their mortgage rates in recent days, such as Santander, TSB, HSBC, Virgin Money and Nationwide Building Society. This follows a pick-up in the yields (rate of return) on UK short-term government bonds since the budget. They are used to price mortgage rates, and have risen as traders have anticipated higher borrowing. Statistics body Eurostat has reported that the eurozone economy grew by 0.4% iin the third quarter of this year, matching its initial \u2018flash\u2019 estimate. That means growth accelerated in July-September, up from 0.2% in April-June. Ireland\u2019s GDP grew by 2%, while Spain and the Netherlands both expanded by 0.8%. France\u2019s GDP rose by 0.4%, while Germany lagged behind with 0.2% growth. Eurostat also reports that employment in the eurozone rose by 0.2% in the last quarter. Donald Trump\u2019s election victory last week is continuing to shift the markets. The pound has dropped to its lowest level against the US dollar since early July this morning, down half a cent to $1.2653. On election day, sterling was worth $1.30, but it has been sliding since as traders have anticipated that Trump\u2019s tax cuts and tariffs will be inflationary, meaning US interest rates stay higher. The euro has dropped to a one-year low, at \u20ac1.0524 against the US dollar. These latest losses came as the Republicans secured a majority in the US House of Representatives, which could give Donald Trump sweeping power to enact his legislative agenda. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, fears the pound could head lower\u2026. President Trump\u2019s clean sweep at last week\u2019s election has been confirmed with the Republicans winning the House. This was expected; however, it gave the dollar a boost overnight, and GBP/USD sunk below $1.27. If we don\u2019t see a stabilization in the pound, then it opens the door to a further decline to $1.25. There were some concerns that winning the trifecta of elections could give President elect Trump concentrated power, however, his choice of John Thune for Senate majority leader is interesting \u2013 he has clashed with Trump before and was not Elon Musk\u2019s choice for the role. This suggests two things: firstly, that the Trump administration could surprise us. Secondly, that although Republicans now control the main organs of power in the US, the President elect may not get his way on all matters. The question is whether this appointment will halt the Trump trade, stocks are pointing to a lower open in the US, although the dollar remains upbeat. Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, predicts a \u201cfull-blown dollar tsunami\u2019 once Trump is back in the White House: Investors are caught in a whirlwind of global uncertainty and trade anxieties. With Trump\u2019s anticipated tariffs looming like storm clouds, those markets in the line of tariff fire are bracing for impact. I hope you\u2019re not underestimating what\u2019s brewing because Trump\u2019s trade and domestic agenda is setting up a US dollar moonshot like we\u2019ve never seen. This week\u2019s price action? Just a tremor before the full-blown dollar tsunami that\u2019s bound to hit with Trump\u2019s second term. In other energy news, the International Energy Agency has predicted that the oil market will run a surplus next year. In its latest monthly report, the IEA says that concerns about the health of the global economy have hit the oil price in recent weeks, with Chinese demand contracting for a sixth straight month in September. It predicts that the oil market will be \u201cwell-supplied\u201d in 2025; the IEA estimates that oil consumption will rise by 990,000 barrels per day next year, while non-OPEC+ supply is expected to grow by 1.5m barrels per day in 2025. As a result, even if the Opec+ group continues to postpone its planned production increase, the IEA reckons supply will outpace demand. It says: Our current balances suggest that even if the OPEC+ cuts remain in place, global supply exceeds demand by more than 1 mb/d next year. With supply risks omnipresent, a looser balance would provide some much-needed stability to a market upended by the Covid pandemic, Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and, most recently, heightened unrest in the Middle East. UK and European gas prices have risen to their highest levels in a year. The European gas benchmark has risen by 4.5% this morning to \u20ac45.65 per megawatt hour, the highest since November 2023. The price of next-day gas in the UK is also trading at its highest since last November, up 4% to 115p per therm. The increase comes as colder weather in Europe drive up demand for heating. Low wind speeds have also caused a \u201cdunkelflaute\u201d in the region, meaning less power could be generated by wind farms. A drop in supplies from Russia is also a factor. Bloomberg is reporting that Russia\u2019s Arctic LNG 2 project has slashed output at its gas fields to nearly zero so far this month, due to western sanctions. And\u2026.Germany has warned its state-operated gas import terminals to reject any Russian cargoes of liquefied natural gas, after it was notified of a planned shipment, the Financial Times reports this morning. According to the FT, the German economy ministry has instructed Deutsche Energy Terminal \u201cnot to accept any deliveries of Russian LNG\u201d. A third possible factor is that Austrian oil and gas group OMV has been awarded \u20ac230m by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) over irregular German gas supplies from Russia\u2019s Gazprom. OMV plans to offset the claim against its bills to Gazprom Export to obtain its compensation, but there are concerns that Gazprom could potentially stop supplies to Austria in response. Austrian energy minister Leonore Gewessler wrote in a post on X yesterday: The current developments surrounding the OMV supply contract for Russian gas are to be taken seriously, but do not pose an immediate threat to our security of supply. We have always known that gas supplies from Russia are unsafe. \u201cWe have been preparing for a possible supply disruption for a long time. In any case, our country\u2019s gas supply is secure. Our gas storage facilities are full.\u201d Tracy Blackwell, chief executive of Pension Insurance Corporation, has backed Rachel Reeves\u2019s pension reforms as \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d. Blackwell told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that new pension \u201cmegafunds\u201d will benefit the taxpayer. We think it\u2019s a really important step in the right direction. It really mirrors what has already happened in the defined benefit private sector world. We can use our economies of scale and expertise to invest in complex projects in the UK. It doesn\u2019t solve all the issues but it is very much a step in the right direction. Shares in Burberry have jumped 6% at the start of trading in London, as traders react to its turnaround plan. Pub chain Young &amp; Co has reported that last month\u2019s budget will drive up its costs by \u00a311m a year. Simon Dodd, chief executive of Young\u2019s, told shareholders that measures such as the increase in employers\u2019 national insurance contributions will be costly: The new government\u2019s budget will result in significant increased costs for our industry in the near term through rises in National Minimum Wage and Employer\u2019s NI payments. We expect the cost impact to be approximately \u00a311m on an annualised basis from next April. We will work to see how we can mitigate these headwinds without passing on all the cost to our loyal customers. Luxury fashion group Burberry has announced a turnaround plan that aims to revitalise its sales and cut costs. Burberry\u2019s new CEO, Joshua Schulman, told the City this morning that his \u2018Burberry Forward\u2019 plan will \u201creignite brand desire\u201d, improve performance and drive long-term value creation. Schulman says he is aiming to attract a broad base of luxury customers, and criticises his predecessors for moving \u201ctoo far from our core with disappointing results,\u201d by trying to be modern rather than focusing on the firm\u2019s traditional strengths. Schulman explains: We recognise there is much to be done in the short term, and we are acting with urgency. We are confident we can get back to generating \u00a33 billion in annual revenue over time, while rebuilding margins and driving strong cash generation. Burberry is also launching a cost savings programme to save \u00a340m per year, and also suspending its dividend. Burberry has also reported that revenues fell 22% year-on-year in the six months to the end of September, meaning it made a loss of. \u00a353m, down from a profit of \u00a3223m the previous year. Rachel Reeves has told the Financial Times that her plans will create eight pension \u201cmegafunds\u201d. She has told the Financial Times that these eight pools, worth an average \u00a350bn by 2030, would end the role of local councils in administering the money and boost \u201cfast-growing British businesses and infrastructure\u201d. Reeves told the FT: Everything will go through the pools rather than through local authorities. This will deliver the megafunds that have eluded the UK for too long. Amanda Blanc DBE, chief executive officer at Aviva, reckon\u2019s Reeves\u2019s shake-up will benefit savers, saying: \u201cAs the UK\u2019s largest pension provider, we warmly welcome today\u2019s announcement. These proposals will help get more savers into larger schemes that can offer better value and more opportunities for productive investment\u201d. The IPPR thinktank is hopeful that combining the UK\u2019s 86 separate local government pension schemes into a single pot will help drive investment. Dr George Dibb, associate director for economic policy at IPPR, says: With the lowest levels of investment in the G7 \u2014 and among the lowest in the developed world \u2014 the UK has languished at the bottom of the league for 24 of the past 30 years. These pension fund reforms should help to end that. Consolidating pension pots into \u2018megafunds\u2019 will unlock substantial capital for UK investment, enabling more high-impact, high-return ventures. Paired with a comprehensive industrial strategy and the highest levels of public investment since the 1970s, these reforms will help shift the UK economy toward sustained investment and growth. Former Bank of England economist Neil Record is concerned that Rachel Reeves\u2019s plan to create pension megafunds could leave taxpayers were \u201con the hook if investments went wrong\u201d, the Daily Telegraph reports. Record says: This is not the case in the private pension market, where the number and size of failed pension funds now in the Pension Protection Fund illustrates how hard it is to get investments sufficiently right to pay the pensions promised. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is to lay out plans today to create pension \u201cmegafunds\u201d in a drive to to increase infrastructure investment. Reeves will tell the City tonight that she will introduce a new pensions bill next year, to pool assets from the 86 separate local government pension schemes (LGPS) into larger vehicles. Those 86 defined-benefit schemes cover 6.5 million members and \u00a3360bn in assets. Putting them into larger pots would create a set-up similar to those in Australia and Canada, where single large pension funds managed by professional investors invest more in infrastructure The chancellor will tell an audience of City leaders and chief executives at the Mansion House tonight that the plan could unlock \u00a380bn of investment. Reeves says: Last month\u2019s Budget fixed the foundations to restore economic stability and put our public services on a firmer footing. Now we\u2019re going for growth. That starts with the biggest set of reforms to the pensions market in decades to unlock tens of billions of pounds of investment in business and infrastructure, boost people\u2019s savings in retirement and drive economic growth so we can make every part of Britain better off. But\u2026 there are concerns that the plan could put people\u2019s retirement savings in danger. Tom Selby, director of public policy at AJ Bell, fears that the interests of savers may be left behind as ambitious measures could put savers\u2019 money at risk and undermine their retirement goals. Selby says: The government\u2019s hope will be that by moving from having 86 local government schemes down to a single one, or a few, will benefit from economies of scale. My overarching concern is that the needs of the saver, whose money is ultimately going to be risked, will be forgotten about. There\u2019s a reason that an occupational scheme has a trustee to look after the interests of members. Part of that is investing their money to maximise returns and get the best retirement outcomes possible. Selby adds: Conflating a government goal of driving investment in the UK and people\u2019s retirement outcomes brings a danger because the risks are all taken with members\u2019 money. If it goes well, everyone can celebrate. But it\u2019s clearly possible that it will go the other way, so there needs to be some caution in this push to use other people\u2019s money to drive economic growth. It needs to be made very clear to members what is happening with their money. One of the strengths of the system we have today is that investment decisions for members of defined contribution (DC) default funds and defined benefit (DB) schemes have independence baked in, usually via the appointment of trustees. Those trustees are required to make those decisions first-and-foremost with the aim of delivering the highest possible income in retirement for members. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. UK tenants are facing a \u201cchasm\u201d when trying to find a property to rent, surveyors are warning today, as demand rises and the supply of rental properties falls. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) has reported that renters are being squeezed by lower supply and rising prices in the lettings market. A net balance of +19% of surveyors polled reported that tenant demand in their area increased over the last three months. At the same time, landlord instructions, which measures how many landlords are making their property available for rent, fell over the quarter. RICS\u2019s UK Residential Market Survey found that a net balance of +33% of respondents expects rental prices to be driven higher over the coming three months, due to this mismatch between supply and demand. RICS says that \u201cwoes for renters persist\u201d as rental properties continue to disappear from the market and demand remains resilient in most regions. RICS president, Tina Paillet, said: Our data continues to indicate that renters are feeling the pressure from a limited supply of rental properties and rising rents. While the Autumn Budget announcement of immediate stamp duty increases for landlords acquiring rental properties may increase opportunities in supply for owner-occupiers, it will make it more challenging to address the critical shortage of rental homes. RICS\u2019s latest monthly survey also found that UK house prices continued to rise in October, although they did drop in Yorkshire and the Humber, and the South West of England. More surveyors expect prices to rise over the next year than to fall. RICS says: Virtually all parts of the UK are expected to see a rise in house prices in the year to come, led by firm growth across Northern Ireland and Scotland.

In the town of Paiporta \u2013 which was the scene of angry protests during a visit by the king and queen, the prime minister and the regional president of Valencia five days after the disaster \u2013 the death toll was 45. In the nearby municipality of Catarroja, it was 25; in Valencia city, 16; in Alfafar, 15; in Massanassa, 11 and in Benet\u00fasser, Torrent and Picanya, it was 10. Elsewhere, in towns such as Utiel and Chiva, the death toll was fewer than 10 people. Residents of Utiel, including the mayor, had previously said that those who died were older people, or those with mobility problems, who had drowned in their own homes. Fears of another devastating flood in Valencia rose once again after Spain\u2019s state meteorological office, Aemet, issued another red weather alert for the region on Wednesday night. But the area was spared a repetition of the disaster and the worst of Wednesday\u2019s flooding hit M\u00e1laga in Andaluc\u00eda, prompting the evacuation of thousands of people from riverside neighbourhoods. Growing public anger over the authorities\u2019 handling of the natural disaster led 130,000 people to take to the streets of Valencia last Saturday to demand the resignation of the region\u2019s president, Carlos Maz\u00f3n. Maz\u00f3n, a member of the conservative People\u2019s party (PP), is under mounting pressure after it emerged he had a three-hour lunch with a journalist on 29 October, the day the torrential rains lashed the region, and did not arrive at the emergency command centre until 7.30pm that evening. Much of the anger also stems from the fact that Maz\u00f3n\u2019s administration waited almost 14 hours before sending emergency civil protection messages to people\u2019s mobile phones on 29 October, despite the series of weather warnings issued by Aemet early that morning and the previous evening. Maz\u00f3n himself has tried to blame Spain\u2019s socialist-led government, and even the armed forces\u2019 military emergencies unit (UME), whose personnel have been deployed to the region in huge numbers. He is due to offer an account of the disaster to regional MPs on Friday.",

The man then steps back, lights a device, and throws it towards the court building, but it does not appear to explode. He lights another one and throws it, resulting in an explosion under the building\u2019s awning.</p> <p>The man then kneels, lights a third device, lies down, places the bomb under his head, and it detonates.</p>    <p>The explosions took place around the Three Powers Plaza, a square in Bras\u00edlia connecting the principal buildings of Brazil\u2019s three branches of the federal government: the supreme court, the Congress and the presidential palace. </p> <p>The president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, was not in the palace at the time of the explosions, a spokesperson said. </p> <p>On his social media, Luiz had frequently attacked the supreme court and \u201ccommunists\u201d, often posting images of himself with Brazil\u2019s flag and wearing the national football team shirt \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/brazil-world-cup-shirt-colours\">symbols embraced by the far right in recent years</a>.</p> <p>Moments before the attack, he posted on Facebook: \u201cShall we play? Federal Police, you have 72 hours to defuse the bomb at the house of those communist scum.\u201d</p> <p>He ran for city council in 2020 for Bolsonaro\u2019s current party.</p> <p><a href=\"https://x.com/jairbolsonaro/status/1857031232204288321\">In a post on X</a>, Bolsonaro wrote: \u201cI regret and condemn any act of violence, like the tragic episode yesterday at the Plaza of the Three Powers,\u201d stating that it was an \u201cisolated incident, and, from what appears, caused by mental health issues of the person who, unfortunately, ended up passing away\u201d.</p>    <p>This is not the first attempt at a bomb attack in Brazil\u2019s capital.

      "bodyText": "The main target of a bomber who killed himself while attempting to attack Brazil\u2019s supreme court was the justice leading the key investigations into the attempted coup of 8 January last year, when supporters of the former president Jair Bolsonaro ransacked the buildings to protest against his election defeat, police have said. The explosions outside the court on Wednesday took place just five days before the G20 heads of state are due to meet in Rio de Janeiro, which will be followed by a state visit to Bras\u00edlia, the capital, by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. Police identified the bomber as Francisco Wanderley Luiz, a 59-year-old locksmith from the southern state of Santa Catarina, where he had run for city council in Rio do Sol in 2020, receiving only 98 votes. The federal police director general, Andrei Rodrigues, said on Thursday that the failed attack was being investigated as a \u201cterrorist act\u201d and that the main target was believed to be Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing investigations into the 2023 attempted coup and crimes attributed to Bolsonaro. Moraes is also known for his public clash with Elon Musk after suspending the social media platform X in Brazil for its refusal to suspend accounts accused of promoting hate speech and anti-democratic content. Rodrigues said Luiz\u2019s ex-wife said her ex-husband had told her that he would kill \u201cMoraes and anyone else who was with him at the time\u201d. The director general said her testimony was \u201cvery clear\u201d in identifying the judge as the target, but there were \u201cother social media messages, including ones sent [by Luiz] to the court itself, threatening the entire tribunal\u201d. He added that these threats highlight the seriousness of the attack, which he said must be treated \u201cas a terrorist act and a violent action aimed at bringing down the rule of law\u201d. Earlier, Moraes had said the explosions could not be treated as an \u201cisolated incident\u201d but rather as something that started \u201cback when the \u2018hate cabinet\u2019 [as the pro-Bolsonaro mobs became known] began to spread hate speech against institutions, against the supreme court\u201d. The justice also criticised a proposed amnesty for those convicted of the attempted coup, which pro-Bolsonaro congress officials are trying to pass in congress. \u201cThere is no possibility of peace with an amnesty for criminals \u2026 impunity will generate more aggression, as it did yesterday,\u201d said Moraes. The first of two explosions went off at about 7.30pm local time (2230 GMT) on Wednesday evening in a car park near the court building and a second blast came seconds later in front of the court, where Luiz\u2019s body was found. Security camera footage released by the TV network GloboNews showed a man walking up to a statue in the courtyard in front of the court and throwing an object at the statue. He is then approached by a guard. The man then steps back, lights a device, and throws it towards the court building, but it does not appear to explode. He lights another one and throws it, resulting in an explosion under the building\u2019s awning. The man then kneels, lights a third device, lies down, places the bomb under his head, and it detonates. The explosions took place around the Three Powers Plaza, a square in Bras\u00edlia connecting the principal buildings of Brazil\u2019s three branches of the federal government: the supreme court, the Congress and the presidential palace. The president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, was not in the palace at the time of the explosions, a spokesperson said. On his social media, Luiz had frequently attacked the supreme court and \u201ccommunists\u201d, often posting images of himself with Brazil\u2019s flag and wearing the national football team shirt \u2013 symbols embraced by the far right in recent years. Moments before the attack, he posted on Facebook: \u201cShall we play? Federal Police, you have 72 hours to defuse the bomb at the house of those communist scum.\u201d He ran for city council in 2020 for Bolsonaro\u2019s current party. In a post on X, Bolsonaro wrote: \u201cI regret and condemn any act of violence, like the tragic episode yesterday at the Plaza of the Three Powers,\u201d stating that it was an \u201cisolated incident, and, from what appears, caused by mental health issues of the person who, unfortunately, ended up passing away\u201d. This is not the first attempt at a bomb attack in Brazil\u2019s capital. On 24 December 2022 \u2013 just days before the riots \u2013 police discovered and defused an explosive device in a truck loaded with aviation fuel near Bras\u00edlia\u2019s international airport. Three Bolsonaro supporters were identified and convicted. One of them admitted that the goal was to prevent Lula\u2019s inauguration. It is still unclear whether Luiz acted alone or had assistance. He is believed to have been living in a town near Bras\u00edlia since July, and explosives were also found at the house where he had been staying. Police deployed a bomb squad with an explosive disposal robot to the square to investigate the blasts. According to the police, there was a belt with unactivated explosives on Luiz\u2019s body, along with a detonator. In total, the police said, six explosive devices were deactivated in the Plaza area.",

The closure was officially put down to alleged violations of fire safety regulations but comes amid an intense campaign by Russian officials against independent civil society and those who question the state\u2019s interpretation of history. Established in 2001, the central museum brings together a vast collection of official state documents with family photographs and objects from gulag victims. The Council of Europe awarded the site its museum prize in 2021, saying it worked to \u201cexpose history and activate memory, with the goal of strengthening the resilience of civil society and its resistance to political repression and violation of human rights today and in the future\u201d.

He was born in Belgium to English parents and educated at a French language school, Ligue 1 is his natural habitat. Finding others to follow Rosenior\u2019s riskier path is where Britain is struggling.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s great from a football experience and life experience to do it,\u201d says Paul Clement, who worked as an assistant at Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich under Carlo Ancelotti before becoming head coach at Cercle Brugge. \u201cThe way things are with competition for the jobs and the attraction of the jobs in England, then you\u2019ve got to widen the pool of employment opportunities.\u201d</p> <p>Graham Potter is often seen as the poster boy when it comes to leaving your comfort zone to educate yourself as a coach. The former Southampton defender took \u00d6stersund from the Swedish fourth division up through the leagues and into Europe. By moving to Scandinavia, Potter was afforded more time to hone his skills as a tactician and man-manager, helping him to create a philosophy and plan that was successfully implemented at Swansea and Brighton.</p> <p>There is a vast amount of data available regardless of where in the world someone is employed; a coach\u2019s success can be tracked and a body of work created. Often there are fewer games abroad, giving coaches more days on the training pitch with their players, allowing them more time to hone a style that is transferable to jobs throughout their career. Sporting directors are looking for evidence of progress under someone\u2019s tutelage, as Potter demonstrated from a small town in Sweden.</p>    <p>It is perceived in Europe that British coaching has stagnated and remains in a football cocoon where the emphasis is on playing 4-4-2 and focus on getting crosses into the box. \u201cI don\u2019t remember ever having a conversation with anyone that said English coaches are really strong or good,\u201d Clement says. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t good English coaches because absolutely there are. But in general, the reputation on the continent is not good for English coaches.\u201d</p> <p>Owners like to see evidence that a person has experience of dealing with a multitude of nationalities but language can be a barrier and endeavouring to learn a new one puts many off flying the nest. Terry Venables always had his trusted translator by his side at Barcelona and other clubs, such as Sparta Prague, have English as the first language on the training ground despite having no native speakers. When there is not a common tongue, however, learning how to get a message across without words is a useful tool and helps grow communication skills.</p> <p>\u201cThe challenge of moving does scare some coaches, the issue with communication and getting out of your comfort zone. I\u2019m so glad that I did it. Coaching in a second language is very challenging but beneficial,\u201d Clement says. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in Spain, Germany, Belgium, England and France, building relationships with players has become better. Having had those experiences, sharing knowledge, sharing information, sharing experiences that you\u2019ve had is definitely a positive thing.\u201d</p> <p>Brexit, admittedly, has made matters more problematic. Just ask Stockport\u2019s Andy Mangan who was not allowed to join <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/sep/10/stockport-coach-andy-mangan-real-madrid-football\">the coaching staff at Real Madrid</a> although Borussia Dortmund have Alex Clapham and Aaron Danks is at Bayern Munich. It is imperative for those in the industry to find pathways to help coaches reach the continent amid the fallout from leaving the European Union or risk the isles becoming more isolated.</p> <p>Steve Bould is the head coach at the Belgian second-tier club Lommel, with the former England Under-18s manager Ryan Garry his assistant. They are both in the City Football Group framework that has helped Des Buckingham and Liam Manning thrive after spells in India and Belgium where they were exposed to different methodologies, lifestyles and circumstances. Neither enjoyed professional playing careers of note, starting coaching at relatively young ages, quickly heading abroad to test themselves and build impressive CVs.</p>    <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got no hesitation to go abroad again and would actually relish that experience and want that experience again,\u201d Clement says. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself as an English coach, I see myself as an international coach having had that experience.\u201d</p> <p>There is no singular defined path to the top \u2013 or even mediocrity \u2013 but it feels like Britain is being left behind. Where once coaches brought revolution to other countries, they are now playing catch-up. Badges and a pro licence will only get a person so far; sometimes they need to add risk in order to get reward.</p>",

Sporting directors are looking for evidence of progress under someone\u2019s tutelage, as Potter demonstrated from a small town in Sweden. It is perceived in Europe that British coaching has stagnated and remains in a football cocoon where the emphasis is on playing 4-4-2 and focus on getting crosses into the box. \u201cI don\u2019t remember ever having a conversation with anyone that said English coaches are really strong or good,\u201d Clement says. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t good English coaches because absolutely there are. But in general, the reputation on the continent is not good for English coaches.\u201d Owners like to see evidence that a person has experience of dealing with a multitude of nationalities but language can be a barrier and endeavouring to learn a new one puts many off flying the nest. Terry Venables always had his trusted translator by his side at Barcelona and other clubs, such as Sparta Prague, have English as the first language on the training ground despite having no native speakers. When there is not a common tongue, however, learning how to get a message across without words is a useful tool and helps grow communication skills. \u201cThe challenge of moving does scare some coaches, the issue with communication and getting out of your comfort zone. I\u2019m so glad that I did it. Coaching in a second language is very challenging but beneficial,\u201d Clement says. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in Spain, Germany, Belgium, England and France, building relationships with players has become better. Having had those experiences, sharing knowledge, sharing information, sharing experiences that you\u2019ve had is definitely a positive thing.\u201d Brexit, admittedly, has made matters more problematic. Just ask Stockport\u2019s Andy Mangan who was not allowed to join the coaching staff at Real Madrid although Borussia Dortmund have Alex Clapham and Aaron Danks is at Bayern Munich. It is imperative for those in the industry to find pathways to help coaches reach the continent amid the fallout from leaving the European Union or risk the isles becoming more isolated. Steve Bould is the head coach at the Belgian second-tier club Lommel, with the former England Under-18s manager Ryan Garry his assistant. They are both in the City Football Group framework that has helped Des Buckingham and Liam Manning thrive after spells in India and Belgium where they were exposed to different methodologies, lifestyles and circumstances. Neither enjoyed professional playing careers of note, starting coaching at relatively young ages, quickly heading abroad to test themselves and build impressive CVs. \u201cI\u2019ve got no hesitation to go abroad again and would actually relish that experience and want that experience again,\u201d Clement says. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself as an English coach, I see myself as an international coach having had that experience.\u201d There is no singular defined path to the top \u2013 or even mediocrity \u2013 but it feels like Britain is being left behind. Where once coaches brought revolution to other countries, they are now playing catch-up. Badges and a pro licence will only get a person so far; sometimes they need to add risk in order to get reward.",

When you hear that, it really makes you wonder: did he bring enough drugs to share? Because I could really use them right about now.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also named Tulsi Gabbard director of national intelligence. Colbert, who interviewed Gabbard during her 2020 presidential run, said: \u201cWhen I think Tulsi Gabbard, the word \u2018intelligence\u2019 is not the first one that comes to mind. Or the second.\u201d</p> <p>Gabbard has spread Russian propaganda on fringe far-right sites, to the point that Hillary Clinton said Russia was \u201cgrooming\u201d her. \u201cBut only because she\u2019s too old to be groomed by Matt Gaetz,\u201d Colbert quipped.</p> <h2><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiNV3yhZ5EI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IiNV3yhZ5EI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>And in Los Angeles, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/jimmy-kimmel\">Jimmy Kimmel</a> recapped Trump\u2019s meeting with Biden. \u201cIt was so weird seeing Trump back in the White House,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like if there was a sequel to Snakes on a Plane, but this time the plane was all snakes.\u201d</p> <p>Biden and Trump met for about two hours, with each promising reporters a \u201csmooth\u201d transition. \u201cJust me, or did that sound like two guys talking about their bowel movements there?\u201d Kimmel wondered.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you see Donald Trump sitting in front of a portrait of George Washington, you realize how ridiculous this whole thing is,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Kimmel also touched on some of Trump\u2019s administration picks, including Gabbard for director of national intelligence, \u201cwhich is a big job\u201d, he said. \u201cIt could interfere with her other job, working for Russian national intelligence.\u201d</p> <p>And he had special ire for Gaetz, who remains under investigation for the alleged sex trafficking of a minor. \u201cYou know, at a lot of jobs, being investigated for sex-trafficking underage girls would hurt your chance for advancement,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the Trump administration, you can list it on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 under \u2018special skills\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cWhat a team he\u2019s putting together,\u201d he concluded. \u201cIt\u2019s the legion of dumb.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Late-night hosts discussed Joe Biden\u2019s meeting with Donald Trump and Trump\u2019s announcement of Matt Gaetz as attorney general and Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense. Seth Meyers Barely a week after the election, Joe Biden met with President-elect Donald Trump in the White House, where both men appeared confused before reporters. \u201cI believe the one thing these two old-ass dudes can agree on is that they can\u2019t understand a word you\u2019re saying,\u201d laughed Seth Meyers on Wednesday\u2019s Late Night. \u201cThe press is treating this like the Beatles landing at JFK but to them, it sounds like a plane taking off at JFK.\u201d Trump \u201cattempted to be normal, but still made it a little weird\u201d, said Meyers. The president-elect, seated next to Biden, told the press: \u201cPolitics is tough and it is in many cases not a nice world but it is a nice world today and I appreciate it very much.\u201d \u201cIt is unnerving watching Trump try to behave,\u201d said Meyers. \u201cIt\u2019s like watching the neighborhood bulldog who\u2019s always terrorizing mailmen mope around with a surgery cone.\u201d For his part, Biden promised Trump that his administration would \u201cdo everything we can\u201d to accommodate the transition of power. \u201cOr don\u2019t!\u201d Meyers suggested. \u201cI mean, you correctly called him a criminal fascist and threat to democracy. I\u2019m not saying booby-trap the place, but you don\u2019t have to be overly helpful. I mean, how are you going to accommodate him, anyway? Update all the toilets so they can handle more classified documents? Restock the fridge in Stephen Miller\u2019s office with mice?\u201d Meanwhile, Trump has announced a \u201cPandora\u2019s cabinet of goblins and weirdos\u201d and is going to \u201cstick them on the government like a bunch of ferrets on ketamine\u201d, Meyers lamented. This includes the Fox News host Pete Hegseth, a former army national guard member who is Trump\u2019s pick for secretary of defense. To summarize Hegseth\u2019s qualifications, Meyers played a 2015 video of Hegseth throwing an axe outside Fox studios, clearing the target and accidentally hitting a civilian. \u201cWhy are you throwing an axe near people in midtown Manhattan?!\u201d Meyers exclaimed. \u201cSaying yes to that takes the same kind of unearned confidence it takes to say yes to being secretary of defense with zero government experience.\u201d Stephen Colbert Eight days since the election, \u201cI\u2019ve been saying, quite sincerely, hey, let\u2019s not get out over our skis here,\u201d said Stephen Colbert on The Late Show. \u201cLet\u2019s take this one day at a time. Maybe, maybe, betting against all logic and previous experience, it will be different this time. \u201cI was right. Because it\u2019s already way worse,\u201d he continued, especially as Trump announced on Truth Social that he was nominating Matt Gaetz to be attorney general of the United States. \u201cDuring the campaign, I thought if Trump won, he would do the worst things I could imagine,\u201d said Colbert. \u201cTurns out, I don\u2019t have much of an imagination. There is not enough Botox in the world to hide how shocked I am. There is also not enough Botox in the world because Matt Gaetz used all of it. \u201cWhat a horrifying idea this is,\u201d he added. \u201cMatt Gaetz, nominated for the top law enforcement office in the United States, is currently under investigation by a House ethics panel that issued a subpoena for him in a sex and drugs probe. When you hear that, it really makes you wonder: did he bring enough drugs to share? Because I could really use them right about now.\u201d Trump also named Tulsi Gabbard director of national intelligence. Colbert, who interviewed Gabbard during her 2020 presidential run, said: \u201cWhen I think Tulsi Gabbard, the word \u2018intelligence\u2019 is not the first one that comes to mind. Or the second.\u201d Gabbard has spread Russian propaganda on fringe far-right sites, to the point that Hillary Clinton said Russia was \u201cgrooming\u201d her. \u201cBut only because she\u2019s too old to be groomed by Matt Gaetz,\u201d Colbert quipped. Jimmy Kimmel And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel recapped Trump\u2019s meeting with Biden. \u201cIt was so weird seeing Trump back in the White House,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like if there was a sequel to Snakes on a Plane, but this time the plane was all snakes.\u201d Biden and Trump met for about two hours, with each promising reporters a \u201csmooth\u201d transition. \u201cJust me, or did that sound like two guys talking about their bowel movements there?\u201d Kimmel wondered. \u201cWhen you see Donald Trump sitting in front of a portrait of George Washington, you realize how ridiculous this whole thing is,\u201d he added. Kimmel also touched on some of Trump\u2019s administration picks, including Gabbard for director of national intelligence, \u201cwhich is a big job\u201d, he said. \u201cIt could interfere with her other job, working for Russian national intelligence.\u201d And he had special ire for Gaetz, who remains under investigation for the alleged sex trafficking of a minor. \u201cYou know, at a lot of jobs, being investigated for sex-trafficking underage girls would hurt your chance for advancement,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the Trump administration, you can list it on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 under \u2018special skills\u2019. \u201cWhat a team he\u2019s putting together,\u201d he concluded. \u201cIt\u2019s the legion of dumb.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Rachel Reeves has announced plans to merge local government retirement schemes into eight Canada-style \u201cmegafunds\u201d in what the Treasury claims will be part of the biggest reform of the UK pension market in decades. So what will the changes, announced as part of the chancellor\u2019s inaugural Mansion House speech on Thursday, actually mean for UK pensions and what can they achieve? What is Reeves planning? The chancellor plans to introduce a new pensions bill next year that will aim to pool assets from 86 separate local government pension schemes (LGPS) in England and Wales into eight \u201cmegafunds\u201d, worth an average of \u00a350bn each, by 2030. Reeves is also planning to consolidate smaller defined contribution schemes across the UK from private businesses into pools of \u00a325bn to \u00a350bn. There have long been questions over how to handle the UK\u2019s fragmented pension landscape, including the assets of the LGPS, which together represent one of the world\u2019s largest defined-benefit schemes with 6.5 million members and \u00a3360bn in assets. The LGPS are the gold plated pensions of local government workers in England and Wales, which offer secure income for retirees, including final salaries of pensioners who joined before 2014 and a career-average salary scheme to those who came in after. What is the point of these \u2018megafunds\u2019? The government is aiming to emulate the pension success stories of countries such as Australia, Canada and Norway, where public sector pension schemes have been consolidated into larger funds that are managed in-house by professional investors. The idea is that bigger retirement funds can invest larger sums of money into a wider range of riskier and long-term assets such as infrastructure, startups and direct stakes in private businesses, known as private equity. While the government has not mandated where the pooled retirement money would go, the hope is a large portion would naturally flow into the UK\u2019s own growing businesses and infrastructure projects. Pooling assets would help cut costs, slashing the fees paid to teams of lawyers, banks, advisers, asset managers and actuaries deployed to help individual funds each year.

Foreign \u201cmegafunds\u201d such as the Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan and British Columbia Investment Management Corporation have invested in portions of the UK\u2019s gas network, while others have taken stakes in UK ports, offices, shopping centres and other utilities. Overnight, the news broke that PSP Investments \u2013 which manages the retirement funds for the Canadian armed forces and Royal Canadian Mounted Police \u2013 had bought the operator of Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton airports from Ferrovial and Macquarie in a \u00a31.5bn deal.

No. Reeves \u2013 who hinted at this plan when she met pension bosses in Toronto this summer \u2013 is in effect rehashing similar plans by previous governments. One of the most serious attempts came nearly a decade ago in 2015, when the then prime minister, David Cameron, pushed local government pension scheme funds into larger pools, with the intention of cutting investment costs and allowing for collective investment in assets such as infrastructure.

What challenges could Reeves face? There is the risk that Reeves could face bureaucratic battles with local councillors, including those from her own party, who do not want to give up control of how their pension money is invested. The Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association has cautioned about the potential tax and legal costs that could be involved in transferring the assets into larger pools, which is an issue that ended up hindering the consolidation process launched under Cameron. There could also be pushback from the reams of lawyers, asset managers, banks and actuaries who could lose out on hundreds of millions of pounds in annual fees and contracts if funds are consolidated.

      "bodyText": "France must investigate the use of its military systems by Sudan\u2019s paramilitary forces, which could be in breach of an arms embargo, Amnesty International has said. The group said it had identified the French-made Galix defence system being used in Sudan on armoured vehicles manufactured in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) \u2013 considered a key supplier of weapons to the Rapid Support Force (RSF). While France can legally export weapons to the UAE, Amnesty said the government and French arms companies had a duty to monitor whether the Galix system was then being illegally exported to Sudan after being affixed to the UAE-produced Nimr Ajban vehicles. War between the RSF and the Sudanese government forces (SAF) has raged since April 2023, killing tens of thousands and displacing 11 million. The UN has called for external backers to stop supplying weapons to both sides. A UN embargo in place since 2004 bans all weapons transfers to the region of Darfur, where the Janjaweed militias that were formalised into the RSF were accused of genocide, and the EU also has a ban on weapons transfers to all of Sudan. The UAE has been accused of violating the embargo by supplying the RSF with arms and its own forces. Agn\u00e8s Callamard, Amnesty International\u2019s secretary general, said the French government should stop the companies Lacroix Defense and KNDS France supplying the UAE. Neither company responded to requests for comment. \u201cThe Galix System is being deployed by the RSF in this conflict, and any use in Darfur would be a clear breach of the UN arms embargo,\u201d said Callamard. \u201cAmnesty International has already shown how the constant flow of arms into Sudan is causing immense human suffering. \u201cAll countries must immediately cease direct and indirect supplies of all arms and ammunition to the warring parties. They must respect and enforce the UN security council\u2019s arms embargo regime on Darfur before even more civilian lives are lost.\u201d Galix helps vehicle sensors detect close-range threats and shield from attack by deploying projectiles, smoke and decoys. Amnesty said it had identified the system on vehicles destroyed or seized by Sudanese government forces. The RSF control almost all of Darfur\u2019s major cities, and stand accused of ethnic cleansing, sexual violence, looting and arson. \u201cRosemary DiCarlo, UN under secretary general for political affairs, on Tuesday said: \u201cThe SAF and the RSF both think they can win the war in Sudan, escalating operations, recruiting new fighters and intensifying attacks. Some of their external backers, who provide weapons and other support, are enabling the slaughter. This must stop.\u201d The US government-backed Conflict Observatory reported in October that transfers of weapons by the UAE to Darfur via Chad and by Iran to the SAF had been documented.

      "body": "<p>Whatever else South Africa are expecting from England, it\u2019s not a surprise. The Springboks head coach, Rassie Erasmus, says they picked the team three weeks ago, during a training camp in Jersey. Nothing he\u2019s seen in the way England played against New Zealand and Australia seems to have changed his mind. If anything, the two defeats only confirmed what he already suspected.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, when you lose two games, even if it\u2019s by a point or last-minute try, the pressure does start to build,\u201d Erasmus said. \u201cI\u2019ve been there. I certainly know how quickly it can get to you. And when that happens you normally fall back on to what works for you.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/14/freddie-steward-england-four-changes-south-africa-test-rugby-union-autumn-nations-series\">Freddie Steward recalled as England make four changes for South Africa Test</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Which is why Erasmus believes England will revert to the same sort of gameplan they used in the World Cup semi-final last year. \u201cWe very much expect them to try to squeeze us with the kicking game.\u201d He stopped short of naming Steve Borthwick\u2019s team for him, the way he did before that World Cup match, but he did predict, with utmost confidence, that Borthwick would \u201cdefinitely\u201d pick Freddie Steward at full-back. Two hours later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/14/freddie-steward-england-four-changes-south-africa-test-rugby-union-autumn-nations-series\">Borthwick proved him right</a>. England\u2019s coach must feel like he\u2019s been playing poker with a mirror over his shoulder.</p> <p>South Africa have made 12 changes to the team that beat Scotland, including the entire backline. The only players who will start both games are the prop Ox Nch\u00e9, hooker Bongi Mbonambi and lock Eben Etzebeth. England will have been anticipating most of the switches given that South Africa are on a six-day turnaround, but there are still a couple they won\u2019t have seen coming among them. Erasmus has picked Manie Libbok at fly-half, even though he allowed him to play only the first half-hour of that semi-final, and he has recalled Wilco Louw at tighthead.</p> <p>Erasmus has also picked a five-three split on the bench, instead of stacking it with six or seven forwards. It\u2019s the same arrangement he used in the semi-final, too. \u201cEngland is the only team that does not have a six-day turnaround, and our six-day turnaround is in the England week,\u201d Erasmus said. \u201cWe need to make sure we can handle their kicking game, which seems to be something that they really fall back on, and their rush defence, which will certainly have a heavy toll on our backs. That\u2019s why we went with a 5-3 split. And then hopefully our forwards are still fresh because they didn\u2019t all play the full 80 minutes.\u201d</p>    <p>By the time kick-off comes around the backline, Erasmus said, will have spent the last nine days preparing specifically for this match. \u201cLast week after those guys helped the team prepare for Scotland, they turned their heads to England and they started analysing them.\u201d He is clearly still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/oct/21/england-south-africa-rugby-world-cup-2023-semi-final-live\">stewing over that World Cup match</a>, when England came within two points of beating them. He even said the decision to pick Libbok was specifically because \u201cwe like to give a guy a second chance, and it was against England, you know, where we had to make the substitution in the 32nd minute\u201d.</p> <p>Erasmus says that the only real difference he sees between this England team and that one is in their defence. \u201cThe guys tackle, man.

      "bodyText": "Whatever else South Africa are expecting from England, it\u2019s not a surprise. The Springboks head coach, Rassie Erasmus, says they picked the team three weeks ago, during a training camp in Jersey. Nothing he\u2019s seen in the way England played against New Zealand and Australia seems to have changed his mind. If anything, the two defeats only confirmed what he already suspected. \u201cYou know, when you lose two games, even if it\u2019s by a point or last-minute try, the pressure does start to build,\u201d Erasmus said. \u201cI\u2019ve been there. I certainly know how quickly it can get to you. And when that happens you normally fall back on to what works for you.\u201d Which is why Erasmus believes England will revert to the same sort of gameplan they used in the World Cup semi-final last year. \u201cWe very much expect them to try to squeeze us with the kicking game.\u201d He stopped short of naming Steve Borthwick\u2019s team for him, the way he did before that World Cup match, but he did predict, with utmost confidence, that Borthwick would \u201cdefinitely\u201d pick Freddie Steward at full-back. Two hours later, Borthwick proved him right. England\u2019s coach must feel like he\u2019s been playing poker with a mirror over his shoulder. South Africa have made 12 changes to the team that beat Scotland, including the entire backline. The only players who will start both games are the prop Ox Nch\u00e9, hooker Bongi Mbonambi and lock Eben Etzebeth. England will have been anticipating most of the switches given that South Africa are on a six-day turnaround, but there are still a couple they won\u2019t have seen coming among them. Erasmus has picked Manie Libbok at fly-half, even though he allowed him to play only the first half-hour of that semi-final, and he has recalled Wilco Louw at tighthead. Erasmus has also picked a five-three split on the bench, instead of stacking it with six or seven forwards. It\u2019s the same arrangement he used in the semi-final, too. \u201cEngland is the only team that does not have a six-day turnaround, and our six-day turnaround is in the England week,\u201d Erasmus said. \u201cWe need to make sure we can handle their kicking game, which seems to be something that they really fall back on, and their rush defence, which will certainly have a heavy toll on our backs. That\u2019s why we went with a 5-3 split. And then hopefully our forwards are still fresh because they didn\u2019t all play the full 80 minutes.\u201d By the time kick-off comes around the backline, Erasmus said, will have spent the last nine days preparing specifically for this match. \u201cLast week after those guys helped the team prepare for Scotland, they turned their heads to England and they started analysing them.\u201d He is clearly still stewing over that World Cup match, when England came within two points of beating them. He even said the decision to pick Libbok was specifically because \u201cwe like to give a guy a second chance, and it was against England, you know, where we had to make the substitution in the 32nd minute\u201d. Erasmus says that the only real difference he sees between this England team and that one is in their defence. \u201cThe guys tackle, man. They might miss a few, but hell, they make reads and they sometimes make misreads, but they tackle, you know? And that\u2019s a sign of a team that cares a lot.\u201d England\u2019s attack, based around Marcus Smith, didn\u2019t seem to worry him much at all, maybe because Smith\u2019s former Harlequins coach Jerry Flannery is now with the Springboks. The irony is that it ought to be Borthwick who has the inside line on the opposition, given that he hired Erasmus\u2019s former assistant Felix Jones last year.

      "bodyText": "Europe\u2019s gas market rose by as much as 5% on Thursday to its highest price in a year after one of the continent\u2019s biggest gas traders said that there could be a halt on gas supplies from Russia. Austrian gas trader OMV has said that a court decision awarding the company compensation after its dispute with a subsidiary of Russia\u2019s Gazprom could lead the state-owned gas giant to halt supplies. Gas prices on Europe\u2019s main gas market jumped to more than \u20ac45 a megawatt hour for the first time since November last year amid fears that Europe could face higher risks of tight gas supplies this winter if OMVs gas supplies are cut off. In the UK the price of gas on the wholesale market price climbed by almost 3% from its close on Wednesday to trade at just more than 114 pence per therm by Thursday morning. Europe\u2019s gas market prices remain well below the historic highs of over \u20ac300/MWh in August 2022 after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine earlier in the year OMV was awarded \u20ac230m ($243m) under International Chamber of Commerce rules after its row with Gazprom over its supply contract.

The International Energy Agency has predicted that fossil fuels will become significantly cheaper and more abundant by the end of the decade because companies are producing more oil, gas and coal than the world needs. In its monthly oil market report, published on Thursday, the global watchdog said the world\u2019s oil supply will outstrip demand as soon as next year even if the Opec oil cartel and its allies keep a lid on their production due to rising oil production from countries including the US outpaces sluggish demand. This should bring down the price of petrol and food, according to the World Bank. At the moment Europe is well supplied with gas due to \u201cmaterially stronger\u201d flows of gas into the continent from Norway and weaker overall gas demand due to strong renew ables over the year, Rystad said. Rystad\u2019s data shows that the continent\u2019s imports of gas on seaborne vessels, known as liquified natural gas, rose 17% in October compared with the month before to help restock gas stores for the winter but this was still 16% lower than last year, reflecting weaker demand as a result of strong renewable energy generation this year.

I can see the other side of the argument because the Ryder Cup does create a lot of revenue. It\u2019s one of the top five biggest sporting events in the world so I get the argument that the talent could be getting paid.] t</p> <p>\u201cThe Ryder Cup is so much more than that, especially to the Europeans and this tour. We\u2019ve all had a conversation about it with Luke [Donald, the European captain] because we obviously heard [about the Americans] and the common consensus is that the $5m paid to the team would be better spent on the DP World Tour to support other events and even to support the Challenge Tour. For us, it would give it a different feel, what we have done a very good job of is being a very cohesive group over the last decade and we wouldn\u2019t want anything to change that.\u201d</p> <p>While understanding of the concept, McIlroy has questioned whether the payment to Team USA members is particularly necessary. He added: \u201cI don\u2019t think any of the 24 players on either team needs the $400,000. Every two years we play there\u2019s 104 weeks and for 103 you can play golf and can get paid so that\u2019s reasonable enough.</p> <p>\u201cGoing back to the purity aspect it would make the competition seem a little less pure but it wouldn\u2019t change anything from a European perspective. We would all welcome the money if it didn\u2019t change the dynamic of what we had but I think it would change the dynamic.\u201d </p> <p>The Ryder Cup, whichThe tournament will take place at Bethpage next September, has already attracted fierce criticism for $750 per day tickets during the competition itself. McIlroy admits that conversation will take on another dimension with players in part benefitting from steep prices.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes us look very unrelatable to the average person on the street because of how much money is being pumped into the game,\u201d said the four-time major winner. \u201cBut at the same time that\u2019s not our fault in a way. There\u2019s people willing to pay what they are willing to pay and we are fortunate to be in the position, we\u2019ve been in the right place at the right time.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s two sides to the coin. I\u2019m not criticising at all because if the Ryder Cup generates $100-200m in revenue you would think the talent should have a piece of that. That\u2019s not the way it has been and as Europeans we don\u2019t want to change because of how good it has been the last few years but it\u2019s more than reasonable that if you put an event on and it creates so much revenue that some of it should flow back to the talent but it hasn\u2019t been that way in the Ryder Cup and it\u2019s a massive change.\u201d</p> <p>McIlroy was speaking in Dubai, where he posted a 67 to tie the lead with Tyrrell Hatton after the first round of the season-ending DP World Tour Championship.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rory McIlroy has said he would pay to play in the Ryder Cup after it emerged US team members could collect $400,000 (\u00a3315,000) each for taking on Europe in New York next year. McIlroy believes such a move would undermine the \u201cpurity\u201d of the biennial contest. After pressure from leading players, the PGA of America\u2019s board is seriously considering breaking with Ryder Cup tradition and paying the 12-man American team from a $5m fund. No such plan will be considered in Europe; a situation McIlroy, the continent\u2019s leading player, is fully behind. \u201cI personally would pay for the privilege to play in the Ryder Cup,\u201d said McIlroy. \u201cI have come a long way in this especially with the Olympics but the two purest forms of competition in our game right now are the Ryder Cup and Olympics partly because of the purity of no money being involved. \u201cIt was a discussion that was happening at the last Ryder Cup in Rome. I can see the other side of the argument because the Ryder Cup does create a lot of revenue. It\u2019s one of the top five biggest sporting events in the world so I get the argument that the talent could be getting paid.] t \u201cThe Ryder Cup is so much more than that, especially to the Europeans and this tour. We\u2019ve all had a conversation about it with Luke [Donald, the European captain] because we obviously heard [about the Americans] and the common consensus is that the $5m paid to the team would be better spent on the DP World Tour to support other events and even to support the Challenge Tour. For us, it would give it a different feel, what we have done a very good job of is being a very cohesive group over the last decade and we wouldn\u2019t want anything to change that.\u201d While understanding of the concept, McIlroy has questioned whether the payment to Team USA members is particularly necessary. He added: \u201cI don\u2019t think any of the 24 players on either team needs the $400,000. Every two years we play there\u2019s 104 weeks and for 103 you can play golf and can get paid so that\u2019s reasonable enough. \u201cGoing back to the purity aspect it would make the competition seem a little less pure but it wouldn\u2019t change anything from a European perspective. We would all welcome the money if it didn\u2019t change the dynamic of what we had but I think it would change the dynamic.\u201d The Ryder Cup, whichThe tournament will take place at Bethpage next September, has already attracted fierce criticism for $750 per day tickets during the competition itself. McIlroy admits that conversation will take on another dimension with players in part benefitting from steep prices. \u201cIt makes us look very unrelatable to the average person on the street because of how much money is being pumped into the game,\u201d said the four-time major winner. \u201cBut at the same time that\u2019s not our fault in a way. There\u2019s people willing to pay what they are willing to pay and we are fortunate to be in the position, we\u2019ve been in the right place at the right time. \u201cThere\u2019s two sides to the coin. I\u2019m not criticising at all because if the Ryder Cup generates $100-200m in revenue you would think the talent should have a piece of that. That\u2019s not the way it has been and as Europeans we don\u2019t want to change because of how good it has been the last few years but it\u2019s more than reasonable that if you put an event on and it creates so much revenue that some of it should flow back to the talent but it hasn\u2019t been that way in the Ryder Cup and it\u2019s a massive change.\u201d McIlroy was speaking in Dubai, where he posted a 67 to tie the lead with Tyrrell Hatton after the first round of the season-ending DP World Tour Championship.",

To reach his target, Trump would have to uproot the lives of undocumented people who have lived in the US for years. He has pledged to build <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/03/trump-mass-deportations-detention-camps-military-migrants\">mass detention camps</a> and deputize national guard troops and local police to assist the effort.</p> <p>In 2017, California was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/05/california-sanctuary-state-law-trump\">first</a> state to pass a sanctuary law under Trump. The bill prohibited local law enforcement from assisting US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), and it had major effect. While local police had been transferring thousands of immigrants to Ice each year before, those numbers dwindled to the hundreds, according to advocates who reviewed state data.</p> <p>Nationally, Trump <a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/trump-deportations-unfinished-mission\">did not</a> meet his overall removal goals \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/03/02/how-border-apprehensions-ice-arrests-and-deportations-have-changed-under-trump/\">arresting</a> fewer immigrants within the country and carrying out <a href=\"https://www.statesman.com/story/news/politics/politifact/2024/01/07/politifact-obama-deported-more-people-than-trump-did/72120774007/\">fewer deportations than Obama</a> \u2013 in part because of California\u2019s and other states\u2019 sanctuary policies.</p> <p>Before California\u2019s bill was signed, however, it was <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article172712181.html\">watered down</a> to allow state prisons to coordinate with Ice, and to give Ice agents access to interview people in jails. The final version also weakened proposals to limit police data-sharing with Ice. Those loopholes have continued to leave many immigrants vulnerable.</p> <p>Activists and some lawmakers have since fought to strengthen the sanctuary policy in recent years. But California\u2019s governor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gavin-newsom\">Gavin Newsom</a>, a Democrat now styling himself as an anti-Trump <a href=\"https://x.com/GavinNewsom/status/1854572280200012139?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\">leader</a>, has repeatedly opposed those efforts, which advocates say could have made the state better equipped for Trump\u2019s new threat of mass deportations.</p> <p>\u201cCalifornia has its own culpability in feeding the deportation machine, which advocates have been pointing out for years,\u201d said Anoop Prasad, advocacy director of the Asian Prisoner Support Committee, which supports incarcerated Californians. \u201cGovernor Newsom hasn\u2019t taken action on those calls in prior years, but hopefully now he\u2019s willing to understand the urgency.\u201d</p> <p>In 2019, Newsom vetoed a bill passed by lawmakers that would have banned <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/SF-Gov-Newsom-vetoes-law-banning-private-arrests-14539531.php\">private security agents</a> from entering prisons to arrest immigrants. In 2023, he <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/home-act-veto-18369729.php\">vetoed</a> another measure widely supported by legislators that would have stopped transfers from prisons to Ice. This year, he <a href=\"https://edsource.org/updates/newsom-vetoes-bill-that-would-have-allowed-hiring-of-undocumented-students\">vetoed</a> a bill that would have allowed undocumented students to be hired for campus jobs.</p> <p>\u201cThe state government can limit its participation in enforcement to the maximum extent possible and can provide as many benefits [to immigrants] as possible, consistent with federal law,\u201d said Ahilan Arulanantham, faculty co-director of the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at UCLA.</p> <p>Arulanantham, an immigrant rights attorney, said research has repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/upshot/deportations-crime-study.html\">supported</a> the public safety benefits of sanctuary policies, showing that jurisdictions that reduce cooperation with Ice don\u2019t see <a href=\"https://law.stanford.edu/press/sanctuary-policies-protect-immigrants-but-dont-threaten-public-safety-new-stanford-research/\">increases in crime</a>. \u201cI\u2019d hope a blue state politician would say, \u2018We\u2019re going to be evidence-based and rational and not worry about immigrants <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/10/trump-springfield-pets-false-claims\">eating cats</a>,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe rational policy is we should not do cooperation, because there\u2019s no evidence it makes us safer, and it tears communities apart.\u201d</p> <p>He said he hoped California would expand funding for legal representation for immigrants. During Trump\u2019s first term, California also attempted to ban private immigration detention, but was <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/californias-attempt-ban-private-immigration-detention-hits-snag\">blocked</a> in court, and Arulanantham said legislators should look at other ways to thwart the expansion of these facilities.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good time to zoom out and map the deportation system, which is interwoven throughout the state,\u201d added Prasad. \u201cIt\u2019s using not just state government resources, but also our airports, our roads. There are detention centers in our communities.

      "bodyText": "California, home to the largest immigrant population in the US, is bracing for Donald Trump\u2019s plan to enact the \u201clargest deportation operation in American history\u201d, with advocates pushing state leaders to find new and creative ways to disrupt his agenda. The Golden state led the fight against Trump\u2019s first term, shielding many non-citizen residents from removal by restricting local cooperation with federal immigration authorities. But the threat this time, immigrant rights groups say, is more extreme, and blue states across the US are facing pressure to mount an aggressive, multipronged response. \u201cCommunities that will be involved in mutual aid and self-defense are prepared,\u201d said Chris Newman, general counsel for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, a California-based group that supports immigrants. \u201cI think many lawmakers, frankly, are not. They were primarily focused on supporting Kamala Harris, and people\u2019s hope for the best got in the way of their preparation for the worst.\u201d Trump, who built his political career on racist, xenophobic rhetoric, has said he wants to expel \u201cas many as 20 million people\u201d from the US in his second term. That would mark a dramatic increase from his first administration, in which he carried out several hundred thousand removals a year, in line with other recent presidents. To reach his target, Trump would have to uproot the lives of undocumented people who have lived in the US for years. He has pledged to build mass detention camps and deputize national guard troops and local police to assist the effort. In 2017, California was the first state to pass a sanctuary law under Trump. The bill prohibited local law enforcement from assisting US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), and it had major effect. While local police had been transferring thousands of immigrants to Ice each year before, those numbers dwindled to the hundreds, according to advocates who reviewed state data. Nationally, Trump did not meet his overall removal goals \u2013 arresting fewer immigrants within the country and carrying out fewer deportations than Obama \u2013 in part because of California\u2019s and other states\u2019 sanctuary policies. Before California\u2019s bill was signed, however, it was watered down to allow state prisons to coordinate with Ice, and to give Ice agents access to interview people in jails. The final version also weakened proposals to limit police data-sharing with Ice. Those loopholes have continued to leave many immigrants vulnerable. Activists and some lawmakers have since fought to strengthen the sanctuary policy in recent years. But California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, a Democrat now styling himself as an anti-Trump leader, has repeatedly opposed those efforts, which advocates say could have made the state better equipped for Trump\u2019s new threat of mass deportations. \u201cCalifornia has its own culpability in feeding the deportation machine, which advocates have been pointing out for years,\u201d said Anoop Prasad, advocacy director of the Asian Prisoner Support Committee, which supports incarcerated Californians. \u201cGovernor Newsom hasn\u2019t taken action on those calls in prior years, but hopefully now he\u2019s willing to understand the urgency.\u201d In 2019, Newsom vetoed a bill passed by lawmakers that would have banned private security agents from entering prisons to arrest immigrants. In 2023, he vetoed another measure widely supported by legislators that would have stopped transfers from prisons to Ice. This year, he vetoed a bill that would have allowed undocumented students to be hired for campus jobs. \u201cThe state government can limit its participation in enforcement to the maximum extent possible and can provide as many benefits [to immigrants] as possible, consistent with federal law,\u201d said Ahilan Arulanantham, faculty co-director of the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at UCLA. Arulanantham, an immigrant rights attorney, said research has repeatedly supported the public safety benefits of sanctuary policies, showing that jurisdictions that reduce cooperation with Ice don\u2019t see increases in crime. \u201cI\u2019d hope a blue state politician would say, \u2018We\u2019re going to be evidence-based and rational and not worry about immigrants eating cats,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe rational policy is we should not do cooperation, because there\u2019s no evidence it makes us safer, and it tears communities apart.\u201d He said he hoped California would expand funding for legal representation for immigrants. During Trump\u2019s first term, California also attempted to ban private immigration detention, but was blocked in court, and Arulanantham said legislators should look at other ways to thwart the expansion of these facilities. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to zoom out and map the deportation system, which is interwoven throughout the state,\u201d added Prasad. \u201cIt\u2019s using not just state government resources, but also our airports, our roads. There are detention centers in our communities. Companies registered in the state are providing transportation to Ice to carry out deportations.\u201d A county in Washington state blocked deportation flights from its local airport in 2019, for example, but was ultimately thwarted in court. Newsom could also pardon immigrants with old criminal records, shielding them from deportations. He has done this before in notable cases of refugees facing removal due to old cases, but his clemency rate has been lower than his predecessor, said Angela Chan, assistant chief attorney of the San Francisco public defender\u2019s office. \u201cThat is a very important power he could tap into. These are often green card holders who\u2019ve been in this country since they were young, faced trouble at a young age, served sentences, earned release, then are facing the double punishment of deportation.\u201d She said she hoped lawmakers looked for ways to further limit data sharing with Ice and prevent local police from being involved in joint federal task forces that involve any immigration enforcement purposes. A spokesperson for Newsom did not respond to questions about specific proposals.

He said he was also prepared to hold accountable any pro-Trump county sheriffs who go rogue and attempt to assist the president-elect\u2019s deportation agenda. It\u2019s a threat advocates are increasingly monitoring. \u201cThere will be recalcitrant sheriffs in California who will try to circumvent and delegitimize the state sanctuary policy,\u201d said Newman, noting Trump\u2019s ties to Joe Arpaio, an infamous Arizona sheriff who brutally targeted immigrants and was convicted of criminal contempt for his actions. \u201cThere will probably be one or more sheriffs in California who want to be the next Joe Arpaio with regular appearances on Fox News.\u201d Newman noted there were new threats from Trump this time, including cracking down on activists and using the national guard. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to get creative in terms of defensive measures,\u201d he said.

Cheryl McKenna, 44, was discovered by police officers at a property in Other Road, near Redditch town centre, at about 9.30am on Monday. Two ambulances and the Midlands air ambulance were dispatched to the address but McKenna was pronounced dead at the scene. A spokesperson for West Midlands ambulance service said: \u201cOn arrival crews found a woman in a critical condition and they immediately began administering advanced life support. \u201cSadly, despite their best efforts it became apparent nothing could be done to save the woman and she was confirmed dead at the scene.\u201d Chris Hemming, 46, of Other Road in Redditch, was charged with her murder and was due to appear at Worcester crown court on Thursday. In a statement, McKenna\u2019s family said: \u201cCheryl was a huge and integral part of our family and will be missed terribly as a mother, daughter, sister and aunt.\u201d On Monday, Chris Bloore, the MP for Redditch, said his \u201cthoughts are with the family and friends impacted by this tragic event\u201d. He added: \u201cThe police have informed me there is no further risk to the wider public. There will be an increased police presence in the area as inquiries continue.\u201d DCI Gareth Lougher from West Mercia police said: \u201cOfficers and paramedics were promptly on scene. However, it became clear the woman\u2019s injuries were not survivable and she sadly died at the scene. \u201cI would like to reassure the local community we believe there to be no wider risk to the public.\u201d One resident of the street told BirminghamLive it was \u201cshocking and sad\u201d news: \u201cIt\u2019s devastating it\u2019s on your doorstep.\u201d",

At times, you don\u2019t know whether to wince at the collisions or weld your eyes open, Clockwork Orange-style, so that you don\u2019t miss a single step. He has reached a point where smaller defenders are leaping off his way in the open field, as if he brings actual death and terror, <a href=\"https://x.com/TheLionsMan/status/1856046684591018389\">sometimes crashing into their teammates</a> to avoid the big man delivering a clean strike.</p> <p>The Lions know they\u2019re dealing with something special.

But for the Lions, that player is their nimble giant.</p> <p>Last week, with the Lions in a 10-point hole on the road in Houston, they turned to Sewell. On third-and-long late in the third quarter, with the Texans having a shot to ice the game, Detroit\u2019s offensive coordinator, Ben Johnson, put the game in the hands and feet of his tackle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/theTNShow/status/1855820208927125810\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">did anyone see Penei Sewell on that Gibbs catch\u2026.my God!!!! \ud83d\udca8 <a href=\"https://t.co/1OnW5nkPJw\">pic.twitter.com/1OnW5nkPJw</a></p>&mdash; NaronStradomus (@theTNShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theTNShow/status/1855820208927125810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 11, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>Hoo boy.

But the main course is Sewell blasting people off the ball. There has been a nearly 18% increase in running plays league-wide this season. No team has bought into the shift more than the Lions. And no individual run play has been more successful this season than a running back scooting behind Sewell. On runs targeted behind Sewell this season, 52.5% have gone for a first down or touchdown, according to Pro Football Focus. No other Lions lineman sniffs the 40% mark and only one other tackle in the league, Denver\u2019s Garett Bolles, has crossed the 45% threshold.

When I asked Levine about this, he said: \u201cIf we can reduce the costs, make it economic to invest in clean energy and mitigation, then you will see the markets and businesses follow.\u201d</p> <p>Asked whether or not the US will submit a new \u201cnationally determined contribution\u201d \u2014 or decarbonization plan \u2014 to the UN during Cop29, Levine said officials are \u201clooking hard at what may be possible.\u201d </p> <p>Politico yesterday reported that a submission is <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/us-donald-trump-new-climate-target-2035-paris-agreement/\">likely</a> to pledge a new target soon.</p> <p>The new plans aren\u2019t due until February, shortly after Trump takes office.

Think a single espresso might do the trick - $3.50 appears to be the cheapest coffee on offer. How about vitamin C boost? A small grapefruit juice is $11.</p> <p>Those feeling peckish after hours trailing around the vast venue need to dig deep. At the budget end, a \u201cchicken toast\u201d sandwich is still $9.50, a beef bagel \u2013 with \u201ccanned beef\u201d is $11 and a salmon buddha bowl is $16.50. A sweet treat to lift the mood? A small chocolate bar sets you back $5.50.</p> <p>If it\u2019s an actual meal that\u2019s required, a frankly horrible \u201cgroot\u201d vegan burger, fries and coke will dent your budget by $23. For comparison, you can get a whole pizza, soup, salad and soft drink for less than $10 in Baku city.</p> <p>It is the most expensive catering the Guardian can remember at a Cop and can only be described as price-gouging exploitation of delegates trapped in the giant conference site all day. Returning to the city for a cheaper bite would involve at least 90 minutes of travel.</p> <p>The issue is actually a serious one. Climate Cops are where every country in the world comes to make its case and many of those most affected by the climate crisis are poor. High costs mean they can bring few delegates, making their voices less heard, and that is unjust.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s crazy \u2013 for one stupid sandwich, you pay the same as what we paid for the whole week [outside the conference],\u201d says Sandra Guzman, from Mexico. \u201cOutside the conference, everything is so cheap, and then you come here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair at all \u2013 not at all,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this is precisely why delegations from smaller countries have only one or two people \u2013 they cannot afford it.\u201d Rich country delegates run to hundreds and even thousands of delegates.</p> <p>Some delegates have been forced to improvise. One South Pacific delegate has a half-eaten Pot Noodle on her desk, having been stung for $33 the previous day. She took warm water from a water fountain to make it. Even those from rich nations are unhappy. \u201cIt\u2019s super super expensive,\u201d said a US delegate. \u201cThat sandwich was $15 - I mean really!</p> <p>Azerbaijani journalist, Oruj Alasgarov, has also been investigating the prices: \u201cA lot of people are very angry.\u201d The lack of the usual long queues at Coop for food and drink suggests many people are balking at the prices.</p> <p>For any delegate feeling extremely flush there is a bar. Among the offerings there are a bottle of red wine \u2013 Solaia 2016 \u2013 for $1940. It appears to be available online for about $500. The cheapest red wine \u2013 Meyseri Mekhmeri \u2013 is a comparative snip at $74. There\u2019s also Dom Perignom Brut champagne at $880 and the cheapest sparkling wine \u2013 Astoria brut \u2013 is $69.</p> <p>If spirits are your thing, there\u2019s Don Julio 1942 tequila at $80 a shot. How many of these extortionate drinks are being bought is unclear. Some bottles of champagne have shifted, the Guardian was told, but delegates have resisted the cognac on offer so far, priced at $35 -$80 a go.</p> <p>Rapacious catering costs have been an issue at some previous summits. At Cop27 in Sharm el Sheik, Egypt, protests at ludicrous prices led the organisers to halve the cost of the drinks and provide lower cost food options. The UN and Cop29 have been contacted for comment. They have already had to \u201chighlight\u201d the vegan and vegetarian food options available, after \u201cqueries\u201d.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-14T15:35:26.465Z\">at 3.35pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6735feca8f0853b3aa36249d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/oliver-milman\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-14T14:32:34.968Z\">2.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Republican party may be ascendent in the US, having just clinched the presidency and both houses of Congress, but its presence at the Cop29 talks is tellingly light.</p> <p>A small number of Republican members of the House of Representatives, including Troy Balderson of Ohio and August Pfluger of Texas, are attending, along with a group of GOP staffers who work for members of Congress and committees.</p>    <p>As at previous Cops, it\u2019s expected the Republicans will tout the need for expanded US energy production and question whether other countries such as China are doing enough to cut emissions. This year, the lawmakers will also be able to crow about the election of Donald Trump as president.</p> <p>Trump has been busy making appointments in the US \u2013 controversially nominating Matt Gaetz as attorney general yesterday \u2013 and his transition team swatted away questions on whether it would send someone to the climate talks.</p> <p>\u201cThe American people re-elected president Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver,\u201d said Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the Trump transition.</p> <p>Those promises include Trump\u2019s vow to remove the US from the Paris climate deal and eviscerate American climate policies, so there is little surprise that his incoming administration would not make the trip to Baku. Instead, the US is represented, rather forlornly, by the outgoing Joe Biden team, who have been trying to muster some optimism despite the upcoming second iteration of a Trump White House.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-673604c28f0847d6f9289649\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/fiona-harvey\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-14T14:27:30.417Z\">2.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">A solidarity levy on cryptocurrency could raise billions of dollars for climate action</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Including cryptocurrency in a set of new possible solidarity levies on high-carbon goods and services would generate $5bn a year for the climate crisis, the <a href=\"https://globalsolidaritylevies.org/app/uploads/2024/11/GSLTF-Scaling-Solidarity-Progress-on-Global-Solidarity-Levies-report.pdf\">new report from the Global Solidarity Levies taskforce</a> has shown. </p> <p>As Damian Carrington noted earlier, the idea of \u2018solidarity levies\u2019 has some powerful backers, including Emmanuel Macron and Mia Mottley. The report, published today, usefully drills down into where those levies might be applied.</p> <p>Crypto is notoriously energy-intensive \u2013 by one estimate, mining bitcoin accounted for close to 1% of global energy demand last year. Charging just $0.045 per kWh for the energy would produce $5bn, according to the second report of the Global Solidarity Levies taskforce.</p> <p>The taskforce, led by the French ex-diplomat and current chief executive of the European Climate Foundation, Laurence Tubiana, who was one of the architects of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, was set up to work on the initiative started by France, Barbados and Kenya to find innovative forms of finance that would produce cash to help poor countries cope with the climate crisis.</p> <p>Other forms of levy would generate even more towards the \u201cnew collective quantified goal\u201d on climate finance that is the key issue at Cop29. For instance, the report found that a plastics production levy, charged on producing plastics from polymers rather than from recycled material, would yield about $25bn-$35bn a year if set at $60 to $90 a tonne.</p> <p>A 2% wealth tax, such as the one championed by Brazil, would yield $200bn-$250bn a year. Taxing frequent flyers and business class airline tickets would also be lucrative, with up to $164bn a year possible.</p> <p>A separate report by the independent high level expert group on climate finance found on Thursday that poor countries needed $1tn a year by 2030, of which about half should come from the private sector, about a quarter from multilateral development banks, and the rest from a mixture of grants and loans directly from developed countries, and innovative forms of finance such as the global solidarity levies.</p> <p>However, these levies \u2013 along with other potential charges such as a financial transactions tax, levies on fossil fuels and a charge on international shipping - are still only concepts, and none have yet been accepted by governments. There are many obstacles to their adoption, not least the unlikelihood of being able to get any form of global levy past the Donald Trump White House. Some countries could still go ahead despite this, but others are likely to use US non-participation as an excuse for inaction.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-14T15:07:36.237Z\">at 3.07pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6735fd208f0853b3aa36248a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-14T14:04:14.648Z\">2.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague <strong>Dharna Noor</strong> has been visiting the pavilions and speaking to some of the youth delegates including two teenaged girls who travelled to Cop29 from South Sudan.</p>    <p>She reports: Naomi, 14, is at Cop for the second time this year after attending last year\u2019s talks in Dubai.

They include taxes on fossil fuels, flights, shipping and financial transactions. They also have serious backers, with French president Emmanuel Macron, Barbadian prime minster Mia Amor Mottley and Kenyan president William Ruto the prime movers.</p> <p>Macron, Mottley and Ruto make a powerful case in a recent <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/solidarity-levies-carbon-pollution-by-emmanuel-macron-et-al-2024-11\">article in Project Syndicate</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cOne key piece of the international financial architecture is still underused [to raise climate finance]: \u2018solidarity levies\u2019. Such policies are necessary to ensure that everyone contributes their fair share to what should be a global effort. There are swaths of the economy which are largely under-taxed yet polluting the planet. This applies to maritime shipping, aviation, and, of course, the fossil-fuel industry, which enjoys low effective tax rates due to government subsidies (totaling an estimated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/24/fossil-fuel-subsidies-imf-report-climate-crisis-oil-gas-coal\">$7 trillion</a> in 2022, according to the IMF).</p> <p>\u201cA global levy of 0.1% on stock and bond trades could raise up to $418bn per year. A levy on shipping of $100 per ton of carbon dioxide could raise $80bn per year. A levy on fossil-fuel extraction of $5 per ton of CO2 could raise $210bn per year. Even a partial redistribution through solidarity levies would guarantee a large source of predictable climate finance</p> <p>\u201cThese levies already exist. More than 30 countries currently implement a financial transaction tax, and at least 21 have a levy on airplane tickets. Moreover, even small-scale initiatives such as the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds demonstrate the feasibility of an international redistribution mechanism</p> <p>\u201cIn early 2025, we [the <a href=\"https://globalsolidaritylevies.org/\">Global Solidarity Levies Task Force</a>] will publicly launch a handful of concrete proposals with rigorous impact assessments. These will be scalable \u2013 raising at least $100 billion per year.</p> <p>\u201cIn the case of global solidarity levies, the only innovation required is ambitious leadership across a sufficient base of countries. Let the tenth anniversary of the Paris climate agreement next year be remembered as the moment when we came together as a global community to implement solidarity levies, providing the financial tools necessary to meet the great challenge of our time.</p> </blockquote> <p>Friederike Roder, at Global Citizen, said: \u201cThese levies offer the most effective means of achieving a step change in grant financing in the short term and providing support to the poorest and most indebted countries.

Greenpeace said the move was \u201cabsolutely shameful\u201d. WWF took aim at the European People\u2019s Party, the centre-right grouping that had previously supported the law, for choosing \u201cpolitical posturing over climate action.\u201d</p>    <p>The law aims to fight climate breakdown and the death of nature by stopping deforestation related to the EU\u2019s consumption of food and other goods. It covers products such as beef, cocoa, coffee, palm oil and paper.<br><br>Campaigners also criticised the introduction of a new category of countries posing \u201cno risk\u201d on deforestation, which the Parliament says will face \u201csignificantly less stringent\u201d rules.

She pointed to a statement from China\u2019s vice-premier, Ding Xuexiang, who told world leaders on Tuesday that China has stumped up RMB 177 billion ($24.5 billion) to support other country\u2019s climate efforts since 2016. The sum works out at about $3 billion per year.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an important mini-step,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cBut it remains open exactly which flows of money are counted here - and the quality of the financing is at the moment unclear.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cIt shows China can do a lot, and is already doing something. But only that which is transparent can be recognised.\u201d</p> <p>Poor countries need $1 trillion a year in climate finance by 2030, five years earlier than rich countries are likely to agree to at UN climate talks.

The highlights (and lowlights) have included: There has been deepening concern and division over the climate finance goal, with some countries saying there was little chance of agreement even as Azerbaijani officials were optimistic. Solidarity levies emerged as a popular option for raising some of the money desperately needed for climate action. Possible targets could include cryptcurrency, the ultra wealthy, and frequent flyers. US officials are still claiming that Biden\u2019s energy revolution will be \u201cunstoppable\u201d, but the Republicans have been in short supply at Cop. Back in Europe, members of the European Parliament voted to postpone a landmark deforestation law. A new report from Global Witness found that 880,000 people in COP29 host Azerbaijan live within 5km of a gas flaring site. Climate activist groups at Cop29 linked the war in Gaza to the climate crisis \u2013 arguing that western governments and big oil are driving both, with dire consequences for humanity. Elsewhere, protesters called to \u201cmake polluters pay\u201d on a banner festooned across the terraces of the huge football stadium that is at the heart of the Cop29 conference. And Climate Action Network\u2019s report found that current policies would lead to a disastrous 2.7C of warming. US President Joe Biden\u2019s climate actions have sparked an unstoppable clean energy \u201crevolution\u201d, a US official told reporters today. Jacob Levine, Biden\u2019s climate and energy assistant, said the president has set into motion a \u201cdeeply shared and integrated vision\u201d for the clean energy transition. \u201cYes, we\u2019ll focus on decarbonization, accelerating the transition,\u201d he said. \u201cBut fundamentally, what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re building a vision for economic growth, for job creation, for equitable distribution of the benefits that we\u2019ll create from an investment perspective and from an economic perspective.\u201d Even when climate denier Donald Trump takes office early next year, the private sector will continue to drive up demand for carbon-free technologies, he said. \u201cThe clean energy revolution is here, and it really cannot be stopped,\u201d he said. But though Biden expanded incentives for renewable power and electric vehicles, during his administration, US oil and gas production surged to record highs. When I asked Levine about this, he said: \u201cIf we can reduce the costs, make it economic to invest in clean energy and mitigation, then you will see the markets and businesses follow.\u201d Asked whether or not the US will submit a new \u201cnationally determined contribution\u201d \u2014 or decarbonization plan \u2014 to the UN during Cop29, Levine said officials are \u201clooking hard at what may be possible.\u201d Politico yesterday reported that a submission is likely to pledge a new target soon. The new plans aren\u2019t due until February, shortly after Trump takes office. Some are pressuring the US to submit a new pledge quickly, especially because the incoming president has pledged to quickly pull the US from the Paris Agreement. There is always anger and outrage at injustice at climate Cops, but one target of this might surprise you \u2013 the outrageous price of the catering inside the closed conference. Delegates needing perking up after a late night of negotiating have to shell out $10 for an Americano with soy milk. Think a single espresso might do the trick - $3.50 appears to be the cheapest coffee on offer. How about vitamin C boost? A small grapefruit juice is $11. Those feeling peckish after hours trailing around the vast venue need to dig deep. At the budget end, a \u201cchicken toast\u201d sandwich is still $9.50, a beef bagel \u2013 with \u201ccanned beef\u201d is $11 and a salmon buddha bowl is $16.50. A sweet treat to lift the mood? A small chocolate bar sets you back $5.50. If it\u2019s an actual meal that\u2019s required, a frankly horrible \u201cgroot\u201d vegan burger, fries and coke will dent your budget by $23. For comparison, you can get a whole pizza, soup, salad and soft drink for less than $10 in Baku city. It is the most expensive catering the Guardian can remember at a Cop and can only be described as price-gouging exploitation of delegates trapped in the giant conference site all day. Returning to the city for a cheaper bite would involve at least 90 minutes of travel. The issue is actually a serious one. Climate Cops are where every country in the world comes to make its case and many of those most affected by the climate crisis are poor. High costs mean they can bring few delegates, making their voices less heard, and that is unjust. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy \u2013 for one stupid sandwich, you pay the same as what we paid for the whole week [outside the conference],\u201d says Sandra Guzman, from Mexico. \u201cOutside the conference, everything is so cheap, and then you come here.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not fair at all \u2013 not at all,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this is precisely why delegations from smaller countries have only one or two people \u2013 they cannot afford it.\u201d Rich country delegates run to hundreds and even thousands of delegates. Some delegates have been forced to improvise. One South Pacific delegate has a half-eaten Pot Noodle on her desk, having been stung for $33 the previous day. She took warm water from a water fountain to make it. Even those from rich nations are unhappy. \u201cIt\u2019s super super expensive,\u201d said a US delegate. \u201cThat sandwich was $15 - I mean really! Azerbaijani journalist, Oruj Alasgarov, has also been investigating the prices: \u201cA lot of people are very angry.\u201d The lack of the usual long queues at Coop for food and drink suggests many people are balking at the prices. For any delegate feeling extremely flush there is a bar. Among the offerings there are a bottle of red wine \u2013 Solaia 2016 \u2013 for $1940. It appears to be available online for about $500. The cheapest red wine \u2013 Meyseri Mekhmeri \u2013 is a comparative snip at $74. There\u2019s also Dom Perignom Brut champagne at $880 and the cheapest sparkling wine \u2013 Astoria brut \u2013 is $69. If spirits are your thing, there\u2019s Don Julio 1942 tequila at $80 a shot. How many of these extortionate drinks are being bought is unclear. Some bottles of champagne have shifted, the Guardian was told, but delegates have resisted the cognac on offer so far, priced at $35 -$80 a go. Rapacious catering costs have been an issue at some previous summits. At Cop27 in Sharm el Sheik, Egypt, protests at ludicrous prices led the organisers to halve the cost of the drinks and provide lower cost food options. The UN and Cop29 have been contacted for comment. They have already had to \u201chighlight\u201d the vegan and vegetarian food options available, after \u201cqueries\u201d. The Republican party may be ascendent in the US, having just clinched the presidency and both houses of Congress, but its presence at the Cop29 talks is tellingly light. A small number of Republican members of the House of Representatives, including Troy Balderson of Ohio and August Pfluger of Texas, are attending, along with a group of GOP staffers who work for members of Congress and committees. As at previous Cops, it\u2019s expected the Republicans will tout the need for expanded US energy production and question whether other countries such as China are doing enough to cut emissions. This year, the lawmakers will also be able to crow about the election of Donald Trump as president. Trump has been busy making appointments in the US \u2013 controversially nominating Matt Gaetz as attorney general yesterday \u2013 and his transition team swatted away questions on whether it would send someone to the climate talks. \u201cThe American people re-elected president Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver,\u201d said Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the Trump transition. Those promises include Trump\u2019s vow to remove the US from the Paris climate deal and eviscerate American climate policies, so there is little surprise that his incoming administration would not make the trip to Baku. Instead, the US is represented, rather forlornly, by the outgoing Joe Biden team, who have been trying to muster some optimism despite the upcoming second iteration of a Trump White House. Including cryptocurrency in a set of new possible solidarity levies on high-carbon goods and services would generate $5bn a year for the climate crisis, the new report from the Global Solidarity Levies taskforce has shown. As Damian Carrington noted earlier, the idea of \u2018solidarity levies\u2019 has some powerful backers, including Emmanuel Macron and Mia Mottley. The report, published today, usefully drills down into where those levies might be applied. Crypto is notoriously energy-intensive \u2013 by one estimate, mining bitcoin accounted for close to 1% of global energy demand last year. Charging just $0.045 per kWh for the energy would produce $5bn, according to the second report of the Global Solidarity Levies taskforce. The taskforce, led by the French ex-diplomat and current chief executive of the European Climate Foundation, Laurence Tubiana, who was one of the architects of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, was set up to work on the initiative started by France, Barbados and Kenya to find innovative forms of finance that would produce cash to help poor countries cope with the climate crisis. Other forms of levy would generate even more towards the \u201cnew collective quantified goal\u201d on climate finance that is the key issue at Cop29. For instance, the report found that a plastics production levy, charged on producing plastics from polymers rather than from recycled material, would yield about $25bn-$35bn a year if set at $60 to $90 a tonne. A 2% wealth tax, such as the one championed by Brazil, would yield $200bn-$250bn a year. Taxing frequent flyers and business class airline tickets would also be lucrative, with up to $164bn a year possible. A separate report by the independent high level expert group on climate finance found on Thursday that poor countries needed $1tn a year by 2030, of which about half should come from the private sector, about a quarter from multilateral development banks, and the rest from a mixture of grants and loans directly from developed countries, and innovative forms of finance such as the global solidarity levies. However, these levies \u2013 along with other potential charges such as a financial transactions tax, levies on fossil fuels and a charge on international shipping - are still only concepts, and none have yet been accepted by governments. There are many obstacles to their adoption, not least the unlikelihood of being able to get any form of global levy past the Donald Trump White House. Some countries could still go ahead despite this, but others are likely to use US non-participation as an excuse for inaction. My colleague Dharna Noor has been visiting the pavilions and speaking to some of the youth delegates including two teenaged girls who travelled to Cop29 from South Sudan. She reports: Naomi, 14, is at Cop for the second time this year after attending last year\u2019s talks in Dubai. This year, schools across South Sudan were forced to close for two full weeks during an extreme heat wave. \u201cSouth Sudan is one of the countries that contributed at least 1% to the climate crisis, but we are experiencing 95% of the effects,\u201d she said. \u201cSo my message is the world leaders, or the leaders of the countries that are the main causes of these should contribute, should be accountable for their actions.\u201d With more climate finance, Naomi said, South Sudan leaders could build more climate-resilient schools and plant more trees to provide shade from the oppressive heat. Siama, 16, is attending Cop for the first time. She described how she felt during this year\u2019s heat wave, when temperatures soared to 45C (113F). \u201cOh my gosh. It feels like you\u2019re frying up, or you\u2019re burning up or something of that kind,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really bad.\u201d Naomi chimed in: \u201cEspecially for the communities without electricity so they do not have ACs.\u201d They both also described the horrors of flooding in South Sudan, which has displaced thousands and taken lives \u2014 including of children. \u201cPeople do not just want to die out there. People want to survive,\u201d said Siama. \u201cAnd it\u2019s also climate change that is threatening the life of children and youth out there.\u201d Though they\u2019re facing grave climate impacts and are serious about their push for ambitious action at Cop, Siama and Naomi, whose trips to Baku were sponsored by the NGO Save the Children, have also managed to have some fun at the conference. Siama said she\u2019s loved meeting other young climate activists. Naomi agreed: \u201cThat\u2019s the best part!\u201d Every so often negotiators have to break off from arguing over commas to escape the negotiating rooms and go for a wander around the rest of the massive Cop base. Countries set up their own pavilions, and they take it with more or less seriousness, depending on who they are. Some see it as a chance to project themselves into the discussions, others to make their plea, and still others as a chance to show that they\u2019ve got a hell of a lot of money. Turkey is taking a more meditative approach. Azerbaijan, the host nation, seems to be taking its responsibilities very seriously and feeding people. We\u2019re not quite sure what is going on at the Malaysia pavilion, to be honest. Britain have gone for the full twee red telephone box experience. Would not at all be surprised to see Paddington bear there somewhere. Please send us pictures of your pavilion and we\u2019ll round up some more glorious Cop pavilion action! You can email me photos at bibi.vanderzee@theguardian.com Among the ways of raising money to provide the $1tn in climate finance, so-called \u201csolidarity levies\u201d are perhaps the most interesting - technically simple, but able to raise very large sums. They include taxes on fossil fuels, flights, shipping and financial transactions. They also have serious backers, with French president Emmanuel Macron, Barbadian prime minster Mia Amor Mottley and Kenyan president William Ruto the prime movers. Macron, Mottley and Ruto make a powerful case in a recent article in Project Syndicate: \u201cOne key piece of the international financial architecture is still underused [to raise climate finance]: \u2018solidarity levies\u2019. Such policies are necessary to ensure that everyone contributes their fair share to what should be a global effort. There are swaths of the economy which are largely under-taxed yet polluting the planet. This applies to maritime shipping, aviation, and, of course, the fossil-fuel industry, which enjoys low effective tax rates due to government subsidies (totaling an estimated $7 trillion in 2022, according to the IMF). \u201cA global levy of 0.1% on stock and bond trades could raise up to $418bn per year. A levy on shipping of $100 per ton of carbon dioxide could raise $80bn per year. A levy on fossil-fuel extraction of $5 per ton of CO2 could raise $210bn per year. Even a partial redistribution through solidarity levies would guarantee a large source of predictable climate finance \u201cThese levies already exist. More than 30 countries currently implement a financial transaction tax, and at least 21 have a levy on airplane tickets. Moreover, even small-scale initiatives such as the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds demonstrate the feasibility of an international redistribution mechanism \u201cIn early 2025, we [the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force] will publicly launch a handful of concrete proposals with rigorous impact assessments. These will be scalable \u2013 raising at least $100 billion per year. \u201cIn the case of global solidarity levies, the only innovation required is ambitious leadership across a sufficient base of countries. Let the tenth anniversary of the Paris climate agreement next year be remembered as the moment when we came together as a global community to implement solidarity levies, providing the financial tools necessary to meet the great challenge of our time. Friederike Roder, at Global Citizen, said: \u201cThese levies offer the most effective means of achieving a step change in grant financing in the short term and providing support to the poorest and most indebted countries. The new report from the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force demonstrates not only the technical feasibility of a number of levies and their revenue potential but also the political momentum behind them.\u201d Wild excitement at the news that the world famous footballer Ronaldinho has been seen at Cop29. In fact it looks as if he may have been there yesterday. Baku TV reported his exciting visit, as he descended from his private jet and shook lots of peoples\u2019 hands. Apparently this is NOT his first visit to Azerbaijan. He has been before, and was in discussions about setting up his own sports academy there. Yes, it\u2019s Cop29 live for all your hottest sports news and gossip. Meanwhile further west, members of the European Parliament have voted to postpone a landmark deforestation law this afternoon, even as its negotiators at Cop29 push for stronger action to stop the planet from heating. The shift is set to delay stricter rules on deforestation that could help save trees around the world, giving bis businesses until the end of 2025 and small businesses until July 2026 to comply with the rules. Climate groups reacted with anger to the vote. Global Witness, which estimates the delayed adoption could deforest an area more than fourteen times the size of Paris, said the European Parliament had \u201ctaken a chainsaw\u201d to the deforestation law. Greenpeace said the move was \u201cabsolutely shameful\u201d. WWF took aim at the European People\u2019s Party, the centre-right grouping that had previously supported the law, for choosing \u201cpolitical posturing over climate action.\u201d The law aims to fight climate breakdown and the death of nature by stopping deforestation related to the EU\u2019s consumption of food and other goods. It covers products such as beef, cocoa, coffee, palm oil and paper. Campaigners also criticised the introduction of a new category of countries posing \u201cno risk\u201d on deforestation, which the Parliament says will face \u201csignificantly less stringent\u201d rules. They fear the loophole could result in high-risk countries exporting their products via low-risk countries, bringing products produced through the felling or burning of forests into the hands of consumers in Europe. Anke Schulmeister-Oldenhove, from the European branch of WWF, said: \u201cToday\u2019s decision also undermines voters\u2019 trust in EU policy-making as a whole, and sends a shameful signal on the climate agenda of the new European Parliament during the ongoing climate negotiations in Baku.\u201d The European Parliament said the delay would help operators around the world implement the law smoothly, and without undermining its objectives. Global Witness, Greenpeace and WWF have called on the European Commission to withdraw the proposal altogether. China is going through the longest summer on record, according to China Daily. \u201cAs of Wednesday, Guangzhou had broken a three-decade heat record, having experienced 235 summer days as measured by temperature. The city experienced a total of 234 hot days in 1994, it said. Guangzhou, which entered its warm temperature period on March 23, usually starts cooling around Nov 9. Based on current temperatures, the province still does not have autumn conditions, and so summer this year will continue, meteorologists said. Meanwhile typhoons continue to roam through the region. The all-important text on the climate finance goal was described on Thursday as \u201ca workable basis for discussion for the first time in the three years of the technical process,\u201d by Yalchin Rafiyev, Cop29\u2019s lead negotiator and Azerbaijan\u2019s deputy minister of foreign affairs. That is not what many countries think, with some describing it as the opposite, as the Guardian pointed out. The task of producing an acceptable text to take in the second week of Cop29, when the hardball high-level negotiating takes place, is critical to delivering the funding desperately needed by developing nations to cope with the worsening impacts of global heating. Key disagreements are on the total finance number and how much is from public money, loans and private finance. \u201cOf course, there are some diverging views and there are some points that still need to find a convergence zone,\u201d Rafiyev said \u201cWith some revisions and some streamlining this text should be a starting point. The text currently on the table is the product of three years of hard work in an inclusive process. There is no alternative to this text and everybody understands that.\u201d Rafiyev was also asked about Argentina\u2019s delegation being withdrawn from Cop29 by its far-right President Javier Milei, who has called climate change a \u201csocialist lie\u201d. He said this was a \u201cbilateral matter\u201d between the UN and Argentina and would not comment further. Rafiyev faced another question about France\u2019s top French climate official Agn\u00e8s Pannier-Runacher cancelling her attendance at Cop29. This happened after Azerbaijan president Ilham Aliyev accused France of \u201cbrutally\u201d suppressing climate change concerns in its Pacific island territories and claiming the \u201cregime of President Macron\u201d had killed citizens protesting legitimately in New Caledonia. France has supported Armenia in its conflict against Azerbaijan, but countries hosting Cops are expected to put aside such bilateral disagreements in order to act as neutral brokers in the negotiations. \u201cWe have opened our doors to everybody and our doors are still open,\u201d said the apparently unflappable Rafiyev. A new report from Global Witness has found that 880,000 people in COP29 host Azerbaijan live within 5km of a gas flaring site. This means that more than one in every 12 Azeri is exposed to powerful pollutants from flaring that can lead to serious medical problems, including asthma, premature birth, heart failure, cancer and strokes. In 2023, the WHO attributed more than one in five deaths from heart disease and stroke in Azerbaijan to air pollution. Read the full report here. Many countries are offering treats at their Cop29 pavilions, writes our colleague Dharna Noor: the UK\u2019s has a coffee bar; Georgia\u2019s last night served wine samples. But no pavilion\u2019s offerings can top the Russian Federation\u2019s. There, passerbys can pick up a coloring book produced by the Russian majority state-owned gas company \u2014 yes, really. Its cover deems it full of \u201cecological coloring for children,\u201d and it\u2019s full of tips on how to promote environmental sustainability, including uplifting the \u201csafety and environmental friendiness of fuel stations.\u201d Other pages encourage children to \u201cplant trees and flowers\u201d and or urges them not to \u201cthrow away batteries and lightbulbs, recycle them.\u201d Thank you for the advice, dear multinational gas producer. (And a hat tip to climate diplomacy tracker extraordinaire Ed King for the tip!) Gazprom isn\u2019t the only gas company that has advertised to children via coloring books. Here\u2019s a US instance from 2011 Hallo, this is Bibi van der Zee, taking over the liveblog from my esteemed colleague Matthew Taylor for the next few hours at Cop29. Please send your thoughts and suggestions my way, at bibi.vanderzee@theguardian.com. Germany\u2019s climate envoy Jennifer Morgan has called China\u2019s climate finance contributions in recent years \u201can important mini-step.\u201d Repeating calls from rich countries to widen the pool of contributors, Morgan called for a new approach to climate finance. She pointed to a statement from China\u2019s vice-premier, Ding Xuexiang, who told world leaders on Tuesday that China has stumped up RMB 177 billion ($24.5 billion) to support other country\u2019s climate efforts since 2016. The sum works out at about $3 billion per year. \u201cThis is an important mini-step,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cBut it remains open exactly which flows of money are counted here - and the quality of the financing is at the moment unclear.\u201d She added: \u201cIt shows China can do a lot, and is already doing something. But only that which is transparent can be recognised.\u201d Poor countries need $1 trillion a year in climate finance by 2030, five years earlier than rich countries are likely to agree to at UN climate talks. That was the finding of a study published this morning that my colleague Fiona Harvey has broken down for you here. At a previous Cop in 2009, rich countries made and then broke a promise to mobilise a tenth of that amount by 2020, meeting the target for the first year in 2022. They have pushed back against efforts to contribute more money unless rich oil countries in the Middle East and China also chip in. Climate activist groups at Cop29 are linking the war in Gaza to the climate crisis \u2013 arguing that western governments and big oil are driving both, with dire consequences for humanity. Asad Rehman, executive director of War on Want which is part of the demand climate justice coalition, told a panel in Baku: \u201cWe stand at a crossroads with the very future of humanity at stake, facing a life or death struggle for humanity: on the one side the right of everyone to live with dignity or a world of walls and fences and sacrificed people,\u201d he said. Josh Gabbatiss, from Carbon Brief has published an update on social media about where negotiations at Cop29 have got to. You may have seen talk of new texts about the climate finance negotiations doing the rounds. These proposals have been produced by the co-chairs and circulated among negotiators and civil society observers, but for some reason they are not being published on the UNFCCC website. I\u2019ve explained what\u2019s going on in this thread: https://x.com/Josh_Gabbatiss/status/1856939519347511393 https://bsky.app/profile/joshgabbatiss.bsky.social/post/3lav6l4xtyk2u In short, developing countries unanimously rejected the slimline 9-page text put together by the co-chairs on Tuesday (and many developed countries were not happy about it either). They asked the co-chairs to produce a new text that accounted for everyone\u2019s suggestions. The result, predictably, is a text that ballooned from 9 pages to 34 pages. Last night, there was hope that the co-chairs would be given a mandate by parties to significantly cut this text in order to make it more manageable. Instead, parties asked them to cut some of the flab, but not to add or remove anything substantial. The result is a text that is just one page shorter. Negotiations are currently on-going\u2026 If delegates want evidence of the reality of the climate crisis they only need to look at Spain, which has been hit by catastrophic flooding for the second time in two weeks. More than 200 people have been killed and the anger towards politicians for their perceived failure to protect the public should serve as a warning to the leaders negotiating at Cop29. My colleague Jonathan Watts has written a piece today looking at the likely impact of Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US on the climate crisis. He warns that the ecological crisis created the setting for Trump\u2019s economy-first, doomsday bunker win \u2013 and it\u2019s the global south that will suffer most Away from the sterile corridors of Cop29 the BBC has a story which offers a good reminder of the wonder of the natural world. It reports that the world\u2019s biggest coral \u2013 larger than a blue whale \u2013 has been recorded in the Pacific Ocean. Manu San Felix, a videographer working on a National Geographic ship in the remote parts of the Pacific, said it was like seeing a \u201ccathedral underwater\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s very emotional. I felt this huge respect for something that\u2019s stayed in one place and survived for hundreds of years,\u201d he said. \u201cMake polluters pay\u201d is the banner festooned across the terraces of the huge football stadium that is at the heart of the Cop29 conference on Thursday. Its target is rich nations, whose enormous emissions now and in the past have created the climate crisis. Instead of football chants, the campaigners are calling for the trillions of dollars of climate finance needed by developing countries to curb the devastating impacts they did little to cause. \u201cWe are calling to all developed countries to take responsibility,\u201d says Sandra Guzman, from Mexico and at the Climate Finance Group for Latin America and the Caribbean, who is at her 16th Cop. \u201cThey have to pay up for their historical responsibilities.\u201d Agreeing a new figure for the annual climate finance, called the \u201cnew collective quantified goal\u201d is the key task of Cop29 and negotiations will be fierce between the rich nations with responsibility to pay and the poor ones needing the money. \u201cThis NCQG is a matter of survival, because this is the only goal on climate finance that we will get,\u201d said Guzman. She says the money needs to be grants, not loans. Private sector finance might be able to deliver renewable energy projects but she says it cannot provide the infrastructure that is needed to protect communities from heatwaves, floods and storms: \u201cYou cannot make profit out of adaptation.\u201d Another problem is that there is no agreed definition of climate finance, meaning that what exactly makes up the existing $100bn a year flow is opaque. Cop29 may or may not agree a definition, but at the very least it has to exclude some projects, she says: \u201cSome countries are saying that gas investments are climate finance, because they have less emissions than coal. But gas is still a fossil fuel.\u201d Away from the Cop negotiations fossil fuel giant Shell was celebrating earlier this week when when it won an appeal against a landmark climate judgment that had ruled it must limit its emissions. But my as my colleague Isabella Kaminski reports the decision does not spell the end of climate litigation against the big companies driving the climate crisis. As negotiators get down to business this morning my colleague Ajit Niranjan has a sobering report which reveals that current policies would lead to a disastrous 2.7C of warming. This would cause a level of disruption that many scientists say will put human civilisation at risk. It adds that the expected level of global heating by the end of the century has not changed since 2021, with \u201cminimal progress\u201d made this year, according to the Climate Action Tracker project. Here is more on the story about how much poorer nations will need in to cope with the escalating impact of the climate crisis, by my colleague Fiona Harvey. She reports that the Independent High-Level Expert Group on Climate Finance, a group of leading economists, say $1tn will be needed by 2030 \u2013 five years earlier than previously suggested. The huge challenge now will be getting richer nations to pay up. Day 4 of Cop promises to be quieter, with world leaders flying home after their Tuesday and Wednesday speeches. Events today will focus on climate finance \u2014 the key issue for the negotiations. Parties are working to broker a deal ensuring developing countries receive funding to help cope with climate disasters and phase out fossil fuels. It\u2019s urgent, since a 2009 agreement to contribute $100 billion annually \u2014 which was only fulfilled in 2022 \u2014 expires this year. How much money negotiators should commit depends on who you ask. The need could easily top $2tn each year; developing countries are asking for a minimum of $1.3tn. The talks have zeroed in on a goal of at least $1 trillion a year \u2014 about 1% of the global economy \u2014 by 2035. That figure comes from a 2022 paper from the Independent High-Level Expert Group on Climate Finance (IHLEG), a group of leading economists that has advised UN climate negotiations since 2021. The IHLEG will release an update to that report later this morning. Stay tuned, as my colleague Fiona Harvey will have the scoop. Finance negotiations in Cop29 are fraught, and tensions are generally high. France\u2019s ecology minister yesterday canceled her flight to Baku after Azerbaijan\u2019s president railed against France for its colonial \u201ccrimes\u201d in its overseas territories. Argentina\u2019s president Javier Milei ordered his team home from the negotiations. And concerns about Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to exit the Paris climate agreement are rampant. Yesterday, Barbados prime minister Mia Mottley \u2014 a climate justice champion and a bit of a UN climate talks celebrity \u2014 invited Donald Trump to a face-to-face meeting to seek \u201ccommon ground\u201d on the climate crisis. \u201cLet us find a common purpose in saving the planet and saving livelihoods,\u201d she told my colleague Fiona Harvey. \u201cWe are human beings and we have the capacity to meet face-to-face, in spite of our differences. We want humanity to survive.\u201d Good morning, this is Matthew Taylor, your online guide to Cop29 for today, the fourth day of the climate summit.

      "body": "<p>One of China\u2019s biggest cities is still officially in summer, despite it being mid-November, as temperatures have failed to drop below the threshold considered necessary to mark the change in season.</p> <p>This week, Guangzhou, a hot and humid city of nearly 19 million people in southern China\u2019s Guangdong province, broke a three-decade heat record, according to the local meteorological service. As of Wednesday the city had experienced 235 summer days, beating 1994\u2019s 234-day season.</p> <p>Guangdong\u2019s meteorological service pegs the change of seasons to the temperature, not the calendar date. Autumn is considered to start when the five-day average temperature is lower than 22C. The season generally begins around 9 November, but temperatures are forecast to stay at summer levels until at least 18 November, according to a statement published on the provincial government\u2019s WeChat account. This year, summer began on 23 March.</p> <p>Ai Hui, a senior engineer at the Guangzhou Climate and Agricultural Meteorological Centre, was quoted in Chinese state media as saying the reason for the long summer was that pressure from the Siberian high, a massive collection of cold dry air that affects weather patterns in the northern hemisphere, was unusually weak this year. That meant less cold wind had been blowing through Guangzhou. The city\u2019s average temperature is currently 24.9C, 1.2C higher than historical averages.</p> <p>In April, Guangzhou was hit by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/29/china-extreme-weather-guangzhou-tornado-death-toll-damage-floods\">a tornado</a> that killed at least five people and injured dozens.

      "bodyText": "One of China\u2019s biggest cities is still officially in summer, despite it being mid-November, as temperatures have failed to drop below the threshold considered necessary to mark the change in season. This week, Guangzhou, a hot and humid city of nearly 19 million people in southern China\u2019s Guangdong province, broke a three-decade heat record, according to the local meteorological service. As of Wednesday the city had experienced 235 summer days, beating 1994\u2019s 234-day season. Guangdong\u2019s meteorological service pegs the change of seasons to the temperature, not the calendar date. Autumn is considered to start when the five-day average temperature is lower than 22C. The season generally begins around 9 November, but temperatures are forecast to stay at summer levels until at least 18 November, according to a statement published on the provincial government\u2019s WeChat account. This year, summer began on 23 March. Ai Hui, a senior engineer at the Guangzhou Climate and Agricultural Meteorological Centre, was quoted in Chinese state media as saying the reason for the long summer was that pressure from the Siberian high, a massive collection of cold dry air that affects weather patterns in the northern hemisphere, was unusually weak this year. That meant less cold wind had been blowing through Guangzhou. The city\u2019s average temperature is currently 24.9C, 1.2C higher than historical averages. In April, Guangzhou was hit by a tornado that killed at least five people and injured dozens. The province has also experienced severe flooding. Extreme weather events have become more common across China in recent years, with droughts, floods and heatwaves putting strain on the infrastructure, especially electricity grids. Analysis has found that human-caused climate breakdown is supercharging extreme weather across the world, driving more frequent and more deadly disasters, from heatwaves to floods to wildfires. At least a dozen of the most serious events of the last decade would have been all but impossible without human-caused global heating. In 2022, a long-running heatwave pushed electricity use to record levels in cities across China, including Guangzhou, as people and businesses used their air conditioning units at maximum levels in an effort to stay cool. This triggered major power outages. China\u2019s leaders have since become extremely concerned about energy security, which analysts worry is slowing down the country\u2019s process of weaning itself off coal. China\u2019s record-breaking installation of renewable energy has been regarded as one of the more optimistic developments in relation to global action on climate change.",

But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/nov/22/best-black-friday-deals-2024\">Black Friday</a>, which falls on 29 November this year, is now as much a British autumn staple as Strictly.</p> <p>The cost of living crisis has played a part in boosting Black Friday\u2019s popularity in the UK. <a href=\"https://store.mintel.com/report/uk-black-friday-market-report\">More than half of shoppers now rely on discounts because of financial concerns</a>, according to Mintel \u2013 and Black Friday is about nothing if not finding discounts. It has replaced Boxing Day and January as the top bargain-hunting bonanza of the year, with sales up 7.3% year on year.</p> <p>On Black Friday 2023, UK shoppers spent an estimated \u00a313.3bn in an attempt to \u2026 save money. Therein lies the irony of sales. The spectacle of people fighting over stuff they wouldn\u2019t normally want is why retailers love Black Friday even more than customers do. To win this game, you must know what you want, and whether it\u2019s a real bargain.

It\u2019s impossible to predict, not least because some retailers including Amazon use dynamic pricing that rises and falls in response to demand, minute by minute.

But Black Friday, which falls on 29 November this year, is now as much a British autumn staple as Strictly. The cost of living crisis has played a part in boosting Black Friday\u2019s popularity in the UK. More than half of shoppers now rely on discounts because of financial concerns, according to Mintel \u2013 and Black Friday is about nothing if not finding discounts. It has replaced Boxing Day and January as the top bargain-hunting bonanza of the year, with sales up 7.3% year on year. On Black Friday 2023, UK shoppers spent an estimated \u00a313.3bn in an attempt to \u2026 save money. Therein lies the irony of sales. The spectacle of people fighting over stuff they wouldn\u2019t normally want is why retailers love Black Friday even more than customers do. To win this game, you must know what you want, and whether it\u2019s a real bargain. That means doing your research now. Here are some practical tips and psychological tricks to find the best price for any product, be first in the queue for bargains, check whether a discount is legit \u2013 and stop yourself going rogue.

Disparities that go beyond smoking have been revealed by the University of Oxford researchers\u2019 analysis of 17.5 million people\u2019s health records and 84,000 lung cancer cases. The findings, from Oxford\u2019s Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, coincide with the rollout of the targeted lung health check programme across England, which aims to reach 40% of the eligible population by March 2025 and 100% by 2030. The new research found \u201cethnic background and social circumstances\u201d are crucial factors in cancer risk, how it develops, and the type. Lung cancer occurred twice as frequently in the most deprived areas compared with the least \u2013 with 215 cases per 100,000 people among men in the poorest areas, compared with 94 cases in the most affluent, the study found. For women, rates in the most deprived areas were at 147 per 100,000, compared with 62 in the least deprived. Bangladeshi men showed the highest lung cancer rates, followed by white, Chinese and Caribbean men. Women and people from Indian, Caribbean, Black African, Chinese and other Asian backgrounds were twice as likely to be diagnosed with adenocarcinoma, one of the most common types of lung cancer, said the paper, titled Ethnic disparities in lung cancer incidence and differences in diagnostic characteristics: a population-based cohort study in England, published in the Lancet Regional Health \u2013 Europe. The study, spanning 2005 to 2019, adds to existing research that suggests disparities in lung cancer could be influenced by genetic predisposition and class as well as habits. Dr Daniel Tzu-Hsuan Chen, who led the research, said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about smoking: our research shows that ethnic background and social circumstances play crucial roles in both cancer risk and how the disease develops.\u201d Among those who developed lung cancer, people from deprived areas had a 35% higher risk of being diagnosed with more aggressive forms. The study found men and current smokers were more likely to be diagnosed at later stages than women and non-smokers. In June last year, the then Conservative government announced the rollout of the targeted lung cancer screening programme, aimed at early detection and prevention across England. It involves people aged 55 to 74, registered with GPs and with a known history of smoking, assessed and invited for screenings and smoking cessation services, aiming to save thousands of lives and slash the cost to the NHS of late-stage treatment. It follows a pilot, beginning in 2019, in which 900,000 people in parts of England were invited for checks, with more than 2,000 detected as having cancer and 76% of lung cancers caught early, compared with 29% before it began. During the programme, screening took place in mobile units in places such as supermarket car parks, focusing on deprived neighbourhoods where people are four times more likely to smoke. The Oxford researchers hope that, by highlighting how healthcare access, ethnicity and class affect cancer outcomes, their findings will help ensure checks reach those most at risk as the rollout continues. Prof Julia Hippisley-Cox, a senior author of the study, said: \u201cWe need to ensure our cancer services are reaching all communities effectively and that everyone has the same opportunity for early diagnosis. \u201cTackling these disparities isn\u2019t just about lung cancer: when we address these fundamental inequalities in healthcare access and social deprivation, we can improve health outcomes across many conditions.\u201d",

Keith Asman, the head of forensics and digital investigations for the police\u2019s south-east region counter-terrorism unit, told the inquiry into the Wiltshire poisonings that officers combed the area around Skripal\u2019s house for a small container of novichok and for discarded protective clothing the attackers may have used. Asman said police were conscious that a member of the public \u2013 perhaps a child \u2013 could have picked up a bottle of novichok left behind after a dose of it was applied to Skripal\u2019s front door handle. But he said: \u201cWe were searching for a needle in a haystack. We didn\u2019t know what the needle looked like or where the haystack was or if it was even in the country.

Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, fell ill after being contaminated by novichok apparently applied to the front door handle of his home in Salisbury by Russian agents in March 2018. They survived but four months later, Dawn Sturgess died after spraying novichok over herself that had been contained in a fake perfume bottle. Her boyfriend, Charlie Rowley, has said he found the bottle in a charity shop bin in Salisbury.

The transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said she wanted \u201call passengers to feel confident when they fly\u201d and would introduce changes to \u201cprovide air travellers with the highest level of protection possible\u201d. Her comments came after an investigation into the severe disruption caused across UK airports on 28 August last year after National Air Traffic Services (Nats) experienced a technical glitch while processing a flight plan. Hundreds of flights were grounded on one of the busiest travel days of the year, which resulted in more than 300,000 passengers having flights cancelled, and nearly 400,000 facing delays of at least three hours. The report found that despite the delays, and travellers having to book on other flights at significant cost, many waited \u201cmany weeks, or in some cases months\u201d for airlines to refund them, with some still not being fully reimbursed. In one case, a passenger said they incurred costs totalling \u00a3900 for accommodation, taxis, food and clothing as a result of the delays but were offered a refund only to the value of the original flight. The report recommended that the regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), is given the power to \u201ctake consumer enforcement action\u201d without going through the courts. This could include the ability to issue fines, which would align it with regulators in some other sectors. The CAA\u2019s inability to issue fines means it is required to take airlines to court if they fail to respond to enforcement action, which means short-term resolutions are unlikely. The report called for more resources to be given to the regulator for consumer rights enforcement and for the body to step in more readily in response to flagrant breaches, rather than the current system, in which it intervened only in response to recurring breaches. Haigh said: \u201cI welcome the final report and its recommendations to strengthen the sector and restore passenger confidence. I\u2019ve said before that I will be the passenger-in-chief and my priority is to ensure all passengers feel confident when they fly. \u201cThat\u2019s why my department will look to introduce reforms, when we can, to provide air travellers with the highest level of protection possible.\u201d Under the Conservative government, in June last year the department for transport set out plans to give the CAA \u201cstronger enforcement powers\u201d, but no legislation to support that was introduced. The investigation spoke of an overwhelming lack of information provided to passengers over the nature of delays, as well as their rights around compensation from airlines. It also highlighted the emotional affect the disruption had had on some travellers, including anxiety around when families could return home or if passengers would run out of medication. In one case, a passenger with Crohn\u2019s disease received an email saying her package holiday had been cancelled \u2013 when she was already at the resort. Despite spending four days trying to get through to her airline and tour operator she never received an update, ruining her holiday as she feared she could be ejected at any time. The report recommended that airlines and airports review the \u201cadequacy\u201d of the support available to passengers during significant disruption, in particular vulnerable passengers or those travelling with children. In total, 34 recommendations were made by the inquiry, which was set up by the CAA and led by Jeff Halliwell, who has served as a chief executive and non-executive director in roles across the private and public sector. Halliwell said: \u201cThe incident on 28 August 2023 represented a major failure on the part of the air traffic control system, which caused considerable distress to over 700,000 aviation passengers, and resulted in substantial costs to airlines and airports.\u201d A NATS spokesperson said: \u201cWe welcome the final report from the independent review that the CAA commissioned, and the recommendations regarding the events of August 2023. \u201cWe cooperated fully with the independent review panel throughout their process.

Strange as that may sound, this visual cue often sets the rest in motion: a wide ceramic platter for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/aug/21/turkish-lamb-ezme-corn-dogs-grilled-corn-soy-tahini-butter-yotam-ottolenghi-holiday-recipes\">grilled lamb chops with ezme, yoghurt and cumin salt</a>, say, or for a generous mound of lentils and chickpeas dotted with nuts and barberries. A splash of green here, a pop of orange there, maybe a touch of purple for contrast \u2026</p> <p>I don\u2019t expect everyone to kick off their meal prep by picking out the tableware, but for me it can be the first spark of creativity. This week, I chatted with my test kitchen colleagues, who have <em>serious</em> form at feeding crowds, to pin down a few practical steps for achieving a manageable spread without leaving a mountain of cleaning up.</p> <p><em><strong>Start with the centrepiece<br></strong></em>You need only one dish that will grab everyone\u2019s attention and make them go: \u201cOoh!\u201d Think <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/19/yotam-ottolenghi-barbecue-recipes\">blackened sea bass</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/apr/13/yotam-ottolenghi-easter-recipes-devilled-eggs-rice-lamb-chicken-chocolate-orange-bread\">celebration rice</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/01/boulangere-lamb-roast-pepper-salad-semlor-buns-yotam-ottolenghi-easter-recipes\">roast lamb shoulder</a>. Once you have your centrepiece, round it out with simple sides such as <a href=\"https://ottolenghi.co.uk/pages/recipes/roast-potatoes-green-sauce-tahini\">roast potatoes with green sauce and tahini</a> or some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/24/easy-ottolenghi-autumn-salads-side-dishes-recipes\">leafy greens</a>. Just one knockout main and a few delicious accompaniments is more than enough to keep your guests happy. (Bonus points if the main event can be popped in the oven in the morning and taken straight to the table at dinner time.)</p> <p><em><strong>Prep as much as possible<br></strong></em>Take care of the small stuff in advance. Marinate the meat, chop the vegetables, make sauces, toast nuts. Anything that can be done the day before should be. Knowing what needs doing and when will help you dodge that last-minute scramble.</p> <p><em><strong>Serve family</strong></em><em><strong> style</strong></em><br>Skip the formality and put on a spread of shareable dishes, so people serve themselves. It\u2019s also helpful to choose a theme to pull everything together \u2013 for instance, a big plate of juicy birria beef in the centre with a charred corn salsa and a coriander crema alongside. This approach not only helps bring people together, it also saves on the washing-up.</p> <p><em><strong>Don\u2019t </strong></em><em><strong>be a martyr</strong></em><br>You might think you can pull off a feast alone, but a little help goes a long way. Get someone else to do the grocery run, pick up the bread or wrangle with any little ones while you get on with the prep. Once there\u2019s a crowd around you, being the cook becomes easier \u2013 most people will either want to lend a hand (in which case give them a lemon to zest) or to give you the space to focus. And remember, whoever does the shopping also doubles up as the dishwasher!</p> <p><em><strong>Clean as you go</strong></em><br>It\u2019s tempting to toss dirty teaspoons into the sink and leave them there for later, but resist the urge if you can. Wipe and rinse your spoons and knives as you go, and use a big bowl as a tabletop bin for tossing your scraps into. These small steps will make a world of difference when it comes to cleaning up.</p> <p><em><strong>Keep snacks in easy reach</strong></em><br>To keep hungry guests out of the kitchen, set out a few simple snacks in a different space: a bowl of olives, some <a href=\"https://ottolenghi.co.uk/pages/recipes/spicy-nuts\">spiced nuts</a> or a plate of crudit\u00e9s with as many dips as you can whip up \u2013 perhaps a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/02/dips-spreads-recipes-spinach-butterbean-red-pepper-avocado-lentil-yotam-ottolenghi\">butter bean mash with walnuts or spiced red lentil dip with curry leaves</a>. Snacks that don\u2019t require any attention are a host\u2019s best friend.</p> <p>With just one standout dish, a bit of advance prep and some unexacting snacks, hosting can become slightly less stressful. Take the help that\u2019s offered, prepare what you can \u2013 and don\u2019t forget the crisps (or olives or nuts).</p> <h2>My week in food</h2>    <p><em><strong>Hidden bistro</strong></em><strong> | </strong>Our test kitchen head,<strong> </strong>Milli Taylor, tipped me off about a new spot in north London called <a href=\"https://www.bollandandcrust.com/\">Bolland &amp; Crust</a>.

Apparent highlights include a Reuben sandwich and barbecued lamb, and I can\u2019t wait to get there.</p> <p><em><strong>What I\u2019ve been cooking</strong></em><strong> | </strong>A recent half-term favourite for my kids was a large <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/sep/10/peppered-chicken-confit-aubergine-preserved-figs-recipes-yotam-ottolenghi-preserving-summer-fruit-and-vegetables\">Dutch baby pancake</a> (I leave out the sugar in this recipe), with condiments sweet and savoury for everyone to choose from. At our house you\u2019ll find the table laid with chocolate spread, fresh fruit, jam, yoghurt, crisp bacon, smoked salmon and cheese. The best way to serve this pancake is with a pair of large kitchen scissors, to cut big wedges for everyone.</p> <p><em><strong>Condiment Claire to the rescue</strong></em><strong> | </strong>A colleague recently recommended I pick up <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-condiment-book-9781526669780/\">The Condiment Book by Claire Dinhut</a>, and I\u2019m very glad I did.

      "body": "<p><strong>Did you think Don\u2019t Speak would become such a huge hit?</strong> <em>Troy_McClure</em><br>I absolutely had no idea. It didn\u2019t even represent what we were doing, because No Doubt were such an uptempo, live-energy band. Even the guitar solo has no business being in that song. The original version was written by my brother [Eric, keyboards], who lived at my grandparents\u2019 house; after they passed away, it became the band house. He\u2019d stay up all night eating peanut butter sandwiches, drinking milk and smoking cigarettes and go: \u201cOh, I wrote this last night.\u201d</p> <p>Then I ended up rewriting the lyrics and changing the whole song because Tony [Kanal, bass] broke up with me. It\u2019s crazy, but that song really is the heartbeat of who I am and changed everything. After it came out, we were driving through Israel and these guards came up to the van with guns, which I\u2019d never seen anywhere before. One of them looked in the van and started singing Don\u2019t Speak to me. That soon became normal.</p> <p><strong>No Doubt covered Talk Talk\u2019s </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubvV498pyIM\"><strong>It\u2019s My Life</strong></a><strong> after considering a version of the INXS song Don\u2019t Change. Is there a studio version of that song gathering dust?</strong> <em>McScootikins</em><br>No. We never recorded it. My memory is like the movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/28/finding-dory-review-pixar-nemo-ellen-degeneres\">Finding Dory</a> \u2013 everything erases! \u2013 but I do remember sitting with the band on [label boss] Jimmy Iovine\u2019s little outdoor patio, talking about doing a cover. The rest of the band were against it, but we all thought It\u2019s My Life would be OK. Even though I didn\u2019t write the song, it\u2019s very much my story \u2013 like it was written for me.</p>    <p><strong>What did Talk Talk\u2019s </strong><strong>Mark Hollis</strong><strong> think of the No Doubt version? Did you get to meet him?</strong> <em>stephenw1979</em><br>I didn\u2019t. I think he probably thought: thanks for the cheque, because he got paid twice. I don\u2019t know what they thought of our version, but I\u2019d be so happy if anyone covered any of our songs. It\u2019s such a compliment and gives the song a new life.</p> <p><strong>What can you tell us about your </strong><strong>Space Pants Saturday Night Live sketch? </strong><em>Segelov</em><br>Behind the scenes on that show is incredible. They come up with many more skits than they need and I shot a bunch of stuff that never came out. When I got asked to be on Space Pants, I was super nervous, because I\u2019m not an actor and I\u2019m a slow learner and live TV is hard. I was convinced I\u2019d&nbsp;forget my lyrics, but I didn\u2019t mess up and it was super fun. I loved the way the song rhymed \u201cfinale\u201d with \u201cStefani\u201d. I&nbsp;still have the pants in my closet.</p>    <p><strong>What was it like in the early days in California with all those up-and-coming ska punk bands like Sublime? Do you miss </strong><strong>Bradley Nowell</strong><strong>? </strong><strong>Are you in contact with his son, who has taken over from his father as lead singer?</strong> <em>scroogemcgrew</em><br>It was a really exciting time in Orange County when all the UK ska stuff like the Specials, Madness and the Selecter was super underground in America and really inspired us. We ended up on the same bills with Sublime because we had the same vibe. Bradley was one of those people you meet that have a halo around them. He was super soulful with so much talent. It was devastating when his life was cut short [by a heroin overdose in 1996]. I do know his son. It was such a tiny part of my life, but I still get asked about it all the time because that band made such an impact. I\u2019m happy for Bradley. I&nbsp;wish he was still here.</p>    <p><strong>You mentioned once that you have seen wild and even traumatic things around you in the music industry. Do you want to address darker subjects in lyrics? </strong><em>alex111111</em><br>I don\u2019t remember saying that, but I feel like I\u2019ve had like a blessed experience. I was very naive and people say: \u201cOh, you were a female in the industry,\u201d but I always had a voice and people wanted my opinions.

      "bodyText": "Did you think Don\u2019t Speak would become such a huge hit? Troy_McClure I absolutely had no idea. It didn\u2019t even represent what we were doing, because No Doubt were such an uptempo, live-energy band. Even the guitar solo has no business being in that song. The original version was written by my brother [Eric, keyboards], who lived at my grandparents\u2019 house; after they passed away, it became the band house. He\u2019d stay up all night eating peanut butter sandwiches, drinking milk and smoking cigarettes and go: \u201cOh, I wrote this last night.\u201d Then I ended up rewriting the lyrics and changing the whole song because Tony [Kanal, bass] broke up with me. It\u2019s crazy, but that song really is the heartbeat of who I am and changed everything. After it came out, we were driving through Israel and these guards came up to the van with guns, which I\u2019d never seen anywhere before. One of them looked in the van and started singing Don\u2019t Speak to me. That soon became normal. No Doubt covered Talk Talk\u2019s It\u2019s My Life after considering a version of the INXS song Don\u2019t Change. Is there a studio version of that song gathering dust? McScootikins No. We never recorded it. My memory is like the movie Finding Dory \u2013 everything erases! \u2013 but I do remember sitting with the band on [label boss] Jimmy Iovine\u2019s little outdoor patio, talking about doing a cover. The rest of the band were against it, but we all thought It\u2019s My Life would be OK. Even though I didn\u2019t write the song, it\u2019s very much my story \u2013 like it was written for me. What did Talk Talk\u2019s Mark Hollis think of the No Doubt version? Did you get to meet him? stephenw1979 I didn\u2019t. I think he probably thought: thanks for the cheque, because he got paid twice. I don\u2019t know what they thought of our version, but I\u2019d be so happy if anyone covered any of our songs. It\u2019s such a compliment and gives the song a new life. What can you tell us about your Space Pants Saturday Night Live sketch? Segelov Behind the scenes on that show is incredible. They come up with many more skits than they need and I shot a bunch of stuff that never came out. When I got asked to be on Space Pants, I was super nervous, because I\u2019m not an actor and I\u2019m a slow learner and live TV is hard. I was convinced I\u2019d forget my lyrics, but I didn\u2019t mess up and it was super fun. I loved the way the song rhymed \u201cfinale\u201d with \u201cStefani\u201d. I still have the pants in my closet. What was it like in the early days in California with all those up-and-coming ska punk bands like Sublime? Do you miss Bradley Nowell? Are you in contact with his son, who has taken over from his father as lead singer? scroogemcgrew It was a really exciting time in Orange County when all the UK ska stuff like the Specials, Madness and the Selecter was super underground in America and really inspired us. We ended up on the same bills with Sublime because we had the same vibe. Bradley was one of those people you meet that have a halo around them. He was super soulful with so much talent. It was devastating when his life was cut short [by a heroin overdose in 1996]. I do know his son. It was such a tiny part of my life, but I still get asked about it all the time because that band made such an impact. I\u2019m happy for Bradley. I wish he was still here. You mentioned once that you have seen wild and even traumatic things around you in the music industry. Do you want to address darker subjects in lyrics? alex111111 I don\u2019t remember saying that, but I feel like I\u2019ve had like a blessed experience. I was very naive and people say: \u201cOh, you were a female in the industry,\u201d but I always had a voice and people wanted my opinions. Yes, they sent us back to the drawing board with an eight-track recorder and said: \u201cGo back to your garage and write music.\u201d But that just made us work harder. I have written a lot about my personal darkness. I have been through a lot of suffering, trying to find love, truth and an honest person.

What drew you towards flowers as inspiration for your new album, Bouquet? Kierralanni Meeting my husband [country singer Blake Shelton] felt like a second chance at life, because when my family fell apart [Stefani was married to Bush\u2019s lead singer, Gavin Rossdale, for 12 years; they have three children] it was a catastrophe.

The 14 once-fake-and-now-real electors were selected by state Republican parties in Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Mexico and Nevada. They will meet in their state capitols on 17 December to cast their ballots for Trump. Prosecutors in many of the states where fake electors signed false documents are moving forward with charges, as the federal charges against Trump for election subversion and other alleged crimes are up in the air after his re-election. Five of the seven states pursued charges related to the issue. Authorities in New Mexico and Pennsylvania did not pursue charges because the documents the false electors there used hedged language that attorneys said would likely spare them from criminal charges. The fake electors in some instances are high-profile Republicans: people in elected office, in official party roles, prominent members of external conservative groups. Here\u2019s where the state cases stand. Arizona Kris Mayes, the Democratic attorney general for Arizona, said on Sunday that her office will not be dropping any charges related to the fake electors. A grand jury in Arizona charged 18 people involved in the fake electors scheme, including the 11 people who served as fake electors and Trump allies Mark Meadows, John Eastman, Boris Epshteyn, Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis, Christina Bobb and Mike Roman.

Fake electors David Shafer, Cathleen Latham and Shawn Still were charged in the criminal racketeering case, but not all of the fake electors in Georgia were charged - many were granted immunity to cooperate with the case. The US supreme court rejected an attempt by Meadows on Tuesday to move the case to federal court. The next step is set for December: the Georgia court of appeals will hear arguments on whether prosecutor Fani Willis can continue on the case herself despite a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor on the case. A lower court previous ruled that she could continue. Michigan Sixteen fake electors were charged in Michigan in mid-2023. One of them agreed to cooperate with the prosecution and had his charges dropped in return. The case is working its way through the court process, with the last of the defendants sitting for examinations in October as the judge decides whether the case should go to trial. Six of those charged will serve as Trump\u2019s actual electors this year. Attorneys for those fake and now real electors have said their role this year shouldn\u2019t have any bearing on their legal cases. Nevada Six Trump electors in Nevada were charged at the end of 2023 with state forgery crimes for their roles in the scheme. In June, Clark county district court judge Mary Kay Holthu dismissed the case, saying it was in the wrong venue and should not have been filed in Las Vegas. Democratic attorney general Aaron Ford vowed to appeal the ruling, but defense attorneys have said the charges are now outside the statute of limitations. \u201cMy office\u2019s goal remains unchanged \u2013 we will hold these fake electors accountable for their actions which contributed to the ongoing and completely unfounded current of distrust in our electoral system,\u201d Ford said. \u201cOur drive to seek justice does not change with election results.

This is not going away.\u201d Two of the fake electors will again serve as Trump electors this year: Michael McDonald, the chair of the Nevada Republican party, and Jesse Law, chair of the Republican party of Clark county. Wisconsin The fake elector scheme allegedly began in Wisconsin, where pro-Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro is from. Those who served as fake electors did not get criminally charged in Wisconsin, though three people involved in the scheme \u2013 Chesebro, Roman, and James Troupis \u2013 were charged in June by the state attorney general for their role in orchestrating the scheme. The state\u2019s fake electors settled a civil lawsuit in 2023 that required them to agree not to serve as electors when elections involve Trump and to acknowledge Joe Biden\u2019s victory in 2020.

Her brother and co-producer, Michael G Wilson, added: \u201cEvery time we cast a new actor, the films change. It\u2019s the excitement of a new Bond, a new direction. Every one of these people who took on the role offered something new and different.\u201d Recent rumours have suggested that the Kick-Ass and The Fall Guy actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson is the hot favourite with unconfirmed reports claiming that the 33-year-old has already been offered the role. In 2021, Amazon brought MGM which also secured it the rights to James Bond. The company\u2019s global head, Jennifer Salke, was asked about the future of the franchise in a recent interview with the Observer. \u201cThere are a lot of ideas [about potential actors] that have popped up that I thought are interesting,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there are a lot of different ways we can go \u2026 We are not looking to disrupt the way those wonderful films are made \u2026 The global audience will be patient. We don\u2019t want too much time between films, but we are not concerned at this point.\u201d Last year, Broccoli also confirmed that the films would not become streaming premieres as they are made \u201cfor the big theatrical screen\u201d. Craig\u2019s final appearance as 007 in 2021\u2019s No Time to Die brought in $774m at the worldwide box office. It remains the third-biggest film of all time in the UK. When recently asked who he would choose to take over the role, Craig laughed and said: \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d",

In October, the new Labour government launches an independent review of how carer\u2019s allowance overpayments were allowed to be accrued on such an industrial scale. At the budget it promises to fix the notorious earnings limit \u201ccliff edge\u201d penalties at the heart of the scandal. In November, with Schofield sitting beside her, the welfare secretary, Liz Kendall, tells MPs at a select committee hearing that DWP culture needs to change in respect of its treatment of vulnerable claimants. \u201cWe need to learn from the problems and the mistakes that were made [with carer\u2019s allowance] to make sure they don\u2019t happen again,\u201d she says.",

The president-elect drew laughter from the Republican caucus for his remarks about the possibility of remaining in the White House beyond January 2029, which would be prohibited by the 22nd amendment limiting a commander-in-chief to two four-year terms of office. \u201cI suspect I won\u2019t be running again unless you say, \u2018He\u2019s so good we\u2019ve got to figure something else out\u2019,\u201d said Trump, who incited the deadly January 6 Capitol riot in 2021 to try to cling on to power at the end of his first administration. On Wednesday Dan Goldman, the New York Democratic congressman, said he plans to file a motion this week specifically mentioning Trump and reiterating the two-term clause from an amendment approved by Congress in 1947, two years after Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s four-term, 12-year presidency before and during the second world war ended with his death. A lengthy ratification process was completed in 1951 when 36 of the then 48 states gave their consent to the prohibition of any person who had been elected to the presidency twice from standing again. Goldman\u2019s motion, according to NBC News, which saw a copy, features language highlighting the amendment \u201capplies to two terms in the aggregate as president of the United States\u201d and reaffirms that it \u201capplies to President-elect Trump\u201d. The initiative, first reported by the New York Times, is unlikely to receive a scheduled vote in the House, which was projected on Wednesday to remain in Republican hands under the speakership of Mike Johnson, a vocal ally of the 78-year-old president-elect. But the Democrat could seek to introduce it as a privileged motion, which would guarantee it floor time, a procedural tool previously used to force votes on the ousting of Republican former speaker Kevin McCarthy last year, as well as the expulsion from the House of his fabulist former colleague George Santos. Goldman, the Times said, is attempting to draw attention to a number of \u201canti-democratic and authoritarian\u201d comments Trump has made about staying in the White House in defiance of the constitutional amendment. In July, he repeated an earlier assertion that if he was re-elected in this month\u2019s presidential election \u201cyou won\u2019t have to vote any more. It\u2019ll be fixed so good, you\u2019re not going to have to\u201d. Democrats and other critics called the remarks \u201cterrifying\u201d and interpreted them as a statement that there would be no more elections. In remarks to the National Rifle Association in May, the Times reported, he told his audience: \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know, are we going to be considered three-term or two-term? Are we three-term or two-term if we win?\u2019\u2019, which was a likely reference to his often-repeated \u201cbig lie\u201d that he won the 2020 election. And two days before the 5 November election, during a dark speech in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in which he suggested he would be fine with members of the news media being shot, he said he \u201cshouldn\u2019t have left\u201d the White House after his 2020 defeat to Joe Biden. Despite Republicans having won control of the presidency, both houses of Congress, and the supreme court through Trump\u2019s first-term picks, the incoming president would face an almost insurmountable barrier to modify the term-limit rules and allow him to stand in a fourth consecutive election. Proposed changes to the constitution require a two-thirds majority in both chambers, plus the approval of three-quarters of the states, either through their legislatures or at a constitutional convention. The constitution has been amended 27 times since it was ratified in 1788, most recently in 1992 with a measure preventing lawmakers from setting their own salaries.",

The results suggest that the \u201cgold-standard\u201d treatment they had received, combining artemisinin with a second malaria drug called lumefantrine, was not working as well as it should.</p> <p>John said the study was started after researchers noticed a slow response to treatment in some children who were already being monitored for a project on severe malaria in young patients.</p>    <p>\u201cThe fact that we started seeing evidence of drug resistance before we even started specifically looking for it is a troubling sign,\u201d John said. </p> <p>\u201cWe were further surprised that, after we turned our focus to resistance, we also ended up finding patients who had recurrence after we thought they had been cured.\u201d</p> <p>The study is being presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine &amp; Hygiene in New Orleans, and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. </p> <p>John said it was too early to determine how widespread resistance to artemisinin was in Africa, although there was evidence it was spreading, pointing to studies showing partial resistance in children with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/apr/15/africa-on-the-verge-of-resistance-to-key-malaria-drugs-rwanda-study-warns\">uncomplicated malaria</a> \u2013 a milder form that does not affect organs \u2013 in countries such as Rwanda and Uganda.</p> <p>However, he said: \u201cI think our study is the \u2018canary in the coalmine\u2019 for children with severe malaria.\u201d</p> <p>Resistance to artemisinin therapies emerged <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5424521/#:~:text=Artemisinin%20resistance%20in%20Plasmodium%20falciparum,undermining%20control%20and%20elimination%20efforts.\">earlier in south-east Asia</a>, where the first signs were identified in similar studies.

A study of children being treated in hospital for malaria in Uganda, presented at a major conference on Thursday, found signs of resistance to artemisinin in one patient in 10. Antimicrobial resistance, where pathogens such as parasites, bacteria and fungi develop ways to evade the drugs used to fight them, is a growing global concern. It is forecast to kill more than 39 million people by 2050. Children are the most vulnerable to malaria, with about 450,000 under-5s dying from the disease in sub-Saharan Africa each year. Of the 100 children studied, 11 showed partial resistance to the treatment. All were infected by malaria parasites carrying genetic mutations that have been linked to artemisinin resistance. Dr Chandy John, of Indiana University, who co-wrote the study with international colleagues, said: \u201cThis is the first study from Africa showing that children with malaria and clear signs of severe disease are experiencing at least partial resistance to artemisinin.\u201d A further 10 of the children studied, who were thought to have been cured of infection, suffered a repeat attack from the same strain of malaria within a month. The results suggest that the \u201cgold-standard\u201d treatment they had received, combining artemisinin with a second malaria drug called lumefantrine, was not working as well as it should. John said the study was started after researchers noticed a slow response to treatment in some children who were already being monitored for a project on severe malaria in young patients. \u201cThe fact that we started seeing evidence of drug resistance before we even started specifically looking for it is a troubling sign,\u201d John said. \u201cWe were further surprised that, after we turned our focus to resistance, we also ended up finding patients who had recurrence after we thought they had been cured.\u201d The study is being presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine &amp; Hygiene in New Orleans, and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. John said it was too early to determine how widespread resistance to artemisinin was in Africa, although there was evidence it was spreading, pointing to studies showing partial resistance in children with uncomplicated malaria \u2013 a milder form that does not affect organs \u2013 in countries such as Rwanda and Uganda. However, he said: \u201cI think our study is the \u2018canary in the coalmine\u2019 for children with severe malaria.\u201d Resistance to artemisinin therapies emerged earlier in south-east Asia, where the first signs were identified in similar studies. Treatment failure rates in that region increased when resistance also emerged to drugs used in combination with artemisinin. Dr Richard Pearson, of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, who was not involved in this study, said the situation in east Africa was reminiscent of the situation in south-east Asia 15 years ago. Artemisinin is used in a variety of forms to treat the disease. For children with severe malaria, this consists of an intravenous infusion of artesunate, one derivative of artemisinin, followed by an oral drug combining a second derivative with another antimalarial medicine. Artesunate replaced quinine as the recommended treatment for children with severe malaria more than a decade ago, after a trial showed fewer deaths with the newer drug. \u201cReturning to quinine would be a step backward,\u201d John said. Dr Alena Pance, a senior lecturer in genetics at the University of Hertfordshire, said any indication of resistance to the \u201ccritical drug\u201d was extremely worrying and that high transmission rates in Africa \u201cimposes a dangerous risk of quick spreading of resistance within the continent, making these findings even more alarming\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>After his first day of daycare, my long, stinky son Basil came home with a report card that said he\u2019d been well-behaved but also needed to work on \u201cappropriate play\u201d. As a parent, I decided to take this constructive criticism normally.</p> <p>Initially I was just relieved that Basil hadn\u2019t murdered one of the other attenders of the daycare, which has put me in the weird position of having a lot of empathy for Dexter\u2019s dad.</p> <p>Basil is a dog, a rescue greyhound, trained to chase things for entertainment, and the fear that he might see a small, white, fluffy dog running and tear it to pieces is unfortunately real. Obviously I\u2019d done my due diligence, training and testing him with other dogs in controlled environments before getting to this stage, but the fear persists. Plus, as a newly single dog-parent, I unfortunately didn\u2019t have any other options \u2013 I had to go and work in an office so I could afford his expensive, single-protein diet food, sensitive-skin shampoo and anti-anxiety medication \u2013 which meant he had to go to daycare.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jul/13/pet-hates-whats-it-like-to-dislike-dogs-in-a-dog-loving-country\">Pet hates: what\u2019s it like to dislike dogs in a dog-loving country?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But after the initial relief that my son was not a psychopath, I began to worry that my beautiful dog might be engaged in \u201cinappropriate\u201d play, whatever that was. I imagined it might be something sexually deviant. Luckily the daycare \u2013 appropriately titled Barks and Recreation \u2013 puts footage of the hounds playing on their Instagram stories throughout the day, meaning that while I was meant to be listening carefully in morning meetings and meeting my deadlines, I was digital helicopter parenting, compulsively watching to see exactly what my beloved boy was inappropriately doing.</p> <p>Instead of seeing him compulsively licking other dogs, or pissing on their heads, or gesturing at women to take out their earphones on public transport, I mostly watched Basil linger on the edges of all the frolicking dogs, ears perked up, tail wagging slowly, awkwardly trotting around, completely unable to understand the game. When other dogs came up to him, he either conspicuously ignored them or cavorted around them in a strange and off-putting way like a court jester, which inevitably drove them away. After a while, he would take himself off to a corner on his own while the party raged around him.</p>    <p>It both broke my heart and fanned the flames of my hatred against the greyhound racing industry \u2013 but also, while I looked up articles on \u201chow to help my greyhound make friends\u201d, I realised this must be what my own parents went through when I was at primary school. I too was an awkward weirdo, simultaneously a loner who got given a special \u201cjob\u201d as a \u201clibrary assistant\u201d so I would be allowed to hide there at lunch, and the awkwardly intense kid who got in trouble for scaring his peers with a graphic tale about how a girl\u2019s leg fell off in the school toilet.

      "bodyText": "After his first day of daycare, my long, stinky son Basil came home with a report card that said he\u2019d been well-behaved but also needed to work on \u201cappropriate play\u201d. As a parent, I decided to take this constructive criticism normally. Initially I was just relieved that Basil hadn\u2019t murdered one of the other attenders of the daycare, which has put me in the weird position of having a lot of empathy for Dexter\u2019s dad. Basil is a dog, a rescue greyhound, trained to chase things for entertainment, and the fear that he might see a small, white, fluffy dog running and tear it to pieces is unfortunately real. Obviously I\u2019d done my due diligence, training and testing him with other dogs in controlled environments before getting to this stage, but the fear persists. Plus, as a newly single dog-parent, I unfortunately didn\u2019t have any other options \u2013 I had to go and work in an office so I could afford his expensive, single-protein diet food, sensitive-skin shampoo and anti-anxiety medication \u2013 which meant he had to go to daycare. But after the initial relief that my son was not a psychopath, I began to worry that my beautiful dog might be engaged in \u201cinappropriate\u201d play, whatever that was. I imagined it might be something sexually deviant. Luckily the daycare \u2013 appropriately titled Barks and Recreation \u2013 puts footage of the hounds playing on their Instagram stories throughout the day, meaning that while I was meant to be listening carefully in morning meetings and meeting my deadlines, I was digital helicopter parenting, compulsively watching to see exactly what my beloved boy was inappropriately doing. Instead of seeing him compulsively licking other dogs, or pissing on their heads, or gesturing at women to take out their earphones on public transport, I mostly watched Basil linger on the edges of all the frolicking dogs, ears perked up, tail wagging slowly, awkwardly trotting around, completely unable to understand the game. When other dogs came up to him, he either conspicuously ignored them or cavorted around them in a strange and off-putting way like a court jester, which inevitably drove them away. After a while, he would take himself off to a corner on his own while the party raged around him. It both broke my heart and fanned the flames of my hatred against the greyhound racing industry \u2013 but also, while I looked up articles on \u201chow to help my greyhound make friends\u201d, I realised this must be what my own parents went through when I was at primary school. I too was an awkward weirdo, simultaneously a loner who got given a special \u201cjob\u201d as a \u201clibrary assistant\u201d so I would be allowed to hide there at lunch, and the awkwardly intense kid who got in trouble for scaring his peers with a graphic tale about how a girl\u2019s leg fell off in the school toilet. Like Basil, I loved adults, and remember making friends with a nice boy named Matthew and spending all my time with his mum, a tiny child gossiping about people I didn\u2019t know and eating cucumber sandwiches, while Matthew kicked a ball around outside on his own. My parents did their best to help me, my dad spending a night teaching me how to \u201cwalk normally\u201d, or my mother giving a speech about standing up to bullies, which resulted in me hiding up a tree and throwing a cooked fish at a girl named Lauren.

      "body": "<p>When she\u2019s not gazing up into the night sky, the teen narrator of Inga Simpson\u2019s terrific new dystopian novel, The Thinning, spends a great deal of time looking anxiously at the bright orange watch her mother has strapped to her wrist. Fin Kelvin is her name, and like the reader, she doesn\u2019t know whether she\u2019s living at the end of the world or on the cusp of something new.</p> <p>Fin and her family have had to adapt to the demands of a rapidly changing world, one shaped by relentless resource extraction. They are reeling with grief as they try to survive on a planet on the brink of systems collapse. The Barrier Reef is dead, the last koala is gone, the Great Artesian Basin is contaminated, human fertility rates are plummeting and \u201cthe moon\u2019s cycles are all out of whack\u201d thanks to a space mining incident.</p> <p>The skies, meanwhile, are losing their darkness, thanks to the thousands of satellites that were launched to meet demand for communications technology \u2013 and to allow authoritarian governments and the sinister corporation MuX to surveil the citizenry.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>For Fin, who grew up at the Siding Spring Observatory (on Gamilaraay country in regional New South Wales), the child of a distinguished astronomer and an astrophotographer, the loss of darkness is particularly painful. She learns about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/21/aboriginal-astronomy-can-teach-us-about-the-link-between-sky-and-land\">cultural astronomy</a>, especially from Indigenous ranger Uncle Nate, and comes to understand light pollution as not just an impediment to scientific observation, but a new form of colonialism.</p> <p>Nothing in Fin\u2019s world is safe or stable any more. She gets pulled out of school when her principal lets it slip that compulsory fertility tests for women of childbearing age are on the way. She and her mum, Dianella, go off-grid after her father dies, living in the national park near the observatory. Dianella is a beguiling, heartbroken figure who simultaneously tries to shield her daughter from the brutal realities of a world on the tipping point and to prepare her for every catastrophic contingency by teaching her survival skills. \u201cWe had plans, as a family and as individuals, for every eventuality \u2013 except for what actually happened,\u201d Fin reflects ruefully.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/04/new-book-releases-australia-november\">Music memoirs, cooking classes and squatting at Kanye\u2019s: the best Australian books out in November</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fin\u2019s watch is synchronised to another worn by Dianella, who has given Fin a mission. She must travel from the Warrumbungle mountain range across the Pilliga region to the radio tower at Mount Kaputar in time for the solar eclipse. Once there, she must send a laser signal back to her mother. Fin doesn\u2019t understand her mission, and she\u2019s not particularly happy about it because she\u2019s got to look after another teenager: Terry, a teary fugitive with no bush skills.</p> <p>Fin is not so much an unreliable narrator as one frantic to make sense of the world she lives in before time runs out. We witness her efforts to metabolise the profound shocks of her era \u2013 extinctions, mass suicide and death, coerced reproduction, the fragmenting of families and communities. All the while the watch on her wrist counts down to the eclipse, like a ticking bomb.</p> <p>The snappy tension of the present tense is frequently broken by Fin\u2019s flashes back to her childhood and her acute observations of the natural world. It is a pleasure to see the Warrumbungles and the native forests of the Pilliga through her anxious eyes \u2013 on watching little birds at play, she notes: \u201cI worry that if I stop paying attention, they\u2019ll go\u201d \u2013 and to try to think with her about another timeframe beyond the urgent and terrifying present.</p> <p>For Fin, looking up helps. As her father told her: \u201cWhen we look at the stars, we\u2019re actually looking into the past. And the farther away we\u2019re looking, the further back in time we\u2019re seeing.\u201d By inviting her readers to think about cosmic time, Simpson reminds us that the ticking clock is not the only way to understand time.</p> <p>Even so, from the moment Fin and Terry set off on their journey, The Thinning moves with the compressed momentum of a thriller towards a spectacular climax at the eclipse. This is a moment where everyone on Earth, it seems, is looking up to the skies \u2013 and they are, in Fin\u2019s words, \u201cwitnesses to the end of the world as we knew it\u201d.</p> <p>The eclipse chapters are stunningly wrought, and bring together both the plot and Simpson\u2019s carefully tended metaphors about light, darkness and vision.

      "bodyText": "When she\u2019s not gazing up into the night sky, the teen narrator of Inga Simpson\u2019s terrific new dystopian novel, The Thinning, spends a great deal of time looking anxiously at the bright orange watch her mother has strapped to her wrist. Fin Kelvin is her name, and like the reader, she doesn\u2019t know whether she\u2019s living at the end of the world or on the cusp of something new. Fin and her family have had to adapt to the demands of a rapidly changing world, one shaped by relentless resource extraction. They are reeling with grief as they try to survive on a planet on the brink of systems collapse. The Barrier Reef is dead, the last koala is gone, the Great Artesian Basin is contaminated, human fertility rates are plummeting and \u201cthe moon\u2019s cycles are all out of whack\u201d thanks to a space mining incident. The skies, meanwhile, are losing their darkness, thanks to the thousands of satellites that were launched to meet demand for communications technology \u2013 and to allow authoritarian governments and the sinister corporation MuX to surveil the citizenry. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning For Fin, who grew up at the Siding Spring Observatory (on Gamilaraay country in regional New South Wales), the child of a distinguished astronomer and an astrophotographer, the loss of darkness is particularly painful. She learns about cultural astronomy, especially from Indigenous ranger Uncle Nate, and comes to understand light pollution as not just an impediment to scientific observation, but a new form of colonialism. Nothing in Fin\u2019s world is safe or stable any more. She gets pulled out of school when her principal lets it slip that compulsory fertility tests for women of childbearing age are on the way. She and her mum, Dianella, go off-grid after her father dies, living in the national park near the observatory. Dianella is a beguiling, heartbroken figure who simultaneously tries to shield her daughter from the brutal realities of a world on the tipping point and to prepare her for every catastrophic contingency by teaching her survival skills. \u201cWe had plans, as a family and as individuals, for every eventuality \u2013 except for what actually happened,\u201d Fin reflects ruefully. Fin\u2019s watch is synchronised to another worn by Dianella, who has given Fin a mission. She must travel from the Warrumbungle mountain range across the Pilliga region to the radio tower at Mount Kaputar in time for the solar eclipse. Once there, she must send a laser signal back to her mother. Fin doesn\u2019t understand her mission, and she\u2019s not particularly happy about it because she\u2019s got to look after another teenager: Terry, a teary fugitive with no bush skills. Fin is not so much an unreliable narrator as one frantic to make sense of the world she lives in before time runs out. We witness her efforts to metabolise the profound shocks of her era \u2013 extinctions, mass suicide and death, coerced reproduction, the fragmenting of families and communities. All the while the watch on her wrist counts down to the eclipse, like a ticking bomb. The snappy tension of the present tense is frequently broken by Fin\u2019s flashes back to her childhood and her acute observations of the natural world. It is a pleasure to see the Warrumbungles and the native forests of the Pilliga through her anxious eyes \u2013 on watching little birds at play, she notes: \u201cI worry that if I stop paying attention, they\u2019ll go\u201d \u2013 and to try to think with her about another timeframe beyond the urgent and terrifying present. For Fin, looking up helps. As her father told her: \u201cWhen we look at the stars, we\u2019re actually looking into the past. And the farther away we\u2019re looking, the further back in time we\u2019re seeing.\u201d By inviting her readers to think about cosmic time, Simpson reminds us that the ticking clock is not the only way to understand time. Even so, from the moment Fin and Terry set off on their journey, The Thinning moves with the compressed momentum of a thriller towards a spectacular climax at the eclipse. This is a moment where everyone on Earth, it seems, is looking up to the skies \u2013 and they are, in Fin\u2019s words, \u201cwitnesses to the end of the world as we knew it\u201d. The eclipse chapters are stunningly wrought, and bring together both the plot and Simpson\u2019s carefully tended metaphors about light, darkness and vision. All light is extinguished during the eclipse and \u201cthe boundaries and limits of the world are breached and broken\u201d. When the light returns, The Thinning illuminates a way to make a new world, through the radical and transformative possibilities of collective action. The Thinning is often melancholy, registering the profound losses of the climate crisis through the experience of a traumatised, exhausted teenager in the wild, searing darkness of the eclipse. But there is hope here too; Fin asks, \u201cWhat if we could see a way to make a new world, where all beings, no matter how fragile, could thrive?\u201d The Thinning by Inga Simpson is out now (Hachette Australia, $32.99)",

      "body": "<p>Let the humiliation Olympics begin. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> readies himself for his revenge tour, world leaders and business moguls are falling over themselves to show the incoming president how much they admire him. Even if it means making an embarrassment of themselves in the process.</p> <p>While it\u2019s only natural for the rich and powerful to try to ingratiate themselves with the incoming president of the United States, the extent to which <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-leaders-congratulated-donald-trump-what-they-said-before-david-lammy-emmanuel-macron/\">people are lining up</a> to kiss the ring is remarkable. This isn\u2019t just diplomacy as usual: it speaks to Trump\u2019s unapologetically transactional politics. He has made it very clear that loyalty will be richly rewarded and promised to ruthlessly pursue his enemies. As a result, we appear to have entered into a golden age of brown-nosing.</p> <p>Step one in transforming yourself into Trump\u2019s lapdog: delete any previous criticism of the former president that you may have ill-advisedly put out back when you still had a spine. See, for example, Australia\u2019s ambassador to the US, the former prime minister Kevin Rudd, who appears to have stayed up all night recently hitting the delete button on Twitter.</p> <p>\u201c[Trump is] the most destructive president in history,\u201d Rudd declared on Twitter, now X, in 2020, for example. \u201cHe drags America and democracy through the mud.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/11/a-new-era-dawns-americas-tech-bros-now-strut-their-stuff-in-the-corridors-of-power\">A new era dawns. America\u2019s tech bros now strut their stuff in the corridors of power | Carole Cadwalladr</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-leaders-congratulated-donald-trump-what-they-said-before-david-lammy-emmanuel-macron/\">That tweet</a>, along with others critical of the former president, has now been wiped clean. In a statement posted on his personal website last week, <a href=\"https://kevinrudd.com/media/statement-1\">Rudd explained</a> he had made those remarks back when he was a political commentator and deleted them to \u201celiminate the possibility of such comments being misconstrued as reflecting his positions as Ambassador\u201d.</p> <p>A more honest explanation might be that Rudd is terrified Trump will come up with a nasty nickname for him (Rudd the dud?) and impose enormous tariffs on Australia as payback.</p> <p>You can press the delete button as much as you like, but the internet has a very long memory. So, if you can\u2019t completely delete your way into Trump\u2019s good books the next step is to deny and defuse. <em>Technically</em>,<em> </em>you may have made some nasty comments about Trump in the past but you didn\u2019t mean them and, anyway, you\u2019ve seen the light now.</p> <p>This appears to be how the British foreign secretary, David Lammy, is dealing with the fact that, during his days as a backbench MP, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/08/david-lammy-dismisses-past-criticism-donald-trump-old-news\">described Trump as a \u201ctyrant\u201d</a> and \u201ca woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath\u201d. Lammy has also called Trump \u201cdeluded, dishonest, xenophobic, narcissistic\u201d and \u201cno friend of Britain\u201d.</p> <p>Seems pretty unambiguous. According to Lammy, we should forget all that because it is \u201cold news\u201d. In an interview with the BBC, Lammy added that he\u2019d made those comments when he was a silly backbencher and he <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2z1zm1pk3o\">knows better now</a>. \u201c[W]hat you say as a backbencher and what you do wearing the real duty of public office are two different things,\u201d Lammy explained. \u201cAnd I am foreign secretary. There are things I know now that I didn\u2019t know back then.\u201d</p> <p>What exactly does the older and wiser Lammy now know? Perhaps that he really likes having power and doesn\u2019t want anything as silly as having consistent morals to jeopardize it?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump has proved you can get away with anything; that power puts you above the law</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To be fair, it seems that a lot of people are now finding out a lot of important facts about Trump that they didn\u2019t know before because JD Vance has also made good use of Lammy\u2019s \u201colder and wiser\u201d defence. In the lead-up to the 2016 election, Vance called Trump an \u201cidiot\u201d who was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/04/opinion/campaign-stops/why-trumps-antiwar-message-resonates-with-white-america.html\">unfit for our nation\u2019s highest office</a>\u201d. He also characterized the man who would become his boss as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler\u201d. The incoming vice-president has of course, now realised <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/10/01/vance-walz-vp-debate-tonight/vances-past-trump-comments-00182072\">that he was</a> \u201cwrong about Donald Trump\u201d.</p> <p>And he is in powerful company: you would struggle to find a titan of industry who hasn\u2019t criticized Trump in the past and who isn\u2019t rapidly backtracking now. The <a href=\"https://popular.info/p/the-corporate-insurrection-of-2024\">Apple CEO, Tim Cook</a>; the Google CEO, Sundar Pichai; the Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella; and the former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos are among the high-profile business figures who have radically changed their tune when it comes to Trump.</p> <p>The Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has also undergone a Trumpian metamorphosis. He once accused Trump of inciting violence and <a href=\"https://popular.info/p/the-corporate-insurrection-of-2024\">undermining the law</a>; now he is lining up with the rest of the tech bros to gush about how excited he is to work with the Trump administration. Does Zuck always fawn over incoming presidents? No, he doesn\u2019t. As <a href=\"https://popular.info/p/the-corporate-insurrection-of-2024\">Popular Information has noted</a>: \u201cZuckerberg offered no congratulatory message at all to Biden after his 2020 victory.\u201d</p> <p>More broadly, Zuckerberg, who has been busy drastically revamping his wardrobe and public image, seems to have decided that Trump is a figure to admire and emulate. He called Trump a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-19/mark-zuckerberg-calls-donald-trump-badass-without-endorsing-for-president?embedded-checkout=true\">\u201cbadass\u201d in July</a>, after the former president survived an assassination attempt. Then, during a recent conference, Zuckerberg said the biggest mistake of his career <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/11/mark-zuckerberg-says-hes-done-apologizing/\">was apologizing too much</a>. Trump, after all, has proved you can get away with anything; that power puts you above the law.</p> <p>Weaseling your way into Trump\u2019s good books may be humiliating but it comes with a big payday: the president-elect is already busy doling out favours to friends. Elon Musk, for example, who spent over $100m getting Trump elected has been tapped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/trump-appoints-elon-musk-government-efficiency-department\">to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency</a>.

      "bodyText": "Let the humiliation Olympics begin. As Donald Trump readies himself for his revenge tour, world leaders and business moguls are falling over themselves to show the incoming president how much they admire him. Even if it means making an embarrassment of themselves in the process. While it\u2019s only natural for the rich and powerful to try to ingratiate themselves with the incoming president of the United States, the extent to which people are lining up to kiss the ring is remarkable. This isn\u2019t just diplomacy as usual: it speaks to Trump\u2019s unapologetically transactional politics. He has made it very clear that loyalty will be richly rewarded and promised to ruthlessly pursue his enemies. As a result, we appear to have entered into a golden age of brown-nosing. Step one in transforming yourself into Trump\u2019s lapdog: delete any previous criticism of the former president that you may have ill-advisedly put out back when you still had a spine. See, for example, Australia\u2019s ambassador to the US, the former prime minister Kevin Rudd, who appears to have stayed up all night recently hitting the delete button on Twitter. \u201c[Trump is] the most destructive president in history,\u201d Rudd declared on Twitter, now X, in 2020, for example. \u201cHe drags America and democracy through the mud.\u201d That tweet, along with others critical of the former president, has now been wiped clean. In a statement posted on his personal website last week, Rudd explained he had made those remarks back when he was a political commentator and deleted them to \u201celiminate the possibility of such comments being misconstrued as reflecting his positions as Ambassador\u201d. A more honest explanation might be that Rudd is terrified Trump will come up with a nasty nickname for him (Rudd the dud?) and impose enormous tariffs on Australia as payback. You can press the delete button as much as you like, but the internet has a very long memory. So, if you can\u2019t completely delete your way into Trump\u2019s good books the next step is to deny and defuse. Technically, you may have made some nasty comments about Trump in the past but you didn\u2019t mean them and, anyway, you\u2019ve seen the light now. This appears to be how the British foreign secretary, David Lammy, is dealing with the fact that, during his days as a backbench MP, he described Trump as a \u201ctyrant\u201d and \u201ca woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath\u201d. Lammy has also called Trump \u201cdeluded, dishonest, xenophobic, narcissistic\u201d and \u201cno friend of Britain\u201d. Seems pretty unambiguous. According to Lammy, we should forget all that because it is \u201cold news\u201d. In an interview with the BBC, Lammy added that he\u2019d made those comments when he was a silly backbencher and he knows better now. \u201c[W]hat you say as a backbencher and what you do wearing the real duty of public office are two different things,\u201d Lammy explained. \u201cAnd I am foreign secretary. There are things I know now that I didn\u2019t know back then.\u201d What exactly does the older and wiser Lammy now know? Perhaps that he really likes having power and doesn\u2019t want anything as silly as having consistent morals to jeopardize it? To be fair, it seems that a lot of people are now finding out a lot of important facts about Trump that they didn\u2019t know before because JD Vance has also made good use of Lammy\u2019s \u201colder and wiser\u201d defence. In the lead-up to the 2016 election, Vance called Trump an \u201cidiot\u201d who was \u201cunfit for our nation\u2019s highest office\u201d. He also characterized the man who would become his boss as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler\u201d. The incoming vice-president has of course, now realised that he was \u201cwrong about Donald Trump\u201d. And he is in powerful company: you would struggle to find a titan of industry who hasn\u2019t criticized Trump in the past and who isn\u2019t rapidly backtracking now. The Apple CEO, Tim Cook; the Google CEO, Sundar Pichai; the Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella; and the former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos are among the high-profile business figures who have radically changed their tune when it comes to Trump. The Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has also undergone a Trumpian metamorphosis. He once accused Trump of inciting violence and undermining the law; now he is lining up with the rest of the tech bros to gush about how excited he is to work with the Trump administration. Does Zuck always fawn over incoming presidents? No, he doesn\u2019t. As Popular Information has noted: \u201cZuckerberg offered no congratulatory message at all to Biden after his 2020 victory.\u201d More broadly, Zuckerberg, who has been busy drastically revamping his wardrobe and public image, seems to have decided that Trump is a figure to admire and emulate. He called Trump a \u201cbadass\u201d in July, after the former president survived an assassination attempt. Then, during a recent conference, Zuckerberg said the biggest mistake of his career was apologizing too much. Trump, after all, has proved you can get away with anything; that power puts you above the law. Weaseling your way into Trump\u2019s good books may be humiliating but it comes with a big payday: the president-elect is already busy doling out favours to friends. Elon Musk, for example, who spent over $100m getting Trump elected has been tapped to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency. This allows Musk, whose companies have received more than $15.4bn in government contracts, to be a lot more efficient about rerouting public funds into his private purse. Meanwhile Trump is assembling his cabinet, and it is has become apparent that the most important qualification for office is a history of saying nice things about the president-elect. Pete Hegseth, for example, a Fox News personality and military veteran with no meaningful foreign policy experience has been picked to be secretary of defense. The New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, who stood by Trump when he faced impeachment and became one of his staunchest cheerleaders, is being rewarded for her sycophancy with a gig as ambassador to the United Nations. Like Hegseth, she also has no meaningful foreign policy experience but she will support Israel and Trump no matter what they do, which is all that matters. The South Dakota governor, Kristi Noem, will reportedly lead the Department of Homeland Security. She doesn\u2019t have a huge amount of experience in this area, nor does she represent a border state, but she does have a lot of experience in trying to curry favour with Trump. Noem, who is famous for once shooting her family dog, has echoed Trump\u2019s hardline immigration rhetoric and plied the president with gifts.

Rubio is reportedly being considered for secretary of state. So there you go: we are officially a quid pro quo economy now. It\u2019s no wonder that Trump\u2019s former critics are all suddenly reinventing themselves and tech bros are lining up to say how \u201cexcited\u2019 they are to work with the Trump administration.

When it comes to baking, practise does eventually make perfect. There are some common baking mishaps that, like life, just happen. Here are some tips to help you avoid some more common catastrophes and ensure you become a better baker. Why does my cake always sink (and never rise)? There are a couple of different things that can cause a dippy cake. The raising agent has expired. If the cake has a raising agent, such as baking powder, this needs to be incorporated into the cake batter swiftly and then the cake placed into the oven immediately. Baking powder is activated the minute it comes into contact with liquid and so the longer it sits in the cake tin before baking, the higher the chances of its \u201craising powers\u201d expiring.

Pull them out of the fridge the night before to allow them to come up to room temperature. You tried to add whole eggs to the butter. Give the eggs a little whisk with a fork to break them up and this will assist their union with the butter. Why is my cake so dense and dry? There are a few things that could have happened here. I think a lot of cake recipes have too much flour in them. Cut the flour quantity with a proportion of nut meal to impart moisture and lower the gluten (ultimately, gluten gives the cake its dryness). The cake batter has curdled as you\u2019re making it (see above). A curdled cake will need to cook for longer because the structure of the batter is broken. This usually results in a dry cake. The cake doesn\u2019t have enough fat. Depending on the cake you\u2019re making, increase the fat \u2013 oil, milk or butter \u2013 already in the recipe. Start with a modest increase \u2013 about 10%. This will lighten the cake and impart more moisture that then translates to steam. Why are my sponges not fluffy and light? A light and fluffy sponge is created by aerating eggs and then gently folding the dry ingredients through to preserve the air you have created. This can be difficult because there are so many folds to make before the sponge is completely combined, that the batter gradually deflates. The secret is to make a strong base first. Some sponges require you to separate the eggs and whip the yolks and whites separately with sugar, then combine them. In this case the meringue (the egg white component) is the key element to making a strong base \u2013 add the sugar slowly, a little at a time, for best results. My favourite way to make a fluffy sponge is by using the genoise method. Heat the cracked whole eggs and sugar over hot (not boiling) water slightly before whisking them until they cool. This creates a strong stable base to allow for all the folding of flour so that by the time the sponge goes in the oven the air is still preserved. Using cake flour or Japanese chiffon flour, which are both lower in protein than all-purpose flour, will also improve your sponge immeasurably. How do I stop my cakes from sticking in the pan? The best way to line a cake tin is with baking paper, cut neatly to the same size of the base, with a long strip as a \u201ccollar\u201d around the sides. At Flour and Stone we use a light spray of oil to adhere the paper collars and bases to the tins (of which there are hundreds!) \u2013 this stops the liner moving around and keeps it snug to the curves of the tin. If you have a bundt tin that can\u2019t be lined with paper, grease it with butter and sprinkle lightly with flour. You could also try caster sugar instead of flour, which will give a nicer shine on the edges of the cake. The most important thing is that the greasing butter should be softened \u2013 not melted. Melting the butter will cause the fat to separate, and when you brush it on the tin, the fat distribution will be uneven, and you might find the cake will only stick in patches. If you are greasing a really ornate bundt tin, brush with softened butter, then sprinkle with either flour or sugar, followed by a very light spray of oil.

In early November, a fire in an apartment in New Farm in inner-city Brisbane is also believed by authorities to have been sparked by an e-scooter battery. In March, batteries resulted in four separate fires in a single day in New South Wales. Fire and Rescue NSW has referred to lithium-ion batteries as the \u201cfastest-growing fire risk\u201d in the state. The agency responded to 272 battery-related fires last year \u2013 more than five each week. Fire services in both Victoria and Queensland have said they respond to lithium-ion battery fires almost every day. Why do lithium batteries keep exploding \u2013 and what can be done to prevent fires? What are lithium-ion batteries found in? There are many different types of lithium-ion batteries, says Prof Amanda Ellis, head of the school of chemical and biomedical engineering at the University of Melbourne. \u201cOverall, they\u2019re actually very safe if they\u2019re operated correctly.\u201d Lithium-ion batteries are ubiquitous \u2013 powering everything from mobile phones and computers to e-scooters, e-bikes and electric cars. They are widely used because they are able to charge quickly, deliver energy quickly and have long battery life. The largest lithium-ion battery in Australia, known as the Victorian Big Battery, is a 300 megawatt storage battery in Geelong, which stores enough energy to power more than 1m homes for half an hour. Why do lithium-ion batteries catch on fire? Lithium-ion batteries, as the name suggests, contains lithium ions suspended in an electrolyte solution. The ions flow through the electrolyte, travelling back and forth between two electrodes as the battery charges and discharges. If a lithium-ion battery is charged too fast, it can result in thermal runaway \u2013 an uncontrollable increase in temperature. \u201cThe electrolyte heats up, because there\u2019s too much energy in the battery,\u201d Ellis says. \u201cIt\u2019s in a pressurised system, and so then all of a sudden \u2013 bang \u2026 it\u2019ll crack.\u201d The liquid electrolyte is highly flammable and will burst into flames when exposed to air. Overheating and physical damage are the main causes of battery failure. Lithium-ion battery fires can reach high temperatures within seconds and release highly toxic gases. Because of their chemical components, burning batteries can develop self-sustaining flames that are difficult to extinguish. Does battery quality matter? Battery fires can happen because of physical damage, manufacturing faults and overcharging, according to Hussein Dia, a professor of future urban mobility at the Swinburne University of Technology. Another contributing factor, Ellis says, is that \u201cpeople are thinking that all batteries are real batteries for the appliance that they have and that the cheapest one will do \u2013 that\u2019s where the danger is\u201d. In EVs, batteries make up roughly 40% of the cost of the vehicle, Dia says. \u201cThere are a lot of sophisticated designs and thermal management systems that go into them \u2013 but it is not the same case in e-bikes and e-scooters.\u201d Statistics show that while EV fires do occur, they are rare. \u201cThey have a lower probability [of catching fire] compared to petrol or diesel cars,\u201d Dia says. \u201cHowever, for e-scooters and e-bikes the incidence is higher, and in most cases the data shows that people are either overcharging or using unapproved charging devices.\u201d How can you prevent a battery fire? There are practical steps people can take to lower the chances of a lithium-ion battery fire. Firstly, follow the manufacturer\u2019s advice and use the approved charger. Avoid overcharging a device\u2019s battery. \u201cEven with EVs, car manufacturers don\u2019t recommend that the batteries are fully charged \u2013 a charge up to 80% should be sufficient,\u201d Dia says. Dia added that charging shouldn\u2019t be unsupervised \u2013 when people are sleeping or aren\u2019t home, for example. Fire authorities recommend that batteries be charged on hard surfaces \u2013 such as tile or concrete floors \u2013 rather than soft surfaces like beds or carpet. \u201cBatteries are safe but they\u2019ve got to be operated in the conditions that they were designed for,\u201d Ellis says. Batteries cannot be thrown away in regular bins, because they can result in fires at waste and recycling sites, and should be recycled through dedicated battery disposal schemes.",

This should be done now \u2013 it doesn\u2019t need to wait for the outcome of a review.\u201d</p> <p>At the budget a fortnight ago, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the government would look into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/30/carers-earnings-limit-to-rise-by-45-a-week-in-wake-of-allowance-scandal\">removing the cliff edge</a>, but officials have warned this could be a lengthy process. She also extended the carer\u2019s allowance earnings limit to \u00a3196 from next April, which may help reduce overpayment numbers.</p> <p>Guardian analysis of courts data for England shows that since April at least seven unpaid carers have been prosecuted after being referred by DWP counter-fraud officials for earnings-related breaches of carer\u2019s allowance.</p> <p>The criminalisation of unpaid carers for unwittingly overstepping earnings limits \u2013 taking them to court even in most cases after they have agreed to repay the overpayment \u2013 is one of the most controversial aspects of the carer\u2019s allowance scandal.</p> <p>In one notorious case, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/07/dwp-carer-allowance-benefit-payment-case\">Vivienne Groom</a>, an unpaid carer and part-time shop worker, was not only prosecuted for fraud but also had the \u00a316,000 inheritance she got from the mother she cared for clawed back by the DWP using proceeds of crime laws normally reserved to seize the assets of drug barons.</p> <p>The DWP has also come under fire for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/aug/19/unpaid-carer-dwp-prosecution-threat-like-blackmail\">threatening some carers with prosecution</a> unless they agree to pay a 50% premium on the repayment. One unpaid carer, Clemency Jacques, described her experience of this as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/aug/19/unpaid-carer-dwp-prosecution-threat-like-blackmail\">\u201clike blackmail\u201d</a>. Officials later waived her penalty after her case <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/sep/12/dwp-waives-1300-penalty-for-unpaid-carer-threatened-with-prosecution\">appeared in the Guardian</a>.</p> <p>Although legally the onus is on carer\u2019s allowance claimants to report any earnings limit breaches to the DWP, there is frustration that even when the department is aware of a breach it does not automatically alert claimants, meaning avoidable overpayments can accumulate for long periods, raising the risk of prosecution.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe recognise the challenges carers are facing, which is why we are increasing the carer\u2019s allowance earnings threshold, giving unpaid carers the opportunity to earn more and still receive the government support they deserve. </p> <p>\u201cWe have also launched a review into carer\u2019s allowance overpayments to prevent people who devote such time and care to others from facing difficulties in the future.\u201d</p>",

Since April, when the carer\u2019s allowance scandal was first revealed by the Guardian, officials have begun to recoup overpayments debts from more than 15,000 carers, with 50 of them repaying sums of at least \u00a310,000. Campaigners and politicians have called on ministers \u2013 who have promised to learn from \u201cproblems and mistakes\u201d with allowance \u2013 to intervene urgently to minimise the ongoing devastating impact on carers while an independent review of the benefit takes place. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey, himself a carer for his teenage son, said: \u201cI\u2019m glad we have secured a review, but it can\u2019t be right for the DWP to carry on like business as usual while that review takes place.

As many as one in five carer\u2019s allowance claimants have been hit by \u201ccliff-edge\u201d punishments for breaching earnings limits, where going just \u00a31 over the weekly limit means having to repay the entire benefit. A carer who earned \u00a31 more than the \u00a3151 threshold for 52 weeks would pay back not \u00a352 but \u00a34,258.80. The latest figures suggest as many as 259 carers have come into scope for legal proceedings since April after unwittingly building up large overpayments. A key criterion for referring claimants to the Crown Prosecution Service for fraud is that the overpayment sum is more than \u00a35,000. In two cases since April, carers have been forced to repay more than \u00a320,000, which suggests the DWP failed to spot the allowance earnings breaches for nearly five years, even though in theory it would have been alerted electronically to the infringements early on by HMRC. Separate figures, obtained under freedom of information laws, show thousands more carers are unknowingly building up large debts because there is an administrative backlog of 29,000 carer\u2019s allowance cases awaiting investigation for possible breaches of earning limits. The Carers Trust estimates a further 10,000 carers could be caught by the system over the next few months and it has urged ministers to write off any carer\u2019s allowance overpayment charges while the review is under way. \u201cThe review is very welcome but these alarming figures show that the root cause of the problem hasn\u2019t gone away,\u201d said the charity\u2019s director of policy, Dominic Carter. \u201cThe flaws with these overpayment demands are well known by now so it is staggering that many carers are still suffering the consequences.\u201d Helen Walker, the chief executive of Carers UK, said: \u201cThe alerts of overpayments don\u2019t seem to be being investigated quickly enough and government needs to invest more resource in ensuring that alerts about overpayments are swiftly looked at. This should be done now \u2013 it doesn\u2019t need to wait for the outcome of a review.\u201d At the budget a fortnight ago, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the government would look into removing the cliff edge, but officials have warned this could be a lengthy process. She also extended the carer\u2019s allowance earnings limit to \u00a3196 from next April, which may help reduce overpayment numbers. Guardian analysis of courts data for England shows that since April at least seven unpaid carers have been prosecuted after being referred by DWP counter-fraud officials for earnings-related breaches of carer\u2019s allowance. The criminalisation of unpaid carers for unwittingly overstepping earnings limits \u2013 taking them to court even in most cases after they have agreed to repay the overpayment \u2013 is one of the most controversial aspects of the carer\u2019s allowance scandal. In one notorious case, Vivienne Groom, an unpaid carer and part-time shop worker, was not only prosecuted for fraud but also had the \u00a316,000 inheritance she got from the mother she cared for clawed back by the DWP using proceeds of crime laws normally reserved to seize the assets of drug barons. The DWP has also come under fire for threatening some carers with prosecution unless they agree to pay a 50% premium on the repayment. One unpaid carer, Clemency Jacques, described her experience of this as \u201clike blackmail\u201d. Officials later waived her penalty after her case appeared in the Guardian. Although legally the onus is on carer\u2019s allowance claimants to report any earnings limit breaches to the DWP, there is frustration that even when the department is aware of a breach it does not automatically alert claimants, meaning avoidable overpayments can accumulate for long periods, raising the risk of prosecution. A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe recognise the challenges carers are facing, which is why we are increasing the carer\u2019s allowance earnings threshold, giving unpaid carers the opportunity to earn more and still receive the government support they deserve. \u201cWe have also launched a review into carer\u2019s allowance overpayments to prevent people who devote such time and care to others from facing difficulties in the future.\u201d",

The new lawsuit claims that Unilever breached the agreement to \u201crespect and acknowledge the Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s independent board\u2019s primary responsibility over Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s social mission\u201d, adding: \u201cBen &amp; Jerry\u2019s has on four occasions attempted to publicly speak out in support of peace and human rights.\u201d Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s said in the lawsuit that it has tried to call for a ceasefire, support the safe passage of Palestinian refugees to Britain, back students protesting at US colleges against civilian deaths in Gaza and advocate a halt to US military aid to Israel. \u201cUnilever has silenced each of these efforts,\u201d Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s said. A Unilever spokesperson said: \u201cOur heart goes out to all victims of the tragic events in the Middle East. We reject the claims made by B&amp;J\u2019s social mission board, and we will defend our case very strongly. We would not comment further on this legal matter.\u201d Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield founded the ice-cream company in Vermont in the US in 1978 with a mission to \u201cadvance human rights and dignity\u201d. Unilever acquired the business in 2000 but it is run autonomously by an independent board of directors, allowing it to campaign on social issues. In March, Unilever said it intended to sell off its ice-cream division, which also includes Wall\u2019s and Magnum, by the end of next year. In April, bosses at Unilever said Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s campaigning was a \u201cstrength not a weakness\u201d.",

Just a month after the much-publicised opening, only 24 asylum seekers have been sent to Albania, and none remain there now; five spent less than 12 hours in a detention centre, while the rest stayed for just over 48 hours.

In doing so the judges were upholding a 4 October ruling by the European Union\u2019s court of justice (ECJ) that a country outside the bloc could not be declared safe unless its entire territory was deemed safe. Italy\u2019s embarrassment over the scheme, attacked by opposition parties as a \u201ccomplete failure\u201d that will cost about \u20ac1bn (\u00a3830m) over five years, has sparked a row between the authorities and the judges, who have been accused by far-right parties of obstructing the project.

In the face of the deal\u2019s gradual demise, the Italian government has lashed out in time-honoured fashion against the judiciary, describing those who ruled against the deal as \u201cpoliticised magistrates\u201d who \u201cwould like to abolish Italy\u2019s borders\u201d. Even Elon Musk has weighed in, throwing his support behind his friend Meloni and denouncing the magistrates\u2019 decision by declaring: \u201cThese judges must go.\u201d In a highly unusual move, Italy\u2019s president, Sergio Mattarella, gave Musk an acid response: \u201cItaly knows how to take care of itself.\u201d Last week, police strengthened protections for Silvia Albano, one of the six judges of the immigration section of the Rome court who on 18 October did not validate the detention of asylum seekers in Albania. She has received death threats since the ruling. Stefano Musolino, deputy prosecutor of Reggio Calabria and a member of the national magistrates association, said: \u201cWhat is not understood is that if a judge were to authorise the repatriation or detention of migrants in Albania, contrary to the international laws that bind Italy, their verdicts would be illicit.\u201d At a time when the government is struggling to balance the budget \u2013 cutting funds for education, health and social security \u2013 opposition parties have described the deal as a \u201cfinancial disaster\u201d. Elly Schlein, the leader of Italy\u2019s Democratic party, said: \u201cMeloni raises taxes and squanders nearly a billion euros of taxpayers\u2019 money on migrant centres in Albania. We could have used those to strengthen the national health service where more than 4.5 million people are unable to receive treatment every year. Now it\u2019s time for Meloni to dismantle the centres. Then, it\u2019s time for her to apologise to all Italians.\u201d",

Afterwards he moved into a lengthy career working with people with learning difficulties in Edgware, north London, first at the Springwood Crescent Centre, as a physical education and sports instructor, and then at Broadfields Resource Centre, in charge of its sports programmes. That work, he maintained, was every bit as enjoyable and rewarding as his exploits on the football field. Dempsey is survived by his second wife, Trish, and two children, Louise and Paul, from his first marriage to Margaret, which ended in divorce. \u2022 John Thomas Dempsey, footballer, born 15 March 1946; died 6 November 2024",

      "body": "<p>When Donald Trump tapped a Fox News host this week to run the mighty US defense department, even Pete Hegseth\u2019s colleagues at the rightwing media outlet were taken aback.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the heck \u2013 can you believe it?\u201d wondered Jesse Watters on his primetime show on Tuesday.</p> <p>\u201cTaken right from this very couch!\u201d exclaimed Hegseth\u2019s fellow Fox &amp; Friends talker Brian Kilmeade on Wednesday.</p> <p>This bemused enthusiasm was for public, on-air consumption.</p> <p>But in private, some had a dimmer view, according to Brian Stelter, author of two books about the Murdoch-controlled network.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me Pete is going to oversee 2 million employees?\u201d <a href=\"https://x.com/brianstelter/status/1856702467003560408\">clucked</a> one Fox host to Stelter; as the CNN media analyst noted, it\u2019s actually almost three.</p> <p>In Hoax: Donald Trump, Fox News, and the Dangerous Distortion of Truth, Stelter reported that Hegseth \u2013 a decorated veteran who served with the Minnesota national guard in Iraq and Afghanistan \u2013 consistently played to a singularly important viewer, checking his phone during commercial breaks in case Trump had commented on the show.</p> <p>And while Hegseth <em>has </em>directed a non-profit veterans\u2019 advocacy group, nothing suggests he\u2019s ready to run the world\u2019s largest military. More alarmingly, he has encouraged Trump to pardon military personnel accused of war crimes, argued against women serving in the armed forces, and expressed the merit in a \u201cpreemptive strike\u201d against North Korea.</p> <p>Although extreme, this development isn\u2019t exactly breaking new ground.</p> <p>The Fox-to-Trump revolving door has been spinning for years. During his first term, Trump <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/donald-trump/comprehensive-review-revolving-door-between-fox-and-second-trump-administration\">hired</a> at least 20 officials who had previously worked at or contributed to Fox, making some of them cabinet secretaries and high-ranking White House aides.</p> <p>Remember, for instance, Richard Grenell, who joined Fox in 2009 and was still working there when he was nominated to be Trump\u2019s ambassador to Germany in 2017? A few years later, Grenell was named Trump\u2019s acting director of national intelligence. Or Ben Carson, a Fox contributor for years before becoming Trump\u2019s secretary of housing and urban development?</p> <p>One particularly memorable case was Bill Shine, a high-ranking Fox executive, who left the network after allegedly helping to cover up the company\u2019s culture of sexual harassment that brought down his buddy, co-founder Roger Ailes.</p> <p>No problem, though. Shine got a soft landing at the Trump White House as deputy chief of staff for communications, and later moved to Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to jump from Fox to a job at a serious news organization. But, if you want to work at the Trump White House, there are few better r\u00e9sum\u00e9-builders.</p> <p>\u201cThe president\u2019s worldview is shaped by the hours of Fox programming he watches each day, leading him to treat Fox employment as an important credential in hiring,\u201d Matt Gertz, senior fellow at Media Matters for America, <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/comprehensive-review-revolving-door-between-fox-and-trump-administration\">wrote</a> in 2019.</p> <p>In the past few days, he also tapped the Fox News contributor Tom Homan as his \u201cborder czar\u201d. Homan joined Fox shortly after his retirement as acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement director in 2018, during Trump\u2019s first term.</p> <p>The door spins and spins again.</p> <p>Going for the trifecta, Trump named Mike Huckabee, former governor of Arkansas and former host of a weekly Fox show, as his preferred ambassador to Israel.</p> <p>Can a glorified perch for Sean Hannity \u2013 long the Trump whisperer \u2013 be far behind? And what about Tucker Carlson, despite being fired by the network last year?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/13/donald-trump-administration-foreign-policy\">Is Donald Trump a foreign policy dove? If only | Mehdi Hasan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Trump/Fox fit is a natural; one thing they share is a truth problem. Trump, of course, lies with fluid impunity.</p> <p>And Fox \u2013 though it insists on calling itself a news organization \u2013 has helped to spread lies and disinformation, including about the supposedly \u201crigged\u201d 2020 election that Trump still insists he won. No matter that Fox <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/18/fox-dominion-settle-us-defamation-lawsuit\">had to pay Dominion Voting Systems nearly $800m</a> in a court settlement after they sued for defamation.</p> <p>\u201cInstead of promoting lies and conspiracy theories from outlets like Fox News and the online fever swamps,\u201d wrote Oliver Darcy in his Status newsletter, \u201cthese media personalities will now be doing so with the US government\u2019s resources and backing.\u201d</p> <p>There could be no Trump as president without Fox. And Fox\u2019s market capitalization is now approaching $20bn.</p> <p>Whatever they\u2019re doing is working for mutual benefit, if not for US democracy.</p> <p>With this week\u2019s developments, any line of separation \u2013 if it ever existed \u2013 is being erased.

      "bodyText": "When Donald Trump tapped a Fox News host this week to run the mighty US defense department, even Pete Hegseth\u2019s colleagues at the rightwing media outlet were taken aback. \u201cWhat the heck \u2013 can you believe it?\u201d wondered Jesse Watters on his primetime show on Tuesday. \u201cTaken right from this very couch!\u201d exclaimed Hegseth\u2019s fellow Fox &amp; Friends talker Brian Kilmeade on Wednesday. This bemused enthusiasm was for public, on-air consumption. But in private, some had a dimmer view, according to Brian Stelter, author of two books about the Murdoch-controlled network. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me Pete is going to oversee 2 million employees?\u201d clucked one Fox host to Stelter; as the CNN media analyst noted, it\u2019s actually almost three. In Hoax: Donald Trump, Fox News, and the Dangerous Distortion of Truth, Stelter reported that Hegseth \u2013 a decorated veteran who served with the Minnesota national guard in Iraq and Afghanistan \u2013 consistently played to a singularly important viewer, checking his phone during commercial breaks in case Trump had commented on the show. And while Hegseth has directed a non-profit veterans\u2019 advocacy group, nothing suggests he\u2019s ready to run the world\u2019s largest military. More alarmingly, he has encouraged Trump to pardon military personnel accused of war crimes, argued against women serving in the armed forces, and expressed the merit in a \u201cpreemptive strike\u201d against North Korea. Although extreme, this development isn\u2019t exactly breaking new ground. The Fox-to-Trump revolving door has been spinning for years. During his first term, Trump hired at least 20 officials who had previously worked at or contributed to Fox, making some of them cabinet secretaries and high-ranking White House aides. Remember, for instance, Richard Grenell, who joined Fox in 2009 and was still working there when he was nominated to be Trump\u2019s ambassador to Germany in 2017? A few years later, Grenell was named Trump\u2019s acting director of national intelligence. Or Ben Carson, a Fox contributor for years before becoming Trump\u2019s secretary of housing and urban development? One particularly memorable case was Bill Shine, a high-ranking Fox executive, who left the network after allegedly helping to cover up the company\u2019s culture of sexual harassment that brought down his buddy, co-founder Roger Ailes. No problem, though. Shine got a soft landing at the Trump White House as deputy chief of staff for communications, and later moved to Trump\u2019s re-election campaign. It\u2019s hard to jump from Fox to a job at a serious news organization. But, if you want to work at the Trump White House, there are few better r\u00e9sum\u00e9-builders. \u201cThe president\u2019s worldview is shaped by the hours of Fox programming he watches each day, leading him to treat Fox employment as an important credential in hiring,\u201d Matt Gertz, senior fellow at Media Matters for America, wrote in 2019. In the past few days, he also tapped the Fox News contributor Tom Homan as his \u201cborder czar\u201d. Homan joined Fox shortly after his retirement as acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement director in 2018, during Trump\u2019s first term. The door spins and spins again. Going for the trifecta, Trump named Mike Huckabee, former governor of Arkansas and former host of a weekly Fox show, as his preferred ambassador to Israel. Can a glorified perch for Sean Hannity \u2013 long the Trump whisperer \u2013 be far behind? And what about Tucker Carlson, despite being fired by the network last year? The Trump/Fox fit is a natural; one thing they share is a truth problem. Trump, of course, lies with fluid impunity. And Fox \u2013 though it insists on calling itself a news organization \u2013 has helped to spread lies and disinformation, including about the supposedly \u201crigged\u201d 2020 election that Trump still insists he won. No matter that Fox had to pay Dominion Voting Systems nearly $800m in a court settlement after they sued for defamation. \u201cInstead of promoting lies and conspiracy theories from outlets like Fox News and the online fever swamps,\u201d wrote Oliver Darcy in his Status newsletter, \u201cthese media personalities will now be doing so with the US government\u2019s resources and backing.\u201d There could be no Trump as president without Fox. And Fox\u2019s market capitalization is now approaching $20bn. Whatever they\u2019re doing is working for mutual benefit, if not for US democracy. With this week\u2019s developments, any line of separation \u2013 if it ever existed \u2013 is being erased. The two are nearly a single organism.

      "bodyText": "The heir to the Colman\u2019s mustard dynasty and his wife, a member of the clergy, have been asked by the Church of England to step back from their roles in a Hampshire church after being named in a damning report on a sadistic abuser. Sir Jamie Colman has been asked to cease his volunteering activities at St Leonard\u2019s church, Oakley, and the Rev Sue Colman has been asked to step back from all ministerial duties by the diocese of Winchester. According to a report, the couple financially supported John Smyth, a powerful and charismatic barrister who sadistically beat boys and young men, despite knowing of the allegations about his abuse. Colman became chair of the Zambesi Trust UK, a charity that channelled funds to Smyth after he moved to southern Africa, and the couple sought to persuade others to support him. They visited Christian camps in Zimbabwe run by Smyth and stayed with the abuser and his wife. A report by Keith Makin on Smyth\u2019s abuse and its cover-up said Colman was \u201cvery closely associated with John Smyth\u201d and that his \u201cpersonal support for John Smyth and his family was very important in enabling John Smyth to develop his mission in Zimbabwe\u201d. Since inheriting the baronetcy from his father last year, Colman has headed a family trust that oversees \u00a39m of investments. A statement from the diocese of Winchester said it had asked Sue Colman \u201cto step back from all ministerial duties while we reflect on the review\u2019s findings and work with the national safeguarding team to take steps to manage any associated risk\u201d. Jamie Colman had \u201cno official ministerial position in our diocese but has also been asked to step back from volunteering\u201d, the statement said. It said Philip Mounstephen, the bishop of Winchester, had \u201cmade it clear that all failures in safeguarding should be treated with the utmost seriousness, whether locally or nationally, and that the response to those failures should be proportionate and appropriate\u201d. Meanwhile, a former member of the Crown Nominations Commission (CNC) has said it is \u201cunconscionable\u201d that a retired clergyman who the report said probably knew of Smyth\u2019s abuse but failed to take action could be part of the selection process for the next archbishop of Canterbury. The Rev Andrew Cornes is among a panel of 11 members of the C of E\u2019s ruling body, the General Synod, from whom six will be chosen to sit on the committee that appoints Justin Welby\u2019s successor. Anthony Archer, who sat on the CNC for five years, said: \u201cIt is unconscionable that Andrew Cornes remained a member of the CNC, but this is a matter for the bishop of Chichester and the archbishops\u2019 secretary for appointments, Stephen Knott. He should of course just resign.\u201d A spokesperson for the diocese of Chichester said they could not comment while the findings of the Makin report were being reviewed by the C of E\u2019s national safeguarding team to see if further action needed to be taken.

But few understand why it frightens so many | Frances Ryan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some NHS medical staff oppose assisted dying because of religious beliefs. According to a 2014 report, nearly seven of 10 NHS workers had a religious affiliation. An estimated 10% of current NHS staff are Muslim.</p> <p>Prominent faith leaders including the archbishop of Canterbury (who announced this week he was standing down), the most senior Catholic leader in England and Wales, several imams, and the chief rabbi, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/18/george-carey-archbishop-c-of-e-bishops-lords-back-assisted-dying-bill\">stated their opposition to assisted dying</a> in recent weeks.</p> <p>Christian Concern, an evangelical organisation that supports legal cases involving Christian workers including NHS staff, said it was planning to \u201cresist the bill at every stage\u201d but would \u201cdo all we can to ensure conscientious objection\u201d should it become law.</p> <p>Mark Pickering, a doctor and the chief executive of the Christian Medical Fellowship, whose membership includes about 4,500 doctors, nurses and midwives, said a \u201cconscience clause\u201d may provide only limited protection.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t foresee a situation in which anyone is forced to actually prescribe the medication for somebody to kill themselves. But, for instance in Canada, there have been significant problems around conscience.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Leadbeater said: \u201cChristian, Muslims and others are protected and cannot be subject to any detriment from their employer for choosing not to participate.\u201d</p> <p>Under Canadian law, healthcare professionals who object to assisted dying are required to make an \u201ceffective referral\u201d to a medic who is willing to provide the service.</p> <p>\u201cMany of our members would see that as morally problematic. Because if you say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to shoot granny, but I\u2019ll send her to someone who will\u2019, there isn\u2019t much moral difference,\u201d said Pickering.</p> <p>David Randall, a renal consultant, said his Christian faith had influenced his opposition to assisted dying, but his primary concerns were about the risks to vulnerable people and the relationship of trust between doctor and patient.</p> <p>The issue of assisted dying was \u201cso far away from what I experience in the multi-ethnic, deprived areas of London where I work. One of the biggest issues is the lack of trust in medicine\u201d.</p> <p>Randall said he saw people presenting late with advanced kidney disease because of a reluctance to consult their GP.

      "bodyText": "A significant proportion of NHS medical staff in England and Wales are likely to exercise a \u201cconscience clause\u201d if assisted dying is legalised by parliament. Labour MP Kim Leadbeater\u2019s private member\u2019s bill stipulates that no doctor would be under any obligation to participate in assisted dying. The British Medical Association (BMA), which holds a neutral position on assisted dying, has said doctors should be required to proactively \u201copt in\u201d to an assisted dying process, and have a right to decline to carry out any activities directly related to assisted dying. It wants doctors to be given a \u201cgenuine choice about whether, and if so to what extent, they are willing to participate\u201d. Surveys by professional bodies have found a mixed response. In 2023, the Royal College of Surgeons found 53% of respondents to a survey were in favour of assisted dying and 25% opposed. In 2019, a Royal College of Physicians poll found 31% in favour and 43% opposed; and a Royal College of GPs survey the same year found 40% in favour and 47% opposed. A BMA survey in 2020 found 50% backed assisted dying, with 39% opposed. Some NHS medical staff oppose assisted dying because of religious beliefs. According to a 2014 report, nearly seven of 10 NHS workers had a religious affiliation. An estimated 10% of current NHS staff are Muslim. Prominent faith leaders including the archbishop of Canterbury (who announced this week he was standing down), the most senior Catholic leader in England and Wales, several imams, and the chief rabbi, have stated their opposition to assisted dying in recent weeks. Christian Concern, an evangelical organisation that supports legal cases involving Christian workers including NHS staff, said it was planning to \u201cresist the bill at every stage\u201d but would \u201cdo all we can to ensure conscientious objection\u201d should it become law. Mark Pickering, a doctor and the chief executive of the Christian Medical Fellowship, whose membership includes about 4,500 doctors, nurses and midwives, said a \u201cconscience clause\u201d may provide only limited protection. \u201cI don\u2019t foresee a situation in which anyone is forced to actually prescribe the medication for somebody to kill themselves. But, for instance in Canada, there have been significant problems around conscience.\u201d A spokesperson for Leadbeater said: \u201cChristian, Muslims and others are protected and cannot be subject to any detriment from their employer for choosing not to participate.\u201d Under Canadian law, healthcare professionals who object to assisted dying are required to make an \u201ceffective referral\u201d to a medic who is willing to provide the service. \u201cMany of our members would see that as morally problematic. Because if you say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to shoot granny, but I\u2019ll send her to someone who will\u2019, there isn\u2019t much moral difference,\u201d said Pickering. David Randall, a renal consultant, said his Christian faith had influenced his opposition to assisted dying, but his primary concerns were about the risks to vulnerable people and the relationship of trust between doctor and patient. The issue of assisted dying was \u201cso far away from what I experience in the multi-ethnic, deprived areas of London where I work. One of the biggest issues is the lack of trust in medicine\u201d. Randall said he saw people presenting late with advanced kidney disease because of a reluctance to consult their GP. Some were suspicious about treatment and care, and were sometimes unwilling to engage in discussions about palliative care as they saw it as a way of rationing costly treatment. \u201cThese people already face significant health inequalities in our society. There is a lot of suspicion about assisted suicide among ethnic minority communities, some of it cultural, some of it religious. A lot of them feel this is a way of denying them health care. Assisted suicide is not being driven by ethnic minority or deprived communities,\u201d he said. Even with a \u201cconscience clause\u201d included in legislation, he said: \u201cI can\u2019t see it taking long before doctors are required to open conversations with patients about assisted suicide, and that\u2019s not something I\u2019m willing to do.\u201d A survey of members of the British Islamic Medical Association this year found that about nine out of 10 opposed doctors prescribing or administering life-ending medication, and 56% said the legalisation of assisted dying would affect their choice of career. Nadia Khan, a palliative medicine consultant in Birmingham, said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of Muslim healthcare professionals were against the assisted dying bill \u201cbecause of practical and ethical concerns, quite apart from their religious beliefs\u201d. Many would face \u201cmoral distress\u201d if assisted dying were legalised, even with the provision of a \u201cconscience clause\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to allow conscientious objection on paper, but in practice it\u2019s not easy,\u201d said Khan. \u201cFor a proportion of Muslim health care professionals, assisted dying would impact their choice of career. And it would be likely to affect the specialisms people choose.\u201d There are also healthcare professionals who support assisted dying, sometimes because of witnessing painful and distressing deaths.

There was currently \u201can unsatisfactory and unsustainable situation where those who desire more end-of-life choice are in essence abandoned by the system and forced to seek control in dangerous, unenviable ways\u201d, he said in written evidence. In July, members of the Royal College of Nursing narrowly passed a motion supporting the \u201cprinciples of assisted dying\u201d. Cat Gibbons, an emergency care nurse from Oxfordshire, said during the debate: \u201cA nurse is somebody who is an advocate for a patient. No matter our own beliefs, I think we should support our patients\u2019 decisions if they believe assisted dying is right for them.\u201d \u2022 This article\u2019s main headline was amended on Friday 29 November to better reflect the opening paragraph.",

      "bodyText": "Australia go 1-0 up in the three game series, we\u2019ll be back to bring you the second match on Saturday. Thanks for your company and for sticking with us through the storm. Goodbye! A word from each captain: Josh Inglis: A really nice win, the boys really applied themselves and it was great to get a win after the ODI series. The bowlers did a great job taking wickets early and they executed everything they tried.\u201d Mohammad Rizwan: It was difficult to keep things normal in a seven-over game! We\u2019ve got to give credit to Maxy - his style worked really well.\u201d Glenn Maxwell bags the Player of the Match award for his hugely entertaining 43 off 19 balls: Had a lot of fun out there! We thought we had enough on the board. There was a little bit of tackiness in the wicket. The bowlers did a great job. There was a few of us who had packed our bags expecting the game to be called off so it was a mad rush to get ready. Credit to the guys (groundstaff).\u201d And breathe. That was a bonkers game but good they got out there, at one stage it looked like the whole thing was going to be kiboshed by storms lingering around Brisbane. Pakistan\u2019s innings was enough to send an OBO scribe scuttling for cover, frenetic is an understatement. Australia take the win and lead the series 1-0, though I\u2019m not sure how much you can read into that severely shortened freewheelin\u2019 thrash. Two in two balls, stumps all over the shop. You know what that means\u2026 6th over: Pakistan 53-7 (Abbas Afridi 19, Shaheen 1) Abbas Afridi strikes a four down the ground but it ain\u2019t enough. Pakistan need 40 off the final over. Adam Zampa is summoned to close it out/bowl the worst over of his life. Suckered with the slower ball, Khan holes out to the man on the deep midwicket fence. 5th over: Pakistan 47-6 (Khan 12, Abbas Afridi 15) Abbas Afridi slog sweeps Spencer Johnson over deep square leg for SIX! What a shot! The batter then follows up with a nonchalant scoop down to fine leg for four. A single brings Haseebullah Khan on strike and he pings a SIX down the ground that Tim David tries to claw back in but can only parry over the sponge. EIGHTEEN runs off the over and NO WICKETS. Pakistan need 47 off 12 balls. They couldn\u2019t, could they? May as well post this for the second time during this blog: 4th over: Pakistan 29-6 (Khan 5, Abbas Afridi 4) Abbas Afridi and Haseebullah Khan join forces with Pakistan needing an awful lot off not very many with hardly any left. Apart from that\u2026 Another swish across the line sees a top edge loop to Inglis behind the stumps. This is a nuts innings. 3rd over: Pakistan 20-5 (Khan 4, Agha) Haseebullah Khan slices over point for four. Keep up won\u2019t you! Crikey. Chalk it up. Fraser-McGurk takes another good catch in the deep. Pakistan in the mire at the Gabba. Goodnight Viennetta? Babar watched the wickets tumble last over and holes out off Nathan Ellis\u2019 first ball of the next. The slower delivery did for him, didn\u2019t time it and the ball fell to the man positioned inside the sponge. Usman Khan comes to the crease and can\u2019t lay a bat on Bartlett. Three dots. That\u2019s better \u2013 a lovely lofted drive for four from Khan. Pakistan can\u2019t afford to take their foot off the gas BUT THE WHEELS ARE COMING OFF as Khan shovels a catch to deep third! Bartlett has two wickets in the over. 2nd over: Pakistan 16-3 (Babar 3) Uh-oh. Rizwan gets a leading edge off a flick and it loops to backward point. Xavier Bartlett strikes with his first ball! 1st over: Pakistan 12-1 (Rizwan 0, Babar 3) Babar Azam joins Rizwan and swats his first ball away for three runs. Better to burn out than to fade away\u2026 Farhan gets a short ball too high on the bat and is easily caught. That was fun. Sahibzada Farhan serves up the one two punch to get Pakistan off to a flier! Spencer Johnson is launched over mid-off for four first ball and the pulled away over midwicket for more of the same! Here we go, Rizwan and Farhan stride out and look like the mean business. Chase incoming! This was his first ball btw Phew. That was thrashtastic. Back soon for Pakistan\u2019s response! Marcus Stoinis opens up those Serengeti wide shoulders to plunder TWENTY runs off Naseem Shah\u2019s final over. A lofted on drive for SIX the highlight, a flurry of twos and two boundaries cut away through the off side. Advantage Australia! 7th over: Australia 93-4-(Stoinis 21, Inglis 0) 6th over: Australia 73-4-(Stoinis 1, Inglis) Captain Inglis joins Stoinis in the middle, we\u2019ve got one over left and Naseem Shah looks like he is going to bowl it. Australia look to be setting a commanding total at the Gabba. Tim David shows off his long levers by shovelling a short ball for SIX but then has to go off the next as Farhan takes a good catch at mid on with a player converging in his eyeline. A slice over cover from Maxwell brings him and Australia two but The Big Show comes to an end the next ball as Abbas digs in a short ball that Maxwell slaps straight to Usman Khan on the deep square boundary. It was lots of fun while it lasted. 5th over: Australia 64-2 (Maxwell 41, David 4) Maxwell winds up a big moose over the leg side and is lucky to get a thick outside edge that flies away over Rizwan behind the stumps for four. SIX! Maxwell connects this time and deposits over cow corner for a biggie. Rauf goes full but Maxwell reads him, opens up his body and swats him over mid off for SIX more! Rauf goes short with pace off, Maxwell can\u2019t get it away but scampers the single to keep strike. 4th over: Australia 45-2 (Maxwell 24, David 3) Maxwell drops to his knees and nails a reverse lap/sweep off Shaheen Shah Afridi flat for SIX! What a shot that is. Maxwell at his Box Office best. Shaheen goes from short to full and manages to get out of the over for the cost of only a couple more runs. 3rd over: Australia 36-1 (Maxwell 17, David 1) Tim David arrives in the middle and drives to cover to get off the mark. Australia have their heavy artillery out in the middle. A wicket and and just three runs of Rauf\u2019s first over. Pakistan punch back through Haris Rauf. The bowler spears a couple in at Maxwell - who he pocketed three times in nine balls in the ODI series \u2013 before Short holes out to Babar at deep midwicket. 2nd over: Australia 33-1 (Short 7, Maxwell 16) Glenn Maxwell is the new batter and he reverse laps his first ball from Naseem Shah for four. What a shot to play first up, didn\u2019t nail it but got enough of it and the audacity was off the scale. FREE HIT! Naseem over steps by a country mile and Maxwell reverse laps the freebie over the keeper for four. Slap! Maxwell steps to leg and crunches over the off side for four more. Shah goes full in search of the yorker but Maxwell is on it in a flash, cracking his wrists and lofting down the ground for four. SEVENTEEN RUNS off the over. Australia are ticking. Five overs to go. Frenetic stuff, steam coming off my keyboard. Slapped straight to cover! Australia lose their first wicket and Fraser-McGurk has to drag himself from the middle. 1st over: Australia 16-0 (Short 7, Fraser-McGurk 9) Shaheen starts with a full bunger to Short who clips into the ring to get off the mark first ball. JFM on strike\u2026 and he works a full ball through midwicket for four! Lovely shot and top work from the groundstaff, the ball pinged away across the turf to the boundary and the wicket looks lovely\u2026 to bat on. Four more! JFM drives down the ground staight as an arrow. Proper cricket shot. The next ball sees him have a wild hack and connect with nothing but fresh air. Next up is a step away and a bunt down the ground for a single. SIX! Short top edges over fine leg and the ball soars high over the rope and into the stands. SIXTEEN runs off the first over. Gulp. Right then, here come the players. Jake Fraser-McGurk and Matthew Short to open up for Australia. They stride out to the middle through some dry-ice and smoke. Shaheen Shah Afridi is going to start with the new ball. I imagine this will all be quite high octane. Buckle up knuckleheads! Here are the teams: Australia: Jake Fraser-McGurk, Matt Short, Josh Inglis (c/wk), Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Aaron Hardie, Xavier Bartlett, Nathan Ellis, Adam Zampa, Spencer Johnson Pakistan: Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan (c/wk), Sahibzada Farhan, Usman Khan, Salman Agha, Irfan Khan, Abbas Afridi, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haseebullah Khan, Haris Rauf, Naseem Shah Rizwan calls the coin correctly and fancies a bowl under lights in damp and brooding conditions. The updated regs are that two bowlers can bowl two overs each and three can bowl one over each. Oh and theres a two over PowerPlay. Got it? The toss is imminent and play is due to start at 8.20pm. It will be a seven over match. You didn\u2019t expect that did you? Update: It has stopped raining in Brisbane and there\u2019s a sniff of a chance that we might get a five over game in if the weather stays clear and the ground team can get cleaned up in time for an 8.30pm start time. Stand by your beds! No news is probably bad news in Brisbane. Need those dark clouds to get a wiggle on. A bit like this: \u201cHi from Brisbane\u2019s West End, a few kilometres from The Gabba.\u201d Hello to you Phil Kerr. \u201cOne hour past the scheduled first ball, the sky is full of sound and fury, signifying not very much. Riffing on your Bob Dylan reference: tonight Brisbane has the Rolling Thunder Revue.\u201d Let\u2019s hope we don\u2019t find ourselves on the Desolation Row of a washout, Phil. Hopefully the worst of the storms are passing to the north of the ground. We may be able to get a shortened game in, I\u2019ll bring you any official news as soon as we get it. The latest we can start is is 8:30 PM (AEDT) Time) and that\u2019ll be for a 5-over Slogapalooza. Lightning has started to strike around the ground. No chance of them getting out there any time soon I\u2019m afraid. In the meantime, why not take a look at some of the cricket pieces we\u2019ve published in the last few days. First up \u2013 the Don of the sporting interview Don McRae sat down with a reflective and revealing chat with Jimmy Anderson: He pauses when I ask what would have happened to him without cricket. \u201cIt\u2019s a great question,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea. I did sixth form and thought of going to uni if I didn\u2019t get a contract. I didn\u2019t have a clue what I was going to do if cricket didn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s frightening because I\u2019m sure there\u2019re many people in that same position and they don\u2019t have that something I loved with a passion. I feel so fortunate I had cricket.\u201d His wife, Daniella, was furious when England discarded him as a player. Is she still angry now that Anderson is back in the fold as the Test bowling coach? \u201cI think so, yes. She\u2019s been my biggest supporter from when we first met. I had injuries and she was the one who motivated me to get going again. She just felt it wasn\u2019t the right way to have done things. She felt I should go on my own terms. But I think it\u2019s easing now.\u201d Hello Sam MacAulay! That sausage looks like it could be useful in whacking away any lightning that comes your way. No further comments, your honour. Go easy on the steins, we might still have a job to do here. We can squeeze in a five over game if get on the park before 8.30pm local time. (hic) I\u2019m not having this. As if things didn\u2019t feel apocalyptic enough right now\u2026 A Hard Raiiiiiiiin\u2019s a Gonna Fall? Bob Dylan was in London the other night, very much enjoyed this review. An artist who pronounced himself freewheelin\u2019 in 1963 seems no more inclined to keep to any script 61 years on. Best to stick close to the guy in charge and keep your eyes peeled for clues as to where he\u2019s headed. As they hawkishly follow his unpredictable vocal phrasing and a piano style that\u2019s simultaneously florid and ragged \u2013 Art Tatum by way of Les Dawson \u2013 he\u2019s still capable of wrongfooting them: there are moments when you could swear the band start building to a climax or slowing to a conclusion, only to discover their leader has other ideas. Reports of sonic boom level thunderclaps around the stadium. Are you in earshot, any OBOers local and got the skinny on the storms? Drop us a line in the usual way, links on the left flank of this page. Some wet weather reading? Martin Pegan has got you covered as he digs into how time waits for no man, not even Australian cricketers: Australian cricket has had several reminders that Father Time remains undefeated. The lingering effects of an end for every cricketer and every era have been hammered home in recent decades as fallow years have followed bumper crops of all-conquering Australians. Yet it remains to be seen whether the lessons of the past have truly been learned as the current men\u2019s Test team starts another summer of cricket rolling towards a cliff edge. Batten down the hatches Mr Binnacle! Gah, as the sky turns from inky black to gun metal grey here in south London it seems Brisbane is having a touch of English weather with storms in the area and pesky rain falling. The Gabba covers are well and truly on at the minute but I\u2019ll keep you updated, my sources tell me that we\u2019ll get some cricket in and it won\u2019t be a total washout. For now, we wait. Hello, good evening/morning and welcome to the first T20 between Australia and Pakistan at the Gabba. Australia are licking their wounds after a shock series defeat in the ODI series, Pakistan\u2019s first white ball series win Down Under since 2002 was really well deserved, coming from behind to snatch a 2-1 victory with some searing pace and assured batting. Some believe that the Aussie white ball wounds are somewhat self inflicted, with an understrength side on show and plenty of big names missing in action. Well, welcome to world cricket in 2024. Mitch Marsh and Travis Head\u2019s absence does allow others to come to the fore and make a name for themselves on the international scene, Jake Fraser-McGurk and Matthew Short will open the batting together in the format for the first time and there is plenty of new blood in the Aussie bowling line up. Josh Inglis and his side are looking to bounce back whilst Pakistan are on the hunt for the double, let\u2019s find out who prospers! Play begins in a little over 30 minutes and I\u2019ll be back with the teams and the toss in just a tickle.",

Jesse Rabinowitz, campaign and communications director at the National Homelessness Law Center, said his organization had seen at least 60 cities pass \u201canti-homeless, anti-camping laws\u201d, and at least 40 additional cities have pending legislation.</p> <p>In California, which is home to the <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/san-francisco/2024/01/04/california-homeless-statistics-high\">largest</a> unsheltered homeless population in the US, Governor Gavin Newsom cited Grants Pass when he signed an <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-Encampments-EO-7-24.pdf\">executive order</a> requiring cities to make reasonable efforts to clear encampments and threatening <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/08/10/nx-s1-5069741/california-governor-threatens-funding-cuts-for-counties-that-dont-remove-homeless-encampments\">reduced funding</a> for cities that fail to do so.</p>    <p>In the wake of Newsom\u2019s order, Berkeley, and neighboring Oakland, both made it easier for authorities to remove encampments. The changes, the activists say, unfairly target people of color, people with disabilities and senior citizens who are <a href=\"https://everyonehome.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-Centering-Racial-Equity-in-Homeless-System-Design-Full-Report-FINAL.pdf\">disproportionately</a> represented in the unhoused population, and they are not planning to end their occupation until they are rolled back.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you see these tents, it\u2019s unhoused individuals fighting back and having a voice \u2026 And wherever you see these tents, you will see us protecting them,\u201d Henson said.</p> <p>Organizers say the encampments are meant to be a safe place for residents displaced from existing encampments across the East Bay. There\u2019s 24/7 access to community, food, water and restrooms. At Ohlone Park, organizers have created a free store. Protesters say they will also be demanding legal protections for unhoused people living in encampments, similar to the due process rights afforded to <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/media/Tenant-Protection-Act-Landlords-and-Property-Managers-English.pdf\">tenants</a> during evictions.</p> <p>The demonstrators are \u201ctrying to find what public spaces we can, for people to be in a place where they feel stable and safe, and be publicly visible\u201d, said Gordon Gilmore, of the Berkeley Outreach Coalition and Berkeley Homeless Union, who lives in his van and helped organize the protest. \u201cTo be staying with the community means that you\u2019re in a safer situation.\u201d</p>    <p>***</p> <p>Homelessness has been an enduring problem in California, a consequence of the state\u2019s decades long housing supply shortage and affordability <a href=\"https://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/research-and-policy/bay-area-housing-public-funding/\">crisis</a>. Despite <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/commentary/2024/10/california-cost-to-end-homelessness/\">$24</a>bn allocated by state leadership to address the crisis in the last five fiscal years, encampments persist and elected officials are <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/01/gavin-newsom-california-homelessness-crisis-00176949\">under pressure</a> to make them disappear.</p> <p>In Berkeley, the city council voted in September to amend its <a href=\"https://berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2024-09-10%20Item%2037%20Encampment%20Policy%20Resolution.pdf\">encampment management policy.</a> Mait\u00e9e Rossoukhi, a spokesperson for the city, said the update made Berkeley \u201cthe first jurisdiction we are aware of in the nation to voluntarily codify the Martin v Boise standard\u201d, referring to the ruling the supreme court overruled with its Grants Pass decision. That means Berkeley will make sure to have \u201cshelter available before closing the vast majority of encampments\u201d, Rossoukhi said.</p> <p>But the new policy also created six emergency exceptions in which authorities can remove unhoused people from public spaces regardless of whether shelter is available. Those exceptions include when encampments block walkways or pose what the city deems to be a fire or public health risk. In those cases, officials can also arrest and fine anyone who doesn\u2019t comply. An October <a href=\"https://berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2024-10-7%20Implementation%20of%20Berkeley%E2%80%99s%20New%20Encampment%20Policy.pdf\">memo</a> detailing the policy\u2019s implementation states that \u201cstaff will resort to enforcement only if all other service offers and attempts to achieve voluntary compliance have failed\u201d.</p> <p>Berkeley city council member Cecilia Lunaparra, who cast the lone dissenting vote to the amended regulations, argues that the creation of the exceptions in effect \u201cmakes it nearly impossible to be unhoused in Berkeley without violating the Berkeley Municipal Code\u201d, since nearly all homeless encampments fall under one of the exceptions.</p> <p>In neighboring Oakland, the former mayor Sheng Thao in September issued an <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/y5a7iltaznj417pxaiywn/Executive-Order-2024.pdf?rlkey=0x9n7qxig961s3ev0rv486slg&amp;e=1&amp;st=vj55dixj&amp;dl=0%29\">executive order</a> that expanded her city\u2019s ability to sweep its estimated <a href=\"https://oaklandside.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/View-Report-15.pdf\">1,500</a> encampments, creating similar exceptions that expedite the removal process if an encampment is deemed harmful to critical infrastructure, or poses a public safety risk. The changes also reduced the required notification time before certain sweeps to as little as 12 hours. The order, announced amid a campaign to <a href=\"https://sfstandard.com/2024/11/05/pamela-price-sheng-thao-recalls-result/\">recall</a> Thao and a series of planned sweeps across the city, states that \u201cin no case, will emergency or urgent closures be delayed for shelter unavailability\u201d.</p> <p>Berkeley has not conducted any major sweeps since the policy changes passed, though organizers said residents of smaller encampments have received verbal notice to relocate. Oakland has undertaken weekly <a href=\"https://www.oaklandca.gov/topics/encampment-management-team\">cleanup operations</a>. The city of Oakland did not respond to requests for comment about the policy change.</p> <p>****</p> <p>Neither Berkeley nor Oakland have enough shelter capacity to cover its unhoused residents. Berkeley\u2019s availability fluctuates daily, the city said, with approximately <a href=\"https://berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Revised%20Agenda%20Material%20-%20Item%2016.pdf\">350</a> beds available in both congregate and non-congregate to serve an unhoused population that was estimated in January to be 844, nearly 400 of whom were unsheltered. Oakland\u2019s 1,627 beds, including group facilities, cabins and RV parking sites, serve an estimated 5,500 people, over 3,600 of them unsheltered.</p> <p>The number of unhoused people in both cities, collected through the US Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s annual Point in Time Count, is widely thought to <a href=\"https://homelesslaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/HUD-PIT-report2017.pdf\">underestimate</a> the scale of homelessness.</p> <p>And even when beds are available, <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.law.seattleu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=hrap\">barriers</a> to entry are manifold, advocates, attorneys and outreach workers said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a huge civil rights issue,\u201d said Brigitte Nicoletti of the East Bay Community Law Center.</p>    <p>Nicoletti described clients in encampments whose physical and mental health disabilities prevent them from accessing available options. Sometimes shelter buildings can\u2019t accommodate wheelchair users, she said. For those with mental health conditions, living in congregate settings can be challenging, while others struggle with strict and varying rules and requirements at different facilities. Shelters often don\u2019t provide parking or enough storage for belongings, she and others said.</p> <p>Even more lacking are long-term housing solutions that could set unhoused people on a permanent track out of homelessness. The Berkeley Housing Authority said that wait lists for entry into subsidized housing can take up to 12 years. The Oakland Housing Authority said that it can take from two years to nearly a <a href=\"https://abc7news.com/ca-affordable-housing-oakland-choice-voucher-hud-department-of/13212762/\">decade</a> to access public housing through its various voucher programs.</p> <p>Stepped-up encampment sweeps risk stalling efforts to get people into stable housing, argued Ian Cordova Morales, the board president of Where Do We Go Berkeley? and a housing navigator for Oakland\u2019s Homeless Action Center.</p> <p>The application for supportive housing in Alameda county, where Oakland is located, can take up to two years, Cordova Morales said, and requires that his clients obtain all necessary identification and documents, as well as proof of a source of income, before they can qualify. \u201cAnd then a sweep happens, and we can\u2019t find them, and they miss these housing matches,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Nicoletti said that during sweeps, people with disabilities, common among her unhoused clients, \u201care especially prone to having their belongings thrown away \u2013 everything from their tents, their vehicles, IDs, paperwork\u201d.</p> <p>Olivia deBree, associate medical director of the street medicine program at <a href=\"https://berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/legislative-body-meeting-attachments/LLMC_StreetMedOverviewandMedical_102024_CoB.pdf\">Lifelong Medical Care</a> warned that residents forced out of encampments can no longer get vital services such as addiction treatment, psychiatric injections, prenatal care, cancer treatment, HIV prevention and wound care.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Since they launched, Berkeley\u2019s protest encampments have become a haven of community and support, said Erin Spencer, a military veteran and resident of Berkeley\u2019s Eighth and Harrison Street encampment.</p> <p>\u201cI know that there\u2019s a bunch of people that I can go to \u2026 and we have to have social contact. We\u2019re social creatures. Without it, we go crazy and die like Tom Hanks in Castaway<em>,</em> right?\u201d</p> <p>Spencer relocated to Eighth and Harrison in 2021 after city officials <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/09/01/does-sleeping-on-the-street-make-this-disabled-marine-corps-veteran-a-criminal/\">swept</a> him from University Avenue and Frontage Road. Later, another sweep forced him from his tent at Emeryville\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.berkeleyside.org/2021/09/28/homeless-residents-allowed-stay-ashby-shellmound-encampment-6-months\">Ashby/Shellmound</a> encampment. Like others in support of the protest, he explained that contrary to the perception that they are dangerous, encampments are like any other neighborhood. Residents provide each other with vital community support. \u201cThere\u2019s a trust factor there,\u201d Spencer said.</p>    <p>According to Cordova Morales, this is ultimately what the group is protesting \u2013 the breakdown of American communities.</p> <p>Berkeley says it has made progress in tackling the homelessness crisis. In July, the city claimed it saw a <a href=\"https://berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2024-07-09%20Item%2016%20Referral%20Response%20%20Gap%20Analysis%20of%20Berkeley%E2%80%99s%20Homelessness.pdf\">45% reduction</a> in unsheltered homelessness since 2023, through the use of state funds to create non-congregate shelter options and a series of policy changes in 2022 meant to improve city communication with unhoused residents, reduce police involvement in encampment removals and install fire safety regulations and regular trash collection services at encampment sites.</p> <p>The city is also planning to use funds made available by Newsom to lease a 27-bed motel and expand the city\u2019s non-congregate shelter bed count to 120. Lunaparra, the city council member, expressed support for the proposal but emphasized that she wished the \u201cgovernor was distributing it not only to cities \u2026 that are willing to clear encampments without first offering shelter\u201d.</p> <p>Newsom said his statewide strategy was aimed at \u201c[getting] people off the streets and sidewalks. We got to get them out of these tents and encampments. However, we can do that in a compassionate and thoughtful way to stabilize folks, to create, as we say in psychology, a pattern interrupt, to give people service connections \u2026\u201d</p> <p>But until sweeps are no longer a part of that strategy, the occupiers and their encampments will remain in full sight.</p> <p>Gilmore put it simply: that it\u2019s time for the housed public to stop viewing encampments as a \u201ctraffic obstruction\u201d and face the humanity of the people who live there.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to push us out of view any more,\u201d he said.</p>",

The changes, the activists say, unfairly target people of color, people with disabilities and senior citizens who are disproportionately represented in the unhoused population, and they are not planning to end their occupation until they are rolled back. \u201cWhen you see these tents, it\u2019s unhoused individuals fighting back and having a voice \u2026 And wherever you see these tents, you will see us protecting them,\u201d Henson said. Organizers say the encampments are meant to be a safe place for residents displaced from existing encampments across the East Bay. There\u2019s 24/7 access to community, food, water and restrooms. At Ohlone Park, organizers have created a free store. Protesters say they will also be demanding legal protections for unhoused people living in encampments, similar to the due process rights afforded to tenants during evictions. The demonstrators are \u201ctrying to find what public spaces we can, for people to be in a place where they feel stable and safe, and be publicly visible\u201d, said Gordon Gilmore, of the Berkeley Outreach Coalition and Berkeley Homeless Union, who lives in his van and helped organize the protest. \u201cTo be staying with the community means that you\u2019re in a safer situation.\u201d *** Homelessness has been an enduring problem in California, a consequence of the state\u2019s decades long housing supply shortage and affordability crisis. Despite $24bn allocated by state leadership to address the crisis in the last five fiscal years, encampments persist and elected officials are under pressure to make them disappear. In Berkeley, the city council voted in September to amend its encampment management policy. Mait\u00e9e Rossoukhi, a spokesperson for the city, said the update made Berkeley \u201cthe first jurisdiction we are aware of in the nation to voluntarily codify the Martin v Boise standard\u201d, referring to the ruling the supreme court overruled with its Grants Pass decision. That means Berkeley will make sure to have \u201cshelter available before closing the vast majority of encampments\u201d, Rossoukhi said. But the new policy also created six emergency exceptions in which authorities can remove unhoused people from public spaces regardless of whether shelter is available. Those exceptions include when encampments block walkways or pose what the city deems to be a fire or public health risk. In those cases, officials can also arrest and fine anyone who doesn\u2019t comply. An October memo detailing the policy\u2019s implementation states that \u201cstaff will resort to enforcement only if all other service offers and attempts to achieve voluntary compliance have failed\u201d. Berkeley city council member Cecilia Lunaparra, who cast the lone dissenting vote to the amended regulations, argues that the creation of the exceptions in effect \u201cmakes it nearly impossible to be unhoused in Berkeley without violating the Berkeley Municipal Code\u201d, since nearly all homeless encampments fall under one of the exceptions. In neighboring Oakland, the former mayor Sheng Thao in September issued an executive order that expanded her city\u2019s ability to sweep its estimated 1,500 encampments, creating similar exceptions that expedite the removal process if an encampment is deemed harmful to critical infrastructure, or poses a public safety risk. The changes also reduced the required notification time before certain sweeps to as little as 12 hours. The order, announced amid a campaign to recall Thao and a series of planned sweeps across the city, states that \u201cin no case, will emergency or urgent closures be delayed for shelter unavailability\u201d. Berkeley has not conducted any major sweeps since the policy changes passed, though organizers said residents of smaller encampments have received verbal notice to relocate. Oakland has undertaken weekly cleanup operations. The city of Oakland did not respond to requests for comment about the policy change. **** Neither Berkeley nor Oakland have enough shelter capacity to cover its unhoused residents. Berkeley\u2019s availability fluctuates daily, the city said, with approximately 350 beds available in both congregate and non-congregate to serve an unhoused population that was estimated in January to be 844, nearly 400 of whom were unsheltered. Oakland\u2019s 1,627 beds, including group facilities, cabins and RV parking sites, serve an estimated 5,500 people, over 3,600 of them unsheltered. The number of unhoused people in both cities, collected through the US Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s annual Point in Time Count, is widely thought to underestimate the scale of homelessness. And even when beds are available, barriers to entry are manifold, advocates, attorneys and outreach workers said. \u201cThis is a huge civil rights issue,\u201d said Brigitte Nicoletti of the East Bay Community Law Center. Nicoletti described clients in encampments whose physical and mental health disabilities prevent them from accessing available options. Sometimes shelter buildings can\u2019t accommodate wheelchair users, she said. For those with mental health conditions, living in congregate settings can be challenging, while others struggle with strict and varying rules and requirements at different facilities. Shelters often don\u2019t provide parking or enough storage for belongings, she and others said. Even more lacking are long-term housing solutions that could set unhoused people on a permanent track out of homelessness. The Berkeley Housing Authority said that wait lists for entry into subsidized housing can take up to 12 years. The Oakland Housing Authority said that it can take from two years to nearly a decade to access public housing through its various voucher programs. Stepped-up encampment sweeps risk stalling efforts to get people into stable housing, argued Ian Cordova Morales, the board president of Where Do We Go Berkeley? and a housing navigator for Oakland\u2019s Homeless Action Center. The application for supportive housing in Alameda county, where Oakland is located, can take up to two years, Cordova Morales said, and requires that his clients obtain all necessary identification and documents, as well as proof of a source of income, before they can qualify. \u201cAnd then a sweep happens, and we can\u2019t find them, and they miss these housing matches,\u201d he said. Nicoletti said that during sweeps, people with disabilities, common among her unhoused clients, \u201care especially prone to having their belongings thrown away \u2013 everything from their tents, their vehicles, IDs, paperwork\u201d. Olivia deBree, associate medical director of the street medicine program at Lifelong Medical Care warned that residents forced out of encampments can no longer get vital services such as addiction treatment, psychiatric injections, prenatal care, cancer treatment, HIV prevention and wound care. *** Since they launched, Berkeley\u2019s protest encampments have become a haven of community and support, said Erin Spencer, a military veteran and resident of Berkeley\u2019s Eighth and Harrison Street encampment. \u201cI know that there\u2019s a bunch of people that I can go to \u2026 and we have to have social contact. We\u2019re social creatures. Without it, we go crazy and die like Tom Hanks in Castaway, right?\u201d Spencer relocated to Eighth and Harrison in 2021 after city officials swept him from University Avenue and Frontage Road. Later, another sweep forced him from his tent at Emeryville\u2019s Ashby/Shellmound encampment. Like others in support of the protest, he explained that contrary to the perception that they are dangerous, encampments are like any other neighborhood. Residents provide each other with vital community support. \u201cThere\u2019s a trust factor there,\u201d Spencer said. According to Cordova Morales, this is ultimately what the group is protesting \u2013 the breakdown of American communities. Berkeley says it has made progress in tackling the homelessness crisis. In July, the city claimed it saw a 45% reduction in unsheltered homelessness since 2023, through the use of state funds to create non-congregate shelter options and a series of policy changes in 2022 meant to improve city communication with unhoused residents, reduce police involvement in encampment removals and install fire safety regulations and regular trash collection services at encampment sites. The city is also planning to use funds made available by Newsom to lease a 27-bed motel and expand the city\u2019s non-congregate shelter bed count to 120. Lunaparra, the city council member, expressed support for the proposal but emphasized that she wished the \u201cgovernor was distributing it not only to cities \u2026 that are willing to clear encampments without first offering shelter\u201d. Newsom said his statewide strategy was aimed at \u201c[getting] people off the streets and sidewalks. We got to get them out of these tents and encampments. However, we can do that in a compassionate and thoughtful way to stabilize folks, to create, as we say in psychology, a pattern interrupt, to give people service connections \u2026\u201d But until sweeps are no longer a part of that strategy, the occupiers and their encampments will remain in full sight. Gilmore put it simply: that it\u2019s time for the housed public to stop viewing encampments as a \u201ctraffic obstruction\u201d and face the humanity of the people who live there. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to push us out of view any more,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<h2>10. The Brown Bunny (2003)</h2> <p>Kudos to Sevigny for fully committing herself to fellating her director and co-star, Vincent Gallo, in the sleaziest, least necessary scene in his downbeat, 1970s-style road movie. Elsewhere, the driving sequences are mesmerising, but I must be careful what I write about the iffy sexual politics since Gallo once called me a <a href=\"https://multiglom.com/2012/09/04/vincent-gallo-versus-the-critics/\">\u201ccommie lesbian witch\u201d</a>.</p> <h2>9. Dogville (2003)</h2>    <p>Despite a frizzy perm, Sevigny blends seamlessly into the starry ensemble cast of Lars Von Trier\u2019s Brechtian morality play in which the houses in a Depression-era town are represented by white lines on a soundstage. Nicole Kidman seeks refuge from mobsters there, only for the townsfolk\u2019s charity to turn into exploitation, exposing America\u2019s underbelly in a gripping avant-garde experiment.</p> <h2>8. Trees Lounge (1996)</h2>    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/steve-buscemi\">Steve Buscemi</a>, a regular fixture of American independent cinema, stars in his own indie writing-directing debut. It\u2019s a droll, low-key, beautifully observed study of an alcoholic who drives an ice-cream truck and becomes perilously involved with his ex-girlfriend\u2019s 17-year-old niece \u2013 a precociously self-possessed performance by Sevigny in her follow-up to Kids.</p> <h2>7. Kids (1995)</h2>    <p>Even before Sevigny\u2019s film acting debut hit cinemas, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jay-mcinerney\">Jay McInerney</a> described her as the coolest girl in the world in a New Yorker profile. And in Larry Clark\u2019s controversial study of young New York skate-punks doing drugs and having sex, she is unquestionably the main attraction, giving an effortlessly natural performance as Jennie, trying to track down the boy who took her virginity and left her HIV-positive.</p> <h2>6. Love &amp; Friendship (2016)</h2>    <p>Reuniting with Whit Stillman, her Last Days of Disco co-star and director, Sevigny swaps her usual kooky contemporaneity for period embonpoint in his delicious comedy of manners, inspired by an unfinished Jane Austen novel. She plays the American confidante to Kate Beckinsale\u2019s hilariously unscrupulous Lady Susan in a sparkling divertissement that vexed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/29/jane-austen-tiktok-generation-heroine-fans\">Janeites</a>, but delighted everyone else.</p> <h2>5. American Psycho (2000)</h2>    <p>As Jean, Patrick Bateman\u2019s long-suffering secretary, Sevigny is an oasis of relatability amid the gurning caricatures in Mary Harron\u2019s satirical adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis\u2019s controversial novel. So when Bateman (Christian Bale) invites Jean round to his pad and gets out his nail gun, you find yourself praying she gets out of there alive.</p> <h2>4. Boys Don\u2019t Cry (1999)</h2>    <p>Kimberly Peirce\u2019s heartbreaking dramatisation of the real-life tragedy of Brandon Teena, a young trans Nebraskan, won Hilary Swank an Academy award for best actress, while Sevigny received a best supporting nomination for her luminous performance as Lana, Brandon\u2019s girlfriend. Predictably, the US ratings system had more problems with the orgasmic expressions lighting up Lana\u2019s face during their love scene than with the rape and murder elsewhere in the film.</p> <h2>3. Gummo (1997)</h2>    <p>The It Girl teamed up again with her Kids screenwriter (and then-boyfriend) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/20/burned-out-started-mowing-lawns-reality-bending-harmony-korine\">Harmony Korine</a> for his directing debut. She plays the platinum-haired Dot, and also designed the costumes (including the iconic bunny ears) in a narrative-lite portrait of an impoverished \u201cwhite trash\u201d community in Ohio where weird-looking kids sniff glue and roller-skate on front lawns. Twenty-seven years ago I loathed it, but it\u2019s now clearly a work of near genius: poignant, funny and authentic, albeit requiring multiple content warnings.</p> <h2>2.

      "bodyText": "10. The Brown Bunny (2003) Kudos to Sevigny for fully committing herself to fellating her director and co-star, Vincent Gallo, in the sleaziest, least necessary scene in his downbeat, 1970s-style road movie. Elsewhere, the driving sequences are mesmerising, but I must be careful what I write about the iffy sexual politics since Gallo once called me a \u201ccommie lesbian witch\u201d. 9. Dogville (2003) Despite a frizzy perm, Sevigny blends seamlessly into the starry ensemble cast of Lars Von Trier\u2019s Brechtian morality play in which the houses in a Depression-era town are represented by white lines on a soundstage. Nicole Kidman seeks refuge from mobsters there, only for the townsfolk\u2019s charity to turn into exploitation, exposing America\u2019s underbelly in a gripping avant-garde experiment. 8. Trees Lounge (1996) Steve Buscemi, a regular fixture of American independent cinema, stars in his own indie writing-directing debut. It\u2019s a droll, low-key, beautifully observed study of an alcoholic who drives an ice-cream truck and becomes perilously involved with his ex-girlfriend\u2019s 17-year-old niece \u2013 a precociously self-possessed performance by Sevigny in her follow-up to Kids. 7. Kids (1995) Even before Sevigny\u2019s film acting debut hit cinemas, Jay McInerney described her as the coolest girl in the world in a New Yorker profile. And in Larry Clark\u2019s controversial study of young New York skate-punks doing drugs and having sex, she is unquestionably the main attraction, giving an effortlessly natural performance as Jennie, trying to track down the boy who took her virginity and left her HIV-positive. 6. Love &amp; Friendship (2016) Reuniting with Whit Stillman, her Last Days of Disco co-star and director, Sevigny swaps her usual kooky contemporaneity for period embonpoint in his delicious comedy of manners, inspired by an unfinished Jane Austen novel. She plays the American confidante to Kate Beckinsale\u2019s hilariously unscrupulous Lady Susan in a sparkling divertissement that vexed Janeites, but delighted everyone else. 5. American Psycho (2000) As Jean, Patrick Bateman\u2019s long-suffering secretary, Sevigny is an oasis of relatability amid the gurning caricatures in Mary Harron\u2019s satirical adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis\u2019s controversial novel. So when Bateman (Christian Bale) invites Jean round to his pad and gets out his nail gun, you find yourself praying she gets out of there alive. 4. Boys Don\u2019t Cry (1999) Kimberly Peirce\u2019s heartbreaking dramatisation of the real-life tragedy of Brandon Teena, a young trans Nebraskan, won Hilary Swank an Academy award for best actress, while Sevigny received a best supporting nomination for her luminous performance as Lana, Brandon\u2019s girlfriend. Predictably, the US ratings system had more problems with the orgasmic expressions lighting up Lana\u2019s face during their love scene than with the rape and murder elsewhere in the film. 3. Gummo (1997) The It Girl teamed up again with her Kids screenwriter (and then-boyfriend) Harmony Korine for his directing debut. She plays the platinum-haired Dot, and also designed the costumes (including the iconic bunny ears) in a narrative-lite portrait of an impoverished \u201cwhite trash\u201d community in Ohio where weird-looking kids sniff glue and roller-skate on front lawns. Twenty-seven years ago I loathed it, but it\u2019s now clearly a work of near genius: poignant, funny and authentic, albeit requiring multiple content warnings. 2. Demonlover (2002) Sevigny had to learn French dialogue phonetically for her role as an enigmatic secretary, yet pulls off a hellishly difficult metamorphosis from dogsbody into malevolent puppet-mistress when a glamorous industrial spy (Connie Nielsen) becomes obsessed with a torture pornography website. Olivier Assayas\u2019 film similarly morphs from slick cyberthriller into Videodrome-style hallucination in one of the most baffling, beguiling films of the 00s. 1. The Last Days of Disco (1998) \u201cChlo\u00eb is a natural phenomenon,\u201d said Whit Stillman, casting Sevigny in one of her best roles, as quiet but clever Alice, the key character in his enchanting portrait of preppies hanging out in early 1980s Manhattan. Loquaciousness is off the scale, especially from Kate Beckinsale, delivering a stream of outrageously backhanded remarks as Alice\u2019s frenemy. Happily, it\u2019s some of the wittiest dialogue in town, topped off by one of cinema\u2019s loveliest end credit sequences.",

But short-term memory problems linked to Alzheimer\u2019s disease could intermittently make it difficult for him to assist the attorneys defending him, another key element of the constitutional definition of legal competence.</p> <p>Campbell ordered Hecker to undergo regular medical evaluations. During the most recent of those, which was described in a report dated 10 November, Hecker \u201cwas again engaged and responded to questions appropriately\u201d, Drs Sarah Deland and Janet Johnson wrote.</p> <p>He understood that he would go to prison \u201cfor a long time\u201d \u2013 for the rest of his life, in fact \u2013 if he were to be eventually convicted as charged. He also expressed a willingness to work with his attorneys, whose names he knew, as well as an ability to deliver his version of events to them.</p> <p>Nonetheless, a 28 October report from the physician in charge of caring for him at the long-term care facility where he is being held in custody warned that Hecker\u2019s \u201cmental status waxes and wanes\u201d as it does for other people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u201cSome days, he is more alert than others\u201d, the physician, Michael Russo, wrote, adding that Hecker occasionally demonstrated confusion.</p> <p>The most recent report from Deland and Johnson declared Hecker \u201cmarginally competent\u201d and mirrored the findings of evaluations in September and October.</p> <p>Hecker\u2019s lead attorney, Robert Hjortsberg, said on Wednesday that he had read the latest medical report on his client. \u201cIf the doctors have determined him to be competent, then we will be ready for trial,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Campbell has set a final pair of preliminary hearing dates for 21 and 25 November, the second of which was scheduled for eight days before the tentative start of trial.</p> <p>The victim at the center of Hecker\u2019s pending trial maintains that he was an underage student at a Catholic high school to which Hecker had ties when the priest choked him unconscious and raped him in about 1975.</p> <p>The accuser has said he told his school principal about the rape, which unfolded in a space in a church bell tower that had been converted into a weightlifting room. But the accuser has said the principal, Paul Calamari, never alerted police and instead arranged for him to undergo psychological treatment.</p> <p>Hecker has denied that accusation. But in 1999, he did admit in writing to Catholic church leaders in New Orleans that he had molested or sexually harassed several other children whom he met through his work as a priest.</p> <p>New Orleans\u2019 Catholic archdiocese nonetheless allowed Hecker to return to work before retiring a few years later. The archdiocese then waited until 2018 to finally notify the public that Hecker \u2013 along with <a href=\"https://www.bishop-accountability.org/news2020/05_06/2020_05_19_Vargas_NewOrleans.htm\">Calamari</a> and dozens of their fellow clerics \u2013 had been the subject of substantial, credible child sexual abuse allegations that eventually drove the institution to file for bankruptcy protection in 2020.</p> <p>Despite a seal on information pertaining to the bankruptcy, the Guardian managed to obtain a copy of Hecker\u2019s 1999 admissions and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/20/new-orleans-priest-lawrence-hecker-child-abuse\">exposed them</a> to the public for the first time in June 2023.</p> <p>The Guardian then shared the confession with the New Orleans CBS affiliate WWL Louisiana, and both outlets confronted Hecker on camera in August 2023. During that interview, Hecker verified that his written confession was authentic.</p> <p>About two weeks after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/23/new-orleans-priest-admits-abusing-minors\">Guardian</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd0ZAiBLH8k\">WWL</a> published that conversation, the New Orleans district attorney, Jason Williams, secured a grand jury indictment charging Hecker in connection with the complaint at the heart of his pending case.</p> <p>It has been rare for Catholic clergymen in the city of New Orleans to be charged with \u2013 much less convicted of \u2013 crimes pertaining to the worldwide church\u2019s child molestation scandal.</p> <p>However, the law enforcement investigation into Hecker has since widened into an inquiry over whether the archdiocese ran a child-sex trafficking ring responsible for the \u201cwidespread \u2026 abuse of minors dating back decades\u201d that was \u201ccovered up and not reported\u201d to authorities, according to statements sworn under oath by police.</p> <p>None of Hecker\u2019s superiors have been charged with crimes in the unresolved case against him.</p> <p><em>\u2022 In the US, call or text the <a href=\"https://www.childhelp.org/hotline/\">Childhelp</a> abuse hotline on 800-422-4453 or visit <a href=\"https://www.childhelphotline.org/\">their website</a> for more resources and to report child abuse or DM for help.

But short-term memory problems linked to Alzheimer\u2019s disease could intermittently make it difficult for him to assist the attorneys defending him, another key element of the constitutional definition of legal competence. Campbell ordered Hecker to undergo regular medical evaluations. During the most recent of those, which was described in a report dated 10 November, Hecker \u201cwas again engaged and responded to questions appropriately\u201d, Drs Sarah Deland and Janet Johnson wrote. He understood that he would go to prison \u201cfor a long time\u201d \u2013 for the rest of his life, in fact \u2013 if he were to be eventually convicted as charged. He also expressed a willingness to work with his attorneys, whose names he knew, as well as an ability to deliver his version of events to them. Nonetheless, a 28 October report from the physician in charge of caring for him at the long-term care facility where he is being held in custody warned that Hecker\u2019s \u201cmental status waxes and wanes\u201d as it does for other people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u201cSome days, he is more alert than others\u201d, the physician, Michael Russo, wrote, adding that Hecker occasionally demonstrated confusion. The most recent report from Deland and Johnson declared Hecker \u201cmarginally competent\u201d and mirrored the findings of evaluations in September and October. Hecker\u2019s lead attorney, Robert Hjortsberg, said on Wednesday that he had read the latest medical report on his client. \u201cIf the doctors have determined him to be competent, then we will be ready for trial,\u201d he said. Campbell has set a final pair of preliminary hearing dates for 21 and 25 November, the second of which was scheduled for eight days before the tentative start of trial. The victim at the center of Hecker\u2019s pending trial maintains that he was an underage student at a Catholic high school to which Hecker had ties when the priest choked him unconscious and raped him in about 1975. The accuser has said he told his school principal about the rape, which unfolded in a space in a church bell tower that had been converted into a weightlifting room. But the accuser has said the principal, Paul Calamari, never alerted police and instead arranged for him to undergo psychological treatment. Hecker has denied that accusation. But in 1999, he did admit in writing to Catholic church leaders in New Orleans that he had molested or sexually harassed several other children whom he met through his work as a priest. New Orleans\u2019 Catholic archdiocese nonetheless allowed Hecker to return to work before retiring a few years later. The archdiocese then waited until 2018 to finally notify the public that Hecker \u2013 along with Calamari and dozens of their fellow clerics \u2013 had been the subject of substantial, credible child sexual abuse allegations that eventually drove the institution to file for bankruptcy protection in 2020. Despite a seal on information pertaining to the bankruptcy, the Guardian managed to obtain a copy of Hecker\u2019s 1999 admissions and exposed them to the public for the first time in June 2023. The Guardian then shared the confession with the New Orleans CBS affiliate WWL Louisiana, and both outlets confronted Hecker on camera in August 2023. During that interview, Hecker verified that his written confession was authentic. About two weeks after the Guardian and WWL published that conversation, the New Orleans district attorney, Jason Williams, secured a grand jury indictment charging Hecker in connection with the complaint at the heart of his pending case. It has been rare for Catholic clergymen in the city of New Orleans to be charged with \u2013 much less convicted of \u2013 crimes pertaining to the worldwide church\u2019s child molestation scandal. However, the law enforcement investigation into Hecker has since widened into an inquiry over whether the archdiocese ran a child-sex trafficking ring responsible for the \u201cwidespread \u2026 abuse of minors dating back decades\u201d that was \u201ccovered up and not reported\u201d to authorities, according to statements sworn under oath by police. None of Hecker\u2019s superiors have been charged with crimes in the unresolved case against him. \u2022 In the US, call or text the Childhelp abuse hotline on 800-422-4453 or visit their website for more resources and to report child abuse or DM for help.

      "bodyText": "Donation and electoral spending caps could pass parliament as early as this fortnight, with Labor confident the Coalition will help it block campaigns of the size run by Clive Palmer at the national level and teal independents at the local level. But the bill, to be introduced next week, could spark outrage from independents, emerging and minor parties, with plans to increase public funding of elections from $3.35 a vote to $5. The centrepiece of the bill is spending caps of: $90m for a federal political campaign; $800,000 for an individual electorate; and separate caps for each state and territory based on their size. Groups not running in elections will be limited to spending $11m on a federal campaign. Caps of that size will prevent campaigns on the scale of the more than $120m spent by Clive Palmer\u2019s United Australia party in 2022 and those of six successful teal independents at the same election, who each raised more than $1m. The plan, to be announced on Friday by the special minister of state, Don Farrell, is believed to have in-principle support from the opposition, setting the stage for introduction next week \u2013 and passage in the final sitting week of parliament for commencement in July 2026, after the 2025 election. However, the bill is yet to go through Coalition party room. A law for truth in political advertising will be introduced at the same time, but will require Senate crossbench support as it lacks Coalition backing. Labor proposes to cap spending and donations on a calendar year basis, with totals reset in the new year or after a federal election, and the level of caps indexed once per cycle after the election. Receipt of donations or gifts from an individual donor will be capped at $20,000 a candidate for independents or per state division for political parties. Donors will be prevented from giving an aggregate of 30 times the gift cap (initially $600,000), with separate limits in each state and territory. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Donations to bodies such as major party business forums will be captured, although union affiliation fees to Labor will not count towards the cap. The impact on funding aggregators such as Climate 200 is unclear, with suggestions that genuine pass-through of smaller individual donations may still be allowed. The bill will also include Labor\u2019s promised reforms for a $1,000 donation disclosure threshold, and real-time disclosure every month, down to every week during an election campaign and every day in the week before and after election day. In addition to candidates receiving $5 per vote, parties and independents will receive $30,000 per MP and $15,000 per senator each in administrative funding, to comply with the more onerous disclosure requirements. The regime includes penalties for breaches, which will apply from 2027, anti-avoidance provisions and increased compliance powers for the Australian Electoral Commission. Parties will be required to keep new federal campaign accounts to more easily track spending. Farrell said that \u201cyears of inquiries and evidence from multiple elections, show us that the biggest weakness to our electoral system is big money influencing our political system\u201d. \u201cThis significant package of reforms have been drafted to tackle big money in our electoral system and protect our democracy into the future,\u201d he said. Guardian Australia first revealed in July 2022 that the newly elected Albanese government intended to legislate electoral spending caps, as part of an ambitious policy suite not canvassed before the election. Spending and donations caps were backed by the joint standing committee on electoral matters in June 2023, but legislation has been more than two years in the making with Farrell keen to strike the balance between knocking big money out of politics and designing laws that can withstand challenge. In March, Palmer accused Labor of attempting to \u201csilence the diversity of ideas in this country\u201d, foreshadowing a likely high court challenge on the basis the caps breach the implied freedom of political communication. The high court has struck down more restrictive caps legislated in New South Wales by the Coalition government, while teal independents in Victoria have also threatened to challenge its campaign finance laws. In October 2023, the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, warned against \u201cdonation caps for challengers, [and] increased funding for incumbents\u201d, which he said ran the risk of being a form of \u201ccollusion\u201d designed to entrench major parties. Independents have proposed their own set of reforms in a bill including a cap on donations of $1.5m but without spending caps. In response, Farrell charged the independents with hypocrisy for \u201csaying to us that they agree with banning big money, just not theirs\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning. Israel has been accused of crimes against humanity over its use of evacuation orders to pursue the \u201cdeliberate and massive forced displacement\u201d of civilians in Gaza, in a report by Human Rights Watch. The organization said it had collected evidence that indicated \u201cthe war crime of forcible transfer [of the civilian population]\u201d, describing it as \u201ca grave breach of the Geneva conventions and a crime under the Rome statute of the international criminal court\u201d. It called for the international criminal court to investigate Israel\u2019s policy of forced displacement and recommended imposing sanctions, including ending arms sales. The report was published against the backdrop of growing evidence that Israel is intensifying its efforts to divide the Gaza Strip in two with a buffer zone, and that it plans a prolonged military presence. How much of Gaza\u2019s population has been displaced? More than 90%, with many civilians forced to move multiple times. What do the Geneva conventions say about displacement? That in occupied territories, civilians must be displaced only in exceptional circumstances \u2013 but Israel has used evacuation orders repeatedly. Many Republicans baffled by Trump\u2019s pick of \u2018reckless\u2019 Gaetz for attorney general Donald Trump\u2019s decision to nominate the far-right Republican congressman Matt Gaetz as attorney general has caused turmoil within his own party, with some expressing doubts that the Senate will confirm the appointment.

What\u2019s Gaetz\u2019s background? As a member of the Maga-aligned Freedom Caucus in the House, he led the successful charge to oust the former Republican House speaker Kevin McCarthy from his role. Why else might he be controversial? Though charges were never brought, he was investigated by the justice department in a sex-trafficking case involving children, and by the House ethics committee over allegations including sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. He denies wrongdoing.

The party will have only a slim majority in the House, especially as Trump has picked at least three House Republicans to join his administration. Who else has Trump selected for his cabinet from the House? Elise Stefanik, for UN ambassador; Mike Waltz for national security adviser; and, Gaetz for attorney general. What does that mean for the Republican majority? Serving in a president\u2019s cabinet means they will have to resign as representatives, and special elections will be held to replace them. In other news \u2026 Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders called on the Democratic party to demonstrate that it will \u201cunrig this economy\u201d in favor of ordinary Americans as the president-elect teams up with billionaires. Iranian authorities said they would create a treatment clinic for women who defied the country\u2019s mandatory hijab laws, prompting outrage from Iranian women and human rights groups. Charles Manson admitted to additional murders in a newly discovered prison phone call, according to the preview of a new docu-series. Stat of the day: Poorer nations need $1tn a year by 2030 in climate finance, top economists find Poorer countries need $1tn a year in climate finance by 2030, a study has found, while Cop29 leaders are negotiating over supplying this sum by 2035. Waiting until that deadline, the leading economists behind the research said, would damage vulnerable countries. Don\u2019t miss this: The rapid rise of Russia\u2019s powerful darknet drug industry Russia\u2019s drug market is evolving: hand-to-hand deals are becoming a thing of the past, with kladmen (stash men) uploading locations for \u201cdead drops\u201d, which are unlocked when buyers make an online purchase. Max Daly explains how Russia\u2019s markets have been taken over by a new wave of tech-smart organised crime groups, which use social media videos and encourage the public to mete out brutal punishments on disloyal kladmen. Climate check: \u2018Minimal progress\u2019 made this year on curbing global heating Earth is on track to heat by 2.7C by 2100, a report has found, far above the goal of 1.5C. This estimation \u2013 which would lead to profound human suffering \u2013 has not changed since 2021, with \u201cminimal progress\u201d made this year, according to the Climate Action Tracker project.

If Donald Trump eases permitting regulations, it could even lead to more clean energy coming online.\u201d</p> <p>At the UN Cop29 talks in Azerbaijan, which started on Monday, countries are again having to grapple with a bewildering swing in the US\u2019s commitment to confront the climate crisis.

Exports would also be hit, the analysis predicts, allowing US competitors to seize market share. \u201cThese plans suggest a complete misunderstanding of how the global economy works,\u201d said Allan. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have a manufacturing base, we aren\u2019t going to get ahead.\u201d Trump has talked of forging \u201cAmerican energy dominance\u201d that is based entirely upon fossil fuels, with more oil and gas drilling coupled with a pledge to scrap offshore wind projects and an end to the \u201clunacy\u201d of electric cars subsidies. The president-elect is expected to lead a wide-ranging dismantling of environmental and climate rules once he returns to the White House. These priorities, coming as peak global oil production is forecast and pressure mounts to avert climate breakdown, could further cement China\u2019s leadership in clean energy production. \u201cChina already feels puzzled and skeptical of the Inflation Reduction Act,\u201d said Li Shuo, a climate specialist at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \u201cThrow in Trump and you deepen Chinese skepticism. This is political boom and bust. When it comes to selling clean energy to third country markets, China isn\u2019t sweating at all.\u201d But even Trump\u2019s agenda is not expected to completely stall clean energy\u2019s momentum. Renewables are now economically attractive and are set to still grow, albeit more bumpily. Solar, which has plummeted by 90% in cost over the past decade, was added to the American grid at three times the rate of gas capacity last year, for example. \u201cWe will see a big effort to boost the supply of fossil fuels from the US but most drilling is at full blast anyway,\u201d said Ely Sandler, a climate finance expert at Harvard University\u2019s Belfer Center. \u201cThat\u2019s quite different from demand, which is how power is generated and usually comes down to the cheapest source of energy which is increasingly renewables. If Donald Trump eases permitting regulations, it could even lead to more clean energy coming online.\u201d At the UN Cop29 talks in Azerbaijan, which started on Monday, countries are again having to grapple with a bewildering swing in the US\u2019s commitment to confront the climate crisis. The outgoing Biden administration, which is trying to talk up ongoing American action at the talks, hopes its climate policies have enough juice to outlast a Trumpian assault. \u201cWhat we will see is whether we\u2019ve achieved escape velocity or not and how quickly the booster packs are about to fall off,\u201d said Ali Zaidi, Biden\u2019s top climate adviser, at the Cop summit.",

      "bodyText": "A political disaster such as what occurred last Tuesday gains significance not simply by virtue of who won or lost, but through how the election is interpreted. This is known as the Lesson of the election. The Lesson explains what happened and why. It deciphers the public\u2019s mood, values, and thoughts. It attributes credit and blame. And therein lies its power. When the Lesson of the election becomes accepted wisdom \u2013 when most of the politicians, pundits and journalists come to believe it \u2013 it shapes the future. It determines how parties, candidates, political operatives and journalists approach coming elections. What\u2019s the Lesson of the 2024 election? According to exit polls, Americans voted mainly on the economy \u2013 and their votes reflected their class and level of education. While the US economy has improved over the last two years according to standard economic measures, most Americans without college degrees \u2013 that\u2019s the majority \u2013 have not felt it. In fact, most Americans without college degrees have not felt much economic improvement for four decades, and their jobs have grown less secure. The real median wage of the bottom 90% is stuck nearly where it was in the early 1990s, even though the economy is more than twice as large now as it was then. Most of the economy\u2019s gains have gone to the top. This has caused many Americans to feel frustrated and angry. Trump gave voice to that anger. Harris did not. The real lesson of the 2024 election is that Democrats must not just give voice to the anger, but also explain how record inequality has corrupted our system, and pledge to limit the political power of big corporations and the super-rich. The basic bargain in America used to be that if you worked hard and played by the rules, you\u2019d do better, and your children would do even better than you. But since 1980, that bargain has become a sham. The middle class has shrunk. Why? While Republicans steadily cut taxes on the wealthy, Democrats abandoned the working class. Democrats embraced Nafta and lowered tariffs on Chinese goods. They deregulated finance and allowed Wall Street to become a high-stakes gambling casino. They let big corporations gain enough market power to keep prices (and profit margins) high. They let corporations bust unions (with negligible penalties) and slash payrolls. They bailed out Wall Street when its gambling addiction threatened to blow up the entire economy but never bailed out homeowners who lost everything. They welcomed big money into their campaigns, and delivered quid pro quos that rigged the market in favor of big corporations and the wealthy. Joe Biden redirected the Democratic party back toward its working-class roots, but many of the changes he catalyzed \u2013 more vigorous actions against monopolies, stronger enforcement of labor laws and major investments in manufacturing, infrastructure, semiconductors and non-fossil fuels \u2013 wouldn\u2019t be evident for years. In any event, he could not communicate effectively about them. The Republican party says it\u2019s on the side of working people, but its policies will hurt ordinary workers even more. Trump\u2019s tariffs will drive up prices. His expected retreat from vigorous anti-monopoly enforcement will allow giant corporations to drive up prices further. If Republicans gain control over the House as well as the Senate, as looks likely, they will extend Trump\u2019s 2017 tax law and add additional tax cuts. As in 2017, these lower taxes will benefit mainly the wealthy and enlarge the national debt, which will give Republicans an excuse to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid \u2013 their objective for decades. Democrats must no longer do the bidding of big corporations and the wealthy. They must instead focus on winning back the working class. They should demand paid family leave, Medicare for all, free public higher education, stronger unions, higher taxes on great wealth, and housing credits that will generate the biggest boom in residential home construction since the second world war. They should also demand that corporations share their profits with their workers. They should call for limits on CEO pay, eliminate all stock buybacks (as was the SEC rule before 1982) and reject corporate welfare (subsidies and tax credit to companies and industries unrelated to the common good). Democrats need to tell Americans why their pay has been lousy for decades and their jobs less secure: not because of immigrants, liberals, people of color, the \u201cdeep state\u201d, or any other Trump Republican bogeyman, but because of the power of large corporations and the rich to rig the market and siphon off most of the economy\u2019s gains. In doing this, Democrats should not retreat from their concerns about democracy. Democracy goes together with a fair economy. Only by reducing the power of big money in our politics can America grow the middle class, reward hard work and reaffirm the basic bargain at the heart of our system. If the Trump Republicans gain control of the House, they will have complete control of the federal government. That means they will own whatever happens to the economy and will be responsible for whatever happens to America. Notwithstanding all their anti-establishment populist rhetoric, they will become the establishment. The Democratic party should use this inflection point to shift ground \u2013 from being the party of well-off college graduates, big corporations, \u201cnever-Tumpers\u201d like Dick Cheney and vacuous \u201ccentrism\u201d \u2013 to an anti-establishment party ready to shake up the system on behalf of the vast majority of Americans.

She soon struck up a friendship with a man in one of her classes and began joining him and his friends at campus events. \u201cI was dating my childhood sweetheart from home, so I definitely wasn\u2019t looking for a relationship, but I was keen to meet new people,\u201d she says.</p> <p>One day, she was invited to her new friend\u2019s apartment, where she met his girlfriend, Adriana. \u201cShe was in her third year studying psychology and I thought she was a bit intimidating<strong> </strong>because she was a senior,\u201d says Kathlina. Adriana admits she was \u201cfrosty\u201d at first. \u201cKathlina was so pretty and smart; I felt a bit threatened,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a very secure person at the time.\u201d</p> <p>Kathlina and Adriana crossed paths at a few more college events, but Adriana says she continued to give Kathlina the cold shoulder. \u201cEventually I started feeling guilty, so I asked my boyfriend for her number so I could apologise,\u201d she says.

We talked for hours about everything from food to politics to Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d From then on, they began attending campus events together more regularly and meeting up for lunch when they could. \u201cShe took me to my first nightclub,\u201d says Kathlina. \u201cI thought it was the coolest thing ever.\u201d</p> <div class=\"element element-callout\" data-campaign-id=\"38167a85-c3be-4127-b1ca-b6c56d15c043\" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>  <p>At the end of the academic year, Adriana broke up with her boyfriend and Kathlina supported her. \u201cShe was there through the thick of it.

Now, with a lawsuit filed in Texas making its way slowly through the courts, Trump has yet another avenue to chip away at legal limits on churches\u2019 political activity. The complaint, filed against the IRS by National Religious Broadcasters, two Texas churches and the group Intercessors for America \u2013 whose mission includes a \u201ccall for godly government\u201d \u2013 seeks to find the Johnson amendment unconstitutional. It claims that churches are subject to \u201cunique and discriminatory status\u201d under the tax code and that the IRS \u201coperates in a manner that disfavors conservative organizations and conservative, religious organizations\u201d in enforcing the law. Named after its author Lyndon B Johnson, the Johnson amendment is inserted into section 501(c)(3) of the tax code to prevent certain nonprofits from \u201cparticipating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office\u201d. The law also notes that \u201ccontributions to political campaign funds\u201d would \u201cclearly violate\u201d the provision. Some churches already flaunt the law\u2019s requirement to refrain from endorsing political candidates \u2013 a trend that the Texas Tribune has documented. Repealing the Johnson amendment would allow churches to go further, including potentially donating to partisan causes. Because churches, unlike other nonprofit organizations, are not required to file 990 forms disclosing key financial information to the IRS, such an arrangement would allow for little public oversight. Representing National Religious Broadcasters on the complaint is Michael Farris, the former CEO of the powerful rightwing legal outfit Alliance Defending Freedom and a driving force behind the \u201cparental rights\u201d movement, which seeks to limit schools\u2019 ability to teach about race, gender and sexuality in the classroom.

Still, she underscored that even if a bill isn\u2019t signed into law \u2013 something she pointed out Trump has said he wouldn\u2019t do, though \u201cconsistency isn\u2019t the hallmark of the president-elect\u201d \u2013 there are ways to threaten abortion access at a national level.</p> <p>Northup and other colleagues at the Center held an open video meeting a few hours before we spoke, the tone of which was sober, with lots of \u201cno way to sugarcoat what we\u2019re facing right nows\u201ds, and \u201cserious situation\u201ds and \u201ctough road ahead\u201ds.</p> <p>Among her top concerns are, first, the fear that new laws will threaten patients\u2019 access to medication abortion \u2013 something she calls \u201ca lifeline\u201d, as <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/2024/03/medication-abortion-accounted-63-all-us-abortions-2023-increase-53-2020#:~:text=Medication%20Abortion%20Accounted%20for%2063,53%25%20in%202020%20%7C%20Guttmacher%20Institute\">two-thirds</a> of patients in the US use it \u2013 either by the FDA restricting mifepristone, or states using a 1873 chastity law known as the Comstock Act, which bans \u201cany drug, medicine, article, or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion\u201d from being transported by a mail carrier; and, second, the targeting of populations in states with bans. She recently found herself on the phone with a woman whose family was leaving Texas to get an abortion in New York, and wasn\u2019t sure if her husband should come with her or not.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a culture, or a climate, of fear of prosecution, and intimidation, and silencing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has a chilling effect.\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s a chilling effect that the <em>minority</em> of American voters want to cast over the country. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/exit-polls\">One exit poll</a> noted that while voters in 10 \u201ckey states\u201d believe by a wide margin that abortion should be legal, only 14% considered it their most important voting issue.</p> <p>I reached out to a friend who works in the reproductive rights space for help parsing through this disconnect.</p> <p>\u201cThe lack of urgency that voters placed on this issue may reflect an erroneous belief that state protections can save them; misplaced faith in Trump\u2019s softened messaging on abortion; or simply a reality that many are struggling to make ends meet and feel abortion is an issue they can\u2019t afford to think about today,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWho knows.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever the reason, it means the litigators at CRR have their work cut out for them, as they fight for what the majority of Americans want.</p> <p>Right now, Northup is revving up for a case that will start on Tuesday in Idaho, arguing that the state, by refusing to give stabilizing care to pregnant women in emergencies, is violating the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (Emtala), a federal law that ensures access to emergency care. And she is gaining strength from success stories, like Missouri, which overturned its near-total abortion ban on Tuesday, despite electing Trump, something she called \u201cstunning\u201d. (She remembers having a conversation with a senator in Missouri years ago, and bringing up the question of just how to talk about abortion rights in the state. The senator\u2019s advice: \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d)</p> <p>How does she feel?</p> <p>\u201cArmored up and ready to go.\u201d</p> <p>For those of us who might not feel that way, there are other ways to help. On the video call, one colleague offered three action items: First, take care of yourselves and your communities. Second: sign up for alerts from the Center. Finally, find and donate to a local abortion access fund.</p> <p>Godspeed.</p> <ul> <li><p>Sophie Brickman is a contributor to the New Yorker, the New York Times and other publications, and the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Unplugged-Mothers-Balance-Digital/dp/0062966480/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\">Baby, Unplugged: One Mother\u2019s Search for Balance, Reason, and Sanity in the Digital Age</a> and the novel <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/plays-well-with-others-sophie-brickman?variant=41223635697698\">Plays Well With Others</a></p></li> </ul>",

Among her top concerns are, first, the fear that new laws will threaten patients\u2019 access to medication abortion \u2013 something she calls \u201ca lifeline\u201d, as two-thirds of patients in the US use it \u2013 either by the FDA restricting mifepristone, or states using a 1873 chastity law known as the Comstock Act, which bans \u201cany drug, medicine, article, or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion\u201d from being transported by a mail carrier; and, second, the targeting of populations in states with bans. She recently found herself on the phone with a woman whose family was leaving Texas to get an abortion in New York, and wasn\u2019t sure if her husband should come with her or not. \u201cThat\u2019s a culture, or a climate, of fear of prosecution, and intimidation, and silencing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has a chilling effect.\u201d And it\u2019s a chilling effect that the minority of American voters want to cast over the country. One exit poll noted that while voters in 10 \u201ckey states\u201d believe by a wide margin that abortion should be legal, only 14% considered it their most important voting issue. I reached out to a friend who works in the reproductive rights space for help parsing through this disconnect. \u201cThe lack of urgency that voters placed on this issue may reflect an erroneous belief that state protections can save them; misplaced faith in Trump\u2019s softened messaging on abortion; or simply a reality that many are struggling to make ends meet and feel abortion is an issue they can\u2019t afford to think about today,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWho knows.\u201d Whatever the reason, it means the litigators at CRR have their work cut out for them, as they fight for what the majority of Americans want. Right now, Northup is revving up for a case that will start on Tuesday in Idaho, arguing that the state, by refusing to give stabilizing care to pregnant women in emergencies, is violating the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (Emtala), a federal law that ensures access to emergency care. And she is gaining strength from success stories, like Missouri, which overturned its near-total abortion ban on Tuesday, despite electing Trump, something she called \u201cstunning\u201d. (She remembers having a conversation with a senator in Missouri years ago, and bringing up the question of just how to talk about abortion rights in the state. The senator\u2019s advice: \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d) How does she feel? \u201cArmored up and ready to go.\u201d For those of us who might not feel that way, there are other ways to help. On the video call, one colleague offered three action items: First, take care of yourselves and your communities. Second: sign up for alerts from the Center. Finally, find and donate to a local abortion access fund. Godspeed.

      "body": "<p>Let me guess: you recently bought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/oct/29/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review\">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, strayed into the multiplayer mode and now you\u2019re being mercilessly pummelled by hundreds of teenagers with suggestive usernames? Don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s perfectly normal. Call of Duty has always been the arcade twitchfest of the online shooter scene, but Black Ops 6 has a whole new feel thanks to its omni-movement system, which lets you dive, roll and sprint in every direction. And the weapons have all been completely redesigned. It is, as Olivia Rodrigo put it, brutal out there.</p> <p>So I asked two excellent pro players \u2013 Ethan \u201cFifakill\u201d Pink and Liam \u201cJukeyz\u201d James \u2013 for their tips. Instead of laughing and pointing at me, they agreed.</p> <h2>Use the right gun</h2> <p>If you\u2019re just getting into CoD, stick with the assault rifles or submachine guns [SMGs] \u2013 they suit the smaller maps and intense engagement speed in Black Ops 6. \u201cMy favourite assault rifle [AR] is probably the Model L, although it\u2019s so good professionals have agreed not to use it \u2013 they\u2019ve moved to the AMES,\u201d says Jukeyz. \u201cThe SMG would be the Jackal which feels fun to use, or the KSV which is harder, but pretty over-powered\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile Fifakill recommends the Kompakt 92. \u201cIt has a super high fire rate and very good movement speed, you can absolutely destroy with it. But if you\u2019re more of a mid-range player, I\u2019d say the Model L assault rifle is a really good option. It will take a while to unlock, but it\u2019s worth the effort \u2013 super TTK [time to kill] and very low recoil.\u201d</p>    <h2>Become a Gunsmith tinkerer</h2> <p>Gunsmith is where you can add modifications to your weapon, and it\u2019s vital for giving you the edge in encounters. \u201cFor the majority of players, it\u2019s best to start by reducing recoil,\u201d says Fifakill. \u201cFocus on attachments that reduce <em>horizontal</em> recoil \u2013 if the gun is bouncing up or down it\u2019s pretty simple to correct. But with left and right, while you\u2019re trying to track an enemy player, that\u2019s more difficult.\u201d Jukeyz prioritises aim-down sight speed (how quickly you can get the gun into an aiming position), but also suggests attaching a vertical foregrip to counter recoil. \u201cI\u2019d also suggest the Gunfighter wildcard,\u201d adds Fifakill. \u201cIt gives you eight attachments per gun, so you can have it all: better movement, a bigger mag and less recoil.\u201d</p> <h2>Perk yourself up</h2> <p>Black Ops 6 allows you to choose from 20 perks which give you buffs in specific areas. They\u2019re split into three categories \u2013 Enforcer (red), Recon (blue) and Strategist (green) \u2013 and if you pick three from the same type you get a bonus speciality perk. \u201cI\u2019ve been running the red perks because that gives you a super speed bonus and you get extra health re-gen after you make a kill \u2013 it really benefits you if you\u2019re trying to run and gun,\u201d says Fifakill.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to push for kills run three red perks: I like Gung Ho, Assassin and Double Time. If you\u2019re a slower player I\u2019d go for blue perks and the speciality for that is useful. And if you\u2019re an objective player then run the three green perks.\u201d</p> <p>Jukeyz favours Dexterity, Assassin and then Double Time: \u201cAnd because they\u2019re all red, it gives you the Enforcer speciality, which means killing enemies gets you a temp buff to movement speed and health re-gen. It\u2019s perfect for ARs or SMGs.\u201d</p> <h2>Maximise your XP</h2> <p>Earning experience points [XP] unlocks new items and scorestreaks so levelling up fast is a good idea. \u201cUse BankRoll as perk three,\u201d suggests Jukeyz. \u201cOnce you\u2019re getting double or triple kills, you\u2019ll unlock UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), Counter UAV and HARP (High-Altitude Reconnaissance Plane) a lot quicker. If you have all three activated at once, you get so much Assist XP from teammates using them all over the map. It\u2019s constant XP.\u201d</p> <h2>Use a monitor and headphones</h2> <p>Stop playing on the giant OLED television in your living room: the response time will be slower than a dedicated monitor and it\u2019s hard to see everything on the screen while also checking your minimap and ammo count. Both our pros use a 27-inch monitor, with a 1440p resolution and at least 144Hz refresh rate. Also, switch from speakers to a headset. \u201cI use JBLs,\u201d says Fifakill. \u201cBut as long as you have a headset that has decent spatial audio you should be fine, and there are in-game settings you can tweak, for example, enabling Dolby Atmos which will help you to hear where footsteps are coming from.\u201d</p>    <h2>Be a team player</h2> <p>Call of Duty multiplayer is a team game, so you need to think tactically even when you\u2019re with a bunch of strangers. \u201cIf you really want to win an Objective mode (a multiplayer mode such as Control or Hardpoint which has a specific goal) on a public server, focus on spawn points,\u201d says Fifakill. \u201cIt\u2019s about going ahead to a new area where you know an objective is going to be and try to lock down the spawn point at that position for your team. It\u2019s not the most glamorous role, but it\u2019s useful. It means when the objective arrives, your team is going to be spawning close by, so you can get reinforcements a lot faster.\u201d</p> <p>Jukeyz recommends a more social approach. \u201cA bit of communication is a good start,\u201d he says. \u201cWho\u2019s watching what, who\u2019s taking the hard point. Get friends to play with you, or start chatting to people you meet in public servers who you think are good. Get a bit of structure with your gameplay \u2013 even shouting \u2018left\u2019 or \u2018right\u2019 (to indicate threats or where to run), is a start.\u201d</p> <h2>Use the minimap</h2> <p>Fifakill reckons he spends 70% of a match watching the minimap, which becomes a lot more viable once you\u2019ve learned the maps inside out. Watch for red markers which show the position of rival players and enemy fire; watch where your teammates are running, listen out for anything they \u2018ping\u2019 (mark on the map). Or as Jukeyz puts it: \u201cpay attention to <em>everything</em>\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/Fifakill\">Fifakill</a> and <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/jukeyz\">Jukeyz</a> are on Twitch and YouTube</p>",

But it does come with a reading list that includes Judith Butler, a UC Berkeley philosopher who has written influential work on feminism and gender, and Ibram X Kendi, an author and professor who runs the Center for Antiracist Research at Boston University. The reading list includes two of Doyle\u2019s own books: 2021\u2019s Free Speech and Why It Matters and 2022\u2019s The New Puritans. In The New Puritans, Doyle characterizes Butler as one of the authors of the \u201cfoundational sacred texts\u201d of \u201cthe woke religion\u201d, a movement which he claims has effected the \u201clegitimisation of bullying on a grand scale\u201d.

In that book \u2013 which is \u201cbuilt on a foundation of exaggerations and misrepresentations\u201d according to Vox \u2013 Rufo claimed that Kendi\u2019s proposals for antiracist government policies would bring about \u201can end to the constitutional order\u201d.

Doyle is a British writer, satirist and media personality who has become one of the UK\u2019s most prominent \u201canti-woke\u201d critics. He has claimed to be on the political left, and supported the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2017 election.

I was caught off guard by what came next. \u2018But you didn\u2019t apologize to her, at least according to folks that we\u2019ve talked to.\u2019 I fought to contain my frustration as I replied that while I\u2019d never talked to her directly, I did say publicly on more than [one] occasion I was sorry.\u201d Clinton admits in Citizen that the interview \u201cwas not my finest hour\u201d, adding that he was prepared to be asked why he had not apologized to Lewinsky in person but not to be accused of not apologizing at all. He also takes a swipe at Melvin, who was \u201cbarely in his teens when all this happened, and probably hadn\u2019t been properly briefed\u201d. The Democrat reflects: \u201cRegardless, it\u2019s always better to save your anger for what happens to other people, not yourself.\u201d He notes that NBC soon added a clip of him speaking to faith leaders at the White House in 1999 and apologizing to his family, Lewinsky and her family and the American people. \u201cI meant it then and I mean it today,\u201d he writes. \u201cI live with it all the time. Monica\u2019s done a lot of good and important work over the last few years in her campaign against bullying, earning her well-deserved recognition in the United States and abroad. I wish her nothing but the best.\u201d Lewinsky is now an anti-bullying activist, public speaker and writer. In 2021 the Today show asked her whether she feels that Clinton owes her an apology. She said: \u201cI don\u2019t need it. He should wanna apologize, in the same way that I wanna apologize any chance I get to people that I\u2019ve hurt and my actions have hurt.\u201d Clinton\u2019s wife, Hillary, was beaten by Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. The fallout of the #MeToo movement did not prevent him addressing this year\u2019s Democratic national convention or campaigning for Vice-president Kamala Harris in the race for the White House.",

In the past year, Brazil\u2019s southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul has faced one of the worst environmental catastrophes in Brazil\u2019s recent history. A series of unprecedented floods affected more than 2 million people in 95% of its municipalities and displaced more than 420,000, according to the UN\u2019s refugee agency, UNHCR. In the worst incident last May, 183 people died, 27 are still missing and 806 were injured. Many residents lost their houses entirely as streets turned into rivers. Six months later, nearly 1,800 people are still unable to return home, and are living in 40 shelters in 23 different cities, the UNHCR says. The floods may have cost the Brazilian economy 97bn reais (\u00a313bn), with damages of R$58bn just in Rio Grande do Sul. As the effects of the climate crisis are increasingly felt in South America, state authorities are urgently seeking to adapt and mitigate the risks of floods and extreme weather events in a region where the number of days of extreme rainfall has more than doubled since the 1960s. Southern Brazil \u2013 like the rest of the country \u2013 is an outstanding model of adopting clean energy. According to the energy ministry\u2019s report last year on the National Energy Balance, more than 80% of Brazil\u2019s electricity already comes from renewables: 58.6% is provided by hydroelectric plants, wind power has grown to 17.6% and now provides as much energy as fossil fuels , while 5.7% of energy comes from solar. However, Rio Grande do Sul is one of the three states in Brazil that still rely on coal for energy, and the state government sees the floods as an opportunity to expand green initiatives to boost a struggling economy \u2013 it is estimated to decline by almost 10% in 2024, decreasing Brazil\u2019s GDP by 1%.

Key targets of the plan include reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 and ensuring sustainable development for local communities. According to officials, the state assembly could vote on the energy transition plan within a year.

It\u2019s not yet October, but for reasons I don\u2019t quite understand the home is throwing a Thanksgiving dinner for residents and guests.

I was there to research a book I was writing about the history of the women\u2019s movement, but also about my mother, whose life story echoes the rise and fall of second-wave feminism. In 1974, a year after Roe v Wade passed, my 22-year-old mother travelled from Essex, England to New York City and took a Greyhound bus across the country to visit June, who was then living in Omaha, Nebraska. At that time, my mum\u2019s life, as it was for so many women of the era, was full of promise. She was the first in the family to go to university, coming of age alongside the revolutionary ideas of the 1960s. I wanted to learn from June who my mum was when everything still seemed possible. I was on this journey as a journalist and as a daughter; in each of these roles, I wanted to know everything.</p> <p>June is my grandfather\u2019s sister. It was on my trip, a recreation of the same one my mother made in 1974, complete with a Greyhound bus ride across the midwest, that, at the age of 35, I finally saw his face. He was a violent bully of a man who died some years ago, whom my mother had never allowed me to meet, not that I had any desire to. Cousins have shown me pictures of him and my grandmother where his face is always scribbled out. But on the wall of June\u2019s apartment, there he was. </p> <p>I knew the story of my grandfather well. Or so I thought, until over slices of turkey, one of June\u2019s children, Terry, who had joined us for the Thanksgiving lunch, asked me how Paul* is. \u201cWho\u2019s Paul?\u201d I asked. Terry looked at June. June looked at me. I knew my grandfather left my grandmother, but I didn\u2019t know, until that moment, that he had a second family and my mum had a half-brother, Paul, living in England. June was keen for me to connect with him. I texted my mum. \u201cI probably just forgot to mention it,\u201d she replied.</p> <p>I\u2019d travelled a long way in search of a greater understanding of my mother and here was a compelling lead \u2013 a whole new family, who, judging from what I could decipher from Terry and June, had a very different relationship with my grandfather.</p> <p>A few weeks after returning to the UK I received a Facebook friend request. I\u2019d hit the journalist\u2019s jackpot \u2013 Paul wanted to connect. I was itching to unearth the story of my mother from a new perspective, one I didn\u2019t know existed. New branches of a family tree were appearing in real time, pointing like arrows I should be following.</p> <p>Everything is copy, Nora Ephron said, and the writer in me felt this throb in my fingers.

What right did I have to expose a wound kept out of the daylight for decades?</p> <p>And so I didn\u2019t follow my lead. The Facebook friend request remains unaccepted, and that arm of my investigation came to a close. The daughter in me won out \u2013 I realised it was no longer my story to follow.

Even Alex Cooper\u2019s Call Her Daddy \u2013 the second-most listened-to pod on the planet \u2013 has the air of an exclusive club. Occasionally, however, Cooper performs feats of headline-grabbing cut-through. In the past few months, the show \u2013 which is beloved for its sex-positive take on womanhood \u2013 has made the news with interviews with Katy Perry (on her disastrous comeback) and Kamala Harris (on her family life and her campaign); episodes that become required listening for anyone attempting to stay on top of the zeitgeist.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/nymphet-alumni/id1557564982\">Nymphet Alumni</a></strong><strong><br></strong>If you\u2019ve ever found yourself stumped by endlessly rebooting TikTok aesthetics or baffled by the latest (as in, 10 minutes ago) trends, Nymphet Alumni is here to help. Hosting trio Biz Sherbert, Sam Cummins and Alexi Alario tackle bleeding-edge fashion and extremely online phenomena \u2013 from \u201cmogging\u201d to Mormon style \u2013 in a manner that is unabashedly literate but never inaccessible. Sometimes, they even name trends themselves (see: blokette, in which football shirts and Sambas meet girly-girl attire), as well as looking back on the 20th-century fashion roots of various revivals.

At this point, Ed Gamble and James Acaster are consummate professionals when it comes to extracting dream-meal-based banter from their interviewees, but the episodes of Off Menu really worth hearing involve guests with staunchly eccentric tastes and the resulting hysterical spiral of callbacks. Highlights include Victoria Coren-Mitchell\u2019s dinner party sandwiches, Ivo Graham and his Yeo Valley yoghurt, Nicola Coughlan\u2019s Robbie Williams wrap and the peerless madness of The Inbetweeners star Joe Thomas, \u201cSoft Touch\u201d and the buried lamb.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/desert-island-discs/id342735925\">Desert Island Discs</a></strong><strong><br></strong>Very few podcasts have decades-long archives to dive back into, let alone one that goes back to the 1940s. But that\u2019s what you get when you convert the UK\u2019s longest-running radio show into a podcast. There are now 2,482 episodes of Desert Island Discs \u2013 whose taste-based premise has proven an influential template for the contemporary podcast (see the aforementioned Off Menu and many more) \u2013 available to dip into. The back catalogue alone is a fascinating cultural chronicle, featuring hugely famous guests, along with many, many others who have faded into obscurity.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/good-one-a-podcast-about-jokes/id1203393721\">Good One</a></strong> <br>That old adage about analysis destroying comedy has been comprehensively debunked by a critical establishment now far more inclined to take standup seriously. And Good Ones, \u201ca podcast about jokes\u201d from Vulture\u2019s Jesse David Fox, takes comedy very seriously indeed. With guests including John Early, Alex Edelman, Jack Whitehall and Joel Kim Booster, Fox goes extremely deep into the craft and context behind routines and sketches: we\u2019re talking two-hour-plus postmortems on standup shows. It\u2019s a bit too intense for a binge listen \u2013 in moderation, however, it\u2019s a thrilling and insightful peek behind the curtain.</p> <h2><strong>Why not try \u2026</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0018x4q/broadcasts/upcoming\">Best Medicine with Kiri Pritchard-McLean</a> returns for a second series, with comedians, doctors, scientists and historians celebrating marvellous medical breakthroughs.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-good-sex-project/id1687235733\">The Good Sex Project</a>, in which Melody Thomas goes on a quest to understand how to do it right.</p></li> <li><p>Journalist and documentary-maker Lucy Sherriff\u2019s investigation into the sudden disappearance of a wealthy widow, <a href=\"https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/wheres-dia\">Where\u2019s Dia?</a></p></li> </ul> <p><em>If you want to read the complete version of the newsletter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/10/hear-here-podcast-recommendations-sign-up-for-unexpected-audio-pleasures\">please subscribe</a> to receive Hear Here in your inbox every Thursday</em></p>",

Dip in to feel like you understand the modern world, even if it\u2019s just for an hour. Off Menu Some podcasts are successful regardless \u2013 or sometimes even in spite of \u2013 their guests, while others depend more on the energy of the celebrity involved. At this point, Ed Gamble and James Acaster are consummate professionals when it comes to extracting dream-meal-based banter from their interviewees, but the episodes of Off Menu really worth hearing involve guests with staunchly eccentric tastes and the resulting hysterical spiral of callbacks. Highlights include Victoria Coren-Mitchell\u2019s dinner party sandwiches, Ivo Graham and his Yeo Valley yoghurt, Nicola Coughlan\u2019s Robbie Williams wrap and the peerless madness of The Inbetweeners star Joe Thomas, \u201cSoft Touch\u201d and the buried lamb. Desert Island Discs Very few podcasts have decades-long archives to dive back into, let alone one that goes back to the 1940s. But that\u2019s what you get when you convert the UK\u2019s longest-running radio show into a podcast. There are now 2,482 episodes of Desert Island Discs \u2013 whose taste-based premise has proven an influential template for the contemporary podcast (see the aforementioned Off Menu and many more) \u2013 available to dip into. The back catalogue alone is a fascinating cultural chronicle, featuring hugely famous guests, along with many, many others who have faded into obscurity. Good One That old adage about analysis destroying comedy has been comprehensively debunked by a critical establishment now far more inclined to take standup seriously. And Good Ones, \u201ca podcast about jokes\u201d from Vulture\u2019s Jesse David Fox, takes comedy very seriously indeed. With guests including John Early, Alex Edelman, Jack Whitehall and Joel Kim Booster, Fox goes extremely deep into the craft and context behind routines and sketches: we\u2019re talking two-hour-plus postmortems on standup shows. It\u2019s a bit too intense for a binge listen \u2013 in moderation, however, it\u2019s a thrilling and insightful peek behind the curtain. Why not try \u2026 Best Medicine with Kiri Pritchard-McLean returns for a second series, with comedians, doctors, scientists and historians celebrating marvellous medical breakthroughs. The Good Sex Project, in which Melody Thomas goes on a quest to understand how to do it right.

As for where you go from there \u2013 here are some suggestions \u2026</p> <h2><strong>Breakfast</strong></h2> <p>While a boiled egg with toast soldiers remains an iconic way to start the day, there are myriad ways to make eggs the star of your morning meal. As well as being central to a host of breakfast dishes, from the classic Full English to more elaborate servings such eggs benedict and kedgeree, it\u2019s also worth taking a dash of inspiration from repasts elsewhere.</p>    <p>Migas is popular in Spain, Portugal and Mexico. If you\u2019re going for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/oct/16/why-you-need-migas-recipe-in-your-life-to-use-stale-bread-loaf-zero-waste-cooking-recipe\">Iberian version</a>, it\u2019s essentially a pile of crispy fried breadcrumbs topped with fried eggs and just about anything else hearty to hand, such as chorizo. Or, if you\u2019re <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/dec/30/turn-leftover-tortillas-nachos-into-mexican-style-brunch-recipe-zero-waste-cooking\">in the mood for Mexican</a>, think tortilla chips loaded with scrambled eggs, pico de gallo and melted cheese. A Spanish omelette made with onions, thinly sliced potatoes and plenty of good, grassy extra-virgin olive oil is a great get-ahead, grab-and-go breakfast. Or, if you prefer a sweeter start, you can use your eggs to make fluffy American-style pancakes or cinnamon-dusted french toast.</p> <h2><strong>Lunch</strong></h2> <p>Whether you work from home or pack your lunch, eggs can happily feature in your midday meal, too. Their protein-packed punch (a medium-sized egg contains about 6.4g) will help keep you going through the inevitable post-lunch slump.</p> <p>Egg mayo sandwiches, homemade scotch eggs and wraps filled with scrambled eggs or tortilla are lunchbox staples that are quick and easy to make in advance. But why stick to the basics? Try some head-turning lunches that you might not have considered before, such as hearty slices of quiche, a slice of sausage and egg pie encased in gleaming, egg-glazed pastry, or a Japanese egg sando, featuring milk bread, crusts removed, stuffed with both egg mayonnaise and halved hard-boiled eggs. Now that\u2019s what we call a filling!</p> <h2><strong>Dinner</strong></h2> <p>Of course, eggs can also form the basis of a hearty dinner \u2013 and while they\u2019ve got many specialised uses for your evening meal, I\u2019m growing increasingly fond of having <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/collections/breakfast_for_dinner\" rel=\"nofollow\">breakfast dishes for dinner</a> (although calling it \u201cbrinner\u201d might be a step too far). Breakfast is one of the best meals of the day, so enjoying it twice makes sense; especially as we tend to have a bit more time in the evening to enjoy it at our leisure.</p> <p>You can make more of a meal of your favourite breakfast fare by adding a few flashy extras: elevate scrambled eggs by dolloping them on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/sep/07/how-to-make-the-perfect-sweetcorn-fritters-recipe\">sweetcorn fritters</a> served with sliced avocado and a dash of hot sauce and sour cream, add merguez sausages to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/28/josh-katz-recipe-shakshuka-tomato-pepper-stew-eggs-breakfast\">shakshuka</a>, or make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/01/how-to-make-french-toast-recipe-felicity-cloake\">french toast</a> bacon sandwiches (with a drizzle of syrup if you dare).</p> <p>Those who prefer to keep breakfast and dinner on nodding terms only are also spoilt for choice. A crispy fried egg with an oozy yolk is a deliciously luxurious flourish atop a bowl of stir-fried noodles, while a frittata \u2013 the omelette\u2019s Italian cousin \u2013 is a dinnertime triple threat: speedy, healthy and a great way of using up pretty much any odd or end you can forage from the back of the fridge. And don\u2019t forget <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jun/14/rachel-roddy-carbonara-recipe-kitchen-rome\">a silky carbonara</a>; made with golden egg yolks \u2013 let\u2019s be real here, Freshlay Farms\u2019 Golden Yolkers are going to be perfect for this \u2013 crispy guanciale and a snowfall of salty pecorino. Serve it up with a whisky or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/10/classic-pisco-sour-cocktail-recipe-martin-morales-ceviche\">pisco sour</a> and your egg whites won\u2019t go to waste, either.</p>    <h2><strong>Dessert</strong></h2> <p>Finally, we need to take a moment to celebrate the way eggs are the unsung heroes of all your favourite desserts. Whether your go-to sweet treat is a slice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2017/feb/02/how-to-cook-the-perfect-sticky-orange-cake\">orange polenta cake</a>, a rich, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/nov/22/simon-hopkinson-sherry-trifle-recipe\">custard-laden trifle</a>, a gently wobbling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/mar/18/rachel-roddy-recipe-for-creme-caramel\">creme caramel</a> or a crisp and even<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/aug/21/how-to-cook-the-perfect-pavlova-recipe\"> pavlova</a> \u2013 the humble egg is the secret ingredient binding the rest together.</p> <p>In short, when you bring eggs to the table beyond breakfast, you\u2019ll discover, to paraphrase Patricia Hayes, that happiness really is egg-shaped.</p> <p><em>Find out more about <a href=\"https://freshlayeggs.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Freshlay Farms</a> and why its Golden Yolkers have clinched a Great Taste Award 2024</em></p>",

Or, if you prefer a sweeter start, you can use your eggs to make fluffy American-style pancakes or cinnamon-dusted french toast. Lunch Whether you work from home or pack your lunch, eggs can happily feature in your midday meal, too. Their protein-packed punch (a medium-sized egg contains about 6.4g) will help keep you going through the inevitable post-lunch slump. Egg mayo sandwiches, homemade scotch eggs and wraps filled with scrambled eggs or tortilla are lunchbox staples that are quick and easy to make in advance. But why stick to the basics? Try some head-turning lunches that you might not have considered before, such as hearty slices of quiche, a slice of sausage and egg pie encased in gleaming, egg-glazed pastry, or a Japanese egg sando, featuring milk bread, crusts removed, stuffed with both egg mayonnaise and halved hard-boiled eggs. Now that\u2019s what we call a filling! Dinner Of course, eggs can also form the basis of a hearty dinner \u2013 and while they\u2019ve got many specialised uses for your evening meal, I\u2019m growing increasingly fond of having breakfast dishes for dinner (although calling it \u201cbrinner\u201d might be a step too far). Breakfast is one of the best meals of the day, so enjoying it twice makes sense; especially as we tend to have a bit more time in the evening to enjoy it at our leisure. You can make more of a meal of your favourite breakfast fare by adding a few flashy extras: elevate scrambled eggs by dolloping them on sweetcorn fritters served with sliced avocado and a dash of hot sauce and sour cream, add merguez sausages to a shakshuka, or make french toast bacon sandwiches (with a drizzle of syrup if you dare). Those who prefer to keep breakfast and dinner on nodding terms only are also spoilt for choice. A crispy fried egg with an oozy yolk is a deliciously luxurious flourish atop a bowl of stir-fried noodles, while a frittata \u2013 the omelette\u2019s Italian cousin \u2013 is a dinnertime triple threat: speedy, healthy and a great way of using up pretty much any odd or end you can forage from the back of the fridge. And don\u2019t forget a silky carbonara; made with golden egg yolks \u2013 let\u2019s be real here, Freshlay Farms\u2019 Golden Yolkers are going to be perfect for this \u2013 crispy guanciale and a snowfall of salty pecorino. Serve it up with a whisky or pisco sour and your egg whites won\u2019t go to waste, either. Dessert Finally, we need to take a moment to celebrate the way eggs are the unsung heroes of all your favourite desserts. Whether your go-to sweet treat is a slice orange polenta cake, a rich, custard-laden trifle, a gently wobbling creme caramel or a crisp and even pavlova \u2013 the humble egg is the secret ingredient binding the rest together. In short, when you bring eggs to the table beyond breakfast, you\u2019ll discover, to paraphrase Patricia Hayes, that happiness really is egg-shaped.

But record execs refused to see past his dark skin and overweight physique. The stigma had Vandross at once determined to succeed and self-conscious about stepping into the spotlight.</p> <p>A native New Yorker, Vandross convinced his friends to form a group \u2013 but relegated himself to a background role. Still, there was no missing him when the group appeared on the first season of Sesame Street, where Vandross helped set the groovy template for children\u2019s songs. Despite continual rejection from record labels, Vandross dropped out of college to pursue his music dream. On a lark, he wound up in the studio session for Young Americans and was vibing to the project so hard that David Bowie hired him to sing backup and arrange the vocals.</p> <p>Vandross\u2019s work on the refrain for the titular song alone should have had industry bigwigs reconsidering him as a leading man. Instead, it typecast him as a premier background singer and led to more lucrative work in advertising. His first jingle, for Gino\u2019s Pizza, is where Vandross conceived of a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vNPmfXudDwM?si=XT1OZ7H7JK3kUwVa&amp;t=127\">ghostly vibrato</a> that had the control room erupting with excitement. \u201cThis is gonna end up being his thing,\u201d Deborah McDuffie, the producer on the commercial, recalls in the doc. \u201cWe were thinking [about] it in the control room, but he was thinking [about] it on mic. \u2018Oh I\u2019m not doing this in any more jingles\u2019 \u2013 and he never did.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2DzYSv9a-k\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W2DzYSv9a-k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Record execs weren\u2019t just hung up on Vandross\u2019s looks. To their ear, his sound was out of tune with R&amp;B; at the time he was attempting to go solo in the late 70s, the genre was dominated by Gamble and Huff \u2013 the Philadelphia music factory behind the O\u2019Jays, Lou Rawls and other unapologetically macho acts. It took Roberta Flack firing Vandross from her tour out of a desire to see him fulfill his destiny as a solo artist for him to finally go his own way.</p> <p>He invested a chunk of his earnings and called in favors from Whitney\u2019s mother, Cissy Houston, the Grammy-winning composer Marcus Miller and other super-talented friends to cut the demo for Never Too Much \u2013 the buttery groove that effectively changed the tone of R&amp;B music going forward. In the doc, Miller, who plays bass on the record, remembers reading the sheet music for the first time and thinking, \u201cthis is a quirky little bassline\u201d. It made the song recognizable from the first note.</p> <p>But even as the hits kept coming, Vandross was pigeonholed as R&amp;B \u2013 or \u201cAfrican-American\u201d, as Clive Davis says flatly in the doc. The coded language, explains the acclaimed music journalist Danyel Smith, was typical of an industry that saw music as a racially bespoke commodity and packaged it that way. Epic Records, Vandross\u2019s label, marketed him exclusively to Black audiences; it hardly mattered that suburban white women were crazy about him, too.</p>    <p>Vandross maintained his dreamboat status through wild fluctuations in weight, a public struggle that became comic fodder everywhere from Eddie Murphy Delirious to Spike Lee\u2019s Kings of Comedy. When people weren\u2019t snickering over Vandross\u2019s weight, they were speculating about whether he was gay \u2013 a lifestyle that would have clashed with his carefully crafted romantic persona.</p> <p>Porter does an admirable job of wrestling with this in the doc; she fits footage of Vandross and defenders arguing for his right to privacy around a bombshell clip of Patti LaBelle \u2013 a famous Vandross friendship that started with him launching her official fan club in high school \u2013 outing Vandross 12 years after his death. \u201cI loved, loved, loved that song Any Love before I worked for Luther,\u201d says Max Szadek, Vandross\u2019s personal assistant. \u201cBut once I started working for Luther, I could see that the desperation described in that song was real. And I hated that song after that because it always reminded me that he wasn\u2019t seeking love. He was seeking <em>any</em><strong> </strong>love.\u201d</p> <p>Vandross sought it most openly from the music industry. He was nominated for a Grammy nine times before winning one for Here and Now in 1991. When rap music stormed the pop charts at the turn of the century and a new generation of Black male R&amp;B singers adopted tougher guises in response, it seemed as if Vandross\u2019s lifelong dream of winning a Grammy and topping the US pop charts would never happen. Then in 2003, after leaving Epic for Davis\u2019s J Records, Vandross scored his first official mainstream hit with Dance with My Father \u2013 but there was no wallowing in the success. Not long after the song\u2019s release, Vandross suffered a stroke that scorched his singing voice and briefly confined him to a wheelchair. Two years later, in 2005, he died at age 54.</p> <p>Decades on, Vandross endures as a timeless crooner whose vulnerability and sincerity set the standard for male R&amp;B vocalists, practically an endangered species now. In the documentary, Vandross gets due credit for his role in breaking the color barrier in the music industry \u2013 where, ultimately, he made truer classifications for himself: adult contemporary, quiet storm. As much as it hurts to see Vandross cross over so late, the film softens the blow by proving why the public affection for him has only compounded since. \u201cIf we were able to talk to Luther at the time as fans,\u201d says Foxx, reconsidering the Vandross punchlines, \u201cwe would\u2019ve said, \u2018Whatever weight you are. We don\u2019t care. We just love you.\u2019\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Luther: Never Too Much is out now in select US cinemas and will be available on Max in 2025 with a UK date to be announced</p></li> </ul>",

A native New Yorker, Vandross convinced his friends to form a group \u2013 but relegated himself to a background role. Still, there was no missing him when the group appeared on the first season of Sesame Street, where Vandross helped set the groovy template for children\u2019s songs. Despite continual rejection from record labels, Vandross dropped out of college to pursue his music dream. On a lark, he wound up in the studio session for Young Americans and was vibing to the project so hard that David Bowie hired him to sing backup and arrange the vocals. Vandross\u2019s work on the refrain for the titular song alone should have had industry bigwigs reconsidering him as a leading man. Instead, it typecast him as a premier background singer and led to more lucrative work in advertising. His first jingle, for Gino\u2019s Pizza, is where Vandross conceived of a ghostly vibrato that had the control room erupting with excitement. \u201cThis is gonna end up being his thing,\u201d Deborah McDuffie, the producer on the commercial, recalls in the doc. \u201cWe were thinking [about] it in the control room, but he was thinking [about] it on mic. \u2018Oh I\u2019m not doing this in any more jingles\u2019 \u2013 and he never did.\u201d Record execs weren\u2019t just hung up on Vandross\u2019s looks. To their ear, his sound was out of tune with R&amp;B; at the time he was attempting to go solo in the late 70s, the genre was dominated by Gamble and Huff \u2013 the Philadelphia music factory behind the O\u2019Jays, Lou Rawls and other unapologetically macho acts. It took Roberta Flack firing Vandross from her tour out of a desire to see him fulfill his destiny as a solo artist for him to finally go his own way. He invested a chunk of his earnings and called in favors from Whitney\u2019s mother, Cissy Houston, the Grammy-winning composer Marcus Miller and other super-talented friends to cut the demo for Never Too Much \u2013 the buttery groove that effectively changed the tone of R&amp;B music going forward. In the doc, Miller, who plays bass on the record, remembers reading the sheet music for the first time and thinking, \u201cthis is a quirky little bassline\u201d. It made the song recognizable from the first note. But even as the hits kept coming, Vandross was pigeonholed as R&amp;B \u2013 or \u201cAfrican-American\u201d, as Clive Davis says flatly in the doc. The coded language, explains the acclaimed music journalist Danyel Smith, was typical of an industry that saw music as a racially bespoke commodity and packaged it that way. Epic Records, Vandross\u2019s label, marketed him exclusively to Black audiences; it hardly mattered that suburban white women were crazy about him, too. Vandross maintained his dreamboat status through wild fluctuations in weight, a public struggle that became comic fodder everywhere from Eddie Murphy Delirious to Spike Lee\u2019s Kings of Comedy. When people weren\u2019t snickering over Vandross\u2019s weight, they were speculating about whether he was gay \u2013 a lifestyle that would have clashed with his carefully crafted romantic persona. Porter does an admirable job of wrestling with this in the doc; she fits footage of Vandross and defenders arguing for his right to privacy around a bombshell clip of Patti LaBelle \u2013 a famous Vandross friendship that started with him launching her official fan club in high school \u2013 outing Vandross 12 years after his death. \u201cI loved, loved, loved that song Any Love before I worked for Luther,\u201d says Max Szadek, Vandross\u2019s personal assistant. \u201cBut once I started working for Luther, I could see that the desperation described in that song was real. And I hated that song after that because it always reminded me that he wasn\u2019t seeking love. He was seeking any love.\u201d Vandross sought it most openly from the music industry. He was nominated for a Grammy nine times before winning one for Here and Now in 1991. When rap music stormed the pop charts at the turn of the century and a new generation of Black male R&amp;B singers adopted tougher guises in response, it seemed as if Vandross\u2019s lifelong dream of winning a Grammy and topping the US pop charts would never happen. Then in 2003, after leaving Epic for Davis\u2019s J Records, Vandross scored his first official mainstream hit with Dance with My Father \u2013 but there was no wallowing in the success. Not long after the song\u2019s release, Vandross suffered a stroke that scorched his singing voice and briefly confined him to a wheelchair. Two years later, in 2005, he died at age 54. Decades on, Vandross endures as a timeless crooner whose vulnerability and sincerity set the standard for male R&amp;B vocalists, practically an endangered species now. In the documentary, Vandross gets due credit for his role in breaking the color barrier in the music industry \u2013 where, ultimately, he made truer classifications for himself: adult contemporary, quiet storm. As much as it hurts to see Vandross cross over so late, the film softens the blow by proving why the public affection for him has only compounded since. \u201cIf we were able to talk to Luther at the time as fans,\u201d says Foxx, reconsidering the Vandross punchlines, \u201cwe would\u2019ve said, \u2018Whatever weight you are. We don\u2019t care. We just love you.\u2019\u201d Luther: Never Too Much is out now in select US cinemas and will be available on Max in 2025 with a UK date to be announced",

      "body": "<p>Any chance of a second opinion? Afraid not: it\u2019s terminal. At 2pm on Thursday 14 November, BBC medical soap Doctors airs its last ever episode.</p> <p>After 24 years of aches, pains and plot twists, Mill Health Centre in the invented West Midlands town of Letherbridge will close its surgery doors for the last time. At least fans \u2013 it averages 1.6 million viewers a day \u2013 can console themselves with Doctors: A Celebration, which airs directly afterwards.</p>    <p>To mark its demise, we\u2019ve selected the best TV soap operas we\u2019ve loved and lost. Our ground rules for inclusion are that there were two or more episodes a week (hence Holby City and Howards\u2019 Way don\u2019t qualify) and had a domestic setting (ruling out The Bill and other workplace procedurals).</p> <p>From daytime fillers to primetime flops, here is our rundown of dearly departed soaps, ranked from worst to best \u2026</p> <h2><strong>20. </strong><strong>Eldorado (1992-1993)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfaXcZFcKn4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LfaXcZFcKn4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>One of the most mocked flops in BBC history. In an attempt to repeat the success of EastEnders, the BBC launched another soap starting with E, this one set in an expat community on the Costa del Sol (its working title was Little England). Cue a \u00a310m shambles. Scenes in Spanish baffled viewers. Acting was wooden. Location shooting in villas made dialogue echoey and inaudible. Don\u2019t even get us started on middle-aged Bunny and his 17-year-old bride Fizz. BBC One boss Alan Yentob axed it within two weeks of taking over.</p> <h2><strong>19. </strong><strong>The Young Doctors</strong><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>(1976-1983)</strong></h2> <p>At my signal, unleash aspirin! Russell Crowe made his acting debut in this medical saga about the lives and loves of staff at Sydney\u2019s Albert memorial hospital. It became an ITV afternoon staple, meaning a generation watched it while sick and off school. It was ultimately canned to make room for cricket in the Channel Nine schedules. The Young Doctors<strong> </strong>holds the unwelcome distinction, rare among long-running Aussie shows, of never winning a single award. Testament to its quality.</p> <h2><strong>18. </strong><strong>Sunset Beach (1997-1999)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DI4AswnrAxA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DI4AswnrAxA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Masterminded by soap supremo Aaron Spelling, this California melodrama was shallow, shiny and shameless. Sunset Beach peddled outrageous plotlines (hot tub fights! Evil twins! Secret turkey-baster impregnation!) and featured knowing celebrity cameos from the likes of Jerry Springer. When it won a cult following on Channel 5, it became the only US daytime soap to become a hit in the UK.</p> <h2><strong>17. </strong><strong>Triangle</strong><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>(1981-1983)</strong></h2> <p>What could be more glamorous than a soap set on a North Sea ferry? Sailing from Felixstowe to Gothenburg, Amsterdam and back, it was supposed to be a British take on The Love Boat. Unfortunately, grey skies made it look depressingly gloomy and the crew all got seasick. Larry Lamb was the hunky chief engineer; Kate O\u2019Mara the resident minx \u2013 memorably sunbathing topless on what was clearly a freezing cold deck. Terry Wogan had a hoot mocking it on his Radio 2 breakfast show. Anchors away.</p> <h2><strong>16. </strong><strong>Take the High Road (1980-2003)</strong></h2>    <p>The late queen mother was a fan of this kilt-clad soap about the fictional village of Glendarroch. It was set around a picturesque estate on the bonnie banks of Loch Lomond, with lairds, livestock, purple heather and a fiddly, folky theme tune. Most ITV regions dropped it in the mid-90s when its title was shortened to High Road but it retained a loyal fanbase in Scotland and Northern Ireland until it took the low road to the TV afterlife.</p> <h2><strong>15. </strong><strong>Angels (1975-1983)</strong></h2> <p>Part of a long line of medical soaps \u2013 Dr Finlay\u2019s Casebook, A Country Practice, Emergency Ward 10 and General Hospital almost made our cut \u2013 this female-led mould-breaker was dubbed \u201cthe Z-Cars of nursing\u201d and followed student nurses at the fictional Saint Angela\u2019s in Battersea, later relocating to Birmingham\u2019s Heath Green hospital. Its gritty authenticity was thanks to the cast working on real NHS wards to get hands-on experience. Producer Julia Smith and script editor Tony Holland later reunited to create EastEnders.</p> <h2><strong>14. </strong><strong>Sons </strong><strong>and Daughters (1982-1987)</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s hard to believe now but, at its peak, this Dallas-inspired spin on Romeo and Juliet notched up six million viewers on daytime ITV.

The starry cast included Mia Farrow, Gena Rowlands, Leslie Nielsen and Ryan O\u2019Neal. Producer Paul Monash refused to admit it was a soap, calling it a \u201chigh-class anthology drama\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Any chance of a second opinion? Afraid not: it\u2019s terminal. At 2pm on Thursday 14 November, BBC medical soap Doctors airs its last ever episode. After 24 years of aches, pains and plot twists, Mill Health Centre in the invented West Midlands town of Letherbridge will close its surgery doors for the last time. At least fans \u2013 it averages 1.6 million viewers a day \u2013 can console themselves with Doctors: A Celebration, which airs directly afterwards. To mark its demise, we\u2019ve selected the best TV soap operas we\u2019ve loved and lost. Our ground rules for inclusion are that there were two or more episodes a week (hence Holby City and Howards\u2019 Way don\u2019t qualify) and had a domestic setting (ruling out The Bill and other workplace procedurals). From daytime fillers to primetime flops, here is our rundown of dearly departed soaps, ranked from worst to best \u2026 20. Eldorado (1992-1993) One of the most mocked flops in BBC history. In an attempt to repeat the success of EastEnders, the BBC launched another soap starting with E, this one set in an expat community on the Costa del Sol (its working title was Little England). Cue a \u00a310m shambles. Scenes in Spanish baffled viewers. Acting was wooden. Location shooting in villas made dialogue echoey and inaudible. Don\u2019t even get us started on middle-aged Bunny and his 17-year-old bride Fizz. BBC One boss Alan Yentob axed it within two weeks of taking over. 19. The Young Doctors (1976-1983) At my signal, unleash aspirin! Russell Crowe made his acting debut in this medical saga about the lives and loves of staff at Sydney\u2019s Albert memorial hospital. It became an ITV afternoon staple, meaning a generation watched it while sick and off school. It was ultimately canned to make room for cricket in the Channel Nine schedules. The Young Doctors holds the unwelcome distinction, rare among long-running Aussie shows, of never winning a single award. Testament to its quality. 18. Sunset Beach (1997-1999) Masterminded by soap supremo Aaron Spelling, this California melodrama was shallow, shiny and shameless. Sunset Beach peddled outrageous plotlines (hot tub fights! Evil twins! Secret turkey-baster impregnation!) and featured knowing celebrity cameos from the likes of Jerry Springer. When it won a cult following on Channel 5, it became the only US daytime soap to become a hit in the UK. 17. Triangle (1981-1983) What could be more glamorous than a soap set on a North Sea ferry? Sailing from Felixstowe to Gothenburg, Amsterdam and back, it was supposed to be a British take on The Love Boat. Unfortunately, grey skies made it look depressingly gloomy and the crew all got seasick. Larry Lamb was the hunky chief engineer; Kate O\u2019Mara the resident minx \u2013 memorably sunbathing topless on what was clearly a freezing cold deck. Terry Wogan had a hoot mocking it on his Radio 2 breakfast show. Anchors away. 16. Take the High Road (1980-2003) The late queen mother was a fan of this kilt-clad soap about the fictional village of Glendarroch. It was set around a picturesque estate on the bonnie banks of Loch Lomond, with lairds, livestock, purple heather and a fiddly, folky theme tune. Most ITV regions dropped it in the mid-90s when its title was shortened to High Road but it retained a loyal fanbase in Scotland and Northern Ireland until it took the low road to the TV afterlife. 15. Angels (1975-1983) Part of a long line of medical soaps \u2013 Dr Finlay\u2019s Casebook, A Country Practice, Emergency Ward 10 and General Hospital almost made our cut \u2013 this female-led mould-breaker was dubbed \u201cthe Z-Cars of nursing\u201d and followed student nurses at the fictional Saint Angela\u2019s in Battersea, later relocating to Birmingham\u2019s Heath Green hospital. Its gritty authenticity was thanks to the cast working on real NHS wards to get hands-on experience. Producer Julia Smith and script editor Tony Holland later reunited to create EastEnders. 14. Sons and Daughters (1982-1987) It\u2019s hard to believe now but, at its peak, this Dallas-inspired spin on Romeo and Juliet notched up six million viewers on daytime ITV. It followed the romantically tangled lives of two Australian families \u2013 the wealthy Hamiltons from Sydney and the working-class Palmers from Melbourne. Its arch villain was scheming matriarch Patricia \u201cPat the Rat\u201d Hamilton; when leading lady Rowena Wallace decided to quit, they simply had her character fly to Rio for extensive cosmetic surgery and return as a different actor. 13. Albion Market (1985-1986) Pitched as a northern version of EastEnders, which launched on the BBC six months earlier, ITV\u2019s effort was set in a covered market in Salford \u2013 and proved about as thrilling as that sounds. Storylines were hard-hitting but action became mired in the day-to-day tedium of stallholders. The cast included Anthony Booth, father-in-law of the future prime minister, Tony Blair, as the pub landlord. It was axed after exactly 100 episodes. 12. Melrose Place (1992-1999) An early hit for the king of high-end trash, Darren Star (of Sex and the City and Emily in Paris pedigree), this Fox soap about hot young things living in the titular West Hollywood apartment complex was enjoyably over the top. It was populated by fashion designers, heart surgeons, ad execs and aerobics instructors, with Heather Locklear having a ball as a Joan Collins-style superbitch. Part of the Beverly Hills 90210 franchise, it spawned its own spin-off: the even more telegenic Models Inc. 11. Park Avenue (1988-1992) The world\u2019s first and only teletext soap ran on ITV\u2019s service Oracle. Six to 10 pages of text would appear daily at 4pm. Each episode began with a \u201cStory so far\u201d catchup, before launching into a heady brew of sex and scandal in the fictional town of Parkfield. It riffed on topical events, and fans could vote on outcomes to storylines. Despite the niche format, it ran for 1,500 episodes, coming to an end when Oracle shut down. 10. Night and Day (2001-2003) Comparisons to Twin Peaks and a Kylie theme song? No wonder this stylish 00s mystery soap became cult viewing among teens. When a girl from Greenwich disappears on her 16th birthday, the lives of the families on her street become darkly intertwined. Buffy-influenced experimentation with frozen time, flash forwards, memories and ghosts made this refreshingly edgy fare. Familiar faces in the cast included Clarke Peters, Shane Richie, Lesley Joseph, Glynis Barber and Bradley Walsh. 9. Families (1990-1993) An attempt to mix the sunny escapism of Australian soaps with homegrown familiarity, this Granada crossover followed two clans \u2013 one in Cheshire, one in Sydney \u2013 connected by an adulterous jetset businessman. Created by the late, great Kay Mellor, gritty storylines covered such topics as murder, incest, drugs and sex work. The talent wasn\u2019t too shabby either: Russell T Davies was one of the writers, while a teenage Jude Law starred for two years. 8. Falcon Crest (1981-1990) The so-bad-it\u2019s-good-CBS supersoap was basically \u201cDallas with grapes\u201d. It revolved around feuding family factions in California\u2019s fictitious Tuscany Valley. As tyrannical wine-making matriarch Angela Channing (Oscar-winner Jane Wyman) presided over her vineyard empire, the fine vintages were washed down with vats of backstabbing, bed-hopping and a seemingly endless supply of children born out of wedlock. Cheers! 7. Family Affairs (1997-2005) Former Channel 5 director of programmes Kevin Lygo damned this soap with faint praise, saying: \u201cIf you forced yourself to watch it, you\u2019d be surprised. It\u2019s not as bad as you think.\u201d Kicking off the channel\u2019s launch night lineup, Family Affairs hit headlines for featuring a flash of naked bum. It shared west London locations with police stalwart The Bill, while a young Idris Elba was a regular at riverside bar The Lock. It had a higher density of LGBTQ+ characters than any other British soap, was praised for its diverse cast and won awards for an NSPCC-backed paedophilia storyline. 6. Peyton Place (1964-1969) Widely acknowledged as the first primetime US soap, this landmark ABC series aired in black-and-white for the first half of its five-year run before switching to new-fangled colour. Inspired by Coronation Street, it was set in a seemingly idyllic New England town \u2013 which, naturally, was a hotbed of love, lust, dark secrets and simmering tensions. The starry cast included Mia Farrow, Gena Rowlands, Leslie Nielsen and Ryan O\u2019Neal. Producer Paul Monash refused to admit it was a soap, calling it a \u201chigh-class anthology drama\u201d. So a soap, then? 5. Revelations (1994-1996) \u201cWhen the Church of England started ordaining women, I thought \u2018Yes! We can do a lesbian vicar!\u2019\u201d Co-created by Russell T Davies, this raunchy late-night romp was a trailblazing treat.

That female vicar was the first openly gay character written by Davies, who went on to create Queer As Folk and It\u2019s a Sin. 4. Dynasty (1981-1989) Alongside Dallas, the epitome of shoulder-padded primetime 80s excess. Aaron Spelling\u2019s addictively camp classic chronicled the gilded existences and epic feuds of a super-rich Denver family, headed by oil tycoon Blake Carrington (John Forsythe), who \u201clived and sinned\u201d in a 48-room mansion. It was most memorable for the bitter rivalry between Blake\u2019s ex-wife, Alexis (a never better Joan Collins), and his secretary turned current spouse, Krystle (Linda Evans). A catfight in a koi pond, a plane crash, a wedding massacre and an evil Krystle doppelganger were some of its wildest moments. 3. Crossroads (1964-1988, 2001-2003) It\u2019s best known nowadays as the wobbly setted West Midlands saga parodied in Victoria Wood\u2019s Acorn Antiques \u2013 but at its height Crossroads was huge, pulling in a peak of 15 million viewers. It centred on the fictional Crossroads motel, run by Meg Richardson (Noele Gordon, whose unceremonious sacking was recently the subject of its own drama, Nolly). Kitschy, creaky and melodramatic, it was like a Brummie telenovela. Benny Hawkins, Amy Turtle, Shughie McFee, Adam Chance \u2026 the characters\u2019 names alone are enough to prompt a nostalgia rush for those of a certain age. 2. Dallas (1978-1991) Sue Ellen\u2019s trembling lips! Bobby in the shower! Set on the sprawling Southfork ranch and in the offices of the family company, Ewing Oil, the CBS smash followed the power struggles and torrid private lives of Stetson-wearing, bourbon-guzzling Texas tycoons with names like Digger, Dusty and Punk.

The \u201cWho shot JR?\u201d cliffhanger became a global obsession, as did the bonkers plot twist when the entire previous season was all a dream. 1.

The trial, which comes almost a decade after initial investigations started, threatens to undermine her National Rally (RN) party\u2019s efforts to polish its image before the 2027 presidential election, which many believe she could win. On Wednesday, the Paris prosecutor requested a \u20ac300,000 (\u00a3249,439) fine, five years in prison and an ineligibility sentence against Le Pen, with provisional execution \u2013 meaning the ban on running for public office would take immediate effect. If the court finds her guilty of the charges with this provisional execution, Le Pen will not be able to run in elections even if she appeals against the judgment. The trial runs until 27 November, after which the judges will retire to consider their verdict and consider what sentence to hand down, taking into account the prosecutor\u2019s requests. The verdict is likely to be announced in early 2025. Le Pen, the RN party, and 24 others \u2013 party officials, employees, former lawmakers and parliamentary assistants \u2013 are accused of using European parliament money to pay staff in France who were working for their party, which at the time was called the National Front. The RN, like other far-right parties across the continent, is riding high after a strong performance in European elections in June. \u201cThe law applies to all\u201d, the prosecutor Nicolas Barret told the court, as Le Pen sat in the front row of the defendants\u2019 benches, adding that the ban would \u201cprohibit the defendants from running in future local or national elections\u201d. He demanded a five-year jail sentence for Le Pen, calling for at least two years of that to be a \u201cconvertible\u201d custodial sentence, meaning there would be a possibility of partial release. \u201cI think the prosecutors\u2019 wish is to deprive the French people of the ability to vote for who they want,\u201d Le Pen later said. The alleged fake jobs system, which was first flagged in 2015, covers parliamentary assistant contracts between 2004 and 2016. Prosecutors say the assistants worked exclusively for the party outside parliament. Addressing the trial last month, Le Pen said she was innocent. \u201cI have absolutely no sense of having committed the slightest irregularity, or the slightest illegal act,\u201d she said. Questioned last month about how exactly she selected her presumed parliamentary aides, and what their tasks were, Le Pen gave general answers, or said she could not remember. If convicted, Le Pen would be able to lodge an appeal. European parliament authorities said the legislature had lost \u20ac3m through the jobs scheme. The RN has paid back \u20ac1m, which it says is not an admission of guilt. Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report",

The treaty principles bill was tabled by the libertarian Act party \u2013 a minor partner in New Zealand\u2019s coalition government \u2013 and passed its first reading on Thursday, amid scathing speeches and disruptions. A vote on the bill was momentarily suspended, when opposition parties and people in the public gallery joined in a haka (M\u0101ori dance or challenge), led by the Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke, who proceeded to rip up a copy of the bill. The bill seeks to remove a set of well-established principles that has flowed from New Zealand\u2019s founding document, the treaty of Waitangi \u2013 an agreement signed in 1840 between more than 500 M\u0101ori chiefs and the crown, and which is instrumental in upholding M\u0101ori rights. The principles of the treaty have been developed over 50 years by courts, tribunals and successive governments to help guide the relationship between M\u0101ori and ruling authorities and iron out differences in interpretations over the English and M\u0101ori texts of the original treaty. Many principles have been developed and continue to evolve, but the most recognised are broadly defined as participation, partnership, protection, and redress. They have been used in efforts to revitalise the M\u0101ori language, including making it an official language, and were used to establish a M\u0101ori health authority to reverse poor health outcomes for M\u0101ori, which the coalition government dismantled this year. Critics of the bill say Act\u2019s proposal undermines the treaty and its principles, which they believe threaten M\u0101ori rights and promote anti-M\u0101ori rhetoric. There has been significant public backlash to the bill, with thousands of people joining a nine-day h\u012bkoi (protest march) this week. Starting at the tip of the North Island, participants are expected to arrive at parliament on Tuesday. More than 40 king\u2019s counsel lawyers also wrote an open letter to the prime minister, Christopher Luxon, and the attorney general, Judith Collins, urging them to abandon the bill. Speaking in the house, Act\u2019s leader, David Seymour, said the principles \u201cafford M\u0101ori different rights from other New Zealanders \u2026 The purpose of this bill is break this parliament\u2019s 49 years of silence to define the principles in law so it is crystal clear what the treaty means to modern New Zealanders\u201d. Seymour\u2019s address was met with groans and exclamations of disapproval from opposition parties, prompting the speaker of the house to repeatedly ask for the \u201cbarrage\u201d of rebuttals to stop. Labour\u2019s Willie Jackson followed Seymour with a withering rebuke of the bill and its architect. \u201cShame, shame, shame, on you David Seymour,\u201d he said. \u201cI said some time ago that [Seymour] was the most dangerous politician in New Zealand, and that has come to pass. \u201cThe principles are clear \u2013 they are about partnership, equity, active protection and redress \u2013 why does this offend the minister so much? \u2026 This bill will undermine M\u0101ori rights but still David Seymour persists with this disgusting piece of legislation.\u201d Jackson ended his speech by calling Seymour a liar, and was forced to leave the house when he refused to retract his statement. The Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori co-leader Rawiri Waititi delivered a similarly impassioned address, likening the Act party to the \u201cKKK with a swipecard to the Beehive [New Zealand\u2019s parliament]\u201d and calling them \u201ccomplicit in the euthanising of the treaty of Waitangi\u201d. Opposition parties called on coalition MPs to vote down the bill. \u201cMy question to MPs is: are you here to hold on to power at any cost, or are you here to do the right thing?\u201d said Chl\u00f6e Swarbrick, the Green party co-leader. \u201cAre you here to listen to your conscience, or are you here to give it all up on one of the most significant votes in this house in our lifetimes?

      "body": "<p>In the grand churn of the money machine that is modern football, it ranks as a fairly small deal. But when Liverpool <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/22/liverpool-leipzig-slot-adidas-kit-deal\">recently announced</a> they will earn more than \u00a360m ($76.3m) a year from a new kit deal with Adidas starting next season, the reaction from the club\u2019s supporters across social media said a lot about the nature of modern fandom. Apart from the habitual grumbles about what this might mean for the design of the team\u2019s kit, fans mostly seemed to respond to the announcement in one of two ways: why doesn\u2019t the new deal bring the club into line with the \u00a390m ($114.3m) that Manchester United receives from Adidas for a comparable arrangement? And more pressingly: what kind of squad investment can an extra few million pounds a year secure? \u201cEnough to pay Virgil,\u201d declared one user on Reddit. \u201cDoes that mean we will buy a RB and a 10?\u201d asked another.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/13/gianni-infantino-to-dodge-spotlight-with-2026-world-cup-draw-held-virtually\">Gianni Infantino to dodge spotlight with 2026 World Cup draw held virtually</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These are, of course, completely normal reactions; any other club announcing any kind of commercial \u201cwin\u201d would face similar responses from its supporters. But they highlight the extent to which we, as fans, have all become psychologically colonized by the grubby extractionism that defines the modern Premier League, applauding from the sidelines as a new content deal or shirt sponsorship or asset sale or fresh suite of unaffordable subscription packages lurches into view on the club balance sheet. That seat upgrade \u201clayer\u201d and points-based VIP fan tier might be part of the commercial drift that\u2019s making football less affordable, carrying it ever further from the communities it claims to represent, but if they nab us a quality back-up keeper to put pressure on that number one chronically fumbling under the high ball? Well, maybe they\u2019re not so bad after all.</p> <p>The quest for revenue is the defining struggle of modern football, and many fans correctly see higher revenue as the surest route to on-field glory; balance sheet improvement and squad improvement now go hand in hand. Fans, faced with these economic realities, have become unwitting cheerleaders for the untrammeled commercialization of the sport, for the exploitation of minor seams of commercial value and the manipulation of regulatory loopholes, for the dark administrative arts that backroom operators rely on to give their clubs an edge. The depth of anger that many supporters feel toward referees for perceived on-field injustices and biases \u2013 some of which, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/12/fa-launches-own-investigation-into-referee-david-coote-over-klopp-comments\">recent events suggest</a>, may have a legitimate anchor in reality \u2013 has its converse in the cool indifference that greets any evidence of rule-skirting in the corporate suite.</p> <p>We all have that group of Chelsea supporters in our lives who are vocally thrilled at the club\u2019s dexterity in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/19/chelseas-765m-hotel-deals-raise-questions-over-psr-compliance\">flogging off their own hotels to themselves</a> at generous prices in a bid to squeak under the league\u2019s loss limits; we all know that one Man City fan comically untroubled by the 115 charges hanging over the club they love. Even \u2013 or perhaps especially \u2013 as the Premier League enters a new era of regulation and accountability, the temptation for fans to view their own clubs\u2019 off-field chicanery as part of the \u201cgame\u201d of modern football has only grown. Regulation, if anything, offers manipulative club owners another \u201cenemy\u201d against which to mobilize fan support: it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that Manchester City fans cheered the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/07/manchester-city-premier-league-tribunal-verdict\">recent arbitration ruling</a> against the Premier League\u2019s rules on associated party transactions, or that Chelsea fans were buoyed by the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5547223/2024/06/06/premier-league-ffp-loophole/\">failure</a> of a motion at the league\u2019s annual general meeting in June to ban clubs from booking artificial windfall profits on property sales. Never mind that both the ATP rules and a limitation on Chelsea-style hotel sales would help create a fairer league; all that matters is the win, the extra bit of financial juice, that boost to the bottom line.</p> <p>Fans have agency in all of this, of course, and not all fans behave this way. But it\u2019s club owners and the sport\u2019s administrators, rather than fans themselves, who bear the responsibility for this reduction of football to an exercise in financial and regulatory squeezing, a soulless game of numbers and loopholes. Emotional though they may be by nature, fans cheering these advances off the field are responding in an entirely rational manner to the world as it\u2019s presented to them. More money, more deals, more maneuvering around the rules: such are the routes to success in the modern Premier League, and with them invariably come more litigation in the courts and tribunals, more contestation of the Premier League\u2019s authority, more moral equivalence, a deeper league-wide drift into cynical amorality and transactionalism. These values have now seeped into the very bloodstream of the sport.</p> <p>As the arrival of Big Money in European soccer has become routinized, debates around the ethics and morality of club ownership lose their initiating bite, and football as a whole shuffles toward a numb acceptance of its new status as a plaything of global capital, supporting the team on the field and cheering the off-field corporate trickery that keeps teams competitive have merged into a single culture of whatever-it-takes fandom. This isn\u2019t simply a matter of following events off the field, which have always been the stuff of debate among supporters; it\u2019s about the emergence of a collective mindset in which fans don\u2019t simply accept the commercialization of all aspects of modern soccer but celebrate each successive marker of money\u2019s tightening grip over the sport. Anything that allows clubs to keep growing, keep spending, keep chasing the top players while remaining within the letter of the law \u2013 no matter what it means for the sport\u2019s overall accessibility, sustainability or connection to community \u2013 is a discussion-board toast waiting to happen. Club owners and administrators have, of course, done their bit to stoke and exploit this mindset; the science of \u201ccustomer engagement\u201d, along with a host of strategies designed to gamify and financialize the fan experience, have encouraged and rewarded blind, vocal club loyalty among fans while disincentivizing dissent.</p> <p>None of us who follow football are immune to the power of this devious rationalism. As fans, we\u2019re all petty traders and unethical accountants now, managing our own shadow ledger of the mind to keep track of where our clubs can go long, take profit and squeeze out an extra few bucks at the margins to afford that attacking but defensively solid left back/20-goal-a-season No 9/squad utility who can play across the back four but also has a head for goal from set pieces/technically adept and positionally secure midfield anchor who will unlock a glorious future of sustained on-field success. Fandom has become yet another realm of human life that\u2019s been captured by gambling and speculation; fans are emotionally and mentally engaged in the league-wide search for the highest yield with the smallest outlay, becoming footsoldiers of the extraction economy. Players, meanwhile, are now seen as chattels \u2013 units of value on a balance sheet pumping up the assets column or liabilities dragging the operation down. Squads are increasingly assembled in the manner of venture capital portfolios, as a volley of scattergun bets on untested products.</p> <p>In the long run, the only people who benefit from the Premier League\u2019s new gamified climate of risk-taking and rule-bending are the billionaires and private equity parasites with control of the clubs. But as fans, we are the useful idiots turning their schemes for self-enrichment into a cultural prize. As we hail the latest streaming deal, merch tie-in, gaming partnership or tribunal win, football continues its transformation into an asset class, striding blithely into the jaws of the market.</p>",

And more pressingly: what kind of squad investment can an extra few million pounds a year secure? \u201cEnough to pay Virgil,\u201d declared one user on Reddit. \u201cDoes that mean we will buy a RB and a 10?\u201d asked another. These are, of course, completely normal reactions; any other club announcing any kind of commercial \u201cwin\u201d would face similar responses from its supporters. But they highlight the extent to which we, as fans, have all become psychologically colonized by the grubby extractionism that defines the modern Premier League, applauding from the sidelines as a new content deal or shirt sponsorship or asset sale or fresh suite of unaffordable subscription packages lurches into view on the club balance sheet. That seat upgrade \u201clayer\u201d and points-based VIP fan tier might be part of the commercial drift that\u2019s making football less affordable, carrying it ever further from the communities it claims to represent, but if they nab us a quality back-up keeper to put pressure on that number one chronically fumbling under the high ball? Well, maybe they\u2019re not so bad after all. The quest for revenue is the defining struggle of modern football, and many fans correctly see higher revenue as the surest route to on-field glory; balance sheet improvement and squad improvement now go hand in hand. Fans, faced with these economic realities, have become unwitting cheerleaders for the untrammeled commercialization of the sport, for the exploitation of minor seams of commercial value and the manipulation of regulatory loopholes, for the dark administrative arts that backroom operators rely on to give their clubs an edge. The depth of anger that many supporters feel toward referees for perceived on-field injustices and biases \u2013 some of which, recent events suggest, may have a legitimate anchor in reality \u2013 has its converse in the cool indifference that greets any evidence of rule-skirting in the corporate suite. We all have that group of Chelsea supporters in our lives who are vocally thrilled at the club\u2019s dexterity in flogging off their own hotels to themselves at generous prices in a bid to squeak under the league\u2019s loss limits; we all know that one Man City fan comically untroubled by the 115 charges hanging over the club they love. Even \u2013 or perhaps especially \u2013 as the Premier League enters a new era of regulation and accountability, the temptation for fans to view their own clubs\u2019 off-field chicanery as part of the \u201cgame\u201d of modern football has only grown. Regulation, if anything, offers manipulative club owners another \u201cenemy\u201d against which to mobilize fan support: it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that Manchester City fans cheered the recent arbitration ruling against the Premier League\u2019s rules on associated party transactions, or that Chelsea fans were buoyed by the failure of a motion at the league\u2019s annual general meeting in June to ban clubs from booking artificial windfall profits on property sales. Never mind that both the ATP rules and a limitation on Chelsea-style hotel sales would help create a fairer league; all that matters is the win, the extra bit of financial juice, that boost to the bottom line. Fans have agency in all of this, of course, and not all fans behave this way. But it\u2019s club owners and the sport\u2019s administrators, rather than fans themselves, who bear the responsibility for this reduction of football to an exercise in financial and regulatory squeezing, a soulless game of numbers and loopholes. Emotional though they may be by nature, fans cheering these advances off the field are responding in an entirely rational manner to the world as it\u2019s presented to them. More money, more deals, more maneuvering around the rules: such are the routes to success in the modern Premier League, and with them invariably come more litigation in the courts and tribunals, more contestation of the Premier League\u2019s authority, more moral equivalence, a deeper league-wide drift into cynical amorality and transactionalism. These values have now seeped into the very bloodstream of the sport. As the arrival of Big Money in European soccer has become routinized, debates around the ethics and morality of club ownership lose their initiating bite, and football as a whole shuffles toward a numb acceptance of its new status as a plaything of global capital, supporting the team on the field and cheering the off-field corporate trickery that keeps teams competitive have merged into a single culture of whatever-it-takes fandom. This isn\u2019t simply a matter of following events off the field, which have always been the stuff of debate among supporters; it\u2019s about the emergence of a collective mindset in which fans don\u2019t simply accept the commercialization of all aspects of modern soccer but celebrate each successive marker of money\u2019s tightening grip over the sport. Anything that allows clubs to keep growing, keep spending, keep chasing the top players while remaining within the letter of the law \u2013 no matter what it means for the sport\u2019s overall accessibility, sustainability or connection to community \u2013 is a discussion-board toast waiting to happen. Club owners and administrators have, of course, done their bit to stoke and exploit this mindset; the science of \u201ccustomer engagement\u201d, along with a host of strategies designed to gamify and financialize the fan experience, have encouraged and rewarded blind, vocal club loyalty among fans while disincentivizing dissent. None of us who follow football are immune to the power of this devious rationalism. As fans, we\u2019re all petty traders and unethical accountants now, managing our own shadow ledger of the mind to keep track of where our clubs can go long, take profit and squeeze out an extra few bucks at the margins to afford that attacking but defensively solid left back/20-goal-a-season No 9/squad utility who can play across the back four but also has a head for goal from set pieces/technically adept and positionally secure midfield anchor who will unlock a glorious future of sustained on-field success. Fandom has become yet another realm of human life that\u2019s been captured by gambling and speculation; fans are emotionally and mentally engaged in the league-wide search for the highest yield with the smallest outlay, becoming footsoldiers of the extraction economy. Players, meanwhile, are now seen as chattels \u2013 units of value on a balance sheet pumping up the assets column or liabilities dragging the operation down. Squads are increasingly assembled in the manner of venture capital portfolios, as a volley of scattergun bets on untested products. In the long run, the only people who benefit from the Premier League\u2019s new gamified climate of risk-taking and rule-bending are the billionaires and private equity parasites with control of the clubs. But as fans, we are the useful idiots turning their schemes for self-enrichment into a cultural prize. As we hail the latest streaming deal, merch tie-in, gaming partnership or tribunal win, football continues its transformation into an asset class, striding blithely into the jaws of the market.",

      "body": "<p>I have one thing in common with Andrew Lloyd Webber: we both saw John Gielgud play Prospero at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in 1957. The big difference is that, since Lord Lloyd Webber now owns the theatre, he was able to suggest Shakespeare be revived at the Lane for the first time in 67 years in the shape of a new Jamie Lloyd production of The Tempest starring Sigourney Weaver. It is an imaginative piece of casting and set me thinking, as someone who has looked on a storm of Tempests, about Prosperos of the past.</p> <p>The play itself is, as Anne Barton once wrote, \u201can extraordinarily obliging work of art\u201d: it is open to multiple meanings and endlessly diverse stagings. Prospero can also be played in a variety of ways but, surveying the 40 or so productions I have seen, I have picked out four key interpretations. There is Prospero the magus, the impresario, the colonialist and the despot. The categories are far from being mutually exclusive. Indeed one sign of a great Prospero is the ability to combine them all but at least they give a handy guide to the role\u2019s complexities.</p>    <p>The magus is an obvious starting point since the character is thought to have been based on John Dee who was accused of sorcery at Cambridge and who later became astrologer to Elizabeth I. When Gielgud played Prospero \u2013 for the third time \u2013 in Peter Hall\u2019s 1974 National Theatre production he actually resembled Dee, in his black skull cap and white ruff. But it was in Hall\u2019s 1988 National production that I felt I was witnessing the supernatural. Michael Bryant\u2019s Prospero was a necromancer who resembled Faust dabbling with dark forces. When Bryant told us \u201cgraves at my command / Have waked their sleepers, oped and let \u2019em forth,\u201d you felt that he was a traumatised figure anxious to renounce more than simply \u201crough\u201d magic.</p> <p>If Prospero is a diabolist, he can also be seen as a surrogate director staging his own drama of revenge. In 1988 \u2013 a year that saw four major productions \u2013 two stood out as examples of meta-theatre. In Declan Donnellan\u2019s Cheek by Jowl version Timothy Walker\u2019s Prospero was a tyrannical actor-manager watching much of the action from a stage dressing-room. More elaborate was Haruhiko Joh\u2019s Prospero in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/yukio-ninagawa\">Yukio Ninagawa</a>\u2019s Noh-inspired production that had him kick-starting each scene with a handclap. The problem with this approach, however, is that it overplays Prospero\u2019s omnipotence and drains the other characters of autonomy.</p> <p>The more fashionable line these days is to treat Prospero as a symbol of colonialism. In Britain it was Jonathan Miller who, having read a book by Octave Mannoni about the French colonisation of Madagascar, pioneered this interpretation in a 1970 production that had Graham Crowden as a touchily neurotic Prospero lording it over Norman Beaton\u2019s Ariel and Rudolph Walker\u2019s Caliban whose cry of \u201cThis island\u2019s mine\u201d carried extra weight. Countless productions have followed in Miller\u2019s wake including one he himself did in 1988 with Max von Sydow as Prospero \u2013 but few with such subtlety. What I remember from Miller\u2019s original is Prospero\u2019s belated acquisition of sympathy in acknowledging his guilt and the need for a transference of power.</p>    <p>This reading shades into the final category of Prospero as despot, which all the best actors deploy. I remember Gielgud in that 1957 Peter Brook production as an angry, bare-chested figure who made you feel it was touch and go whether he would forgive his enemies. But the tendency to tyranny was there in Derek Jacobi (1982), John Wood (1988) and, most recently, Simon Russell Beale in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/18/the-tempest-review-simon-russell-beale-rsc\">Gregory Doran\u2019s hi-tech 2016 production</a>.

The first female Prospero I saw was Valerie Braddell who, in a 1981 version, made the usurped Queen of Milan a motherly figure at one point taking Caliban into her protective arms. Vanessa Redgrave in 2000 was a physically commanding presence but I regret missing Harriet Walter\u2019s Prospero in an all-female production at the Donmar in 2016. If I\u2019ve learned anything over the years, it is that Prospero is a role that brings out the peculiar qualities of its interpreter.

Everyone in this room knows just how powerful a being you are and that\u2019s why we\u2019re all here, including Netflix. One day, if I run for president, I\u2019d be honoured to have you as my vice-president or maybe secretary of defence. You\u2019ll be in charge of the red button.

It leads the splurge of content which Netflix hopes will entice millions of viewers to watch Jake Paul\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/13/mike-tyson-vs-jake-paul-fight-preview-feature-november-15\">embarrassing fight </a>against the 58-year-old Mike Tyson on Friday night in Arlington.</p> <p>In this sun-kissed corner of north Texas, a week after Donald Trump sealed his return to the White House, the hype intensifies. Jake and Logan, two brothers from Ohio aged 27 and 29, are ardent Trump supporters and, like their political hero, they peddle a constant stream of bullshit in the knowledge that some of it will eventually stick.</p> <p>Jake can be heard proclaiming that \u201cI\u2019m a professional boxer, knocking people the fuck out\u201d and \u201cI could become the next Muhammad Ali\u201d. His big brother shrugs: \u201cOf course he\u2019s delusional. We all are. It\u2019s why we are where we are \u2013 until it becomes a reality. That\u2019s the beauty of Jake Paul.\u201d</p> <p>Delusions of grandeur can become a kind of grim truth. Maybe, with the world turned upside down, Logan Paul will become president one day. There is more chance of that happening than Jake becoming a great boxer. He has applied himself with some seriousness, and trains hard, but it is difficult to give any credence to Paul\u2019s claims of boxing authenticity.</p> <p>He has had 11 fights so far and only one of his opponents, Tommy Fury, was younger than him and a professional boxer. Paul lost that bout to an average scrapper whose boxing credentials rest on the fact that he is Tyson Fury\u2019s younger brother. Tommy Fury is also famous for being a contestant on Love Island and, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/26/tommy-fury-edges-youtuber-turned-boxer-jake-paul-by-split-decision\">since beating Paul in February 2023</a>, he has had only one further bout \u2013 against KSI, another YouTuber.</p>    <p>But there is a more meaningful story about Paul. In the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrFlg1gRvKU\">Netflix documentary</a> he alleges that his father was violent towards him. Greg Paul denies any wrongdoing but he also implies that his boys should be grateful that he was so tough on them. Logan agrees that Jake was traumatised by his childhood but, together, they began making YouTube videos as teenagers which soon drew in millions of subscribers.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re fucking media whores who make content on phones, edit it on iMovie, post it on the internet and get people talking,\u201d Logan says. Jake, meanwhile, suggests: \u201cWhen they made the word \u2018influencer\u2019 they were talking about us.\u201d</p> <p>At 18, Jake was rich enough to buy a house worth $7.4m (\u00a35.8m) but trading on his infamy wore him down. His brother and father were concerned that Jake might take his own life but then, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/aug/27/ksi-logan-paul-youtubers-fight-boxing-match-manchester-arena\">in August 2018</a>, boxing apparently transformed him. The Pauls launched YouTube boxing when they flew to England and Logan drew with his British rival, the big-talking KSI. Jake and Deji Olatunji, KSI\u2019s brother, fought on the undercard.</p> <p>Jake was being beaten up in front of a packed and baying Manchester Arena. He says: \u201cI felt like I was dying \u2026 and I fucking loved it \u2026 some other element inside me took over.\u201d He won the fight and, sick of making YouTube content and being hated, decided to become a professional fighter. \u201cBoxing reinvigorated something inside me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt made me feel alive again.\u201d</p> <p>Jake Paul seems sincere in appreciating the self-worth that boxing can instil and since then, while beating a series of former UFC fighters, he has built a 10-1 record which looks decent on paper and flimsy in a proper ring. But he is smart and grinned with delight when, having beaten the then 47-year-old MMA great Anderson Silva, he turned to the cameras to reveal that the pay-per-view buys had reached 1.3m at \u201c$50 a pop\u201d.</p> <p>There are rumours that Paul could make $40m against Tyson, which is ridiculous money for a novice who has none of the talent or hard-won ringcraft of the world heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk. But rather than getting angry it\u2019s best to move on with a little nod in acknowledgement of Paul\u2019s business savvy.</p> <p>President Trump spews out racism and misogyny. At his recent election rally at Madison Square Garden, Trump was preceded on a stage by an aspiring joker who described Puerto Rico as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/29/trump-rally-puerto-rico-joke\">floating island of garbage</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Yet Paul loves living in Puerto Rico and he is also passionate about supporting women\u2019s boxing.

      "bodyText": "Jake Paul is having his hands wrapped in the locker room as his older brother, Logan, who also became rich and famous on YouTube, speaks earnestly to him. \u201cYou\u2019ve expanded your mind, your circle, your emotional intelligence and your capabilities,\u201d Logan tells Jake. \u201cFrom making silly home videos to changing the entire landscape of combat sports. Everyone in this room knows just how powerful a being you are and that\u2019s why we\u2019re all here, including Netflix. One day, if I run for president, I\u2019d be honoured to have you as my vice-president or maybe secretary of defence. You\u2019ll be in charge of the red button. The all-powerful nuke that also happens to be at the end of your right hand.\u201d At least Jake laughs softly when his brother mentions the absurdity of running for president on a gleaming new Netflix documentary. It leads the splurge of content which Netflix hopes will entice millions of viewers to watch Jake Paul\u2019s embarrassing fight against the 58-year-old Mike Tyson on Friday night in Arlington. In this sun-kissed corner of north Texas, a week after Donald Trump sealed his return to the White House, the hype intensifies. Jake and Logan, two brothers from Ohio aged 27 and 29, are ardent Trump supporters and, like their political hero, they peddle a constant stream of bullshit in the knowledge that some of it will eventually stick. Jake can be heard proclaiming that \u201cI\u2019m a professional boxer, knocking people the fuck out\u201d and \u201cI could become the next Muhammad Ali\u201d. His big brother shrugs: \u201cOf course he\u2019s delusional. We all are. It\u2019s why we are where we are \u2013 until it becomes a reality. That\u2019s the beauty of Jake Paul.\u201d Delusions of grandeur can become a kind of grim truth. Maybe, with the world turned upside down, Logan Paul will become president one day. There is more chance of that happening than Jake becoming a great boxer. He has applied himself with some seriousness, and trains hard, but it is difficult to give any credence to Paul\u2019s claims of boxing authenticity. He has had 11 fights so far and only one of his opponents, Tommy Fury, was younger than him and a professional boxer. Paul lost that bout to an average scrapper whose boxing credentials rest on the fact that he is Tyson Fury\u2019s younger brother. Tommy Fury is also famous for being a contestant on Love Island and, since beating Paul in February 2023, he has had only one further bout \u2013 against KSI, another YouTuber. But there is a more meaningful story about Paul. In the Netflix documentary he alleges that his father was violent towards him. Greg Paul denies any wrongdoing but he also implies that his boys should be grateful that he was so tough on them. Logan agrees that Jake was traumatised by his childhood but, together, they began making YouTube videos as teenagers which soon drew in millions of subscribers. \u201cWe\u2019re fucking media whores who make content on phones, edit it on iMovie, post it on the internet and get people talking,\u201d Logan says. Jake, meanwhile, suggests: \u201cWhen they made the word \u2018influencer\u2019 they were talking about us.\u201d At 18, Jake was rich enough to buy a house worth $7.4m (\u00a35.8m) but trading on his infamy wore him down. His brother and father were concerned that Jake might take his own life but then, in August 2018, boxing apparently transformed him. The Pauls launched YouTube boxing when they flew to England and Logan drew with his British rival, the big-talking KSI. Jake and Deji Olatunji, KSI\u2019s brother, fought on the undercard. Jake was being beaten up in front of a packed and baying Manchester Arena. He says: \u201cI felt like I was dying \u2026 and I fucking loved it \u2026 some other element inside me took over.\u201d He won the fight and, sick of making YouTube content and being hated, decided to become a professional fighter. \u201cBoxing reinvigorated something inside me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt made me feel alive again.\u201d Jake Paul seems sincere in appreciating the self-worth that boxing can instil and since then, while beating a series of former UFC fighters, he has built a 10-1 record which looks decent on paper and flimsy in a proper ring. But he is smart and grinned with delight when, having beaten the then 47-year-old MMA great Anderson Silva, he turned to the cameras to reveal that the pay-per-view buys had reached 1.3m at \u201c$50 a pop\u201d. There are rumours that Paul could make $40m against Tyson, which is ridiculous money for a novice who has none of the talent or hard-won ringcraft of the world heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk. But rather than getting angry it\u2019s best to move on with a little nod in acknowledgement of Paul\u2019s business savvy. President Trump spews out racism and misogyny. At his recent election rally at Madison Square Garden, Trump was preceded on a stage by an aspiring joker who described Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d. Yet Paul loves living in Puerto Rico and he is also passionate about supporting women\u2019s boxing. He promotes Amanda Serrano, a Puerto Rican woman born in New York, and her life has been transformed. She spent years earning peanuts and gaining little recognition, despite winning world titles at multiple weights. It is rumoured she will make around $8m on Friday night, with her great rival Katie Taylor earning a supposed $6m, as their rematch is the only fight which really matters on the Paul v Tyson card. Jake Paul might be a limited fighter trying to feel better about himself, while raking in obscene amounts of money, but he can feel proud of that. He won\u2019t be the next Muhammad Ali and, hopefully, not the vice-president of the United States either, but he has created a legacy of lasting significance for women in boxing.

      "body": "<p>What is Gary Lineker worth to licence-fee payers? One obvious way to think about that question is to measure what else you could get with his \u00a31.35m pay packet, a large chunk of which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/12/bbc-confirms-gary-lineker-departure-from-match-of-the-day\">has just been offloaded by the BBC</a>: 8,000 television licences, 40 NHS nurses, 26 BBC employees on the corporation\u2019s median salary, eight Keir Starmers, seven Chris Suttons, six Alex Scotts, five Mark Chapmans, or a <a href=\"https://themovemarket.com/tools/propertyprices/32-the-rise-elstree-borehamwood-wd6-3ju\">house somewhere outside Elstree</a>. And that\u2019s mad, obviously. He says the names of the football teams and asks Alan Shearer whether something was a red card or not \u2013 and it can\u2019t take more than a couple of days a week. There is absolutely no way to justify it.</p> <p>The other way of thinking about it is a lot less concrete, and a lot harder to turn into an <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1926923/lee-anderson-gary-lineker-bbc-licence-fee\">overheated demand to scrap the BBC</a>. You could begin with the observation that, as well as being massive and unjustifiable, Lineker\u2019s pay deal cost less than four hundredths of a percent of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-51376255#:~:text=The%20BBC's%20total%20income%20from,%C2%A31.16bn%20in%202023.\">licence fee income</a> this year. You might note how lucky the likes of Amanda Holden and Stephen Mulhern, not obviously more talented, are that their ITV deals are treated as commercially sensitive, and therefore secret.

      "bodyText": "What is Gary Lineker worth to licence-fee payers? One obvious way to think about that question is to measure what else you could get with his \u00a31.35m pay packet, a large chunk of which has just been offloaded by the BBC: 8,000 television licences, 40 NHS nurses, 26 BBC employees on the corporation\u2019s median salary, eight Keir Starmers, seven Chris Suttons, six Alex Scotts, five Mark Chapmans, or a house somewhere outside Elstree. And that\u2019s mad, obviously. He says the names of the football teams and asks Alan Shearer whether something was a red card or not \u2013 and it can\u2019t take more than a couple of days a week. There is absolutely no way to justify it. The other way of thinking about it is a lot less concrete, and a lot harder to turn into an overheated demand to scrap the BBC. You could begin with the observation that, as well as being massive and unjustifiable, Lineker\u2019s pay deal cost less than four hundredths of a percent of licence fee income this year. You might note how lucky the likes of Amanda Holden and Stephen Mulhern, not obviously more talented, are that their ITV deals are treated as commercially sensitive, and therefore secret. And you might also say that in the end, since the BBC has a comfortably larger audience share than any of its commercial rivals, it isn\u2019t that surprising if it has to pay somewhere in the same universe as the going rate. Even so, the decision to part ways with Captain Underpants (or the Match of the Day portion of his service, at least; he will still present live football) is probably the right one.

(Details have not been released \u2013 but how far will \u00a31m go among that number of clubs?)</p> <p>The relaunched competition has been controversial and has faced criticism from some of those it apparently aims to benefit. Barnet, Eastleigh, Solihull and Southend declined to take part and <a href=\"https://www.readingfc.co.uk/news/2024/september/25/pl-nl-cup-withdrawal/\">Reading withdrew</a> because of \u201chigher than expected demands on the squad\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://eastleighfc.com/2024/09/statement-the-national-league-cup/\">Eastleigh announced their withdrawal</a> by questioning why they would help Premier League clubs nurture young talent when, they said, \u201cno compensation\u201d is forthcoming when their academy players depart for bigger clubs.</p> <p>It would be illogical for them to do so, Eastleigh argued, also saying financial rewards for participation were \u201cnegligible\u201d. Extra fixtures would be problematic, they said, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe there is a huge demand for the competition from our supporters.\u201d</p>    <p>That was a fair point. Crowds have been derisory, with only 160 supporters witnessing Wealdstone\u2019s win over Saints. There were 317 to see Brighton Under-21s\u2019 3-2 win at <a href=\"https://www.theshots.co.uk/match-report-brighton-hove-albion-u21s/\">Aldershot on Bonfire Night</a> and 414 at Boston United for a 1-0 win against <a href=\"https://www.bostonunited.co.uk/teams/24809/match-centre/0-6067617/report\">Sunderland Under-21s the next day</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI understand their view,\u201d Taylor said of Eastleigh\u2019s stance. \u201cBut at the same time I understand where this football club is financially. We need the revenue from this competition.\u201d</p> <p>Despite low attendances, Taylor believes the prize fund makes it all worth it. \u201cYes, without a shadow of a doubt,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand that other clubs don\u2019t want to help Premier League teams, but I come at it from a slightly different perspective.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked in a Category 1 academy. To help their development I think it\u2019s a great competition. What they\u2019ve faced against us this evening they won\u2019t get in Under-21s football.\u201d</p> <p>Simon Rusk, the Southampton Under-21s manager, was equally positive. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe get a different type of challenge, individually and collectively. Balls in behind, the physical challenge on set pieces where the lads need to battle.\u201d</p> <p>Rusk acknowledged Taylor\u2019s selection that so starkly contradicted the Premier League\u2019s September announcement that \u201cfirst team\u201d National League sides would take part. \u201cThere\u2019s a reality to it,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving been a first-team manager myself, this would be about game time for others. But for us it\u2019s a gift.\u201d</p>    <p>The reality is that in a packed season, overstretched National League clubs will rotate to manage resources. Injuries sustained competing in a relatively unimportant competition are the biggest fear. \u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is stress our players Saturday-Tuesday throughout the season,\u201d said Taylor.</p> <p>Dorin Gisca \u2013 originally from Moldova and now a loyal Wealdstone supporter who brings his children to every home game \u2013 remains sceptical. \u201cI\u2019m not sure about it because we have to be realistic,\u201d he said before Tuesday\u2019s kick-off. \u201cThis year we have to stay up, we need all the players fit. As it stands we are struggling. It\u2019s only my opinion but I don\u2019t think taking part in this competition is a good idea.\u201d</p> <p>At half-time a Wealdstone source, who asked not to be named, gave a convincing explanation for the competition\u2019s existence. \u201cIt\u2019s a sweetener for getting rid of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/18/fa-cup-replays-and-premier-league-winter-break-scrapped-from-next-season\">FA Cup replays</a>,\u201d he said. \u201cNinety-five per cent of National League clubs were opposed. And why did they stop replays in the first and second rounds, when they don\u2019t impact Premier League clubs? It was illogical but with this they are saying: \u2018Don\u2019t worry guys, we have found some more money for you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It seems clubs such as Wealdstone feel obliged to participate for extra revenue in the absence of potentially lucrative, not to mention life-affirming, FA Cup replays they previously had the chance to earn. Weston-super-Mare\u2019s recent 1-1 draw in 90 minutes at Bristol Rovers would have been one such example, but in the new format, they eventually lost in extra time.</p> <p>All this arguably ignores the fact that football is part of the entertainment industry. What could be termed a glorified training match in front of a handful of fans is obviously a poor substitute for a blood-and-thunder FA Cup tie. Asked for comment on Tuesday, the Premier League pointed to its September <a href=\"https://www.premierleague.com/news/4121350\">announcement</a>. Does the National League Cup deserve its place in an already congested calendar? It depends who you ask.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>This article was amended on 14 November to reflect the four clubs who declined their National League Cup invitations.</em></p></li> </ul>",

It would be illogical for them to do so, Eastleigh argued, also saying financial rewards for participation were \u201cnegligible\u201d. Extra fixtures would be problematic, they said, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe there is a huge demand for the competition from our supporters.\u201d That was a fair point. Crowds have been derisory, with only 160 supporters witnessing Wealdstone\u2019s win over Saints. There were 317 to see Brighton Under-21s\u2019 3-2 win at Aldershot on Bonfire Night and 414 at Boston United for a 1-0 win against Sunderland Under-21s the next day. \u201cI understand their view,\u201d Taylor said of Eastleigh\u2019s stance. \u201cBut at the same time I understand where this football club is financially. We need the revenue from this competition.\u201d Despite low attendances, Taylor believes the prize fund makes it all worth it. \u201cYes, without a shadow of a doubt,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand that other clubs don\u2019t want to help Premier League teams, but I come at it from a slightly different perspective. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in a Category 1 academy. To help their development I think it\u2019s a great competition. What they\u2019ve faced against us this evening they won\u2019t get in Under-21s football.\u201d Simon Rusk, the Southampton Under-21s manager, was equally positive. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe get a different type of challenge, individually and collectively. Balls in behind, the physical challenge on set pieces where the lads need to battle.\u201d Rusk acknowledged Taylor\u2019s selection that so starkly contradicted the Premier League\u2019s September announcement that \u201cfirst team\u201d National League sides would take part. \u201cThere\u2019s a reality to it,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving been a first-team manager myself, this would be about game time for others. But for us it\u2019s a gift.\u201d The reality is that in a packed season, overstretched National League clubs will rotate to manage resources. Injuries sustained competing in a relatively unimportant competition are the biggest fear. \u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is stress our players Saturday-Tuesday throughout the season,\u201d said Taylor. Dorin Gisca \u2013 originally from Moldova and now a loyal Wealdstone supporter who brings his children to every home game \u2013 remains sceptical. \u201cI\u2019m not sure about it because we have to be realistic,\u201d he said before Tuesday\u2019s kick-off. \u201cThis year we have to stay up, we need all the players fit. As it stands we are struggling. It\u2019s only my opinion but I don\u2019t think taking part in this competition is a good idea.\u201d At half-time a Wealdstone source, who asked not to be named, gave a convincing explanation for the competition\u2019s existence. \u201cIt\u2019s a sweetener for getting rid of the FA Cup replays,\u201d he said. \u201cNinety-five per cent of National League clubs were opposed. And why did they stop replays in the first and second rounds, when they don\u2019t impact Premier League clubs? It was illogical but with this they are saying: \u2018Don\u2019t worry guys, we have found some more money for you.\u2019\u201d It seems clubs such as Wealdstone feel obliged to participate for extra revenue in the absence of potentially lucrative, not to mention life-affirming, FA Cup replays they previously had the chance to earn. Weston-super-Mare\u2019s recent 1-1 draw in 90 minutes at Bristol Rovers would have been one such example, but in the new format, they eventually lost in extra time. All this arguably ignores the fact that football is part of the entertainment industry. What could be termed a glorified training match in front of a handful of fans is obviously a poor substitute for a blood-and-thunder FA Cup tie. Asked for comment on Tuesday, the Premier League pointed to its September announcement. Does the National League Cup deserve its place in an already congested calendar? It depends who you ask. This article was amended on 14 November to reflect the four clubs who declined their National League Cup invitations.",

      "body": "<p>Rupert Everett prefaces his suite of short stories with an account of the showbiz ruse that provides the title, a grim little routine whereby American film producers intoxicate a would-be screenwriter into feeling that a deal has been done, only to then forget them entirely. Will Everett\u2019s readers offer up the English equivalent, murmuring \u201cDarling, you were marvellous\u201d before moving swiftly on? Well, the collection certainly delivers what Everett\u2019s fans will be hoping for: quality time in his inimitable company. But it also delivers much more. Sometimes, it is simply the energy and poise of the prose that arrest one\u2019s attention; often, it is Everett\u2019s combination of studied carnality with an outlandish gift for invention. This is a storyteller unafraid to spike his black comedy with sudden and strongly brewed emotion \u2013 and vice versa.</p> <p>In his frequent interjections, Everett is disarmingly frank about these stories\u2019 origins. In 20 years of making pitches to TV and film producers, only one project of his has ever landed. This was his directorial debut, The Happy Prince, a meditation on Oscar Wilde\u2019s fall from grace which got considerably more of Wilde\u2019s rage and sorrow on to the screen than many more respectable versions (elements of the film are reworked in the second of these stories). But that was back in 2018, and these days, Everett\u2019s phone isn\u2019t ringing. A rainswept encounter with a former Soho contact sparks the idea that he could usefully bring some of his rejected ideas into a new kind of life. The result is intriguing, not least because these vivid little adventures aren\u2019t really short stories at&nbsp;all; they are scenes from unmade films, reimagined as prose.</p> <p>In the course of a career that started&nbsp;at the Glasgow Citizens theatre company and took him via the West End to Hollywood and beyond, Everett has been by turns an actor, a writer and a director. Here, he draws on all those different experiences. Whatever the setting, the dialogue is always sharp and telling. Sometimes the author plays himself; required to transform, he inhabits even the strangest of his fictional alter egos with assurance. The settings are realised with distinctively cinematic flair; they range from the backstreets of Wilde\u2019s Paris to their Aids-era equivalents, from a ruined Anglo-Irish mansion to a heat-becalmed Suez canal. Their genres vary as much as the settings: one piece dishes the dirt on the underbelly of 1980s Hollywood with made-for-TV tastelessness; another documents a failed shipboard romance as the very best kind of costume drama, clear-eyed and memorable. Everett makes especially skilful use of cinema\u2019s easy ability to filter its stories through screens of memory and flashback; only on rereading the collection do you notice that the intensity and colour of the storytelling almost always spring from the fact that everything is being played out in someone\u2019s dreams, or memories or nightmares.</p> <p>This becomes most explicit in the last story, which drops all pretence of transforming its material into short-form prose and is laid out as an actual film script. This piece, fascinatingly, is made out of just one episode\u2019s worth of material intended for a TV series based on Proust\u2019s<em> </em>\u00c0 la Recherche du Temps Perdu. Instead of going for the elegant restraint of Harold Pinter\u2019s version (also unproduced), this filleting and re-ordering of the granddaddy of all flashback narratives is lyrical and violent, unafraid of dwelling on Proust\u2019s lust and cruelty as the dying author ransacks his memories for meaning. Episodes from Proust\u2019s own life are woven into those of his novel, and the&nbsp;final sequences especially restore some&nbsp;much-needed sexual explicitness to this darkest of autofictions.</p> <p>Individually, the stories are exhilarating; together, they add up to an intriguing self-portrait of an artist at work, presenting us with the multiple facets of an undaunted imagination, recut, repolished and ready to shine in the dark.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>The<em> </em>American No by Rupert Everett is published by Abacus (\u00a320).

But that was back in 2018, and these days, Everett\u2019s phone isn\u2019t ringing. A rainswept encounter with a former Soho contact sparks the idea that he could usefully bring some of his rejected ideas into a new kind of life. The result is intriguing, not least because these vivid little adventures aren\u2019t really short stories at all; they are scenes from unmade films, reimagined as prose. In the course of a career that started at the Glasgow Citizens theatre company and took him via the West End to Hollywood and beyond, Everett has been by turns an actor, a writer and a director. Here, he draws on all those different experiences. Whatever the setting, the dialogue is always sharp and telling. Sometimes the author plays himself; required to transform, he inhabits even the strangest of his fictional alter egos with assurance. The settings are realised with distinctively cinematic flair; they range from the backstreets of Wilde\u2019s Paris to their Aids-era equivalents, from a ruined Anglo-Irish mansion to a heat-becalmed Suez canal. Their genres vary as much as the settings: one piece dishes the dirt on the underbelly of 1980s Hollywood with made-for-TV tastelessness; another documents a failed shipboard romance as the very best kind of costume drama, clear-eyed and memorable. Everett makes especially skilful use of cinema\u2019s easy ability to filter its stories through screens of memory and flashback; only on rereading the collection do you notice that the intensity and colour of the storytelling almost always spring from the fact that everything is being played out in someone\u2019s dreams, or memories or nightmares. This becomes most explicit in the last story, which drops all pretence of transforming its material into short-form prose and is laid out as an actual film script. This piece, fascinatingly, is made out of just one episode\u2019s worth of material intended for a TV series based on Proust\u2019s \u00c0 la Recherche du Temps Perdu. Instead of going for the elegant restraint of Harold Pinter\u2019s version (also unproduced), this filleting and re-ordering of the granddaddy of all flashback narratives is lyrical and violent, unafraid of dwelling on Proust\u2019s lust and cruelty as the dying author ransacks his memories for meaning. Episodes from Proust\u2019s own life are woven into those of his novel, and the final sequences especially restore some much-needed sexual explicitness to this darkest of autofictions. Individually, the stories are exhilarating; together, they add up to an intriguing self-portrait of an artist at work, presenting us with the multiple facets of an undaunted imagination, recut, repolished and ready to shine in the dark. \u2022 The American No by Rupert Everett is published by Abacus (\u00a320).

      "body": "<p>About 50 years ago, a man named Hans Bauer who worked in marketing for a German carmaker came up with the slogan <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/vorsprung-durch-technik-advertising-germany\">Vorsprung durch </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/vorsprung-durch-technik-advertising-germany\">Technik</a></em> or \u201cadvantage through technology\u201d. Poetry it wasn\u2019t. The slogan seemed a little clumsy and too heavy on consonants, sounding harsh even to German ears. But it stuck because it captured something that rang true. The Germans had an edge in manufacturing cars and other machines.</p> <p>The company that employed Bauer was Audi, which has used the slogan ever since. For a long time, there seemed to be no need for adjustment. True, whenever the Germans experienced an economic downturn, they asked themselves whether the all-important carmakers had lost their edge. But then some tweaks would be made, and the engine would roar back to life. This time feels different. And that\u2019s not just because of recent bad news, which includes <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/bmw-reports-drop-earnings-related-china-brake-issues-2024-11-06/\">BMW </a>and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/mercedes-benz-lowers-annual-core-profit-forecast-after-china-sales-fall-2024-09-19/\">Mercedes posting profit warnings</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/28/volkswagen-shut-three-factories-cut-thousands-jobs-union\">Volkswagen pondering massive job cuts</a> and, on top of it all, Donald Trump threatening to slap steep tariffs on US imports. It\u2019s because the Germans are now realising they may have lost that special something called <em>Vorsprung</em>.</p> <p>The history of the country\u2019s car industry goes back to <a href=\"https://group.mercedes-benz.com/company/tradition/founders-pioneers/gottlieb-daimler.html\">Gottlieb Daimler</a> and <a href=\"https://group.mercedes-benz.com/company/tradition/founders-pioneers/carl-benz.html\">Carl Benz</a>, inventors whose pioneering work didn\u2019t translate into immediate business success. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, German carmakers were run by engineers who cared more about technology than sales. The production was time-intensive, and there weren\u2019t enough buyers for the expensive and carefully crafted automobiles.</p> <p>For inspiration, the carmakers looked to Detroit where Henry Ford had introduced assembly lines and started mass-producing cars. A man named Adolf Hitler cooked up the idea for a Volkswagen, a \u201cpeople\u2019s car\u201d,<strong> </strong>cheap enough for ordinary Germans to buy. But the idea only came to fruition once Hitler was gone. In the 1950s, Volkswagen combined German engineering prowess with US-style mass production to turn the <a href=\"https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/beetle-3596\">Beetle</a> into a global success. Daimler-Benz, Audi and BMW did the same for the international luxury sector, making cars known for their sleek design and meticulous engineering. It was only then that German auto manufacturing became what it is today \u2013 a key industry directly employing about 800,000 people.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, the industry has become synonymous with the German economy as a whole because it so perfectly encapsulates the nation\u2019s business model. In essence, the carmakers rely on highly skilled and well-paid workers who tend to stay with one company throughout their careers. Codetermination, whereby employees have some say in management decisions, is the norm. Although German companies are competitors, they cooperate in the dual vocational training system that allows for a pool of shared knowledge. More often than not, German car managers have a strong background in engineering, not in sales and marketing.</p> <p>All of the above has been conducive to a distinctive business culture. The Germans favour incremental innovation over radical change, meaning that they focus on optimising existing technology rather than creating something new and disruptive. In the case of the automobile \u2013 once the Germans had introduced cars with internal combustion engines in the late 19th century, they kept refining the details to maintain their engineering edge.</p> <p>However, the sense of superiority that Germans developed over the years has produced some spectacular failures. In the 1980s, Mercedes, then called Daimler-Benz, went on a billion-dollar spree to turn the automaker into a diversified technology group. After that strategy faltered, the company took over the US automaker Chrysler, hoping to forge a truly global player. The subsequent collapse of the merger was blamed on \u201ccultural differences\u201d, a euphemism for German arrogance: the Daimler executives thought they knew better than their US counterparts. Arrogance played a role, too, in the scandal over Volkswagen\u2019s sophisticated but disastrous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/25/vw-emissions-scandal-seven-days\">attempts to hide</a> the illegal emissions levels of its cars.</p> <p>But the real threat to German excellence did not come from within. In the early noughties, when the California-based Elon Musk placed a risky bet on Tesla, traditional automakers were staying away from electric vehicles because they did not want to cannibalise existing business, and the Germans were particularly hesitant. The new technology threatened to obliterate their combustible-engine edge and to endanger German suppliers whose components weren\u2019t needed in electric vehicles (EVs). Tesla, backed by the might of the US financial markets, is now <a href=\"https://companiesmarketcap.com/tesla/marketcap/\">worth over $1tn</a>, about seven times as much as Daimler, Volkswagen and BMW combined.</p> <p>Still worse is the threat from China. In the 1980s, Volkswagen was among the first western companies to open a plant in the People\u2019s Republic. Other Germans followed suit. But there was a snag. In order to conquer the vast market, western companies had to establish joint ventures with fledgling Chinese companies. So the Germans handed over expertise to future competitors. They believed \u2013 arrogantly perhaps \u2013 that they\u2019d manage to maintain their technological lead anyway. And for a long time that worked out well. Until it didn\u2019t.</p> <p>Volkswagen was the first to feel it. While the German carmaker was still heavily invested in traditional technology, Chinese competitors put their (and the government\u2019s) money into electric vehicles, while also benefiting from lower labour rates and advantages in battery technology. As a result, Volkswagen has <a href=\"https://www.carsupermarket.com/blog/get-fully-charged-volkswagen-goes-down-in-china-after-over-a-decade-of-rule\">ceded its position</a> as China\u2019s bestselling brand to BYD, and its market share is shrinking fast. </p> <p>Now the same thing is happening to BMW, Mercedes and Audi. Newfound competitors such as Nio and Xiaomi caught up fast and are producing electric luxury-type cars at much lower prices. The Germans were aghast recently when they saw <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC1YBnP2Av0\">a Chinese video</a> that pitted the Nio ET9 against the Mercedes-Maybach. Both cars took a pyramid of champagne glasses for a bumpy ride. But only the Mercedes spilled the drinks.<strong> </strong></p> <p>In China and some other markets, too, the German carmakers are finding themselves in an unusual position. They have to play catch-up and they don\u2019t like it. Struggling in the EV market, some manufacturers are now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/15/bmw-chief-eu-combustion-engine-ban-car-industry#:~:text=Efforts%20by%20BMW%20to%20push,be%20sold%20after%20this%20date.\">lobbying </a>for the EU to postpone the 2035 deadline for traditional engines. Others are desperately hoping that restrictions on permissible CO2 emissions will be adjusted in their favour. In other words, they are trying to turn back the clock.</p> <p>The car industry is faced with a situation that affects other businesses here too. There\u2019s a widespread sense of nostalgia for the economic miracle of the 1950s and 1960s when corporate Germany went through a period of unprecedented growth.

      "body": "<p>This rather lovely film tells the story of a man called Billy Mail, and his otter \u2013 a pup he rescued after spotting it half-starved on the pontoon bobbing in the Atlantic at the bottom of his garden in Shetland. Billy called the otter Molly, and started feeding it. On the voiceover his wife, Susan, says Molly took over their lives, and she\u2019s not kidding. By the end of the film, Molly is living in a handbuilt miniature bothy in the garden, dining on haddock; we get to feast on Shetland\u2019s epic scenery, beautifully shot by wildlife cameraman and National Geographic photographer Charlie Hamilton James.</p> <p>Otters are apparently extremely shy, so Molly must be desperate, Billy reasoned when he found her in March 2021. He bought a book about otters, which was no help at all trying to raise a pup, so he made it up as he went along. \u201cI felt a bit daft sometimes,\u201d he says over footage of himself filling a tub with brightly coloured plastic balls for Molly to play in. But, like a good mummy otter, his plan was to get Molly to the point where she could go it alone and survive the winter. Susan wonders if the relationship flipped from Billy keeping Molly going to the other way round.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5n2UJ63hA0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W5n2UJ63hA0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The couple both talk briefly about Billy\u2019s grief at not having had children, leaving him with a lasting sense of loss; director Hamilton James is polite in respecting their privacy, and doesn\u2019t prod. There\u2019s a twist coming when a bruiser of a male otter shows up. But really, this is a film of gentle pleasures, watching the couple\u2019s house gradually becoming otter crazy. A novelty mug on the kitchen drainer reads: \u201cYou\u2019re my otter half.\u201d I pitied the couple\u2019s longsuffering dog, frequently filmed nosing a ball forlornly, clearly feeling dejected and ignored.</p> <p>\u2022 Billy &amp; Molly: An Otter Love Story is on Disney+ now and National Geographic from 15 November </p>",

      "bodyText": "This rather lovely film tells the story of a man called Billy Mail, and his otter \u2013 a pup he rescued after spotting it half-starved on the pontoon bobbing in the Atlantic at the bottom of his garden in Shetland. Billy called the otter Molly, and started feeding it. On the voiceover his wife, Susan, says Molly took over their lives, and she\u2019s not kidding. By the end of the film, Molly is living in a handbuilt miniature bothy in the garden, dining on haddock; we get to feast on Shetland\u2019s epic scenery, beautifully shot by wildlife cameraman and National Geographic photographer Charlie Hamilton James. Otters are apparently extremely shy, so Molly must be desperate, Billy reasoned when he found her in March 2021. He bought a book about otters, which was no help at all trying to raise a pup, so he made it up as he went along. \u201cI felt a bit daft sometimes,\u201d he says over footage of himself filling a tub with brightly coloured plastic balls for Molly to play in. But, like a good mummy otter, his plan was to get Molly to the point where she could go it alone and survive the winter. Susan wonders if the relationship flipped from Billy keeping Molly going to the other way round. The couple both talk briefly about Billy\u2019s grief at not having had children, leaving him with a lasting sense of loss; director Hamilton James is polite in respecting their privacy, and doesn\u2019t prod. There\u2019s a twist coming when a bruiser of a male otter shows up. But really, this is a film of gentle pleasures, watching the couple\u2019s house gradually becoming otter crazy. A novelty mug on the kitchen drainer reads: \u201cYou\u2019re my otter half.\u201d I pitied the couple\u2019s longsuffering dog, frequently filmed nosing a ball forlornly, clearly feeling dejected and ignored. \u2022 Billy &amp; Molly: An Otter Love Story is on Disney+ now and National Geographic from 15 November",

The letter also asks the government to update fiduciary duty law, so that acting in savers\u2019 \u201cbest interests\u201d means taking the impacts of climate change and damage to nature into account. Rylance said: \u201cWhen we change, the whole world changes. Divesting from businesses and practices which are not harmonious with life on Earth is, I believe, an essential step for all of us to consider.\u201d \u201cPensions are a powerful driver in society. I do not want this time of enormous challenge for all life on our planet to become a story of force, dictatorship, fear and war. Let us change the story by changing ourselves as a union of artists and choosing life over profit.\u201d Equity\u2019s move marks the culmination of a campaign first launched in 2017 by Attenborough and Mimmack to ensure union members\u2019 savings were aligned to sustainability, which was backed by a number of British film and television stars including David Harewood and Maxine Peake. Equity said an estimated \u00a388bn of UK pension savers\u2019 money was invested in fossil fuel companies \u2013 about \u00a33,000 for each pension holder. It said the union\u2019s new default fund would not invest in companies involved in thermal coal, or those making more than 10% of their revenue from oil and gas. The process of moving artists\u2019 money away from fossil fuels took several years because funds that exclude oil, gas and coal have in the past been considered higher risk, it added. Attenborough and Mimmack said they were \u201cnow looking to our political leaders to back us up\u201d. Equity\u2019s general secretary, Paul W Fleming, said: \u201cEquity\u2019s members have power because they act together as a collective. The climate crisis is a problem built by capitalism, and capitalism alone won\u2019t fix it.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why we need unions like Equity doing all they can to push for change, whether in negotiations with producers over Green Riders, or leveraging our members\u2019 pension investments against fossil fuel extraction. We can push the bosses who made this crisis to play their part in the green Industrial Revolution we need.\u201d",

After a decade of severe underfunding and institutional crises, many question whether measures like league tables are anything more than a sop to those seeking tough action from a newly elected government. But despite institutional resistance, the health secretary is determined to push on.</p> <p>Streeting is drawing inspiration from New Labour in its first term: it also inherited a struggling NHS and turned performance around by the time it left office 13 years later. \u201cHe\u2019s going back to the future with this,\u201d says Denis. Streeting has even appointed Alan Milburn, a former Labour health secretary, as a senior health adviser, seeking to apply lessons from past successes to today\u2019s challenges.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>What would change?</strong></p> <p>The government argues that the carrot-and-stick approach of a league table will drive faster progress in the NHS. Hospital trusts that perform well will be able to reinvest their budget surpluses into modernising buildings, equipment and technology. On the flip side, struggling hospitals can expect tighter monitoring and tougher measures.</p> <p>The government has also introduced a new pay framework for senior managers, designed to \u201cclamp down on poor performance\u201d. Under this plan, those overseeing trusts with major deficits or poor patient services will not be eligible for pay rises. </p> <p>Hospital bosses have described the new plans to Denis as a \u201ccrude\u201d approach to measuring performance, warning that it risks further lowering already fragile morale. The NHS has long struggled with a chronic recruitment and retention crisis, and Dr Adrian Boyle, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, cautioned in a BBC interview that this policy could make the problem even worse. And it\u2019s not just the staff who would be affected \u2013 patients may also feel pressured to seek treatment in higher performing hospitals elsewhere, which could be extremely far from where they live. \u201cThere are so many practical issues,\u201d Denis says.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Why a league table?</strong></p> <p>The government claims that a league table offers a practical way to assess and measure NHS performance across the board. \u201cThe rationale for this isn\u2019t clear,\u201d says Denis, \u201cand I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a solid evidence base for it.\u201d</p> <p>And the idea of a league table is not new. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/sep/25/hospitals.nhs1\">Over two decades ago</a>, a Labour government tried to introduce it but ultimately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/jul/26/health.politics1\">abandoned</a> the idea after a few years. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to see why many in the NHS feel this approach is unnecessary and a bit punitive,\u201d Denis adds. The NHS is already one of the most monitored, regulated and scrutinised health systems in the world. \u201cThere are already multiple regulators and an overwhelming amount of data on NHS performance \u2013 so as patients, taxpayers and voters, the public isn\u2019t exactly lacking information to judge how different parts of the NHS are doing,\u201d Denis points out.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The metrics</strong></p> <p>The Department of Health and Social Care has indicated that the league table will be based on a number of key metrics including patient access to care, waiting times, financial performance (most hospital trusts in England are now significantly over budget) and the quality of leadership. However, it remains unclear whether these disparate data points will be combined into a single ranking.</p> <p>\u201cNHS leaders have also expressed concerns about how this will account for factors beyond hospitals\u2019 control,\u201d Denis says. A hospital\u2019s ability to meet performance targets, for example, is heavily influenced by the availability of local GP services. With many people unable to secure GP appointments, more patients are forced to seek care in A&amp;E, creating additional strain on hospitals.</p> <p>Hospitals where the local population has more health needs than the national average \u2013 usually poorer areas \u2013 face higher demand compared with more affluent areas with generally healthier populations. If the league table does not account for these factors, hospitals serving low-income areas will fare worse, and be penalised, due to challenges outside their control.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Tough on NHS failings, tough on the causes of NHS failings</strong></p> <p>There is also a clear element of political theatre in play. \u201cA big part of Streeting\u2019s speech is about showing the treasury and the rest of government that he\u2019s being tough on the NHS,\u201d says Denis, \u201cthat he\u2019s not just accepting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/02/nhs-226bn-funding-boost-in-england-not-enough-warn-health-experts#:~:text=The%20Observer-,NHS%20%C2%A322.6bn%20funding%20boost%20in,not%20enough'%2C%20warn%20health%20experts&amp;text=Rachel%20Reeves%20last%20week%20announced,the%20Covid%20pandemic%20%E2%80%93%20since%202010.\">\u00a322.6bn increase in day-to-day NHS funding</a> without ensuring the government gets value for its money.</p> <p>\u201cI think we will see more of this tone from Streeting during his tenure as health secretary, where he will be seen to be giving the NHS a bit of a kicking and treating it as if it\u2019s on the naughty steps to justify the money.\u201d</p> <h2>What else we\u2019ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Rising food bills, exacerbated by extreme weather, were a contributing factor to Donald Trump\u2019s win last week.

The government claims that a league table offers a practical way to assess and measure NHS performance across the board. \u201cThe rationale for this isn\u2019t clear,\u201d says Denis, \u201cand I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a solid evidence base for it.\u201d And the idea of a league table is not new. Over two decades ago, a Labour government tried to introduce it but ultimately abandoned the idea after a few years. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to see why many in the NHS feel this approach is unnecessary and a bit punitive,\u201d Denis adds. The NHS is already one of the most monitored, regulated and scrutinised health systems in the world. \u201cThere are already multiple regulators and an overwhelming amount of data on NHS performance \u2013 so as patients, taxpayers and voters, the public isn\u2019t exactly lacking information to judge how different parts of the NHS are doing,\u201d Denis points out. *** The metrics The Department of Health and Social Care has indicated that the league table will be based on a number of key metrics including patient access to care, waiting times, financial performance (most hospital trusts in England are now significantly over budget) and the quality of leadership. However, it remains unclear whether these disparate data points will be combined into a single ranking. \u201cNHS leaders have also expressed concerns about how this will account for factors beyond hospitals\u2019 control,\u201d Denis says. A hospital\u2019s ability to meet performance targets, for example, is heavily influenced by the availability of local GP services. With many people unable to secure GP appointments, more patients are forced to seek care in A&amp;E, creating additional strain on hospitals. Hospitals where the local population has more health needs than the national average \u2013 usually poorer areas \u2013 face higher demand compared with more affluent areas with generally healthier populations. If the league table does not account for these factors, hospitals serving low-income areas will fare worse, and be penalised, due to challenges outside their control. *** Tough on NHS failings, tough on the causes of NHS failings There is also a clear element of political theatre in play. \u201cA big part of Streeting\u2019s speech is about showing the treasury and the rest of government that he\u2019s being tough on the NHS,\u201d says Denis, \u201cthat he\u2019s not just accepting the \u00a322.6bn increase in day-to-day NHS funding without ensuring the government gets value for its money. \u201cI think we will see more of this tone from Streeting during his tenure as health secretary, where he will be seen to be giving the NHS a bit of a kicking and treating it as if it\u2019s on the naughty steps to justify the money.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading Rising food bills, exacerbated by extreme weather, were a contributing factor to Donald Trump\u2019s win last week.

But what if the history of this very basic game was more complicated, and more fascinating, than you knew?

It is an amazing thing, a rare example of a perfect game that despite all the drama outlined in this documentary and all the various version over the years, is still pretty much unchanged after 40 years.\u201d Sign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every Sunday Bored at work?

He replied that in their case it is \u201cinevitable\u201d that they will need to be let out because removal isn\u2019t possible.</p> <p>The solicitor general, <strong>Stephen Donaghue</strong>, submitted that the period where a non-citizen is seeking admission to Australia is distinct from the removal period. The high court\u2019s NZYQ decision applied to removal, but has no application to people seeking admission \u2013 because their application has not been \u201cfinally determined\u201d and the Migration Act creates no power to remove them yet.</p> <p>Donaghue argued detention had legitimate non-punitive purposes, including preventing non-citizens from absconding (as one of the applicants did) so that they can answer questions about their identity, possible criminal record and other matters.</p> <p>Donaghue said that the applicants\u2019 case \u201csounded a lot like\u201d it brought the entire mandatory detention regime into question and that when challenged Hooke could provide no \u201cworkable, stable criteria\u201d for why people with protection findings should be let out but not other non-citizens who bring a habeas application.</p> <p>In reply, Hooke said that a non-citizen who brought an application as soon as they were detained, before the government had established their identity or conducted legitimate inquiries would have a case \u201cgoing nowhere\u201d. \u201cThere are very practical solutions to all the spectres the commonwealth puts against us,\u201d he said.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-14T06:34:22.413Z\">at 6.34am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-67357e758f0839ad951d812d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/benita-kolovos\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-14T05:51:44.871Z\">5.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>VCE exam papers reviewed to ensure questions were different from those published online, official says</strong></p> <p>The Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority (VCAA) chief executive, <strong>Kylie White</strong>, has held a press conference in Melbourne after it was revealed some students were able to access exam answers in cheat sheets ahead of time.</p> <p>White said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Examinations for the VCE this year have not been compromised.

About 1pm today, officers attached to Sydney City Police Area Command responded to reports of a man discharging what was believed to be a replica firearm on Hospital Road, Sydney. The man left the location in a vehicle, prior to police arrival. Acting on information provided, police arrested a male ride share driver in Mascot about 5.10pm today. Police say a water pistol was seized and will be subject to further examination. What we learned, Thursday 14 November We\u2019re going to leave it here for the evening. Here\u2019s what happened today: The Victorian man accused of murdering missing Ballarat woman Samantha Murphy has pleaded not guilty. Patrick Stephenson, 23, appeared in the Ballarat magistrates court via video link, charged with the murder of the mother of three. Murphy, 51, was last seen more than nine months ago when she left her Ballarat East home to go for a run. Australia\u2019s unemployment rate held steady in October with fewer jobs created than expected. The country\u2019s unemployment rate was 4.1% in October, dousing hopes of a near-term interest rate cut. Acting prime minister Richard Marles has backed Australia\u2019s ambassador to the US, former prime minister Kevin Rudd, suggesting he will be staying in the job. Rudd\u2019s past personal criticisms of president-elect Donald Trump have prompted speculation \u2013 including from some in Trump\u2019s inner circle, as well as from Peter Dutton \u2013 about whether he should remain as ambassador under the new US administration. Fire ants have been detected in northern New South Wales after turf delivery from south-east Queensland, the Invasive Species Council has announced.

Thanks for reading and see you back here tomorrow. Court hearing into non-citizens contesting immigration detention The high court has today heard the case of two non-citizens who are seeking to show that detention while the government considers protection visa applications is unlawful. In Thursday\u2019s hearing, David Hooke SC, argued that this was a \u201cvery narrow\u201d extension of the court\u2019s NZYQ decision that indefinite immigration detention is unlawful where removal is not possible, which would only benefit people who have already had protection findings in their favour. Non-citizens awaiting a decision have a \u201cright to liberty\u201d because they will need to be let out whichever way the decision goes, if they are granted a visa or if it is refused (because the NZYQ decision then kicks in and says their detention is unlawful). Hooke was peppered with questions about what the basis was for extending this only to people with protection findings. He replied that in their case it is \u201cinevitable\u201d that they will need to be let out because removal isn\u2019t possible. The solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, submitted that the period where a non-citizen is seeking admission to Australia is distinct from the removal period. The high court\u2019s NZYQ decision applied to removal, but has no application to people seeking admission \u2013 because their application has not been \u201cfinally determined\u201d and the Migration Act creates no power to remove them yet. Donaghue argued detention had legitimate non-punitive purposes, including preventing non-citizens from absconding (as one of the applicants did) so that they can answer questions about their identity, possible criminal record and other matters. Donaghue said that the applicants\u2019 case \u201csounded a lot like\u201d it brought the entire mandatory detention regime into question and that when challenged Hooke could provide no \u201cworkable, stable criteria\u201d for why people with protection findings should be let out but not other non-citizens who bring a habeas application. In reply, Hooke said that a non-citizen who brought an application as soon as they were detained, before the government had established their identity or conducted legitimate inquiries would have a case \u201cgoing nowhere\u201d. \u201cThere are very practical solutions to all the spectres the commonwealth puts against us,\u201d he said. VCE exam papers reviewed to ensure questions were different from those published online, official says The Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority (VCAA) chief executive, Kylie White, has held a press conference in Melbourne after it was revealed some students were able to access exam answers in cheat sheets ahead of time. White said: Examinations for the VCE this year have not been compromised. All exams have been prepared with comprehensive quality assurance. This was a production issue where sample material was inadvertently included in the published sample \u2026 The VCAA discovered this issue before the written VCE examinations commenced. We reviewed the examinations to ensure the questions were different. White said the exams would be \u201csimilar\u201d to the practice material because they were based on the VCE study design, which has remained the same for several years. She said: If students have seen the sample material before sitting the examination, this will not advantage a student\u2019s ability to respond to the questions as they were different. I acknowledge, though, that students may be feeling some concern, but I would like to say to all students that they can feel confident about completing their examinations and there will be no adverse impacts to their results. The answers were published by VCAA online for eight exams, including three that have already been sat. They were on the cover page of the practice exams, which to the eye looked blank. But when the pages were pasted into a Word document, it revealed a series of questions and answers. The National Anti-Corruption Commission\u2019s Inspector \u2013 AKA the watchdog\u2019s watchdog \u2013 has released its first annual report, revealing some of the federal integrity body\u2019s teething issues. Tabled on Thursday, the inspector, Gail Furness SC, revealed it had received more than 1,300 complaints in its inaugural year to the end of June with 1,164 related to the Nacc\u2019s decision not to investigate six robodebt referrals. The other non-robodebt complaints highlighted some of the new anti-corruption body\u2019s growing pains. In one example highlighted by the inspector, the Nacc declined to investigate a complaint made in January 2024 after it could not identify a corruption issue. The inspector assessed the complaint independently and identified two corruption issues. Upon reassessment, the Nacc identified the corruption issues, \u201calbeit on a slightly different basis\u201d. The inspector said there were \u201csystemic issues arising from the inadequate and flawed handling of the referral by the commission\u201d. It added the Nacc commissioner, Paul Brereton, did not take issue with that characterisation. The inspector\u2019s assessment identified the Nacc needed a more accurate case management system, a pathway for more complex referrals, that letters to complainants must be signed and for better training for the Nacc\u2019s intake and triage officers. Brereton agreed with the inspector\u2019s observations. The inspector said it didn\u2019t believe the Nacc\u2019s handling of the complaint amounted to agency maladministration. Almost one in 10 Victorians facing \u2018severe\u2019 food insecurity, parliamentary inquiry finds A parliamentary inquiry has found almost one in 10 Victorians are struggling with \u201csevere\u201d food insecurity. The upper house\u2019s legal and social issues committee says the figure could even be higher, with low\u2011income earners, Aboriginal people and young Victorians most disadvantaged amid the cost of living crisis. Committee chair, Liberal MP Trung Luu, said most responsibility for the crisis lies with the federal government: This includes how corporations and competition are regulated as well as the levels of income support provided by JobSeeker and the age pension. Accordingly, the committee has recommended the Victorian government advocate for an increase in Federal income support, to try and break the link between poverty and food insecurity. However, the state government also had the power to act. Among the committee\u2019s 25 recommendations is a trial of a comprehensive, universal school meal program in areas of disadvantage, which would provide food throughout the day for students. It also recommended an expansion of its schools breakfast program to all schools on an opt-in basis. NAB pushes back forecast for first RBA rate cut after jobs data As we noted in our report on the labour market earlier today, the October figures pointed to \u201ctight\u201d conditions, dousing hopes of a near-term interest rate cut. To be sure, those hopes would have been slim before the numbers landed. When they did, there was little to give cause for the Reserve Bank to start considering an interest rate cut. Well, NAB, one of the big four banks, seems to agree. It had pencilled in the first RBA rate cut for February (i.e. the meeting after next), and now expects it won\u2019t come until May. \u201cWe also note that there is a real risk that policy rates stay on hold even deeper into 2025 should the labour market remain tight and services inflation remain elevated,\u201d the bank said. National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) members will rally at the Australian National University (ANU) today in opposition to a request from management to give up their December pay rise. ANU will put a vote to staff on Monday to relinquish the scheduled 2.5% rise, less than a year into the life of the enterprise agreement. Division secretary of the NTEU\u2019s ANU branch, Dr Lachlan Clohesy, said ANU\u2019s financial issues had been brought about by \u201cfinancial mismanagement, poor governance, and as they admitted to Senate Estimates - \u2018erroneous\u2019 budgeting\u201d. ANU staff should not have to pay the price of management\u2019s mistakes. The university has taken a hard hit from the government\u2019s proposed international student cap, with its yearly allocation to be slashed by 14%. A spokesperson for ANU said it had been in an operating deficit for several years and was working to reduce total costs by $250m, adding that foregoing the pay increase would only go ahead if approved by a majority. Forgoing the upcoming 2.5% salary increase \u2026 would save up to $15m, with every dollar saved from the bottom line helping us to retain jobs. This change proposal has not been taken lightly, but these are changes we have to make. Without structural intervention, the University will not be financially sustainable. And with that, I leave the blog with Kate Lyons. Thanks for reading. The Law Council of Australia has come out swinging against the federal government\u2019s proposed changes to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws, saying they will force lawyers to become \u201ccovert informers\u201d and small law firms could close their doors. A Labor-chaired committee delivered its report on Wednesday, recommending the regime be expanded to extend reporting obligations about suspicious transactions to lawyers as well as accountants and real estate agents. However, Coalition members of the committee said they couldn\u2019t support the bill in its current form, pointing to higher cost burdens for small businesses. Australia remains one of the few jurisdictions in the world not to force those working in client services to report suspicions to a financial intelligence agency. In 2015, the global financial watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force, found that Australia was at risk of being \u201cgreylisted\u201d \u2013 a move that puts a country under increased scrutiny and monitoring \u2013 alongside countries such as Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo and Mali. But the Law Council has warned the changes could impact those in the profession by limiting a \u201cperson\u2019s ability to trust and confide in their lawyer\u201d. In a statement on Thursday, the council said: Under this bill, lawyers will be forced to become covert informers on their clients. This undermines the vital, fundamental and long accepted right for Australians to be able to consult their lawyer in privacy. Insufficient thought has been given to the impact of the bill on the criminal justice system. The Law Council said it believes the \u201ccosts and red tape\u201d associated will increase fees at small law firms or cause them to close up shop. It added Australian law firms do not impose a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d. According to a recent impact analysis, the government\u2019s preferred option is expected to cost businesses $13.9bn over 10 years and would simplify the laws while including the new reporting obligations. It estimated the flow-on customer burden was around $209m over the decade. People subject to visa cancellation in prison \u2018pipelined\u2019 to detention and deportation: HRLC The Human Rights Law Centre is calling for the repeal of mandatory visa cancellation provisions in a new report that finds people subject to visa cancellation in prison are \u201cpipelined\u201d to detention and deportation. Cancellations on \u201ccharacter\u201d grounds have \u201cincreased more than tenfold\u201d since 2014, when mandatory character-based visa cancellation powers were introduced in an amendment to the Migration Act, the report says. Any visa held by a non-citizen could be mandatorily cancelled if the visa-holder was serving a full-time sentence of imprisonment and if they failed the \u2018character test\u2019 \u2013 most commonly on the grounds they had been sentenced to serve a prison term of 12 or more months. Visa cancellations jumped from 76 in 2013/14 to 579 the following year, according to the report. There were more than 900 visa cancellations a year from 2015/2016 to 2020/2021. The report says: Because Australian law requires the detention of people who do not hold a valid visa, the increase in character-based visa cancellations has led directly to a growth in the number of people held in immigration detention for this reason. People subject to character-based cancellation are often held in detention for prolonged periods, sometimes indefinitely, while they attempt to have their visa reinstated. While Australian citizens are granted liberty after serving a sentence, people who are subject to visa cancellation are \u2018pipelined\u2019 from prison to immigration detention and deportation from Australia. The report also finds visa-holders face discriminatory treatment in prison \u201cwith limited access to parole, rehabilitation, and education hindering their ability to have their visas reinstated\u201d. Answers were found on cover page of practice exams published by VCAA The answers were published by VCAA online for some eight exams, including three that have already been sat. They were on the cover page of the practice exams, which to the eye looked blank. But when the pages were pasted into a Word document, it revealed a series of questions and answers. White said it was not known how this occurred but suggested it may be due to using similar formatting to the actual exams. The sample covers normally do not have sample material, though, sample material is often used in the way we format exams. That sample material was inadvertently included and it shouldn\u2019t have been there. As I mentioned, the sample covers are really just for familiarising students for what their exams will look like. VCEs \u2018have not been compromised\u2019, official says after some students able to access answers ahead of time The Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority (VCAA) chief executive, Kylie White, has held a press conference in Melbourne after it was revealed some students were able to access exam answers in cheat sheets ahead of time. She said: Examinations for the VCE this year have not been compromised. All exams have been prepared with comprehensive quality assurance. This was a production issue where sample material was inadvertently included in the published sample \u2026 The VCAA discovered this issue before the written VCE examinations commenced. We reviewed the examinations to ensure the questions were different. White said the exams would be \u201csimilar\u201d to the practice material because they were based on the VCE study design, which has remained the same for several years. She said; If students have seen the sample material before sitting the examination, this will not advantage a student\u2019s ability to respond to the questions as they were different. I acknowledge, though, that students may be feeling some concern, but I would like to say to all students that they can feel confident about completing their examinations and there will be no adverse impacts to their results. An investigation is under way after reports a man was seen discharging a replica firearm in the Sydney CBD. About 1pm, officers attached to Sydney City Police Area Command responded to reports of a man discharging what is believed to be a replica firearm on Hospital Road, Sydney, near the NSW parliament. Initial inquiries suggest the replica firearm, may be a gel blaster, which was discharged several times into the ground. The man left the location in a vehicle, prior to police arrival. No reports of injuries have been reported. A crime scene has been established. The investigation is ongoing. Police have urged anyone with information in relation to the incident to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. Climate change minister hails instalment of solar panels on 4m Australian homes The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has held a media event in Sydney to mark a moment in the renewable energy transition: that solar panels have now been installed on 4m homes across Australia. It means roughly one in three Australian homes have rooftop solar. Bowen said the average home with panels saved more than $1,500 a year on power bills. Aussie homeowners know rooftop solar is a no-brainer when it comes to bringing down bills, which is why we have been installing about 300,000 rooftop systems a year and there is no sign of that slowing down. We have looked at the globe-leading success of Australian household solar, and what we might learn from it, before. For example, see this piece: Marles throws support behind Kevin Rudd amid speculation over ambassador role The acting prime minister Richard Marles has backed Australia\u2019s ambassador to the US, former prime minister Kevin Rudd, suggesting he will be staying in the job. Marles said on Thursday that Rudd had been doing a great job representing Australia and its interests in the United States. In that role, he has been working across the political spectrum, again, with Democrats, Republicans, Trump Republicans, and Kevin was really central to seeing the legislation passed through the Congress this time last year. He worked really closely with members of Congress right across the political spectrum, and I\u2019ve got no doubt that Kevin will ably represent Australia when we see the swearing in of the next Trump administration. Earlier, the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, sharpened his rhetoric about Rudd, saying Australia needs a \u201cfunctioning, stable relationship\u201d with the US, based on \u201cmutual respect\u201d and that it was important Australia\u2019s ambassador could work well with the host government. I guess the difficulty that the prime minister\u2019s in at the moment is that if he sacks Kevin Rudd, then what does he do with Penny Wong? And if he sacks Penny Wong, what does he do given he\u2019s made his own disparaging remarks about president-elect Trump as well? Look, these are issues for the prime minister. Rudd\u2019s past personal criticisms of president-elect Donald Trump, which have prompted speculation \u2013 including from some in Trump\u2019s inner circle \u2013 about whether he should remain as ambassador under the new US administration. Dutton said any difficulties Albanese now faced over his \u201ccaptain\u2019s call\u201d in appointing Rudd were \u201call of his own making\u201d. Access system fault after 3G shutdown to blame for locking firefighters out of stations Fire Rescue Victoria (FRV) has blamed a fault with an access system during the upgrade from 3G for firefighters being unable to unlock gates since the 3G network was shut down at the start of this month. The United Firefighters Union said on Thursday firefighters were locked out of stations due to the phone system used by firefighters going offline after the 3G network shutdown. United Firefighters Union secretary Peter Marshall said FRV had more than a year to prepare and it was \u201csimply bewildering\u201d there was an issue: With the fire service spread ever thinner, firefighters and trucks are being moved between stations more often to fill larger gaps. A spokesperson for Fire Rescue Victoria said when a property can\u2019t be accessed through regular means, personnel know to contact their officer in charge so that access can be gained through alternative means. The spokesperson said FRV was aware of the 3G shutdown, but the issue came in the transition to 4G and 5G: During the transition, a fault with a station access system occurred. Interim measures were quickly implemented, and all staff can now gain access to fire stations. We expect the issue to be fully resolved in the coming days. The 3G shutdown did not remove FRV\u2019s ability to track its vehicles. The Kyle &amp; Jackie O Show has slipped further in the ratings in Melbourne, continuing its downward slide since expanding to the Victorian capital, according to the latest survey figures. The show, hosted by the \u201cking and queen of commercial radio\u201d, Kyle Sandilands and Jackie \u201cO\u201d Henderson, had just 5.1% of the breakfast market in Melbourne, down from 5.2% last survey and eighth in the rankings. The Kyle &amp; Jackie Show has lost nearly 150,000 listeners in Melbourne since its launch at the end of April, compared with ratings last year under the previous breakfast hosts on KiisFM. It is a different story in Sydney, however, where the show was still the leader in the breakfast slot, in this ratings period with 13.1% of the audience. The show has won the FM breakfast slot in the Sydney ratings survey for the past 47 survey periods. However, its share of listeners slipped in Sydney as well, down from 13.7 to 13.1% (39,000 listeners) in this ratings period. Victoria\u2019s health services post $1bn loss Victoria\u2019s health services have posted a combined loss of $1bn for the 2023/24 financial year. Out of the 68 annual reports tabled in parliament on Thursday, 52 health services recorded deficits including Austin Health, Eastern Health, Monash Health and Northern Health. However, the health minister, Mary-Anne Thomas, says the reports do not take into account $1.5bn of additional funding she announced in August, or $8.8bn in the budget. She told reporters at parliament: I\u2019m really confident that with the reforms that we\u2019ve implemented, with the record funding that we\u2019ve delivered, and with the processes that we\u2019ve now got in place, that we will see much better financial management within our health service system. NDIS provider JewishCare NSW has warned clients their personal information, including credit card details, ID documents, court documents and health information could be posted to the dark web after the organisation suffered a cyber-attack last week. The organisation posted on its website that it became aware that it had \u201cexperienced a cyber incident affecting its systems and data\u201d on 28 October: Since becoming aware of the incident, JewishCare has been working tirelessly with our cyber experts and partners to investigate the incident, identify what information has been impacted, and to ensure we can continue providing essential frontline services to our many clients, while protecting the security of the information we hold. We have also been engaging with federal and state government authorities, including the Australian Cyber Security Centre, the Australian federal police, NSW police, the National Office of Cyber Security, and the office of the Australian information commissioner. Our priority has been to try to minimise the impact on our clients, our donors and other stakeholders and our people, and to remediate and restore our systems for safe use. The organisation has said it has informed those affected. JewishCare NSW did not respond to requests for comment on the number of people affected but said it did not have evidence at this time that it was a targeted attack on the Jewish community: At this stage there is nothing to suggest this is a targeted attack on the Jewish community but we are continuing to engage with relevant agencies and law enforcement in connection with this matter. Fire ants have been detected in northern New South Wales after turf delivery from south-east Queensland, the Invasive Species Council has announced. The latest detection raises concerns around the growing build up of fire ants within suppression zones, with the ant one of the world\u2019s worst super pests. Left unchecked, they will spread and bring with them economic damage greater than that caused by cane toads, rabbits, feral cats, and foxes combined. The Invasive Species Council advocacy manager, Reece Pianta, said what is currently happening is \u201ca recipe for a national fire ant disaster.\u201d We call on the state government to urgently conduct a suppression and compliance blitz to prevent the spread of these tiny killers. I\u2019ve been to fields with hundreds of fire ant nests less than 50 metres from turf farm production areas. This is a recipe for a national fire ant disaster. To eradicate fire ants we can\u2019t kill most of them, we must systematically treat 100% of the land in the infestation zone. If fire ants spread to other parts of Australia it will undermine eradication efforts and put humans and animals at risk. This is a stark reminder to the Queensland LNP government: strengthening the fire ant eradication program must be a first 100 day priority. An immediate boost in 2025 can get eradication on track and long term eradication funding after the 2027 expiry date can get the job done. A 32 year old woman has died after being hit by a four wheel drive near Goulburn this morning. Emergency services were called to the Hume Highway, near Sydney Road, Boxers Creek at around 4am this morning following reports a pedestrian had been hit by a car. Officers attached to The Hume Police District attended the scene and were told a woman had been on the road when she was hit by a four wheel drive travelling in a northbound lane. NSW Ambulance paramedics treated the 32-year-old at the scene, before she was taken to Goulburn Base Hospital where she later died. The 63 year old male driver has been taken to hospital for mandatory testing. Police have established a crime scene, and are investigating the incident. A report will be prepared for the information of the Coroner. No charges have been laid over the incident. Virgin, Qantas and Jetstar restart flights to Denpasar Virgin, Qantas and Jetstar have resumed normal flights to Denpasar, after delays and cancellations after due to ash clouds from Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki\u2019s eruption. Flights in and out of Denpasar were largely cancelled yesterday, but a Qantas Group spokesperson has confirmed things have returned to normal: In good news, conditions this morning have improved allowing us to resume operations from today between Australia and Denpasar on both Jetstar and Qantas. We will continue to monitor the changing conditions and volcanic activity and work on plans to operate more recovery flights using aircraft from across the group so that we can get customers on their way as quickly as possible. This is an evolving situation and we recommend customers to check their flight status at Jetstar.com and Qantas.com before coming to the airport. Six return Jetstar flights will leave today to Denpasar from a number of ports around Australia, which includes four scheduled services and two ad-hoc recovery flights. Qantas will operate three flights from Australia today including two delayed flights from yesterday (Melbourne and Sydney) and today\u2019s scheduled flight from Sydney. Two of the flights will leave Denpasar tonight and the other on Friday morning local time. Full story here: ACT has lowest unemployment rate in Australia A bit more on the jobs data that just landed. Bragging rights for the lowest unemployment rate in the land again went to the ACT, with 3.1% \u2013 a full percentage point below the national average. It was also down from 3.4% in September. At the other end of the scale was thethe Northern Territory with an October jobless rate now at 4.6%, up from 4.2% in the previous month. New South Wales and Victoria, which together account for about half the economy (and jobs), both saw the jobless rate tick a bit higher to 4% and 4.5%, respectively. Queensland, which held state elections last month, saw its unemployment rate ease to 3.9% from 4.1% in September. Western Australia went the other way, with a notable jump to 4% from 3.6%. (They have elections next March.) South Australia was also performing a bit better, with the jobless rate also easing 0.1 percentage points to 4.2%. Tasmania, in case you\u2019re wondering, was bang on the national average at 4.1% (up 0.1pp). The labour market basically moved sideways last month. A small drop in the participation rate from a record 67.2% in September to 67.1% in October helped to explain why the unemployment rate didn\u2019t budge from 4.1%. Investors took a similar view with the Australian dollar little changed in the immediate aftermath, at just under US65c. Stocks, meanwhile, held on to most of their gains for the day. As mentioned earlier, investors weren\u2019t expecting a Reserve Bank interest rate cut until mid-2025 (or even a bit later), and today\u2019s employment numbers probably won\u2019t shift that view much. Australia\u2019s unemployment rate held steady in October with fewer jobs created than expected. The country\u2019s unemployment rate was 4.1% in October with employers adding about 16,000 new jobs for the month. The result was close to what economists had expected, although the new jobs numbers lagged the forecasts of a net 25,000 gain. Man charged over alleged \u2018pink cocaine\u2019 importation plot A 21-year-old man has been charged for his alleged involvement in a plot to import 252kg of \u201cpink cocaine.\u201d The substance, also named \u201ctusi\u201d, is a drug cocktail and contains a mixture of ketamine, MDMA and other adulterants, and rarely contains any cocaine. The Australian federal police will allege that the man was attempting to import the drug into Australia via international air cargo. The AFP began an investigation in October 2024 into a transnational drug-trafficking syndicate targeting Australia after 252kg of \u201cpink cocaine\u201d was seized in an air cargo consignment \u2013 labelled as containing an industrial saw \u2013 destined for Castle Hill, NSW. The AFP undertook a controlled delivery operation and on 6 November 2024, the consignment was delivered to the Castle Hill address and allegedly accessed by the 21-year-old. He was arrested by AFP investigators in Coogee a short time later and was subsequently charged with attempting to possess a commercial quantity of an unlawfully imported border controlled drug, contrary to sections 307.5 and 11.1 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment. He appeared before Downing Centre local court on Thursday 7 November 2024, where he was formally refused bail. He is expected to next return to court on 29 January 2025. Lawyers\u2019 groups are lobbying for urgent reforms to help abuse survivors in the wake of a landmark high court decision limiting the liability of the Catholic church to compensation claims. The high court on Wednesday delivered a ruling that the Ballarat diocese was not vicariously liable for the actions of an assistant priest because he was not directly employed by the church. That overturned a Victorian court of appeal decision that found the diocese was liable because the priest, despite not being a formal church employee, was a \u201cservant of the church\u201d whose position gave him access and power over children. The high court decision has sparked fears that institutions, including church and non-church bodies, will be able to evade vicarious liability for abuse by individuals within their ranks. The Australian Lawyers Alliance described the decision as a \u201csignificant and unexpected setback for survivors\u201d. Michelle James, national president of the ALA, said: We are very concerned that as a result of this ruling, it is likely that other organisations where child sexual abuse has occurred will similarly avoid vicarious liability for abuse committed by non-employed members, such as clergy, Scout leaders, and sports coaches. We are disappointed to see that the Catholic Church in Australia once again escapes liability due to legal technicalities, mirroring the practical outcome in the Ellis case, and concerned that this will have broader implications for other survivors of child sexual abuse. \u2018Not jumping at shadows\u2019: RBA\u2019s Bullock says it\u2019s too early to gauge Trump impacts A range of senior officials have been addressing Asic\u2019s annual forum in Sydney this morning with Donald Trump\u2019s election as US president high on the list of talking points. The Reserve Bank governor, Michele Bullock, told the audience that it was too early to tell what the impacts would be for Australia, interest rates and so on. (The Trump administration II doesn\u2019t take office until 20 January after all.) \u201cWe don\u2019t actually know what will happen,\u201d Bullock said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be jumping at shadows\u201d, adding the RBA can\u2019t set policy now based on \u201cwhat we think he might do\u201d. So far, though, there was \u201cnot much action\u201d in the bond markets that might portend \u201cdramatic things in the US\u201d. \u201cThey were pretty well-behaved,\u201d she said. Still, there would be more US debt out there (which would nudge global borrowing costs higher, all else equal), and there\u2019s the looming threat of tariffs particularly aimed at China (if Trump\u2019s comments were to be taken on face value). \u201cUltimately if it\u2019s not good for the Chinese economy it\u2019s not good for us either,\u201d Bullock said. (China is by far Australia\u2019s biggest export market, taking more than a third of our shipments/services that we sell abroad.) As for Australia\u2019s interest rates, Bullock said \u201cwe\u2019re going to stay restrictive enough\u201d until the RBA is confident that inflation will \u201csustainably\u201d return to its 2%-3% target band. (She\u2019s said that previously.) The NSW housing minister, Rose Jackson, has attempted to explain an interview she gave yesterday where she claimed Sydneysiders could rent two-bedroom apartments in Sydney for \u201ca couple of hundred bucks\u201d. Jackson was speaking to Hamish Macdonald on ABC Radio yesterday when she made the claim, after being asked what she thinks is a reasonable price to pay in rent in Sydney. She was asked where rentals at that price were located, and responded: \u201cI don\u2019t know, there are places in Sydney you can\u201d. She later accused Macdonald of \u201cputting words in my mouth\u201d and acknowledged Sydney was an expensive place to live. ABC reports the Tenants\u2019 Union of NSW identified 25 rental properties in Sydney for this price or less. This morning, Jackson took to Instagram, where she claimed (among many things) that the answer was taken out of context, that she gave a \u201cgarbled\u201d response because it was live radio, and then denied saying rent in Sydney could be $200. I did a live radio interview in which I was asked \u2018what\u2019s the reasonable rent someone should pay in Sydney?\u2019 not \u2018what are people in Sydney actually truly paying?\u2019 And in the course of a admittedly somewhat garbled answer, talking about different types of apartments and where they\u2019re located in Sydney and all of that, I said a couple of hundred bucks a week. I know that that\u2019s not what people are actually paying in rent in Sydney, but that wasn\u2019t the question that was asked. And live radio is a hard format. You\u2019re on the phone, you can\u2019t see the other person. Sometimes you get a bit garbled. Sometimes your words get a bit mangled. I mean, you know, you\u2019re only kind of human, and I can be a pretty intense person whose words don\u2019t always come out nice and succinct. But obviously I know that rent in Sydney is hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands of dollars. That\u2019s why I talk about the housing crisis all the time. I wouldn\u2019t do that if I thought that rent was affordable. The Victorian man accused of murdering missing Ballarat woman Samantha Murphy has pleaded not guilty to the offence, a court has heard. Patrick Stephenson, 23, has appeared in the Ballarat magistrates court via video link, charged with the murder of the mother of three. Murphy, 51, was last seen more than nine months ago when she left her Ballarat East home to go for a run Stephenson\u2019s defence team has told the court their client has opted to waive committal proceedings and have his case fast-tracked to the Victorian supreme court. Stephenson will appear for a directions hearing in the supreme court on 27 November. Mark Butler says Australia choosing ambassador an \u2018important principle\u2019 I just wanted to return to health minister Mark Butler\u2019s appearance on RN Breakfast earlier this morning, where he backed Kevin Rudd to continue as Australia\u2019s ambassador to the United States. Rudd has a history of being critical of Trump, and his appointment has come under scrutiny after Dan Scavino, a senior adviser to Trump, reposted Rudd\u2019s congratulatory statement to the president-elect on social media with a gif of an hourglass. But Butler said Rudd was a \u201cserious ambassador\u201d and that it was an \u201cimportant principle\u201d that Australia picks who its ambassador is: It\u2019s a pretty important principle that Australia chooses who its ambassador is, the US and chooses who their ambassador are. Every other country does that. The point I think I\u2019ve tried to make, and many others on both sides of politics here in Australia have made, is that Kevin Rudd is a very serious ambassador. I mean, he\u2019s a former prime minister, is regarded around the world, including in the US, across political divides, as a very serious world authority on our region, the Asia Pacific, and, in particular, on China and the Chinese president. And he\u2019s done a whole lot of really important work for our country over the last little while, particularly in relation to Aukus, and he\u2019s done that work across the political aisle, both with Republicans and Democrats. So we\u2019re very convinced that Kevin is the right person for this job. It\u2019s obviously going to be a job of work, because there\u2019s a change of administration that\u2019s going to be a big job for every ambassador who is posted to Washington. But you know, at the end of the day, we choose who our ambassador is, as every country does \u2026 There\u2019s a lot of confidence that having someone of Kevin\u2019s work ethic, intellect and experience in Washington at this time is good for our country. Victorian premier says stronger anti-vilification protections to be introduced to parliament next week With just four sittings days left of the year, Allan confirmed the government will be introducing to parliament next week stronger anti-vilification protections but would not say whether rental reforms would go ahead as promised. She said: We\u2019ll provide further information on our legislative program for the next sitting week but I can say that we will be bringing the anti-vilification legislation to the parliament next sitting week. There\u2019s been a huge amount of work to bring it to this point ... We are seeing, particularly over the past year, that there are some who want to pull at that thread who want to fray our strong, socially cohesive state. For some, it\u2019s for their own political benefit. For others, they\u2019re driven by hate, and we have to absolutely look at ways that we can strengthen the laws, strengthen the powers [and send the message that] there is no place for this sort of hateful behavior in our community. People should have the right to practise their faith, to pray to their God, to have their identity, to love who they want to love. That\u2019s what makes us a great place now and we want to look at making sure that we can strengthen that into the future and send a very, very clear message to those who want to drive hate \u2026 there\u2019s no place for that here in Victoria. Jacinta Allan says community safety won\u2019t be affected by police walkout Allan is also asked about police officers who are striking for the first time in more than 20 years, demanding better pay and working conditions. The strike will see officers stop work at the police academy in Glen Waverley and Broadmeadows police station for 30 minutes. She says she supports Victoria police and had been negotiating their pay deal in good faith: Victoria police do deserve a pay rise. And on the back of that belief and the negotiations that were done with the Police Association, we had reached an agreement. The government reached an agreement with the Police Association to provide Victoria police with a pay rise. We reached that agreement some months ago. We are now in the situation where the matter is before the Fair Work Commission and so taken there by the leadership of Victoria police, and as part of that process we need to wait for the next set of advice to come from the Fair Work Commission. The action comes just two months after police rejected the government\u2019s offer, which offered a 3% pay rise and a nine-day fortnight. Allan said she had been assured community safety would not be affected by the walkout. Victorian premier says VE students reportedly accessing cheat sheets \u2018disappointing\u2019 At her press conference this morning, Jacinta Allan was also asked about a report in the Herald Sun, which said thousands of VCE students were able to access cheat sheets containing almost identical questions and case studies to those in their final exams. The cheat sheets were for eight subjects, including business management, specialist maths and legal studies, which have already been sat. It comes after the government was forced to conduct a review into errors in last year\u2019s exams, which included five mistakes in maths tests and one in chemistry. Asked how this could happen after the review, the premier replied: \u201cThat\u2019s a really fair question, and they\u2019re the questions that the deputy premier and the minister for education, [Ben Carroll], is asking right now. He\u2019s being briefed right now, and he\u2019ll have more to say off the back of that briefing.\u201d Allan said it was incredibly disappointing: It is disappointing, particularly anyone who knows a year 12 or a VCE student, they might have one in their family, they just know how hard those young people work \u2026 to get to this point of the school year to sit their exams. So this is really frustrating for those parents and teachers and students and young people, and that is why the deputy premier is getting advice this morning and will provide further information off the back of that advice. The Victorian minister for women, Natalie Hutchins, gave a demonstration of the vending machines, which distribute either a pad or six tampons at a time. She says once the program is rolled out there will be four machines in every local government area across the state: They\u2019ll be in public areas, like train stations, libraries, swim centres. We really did a lot of consultation with local government, and they got to nominate spots within their LGA. And if we could make it happen, we have. Jobs data will provide fresh insights into strength of Australia\u2019s economy The first of the important October stats land today even before the full September quarter ones are in (eg GDP) with labour market figures out from the ABS. The jobs story is reliably tricky. It\u2019s possible the economy can shed jobs but if the participation rate also drops (from record levels), we can get a lower unemployment rate. And, unlike inflation, prior months can be revised so the previous month\u2019s jobless rate can suddenly be lowered or raised. (Since a lot of payments hang off CPI, it would be tough to revise and either give out more money or try to claw some back.) Anyway, the labour market has been surprisingly strong really since the Covid lockdowns. Most months have seen jobs added even as the labour force has swollen, leaving the jobless rate not that far above the lows seen in the mid-70s. Today might be more of the same, with economists expecting employers added 25,000 net jobs last month, enough to keep the unemployment rate at 4.1%. Still, this is a dataset that can surprise and we\u2019re probably due for a worse-than-expected month (given the forecasting errors have generally been the other way). Stay tuned here at 11.30am Aedt for when they drop. Cbus to be questioned by Senate committee The industry super giant Cbus will today face a Senate grilling, just days after the corporate watchdog announced court action over lengthy delays in paying death and disability benefits. On Tuesday, the deputy chair of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, Sarah Court, said delays in processing claims from grieving families were causing \u201creal harm to families who may be relying on the payments to meet critical expenses\u201d: This adds to difficult personal circumstances, whether grieving for a loved one or dealing with severe injury or illness. The additional anxiety and pain these delays caused compounded the issues these members and their families faced. According to Asic, more than 6,000 Cbus members and claimants had to wait more than 12 months for their payments. The watchdog alleges more than 10,000 members and claimants waited more than 90 days for their death benefits and disability insurance claims to be processed. Here\u2019s Court: We allege they are yet to completely rectify these issues. Earlier this week, Cbus apologised for the delays and said it had established a compensation program for affected members: Cbus Super is sorry that delays have been experienced in the processing of insurance claims made by our members. Regrettably this has added to the distress of members and their families. We apologise to our affected members and their families without reservation and promise to do better. The fund\u2019s chief executive, Kristian Fok, is due to appear before the economics reference committee at 10.30am. Dutton delays decision on tax cuts Dutton was speaking to reporters in Melbourne earlier and he also addressed comments he made yesterday, where he distanced himself from the Coalition\u2019s pledge to reinstate further tax cuts for high-income earners. Dutton this morning essentially delayed making a decision on the tax cuts, saying his highest priority is bringing down inflation: The Liberal party will always be the party of lower taxes and lower interest rates because we manage the economy more efficiently. I think that\u2019s a really important point to make. Next point is that we have a look at the numbers in a pre-budget context and decide what it is we can afford for our country. Because the highest priority at the moment is to bring down inflation. We\u2019ll see how much money is in the bank. I want to make sure we provide our policies in a responsible way. The most irresponsible thing would be to go out and promise billions and billions of dollars\u2019 worth of spending, whether it\u2019s on tax cuts or something else, if it\u2019s going to be inflationary, therefore counterproductive. Dutton says Rudd\u2019s ambassador role a \u2018mess\u2019 Albanese has to deal with The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has waded into the discussions around Kevin Rudd\u2019s role as ambassador to the US, saying this was a \u201cmess\u201d the prime minister has to \u201cdeal with.\u201d Dutton said the government was in a \u201cdifficult position\u201d on Rudd\u2019s role, considering previous criticisms he has made of the incoming US president, Donald Trump: The government\u2019s in a difficult position. The prime minister\u2019s made a number of captain\u2019s calls, and they\u2019ve been at odds with the advice that he\u2019s received from his closest advisers and colleagues. And I suppose that\u2019s a question about the prime minister\u2019s judgment. The prime minister\u2019s got a lot of messes to deal with at the moment, all of his own making. I want what is best for our country. I want us to have a functioning, stable relationship with our most important partner. I want to make sure that there is mutual respect toward Australia and toward the United States. I want to make sure that we can have an ambassador that who can work effectively with the government, whether that\u2019s the US or wherever an ambassador might be appointed. Plibersek says Rudd should stay as ambassador to the US The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, has backed former boss Kevin Rudd to remain on as ambassador to the United States, amid suggestions he could be fired by the incoming president, Donald Trump. Rudd has a history of criticising Trump, and this week Dan Scavino, a senior adviser to Trump, reposted Rudd\u2019s congratulatory statement to the president-elect on social media with a gif of an hourglass. But Plibersek told Sky News she was \u201cnot at all\u201d concerned about the situation and that Rudd has \u201cdistinguished himself as ambassador.\u201d He\u2019s widely recognised as one of the world\u2019s pre-eminent experts on China and particularly on the time of Xi Jinping as leader. We know that people like Malcolm Turnbull, a former Liberal prime minister, and other prominent Liberals, including former ambassadors, have said that it\u2019s important for Kevin Rudd to remain as ambassador and it shows Australia\u2019s strength. The communications minister has continued doing the media rounds this morning, speaking on 2GB about the government\u2019s move to regulate social media companies. She said that part of the plan was to encourage \u201clow-risk services\u201d like YouTube Kids. Rowland also said Snapchat could also be excluded, and that some platforms \u201cpresent themselves in different way\u201d: We will go through, in a methodical way, having these criteria and the eSafety commissioner applying what will be a very transparent process. Some of these platforms do present themselves in different way. They will argue, for example, that they are messaging services and not social media services. We need to assess that objectively against a transparent set of criteria. Natalie Hutchins says free period products will be introduced in regional Victoria next year The minister for women, Natalie Hutchins, says there will be two types of machines rolled out. There are more static machines that will be regularly topped up, maybe on a weekly or fortnightly basis. But we know where machines are in high traffic areas, they may need a supply top up more often, and so we need those hi-tech machines to be able to feed back to us [information]. In stage-two of next year\u2019s roll out, we\u2019ll be rolling out into regional areas and beyond libraries into train stations, and health services, as well. Storms set to batter south-east Queensland Queensland is bracing for some severe thunderstorms that are set to batter the south-east coast, amid warnings from the Bureau of Meteorology that residents should remain up-to-date and monitor conditions. Hail of up to 5cm, alongside heavy rainfall and damaging winds, are forecast over the south-east coast, eastern parts of the Darling Downs, the Wyatt Bay, and the Burnett area at around midday today. Christie Johnson, meteorologist at the bureau, said storms had already been kicking off over the Gulf Country: There\u2019s a trough line between the Gulf Country and south-east Queensland, so storms are likely or possible anywhere, sort of along that line extending from the north-west down to the south-east. There could be, could be severe thunderstorms and warnings, obviously, will be issued as soon as we see any storms that are likely to produce severe weather. Jacinta Allan introduces free period products in public spaces The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, is at the State Library of Victoria to launch the rollout of free pads and tampons in public spaces. The library has three of the first 50 vending machines, with 1,500 to eventually be installed in 700 public places. She says: Women and girls know that feeling \u2013 there\u2019s nothing worse than being out and about and being caught short. We also know that for many women and girls, access to these period products is a cost of living pressure for them, it\u2019s a significant cost of living pressure, because for too long, too often these items are seeing as a luxury and a priced accordingly but they\u2019re a necessity. My government, the minister, myself, we understand this. Mark Butler says national anti-vaping program to be introduced in high schools in 2025 The health minister, Mark Butler, was on RN Breakfast earlier, where he said the national anti-vaping program will be rolled out in high schools next year. Butler said a trial of the program showed \u201creally good results.\u201d Earlier this year, the government said they would be leaning on social media influencers to get the message out, with Butler saying they have to \u201cgo where they are\u201d: Well that\u2019s something we\u2019re going to have to work through. We have to go where they are. And you know, they\u2019re not watching TV in a traditional way that you and I were at high school. They\u2019re certainly not reading newspapers by and large. So we have to go where they are. At the moment, they\u2019re on social media. Man, 32, charged over 3D firearm A man has been charged in New South Wales for allegedly 3D printing a firearm. A 32-year-old was charged with three counts of possession of an unauthorised firearm, the manufacture of a prohibited weapon without a permit, two counts of possession of a digital blueprint for making prohibited weapons, among other charges. In November 2024, officers attached to Moree proactive crime team and crime prevention unit commenced investigations into the manufacturing of firearms via 3D printing. Following investigations, at about 3.40pm yesterday, officers from the New England police district executed a search warrant on a home on Amaroo Drive, Moree. During a search of the property, officers allegedly located and seized a 3D printer, firearms and parts, ammunition, computers and telecommunication devices. The man was refused bail and will appear in Inverell local court today. Could Donald Trump really fire Kevin Rudd? The former prime minister\u2019s criticism of Donald Trump has drawn the ire of those in the president elect\u2019s inner circle, and prompted renewed debate about whether the incoming administration could seek retribution. Karen Middleton has the latest: Independent MP Monique Ryan has dismissed the idea Australia should appoint an Elon Musk-style billionaire into a \u201cgovernment efficiency\u201d position. Musk has been appointed into the newly created position in the Trump administration, and Ryan was asked on the Today show if Australian billionaires like Gina Rinehart should be appointed into such a position in Australia. I\u2019d be very much opposed to that. You\u2019ve got the world\u2019s richest man, and you\u2019ve given him this position of incredible influence in the American government. I think jobs for mates is a very bad idea. I don\u2019t think that politicians should be putting their friends, their dear friends into positions of great influence in this country. It\u2019s time for the Reserve Bank to admit that it\u2019s got it wrong on inflation and start cutting rates, according to our economics columnist Greg Jericho. Figures out yesterday showed that in the past year private sector wages rose 3.5%, down from 4.1% in the June quarter, Greg writes, in the biggest one quarter fall since the GFC in 2009. He notes that six years ago he wrote a piece asking what had happened to pay rises in Australia and it it\u2019s \u201cannoying\u201d how well it holds up with earnings still subdued. Here\u2019s Greg\u2019s column today: The October jobs figures out at 11.30am this morning will give the latest update on what we can expect from the economy going forward and we might even get some more insight from Reserve Bank governor Michele Bullock when she appears at a panel discussion in Sydney today. As mentioned at the start we have an exclusive interview with the former Liberal MP John Alexander, a keen advocate of high-speed rail between Newcastle and Sydney. He chaired parliamentary inquiries into the feasibility of the project but he fears that plans to position two of the stop-off points at Central Station and the centre of Gosford would make it impossible to recoup the costs from value capture \u2013 a tax on the future sale of land and homes in the vicinity of stations where the value has skyrocketed due to the new infrastructure. It is essential, he argues, that the stations are located outside the densest population centres \u2013 for example, in greenfield areas 15 minutes outside Gosford\u2019s centre, or between Sydney\u2019s eastern CBD and Parramatta \u2013 on land that can allow for development of significant new housing. He warns: Without value capture you\u2019re concentrating wealth among speculators and lucky landowners at taxpayers\u2019 expense. It\u2019s a very close cousin to negative gearing. It will become a mechanism to concentrate wealth. Good morning, Mostafa Rachwani with you to take you through the rest of the day\u2019s news. More from Sarah on the money-laundering bill. Australia remains one of the few jurisdictions in the world not to force accountants, real estate agents and lawyers to report suspicious transactions \u2013 including unexplained wealth used to purchase property \u2013 to a financial intelligence agency. In 2015, the global financial watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force, found that Australia had failed to comply with a number of critical standards and was at risk of being \u201cgreylisted\u201d \u2013 a move that puts a country under increased scrutiny and monitoring. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, delivered a scorching rebuke of the Coalition\u2019s position, saying opposition to the bill would aid criminal networks. Dreyfus said: Opposing these reforms means aiding and abetting the criminal abuse of our financial system by drug traffickers, human trafficking, cybercriminals, terrorists and those who exploit and abuse children. Opposing these reforms enables criminals to continue to engage in and profit from those serious crimes. If the Liberal party continues to oppose this bill, it is aiding the criminal networks who engage in despicable acts that hurt our whole community. Read more here: Liberals object to parts of anti-money laundering proposal A Labor-chaired committee has given its seal of approval on the federal government\u2019s proposal to toughen anti-money laundering and terrorism financing laws forcing lawyers, accountants and real estate agents to report suspicious transactions. But doubt has been cast over whether it will sail through parliament into law after Liberal members of the committee said they couldn\u2019t support the bill in its current form, pointing to higher cost burdens for small businesses. The changes would extend reporting obligations to those in \u201csecond tranche\u201d roles that help clients with services, such as lawyers, accountants and real estate agents. The government\u2019s preferred option is expected to cost $13.9bn over 10 years, according to a recent impact analysis, and would simplify the laws while including the new reporting obligations. The Liberal senator Paul Scarr said the bill must be changed to \u201cremove or substantially minimise\u201d the cost burden for business, which he said would be passed on to consumers. \u201cDuring the Albanese government\u2019s cost of living crisis, this is something Australians can ill-afford,\u201d Scarr said in the committee report\u2019s additional comments. The housing minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, has declared that enabling Australians to buy a home is \u201can article of faith\u201d and that secure housing, whether for buyers or renters, is what gives people \u201cchoice and control\u201d over their lives. Before parliament\u2019s final fortnight of sittings next week, when another showdown looms over blocked government legislation, O\u2019Neil used a speech in Melbourne last night in memory of the late Victorian Labor premier John Cain to renew the government\u2019s attack on the federal Coalition and Greens for refusing to support its housing plans. O\u2019Neil said the government\u2019s Build to Rent and Help to Buy bills were being blocked by \u201can unholy, destructive, anti-housing coalition built of the conservatives and the Greens\u201d. \u201cLabor wants Australians to have choice and control so they can build a life that\u2019s meaningful for them. For those that are renting, we want you to have a secure and affordable home, not just a place to live \u2013 to have a family when it suits you. We want Australians to have choice about where they live and how they live, over where their kids grow up, on the jobs they have access to and how long they commute.\u201d She particularly emphasised home ownership, which she said too many people now saw as \u201ca luxury\u201d. \u201cAfter all, we are a home-owning nation. If you work hard, you should have the security of owning your own home.\u201d She flagged more federal government measures on housing between now and next year\u2019s federal election. The federal government will require social media platforms to assume a \u201cdigital duty of care\u201d for users, with plans to put the onus on digital companies to take proactive steps to safeguard the mental health of its customers. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, made the announcement last night at a speech to the Sydney Institute. It will put the legal responsibility for keeping Australians safe on to the platforms themselves, including obligating social media platforms to identify and mitigate potential risks as the services and society changes. She said: To my mind, what\u2019s required is a shift away from reacting to harms by relying on content regulation alone, and moving towards systems-based prevention, accompanied by a broadening of our perspective of what online harms are. The minister, a former lawyer, said a duty of care was \u201ca common law concept and statutory obligation that places a legal obligation to take reasonable steps to protect others from harm\u201d. Where platforms seriously and systemically breach their duty of care we will ensure the regulator can draw on strong penalty arrangements. We don\u2019t have a lot of information about how it will work, with Rowland\u2019s office only releasing broad details about the proposal, but we will expect to hear more in coming weeks. It is understood the digital duty of care was a key recommendation of an independent review of the Online Safety Act, which was handed to government weeks ago but which hasn\u2019t been released yet. It adds to the government\u2019s already-bulging set of proposed and looming reforms in the tech and social media space, including the ban on social media for under-16s, the mis- and disinformation laws, and potential changes to the news media bargaining code. It potentially opens up another front in a conflict with the social media companies, some of whom are already unhappy with growing government regulation and new rules on how their systems operate. Good morning and welcome to our live news coverage. I\u2019m Martin Farrer, bringing you some of the best overnight stories before my colleague Mostafa Rachwani guides you through the main action of the day. The commonwealth will argue in two high court challenges today that the constitution allows the government to detain non-citizens while their protection visa applications are processed, even if they will be released after a decision either way. It will urge the court to reject the cases that seek to extend the landmark NZYQ decision on indefinite detention to a new cohort of people in immigration detention. We will bring you the latest when it happens. The federal government will require social media platforms to assume a \u201cdigital duty of care\u201d for users, with plans to put the onus on digital companies to take proactive steps to safeguard the mental health of its customers. Speaking in Sydney last night, Michelle Rowland, the communications minister, said the changes were needed to put the legal responsibility for safeguarding on to the companies and away from just a regulatory approach. More coming up. The October jobs figures out at 11.30am this morning will give the latest update on what we can expect from the economy and we might even get some more insight from the Reserve Bank governor, Michele Bullock, when she appears at a panel discussion on the state of the economy at an Asic forum in Sydney at 10am this morning. More coming up. Australia\u2019s push for high-speed rail is ignoring expert advice and parliamentary findings, according to a former MP who chaired the inquiries, warning planners are pursuing expensive station locations where recouping costs will be so difficult it could derail the project. In an interview with Guardian Australia, John Alexander pleads with the High Speed Rail Authority to place stations outside the Sydney and Gosford CBDs in order to maximise land value capture and therefore secure future funding of the scheme.",

Nowland, who weighed 47.5kg, had been carrying the serrated steak knife in one hand after repeated requests to put it down and was supporting herself on her walker with the other hand when White discharged the Taser to disarm her. She died a week later from a head injury caused by being tasered, the court has heard. White\u2019s barrister, Troy Edwards SC, has told the court it is not in dispute that the injuries caused by White tasering Nowland ultimately killed her. But he argued that White\u2019s use of the Taser involved a reasonable use of force. The prosecutor, Brett Hatfield SC, has argued that White was guilty of manslaughter by way of criminal negligence or by way of an unlawful and dangerous act. Pank told the court that responders found Nowland in a treatment room, seated by her walker with a knife and another object in her hand. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The jury had previously heard that it was only around three minutes between responders finding Nowland and White shooting her with the Taser. Pank said Nowland raised the knife at her three times as she made attempts to retrieve it. \u201cI remember saying to Kristian White, I think I can get the knife off her, I remember him saying, I\u2019ll cover you. I remember moving forward because her hand was on the walker with the knife facing downwards,\u201d Pank told the court. \u201cI thought I could grab her arm and somehow get the knife out of her hand.\u201d Pank said when she stepped forward to get the steak knife, she didn\u2019t feel at a safe distance and thought she could be stabbed. Asked by Hatfield if she had any reaction to White drawing his Taser, Pank said \u201cno\u201d. Under cross-examination by Edwards, the court heard that Pank had said in a statement after the incident that she was comfortable with White\u2019s decision to draw his Taser. She also agreed under questioning that there were a number of times when she thought she could be stabbed, and that distance \u201cfeels different when there\u2019s a knife raised at you\u201d. The two paramedics who also attended the incident appeared as witnesses on Thursday. Paramedic Anna Hofner \u2013 who stood in the doorway of the room where Nowland was with the knife and stepped back to let police take control \u2013 told the court she felt no immediate danger from Nowland. \u201cI suggest to you there was no danger of any of you being struck by her, do you agree or disagree?\u201d Hatfield asked Hofner. \u201cI agree,\u201d Hofner responded. However, under cross-examination by Edwards, Hofner backtracked, saying she did worry that she may be stabbed. Hofner told the court that when Pank stepped towards Nowland, \u201c[Nowland] had a look in her eyes like she\u2019d like to strike out\u201d with the knife and \u201charm\u201d Pank. Hofner said Nowland held up the knife in a \u201cfaster movement than I expected from her\u201d. \u201cClare immediately raised the knife towards Jess in quite a quick motion and looked directly at her, so Jess stepped back,\u201d Hofner said. \u201cI\u2019m not 100% sure if something else happened, but that might have been when Kristian pulled out the Taser. Or I turned to my partner and asked to him to draw out medication,\u201d Hofner added, referring to a sedative the paramedics planned to administer to Nowland to calm her. Hofner told the court that after White discharged the Taser \u2013 from which he fired a visual and aural warning before the shot \u2013 Nowland \u201cdidn\u2019t appear to acknowledge what had occurred\u201d. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any obvious response, apart from the fact she did continue to walk towards him,\u201d Hofner said. Hofner had also told the court that when she had asked Nowland to put the knife down moments earlier, \u201cthere was no acknowledgment that she\u2019d heard me\u201d. \u201cShe didn\u2019t seem to acknowledge anything I said,\u201d she told the court. On Wednesday, the court heard from the geriatrician Susan Kurrle that Nowland displayed behaviours consistent with having moderate to severe dementia, which would have impacted her ability to comply with instructions. Hofner told the court that Nowland appeared to not have any intent to put down the knife. Asked by Hatfield if Nowland would have put it down had they waited long enough, Hofner responded: \u201cPossibly \u2026 but how long would we have had to wait?\u201d Hofner agreed under cross-examination that she had determined that \u201csome sort of physical action\u201d needed to be taken after verbal requests did not work. She also said that the sedative the paramedics had prepared could not be administered to Nowland until she was disarmed. The second attending paramedic, Kingsley Peter Newman, also appeared before the court as a witness on Thursday. He said that when the emergency responders and staff had been walking around the nursing home looking for Nowland, they found Nowland had \u201cdiscarded\u201d one of two knives she was carrying. Newman said after Nowland was tasered, she quickly developed a haematoma to her head that was of concern, and displayed other symptoms which indicated a \u201csignificant\u201d brain bleed. The trial, before Justice Ian Harrison, continues.",

Grant Ramage, an executive at IGA and Foodland brand owner Metcash, said the amount of groceries flowing through their network, which it relies on to build competitive supply and distribution chains, was threatened by the acquisition strategy used by Australia\u2019s major supermarkets. \u201cThey typically aren\u2019t interested in buying small independents, they would pick off the larger independents, the very successful stores that contribute disproportionately high volume to the total independent network\u2019s volume,\u201d Ramage told the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission inquiry. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cI\u2019ve described it previously as decapitation; taking the big stores at the top away has a disproportionate effect on our network.\u201d The testimony is part of a government-ordered examination into grocery prices and competition in the supermarket sector, where Coles and Woolworths have a dominant two-thirds share. The major chains have faced intense scrutiny over their pricing practices and have drawn criticism from all political parties before an election expected to be fought on cost-of-living pressures. Guardian Australia analysis has found that profit margins at the major supermarkets are now significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels, and have jumped ahead of most of their international peers. Coles and Woolworths have consistently defended their business practices, and have described competition in the sector as strong, citing competitive pressures from Aldi, Costco, Metcash/IGA, Amazon and other independently owned stores. Consumer advocates and executives at Aldi have already appeared at the inquiry, while representatives of the major chains are due to do so next week. Ramage, who is chief executive of Metcash\u2019s food division which supplies IGA and other store networks, said the major chains also used their land holdings and shopping centre purchases to \u201cprevent independent supermarkets from doing business\u201d. Metcash\u2019s business model differs from the big supermarkets given it acts as a wholesaler that distributes groceries to its networks, some of which licence the IGA brand. Its network generally operates smaller stores than the major chains. Metcash-supplied stores often operate in more remote locations, contrasting with Aldi which told the inquiry this week it only sets up in areas with large population centres. Ramage told the ACCC inquiry on Thursday that Coles and Woolworths use their financial clout and market power to secure supermarket sites, locking out smaller rivals. \u201cWhen we investigate, we find that those sites were unavailable because they\u2019ve been land banked by one of the chains,\u201d Ramage said. \u201cThere are other examples where there are existing stores or opportunities that are not available to us because Coles and Woolworths have acquired the site or found another way to remove the IGA or the independent from that location.\u201d Coles and Woolworths deny that they land bank, arguing that most of their undeveloped sites are in new areas and growth corridors. The ACCC is scheduled to produce a final report for the federal government in February, with potential recommendations on how to increase competition in the sector.",

The president-elect nominated congressman Matt Gaetz to serve as attorney general, the country\u2019s chief law officer. Gaetz has protested against election results alongside far-right groups and faced an inquiry by the House ethics committee over allegations including sexual misconduct. The inquiry ended when he resigned from Congress on Wednesday. He has denied any wrongdoing. Some of Gaetz\u2019s Republican colleagues slammed his nomination, which representative Max Miller labelled \u201creckless\u201d and \u201csilly\u201d, and senator Lisa Murkowski said was not serious. John Bolton, a former national security adviser, said Gaetz \u201cmust be the worst nomination for a cabinet position in American history\u201d. Trump also announced his nominee for director of national intelligence would be Tulsi Gabbard, who is a critic of Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and has questioned atrocities attributed to the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. Gabbard has previously clashed with Marco Rubio, who Trump on Wednesday confirmed would be nominated as secretary of state. The new appointments followed Trump\u2019s announcement of Peter Hegseth for defence in a move that stunned military officials, some of whom questioned whether Hegseth had the experience to manage a government department with a budget of more than $800bn. Here\u2019s what else happened on Wednesday: Trump cabinet news and updates Republicans in the House of Representatives have retained their majority, securing the 218 seats required. Mike Johnson won the party\u2019s nomination to stay on as House speaker, gaining Trump\u2019s endorsement before the vote on Wednesday despite internal dissent from hard-right conservatives and the Freedom Caucus. Republican senators chose South Dakota\u2019s John Thune as their new leader, rejecting a challenge from Florida senator Rick Scott, who had the backing of key Maga figures Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson. Thune\u2019s elevation comes after long-serving Mitch McConnell stood aside. Joe Biden met Trump at the White House, extending a courtesy to the president-elect that Biden was not offered in 2020 when Trump refused to acknowledge Biden\u2019s election victory. Trump thanked Biden for welcoming him back to the Oval Office and said: \u201cPolitics is tough, and it\u2019s [in] many cases not a very nice world, but it is a nice world today.\u201d The president-elect met with House Republicans before going to the White House, and joked about seeking a third term, which would be constitutionally prohibited after his second term. Wednesday\u2019s appointments leave a handful of roles to fill in Trump\u2019s cabinet. Reuters reported billionaire banker and co-chair of Trump\u2019s transition team Howard Lutnick had emerged as a serious contender against investor Scott Bessent for the role of Treasury secretary, the highest profile job without a name yet attached. The Democratic minority leader in the House, Hakeem Jeffries, said his colleagues had \u201cover-performed the national political environment\u201d, pre-empting the news that Republicans had retained the chamber. Elizabeth Warren argued Democrats should show they stand ready to \u201cunrig this economy\u201d as billionaires join the Trump administration.

Dan Scavino, who on Tuesday suggested Australia\u2019s ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, was running out of time, has been named as assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff.

In the past few years, we have seen women\u2019s rights and freedoms, already severely curtailed, swept away as Taliban edicts have fallen like hammer blows.</p> <p>In just over three years, Afghan women have been banned from nearly every aspect of public life: schools, universities, most workplaces \u2013 even parks and bathhouses. From Kandahar, the birthplace and political headquarters of the Taliban, the group\u2019s leaders have dictated that women must cover their faces in public, always be accompanied by a man and never let their voices be heard in public.</p> <p>As foreign women, we still carried the rare privilege of freedom of movement (although I doubt we could now travel as we did at the beginning of this year), which has nearly disappeared for the 14 million Afghan women and girls across the country. Meeting women while ensuring their security was a daily challenge.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Mitra plays with children in Yamit district, near the Wakhan mountains. Her daughter and her cousin, who were both grade 11 pupils aged about 17, took their own lives in these pools last year</p></li> </ul> <p>Each province we travelled to revealed different shades of oppression. In some areas \u2013 in the south and east in particular \u2013 women were already living under very restricted conditions before the Taliban\u2019s official return, with many saying that now, at least, there was no more violence.

      "bodyText": "Earlier this year, I spent 10 weeks travelling with the photographer Kiana Hayeri across seven provinces of Afghanistan, speaking to more than 100 Afghan women and girls about how their lives had changed since the Taliban swept back to power three years ago. Hayeri and I both lived in Afghanistan for years, and remained here after the Taliban took control in August 2021. In the past few years, we have seen women\u2019s rights and freedoms, already severely curtailed, swept away as Taliban edicts have fallen like hammer blows. In just over three years, Afghan women have been banned from nearly every aspect of public life: schools, universities, most workplaces \u2013 even parks and bathhouses. From Kandahar, the birthplace and political headquarters of the Taliban, the group\u2019s leaders have dictated that women must cover their faces in public, always be accompanied by a man and never let their voices be heard in public. As foreign women, we still carried the rare privilege of freedom of movement (although I doubt we could now travel as we did at the beginning of this year), which has nearly disappeared for the 14 million Afghan women and girls across the country. Meeting women while ensuring their security was a daily challenge. Mitra plays with children in Yamit district, near the Wakhan mountains. Her daughter and her cousin, who were both grade 11 pupils aged about 17, took their own lives in these pools last year Each province we travelled to revealed different shades of oppression. In some areas \u2013 in the south and east in particular \u2013 women were already living under very restricted conditions before the Taliban\u2019s official return, with many saying that now, at least, there was no more violence. In other places, the sudden loss of freedom has been devastating. For many, the Taliban\u2019s refusal to allow girls to attend secondary education has been the hardest blow. We met Gulsom, 17, who survived a suicide attack on her school just a few months before the Taliban came back into power. Severely wounded and left unable to walk, she must now use a wheelchair and had to continue her studies at an underground school. But Gulsom insisted: \u201cMy will to study and work hard has increased.\u201d In Gardi Ghos district, primary-school classes \u2013 which are still legal for girls up to the age of 11 \u2013 are set up by two main roads with no shade Girls attend art classes at a shop inside a west Kabul shopping centre Yet her younger sister, who is 14, seems to have lost hope. She has left the house only a few times in more than two years. Gulsom said: \u201c[In 2021] she went to school on the day they were supposed to open, but she returned crying. [The Taliban] fired [shots] to disperse the girls, as they were asking when will the schools would open. She said the Taliban beat two girls and warned them not to leave their homes.\u201d Since then, she has sunk into a deep depression. Gulsom said: \u201cShe always asks me, \u2018What is the use of studying this much? At the end you will die. I don\u2019t work hard, I will die; and you work hard, you will die too. I want to die in peace.\u2019\u201d We spoke to many girls who no longer see the value of trying to continue their education at home when they cannot graduate from school, cannot work and cannot imagine a future for themselves. For some of the young women we met, being barred from school now means they have to try to find a job or get married, like the young women in one province who spend their days sewing school uniforms for the young girls still allowed into the primary classroom. Asaa, 21, and Nazbibi, 20, work at a women-led spaghetti factory in Kabul, set up in 2021 to create jobs for women unable to work or study Sewing uniforms for younger girls in a Kabul garment workshop; above right, Maryam, 14, was determined to continue her education but has had to become engaged to her landlord\u2019s son in Jalalabad We also saw how the economic crisis gripping the country since the Taliban took power has proved catastrophic for many girls and women. At only 14, Maryam has been forced to become engaged to her landlord\u2019s son in exchange for a well and solar panels, after her family could not find work. Her family was part of the wave of returnees expelled from Pakistan in late 2023. As undocumented refugees, they were harassed into leaving by the Pakistani police. They are now struggling to rebuild their lives, with few job prospects and virtually no social security assistance. Afghans who had fled the country but were forced to leave Pakistan last year have to live in tents in the city of Jalalabad \u201cI went to a madrasa in Pakistan, but here I cannot go,\u201d she told us. \u201cI\u2019m good at reading and writing.

It was important for us to look beyond the traditional representations of Afghan women as passive victims of the Taliban and show them as active players in their own lives. We wanted to show their strength in the face of this absurd and brutal regime, including through acts of resistance: attending underground education networks or creating informal gatherings \u2013 whether it is a snowball fight, a birthday party, art classes or henna painting. These acts, though small, are profound forms of resistance against the Taliban\u2019s efforts to strip away and deny their humanity \u2013 perhaps the deepest form of violence that is being inflicted against millions of women and girls across the country.

      "body": "<p>Doorbells have evolved. Today, they watch us as we approach, let the people inside the home know we\u2019re coming sooner than our finger can hit the button, and give them a good look at our faces before they open the door. They\u2019re essentially security cameras with a chime function.</p> <p>If you haven\u2019t already installed one of these handy tools, there\u2019s a huge array available. Choosing the best video doorbell can be a bewildering task, with various factors to consider, including how much of your doorstep you want to see or whether you\u2019re prepared to pay for a subscription. To help make the decision a little bit easier, I\u2019ve tested eight popular video doorbells to find the best.</p> <h2>At a glance</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Best overall video doorbell: <br></strong>Google Nest doorbell (battery)<em><br></em><a href=\"https://www.currys.co.uk/products/google-nest-doorbell-battery-10227776.html\"><sub>\u00a3139 at Currys</sub></a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Best budget video doorbell: </strong><br>Blink smart video doorbell with Sync Module 2<br><a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/blink-smart-video-doorbell-with-sync-module-2/p6261006\"><sub>\u00a369 at John Lewis</sub></a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Best subscription-free video doorbell:</strong> <br>Eufy video doorbell E340<br><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/eufy-Security-Doorbell-Delivery-Expandable/dp/B0CF8RPX5M\"><sub>\u00a3155.17 at Amazon</sub></a></p></li> </ul> <h2>Why you should trust me</h2> <p>I\u2019ve been testing products, including everything from vacuum cleaners and robot lawnmowers to computers and games, for various publications for more than three decades. I\u2019ve also owned a video doorbell for a couple of years, so I am well aware of their strengths and weaknesses. It gives me a good understanding of what I\u2019m likely to be looking for in the next one I buy.</p> <h2>How I tested</h2> <p>The only way to test a doorbell is to stick it next to your front door and see how well it works. To achieve this, I mounted all eight on a board at doorbell height and lived with this rigged-up contraption on my doorstep for a fortnight. Delivery drivers were rightly suspicious of the number of buttons and cameras, and struggled to work out whether it was them or the doorbells that were being tested. </p> <p>I\u2019m not sure whether my neighbours noticed them all, or spotted the number of times I lapped my drive at various times of day and night to test the movement sensors. If they did, they were too polite to mention it.</p> <p>I compared the doorbells by measuring how close I could get to the door before the motion detection was triggered, how much video was recorded and how useful that footage was. I timed how long it took for notifications to reach the doorbells\u2019 apps on a smartphone and how long it took for the doorbell to send an alert or ring a chime (if included) when its button was pressed. I also tested the apps, examined the prices and considered the additional cost of subscriptions.</p> <p>All doorbells that didn\u2019t need to be returned to the brands are being donated to the British Heart Foundation.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <h2>The best video doorbells in 2024</h2>    <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <h2><em>Best overall:</em> <br>Google Nest doorbell Doorbell (battery)</h2>    <p>Doorbells can be inundated with features, and their apps can be amazing. But if they don\u2019t do a good job of letting you know when someone approaches your door and captures a video of them, there really isn\u2019t much point. The Nest Doorbell (battery) performed these tasks the best.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>In my tests, the Nest was a solid all-rounder. I found the viewing angle of its lens to be about perfect, not going so wide that people appear too small but still capturing enough of the surrounding area to catch people skirting around its periphery. The video and audio were as consistently clear as those on any of the doorbells I tested, and they were decent both in daylight and at night.</p> <p>The Nest sometimes detected people right at the end of my drive but proved consistent at capturing movement from about 3m away. I found there was some delay between the button being pressed and notifications arriving on Nest devices and smartphones, but it averaged at a fairly reasonable five seconds. While not as fast as the doorbells that had dedicated local chimes, which tend to go off almost immediately, this was among the fastest for sending alerts to smartphones and smart speakers.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 </strong>it doesn\u2019t come with a chime. Instead, you need to buy a separate <a href=\"https://ao.com/product/ga00781gb-google-nest-mini-smart-speaker-charcoal-72729-301.aspx\">Nest Mini smart speaker</a>, which costs \u00a349. You also really need the <a href=\"https://store.google.com/gb/product/nest_aware?\">Nest Aware subscription</a> at \u00a360 a year \u2013 without it, motion events are stored for only three hours, which isn\u2019t hugely useful.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.currys.co.uk/products/google-nest-doorbell-battery-10227776.html\"><sub>\u00a3139 at Currys</sub></a><br><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Google-Nest-Doorbell-Battery-Wireless/dp/B09TBCTQ59\"><sub>\u00a3129.99 at Amazon</sub></a></p> <p><strong>Subscription:</strong> Nest Aware (30-day storage, records only when movement triggered), \u00a36/month or \u00a360/year; Nest Aware Plus (60-day storage, records 24/7), \u00a312/month or \u00a3120/year</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <h2><em>Best budget:</em> <br>Blink smart video doorbell with Sync Module 2</h2>    <p>The Blink is the only model I reviewed that cost less than \u00a3100. Amazon\u2019s bargain basement doorbell costs as little as \u00a359 and, while you get what you pay for in terms of quality, it does the job.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>Price is the key selling point here because it\u2019s significantly more affordable than its nearest competitor. However, we reviewed the version that comes with Blink\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/blink-sync-module-2/dp/B08BJ9ZCZC\">Sync Module 2</a>, which costs only \u00a310 more. This plugs into a wall socket and lets you connect USB storage (I used a USB flash memory drive). The device then locally backs up video that\u2019s saved to the cloud, so you won\u2019t lose any footage unless your local storage fills up. You still need a (relatively affordable) subscription for motion detection to work, though.</p> <p>For a cheaper camera, I was impressed with the video footage.

      "bodyText": "Doorbells have evolved. Today, they watch us as we approach, let the people inside the home know we\u2019re coming sooner than our finger can hit the button, and give them a good look at our faces before they open the door. They\u2019re essentially security cameras with a chime function. If you haven\u2019t already installed one of these handy tools, there\u2019s a huge array available. Choosing the best video doorbell can be a bewildering task, with various factors to consider, including how much of your doorstep you want to see or whether you\u2019re prepared to pay for a subscription. To help make the decision a little bit easier, I\u2019ve tested eight popular video doorbells to find the best. At a glance Best overall video doorbell: Google Nest doorbell (battery) \u00a3139 at Currys Best budget video doorbell: Blink smart video doorbell with Sync Module 2 \u00a369 at John Lewis Best subscription-free video doorbell: Eufy video doorbell E340 \u00a3155.17 at Amazon Why you should trust me I\u2019ve been testing products, including everything from vacuum cleaners and robot lawnmowers to computers and games, for various publications for more than three decades. I\u2019ve also owned a video doorbell for a couple of years, so I am well aware of their strengths and weaknesses. It gives me a good understanding of what I\u2019m likely to be looking for in the next one I buy. How I tested The only way to test a doorbell is to stick it next to your front door and see how well it works. To achieve this, I mounted all eight on a board at doorbell height and lived with this rigged-up contraption on my doorstep for a fortnight. Delivery drivers were rightly suspicious of the number of buttons and cameras, and struggled to work out whether it was them or the doorbells that were being tested. I\u2019m not sure whether my neighbours noticed them all, or spotted the number of times I lapped my drive at various times of day and night to test the movement sensors. If they did, they were too polite to mention it. I compared the doorbells by measuring how close I could get to the door before the motion detection was triggered, how much video was recorded and how useful that footage was. I timed how long it took for notifications to reach the doorbells\u2019 apps on a smartphone and how long it took for the doorbell to send an alert or ring a chime (if included) when its button was pressed. I also tested the apps, examined the prices and considered the additional cost of subscriptions. All doorbells that didn\u2019t need to be returned to the brands are being donated to the British Heart Foundation. * * * The best video doorbells in 2024 * * * Best overall: Google Nest doorbell Doorbell (battery) Doorbells can be inundated with features, and their apps can be amazing. But if they don\u2019t do a good job of letting you know when someone approaches your door and captures a video of them, there really isn\u2019t much point. The Nest Doorbell (battery) performed these tasks the best. Why we love it In my tests, the Nest was a solid all-rounder. I found the viewing angle of its lens to be about perfect, not going so wide that people appear too small but still capturing enough of the surrounding area to catch people skirting around its periphery. The video and audio were as consistently clear as those on any of the doorbells I tested, and they were decent both in daylight and at night. The Nest sometimes detected people right at the end of my drive but proved consistent at capturing movement from about 3m away. I found there was some delay between the button being pressed and notifications arriving on Nest devices and smartphones, but it averaged at a fairly reasonable five seconds. While not as fast as the doorbells that had dedicated local chimes, which tend to go off almost immediately, this was among the fastest for sending alerts to smartphones and smart speakers. It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 it doesn\u2019t come with a chime. Instead, you need to buy a separate Nest Mini smart speaker, which costs \u00a349. You also really need the Nest Aware subscription at \u00a360 a year \u2013 without it, motion events are stored for only three hours, which isn\u2019t hugely useful. \u00a3139 at Currys \u00a3129.99 at Amazon Subscription: Nest Aware (30-day storage, records only when movement triggered), \u00a36/month or \u00a360/year; Nest Aware Plus (60-day storage, records 24/7), \u00a312/month or \u00a3120/year * * * Best budget: Blink smart video doorbell with Sync Module 2 The Blink is the only model I reviewed that cost less than \u00a3100. Amazon\u2019s bargain basement doorbell costs as little as \u00a359 and, while you get what you pay for in terms of quality, it does the job. Why we love it Price is the key selling point here because it\u2019s significantly more affordable than its nearest competitor. However, we reviewed the version that comes with Blink\u2019s Sync Module 2, which costs only \u00a310 more. This plugs into a wall socket and lets you connect USB storage (I used a USB flash memory drive). The device then locally backs up video that\u2019s saved to the cloud, so you won\u2019t lose any footage unless your local storage fills up. You still need a (relatively affordable) subscription for motion detection to work, though. For a cheaper camera, I was impressed with the video footage. It has a wide-angle lens, so there\u2019s a bit of a fish-eye effect around the edges, but it\u2019s not so wide that people approaching the doorbell look tiny. It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 the two-way audio isn\u2019t great. The quality of the microphone was the worst I tested, so it\u2019s best suited to those not planning to have lengthy conversations with people on the doorstep. \u00a369 at John Lewis \u00a369.99 at Amazon Subscription: Basic Plan, \u00a32.50/month or \u00a324.99/year, single device; Plus Plan, \u00a38/month or \u00a380/year, multiple devices * * * Best subscription-free: Eufy video doorbell E340 Most video doorbells provide limited features without additional costs, hiding all their best bits (such as storing video for any length of time) behind a paywall.

In a high-turnout ballot run by the National Pharmacy Association (NPA), which represents independent community pharmacies, 99% of pharmacy owners said they were willing to limit their services in the interests of patient safety if improved funding was not forthcoming. A total of 63.5% of members in England, Wales and Northern Ireland took part, representing 3,399 independent community pharmacies.

Unless funding for pharmacies is boosted in the coming weeks, pharmacy owners have voted to: Serve notice on opening hours above the minimum required by their contract \u2013 meaning fewer pharmacies will be open in the evenings and at weekends. Stop making free home deliveries of medicines that are not funded. Withdraw from locally commissioned services, including some local addiction support services, emergency contraception and smoking cessation support. Refuse to cooperate with certain data requests above those required for patient safety and contractual minimums. Withdraw from supplying free monitored dose systems (medicine packs) that the NHS does not pay them to provide, other than those covered by the Disability Discrimination Act.

      "bodyText": "A court ruling in favour of Shell does not spell the end of climate litigation against companies, legal experts have said. The oil and gas company celebrated on Tuesday when it won an appeal against a landmark climate judgment by a Dutch court. In 2021 a lower court ruled that Shell must cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 compared with 2019 levels. It was the first such ruling against a company in the world, and led to a growing trend of lawsuits against corporations. However, the Dutch court of appeal ruled that, while Shell did have a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d to cut its emissions as a major oil company, this would not be achieved by imposing a specific legal goal. Milieudefensie, the NGO that brought the claim, was disappointed with the ruling because it rejected its key demand. However, the lawyer Roger Cox said he could see a number of important points to build on in the NGO\u2019s legal battle against large polluters. \u201cThe court makes it abundantly clear that not only countries, but also companies, have a responsibility to reduce their emissions in line with the Paris climate agreement,\u201d said Cox. Thom Wetzer, an associate professor of law and finance at the University of Oxford, believes this leaves the door \u201cwide open\u201d for future litigation against corporations in the Netherlands and beyond. The appeal court found no solid basis on which to order Shell to cut its emissions by 45% by the end of the decade. Shell successfully argued that the target was based on a global average and did not take into account the fact that the company did not sell the most polluting fossil fuel, coal. Nor was the court persuaded by Milieudefensie\u2019s suggestions of more tailored emissions reductions for oil and gas. But the court agreed in principle that it was able to order companies to meet absolute emission reductions. Joana Setzer, an associate professor at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change, said this laid the basis for future claims, particularly once the EU set clear pathways for emission reductions in particular sectors. Noah Walker-Crawford, a research fellow at Grantham, said he believed scientists had an important role in this. \u201cResearch in this field is advancing rapidly to bridge the gap between global emissions reduction goals and specific actionable targets.\u201d The court stressed that business environmental rules were getting tougher. Both the EU\u2019s corporate sustainability reporting directive and its later corporate sustainability due diligence directive (CSDDD), which was finalised earlier this year and takes effect from 2027, impose climate-related obligations on companies such as Shell. According to Wetzer, the original Shell ruling was an important catalyst in changing the political landscape, \u201cwhich led business to support the CSDDD codification in an attempt to gain legal certainty\u201d. Setzer said these rules provided a more robust framework for holding corporations accountable but the court made it clear that they were not exhaustive. \u201cThis creates space for litigants to argue that companies must go beyond baseline regulatory compliance to fulfil their human rights and environmental responsibilities.\u201d The court affirmed that corporations had responsibilities to respect human rights.

But not in the way some may assume. Gray became famous because of three things: her Partygate investigation under Boris Johnson, her recruitment to Keir Starmer\u2019s team in opposition and for having once run a pub in Northern Ireland.

There was too much internal hurt, anger and mistrust around Gray. But this misses the larger, less personalised reason why her leaving is important. More than 18 months ago, a senior Labour official put it succinctly. Starmer had recruited Gray \u201cfor one sole purpose, preparing Labour for government\u201d. Unlike Starmer himself, and unlike most of those in line to be his ministers, Gray knew not just how Whitehall worked, but how it ought to work better.

But it could all have been foreseen. It certainly should have been far better handled. But not even this was what brought Gray down. The cause of her fall was that Gray\u2019s idea of how government ought to work was felt to have wilted under the realities of office. In particular, it did not satisfy Starmer himself, as he gradually became accustomed to having his feet under the Downing Street desk.</p> <p>Gray\u2019s failure, according to insider critics this week, was that she prepared Labour for government in exactly the wrong way. She did not accept the reality that, in modern politics and government, the centre will always want to shape what is done at departmental level. She instead encouraged ministers to trust the Whitehall machine, and to run their departments with their own goals and their own departmental narratives. It was this fundamental difference of approach that led to her being forced out.</p> <p>By October, Starmer had had enough. There seem to have been two main reasons. First, Gray did not prioritise the government\u2019s so-called missions \u2013 the yardsticks by which Starmer wishes Labour to be judged when the next election comes round. All of these \u2013 clean energy, highest G7 growth, NHS reform, educational opportunities and safer streets \u2013 are cross-departmental projects. So is the unofficial sixth mission: control of borders. Only the centre of government, Starmer told a meeting of the cabinet last week, can ensure that departments work together to deliver them.</p> <p>Starmer\u2019s second reason is that, in reality, it is he, more than any minister, who has to answer to the public for the success or failure of the government\u2019s priorities. His desk is where the buck stops. There is simply no other way. Like it or not, it is the prime minister \u2013 in press interviews, in parliament and when the next election comes \u2013 who has to make the case for the government\u2019s departmental priorities.</p> <p>This is why, in part, it was Starmer himself who went to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/11/keir-starmer-to-unveil-ambitious-new-uk-climate-goal-cop29-ndc\">Cop29 summit</a> in Baku this week to announce new commitments to cleaner energy goals. No 10 believes that the government\u2019s big themes, on which its re-election hopes will depend, need to be led from Downing Street and by the prime minister himself. The decision to go to Baku directly reflects what has changed with Gray\u2019s departure.</p> <p>It will now be followed by others. Starmer has spent a lot of time abroad in the government\u2019s early months, largely because the diary required his attendance at a succession of international gatherings, of which next week\u2019s G20 summit in Brazil will be the next in a long line that started with the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/european-political-community-meeting-2024\">European political community summit</a> at Blenheim Palace in July.</p> <p>Expect, though, before Christmas, to see Starmer starting to play a much more central role on domestic policy, too. There are at least two such events in the imminent Downing Street grid now. At least one of them is likely to involve making a case for NHS reforms of the kind that the health secretary, Wes Streeting, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/13/wes-streeting-hospital-league-table-plan-nhs-doctors-bosses\">announced this week</a>.</p> <p>This is the context in which stories suggesting the \u201creturn of the Blairites\u201d to Downing Street must be seen. For once, such tales are not exaggerations or scare stories. This time, they are simply true. The Blairites \u2013 or some of them \u2013 are indeed back. Their return does not embody a change of political direction for the Starmer government. More, it consolidates Starmer\u2019s willingness to grasp that Labour\u2019s project will not get far in the Trumpian 2020s unless it draws on experienced and politically savvy people who are willing to challenge shibboleths.</p> <p>The appointment of Tony Blair\u2019s former chief of staff Jonathan Powell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/08/jonathan-powell-tony-blair-former-chief-of-staff-appointed-national-security-adviser\">as national security adviser </a>from the start of December is the most eye-catching example of this. With Starmer refocusing on domestic policy, Powell is likely to carry a lot of the international heavy-lifting. But the return as director of policy delivery and innovation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/08/jonathan-powell-tony-blair-former-chief-of-staff-appointed-national-security-adviser\">of Liz Lloyd</a>, possessor of one of the driest senses of humour within the old Blair inner circle, is, if anything, more crucial. Most of the mission agenda will rest on her shoulders.</p> <p>None of this is to claim that Starmer\u2019s in-flight rebuilding of his governmental engine is without problems, still less that it will succeed. But it should be seen for what it is: as a very large change moment that makes coherent sense of Gray\u2019s departure. Back in the summer, Starmer was still engaged in the \u201cphoney war\u201d early stages of his attempt to refit Labour as a plausible government for the transformed 2020s political landscape. Now he has set his course. Even now, it may all have happened too late to undo the damage that the government inflicted on itself in the early months. Gray\u2019s departure, though, marks the moment when the pilot was dropped and the project decided to get serious.</p> <ul> <li><p>Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>",

Like it or not, it is the prime minister \u2013 in press interviews, in parliament and when the next election comes \u2013 who has to make the case for the government\u2019s departmental priorities. This is why, in part, it was Starmer himself who went to the Cop29 summit in Baku this week to announce new commitments to cleaner energy goals. No 10 believes that the government\u2019s big themes, on which its re-election hopes will depend, need to be led from Downing Street and by the prime minister himself. The decision to go to Baku directly reflects what has changed with Gray\u2019s departure. It will now be followed by others. Starmer has spent a lot of time abroad in the government\u2019s early months, largely because the diary required his attendance at a succession of international gatherings, of which next week\u2019s G20 summit in Brazil will be the next in a long line that started with the European political community summit at Blenheim Palace in July. Expect, though, before Christmas, to see Starmer starting to play a much more central role on domestic policy, too. There are at least two such events in the imminent Downing Street grid now. At least one of them is likely to involve making a case for NHS reforms of the kind that the health secretary, Wes Streeting, announced this week. This is the context in which stories suggesting the \u201creturn of the Blairites\u201d to Downing Street must be seen. For once, such tales are not exaggerations or scare stories. This time, they are simply true. The Blairites \u2013 or some of them \u2013 are indeed back. Their return does not embody a change of political direction for the Starmer government. More, it consolidates Starmer\u2019s willingness to grasp that Labour\u2019s project will not get far in the Trumpian 2020s unless it draws on experienced and politically savvy people who are willing to challenge shibboleths. The appointment of Tony Blair\u2019s former chief of staff Jonathan Powell as national security adviser from the start of December is the most eye-catching example of this. With Starmer refocusing on domestic policy, Powell is likely to carry a lot of the international heavy-lifting. But the return as director of policy delivery and innovation of Liz Lloyd, possessor of one of the driest senses of humour within the old Blair inner circle, is, if anything, more crucial. Most of the mission agenda will rest on her shoulders. None of this is to claim that Starmer\u2019s in-flight rebuilding of his governmental engine is without problems, still less that it will succeed. But it should be seen for what it is: as a very large change moment that makes coherent sense of Gray\u2019s departure. Back in the summer, Starmer was still engaged in the \u201cphoney war\u201d early stages of his attempt to refit Labour as a plausible government for the transformed 2020s political landscape. Now he has set his course. Even now, it may all have happened too late to undo the damage that the government inflicted on itself in the early months. Gray\u2019s departure, though, marks the moment when the pilot was dropped and the project decided to get serious. Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Good afternoon. Donald Trump\u2019s grip on the US government now appears all but absolute, after the Republican party secured a majority in the House of Representatives to complement its control of the Senate and right-leaning supreme court. The Associated Press determined Republicans had won at least 218 seats in the 435-member House after a victory in Arizona, a number which ends Democrats\u2019 hopes that the lower chamber could serve as a blockade against Trump\u2019s agenda. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s decision to nominate far-right loyalist Matt Gaetz as attorney general has sent shockwaves through Washington. The Florida congressman has been investigated at various times over alleged sex trafficking, sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and other ethical breaches, all of which he has denied. Trump also announced former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard as his director of national intelligence. Other loyalist picks such as hardliner Stephen Miller have fuelled fears of an extremist agenda. On the other side of US politics, progressive senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have called on Democrats to show the party stands ready to \u201cunrig this economy\u201d as Trump works with billionaires to overhaul it. Top news Samantha Murphy murder trial fast-tracked | Patrick Stephenson, 23, has pleaded not guilty to the murder of Ballarat woman Samantha Murphy, who went missing more than nine months ago, agreeing to waive a committal hearing and proceed directly to trial in the Victorian supreme court. NSW detective could face lesser charge over NorthConnex crash | A high-ranking detective who had allegedly consumed more than 20 drinks at a work function before crashing a police car could be acquitted of high-range drink-driving after \u201cfruitful\u201d negotiations between the prosecution and defence. Victorian year 12 exam \u2018cheat sheets\u2019 published online | Thousands of VCE students were given access to questions and answers almost identical to those used in final exams for subjects including specialist maths and legal studies, after the material was \u201cinadvertently included\u201d in sample cover sheets published online. Bali flights resume after volcanic eruptions | Qantas and Jetstar have resumed some flights between Bali and Australia, and Virgin was flying all scheduled flights, but many travellers remain stranded in Bali or have had their holidays cancelled after safety concerns from the 9km high ash cloud. Australia urged to match UK climate goal | Experts have urged the Albanese government to set an ambitious climate target that will quickly drive investment and create clean industries, after the UK pledged to cut emissions to 81% below 1990 levels by 2035 at the Cop29 summit. Palau president defeats brother-in-law in election | Surangel Whipps Jr has been returned for a second term leading the tiny Pacific nation, which is strategically important to the US military and one of the few remaining countries to diplomatically recognise Taiwan over China. UK court declares will written on food boxes valid | Malcolm Chenery, who died in 2021, left his estate, worth around \u00a3180,000 (A$352,000), to Diabetes UK. However, the charity faced a legal wrangle to inherit the donations, as Chenery\u2019s final wishes were written on two food packaging boxes that had contained frozen fish and mince pies. Jail term sought for Marine Le Pen | The Paris prosecutor has requested a five-year prison sentence and a five-year ban from public office for the far-right National Rally leader at a trial in which she and 24 others are accused of embezzling European Union funds.

With Israel facing no consequences for ignoring the US\u2019s deadline to increase aid to Gaza, the answer, according to cartoonist Fiona Katauskas, appears to be no. What they said \u2026 *** \u201cBanning YouTube would be the modern equivalent of banning children from libraries because there\u2019s a few books not suitable for children\u201d \u2013 Matt Canavan The Queensland senator has joined others from the left and right in expressing concern at the prospect of the social media ban for under-16s being rushed through parliament without a Senate inquiry. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said \u201clow-risk services\u201d such as YouTube Kids could be excluded from the ban, as well as Snapchat, which she suggested may be classified as a \u201cmessaging service\u201d. In numbers The number of people with diabetes has doubled over the past 30 years, according to a groundbreaking international study. Global analysis published in the Lancet found that rates of diabetes in adults doubled from about 7% to about 14% between 1990 to 2022, with the largest increase in low- and middle-income countries.

      "body": "<p>As a member of Gen Z, social media has shaped my life in more ways than I can count. Born just 10 months before Facebook launched in Australia, I\u2019ve grown up with every moment \u2013 from my first steps \u2013 shared on my mother\u2019s Facebook page. I\u2019ve never known a world without social media.

How can you go about getting rid of them? And what can you do to avoid them moving in to start with? Here, pest controllers share the secrets to an infestation-free life.</p> <h2>Be vigilant</h2> <p>Rodents and cockroaches are the most common callouts for the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nationalpestawards.co.uk/winners/\">pest controller of the year</a>, Josh Bates, who is based in Croydon and <a href=\"https://www.cleankill.co.uk/\">works for Cleankill</a>. \u201cLarge blocks of flats throw up challenges,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got so many people living under one roof, you are exposed to all sorts of things coming in. I\u2019ve had quite a few bad bedbug infestations recently.\u201d</p> <p>People who travel a lot are more susceptible to bedbugs, as there is a chance they can get into luggage and be carried on to public transport (although Bates is unconvinced that the London underground network is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/oct/10/bedbugs-real-source-concern-london-transport-sadiq-khan\">riddled with them</a>). </p> <p>Textile moths are a big problem in central London \u2013 Bates has seen them on trains in the city. They can cause costly damage: one couple in the capital are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/12/couple-sues-house-seller-for-36m-over-moth-infested-london-mansion\">suing the previous occupant of their home</a> for more than \u00a336m after claiming the house was \u201cinfested with millions of moths\u201d, resulting in damage to their clothes and property. Pests can strike at any time, regardless of your domestic circumstances. </p> <h2>Don\u2019t delay dealing with a problem</h2>    <p>If you need to get help, report the problem sooner rather than later, says Louise Chapman, AKA <a href=\"https://www.ladymolecatcher.co.uk/\">The Lady Mole Catcher</a>,<strong> </strong>who lives in Norwich and helps solve all kinds of pest problems around Norfolk. \u201cI had a guy phone me and he said: \u2018I\u2019ve got this mole \u2013 it\u2019s been here for three months.\u2019 I thought: \u2018Well, you should have called me three months ago; then I could have caught it.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Bates says: \u201cSome people hope that if they ignore the problem, the pests will go away. For instance, they might spot a few mouse droppings and get rid of them in the hope the mice won\u2019t come back. Inevitably, once rodents have found a way into your home and they start to breed, the problem will only get worse. The same goes for pests like clothes moths. If there is a little bit of damage somewhere, you probably have moths in other places in your property and they will multiply if you don\u2019t take action.\u201d</p> <h2>Tell your neighbours</h2> <p>Although it can feel embarrassing to share the news of a pest problem, it is a crucial step in getting rid of vermin once and for all, especially if you live in a flat or terrace house.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/02/you-go-to-a-job-and-its-absolutely-alive-with-rats-or-bedbugs-on-the-road-with-a-pest-controller\">\u2018You go to a job and it\u2019s absolutely alive with rats or bedbugs\u2019: on the road with a pest controller</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ian Furlong set up <a href=\"https://www.independentpestcontrol.co.uk/about-us/\">Independent Pest Control and Hygiene Services</a> in Liverpool in 2009. He says pests can easily run through the lofts of a whole terrace and get worse. \u201cThis is unless each property speaks to each other, which is what we encourage them to do,\u201d he says. </p> <p>There\u2019s no point in feeling shame about it. \u201cIt\u2019s not that you\u2019re dirty \u2013 it\u2019s just an environmental pest,\u201d Furlong says. Cockroaches spread like wildfire when people are living in close quarters, he adds, and are one of the hardest things to eradicate.</p> <h2>Basic housekeeping works</h2> <p>Pests can access even the most pristine palaces, but good housekeeping every day can eliminate the crumbs they might feed on, says Furlong. \u201cAnd rats have got to have water to survive. Any plant pots out in the garden that might not have plants in them, and people leave because they\u2019ve been too busy to move them, can fill up with water; it\u2019s an ideal source for rats.\u201d</p> <h2>Eliminate entry points</h2>    <p>\u201cLook for cracks and entry points to prevent pests from coming into the house,\u201d Bates says. \u201cMice can get through gaps of 6mm. The sort of cockroaches we have in the UK get in through tiny cracks and crevices, so it is important to fill in areas like that with sealant.\u201d</p> <p>Rats are incredibly good at getting into houses. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them chew a hole through a concrete kitchen floor,\u201d says Chapman, so they can easily chew through expanding foam. Furlong suggests filling any holes in your property with sturdier materials such as wire wool.</p> <p>Cluster flies are another problem. It is very difficult to stop them coming in, Chapman says: \u201cFlies can get through small cracks and they like a nice, warm loft space or a south-facing window.\u201d She once saw a 4ft clump of flies in a loft. You can try putting up fly tape, but Chapman tends to use an insecticide. She has <a href=\"https://www.buzz-off.co.uk/live-honey-bee-removal/\">another business removing bee colonies</a> and rehoming their inhabitants in her colleague\u2019s apiary.</p> <p>Ethically speaking, prevention is better than cure. \u201cPest controllers have the stigma of kill, kill, kill,\u201d says Kieron Bewes, a pest controller in east Devon. \u201cI am trying to get away from that and be more environmentally friendly.\u201d Bewes\u2019 business is called <a href=\"https://www.greenrockpestcontrol.co.uk/\">Green Rock</a> because, he says, \u201cI try to work with Mother Nature, not against her. I\u2019ll only use rodenticides as a last choice. I am a big fan of proofing.\u201d</p> <h2>Try a trap</h2> <p>\u201cI tell clients to try to save money by putting out a couple of traps themselves,\u201d says Furlong. \u201cBut you get people with a massive fear of them because if they trap something, they are not going to be able to deal with it. So they would rather pay.\u201d For some clients, he has to manage expectations that he is not \u201cthe old Pied Piper, where I\u2019m going to blow a whistle and everything is going to run away; it\u2019s not like that\u201d.</p> <p>Bates adds: \u201cAs professionals, we follow the code of responsible rodenticide use. So we are only going to use things if necessary and we\u2019re going to use them in a responsible way that is only going to target what we are trying to get rid of.\u201d</p> <h2>Avoid hoarding</h2> <p>All the pest controllers say their most challenging jobs have been at the homes of hoarders. \u201cIf someone\u2019s hoarding, there are lots of warm places for pests to sleep,\u201d says Furlong. Bates adds: \u201cRodents don\u2019t hibernate, so they are active all year round. We tend to get more callouts around this time of year as the temperature drops and the heating comes on. What the mice are after is basically somewhere warm to nest, with food.\u201d Furlong suggests keeping your belongings on shelves rather than on the floor.</p> <h2>Natural remedies are unlikely to leave you pest-free</h2>    <p>\u201cCedar wood balls might be advertised to keep away adult moths from your clothes, but it\u2019s the larvae that eat keratin and that\u2019s what causes damage to your clothes and carpets,\u201d says Bates. \u201cI\u2019ve been in a lot of flats and houses that stink of peppermint, which people have used to try to deter moths, and they\u2019ve still got a massive issue, so I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that is the best thing.\u201d</p> <h2>Cats don\u2019t always help</h2> <p>People often assume their feline friends will rid them of rodents. Quite the reverse: \u201cCats sometimes can be the cause of the problem,\u201d says Furlong, \u201cbecause they will carry things like mice in through the cat flap overnight when their owners are in bed,\u201d and these pests can make themselves at home before you\u2019re even aware.</p> <h2>Put dry foods in containers</h2> <p>Cereal boxes are ideal for rodents: they use the cardboard for nesting and \u201cinside they\u2019ve got their food source\u201d, says Bates. \u201cPut cereal in a sealed plastic container instead and keep things higher up, where mice are less likely to get in.\u201d If you have fruit flies, there will be a fermenting sugary substance somewhere, so deep clean and keep food in containers.</p> <h2>Be aware of bird feeders</h2> <p>\u201cI put bird feeders out that attract rats, mice and squirrels,\u201d admits Furlong. \u201cIf you notice a problem with rats, take the bird feeders away.\u201d If you are set on keeping your bird table, Bewes has a surprising trick to try to keep rodents at bay: \u201cNail a slinky toy on the post at the top, just under the table.\u201d If a rat tries to run up the post and grabs the bottom edge of the toy, its weight will drag down the coil and it will slide back to the bottom.<strong> </strong>\u201cIt is a really cheap and effective way of stopping them getting on a bird table.\u201d And always use premium fat balls, as they are less likely to crumble and fall on the floor, he says. Feeding pigeons is ill advised because they are a pain to get rid of and their <a href=\"https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/news/glasgow-news/mum-who-died-glasgow-hospital-30215266\">fouling can be hazardous</a>.</p> <p>Bates also stresses <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7-k4UYCgnCQ\">the appeal of bird feeders to squirrels</a>, which can cause all kinds of problems if they come inside: \u201cIf they get into a loft space, they can cause quite a lot of damage to the rafters.\u201d</p>    <p>Squirrels, however, are Bewes\u2019 favourite pest to deal with. \u201cThey are quite cheeky. They will stick their head up behind a box and look at you and wave, then disappear again. They are easy to catch because they are inquisitive, like mice. If you give them something to hide in, they will pop in there quite readily.\u201d Cutting back any overhanging trees near the house will prevent them accessing the property, he adds. And wisteria \u2013 though lovely \u2013 can also be problematic for helping give pests access, says Chapman.</p> <h2>If you discover rats, don\u2019t move a thing</h2> <p>It may sound counterintuitive, says Bewes, but, \u201cwith rodents, you want to leave stuff exactly as it is. Rats have neophobia, which is a fear of new things. If you start moving stuff around, they will be too scared to go into a trap. So you need to leave things absolutely where they are, which is very difficult if you\u2019re panicking because there\u2019s a rat in your kitchen and you want to remove the food source.\u201d</p> <h2>When buying secondhand furniture, check for bedbugs</h2> <p>Bedbugs don\u2019t limit themselves to beds. \u201cYou need to look for blood spots or brown blotches\u201d on all your furniture, advises Bewes. \u201cYou are also looking for the actual pest and where they have shed their skin. You want to really go through with a fine-tooth comb on the upholstery and underneath, too.\u201d </p> <h2>Put dog food away</h2>    <p>Put the dog\u2019s food and water bowl away at night, says Furlong. Rats are very resourceful creatures.</p> <h2>Keep compost and wood stacks well away</h2> <p>Compost is a difficult one, Bates says, as people want to do the right thing environmentally, but unfortunately a compost heap is \u201ca nice place for something like a rodent to burrow in, because you\u2019re providing a food source and it is warm\u201d. Keep compost heaps 6 metres (20ft) away from the property, if possible. The same goes for stacks of logs. \u201cRats have guard hairs and mice have whiskers that they use to navigate. So where you have things stacked, they actually feel quite safe.\u201d </p> <h2>Fully commit to eradication</h2> <p>If you employ a pest controller to get rid of bedbugs, you need to work with them, says Furlong. \u201cBecause we say: \u2018You\u2019ve got to empty all your rooms, you\u2019ve got to wash your clothes and your bedding at the hottest wash that you can.\u2019 But people say they haven\u2019t got time. So you can\u2019t guarantee that you\u2019re going to get rid of the problem.\u201d You don\u2019t necessarily have to get rid of your mattress, although people often do, \u201cbecause it makes them feel dirty\u201d.</p> <h2>Don\u2019t skimp on flea treatments for pets</h2> <p>\u201cOff-the-shelf flea treatments for pets are not as effective as if you get it from a vet,\u201d says Bewes. \u201cYes, the vet is more expensive, but not as expensive as a pest controller coming around to treat fleas.\u201d If you do have fleas, you need to do lots of vacuuming, he adds. \u201cThey have got different life cycles, so keep vacuuming them up. And remember to empty the bag. Don\u2019t just shove it in the closet, because they will all come out and you\u2019ve wasted your time.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "With reported rises in the number of rats and bedbugs, it is likely that many of us are sharing our living space with some pest or other. How can you go about getting rid of them? And what can you do to avoid them moving in to start with? Here, pest controllers share the secrets to an infestation-free life. Be vigilant Rodents and cockroaches are the most common callouts for the UK\u2019s pest controller of the year, Josh Bates, who is based in Croydon and works for Cleankill. \u201cLarge blocks of flats throw up challenges,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got so many people living under one roof, you are exposed to all sorts of things coming in. I\u2019ve had quite a few bad bedbug infestations recently.\u201d People who travel a lot are more susceptible to bedbugs, as there is a chance they can get into luggage and be carried on to public transport (although Bates is unconvinced that the London underground network is riddled with them). Textile moths are a big problem in central London \u2013 Bates has seen them on trains in the city. They can cause costly damage: one couple in the capital are suing the previous occupant of their home for more than \u00a336m after claiming the house was \u201cinfested with millions of moths\u201d, resulting in damage to their clothes and property. Pests can strike at any time, regardless of your domestic circumstances. Don\u2019t delay dealing with a problem If you need to get help, report the problem sooner rather than later, says Louise Chapman, AKA The Lady Mole Catcher, who lives in Norwich and helps solve all kinds of pest problems around Norfolk. \u201cI had a guy phone me and he said: \u2018I\u2019ve got this mole \u2013 it\u2019s been here for three months.\u2019 I thought: \u2018Well, you should have called me three months ago; then I could have caught it.\u2019\u201d Bates says: \u201cSome people hope that if they ignore the problem, the pests will go away. For instance, they might spot a few mouse droppings and get rid of them in the hope the mice won\u2019t come back. Inevitably, once rodents have found a way into your home and they start to breed, the problem will only get worse. The same goes for pests like clothes moths. If there is a little bit of damage somewhere, you probably have moths in other places in your property and they will multiply if you don\u2019t take action.\u201d Tell your neighbours Although it can feel embarrassing to share the news of a pest problem, it is a crucial step in getting rid of vermin once and for all, especially if you live in a flat or terrace house.

      "body": "<p>In the early hours of Wednesday morning last week, I sped down an empty motorway as rain pounded the asphalt, heading towards a Republican election-night party in the outskirts of Detroit. It was one of those storms that distorts your vision, where the lines of the road blur in slicks of water and the street lights refract through cascading droplets on the&nbsp;windscreen. The lonely roads and perilous weather&nbsp;felt like an apt backdrop. Donald Trump was&nbsp;about to be declared the next president of the United States.</p> \n<p>I went through the double doors and into the large, carpeted convention hall just seconds before Fox News called the race.

      "bodyText": "In the early hours of Wednesday morning last week, I sped down an empty motorway as rain pounded the asphalt, heading towards a Republican election-night party in the outskirts of Detroit. It was one of those storms that distorts your vision, where the lines of the road blur in slicks of water and the street lights refract through cascading droplets on the windscreen. The lonely roads and perilous weather felt like an apt backdrop. Donald Trump was about to be declared the next president of the United States. I went through the double doors and into the large, carpeted convention hall just seconds before Fox News called the race. The chatter began to dissipate as the crowd erupted, surging towards a stage at the back and waving large, black flags that read \u201cFix America Again\u201d. Elation and relief. Mayhem and incoherence. \u201cLock them up! Send them back! Jesus! Jesus!\u201d shouted one woman. Trump\u2019s second victory had been a foreseeable prospect since 13 February 2021, the day the US senate voted to acquit the disgraced former president after his second impeachment, thereby avoiding a decision on whether to bar him from holding office again. The chances were raised further by extensive delays and the amateurish handling of various criminal prosecutions instigated to hold him accountable for an assortment of criminal wrongdoing. But counterfactuals only take you so far in explaining this extended era of Trump. Chaos gets you a little further. As I looked around the room in the early hours, as men in red hats wept and embraced each other, the ideological inconsistencies of the expanded Make America Great Again (Maga) movement seemed stark.

      "body": "<p>Say Nothing could so easily be absolute chaos. It comprises at least seven narratives, jumping back and forth over four decades, with different actors playing older and younger versions of the same characters. But it has such a firm grasp of those characters \u2013 and of all its stories and the history against which they unfold \u2013 that you are never confused, only gripped throughout.</p> <p>This is not to say that the nine-part drama about the Troubles is without troubling aspects, but we will get to&nbsp;that. Based on the bestselling 2018 book of the same name by the New Yorker staff writer Patrick Radden Keefe, it opens with an abduction so cruel that it will become notorious \u2013 that of Jean McConville (played by Judith Roddy), a widowed mother of 10 in west Belfast. Rumoured to be an informant (although no evidence has been found that she was), she is bundled&nbsp;into a van&nbsp;by masked men in&nbsp;December 1972 and never seen&nbsp;alive again.</p> <p>In Dublin, 29 years later, Dolours Price (Maxine Peake) settles in front of a cassette recorder to make her contribution to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/24/ira-gunmen-face-arrest-boston-college-belfast-project-tapes\">the Belfast Project</a>: an oral history of the Troubles, gathered from those on the frontline of the murderous violence between Catholics and Protestants, Irish and British. In extended flashback&nbsp;\u2013 so extended that it makes up the bulk of the series \u2013 we&nbsp;see young Dolours (Lola Petticrew, doing fine work) growing up with her sister Marian (Hazel Doupe, doing equally fine work in a more subtle role) in a staunchly republican household.</p> <p>Their initial involvement with peaceful protest gradually evolves into what some would call fanaticism, but what her proud family consider to be commitment to the cause. She is recruited to the IRA by&nbsp;Gerry Adams (Josh Finan when young, Michael Colgan in later years, both quietly terrifying) and Brendan Hughes (Anthony Boyle, continuing his recent&nbsp;run of impeccable performances, then Tom Vaughan-Lawlor in his disillusioned middle age), the leader of the organisation\u2019s infamously brutal D&nbsp;company in the 70s.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If the subject matter of Say Nothing were fiction, it would be a fantastically entertaining and emotive thriller. But it isn\u2019t fiction</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s at this point that I should quote the disclaimer with which every episode of Say Nothing ends: Adams has always denied being a member of the IRA or&nbsp;participating in any IRA-related violence. Sometimes, this is expanded to include his denials of specific killings with which the episode has been&nbsp;concerned.</p> <p>If the subject matter of Say Nothing were fiction, it would be a fantastically entertaining and emotive thriller. Alliances are made and broken, people sacrifice&nbsp;themselves for a higher cause, engage in gunfights and riots, set bombs and make escapes (or&nbsp;not), survive awful prison experiences, then find their lives upended by a betrayal so vast and profound that not one of them sees it coming.</p> <p>But it isn\u2019t fiction. The high-water mark of Dolours\u2019 and Marian\u2019s careers is bombing the Old Bailey in March 1973, injuring more than 200 people.

      "bodyText": "Say Nothing could so easily be absolute chaos. It comprises at least seven narratives, jumping back and forth over four decades, with different actors playing older and younger versions of the same characters. But it has such a firm grasp of those characters \u2013 and of all its stories and the history against which they unfold \u2013 that you are never confused, only gripped throughout. This is not to say that the nine-part drama about the Troubles is without troubling aspects, but we will get to that. Based on the bestselling 2018 book of the same name by the New Yorker staff writer Patrick Radden Keefe, it opens with an abduction so cruel that it will become notorious \u2013 that of Jean McConville (played by Judith Roddy), a widowed mother of 10 in west Belfast. Rumoured to be an informant (although no evidence has been found that she was), she is bundled into a van by masked men in December 1972 and never seen alive again. In Dublin, 29 years later, Dolours Price (Maxine Peake) settles in front of a cassette recorder to make her contribution to the Belfast Project: an oral history of the Troubles, gathered from those on the frontline of the murderous violence between Catholics and Protestants, Irish and British. In extended flashback \u2013 so extended that it makes up the bulk of the series \u2013 we see young Dolours (Lola Petticrew, doing fine work) growing up with her sister Marian (Hazel Doupe, doing equally fine work in a more subtle role) in a staunchly republican household. Their initial involvement with peaceful protest gradually evolves into what some would call fanaticism, but what her proud family consider to be commitment to the cause. She is recruited to the IRA by Gerry Adams (Josh Finan when young, Michael Colgan in later years, both quietly terrifying) and Brendan Hughes (Anthony Boyle, continuing his recent run of impeccable performances, then Tom Vaughan-Lawlor in his disillusioned middle age), the leader of the organisation\u2019s infamously brutal D company in the 70s. It\u2019s at this point that I should quote the disclaimer with which every episode of Say Nothing ends: Adams has always denied being a member of the IRA or participating in any IRA-related violence. Sometimes, this is expanded to include his denials of specific killings with which the episode has been concerned. If the subject matter of Say Nothing were fiction, it would be a fantastically entertaining and emotive thriller. Alliances are made and broken, people sacrifice themselves for a higher cause, engage in gunfights and riots, set bombs and make escapes (or not), survive awful prison experiences, then find their lives upended by a betrayal so vast and profound that not one of them sees it coming. But it isn\u2019t fiction. The high-water mark of Dolours\u2019 and Marian\u2019s careers is bombing the Old Bailey in March 1973, injuring more than 200 people. They are sentenced to life imprisonment, reduced to 20 years, of which Dolours serves seven. The last third of the series concentrates on her life afterwards and the reckoning she and others have to make with that betrayal \u2013 Adams\u2019 decision to take part in the peace process and his political rise as the head of Sinn F\u00e9in, interspersed with stories about her activities as one of \u201cThe Unknowns\u201d, his special squad that took care of supposed \u201ctraitors\u201d, and brings us full circle to the opening scenes. It\u2019s a terrible story \u2013 many terrible stories \u2013 of a terrible time that is barely over. And it is a beautifully acted interrogation of the power of silence, the loyalty it proves and the burden it brings. However, it feels overly sympathetic to its main characters \u2013 the sisters, Hughes and Adams. The series darkens as it progresses, but the opening episodes \u2013 during which, for example, the girls\u2019 induction into the IRA is presented as a feminist triumph \u2013 do not focus sharply enough on the suffering inflicted by the central characters. Bar a few flashes of conscience from Dolours towards the end of her life, there is no reckoning with what they have done. And so, as the number of deaths and orphans created by their actions mounts, Say Nothing comes to feel as though it has left too much unsaid. \u2022 Say Nothing is on Disney+",

      "bodyText": "Israel is using evacuation orders to pursue the \u201cdeliberate and massive forced displacement\u201d of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, according to a report by Human Rights Watch, which says the policy amounts to crimes against humanity. The US-based group added it had collected evidence that suggested \u201cthe war crime of forcible transfer [of the civilian population]\u201d, describing it as \u201ca grave breach of the Geneva conventions and a crime under the Rome statute of the international criminal court\u201d. The report was published amid mounting evidence that Israel is accelerating its efforts to cut the Gaza Strip in two with a buffer zone and is building new infrastructure to support a prolonged military presence, with an increased pace of demolitions and destruction. Residents in northern Gaza said Israeli forces were besieging displaced families and the remaining population, which some estimated at a few thousand, ordering them to head south through a checkpoint separating two towns and a refugee camp from Gaza City. Men were held for questioning, while women and children were allowed to continue towards Gaza City, residents and Palestinian medics said. Calling for Israel\u2019s policy of forced displacement to be investigated by the international criminal court, Human Rights Watch also urged targeted sanctions against Israel including the cessation of arms sales. The report by the prominent international rights group, titled \u2018Hopeless, Starving, and Besieged\u2019: Israel\u2019s Forced Displacement of Palestinians in Gaza, takes aim at one of Israel\u2019s most controversial policies: the use of evacuation orders, which have driven mass displacement inside Gaza, with many people being displaced on multiple occasions. That has led to the displacement of more than 90% of the population \u2013 1.9 million Palestinians \u2013 and the widespread destruction of much of Gaza over the last 13 months. The HRW report is in stark contrast to the assessment by the US state department earlier this week that Israel had not breached American laws on blocking aid supplies after the lapse of a 30-day deadline it gave Israel to boost humanitarian aid access in Gaza or risk having some military assistance cut off. The fourth Geneva convention stipulates that in territory occupied by a belligerent, displacement of civilians must only occur in exceptional circumstances for \u201cimperative military reasons\u201d or for the population\u2019s security and requires safeguards and proper accommodation to receive displaced civilians. The UN\u2019s guiding principles on internal displacement also state that, in all circumstances parties to conflict must \u201cprevent and avoid conditions that might lead to displacement of persons\u201d. Despite those conditions, Israel has repeatedly used evacuation orders \u2013 in Lebanon as well as Gaza \u2013 to forcibly displace civilians even though that the evacuation orders have no legal status. While Israeli leaders and the Israel Defense Forces have justified the use of the evacuation orders, arguing that their use demonstrates Israel\u2019s adherence to protecting civilians in wartime, the group says that they have instead harmed Palestinians. \u201cIsrael claims that the displacement of nearly all of Gaza\u2019s population has been justified for the security of the population and for imperative military reasons, and it has taken the requisite steps to safeguard civilians,\u201d says the report. \u201cBecause Palestinian armed groups are fighting from among the civilian population, Israeli officials claim, the military has evacuated civilians to enable it to target fighters and destroy the groups\u2019 infrastructure, such as tunnels while limiting harm to civilians, such that the mass displacements were lawful. \u201c[But] rather than ensuring civilians\u2019 security, military \u201cevacuation orders\u201d have caused grave harm,\u201d the report finds. \u201cDemonstrably, Israel has not evacuated Palestinian civilians in Gaza for their security, as they have not been secure during evacuations or on arrival at designated safe zones. Nor has Israel convincingly claimed that it had a military imperative for forcing most Palestinian civilians from their homes.\u201d Under international law, Israel \u2013 as the occupying power in Gaza \u2013 is under a legal obligation to facilitate the return of displaced persons to their homes in areas where hostilities have ceased. Instead, the reports say, Israel has \u201crendered large areas of Gaza uninhabitable\u201d by carrying out demolitions, intentionally destroying or severely damaging civilian infrastructure, including schools and religious and cultural institutions, including after hostilities had largely ceased in an area. HRW added that the permanent displacement of civilians to create military buffer zones within the Gaza Strip would also amount to ethnic cleansing. According to a report in the leftwing Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Israeli forces in Gaza are clearing large areas with the apparent intention to remain inside the territory until at least the end of 2025. The newspaper reported that a \u201ccombat graph for 2025\u201d distributed in recent weeks to Israeli soldiers and commanders in Gaza describes \u201cexposing large areas\u201d in the coastal strip: destroying existing buildings and infrastructure in addition to the construction of roads and preparations for building more permanent military facilities. Nadia Hardman, refugee and migrant rights researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: \u201cThe Israeli government cannot claim to be keeping Palestinians safe when it kills them along escape routes, bombs so-called safe zones, and cuts off food, water, and sanitation. \u201cIsrael has blatantly violated its obligation to ensure Palestinians can return home, razing virtually everything in large areas.\u201d The Guardian emailed the Israeli military for comment. Israel\u2019s campaign in the north of Gaza, and the evacuation of tens of thousands of Palestinians from the area, have fuelled claims from Palestinians that it is clearing the area for use as a buffer zone and potentially for a return of Jewish settlers. \u201cThe scenes of the 1948 catastrophe are being repeated. Israel is repeating its massacres, displacement and destruction,\u201d said Saed, 48, a resident of Beit Lahiya, who arrived in Gaza City on Wednesday. \u201cNorth Gaza is being turned into a large buffer zone; Israel is carrying out ethnic cleansing under the sight and hearing of the impotent world,\u201d he told Reuters via a chat app. Saed was referring to the 1948 Middle East Arab-Israeli war, which gave birth to the state of Israel and saw the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their home towns and villages. The Israeli military has denied any such intention, and the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said he does not want to reverse the 2005 withdrawal of settlers from Gaza. But hardliners in his government have talked openly about going back. Israeli airstrikes pounded Beirut\u2019s Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs for a second consecutive day on Wednesday, as Lebanon waited to hear Washington\u2019s latest ceasefire proposals after a US official expressed hope a truce could be reached. More than seven weeks after Israel went on the offensive against Iran-backed Hezbollah, its latest airstrikes levelled half a dozen buildings in the Beirut suburb known as Dahiyeh and killed six people in a village south of the capital.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s election is a triumph for the politics of the doomsday bunker, which is bad news for the world\u2019s environment. This is the idea that in an age of climate disruption, nature extinction and ever wider social inequality, the best chance of survival for those who can afford it is to construct a personal shelter, where they can keep the desperate masses at bay. It is survival of the richest. Apocalyptic thinking like this may once have been the stuff of science fiction but it has been normalised by billionaires such as the Palantir founder, Peter Thiel, Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg and others who have been building underground bunkers or buying superyachts and private jets to whisk themselves away to remote islands. Tech billionaires were instrumental in Trump\u2019s victory, particularly the Tesla boss, Elon Musk, who poured millions into the campaign and used X as a loudspeaker, and Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, whose newspaper, the Washington Post, blocked its editorial staff from endorsing Kamala Harris. Once you get into a bunker mindset, you become invested in apocalypse. Out goes any idea of looking for solutions to the cause of the world\u2019s problems, and in comes the idea that you survive by amassing wealth and weapons, throwing up higher walls and asset-stripping the wasteland outside. From the perspective of the global south, such thinking in the most powerful country on Earth is a disaster. Survival in the Amazon rainforest, where I live, or the African savannah or the flood plains of Asia depends on a stable climate, abundant nature and peaceful cooperation. The first Trump administration diminished environmental protections. Trump 2 has the capacity to take this to a new level because there are fewer constraints. Voters have given Trump the authority of an emperor. This is cause for multiple alarms, not least a US exit from the global climate fight. Polls suggest this was not high in the minds of most voters, and the climate and nature crisis barely featured in election debates and speeches. But the climate created the setting for Trump\u2019s economy-first win: the devastating impacts of hurricanes such as Helene and Milton making the federal government seem impotent, droughts worldwide adding to food price inflation, and higher temperatures everywhere creating more stress and foreboding.

Rich countries also want petrostates and large emerging economies with high greenhouse gas emissions, such as China, to contribute. Early drafts of a possible agreement have shown that countries are far apart on key issues.</p> <p>Harjeet Singh, climate activist and global engagement director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, said: \u201cReport after report, including this one, makes it undeniable: we need trillions each year to transform economies and tackle escalating climate impacts, and the cost of inaction will be exponentially higher. Yet leaders from wealthy nations continue to bury their heads in the sand, sidestepping the essential funding that developing countries need and ignoring the fact that a just, global transition is our only path forward.</p> <p>\u201cIf Cop29 fails to set a meaningful climate finance goal \u2013 real trillions in grants, not accounting tricks \u2013 we\u2019re all on the losing side.

Under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, rich countries have an obligation to the poor world and this year must come up with a \u201cnew collective quantified goal\u201d (NCQG) setting out how they will meet their responsibilities. Richer countries agree they should provide some money, but want to make up a large part of the goal with finance from the private sector. Some countries are advocating new taxes or levies to provide part of the money needed. Rich countries also want petrostates and large emerging economies with high greenhouse gas emissions, such as China, to contribute. Early drafts of a possible agreement have shown that countries are far apart on key issues. Harjeet Singh, climate activist and global engagement director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, said: \u201cReport after report, including this one, makes it undeniable: we need trillions each year to transform economies and tackle escalating climate impacts, and the cost of inaction will be exponentially higher. Yet leaders from wealthy nations continue to bury their heads in the sand, sidestepping the essential funding that developing countries need and ignoring the fact that a just, global transition is our only path forward. \u201cIf Cop29 fails to set a meaningful climate finance goal \u2013 real trillions in grants, not accounting tricks \u2013 we\u2019re all on the losing side. Climate devastation is already an everyday reality, and every delay only deepens the crisis for everyone.\u201d Yalchin Rafiyev, the host country\u2019s lead negotiator, whose job it is to find compromises among the fractious governments, told the Guardian the talks were moving much as expected at this early stage. \u201cWe are making progress,\u201d he said. The talks were lifted by an announcement from the World Bank and its fellow multilateral development banks of a doubling of their key climate finance commitments, to $120bn a year by 2030. Rafiyev said: \u201cWe have been working very hard to push development banks for more funding. This is a strong commitment.\u201d But one high-level executive from a public finance institution told the Guardian this sum was not enough: \u201cthey could do more\u201d.",

Against the backdrop of Russia\u2019s strict anti-drug regime and geopolitical isolation, a powerful darknet drug industry has developed. Fronted by lavish websites, Hollywood-quality promotional videos and audacious PR stunts on Moscow\u2019s streets, it now dominates the trade from production to sale \u2013 and is taking root outside Russia, from the battlefields of Ukraine to the streets of Tbilisi and Seoul.</p> \n<p>At the bottom is a conveyor belt of poorly paid Russians looking for a financial shortcut amid low prospects and high inflation.

The high risk of buying and selling drugs in Russia, both on the streets and via its unreliable, heavily monitored postal system, led to a new system cloaked by a layer of anonymity.

So at first this system of dead drops created a sense of security.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is a model that has spread to Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, where Russian soldiers use Telegram channels and dead drops to buy drugs. A month after the fall of Mariupol, a shop called CaifCoin was searching for <em>kladmen</em> in Mariupol and another called Republic started giving out free samples via dead drops in occupied Kherson. Shops operating in occupied parts of Ukraine offered subscribers about 18,000 rubles (\u00a3140, $180) to beat up errant couriers.</p> \n<p>The spread of the Russian model is most pronounced in neighbouring countries, but in June 2023 South Korea\u2019s president, Yoon Suk Yeol, declared an \u201call-out war\u201d on online drug vendors using dead drops after hundreds of arrests, and after a 14-year-old girl was found slumped in a public bathroom after allegedly using cryptocurrency to buy crystal meth.</p> \n<p>The longest-running darknet platform, Hydra, made $1.7bn in 2021 from 17 million customers. Operating as a monopoly, it was also an international hub for money laundering and hacking until German police found its 55 servers near Frankfurt and shut it down. Four new darknet platforms \u2013 Mega, Kraken, OMG! OMG! and Blacksprut \u2013 now battle for customers far out of the shadows. In March, a bus pumping out electronic music emblazoned with Kraken\u2019s logo and a QR code to buy drugs was used to block one of Moscow\u2019s busiest streets.

Many online shops employ enforcers, known as \u201csportsmen\u201d, to find and punish <em>kladmen</em> with bad reviews from buyers who could not find their drugs, or those who are suspected of stealing. The poorer couriers are easily traced because those who could not afford the deposit needed to get the job have to provide an ID card.</p> \n<p>These brutal attacks are often filmed and uploaded to social media \u2013 some Telegram groups have posted up to 2,000 clips \u2013 as victims are forced to beg for forgiveness. It is routine to see people beaten unconscious, while the most extreme videos feature fingers being broken or cut off, sexual assault and, in at least one case, murder.</p> \n<p>\u201cThose running Russia\u2019s drug trade, the big darknet markets, now have unique control over the drug trade and the drugs people are most likely to buy,\u201d said the report. \u201cDarknet markets should not be understood simply as online markets, but as a criminal ecosystem shaping drug use, distribution and production trends across Russia and across an increasing number of countries on Russia\u2019s border.\u201d</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Max Daly is co-author of <a href=\"https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/russia-drug-trade-organized-crime/\">Breaking Klad: Russia\u2019s Dead Drop Drug Revolution</a>, published by the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC)</em></p></li> \n</ul>",

The spread of the Russian model is most pronounced in neighbouring countries, but in June 2023 South Korea\u2019s president, Yoon Suk Yeol, declared an \u201call-out war\u201d on online drug vendors using dead drops after hundreds of arrests, and after a 14-year-old girl was found slumped in a public bathroom after allegedly using cryptocurrency to buy crystal meth. The longest-running darknet platform, Hydra, made $1.7bn in 2021 from 17 million customers. Operating as a monopoly, it was also an international hub for money laundering and hacking until German police found its 55 servers near Frankfurt and shut it down. Four new darknet platforms \u2013 Mega, Kraken, OMG! OMG! and Blacksprut \u2013 now battle for customers far out of the shadows. In March, a bus pumping out electronic music emblazoned with Kraken\u2019s logo and a QR code to buy drugs was used to block one of Moscow\u2019s busiest streets. A year before, a huge electronic billboard promoting Blacksprut showed a woman in a futuristic mask and the words: \u201cCome to me if you\u2019re looking for the best.\u201d \u201cMoriarty\u201d, the masked figurehead of the largest darknet market, Mega, regularly taunts the Russian authorities, who have failed to arrest the masterminds, while updating his 2.8 million followers with red pill-style videos on masculinity and how to get rich on the drug trade. Like most drug underworlds, the industry is shot through with brutality. Many online shops employ enforcers, known as \u201csportsmen\u201d, to find and punish kladmen with bad reviews from buyers who could not find their drugs, or those who are suspected of stealing. The poorer couriers are easily traced because those who could not afford the deposit needed to get the job have to provide an ID card. These brutal attacks are often filmed and uploaded to social media \u2013 some Telegram groups have posted up to 2,000 clips \u2013 as victims are forced to beg for forgiveness. It is routine to see people beaten unconscious, while the most extreme videos feature fingers being broken or cut off, sexual assault and, in at least one case, murder. \u201cThose running Russia\u2019s drug trade, the big darknet markets, now have unique control over the drug trade and the drugs people are most likely to buy,\u201d said the report. \u201cDarknet markets should not be understood simply as online markets, but as a criminal ecosystem shaping drug use, distribution and production trends across Russia and across an increasing number of countries on Russia\u2019s border.\u201d Max Daly is co-author of Breaking Klad: Russia\u2019s Dead Drop Drug Revolution, published by the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC)",

Darwin, where smoke from savanna fires was a major source of air pollution, was a \u201ccase in point\u201d, she said. \u201cThe EPA have monitored air quality in Darwin for 20 years, as environmental agencies do all around the country,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cConsistently over that time, Darwin has had the worst air quality in Australia.\u201d From Funafuti in Tuvalu (first) to Shanghai in China (393rd), Auto Trader ranked cities based on an \u201cair quality index\u201d score, reflecting concentrations of hazardous air particles, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide, collected from Open Weather Map data at twice a year over a three-year period. Sydney (150th) was the worst-ranked Australian city, recording a poorer air pollution score than London (90th), which Johnston said was also incorrect. \u201cSydney has never been worse than London, on empirical data,\u201d she said, adding that local measurements over time analysed by experts in the field provided more meaningful results than \u201ca global model that got interpreted by car salesmen\u201d. Clare Walter, a public health and air pollution researcher based at the University of Melbourne, warned against complacency. \u201cAir pollution impacts our health, at any level,\u201d she said. Asthma, lung cancer, respiratory infections, diabetes, stroke and heart disease had all been linked to the problem. \u201cAir pollution gets into our blood stream. It causes systemic inflammation. When your body is under stress, in an inflamed state, it can lead to a very wide range of health impacts.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Vehicle emissions were the main source of chronic air pollution in Australian cities, she said. Wood heaters also make a substantial contribution in some cities, particularly during winter. Walter said Melbourne\u2019s inner west was subject to high levels of air pollution, largely due to diesel trucks travelling between the port and container yards. Melbourne (52nd) recorded a similar score to US cities Miami and Texas, whereas Perth (95th) and Brisbane (96th) had similar levels of air pollution to Pittsburgh. While a blanket rating might drive some cities to try to improve, the narrative that \u201cair quality is good in Australia\u201d was a barrier to changes required for improvement, Walter said. Dr Kate Charlesworth, a public health physician and Climate Council health expert, agreed. \u201cAustralians tend to think we have pretty good air quality, but when you look at the air pollution in the places where we spend a lot of time, the levels are actually quite concerning,\u201d she said. A previous report by the Australian Conservation Foundation found towns outside capital cities that had large mining operations or power stations were the worst locations for air quality. A recent Climate Council report found one in six childcare centres and schools nationally were within 100 metres of a busy road. That exposure was a concern, Charlesworth said, given children could be spending up to seven hours a day at school, and up to 10 hours at childcare, and were most at risk from the health impacts of air pollution, particularly asthma, respiratory infections and developmental delays. \u201cWe\u2019re now understanding just how harmful that can be in the longer term,\u201d she said. The Global Burden of Disease Study showed in 2021 that air pollution caused more ill health in children than passive smoking, Charlesworth said. Gains could be achieved relatively quickly, she said, through a combination of anti-idling policies, clean air zones, supporting walking and cycling to school and public transport. Stronger fuel efficiency standards and the increased uptake of electric vehicles would also help. \u201cYou can\u2019t move schools and childcare centres, but you can clean up the air,\u201d Charlesworth said. Erin Baker, a director at Auto Trader, said: \u201cWe hope this study inspires both individuals and policymakers to take steps towards improving air quality in all our cities, making them healthier for everyone.\u201d According to the report, Hobart\u2019s high ranking reflected the city\u2019s proximity to the ocean, small population and less traffic, while places like Bilbao in Spain had achieved lower pollution through high public transport use and shifting taxi, delivery and council fleets to electric vehicles. In London, phasing out diesel vehicles and introducing the ultra-low emissions zone and initiatives to make school streets safer had been associated with reduced asthma-related emergency department attendance, Walter said. In Australian cities, anti-idling policies, wood heater restrictions in urban environments and prioritising active and public transport could all dramatically reduce air pollution and improve public health, she said. \u201cThere are lots of things we could and should be doing.\u201d",

While US courts have affirmed that presidents have much leeway when it comes to setting immigration policies, Trump will need Congress to appropriate extensive funds to carry out such a massive deportation operation.</p> <p>In a worrying sign for immigrant rights advocates, Trump said after his victory on Tuesday that his deportation program would have \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/08/trump-mass-deportation-plan\">no price tag</a>\u201d, doubling down on his commitment to the project.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of a price tag.

      "bodyText": "With the confirmation that Republicans have won a majority in the House of Representatives, Donald Trump and his party will now have a governing trifecta in Washington come January, giving the new president a powerful perch to enact his rightwing agenda. Even without majorities in both chambers of Congress, Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential race already gave him significant control over US foreign policy and the makeup of the federal government, both of which he is seeking to overhaul. But a Republican trifecta in Washington will give Trump much more sweeping authority to implement his legislative priorities. As the Guardian has outlined through the Stakes project, Trump\u2019s plans include extending tax cuts, rolling back landmark laws signed by Joe Biden and advancing a conservative cultural agenda. One of Republicans\u2019 most oft-repeated campaign promises is that they will extend the tax cuts Trump signed into law in 2017, many of which are set to expire at the end of 2025. An analysis from the non-partisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that making the tax cuts permanent would cost $288.5bn in 2026 alone and disproportionately benefit the highest-income households. The highest-income 20% of Americans would receive nearly two-thirds of that tax benefit, compared with just 1% for the lowest-income 20% of Americans. Perhaps the most haunting possibility for Democrats is that Republicans would use their governing trifecta in Washington to enact a nationwide abortion ban. Trump has said he would veto such a policy, but his repeated flip-flopping on the issue has raised questions about that claim. Research has shown that existing abortion bans have forced doctors to provide substandard medical care, and they have been blamed for the deaths of at least four women: Josseli Barnica, Nevaeh Crain, Candi Miller and Amber Thurman. With majorities in both chambers, Republicans could also allocate vast resources to assist Trump\u2019s plan to deport millions of undocumented migrants, which became a central plank of his re-election platform. While US courts have affirmed that presidents have much leeway when it comes to setting immigration policies, Trump will need Congress to appropriate extensive funds to carry out such a massive deportation operation. In a worrying sign for immigrant rights advocates, Trump said after his victory on Tuesday that his deportation program would have \u201cno price tag\u201d, doubling down on his commitment to the project. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of a price tag. It\u2019s not \u2013 really, we have no choice,\u201d Trump told NBC News. \u201cWhen people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries, and now they\u2019re going to go back to those countries because they\u2019re not staying here.\u201d In addition to advancing Trump\u2019s platform, Republicans would almost certainly be looking to unravel key portions of Biden\u2019s legacy, including the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA marked the country\u2019s most significant response yet to the climate crisis and has spurred significant energy-related investments in many districts, prompting some Republicans to suggest that Congress should preserve some of the law\u2019s provisions while repealing others. That quandary reflects a potential problem for Republicans in full control of Congress: what will they do with the Affordable Care Act (ACA)? When Republicans last held a governing trifecta, during Trump\u2019s first two years in office, they tried and failed to repeal and replace the ACA. The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, recently suggested that there would be \u201cno Obamacare\u201d if his party won full control of Congress, according to a video published by NBC News. But he seemed to caveat that statement by telling supporters: \u201cThe ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\u201d In recent years, both parties have experienced the pains of governing with narrow majorities, and those problems could reappear in the new Congress. During Biden\u2019s first two years in office, his legislative proposals were repeatedly blocked in the Senate despite Democrats holding a majority because of the concerns of two centrist members of their caucus, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. When Republicans held a 52-48 majority in the Senate in 2017, they still failed to repeal and replace the ACA because three members of their conference opposed the proposal. Two of those members \u2013 Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2013 are still in the Senate today and may be resistant to various components of Trump\u2019s agenda, particularly a potential abortion ban. And although Republicans have won the House, their narrow majority could exacerbate issues that played out in the last session of Congress, when the conference\u2019s inner turmoil repeatedly brought the chamber to a standstill. Johnson will have to corral a fractious conference that has repeatedly clashed over government funding, foreign aid and the debt ceiling.

      "bodyText": "Republicans have secured a majority in the US House of Representatives, extending their hold on the lower chamber and delivering a governing trifecta in Washington that could give Donald Trump sweeping power to enact his legislative agenda. The Associated Press determined on Wednesday evening that Republicans had won at least 218 seats in the 435-member House after a victory in Arizona, a call that came more than a week after polls closed across the US and as Trump made cabinet announcements that sent shockwaves through Washington. The call ensures Republicans will continue to have a large say in key matters such as government funding, debt ceiling negotiations and foreign aid, and it spells an end to Democrats\u2019 hopes that the lower chamber could serve as a blockade against Trump\u2019s agenda. Republicans had already won the White House and regained a majority in the Senate, so their victory in the House provides them with the last component of their governing trifecta. Although they will have a slim majority, Republicans have indicated they will use their trifecta to maximum effect when the new Congress is seated in January. \u201cWe have to deliver for the people, and we will,\u201d the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, told Fox News last week. \u201cPresident Trump wants to be aggressive. He wants to go big and we\u2019re excited about that. We\u2019re going to get to play offense.\u201d Trump\u2019s selection of at least three House Republicans to join his administration further complicates the math for Johnson. Trump had already tapped the New York representative Elise Stefanik to serve as ambassador to the United Nations and Mike Waltz, the Florida representative, to fill the role of national security adviser. On Wednesday, Trump announced he would also nominate Matt Gaetz, the Republican congressman of Florida, as his attorney general. A rightwing firebrand, Gaetz was a thorn in the side of former House speaker Kevin McCarthy, eventually leading the successful charge to oust McCarthy from his role. Reaction to Gaetz\u2019s nomination ranged from puzzled to outraged, even from members of the president-elect\u2019s own party. Despite the increasingly narrow majority, Johnson brushed off concerns about how Trump\u2019s picks might affect House Republicans\u2019 ability to legislate. \u201cWe have an embarrassment of riches,\u201d Johnson said on Tuesday. \u201cWe have a really talented Republican conference. We\u2019ve got really competent, capable people here. Many of them could serve in really important positions in the new administration, but President Trump fully understands and appreciates the math here, and it\u2019s just a numbers game.\u201d Democrats unsuccessfully campaigned on a need to curtail the current \u201cdysfunction\u201d in Congress, after Republicans\u2019 narrow majority repeatedly brought the House to a standstill. When Republicans took control of the House in January 2023, it took 15 rounds of voting to elect Kevin McCarthy as speaker, as roughly 20 hard-right members withheld support from their conference\u2019s nominee. Nine months later, McCarthy was ousted after eight of his Republican colleagues voted with House Democrats to remove him as speaker. After McCarthy\u2019s departure, Johnson, then a relatively unknown Republican member from Louisiana, ascended to the speakership following a tumultuous election. Over the past year, Johnson stretched himself thin to appease members of his ideologically diverse conference. His efforts fell short for some, including Marjorie Taylor Greene, a hard-right member from Georgia. Greene attempted to oust Johnson as speaker in May, but that resolution was easily quashed by a chamber seemingly exhausted by the turmoil that defined this session of Congress. Despite those hurdles, Republicans were able to keep their hold on the House and on Wednesday, Johnson won the Republican nomination to stay in the job as speaker and is on track to keep the gavel after a full House vote in the new year. Trump gave Johnson a welcome boost during a meeting with House Republicans in Washington, when he endorsed the speaker\u2019s bid to extend his tenure and indicated that Johnson has his full support. Johnson returned the praise by celebrating Trump as a \u201csingular figure in American history\u201d. \u201cThey used to call Bill Clinton the comeback kid,\u201d Johnson said. \u201c[Trump] is the comeback king.\u201d Although Democrats fell short in their campaign to flip the House, they touted the party\u2019s ability to mitigate its losses in a difficult national environment.

      "bodyText": "One of the biggest superannuation funds in the country responsible for $94bn in retirement savings has been accused of failing its members at their most vulnerable time and causing undue hardship. The scandal \u2013 which Cbus has apologised for \u2013 has intensified scrutiny on the $3.9tn superannuation industry, with regulators warning other funds may be at fault too. What has happened at Cbus? Cbus has admitted to lengthy delays in processing its members\u2019 claims for death and disability payments. These are lump sum payments that members were entitled to. These delays caused financial hardship for grieving families who needed the money to clear debts or pay bills after losing an income earner. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) has lodged federal court proceedings that allege Cbus failed to process more than 10,000 of these claims within 90 days. More than 6,000 members had to wait more than 12 months for payments. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Asic alleges Cbus \u201cfailed to act efficiently, honestly and fairly in the handling of claims for death benefits and total and permanent disablement insurance\u201d. It has accused Cbus of failing its members \u201cat their most vulnerable time\u201d. Cbus is yet to file a defence in court. What does Cbus say? The industry fund admits it let its members down, causing them unnecessary distress at difficult times. The fund says there was no intention to withhold money from its members and has highlighted outsourcing as an issue. Cbus\u2019 chief executive, Kristian Fok, told a Senate inquiry on Thursday that he was \u201csorry for the impact that delays in processing insurance claims have had on our members and our families\u201d. \u201cWe are committed to doing better, and we will,\u201d Fok said. \u201cMany of our members have high-risk jobs where injury and deaths are more common. We know that delays in processing claims can add to their distress at a difficult time.\u201d Fok said about 80% of the more than 7,000 claims subject to Asic litigation have been cleared. Cbus has established a compensation fund for affected members and says it is cooperating with Asic. How did these delays affect Cbus members? ASIC\u2019s deputy chair, Sarah Court, believes these delays have caused \u201creal harm to families who may be relying on the payments to meet critical expenses\u201d. \u201cThis adds to difficult personal circumstances, whether grieving for a loved one or dealing with severe injury or illness,\u201d Court said in a statement earlier this week. \u201cThe additional anxiety and pain these delays caused compounded the issues these members and their families faced.\u201d The amount of payments subject to delays was around $20m. Will Cbus members pay for any enforcement penalty? Potentially. If Asic\u2019s claims are upheld, Cbus could face a fine of up to $49m. The regulator has acknowledged members could be forced to pay for some of that fine and wants this to be considered by the court. On Thursday, the Liberal senator Andrew Bragg asked Fok whether members could be on the hook for a regulatory fine. \u201cLook, I am not going to speculate on that,\u201d Fok replied. \u201cAs you know, speculation on that before we have even had the ability to look at the full detail is not going to be helpful.\u201d Bragg told Guardian Australia that Fok should have ruled out making members contribute to any regulator fine. \u201cMembers should not pay for the sins of trustees,\u201d he said. What are death benefits and disability payments? Members pay premiums for death cover to ensure that when they die, their family members can receive a lump sum. \u201cThis coverage provides reassurance, knowing your loved ones and dependants will have financial support if you die,\u201d the Cbus website says. Total and permanent disablement cover works in a similar way. If a member is injured or becomes so unwell they are unlikely to ever work again, a member receives a lump sum payment. Does this affect other funds? Court, Asic\u2019s deputy chair, said the regulator believed there were \u201cwidespread customer service failings on death and disability claims across the super industry\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that we do think this is a broader, industry issue,\u201d Court said. \u201cWe are doing a deep dive surveillance of superannuation trustees\u2019 handling of death benefits claims more broadly.\u201d The watchdog has lodged court action to send a message to all funds that these type of delays \u2013 whether intentional or not \u2013 are unacceptable. Asic is also writing to the chief executives of several funds about its concerns, with a report on their conduct due early next year. \u201cWe may well have further enforcement action to follow,\u201d Court said. What is industry super? Most industry super funds were established by trade unions to manage the retirement savings of workers in particular industries. The Construction and Building Unions Superannuation (Cbus) is open to all Australians and is one of the country\u2019s largest funds. But it does appeal directly to workers in that industry and tailor its services to them. Cbus has a mutual fund structure, which means all profits are retained for members. Unlike retail super funds, it does not pay dividends or profits to shareholders. What does the government say? So far, the government\u2019s response has been relatively muted. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has said it was \u201creally important regulators do this work\u201d. \u201cThose allegations are now before the courts, and the standard practice, which I\u2019m adhering to today, is that we don\u2019t comment on matters before the court. \u201cBut I\u2019m a strong supporter of our regulators, and when they find issues that concern them, they should test them, which is what they\u2019re doing now.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The AFLW\u2019s emerging powers meet this weekend in a finals clash that serves as a symbol for the league\u2019s maturity, and is amplified by a heated all-in shoving match last week that is still being investigated by the AFL. Hawthorn host Port Adelaide on Saturday night in an elimination semi-final at Ikon Park, as two of the league\u2019s newcomers chase glory in their first finals appearances. Both teams joined the competition in its final phase of expansion in 2022 and neither had made the eight until this season. While minor premiers North Melbourne and defending premiers Brisbane \u2013 who beat Hawthorn in a tense affair on Sunday \u2013 remain the favourites for the competition, these two upstarts have been the competition\u2019s major movers in 2024 and loom as genuine premiership threats. Some had accused Hawthorn \u2013 who finished the 11-game home-and-away season in second place \u2013 of having benefited from a weak draw, but they proved their credentials in pushing the Lions to the brink on Sunday, and were within a kick of their opponents when the siren sounded \u2013 and the argy bargy began. It involved around a dozen players who had to be separated and is reportedly still being reviewed by the AFL\u2019s integrity unit. Hawks vice-captain Eliza West said on Thursday \u201csomething happened involving a player\u201d but \u201cwe\u2019ll let people who know how to deal with that, deal with that, and we\u2019ll focus on what we can do on the field\u201d. Port are on a seven-game winning streak including a 24-point victory over Richmond last week. Yet they haven\u2019t beaten Hawks in the AFLW and have never won at Ikon Park. \u201cThey\u2019re on a roll, and they\u2019ll bring it,\u201d said West. \u201cWe\u2019re just focusing on our strengths and how to get back to being on the winners list.\u201d The 27-year-old was one of six Hawks named to the All Australian squad this week, the largest cohort from any single club. The players were informed via a prank, after staff told them they were getting fined. \u201cI was a bit worried initially, but once we got told it was the All-Australian squad, I was absolutely stoked,\u201d West said. \u201cEveryone was shocked, but the group really celebrated us and celebrated us hard.\u201d Three Port Adelaide players also received selection: defender Amelie Borg, midfielder Shineah Goody and ruck Matilda Scholz. All are 19. Power coach Lauren Arnell has described Borg as the club\u2019s on-field leader given the ACL injury to captain Janelle Cuthbertson. \u201c[Borg] has been here since day one as a 17-year-old finishing school, you look at the development of her on and off field, she\u2019s been exceptional,\u201d Arnell said last week. \u201cHer work off field as well to help lead this group, and just be a genuinely good teammate, and work her backside off every week really sets the tone for the group and without Janelle out there, she\u2019s the leader.\u201d Scholz is also nominated for Mark of the Year and the Rising Star award. West said she was aware of Port Adelaide\u2019s quality, but said \u201cthey\u2019ll have to match it with us\u201d. \u201cCredit to them, they\u2019re on a roll and doing really well,\u201d West said. \u201cBut us too, I think we\u2019ve had an outstanding season and looking at a team like that it\u2019s just any regular game, and so we will bring our strengths.\u201d The other semi-final is between Adelaide and Fremantle at Norwood Oval where the temperature on Saturday afternoon is forecast to reach the mid-30s. The All-Australian team will be announced on 25 November during grand final week.",

      "body": "<p>US government employees have been injured by UFOs and the US government has conducted a secret UFO retrieval program, a former department of defense official <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?539937-1/hearing-unidentified-anomalous-phenomena\">told a congressional committee</a> on Wednesday, though the hearing lacked any direct evidence to back up the startling claims.</p> <p>The hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), which has become the more accepted term for UFO, also heard that the government had a \u201chuge amount\u201d of secret information on UAPs, including \u201cphotos, video, photos, other information\u201d. But it also learned, following a query from the Colorado congresswoman Lauren Boebert, that there was no evidence of aliens having a secret underwater \u201cbase\u201d on this planet.</p> <p>The hearing came more than a year after the Pentagon was accused of running a secret <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/26/ufo-hearing-congress-evidence-david-grusch\">UFO retrieval program</a> by the whistleblower David Grusch, though no physical evidence has also ever emerged to back up these claims.</p> <p>The lack of concrete proof has been a consistent thorn in the side of those who believe the government is harboring UAPs, with Wednesday\u2019s hearing again focussing on testimony from people who said they were aware of secret government programs, rather than witnesses presenting actual hard evidence.</p> <p>A statement from a Pentagon spokesperson said the department \u201chas not found any verifiable evidence that any UAP observation represented extraterrestrial activity nor has the department discovered any verifiable information to substantiate claims that any programs regarding the possession or reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial materials have existed in the past or exist currently\u201d.</p> <p>It followed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/26/ufo-hearing-congress-evidence-david-grusch\">blockbuster congressional hearing</a> last year in which Grusch, a former American intelligence official, claimed that the US government conducted a \u201cmulti-decade\u201d program which collected and attempted to reverse-engineer crashed UAPs, as members of Congress investigate allegations the government is hiding knowledge of alien craft and beings from lawmakers.</p> <p>The two hearings reveal the remarkable extent to which discussions around UAPs \u2013 previously mostly the domain of conspiracy theorists and believers in aliens \u2013 have now penetrated the US military and the corridors of Congress.</p> <p>The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), the Department of Defense agency that investigates UAPs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the Pentagon has previously denied the existence of any secret government programs to retrieve alien spacecraft and no evidence of these programs has ever emerged.</p> <p>A standout moment on Wednesday came when Nancy Mace, the chair of the hearing, questioned Luis Elizondo, a former department of defense official who this year claimed in a memoir that the US was \u201cin possession of advanced technology made off-world by non-human intelligence\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHas the government conducted secret UAP crash retrieval programs? Yes or no?\u201d Mace asked. Elizondo, who was speaking under oath, said yes.</p> <p>\u201cWere they designed to identify and reverse engineer alien craft? Yes or no?\u201d Mace said. Elizondo said yes.</p> <p>Mace continued: \u201cIn your book, you mentioned government employees who\u2019ve been injured by UAPs placed on leave and receiving government compensation for their injuries. Is that correct?\u201d Elizondo said it was correct.</p> <p>Nick Pope, who spent the early 1990s investigating UFOs for the British Ministry of Defence, said \u201cexpectation management\u201d is important for those following the slow drip of claims about UAPs, but Pope said nevertheless the hearing had \u201cmoved things forward\u201d \u2013 not least in creating more interest and more demand for transparency.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s building up that critical mass. Some people will be coming to this fresh,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a whole bunch of people who probably haven\u2019t heard of David Grusch because they missed that particular story, who will see this and say: \u2018Wait a minute. They\u2019re telling us that this is a crazy subject, no one takes it seriously. And [yet] there\u2019s hearings in Congress?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Wednesday\u2019s hearing heard from Michael Shellenberger, a journalist and founder of the news site <a href=\"https://www.public.news/\">Public</a>, who has reported that the Pentagon has a secret UFO retrieval program called \u201cImmaculate Constellation\u201d.

      "bodyText": "US government employees have been injured by UFOs and the US government has conducted a secret UFO retrieval program, a former department of defense official told a congressional committee on Wednesday, though the hearing lacked any direct evidence to back up the startling claims. The hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), which has become the more accepted term for UFO, also heard that the government had a \u201chuge amount\u201d of secret information on UAPs, including \u201cphotos, video, photos, other information\u201d. But it also learned, following a query from the Colorado congresswoman Lauren Boebert, that there was no evidence of aliens having a secret underwater \u201cbase\u201d on this planet. The hearing came more than a year after the Pentagon was accused of running a secret UFO retrieval program by the whistleblower David Grusch, though no physical evidence has also ever emerged to back up these claims. The lack of concrete proof has been a consistent thorn in the side of those who believe the government is harboring UAPs, with Wednesday\u2019s hearing again focussing on testimony from people who said they were aware of secret government programs, rather than witnesses presenting actual hard evidence. A statement from a Pentagon spokesperson said the department \u201chas not found any verifiable evidence that any UAP observation represented extraterrestrial activity nor has the department discovered any verifiable information to substantiate claims that any programs regarding the possession or reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial materials have existed in the past or exist currently\u201d. It followed a blockbuster congressional hearing last year in which Grusch, a former American intelligence official, claimed that the US government conducted a \u201cmulti-decade\u201d program which collected and attempted to reverse-engineer crashed UAPs, as members of Congress investigate allegations the government is hiding knowledge of alien craft and beings from lawmakers. The two hearings reveal the remarkable extent to which discussions around UAPs \u2013 previously mostly the domain of conspiracy theorists and believers in aliens \u2013 have now penetrated the US military and the corridors of Congress. The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), the Department of Defense agency that investigates UAPs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the Pentagon has previously denied the existence of any secret government programs to retrieve alien spacecraft and no evidence of these programs has ever emerged. A standout moment on Wednesday came when Nancy Mace, the chair of the hearing, questioned Luis Elizondo, a former department of defense official who this year claimed in a memoir that the US was \u201cin possession of advanced technology made off-world by non-human intelligence\u201d. \u201cHas the government conducted secret UAP crash retrieval programs? Yes or no?\u201d Mace asked. Elizondo, who was speaking under oath, said yes. \u201cWere they designed to identify and reverse engineer alien craft? Yes or no?\u201d Mace said. Elizondo said yes. Mace continued: \u201cIn your book, you mentioned government employees who\u2019ve been injured by UAPs placed on leave and receiving government compensation for their injuries. Is that correct?\u201d Elizondo said it was correct. Nick Pope, who spent the early 1990s investigating UFOs for the British Ministry of Defence, said \u201cexpectation management\u201d is important for those following the slow drip of claims about UAPs, but Pope said nevertheless the hearing had \u201cmoved things forward\u201d \u2013 not least in creating more interest and more demand for transparency. \u201cIt\u2019s building up that critical mass. Some people will be coming to this fresh,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole bunch of people who probably haven\u2019t heard of David Grusch because they missed that particular story, who will see this and say: \u2018Wait a minute. They\u2019re telling us that this is a crazy subject, no one takes it seriously. And [yet] there\u2019s hearings in Congress?\u2019\u201d Wednesday\u2019s hearing heard from Michael Shellenberger, a journalist and founder of the news site Public, who has reported that the Pentagon has a secret UFO retrieval program called \u201cImmaculate Constellation\u201d. Shellenberger claimed that \u201ccurrent or former government officials\u201d had told him that the program had \u201cmaybe thousands\u201d of pieces of evidence showing UAPs. \u201cWhat the American people need to know is that the US, military and intelligence community are sitting on a huge amount of visual and other information: still photos, video, photos, other sensor information, and they have for a very long time,\u201d Shellenberger said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not those fuzzy photos and videos that we\u2019ve been given. There\u2019s very clear, high resolution [files].\u201d Shellenberger told the committee he would not name the current or former government officials who had told him about the hidden evidence, but did share a 12-page report on Immaculate Constellation that he said was written by a whistleblower. UAPs have not always been a topic for serious congressional debate, with most politicians seemingly not wanting to become known as a believer in aliens. But members of Congress have sought to destigmatize the issue over the past couple of years by also framing the debate as not just an investigation into whether aliens exist, but also an investigation into secret, and potentially wasteful, government spending. \u201cIf we\u2019re spending money on something that doesn\u2019t exist, why are we spending the money, and if it does exist, why are we hiding it from the public?\u201d Mace said on Wednesday. Nevertheless, alien investigation remains a topic fraught with obvious public relations pitfalls for politicians, and most of the committee members on Wednesday tried to avoid conspiracy theory-sounding language. Most, but not all. \u201cI think it\u2019s about 5% of our ocean that\u2019s actually been studied by man,\u201d Lauren Boebert, a some-time adherent of the QAnon conspiracy theory, noted to Shellenberger at one point. She continued: \u201cAre there any accounts of UAPs emerging from or submerging into our water which could indicate a base or presence beneath the ocean\u2019s surface?\u201d Shellenberger said he had not heard of an underwater alien base, but did say a source had described an \u201corb coming out of the ocean and being met by another orb\u201d. It remains to be seen how much Wednesday\u2019s hearing achieved \u2013 \u201cI hope this will open the door to more hearings in the future,\u201d Mace said \u2013 but there is some hope for those seeking UAP disclosure: in the unlikely form of Donald Trump, who told a podcast earlier this year he would \u201clove\u201d to release more footage of UAPs. \u201cThe elephant in the room here is that we have a new administration in a matter of weeks, and we have a president-elect who has dropped some heavy hints about this, who is a maverick, a populist, a second-termer whose not going to be careful not to upset the bureaucracy or the deep state,\u201d Pope said. \u201cIf [a secret government UAP program] is just very well hidden and under some sort of unique protection, the president, as commander in chief, can say: \u2018I am ordering the de classification of this information, the release of these documents or materials.\u2019\u201d",

      "bodyText": "This blog is closing now, but you can read all our coverage of US politics here . Here\u2019s a roundup of the key developments: Donald Trump said he would nominate far-right Florida congressman Matt Gaetz to be the US attorney general on Wednesday. Gaetz\u2019s nomination is one of the most significant to date. As attorney general, he would be the country\u2019s chief law enforcement officer and oversee the legal positions that the government takes on key issues, including abortion, civil rights laws, and first amendment issues. The pick proved extremely controversial even among Republicans, with many critics pointing to a House ethics committee that is investigating him for allegations of sex trafficking and corruption among other things, which he denies. Gaetz resigned from Congress after news of his nomination broke, meaning that the investigation will come to an end. Trump named the former Democratic congresswoman and Trump campaign surrogate Tulsi Gabbard as his nominee for director of national intelligence. That choice also raised eyebrows given Gabbard\u2019s choice to meet Syrian president Bashar al-Assad her skepticism about well-documented atrocities during the country\u2019s civil war. The president-elect officially named Florida senator Marco Rubio as his nominee for secretary of state. The son of Cuban immigrants is a hawk on China and Iran and a firm supporter of Israel. Joe Biden met Trump at the White House, extending a courtesy to the president-elect and avowed political adversary that the Republican did not reciprocate in 2020, when he refused to acknowledge Biden\u2019s election victory. Melania Trump declined an invitation to meet with Jill Biden. Before heading to the White House, the president-elect stopped by a meeting of House Republicans, who appear on course to preserve their majority, where he joked about seeking a third term. The constitution prohibits that, since he already served one term in the White House. House Democratic minority leader Hakeem Jeffries acknowledged that \u201cwe will not regain control of the Congress in January\u201d. In a statement, he said Democrats would \u201ccontinue to seek bipartisan common ground on any issue \u2026 while pushing back on far right extremism whenever necessary.\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson won the House Republican nomination to stay on the job, on track to keep the gavel after a morning endorsement from President-elect Donald Trump ahead of a full House vote in the new year. Republican senators chose South Dakota\u2019s John Thune as their new leader, replacing long-serving Mitch McConnell, who opted not to stand again for the job. Jack Smith will reportedly wind down his two prosecutions of Trump, one concerning the 2020 election and the other the classified documents found at his properties, and resign before the inauguration. The president-elect has vowed to fire Smith upon taking office, and justice department policy also prohibits the prosecution of sitting presidents. The unofficial results in the race for the US Senate seat in Pennsylvania triggered a legally required statewide recount, commonwealth secretary Al Schmidt said. Democratic Senator Bob Casey and Republican Dave McCormick have vote totals within the one-half of 1% margin that triggers a mandatory recount under state law, Schmidt said in a statement. US government employees have been injured by UFOs and the US government has conducted a secret UFO retrieval program, a former department of defense official told a congressional committee on Wednesday. The hearing lacked any direct evidence to back up the startling claims. Indivisible, a leftwing political umbrella movement founded in response to Donald Trump\u2019s election as president in 2016, has responded to Trump\u2019s choice of Matt Gaetz as attorney general with a strongly worded press release titled \u201cFor Fuck\u2019s Sake\u201d. Among other things, it says: Putting Matt Gaetz in charge of the Department of Justice is like handing a matchbook to an arsonist and asking him to protect the forest. This is a man who\u2019s been investigated for sex trafficking a minor, attended drug-fueled parties with underage girls and is still under House Ethics investigation for sexual misconduct. This isn\u2019t just a reckless choice; it\u2019s a calculated move to dismantle the DOJ and turn it into Trump\u2019s personal revenge squad. The vice-president elect, JD Vance, has dismissed widespread concerns about Trump\u2019s selection of Matt Gaetz as attorney general, saying in a post on X: The main issue with Matt Gaetz is that he used his office to prosecute his political opponents and authorized federal agents to harass parents who were peacefully protesting at school board meetings. Oh wait, that\u2019s actually Merrick Garland, the current attorney general. Until he resigned moments ago, Gaetz was under investigation by a House ethics committee over allegations of \u201cengaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct.\u201d He has denied all wrongdoing. Garland was criticised by Republicans over a memo he issued in 2021, in which he raised concerns about a \u201cdisturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence\u201d at schools, sparking false claims by Republicans that Garland had accused parents of \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d. Republican representative Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, has confirmed reports that he was detained by police at an airport near Washington, DC earlier this month, the Associated Press reports. The news wire writes: McCaul said he became \u201cdisoriented\u201d at Dulles International Airport after he took medication and drank alcohol before his scheduled flight back home to Texas. \u201cTwo weekends ago, I made a mistake \u2013 one for which I take full responsibility. I missed a flight to Texas and found myself disoriented in the airport. This was the result of a poor decision I made to mix an Ambien \u2013 which I took in order to sleep on the upcoming flight \u2013 with some alcohol,\u201d McCaul said in a statement. \u201cLaw enforcement officers briefly detained me while I waited for a family member to pick me up. I have nothing but respect and gratitude for the officers who intercepted me that evening. This incident does not reflect who I am and who I strive to be. As a human, I am not perfect. But I am determined to learn from this mistake and, God-willing, make myself a better person.\u201d McCaul was reelected this month to an 11th term in his district that runs from Austin to the Houston suburbs. US government employees have been injured by UFOs and the US government has conducted a secret UFO retrieval program, a former department of defense official told a congressional committee on Wednesday, though the hearing lacked any direct evidence to back up the startling claims. The hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), which has become the more accepted term for UFO, also heard that the government has a \u201chuge amount\u201d of secret information on UAPs, including \u201cphotos, video, photos, other information\u201d. But it also learned, following a query from Colorado congresswoman Lauren Boebert, that there is no evidence of aliens having a secret underwater \u201cbase\u201d on this planet. The hearing came more than a year after the Pentagon was accused of running a secret UFO retrieval program by whistleblower David Grusch, though no physical evidence has also ever emerged to back up these claims. The lack of concrete proof has been a consistent thorn in the side of those who believe the government is harboring UAPs, with Wednesday\u2019s hearing again focussing on testimony from people who said they were aware of secret government programs, rather than witnesses presenting actual hard evidence. Read on below: Matt Gaetz has resigned from Congress after Donald Trump nominated him for the post of attorney general, the Associated Press is reporting, ending a bipartisan House ethics probe into him that was launched in June over longstanding allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and other alleged ethical breaches. A few more reactions to Trump\u2019s selection of Matt Gaetz to be attorney general have also been coming in, with one Republican representative, Mike Simpson, reportedly responding \u201cAre you sh---ing me?\u201d when asked whether he had the right character for the role. Another Republican representative, Max Miller, called the selection \u201csilly,\u201d according to NBC, adding: I believe that the president is probably rewarding him for being such a loyal soldier to the president. But the president is smart enough, and his team is smart enough to know that Mr Gaetz will never get confirmed by the Senate whatsoever. Hakeem Jeffries, House Democratic minority leader, has acknowledged that \u201cwe will not regain control of the Congress in January\u201d. In a statement, he said House Democrats had \u201coverperformed the national political environment\u201d and praised them for running \u201caggressive, forward-looking and people-centered campaigns.\u201d He also said Democrats would \u201ccontinue to seek bipartisan common ground on any issue \u2026 while pushing back on far right extremism whenever necessary.\u201d Associated Press has yet to make an official call on the House, where the Republicans are one seat short of a majority with 11 races yet to be officially called. The Pentagon has been stunned by Donald Trump\u2019s pick for defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, a national guard veteran and Fox News presenter who has called for a purge of generals for pursuing \u201cwoke\u201d diversity policies. Hegseth has questioned whether the chair of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Charles Brown, was given the top job because he is black and accused him of \u201cpursuing the radical positions of leftwing politicians\u201d. Hegseth was a major in the Minnesota national guard who served as a prison guard at Guant\u00e1namo Bay detention camp and served in Iraq and Afghanistan before becoming an outspoken rightwing critic of the military. He has argued for faster provision of more US weapons to Ukraine for its defence against Russia, but also called US Nato membership into question. His nomination is also a boost for the far right in Israel, as he has shown support for territorial expansion and suggested that Jews could build a new temple on the sacred compound around al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, known to Jews as the Temple Mount. Hegseth told an audience in Jerusalem in 2018: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why the miracle of the re-establishment of the temple on the Temple Mount is not possible.\u201d Read on below: The head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr Mandy Cohen has voiced concerns about the potential role of Robert F Kennedy Jr in a Trump administration, saying he could use it to spread misinformation. Trump has said he wants Kennedy, a vaccine-sceptic and opponent of the fluoridization of drinking water, to \u201ctake care of health\u201d in his second administration. In an interview with the New York Times, Cohen said that even if Kennedy was not appointed to a high-level position, he appears likely to have some role at the White House and in that case would \u201chave a lot of influence in things\u201d. She added: Even without changing one regulation or one piece of guidance, the sharing of misinformation from a place of power is concerning. She also said she hoped \u201cwe can all have a conversation with scientists who work on fluoride\u201d to \u201cmake sure we\u2019re all looking at the same set of data and evidence.\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson has won the House Republican nomination to stay on the job, on track to keep the gavel after a morning endorsement from President-elect Donald Trump ahead of a full House vote in the new year the Associated Press reports. While Johnson has no serious challenger, he faces dissent within his ranks, particularly from hard-right conservatives and the Freedom Caucus withholding their votes as leverage to extract promises ahead. Trump told House Republicans, during the president-elect\u2019s first trip back to Washington since the party swept the 2024 election, that he\u2019s with the speaker all the way, according to a person familiar with the remarks but unauthorized to discuss the private meeting near the Capitol. Johnson heaped praise on Trump, calling him the \u201ccomeback king\u201d. Senator Tammy Duckworth, one of the first women to fly combat missions in Iraq, has condemned Trump\u2019s choice of Fox News presenter Pete Hegseth for next secretary of defence, calling him \u201cdangerously unqualified\u201d and called on her Republican colleagues to oppose the nomination. In a statement, she said: This pick is dangerous, plain and simple. Being Secretary of Defense is a very serious job, and putting someone as dangerously unqualified as Pete Hegseth into that role is something that should scare all of us. By choosing to put a TV personality with little experience running much of anything in charge of the Defense Department\u2019s almost 3 million troops and civilian employees, Donald Trump is once again proving he cares more about his MAGA base than keeping our nation safe\u2014and our troops, our military families and our national security will pay the price. Our troops and our country deserve better. In this moment, my Republican colleagues must recognize the danger that confirming a wholly unqualified Secretary of Defense nominee would put our country in, stop rolling over for Donald Trump and oppose this nomination. The unofficial results in the race for the US Senate seat in Pennsylvania have triggered a legally required statewide recount, commonwealth secretary Al Schmidt has said. Democratic Senator Bob Casey and Republican Dave McCormick have vote totals within the one-half of 1% margin that triggers a mandatory recount under state law, Schmidt said in a statement. As of Wednesday, McCormick led by about 28,000 votes out of more than 6.9 million ballots counted. Counties must begin the recount no later than November 20 and must finish by noon on November 26. It largely involves running paper ballots through high-speed scanners, a process that former election officials say might not change the outcome by more than a few hundred votes. \u201cIt is an infinitesimal number, compared to the overall vote totals,\u201d said Jeff Greenberg, a former Mercer County elections director. Lisa Murkowski, a moderate Republican of Alaska, was open about her views on Matt Gaetz\u2019s nomination. \u201cWe need a serious attorney general. I\u2019m looking forward to the opportunity to consider somebody that is serious,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cThis one was not on my bingo card.\u201d The New York Times also quoted her as adding: \u201cI think it is really important that we don\u2019t roll over on that role of advise and consent and we move through the nomination process. \u201cIf we get good candidates, we will be able to move through the nominations process, hopefully, really readily and that\u2019ll be good for the president, good for him to get his team. But when you put forward picks that are really going to generate controversy, and not just controversy on one side of the aisle, it is going to take longer.\u201d Donald Trump has been busy planning for his presidency, continuing to nominate a cadre of loyalists with few relevant qualifications to key posts. He named the former Democratic congresswoman and Trump campaign surrogate Tulsi Gabbard as his nominee for director of national intelligence, raising eyebrows given Gabbard\u2019s choice to meet Syrian president Bashar al-Assad her skepticism about well-documented atrocities during the country\u2019s civil war. He also named Matt Gaetz, who has protested election results along side far-right Proud Boys and is facing an ethics investigation over allegations he engaged in sex trafficking and had sex with a 17-year-old girl. Trump has officially named Florida senator Marco Rubio as his nominee for secretary of state. News of the choice filtered out over the past day or so, but Trump had not made it official, until today. Joe Biden met Trump at the White House, extending a courtesy to the president-elect and avowed political adversary that the Republican did not reciprocate in 2020, when refused to acknowledge Biden\u2019s election victory. Before heading to the White House, the president-elect stopped by a meeting of House Republicans, who appear on course to preserve their majority, where he joked about seeking a third term. The constitution prohibits that, since he already served one term in the White House. Republican senators chose South Dakota\u2019s John Thune as their new leader, replacing long-serving Mitch McConnell, who opted not to stand again for the job. Jack Smith will reportedly wind down his two prosecutions of Trump, one concerning the 2020 election and the other the classified documents found at his properties, and resign before the inauguration. The president-elect has vowed to fire Smith upon taking office, and justice department policy also prohibits the prosecution of sitting presidents. Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Matt Gaetz for attorney general has sparked outrage and shock. \u201cThis guy has been on the run from the law for quite some time now, so he\u2019ll think he\u2019s above it. He\u2019ll be corrupt as hell,\u201d said Olivia Troye, a former official in the Department of Homeland Security during the Trump administration who has become an outspoken critic of the former president. Robert Weissman, the co-president of the watchdog group Public Citizen said it was \u201chard to imagine a worse and more unqualified candidate\u201d than Gaetz. \u201cAs a member of Congress, Gaetz has demonstrated contempt for the rule of law, truth and decency. He is singularly unqualified to lead an agency that enforces civil rights laws and environmental protection statutes. Under Gaetz, we\u2019d have every reason to expect an America where corporate criminals walk free but immigrants and people of color are harassed or rounded up with minimal pretext,\u201d he said in a statement. Meanwhile, Republicans in the Senate have been evading questions from reporters about whether they found Gaetz to be qualified and whether they would approve his nomination. Thom Tillis, a Republican senator of North Carolina, told Politico\u2019s Burgess Everett: \u201cI\u2019m all about counting votes, and I would think that he\u2019s probably got some work cut out for him.\u201d Thomas Massie, a Republican congressman of Kentucky, had an interesting response to reporters asking him what he made of the Matt Gaetz nomination: \u201cRecess appointments.\u201d Despite coming into office with a Republican Senate full of supporters, Donald Trump has been pushing for \u201crecess appointments\u201d to give himself even more authority to pick whomever he wants to fill cabinet positions. Normally, the Senate approves presidential nominations for high-level posts, but the the constitution allows the president to install officials without Senate approval while Congress is not in session. In recent years, the Senate has avoided going on extended recesses to block the president from making such appointments. Neither Trump nor Joe Biden used recesses to make appointments during their terms, in part because the practice of using the loophole to make appointments was curtailed following a supreme court ruling that Obama overstepped his power in making recess nominations. Trump wants the practice reinstated. Amid the race to replace Mitch McConnell as Senate leader, however, Trump posted on X: \u201cAny Republican senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!)\u201d If Trump is able to bring back recess appointments, then Gaetz becomes attorney general, Massie told reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s the attorney general. Suck it up.\u201d Donald Trump will be taking office with a Republican Senate, one filled with allies who appear ready to enable him fully. Though it remains unclear if Matt Gaetz will receive a Senate confirmation, it\u2019s clear that some of Gaetz\u2019s one-time critics are ready to back Trump\u2019s nominees. Oklahoma senator Markwayne Mullin has previously accused Gaetz of sharing videos of girls he slept with on the House floor. He told CNN last year that Gaetz would \u201cbrag about how he would crush ED medicine and chase it with an energy drink so he could go all night\u201d. On CNN just now, he said: \u201cI completely trust President Trump\u2019s decision making on this one.\u201d Mullin admitted that Gaetz is likely to face tough questions at his hearing. \u201cHopefully he\u2019s able to answer the questions right, and if he can then we\u2019ll go through the confirmation process.\u201d Mullin himself has been floated as an option for Interior secretary or secretary of Veterans Affairs. Susan Collins, the moderate Republican senator of Maine told reporters she was \u201cshocked\u201d but the Matt Gaetz nomination. \u201cI was shocked by the announcement \u2013 that shows why the advise-and-consent process is so important,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI\u2019m sure that there will be a lot of questions raised at his hearing.\u201d Matt Gaetz has been one of the most loyal backers of Donald Trump in Congress, supporting Trump\u2019s attempts to deny the results of the 2020 election. He voted with about 150 Republicans to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Along with members of the far-right group the Proud Boys, he took part in protests against the result of a Senate race in Florida. He also evoked language adopted by the Proud Boys at Trump\u2019s hush money trial earlier this year, posting on social media: \u201cStanding back, and standing by, Mr President\u201d, along with a photo of him with Trump and other congressional Republicans. Capitol Hill reporters are gathering shocked and evasive responses from Republicans reacting to the Gaetz nomination. Senator Chuck Grassley stopped talking to reporters when asked for his reaction. House appropriations chair Tom Cole avoided responding as well: \u201cI know nothing about it.\u201d Senator Ron Johnson: \u201cThe president gets to pick his nominees.\u201d Matt Gaetz, the Florida congressman who Donald Trump just nominated to be his attorney general, has for years faced allegations of sexual misconduct. Last year, Gaetz said the justice department had closed an investigation that began after allegations emerged of the congressman having sex with a 17-year-old girl and paying for her travel. The House ethics committee earlier this year announced that it was beginning its own inquiry into whether Gaetz \u201cengaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favours to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct\u201d. That investigation has not yet been publicly concluded. Here\u2019s more about it: Since he first arrived in Congress in 2017, just days before Donald Trump took office, Matt Gaetz has been one of his most vocal advocates on Capitol Hill. Now, Gaetz may lead the justice department, and ensure that prosecutorial decisions, which are normally made independently by the attorney general, are to Trump\u2019s benefit. From a profile of Gaetz the Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino published last year, shortly after he led the successful effort to oust fellow Republican Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House: \u201cFlorida Man. Built for Battle,\u201d reads Gaetz\u2019s bio on X, formerly Twitter. Gaetz followed his father into politics more than two decades ago. After serving in the Florida statehouse, Gaetz was elected in 2016 to represent a ruby-red chunk of the Florida panhandle. Since his arrival in Washington, the pompadoured lawmaker has built a political brand as a far-right provocateur, courting controversy seemingly as a matter of course. Like Donald Trump, to whom he is fiercely loyal, Gaetz is more interested in sparring with political foes than in the dry business of governance, according to his critics. On Capitol Hill, he has repeatedly disrupted House proceedings, including once barging into a secure facility where Democrats were holding a deposition hearing. In 2018, he was condemned for inviting a Holocaust denier to Trump\u2019s State of the Union address. A year later, he hired a speechwriter who had been fired by the Trump White House after speaking at a conference that attracts white nationalists. Months after the January 6 attack on the Capitol, Gaetz embarked on an \u201cAmerica First\u201d tour with Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right Georgia congresswoman, in which they amplified the former president\u2019s false claims of fraud in the 2020 election. He also continued to attack Republicans critical of Trump, using language that reportedly alarmed McCarthy, who feared the lawmakers\u2019 words could incite violence. Donald Trump has chosen Matt Gaetz, of his most prominent defenders in Congress, to serve as attorney general. The appointment could put Gaetz in charge of Trump\u2019s promised effort to retaliate against his political opponents, including officials who served in his previous administration but have since repudiated him. Trump announced the nomination, which must be confirmed by the Senate, on Truth Social: It is my Great Honor to announce that Congressman Matt Gaetz, of Florida, is hereby nominated to be The Attorney General of the United States. Matt is a deeply gifted and tenacious attorney, trained at the William &amp; Mary College of Law, who has distinguished himself in Congress through his focus on achieving desperately needed reform at the Department of Justice. Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System. Matt will end Weaponized Government, protect our Borders, dismantle Criminal Organizations and restore Americans\u2019 badly-shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department. On the House Judiciary Committee, which performs oversight of DOJ, Matt played a key role in defeating the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, and exposing alarming and systemic Government Corruption and Weaponization. He is a Champion for the Constitution and the Rule of Law\u2026 Gaetz, a congressman representing a very conservative district in the Florida panhandle, became known nationally last year when he was a key player in the putsch that ousted Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House. The Senate confirms nominees for director of national intelligence, a cabinet-level position created after 9/11 to oversee the intelligence community and liaise directly with the president. There is reason to think that Tulsi Gabbard might raise a few eyebrows in the Senate, even when it is controlled by Trump-aligned Republicans, as it will be from January. As a congresswoman from Hawaii, Gabbard visited Syria, met with its president Bashar al-Assad, and expressed skepticism about well-documented atrocities attributed to his forces during the country\u2019s civil war. More recently, she has spent time attacking Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. It\u2019s all a turnabout from her days in Democratic politics, when she vyed unsuccessfully for the party\u2019s presidential nomination in 2020 and backed Bernie Sanders\u2019 candidacy four years prior. Here\u2019s more about how her views have shifted dramatically: Donald Trump has named former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard as his nominee for director of national intelligence. Gabbard is another loyalist who frequently joined Trump at campaign events. Here\u2019s what he had to say in announcing in picking Gabbard, who represented Hawaii from 2013 to 2021, and endorsed Trump after leaving the Democratic party: I am pleased to announce that former Congresswoman, Lieutenant Colonel Tulsi Gabbard, will serve as Director of National Intelligence (DNI). For over two decades, Tulsi has fought for our Country and the Freedoms of all Americans. As a former Candidate for the Democrat Presidential Nomination, she has broad support in both Parties - She is now a proud Republican! I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our Constitutional Rights, and securing Peace through Strength. Tulsi will make us all proud! Donald Trump has just officially named Florida senator Marco Rubio as his nominee for secretary of state. News of the choice filtered out over the past day or so, but Trump had not made it official, until now. Here\u2019s what he said: It is my Great Honor to announce that Senator Marco Rubio, of Florida, is hereby nominated to be The United States Secretary of State. Marco is a Highly Respected Leader, and a very powerful Voice for Freedom. He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries. I look forward to working with Marco to Make America, and the World, Safe and Great Again! Joe Biden\u2019s meeting with Donald Trump was attended by Susie Wiles, who the president-elect recently announced would serve as his White House chief of staff. Wiles, who co-managed Trump\u2019s campaign, will be the first woman to hold role. Biden\u2019s chief of staff, Jeff Zients, also attended. While Donald Trump appears to have mostly stayed out of the race for Senate Republican leader, the Maga hardcore were rooting for Florida senator Rick Scott. He unsuccessfully challenged Mitch McConnell for the leadership post two years ago, and his bid this year was similarly unsuccessful. In a statement released after John Thune won the race, Scott said: I may have lost the vote, but I am optimistic. I ran for leader with one mission: to fundamentally change how the Senate operates and upend the status quo so we can actually start representing the voters who put us here. When I announced, I said that we are in a moment where we need dramatic change. The voters confirmed that last week when they elected President Trump and Republicans took the majority in both chambers of Congress with a clear mandate. \u2026 While it isn\u2019t the result we hoped for, I will do everything possible to make sure John Thune is successful in accomplishing President Trump\u2019s agenda. When asked about comments made by Trump\u2019s new pick for secretary of defense, Fox and Friends co-host Pete Hegseth, that \u201cwe should not have women in combat roles\u201d, Jean-Pierre spoke to the \u201cimportance of gender equality, of women in the workforce\u201d. She said the Biden administration does not agree with those views. Biden \u201clooked forward to the conversation and appreciated the conversation,\u201d Jean-Pierre said, adding that the two met for nearly two hours. \u201cI think the length of the meeting tells you they had an in-depth conversation on an array of issues.\u201d A reporter asked Jean-Pierre if there were any conversations between Biden and Trump about not accepting the results of the 2020 election, but she said it was now about \u201cmoving forward\u201d. \u201cThere was an election last week and the American people spoke.\u201d Jean-Pierre said she won\u2019t go into \u201cgranular detail\u201d about the Biden-Trump meeting. \u201cWhat I can say it was indeed cordial, very gracious and very substantive. National security was discussed. Domestic policy issues were discussed,\u201d she said. She added that Biden stressed the importance of a peaceful transition. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is now addressing the press following the Trump-Biden meeting. \u201cWe have a mandate from the American people \u2013 a mandate not only to clean up the mess left by the Biden-Harris-Schumer agenda but also to deliver on President Trump\u2019s priorities,\u201d Thune said. Thune said the party would give Trump the tools to \u201cenforce border security laws and remove violent criminals who are wreaking havoc in every one of our states\u201d. Cracking down on immigration has been a key plank of Trump\u2019s campaign. Trump\u2019s newly appointed \u201cborder czar\u201d Tom Homan said earlier this year: \u201cI will run the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen. They ain\u2019t seen shit yet. Wait until 2025.\u201d\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a new day in the United States Senate and it\u2019s a new day in America,\u201d John Thune said in a press conference shortly after being chosen as the new Republican Senate conference leader. \u201cThis Republican team is united. We are one team and excited to reclaim the majority.\u201d Thune vowed to clean up the \u201cmess\u201d left by Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Chuck Schumer. Donald Trump opposes efforts to fight climate change, but the Guardian\u2019s Fiona Harvey reports that Barbados\u2019s prime minister Mia Mottley wants to sit down with him to see if there may be proposals he would be willing to support to counter the crisis. Here\u2019s more: Mia Mottley, the climate-championing prime minister of Barbados, has invited Donald Trump to a face-to-face meeting where she would seek \u201ccommon ground\u201d and persuade him that climate action was in his own interests. \u201cLet us find a common purpose in saving the planet and saving livelihoods,\u201d she told the Guardian at the UN\u2019s Cop29 climate summit in Azerbaijan. \u201cWe are human beings and we have the capacity to meet face-to-face, in spite of our differences. We want humanity to survive. And the evidence [of the climate crisis] we are seeing almost weekly now.\u201d Only by personal meetings among world leaders can the massive changes needed on climate action be achieved, she believes. \u201cPresident Trump has been very clear about the importance of that kind of face-to-face conversation in the things that he believes that he can solve as well.\u201d Mottley, the prime minister who took Barbados out of the Commonwealth realm to be a republic, has been an electrifying presence at recent UN climate summits since she took to the stage at Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021 with an impassioned speech demanding world leaders \u201ctry harder\u201d to avoid passing a death sentence on her country. Since then, she has gained a global reputation as a formidable champion of the developing countries most affected by climate breakdown. She has also led a movement among developing and some developed countries to change the global financial system to generate the funds needed to shift the world to a low-carbon economy. Donald Trump has announced several cabinet picks in recent days, often only after word of his selection was leaked or revealed by other parties. Indeed, Trump still has not officially announced Florida senator Marco Rubio as his nominee for secretary of state, though it has been reported widely in the press. NBC News asked Rubio today if the appointment is confirmed, and he replied: Those are media reports, any announcements will come from the Trump transition team. Here is a look at who has been named for the second Trump administration, and who is said to be under consideration: John Thune had this to say following his election as the Senate Republican leader, a position in which he will be tasked with steering the incoming president\u2019s legislative proposals through Congress\u2019s upper chamber: I am extremely honored to have earned the support of my colleagues to lead the Senate in the 119th Congress, and I am beyond proud of the work we have done to secure our majority and the White House. This Republican team is united behind President Trump\u2019s agenda, and our work starts today. Thune will likely face two obstacles in the job over the next two years: Democrats, who can use the filibuster to stop Trump\u2019s bills, and Republicans who are not onboard with Trump\u2019s proposals, or Thune\u2019s strategy. Joe Biden is presently meeting with Donald Trump at the White House, extending a courtesy to the president-elect and avowed political adversary that the Republican did not give him in 2020, when he instead refused to acknowledge Biden\u2019s election victory. Despite all that, the meeting appeared friendly, at least from what reporters witnessed, with Biden promising \u201ca smooth transition\u201d and Trump saying \u201cit is a nice world today\u201d. Before heading to the White House, the president-elect stopped by a meeting of House Republicans, who appear on course to preserve their majority, where he joked about seeking a third term. The constitution prohibits that, since he already served one term in the White House. Here\u2019s what else has happened today so far: Republican senators have chosen South Dakota\u2019s John Thune as their new leader, replacing long-serving Mitch McConnell, who opted not to stand again for the job. Trump is reportedly considering nominating former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence. She\u2019ll have to be confirmed by the Senate, who might want to know more about her visit with Bashar al-Assad. Jack Smith will reportedly wind down his two prosecutions of Trump, one concerning the 2020 election and the other the classified documents found at his properties, and resign before the inauguration. The president-elect has vowed to fire Smith upon taking office, and justice department policy also prohibits the prosecution of sitting presidents. Republican senators have elected John Thune of South Dakota as their new leader, replacing Mitch McConnell, the Associated Press reports. Thune, who serves as the minority whip, the second-highest-ranking position among Republicans, will become the chamber\u2019s majority leader in January, once newly elected GOP lawmakers take their seats and give the party control of the Senate. McConnell has led Senate Republicans since 2007, spearheading the opposition to Barack Obama and assisting Donald Trump during his first term in office. The Kentucky senator played a decisive role in creating the supreme court\u2019s conservative supermajority by blocking Obama from appointing a justice, then presiding over the confirmation of three of Trump\u2019s appointees. McConnell opted not to stand again as Senate leader, but holds his seat through 2026. From what reporters were able to see, there was a degree of comity between Joe Biden and Donald Trump when they met in the Oval Office. But Reuters reports that the formal arrangements of the presidential transition have seen delays: Trump\u2019s team, which has already announced some members of the incoming president\u2019s cabinet, has yet to sign agreements that would lead to office space and government equipment as well as access to government officials, facilities and information, according to the White House. \u201cThe Trump-Vance transition lawyers continue to constructively engage with the Biden-Harris Administration lawyers regarding all agreements contemplated by the Presidential Transition Act,\u201d said Brian Vance, a spokesperson for the Trump transition, referring to the law that governs the transfer of power. Valerie Smith Boyd, director of the Partnership for Public Service\u2019s Center for Presidential Transition, a non-profit that advises incoming administrations, said the agreement underscores that the United States only has one president at a time and includes pledges to sign ethics pacts not to profit off information provided in the transition. \u201cThat needs to be signed for interaction to begin with federal agencies,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is hinging on that.\u201d It does not appear that Melania Trump, the incoming first lady, joined her husband during his visit to Washington today. But the White House said that Jill Biden greeted Donald Trump when he arrived, and gave him a \u201chandwritten letter of congratulations\u201d for his wife, while saying her team was ready to help with their transition. Here is a full transcript of the few words Joe Biden and Donald Trump said to each other while reporters were present in the Oval Office. Biden: We\u2019re looking forward to having, like we said, a smooth transition, do everything we can make sure you\u2019re accommodated, what you need, and we\u2019re going to get a chance to talk about some of that today. Welcome, welcome back. Trump: Thank you very much. And politics is tough, and it\u2019s, many cases, not a very nice world, but it is a nice world today, and I appreciate very much a transition that\u2019s so smooth, it\u2019ll be as smooth as it can get. And I very much appreciate that, Joe. Biden: You\u2019re welcome. Thank you all. At that point, reporters were asked to leave. Some shouted questions at the two leaders, but they did not answer. Reporters were let into the Oval Office for Donald Trump and Joe Biden\u2019s meeting for a short period of time, and heard the two men say little. \u201cPolitics is tough and in many cases it\u2019s not a nice world, but it is a nice world today,\u201d Trump said, in one of the few comments either made. Video of their encounter shows Trump and Biden sitting in chairs by the fireplace and smiling as reporters shout questions. Neither man answers, though Trump appears to mouth \u201cthank you\u201d at one point. Press photographers were allowed into the room at the beginning of Donald Trump\u2019s meeting with Joe Biden in the Oval Office. Here\u2019s what they saw: Donald Trump and Joe Biden are meeting in the Oval Office, according to reporters at the White House. The press was only let into the room for about a minute, but could hear Trump say something about how politics is tough, and thank Biden for a smooth transition of power. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d the president replied. As House Republicans cheer Donald Trump\u2019s victory, Axios reports that Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House minority leader, has acknowledged to his lawmakers that they are unlikely to become the majority. Ballot counting is ongoing in races that will determine which party controls the chamber, but Jeffries said in a private meeting with his lawmakers that it was increasingly unlikely Democrats would win back control. \u201cThere is a mathematical \u2018possibility\u2019 we could still take the majority, but not a \u2018probability\u2019,\u201d Jeffries said, according to a Democratic member quoted by Axio. The New York lawmaker also said that \u201cthe buck stops with me\u201d when it comes to the failure to take the House. Donald Trump is scheduled to at 11am sit for a meeting with Joe Biden at the White House to discuss the transition between their administrations. No such meeting happened after Biden won election in 2020, because Trump refused to acknowledge his victory, and instead tried to prevent him from taking office. Biden and Trump have spent the past four years denouncing each other, but the president quickly reached out to set up a meeting with the Republican after he won last Tuesday\u2019s election. Reporters are scheduled to be allowed into the Oval Office, where Biden and Trump are meeting, for a few minutes when it begins. We\u2019ll let you know what the two leaders have to say. Here\u2019s what it looked like when Donald Trump stopped by Capitol Hill to greet House Republicans: Donald Trump joked about running for a third term as president, during an address to House Republicans in Washington DC. \u201cI suspect I won\u2019t be running again, unless you say, he\u2019s good, we got to figure something else,\u201d Trump said. The constitution prohibits Trump from running for re-election, since he previously served one term in office that lasted from 2017 till 2021. Donald Trump is considering appointing Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman who left the party and endorsed his candidacy, as his director of national intelligence, Punchbowl News reports. Gabbard represented Hawaii from 2013 through 2021, and made a failed attempt to win the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. As a congresswoman, she made an unusual trip to government-controlled areas of Syria during its civil war, met with its president, Bashar al-Assad, and later publicly doubted his responsibility in a well-documented chemical weapons attack. Should Trump nominate her for the job overseeing US intelligence agencies, you can expect that episode to come up at her confirmation hearings. Here\u2019s more about her, from when she made her bid for president: As the dawn of a new Trump era looms, two blue state governors are launching an initiative to confront the threat of authoritarianism and safeguard American democratic institutions. Governors Safeguarding Democracy is a non-partisan coalition of governors, chaired by Illinois governor JB Pritzker and Colorado governor Jared Polis. \u201cWe founded GSD because we know that simple hope alone will not save our democracy,\u201d said Polis. \u201cWe need to work together, especially at the state level, to protect and strengthen.\u201d Across the country, Democratic governors and attorneys general are preparing for a second Trump administration by readying lawsuits and legislation that could serve as a bulwark against any attempts to undermine state-level climate initiatives, abortion access or federal disaster relief funding. The governors said they would seek input from thinktanks, legal experts and democracy advocates. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is pushing back against increasing threats of autocracy and fortifying the institutions of democracy that our country and our states depend upon.\u201d Pritzker told reporters on Tuesday. The governors said they have been in contact with several governors about joining the initiative, including Republicans, but did not offer the names of any other members. The alliance is modeling itself after the Reproductive Freedom Alliance, a governors\u2019 working group that formed after the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade. According to Pritzker and Polis, the new coalition will provide a more formal structure allowing for cross-state collaboration on policies that reinforce and protect the rule of law and democratic institutions. It is also aimed at allowing for a more coordinated response to \u201cemerging threats\u201d. Polis said the governors were particularly concerned about threats to the integrity of the US election system, but that the group would also be focused on \u201cprotecting the principle of an independent judiciary, our Constitutional principles, the health of democracy and civil society\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s about being proactive around educating people and making sure governors have the toolkit to support our small d democratic institutions, as well as, of course, being reacting effectively and coordinating response to any threats to our democracy that come from any president or from foreign powers,\u201d he added. Reporters on Capitol Hill have spotted JD Vance arriving for the Senate Republican Conference\u2019s leadership election. He will become vice-president along with Donald Trump on 20 January, but, until then, represents Ohio in the Senate, a job he got (only!) two years ago. Punchbowl News reports that Vance declined to say which candidate he is supporting to lead the party. Another story to watch today is the behind-closed-doors election Senate Republicans are holding to replace outgoing leader Mitch McConnell. McConnell is one of the most influential conservative politicians in the country. The Kentucky lawmaker led the opposition to Barack Obama\u2019s presidency and blocked him from appointing a supreme court justice in 2014, paving the way for Donald Trump to appoint three justices that decisively tilted the court to the right and overturned Roe v Wade. But after a series of health scares, the 82-year-old announced earlier this year that he would not stand again to lead the party in Congress\u2019s upper chamber. Three candidates stand to replace him: top-ranking senators John Thune of South Dakota and John Cornyn of Texas, and Rick Scott, a Florida senator who has lately received a boost from people aligned with Trump\u2019s Maga agenda. Whoever emerges as the GOP conference\u2019s pick will become Senate majority leader next year, when the party officially takes control of the chamber from Democrats. He\u2019ll also become a leading figure in implementing Trump\u2019s legislative agenda. It\u2019s worth noting that we still do not know for sure if Republicans will continue to hold a majority in the House of Representatives. Ballot counting is ongoing in a small number of close races in western states, but according to the Associated Press, the GOP has won 216 seats to the Democrats\u2019 207, with 218 seats needed for a majority. Donald Trump\u2019s allies have managed to pick up four Democratic-held seats, while the Democrats have flipped only one. Should Democrats pull of surprise victories in enough outstanding seats to gain a majority, it would put them in a position to block Trump\u2019s legislative proposals. Even if the GOP wins the majority again, it will likely be a small one \u2013 which can pose its own problems. Donald Trump will meet with the House GOP before he sits down with Joe Biden to discuss the presidential transition at the White House. Republican House speaker Mike Johnson announced the meeting yesterday, which comes as Republicans appear on track to keep their majority in Congress\u2019s lower chamber. Politico reports that the president-elect will appear at the meeting beginning at 9am. Justice department special counsel Jack Smith plans to end his two prosecutions of Donald Trump and resign before the president-elect takes office, the New York Times reports. Smith last year indicted Trump for allegedly plotting to overturn his 2020 election defeat, and for conspiring to hide classified documents. Neither case made it to trial before Trump\u2019s election victory last week, which appeared to make it impossible for Smith to continue. Justice department policy prohibits the prosecution of sitting presidents, and Trump has vowed to fire Smith within \u201ctwo seconds\u201d of becoming president again. Here\u2019s more, from the Times: Jack Smith, the special counsel who pursued two federal prosecutions of Donald J. Trump, plans to finish his work and resign along with other members of his team before Mr. Trump takes office in January, people familiar with his plans said. Mr. Smith\u2019s goal, they said, is to not leave any significant part of his work for others to complete and to get ahead of the president-elect\u2019s promise to fire him within \u201ctwo seconds\u201d of being sworn in. Mr. Smith, who since taking office two years ago has operated under the principle that not even a powerful ex-president is above the law, now finds himself on the defensive as he rushes to wind down a pair of complex investigations slowed by the courts and ultimately made moot by Mr. Trump\u2019s electoral victory. Mr. Smith\u2019s office is still drawing up its plan for how to end the cases, and it is possible that unforeseen circumstances \u2014 such as judicial rulings or decisions by other government officials \u2014 could alter his intended timeline. But Mr. Smith is trying to finish his work and leave before Mr. Trump returns to power, the people familiar with his plans said. \u2026 As he prepares for his last act as special counsel, Mr. Smith\u2019s ultimate audience will not be a jury, but the public. Department regulations call for him to file a report summarizing his investigation and decisions \u2014 a document that may stand as the final accounting from a prosecutor who filed extensive charges against a former president but never got his cases to trial. It is not clear how quickly he can finish this work, leaving uncertain whether it could be made public before the Biden administration leaves office. But several officials said he has no intention of lingering any longer than he has to, and has told career prosecutors and F.B.I. agents on his team who are not directly involved in that process that they can start planning their departures over the next few weeks, people close to the situation said. Secretary of state Antony Blinken is in Brussels in Belgium, where he has been meeting recently appointed Nato secretary general Mark Rutte. In comments after the meeting, he set out to the media how Joe Biden\u2019s administration intends to continue supporting Ukraine as the transition to the second Donald Trump administration gets under way. He told reporters: We have a very intense and important agenda over the next couple of months. And as I said to the secretary general, president Biden fully intends to drive through the tape and use every day to continue to do what we\u2019ve done over these last four years, which is strengthen this alliance that\u2019s so critical to the security of the US and security of countries throughout Europe. And we will do that and as well to continue to shore up everything we\u2019re doing for Ukraine to make sure that it can effectively defend itself against this Russian aggression. In a few hours Joe Biden and Donald Trump will meet at the White House, a courtesy that Trump did not afford to Biden when he succeeded him as president after the 2020 election. Republican strategist Susan Del Percio, writing for MSNBC, suggests that today will see both men on their best behavior. She writes: For the sake of the country, [Biden] will be gracious, congratulate Trump on winning a fair election and, most of all, emphasize the importance of a peaceful transfer of power. Trump will likely be polite and probably bring up Biden\u2019s call to him following the first attempt on his life in July \u2014 a call he seemed to genuinely appreciate. But don\u2019t be surprised if he drops some sort of wisecrack walking out the door. Do expect Biden to use a little humor \u2014 not only is it in his nature, but it is a disarming technique. It will likely end with Biden assuring Trump, and the public, that he will do everything possible to make this a smooth transition and promise to assist the president-elect in any way needed. From our opinion desk Moira Donegan has her column today, in which she says that the \u201cYour body, my choice\u201d slogan is a creepy, snide and all-too-revealing mantra for pro-Trump young men. You can read it here \u2026 In his Axios newsletter this morning Mike Allen chooses to major on president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s surprise pick of Pete Hegseth for defense secretary, which Allen describes as a \u201cPentagon shocker.\u201d He writes: President Trump made the biggest and most unconventional pick of his transition last evening by tapping Fox News host and decorated Army veteran Pete Hegseth, 44, to be defense secretary. Hegseth favors a non-interventionist America First foreign policy, in contrast with Trump\u2019s more hawkish picks for other top national security roles. The choice channels Trump\u2019s affinity for cable news and high ratings. Hegseth has lobbied heavily on behalf of several service members accused of war crimes and privately encouraged then-president Trump to issue pardons. Mehdi Hasan writes for the Guardian today, asking \u201cIs Donald Trump a foreign policy dove?\u201d You can read it here \u2026 Associated Press has described Fox News host Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump\u2019s pick for defense secretary, as \u201csomeone largely inexperienced and untested on the global stage to take over the world\u2019s largest and most powerful military\u201d. The news agency points out that in an interview the Shawn Ryan Show podcast, Hegseth has previously expressed the view that allowing women to serve in combat increases the number of casualties the US military suffers. It quotes him saying: Everything about men and women serving together makes the situation more complicated, and complication in combat, that means casualties are worse. He said minority and white men can perform similarly but the same isn\u2019t true for women, adding that by opening combat slots to women \u201cwe\u2019ve changed the standards in putting them there, which means you\u2019ve changed the capability of that unit\u201d. Donald Trump appointee Vivek Ramaswamy is somewhat less known outside the US than Elon Musk. Ramaswamy is an American entrepreneur, who ran for the Republican nomination for president against Trump, dropping out of the race early in 2024. His parents moved to the US from Kerala, and he has attended Harvard and Yale. The 39-year-old lives in New York and has a house in Ohio, and is married with two children. Forbes has stated he is one of the 20 youngest billionaires in the US, and his business interests have included biotech firm Roivant Sciences, Chapter Medicare and he also worked at hedge fund QVT. Ramaswamy also notoriously appeared to broadcast himself urinating during a live X talk that featured Elon Musk, Alex Jones, Andrew Tate, Matt Gaetz and others. US politics website the Hill is reporting that the hardline Trumpist Republican Freedom caucus in the House is to drop its objection to the re-election of speaker Mike Johnson, and will not be putting up an alternative candidate. Instead it is believed the group will force an on the record vote on Johnson\u2019s role, which will allow them to register their onjection to his reappointment. The caucus is unhappy with proposed rule changes intended to enforce better party discipline on the more rebellious Republican members of the House. Joe Biden will host Donald Trump later today at the White House as part of transition efforts between the current administration and the incoming one. Yesterday White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters \u201c[Biden] believes in the norms, he believes in our institution, he believes in the peaceful transfer of power. That is what is the norm. That is what is supposed to happen.\u201d Reuters reports that Brian Vance, a spokesperson for the Trump transition, said \u201cThe Trump-Vance transition lawyers continue to constructively engage with the Biden-Harris administration lawyers regarding all agreements contemplated by the Presidential Transition Act.\u201d In an analysis piece for CNN, Stephen Collinson has described Donald Trump\u2019s flurry of announcements as \u201ca night of Maga shock and awe.\u201d He writes: The selection of people such as Elon Musk, Kristi Noem and Pete Hegseth are partly designed to honor the aspirations of Trump\u2019s voters and epitomize the president-elect\u2019s own outsider brand \u2014 as well as his deeply developed craving for loyalty. His choice of ultra-loyalists is borne out of Trump\u2019s frustration that establishment military officers, officials and conventional Washington operators reined in his own most extreme impulses in his first term. But Trump is also taking a risk. While it makes sense to pick outside revolutionaries to tear down governance, many of his picks lack the kind of in-depth experience and knowledge of the departments they will run. In its coverage of the controversial appointment of Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a non-governmental commission to cut government spending, the Washington Post reminds readers of something the latter said earlier in the year. It quotes Ramaswamy saying \u201cWe have a fourth branch of government \u2013 the administrative state \u2013 that our Founding Fathers didn\u2019t envision. Removing the excess bureaucracy is going to be good for our economy and for our national spirit.\u201d The Washington Post goes on to say: A person familiar with the effort, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive negotiations, said that details of the organization\u2019s funding would emerge soon. The [Republicans] had talked about reducing waste for many years, but had not been effective, the person added, leading the campaign to the conclusion \u2018outsiders with a much more entrepreneurial approach\u2019 were better suited to the task. Some Trump advisers see Musk\u2019s commission as an opportunity to implement long-sought goals to reduce federal spending and regulation. They have pointed to the Grace Commission, a Reagan-era panel that recommended billions of dollars in spending cuts. Under that model, which some Trump advisers hope the Musk plan will emulate, the commission identified hundreds or thousands of examples of wasteful government programs and regulations, and called on Congress to approve the recommendations, backed by the president. The constitution gives Congress authority over taxation and spending, meaning any federal budget changes recommended by Musk\u2019s commission would have to be approved by the House and Senate. As my colleague Philip Wen noted in his report on the appointment of Elon Musk and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to the newly created \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d, a lot of details remain unclear: It is not clear how the organization will operate. It could come under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which dictates how external groups that advise the government must operate and be accountable to the public. Federal employees are generally required to disclose their assets and entanglements to ward off any potential conflicts of interest, and to divest significant holdings relating to their work. Because Musk and Ramaswamy would not be formal federal workers, they would not face those requirements or ethical limitations. Trump said the agency will be conducting a \u201ccomplete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government, and making recommendations for drastic reforms\u201d. Trump said their work would conclude by 4 July 2026, adding that a smaller and more efficient government would be a \u201cgift\u201d to the country on the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Read more here: Trump selects Elon Musk to lead government efficiency department The announcement that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy would lead a new non-governmental \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d has immediately raised questions about conflicts of interest. Both men, CNN notes, \u201clead companies with existing, lucrative government contracts\u201d. Musk runs companies including Tesla, SpaceX, X and Neuralink while Ramaswamy is a wealthy biotech entrepreneur. In his statement announcing the new roles, president-elect Donald Trump said of Musk and Ramaswamy: Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my administration to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal agencies. Reacting to his appointment, and giving his view of what he sees as government bureaucracy, Ramaswamy posted to X to say \u201cShut it down\u201d. Ramaswamy also announced he was ending his bid to be appointed Ohio senator in stead of JD Vance, who is set to become vice president. Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s ongoing coverage of US politics. Here are the headlines \u2026 President-elect Donald Trump has continued to make appointments as he prepares to return to the White House. Former governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, who once said he dreamed of building a holiday home in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, will be the US ambassador to Israel South Dakota governor Kristi Noem will lead the Department of Homeland Security. Fox News host Pete Hegseth will serve as secretary of defense, while John Ratcliffe will lead the CIA and William Joseph McGinley will serve as White House counsel Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead a new \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d, which Trump says will not actually be a government agency. They will, according to Trump, work from outside the government to \u201cdrive large scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to government never seen before\u201d. Both men already have lucrative government contracts, leading to questions about an immediate conflict of interest Republican Rep David Valadao sealed California\u2019s 22nd Congressional district, beating Democrat Rudy Salas, and edging the Republicans closer to the 218 mark which will give them control of the House The judge in Trump\u2019s Manhattan criminal hush-money case has postponed deciding on whether to throw out the conviction on presidential immunity grounds Joe Biden\u2019s administration has said it will not halt arms transfers to Israel, despite eight international aid groups saying Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government has failed to meet US demands to increase humanitarian aid to the besieged Gaza Strip",

The report by the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission stated that in the immediate aftermath of the crash, AB was not questioned about his alcohol consumption. That was despite officers contemplating that alcohol may have contributed to the crash. The police watchdog report noted he had consumed 13 schooners of XXXX Gold and eight mixed-spirit drinks prior to the crash. The case has been marked by extraordinary secrecy, with the court initially refusing to reveal which courtroom two earlier mentions were held in. In October, media contacted the office of the state attorney general, Michael Daley, to express concern that access had effectively been denied by the court. The registrar then provided the room location for subsequent mentions. However, AB\u2019s case has not been listed on the online public registry which provides information regarding when and where a matter is to be heard. The prosecutor on Thursday raised this issue with the magistrate, stating the suppression order \u2013 which restricts the disclosure of any information that could identify the accused \u2013 did not preclude the matter from being listed under the pseudonym AB. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly not the case in the terms of the [suppression] order, and this is a matter with significant public interest and it has had extensive media interest \u2026 and the director\u2019s view is that this matter should be dealt with in the same way as any other matter that comes before the court,\u201d Graylin said on Thursday. Magistrate Daniel Covington agreed a suppression order did not mean the matter should be kept off the court list. \u201cIf it is not on the court list, it probably should be,\u201d Covington said. Under the suppression order for AB\u2019s case, the commissioner of police is to be \u201cnotified of any application for access to the court file and is to have the opportunity to be heard prior to any decision on access\u201d. Sam Lee, a solicitor at Redfern Legal Centre and expert in police accountability, said in mid-October: \u201cWhen it has been alleged an officer has committed an offence, the principle of open justice requires that an officer be subject to the same level of transparency as the general public. Without openness, integrity wilts away.\u201d AB\u2019s matter was scheduled to return to court for a hearing on 22 November.",

      "body": "<p>Donald Trump said he will nominate Florida congressman Matt Gaetz to be the US attorney general on Wednesday, tapping a far-right loyalist to one of the most powerful positions in US government.</p> <p>Late on Wednesday evening, Gaetz resigned from Congress, ending the ethics inquiry by the House ethics committee over allegations including sexual misconduct.</p> <p>Gaetz\u2019s nomination is one of the most significant to date. As attorney general, he would be the country\u2019s chief law enforcement officer and oversee the legal positions that the government takes on key issues, including abortion, civil rights laws, and first amendment issues. The president-elect has pledged to use the justice department to prosecute his political enemies and there is little doubt that Gaetz will help him fulfill that pledge.</p> <p>First elected to Congress in 2016, Gaetz represents a ruby-red district in the Florida panhandle and has become known as one of Congress\u2019s most showboating members. He reportedly sought a pardon from Trump over his efforts to overturn the election, and has embraced conspiracy theories about the attack on the US Capitol. Last year, he led a successful effort to oust fellow Republican Kevin McCarthy from the speakership, throwing his caucus into chaos.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/13/trump-america-first-foreign-policy\">Loyalty the key as impulsive Trump picks team for America First agenda</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gaetz\u2019s nomination comes a little over a year after the justice department decided not to charge him as part of a sex-trafficking investigation that involved allegations he had sex with a 17-year-old girl. Joel Greenberg, a former friend and ally, pleaded guilty to sex trafficking and was sentenced to 11 years in prison. Gaetz has denied the allegations.</p> <p>Gaetz has vehemently denied wrongdoing in the House ethics committee investigation over allegations that he \u201cengaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Trump heaped praise on Gaetz.</p> <p>\u201cMatt is a deeply gifted and tenacious attorney, trained at the William &amp; Mary College of Law, who has distinguished himself in Congress through his focus on achieving desperately needed reform at the Department of Justice,\u201d Trump said in a statement posted to his Truth Social media account.</p> <p>He added: \u201cFew issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System. Matt will end Weaponized Government, protect our Borders, dismantle Criminal Organizations and restore Americans\u2019 badly-shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department.\u201d</p> <p>The nomination was immediately met with widespread criticism.</p> <p>\u201cThis guy has been on the run from the law for quite some time now, so he\u2019ll think he\u2019s above it. He\u2019ll be corrupt as hell,\u201d said Olivia Troye, a former official in the Department of Homeland Security during the Trump administration who has become an outspoken critic of the former president.</p> <p>Robert Weissman, the co-president of the watchdog group Public Citizen said it was \u201chard to imagine a worse and more unqualified candidate\u201d than Gaetz.</p> <p>\u201cAs a member of Congress, Gaetz has demonstrated contempt for the rule of law, truth and decency.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump said he will nominate Florida congressman Matt Gaetz to be the US attorney general on Wednesday, tapping a far-right loyalist to one of the most powerful positions in US government. Late on Wednesday evening, Gaetz resigned from Congress, ending the ethics inquiry by the House ethics committee over allegations including sexual misconduct. Gaetz\u2019s nomination is one of the most significant to date. As attorney general, he would be the country\u2019s chief law enforcement officer and oversee the legal positions that the government takes on key issues, including abortion, civil rights laws, and first amendment issues. The president-elect has pledged to use the justice department to prosecute his political enemies and there is little doubt that Gaetz will help him fulfill that pledge. First elected to Congress in 2016, Gaetz represents a ruby-red district in the Florida panhandle and has become known as one of Congress\u2019s most showboating members. He reportedly sought a pardon from Trump over his efforts to overturn the election, and has embraced conspiracy theories about the attack on the US Capitol. Last year, he led a successful effort to oust fellow Republican Kevin McCarthy from the speakership, throwing his caucus into chaos. Gaetz\u2019s nomination comes a little over a year after the justice department decided not to charge him as part of a sex-trafficking investigation that involved allegations he had sex with a 17-year-old girl. Joel Greenberg, a former friend and ally, pleaded guilty to sex trafficking and was sentenced to 11 years in prison. Gaetz has denied the allegations. Gaetz has vehemently denied wrongdoing in the House ethics committee investigation over allegations that he \u201cengaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct\u201d. Meanwhile, Trump heaped praise on Gaetz. \u201cMatt is a deeply gifted and tenacious attorney, trained at the William &amp; Mary College of Law, who has distinguished himself in Congress through his focus on achieving desperately needed reform at the Department of Justice,\u201d Trump said in a statement posted to his Truth Social media account. He added: \u201cFew issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System. Matt will end Weaponized Government, protect our Borders, dismantle Criminal Organizations and restore Americans\u2019 badly-shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department.\u201d The nomination was immediately met with widespread criticism. \u201cThis guy has been on the run from the law for quite some time now, so he\u2019ll think he\u2019s above it. He\u2019ll be corrupt as hell,\u201d said Olivia Troye, a former official in the Department of Homeland Security during the Trump administration who has become an outspoken critic of the former president. Robert Weissman, the co-president of the watchdog group Public Citizen said it was \u201chard to imagine a worse and more unqualified candidate\u201d than Gaetz. \u201cAs a member of Congress, Gaetz has demonstrated contempt for the rule of law, truth and decency. He is singularly unqualified to lead an agency that enforces civil rights laws and environmental protection statutes. Under Gaetz, we\u2019d have every reason to expect an America where corporate criminals walk free but immigrants and people of color are harassed or rounded up with minimal pretext,\u201d he said in a statement. In January, Republicans will take control of the US Senate, which will vote on Gaetz\u2019s confirmation. They appear headed towards holding at least 53 seats, which would give them enough votes to confirm the Florida congressman, even if a few Republican senators vote against him. Gaetz also has a history of making derogatory and offensive remarks towards women. \u201cWhy is it that the women with the least likelihood of getting pregnant are the ones most worried about having abortions? Nobody wants to impregnate you if you look like a thumb,\u201d he said in 2022. As a Florida lawmaker before he was in Congress, he opposed a revenge porn law, reportedly telling the bill\u2019s sponsor that ex-lovers could do what they pleased with images their partners had shared with them. \u201cAre you not entertained?\u201d said CNN political analyst and Trump ally Scott Jennings in the wake of the news.

      "bodyText": "The Ukrainian foreign minister, Andrii Sybiga, said Ukraine has a \u201cclear picture\u201d of forthcoming military aid as he held talks with Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, who was in Brussels on Wednesday. \u201cWe have a clear picture \u2013 a clear timeframe, clear volumes \u2013 of what will be delivered to Ukraine by the end of the year. This helps us strategically to plan our actions on the battlefield,\u201d he said. The assistance, he added, would include weapons and funds for arms production deals. Sybiga said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d after discussing with Blinken the possibility of conducting deep strikes on Russia, as well as Euro-Atlantic integration. Blinken said in Brussels on Wednesday: \u201cPresident Biden has committed to making sure that every dollar we have at our disposal will be pushed out the door between now and Jan 20\u201d when president-elect Donald Trump is due to be sworn in. Nato countries must focus their efforts on \u201censuring that Ukraine has the money, munitions and mobilised forces to fight effectively in 2025, or to be able to negotiate a peace from a position of strength\u201d, Blinken said during the flying visit. The US will \u201cadapt and adjust\u201d with the latest equipment it is sending, Blinken said, without providing details. He also reiterated the call for others to step up. \u201cWe\u2019re counting on European partners and others to strongly support Ukraine\u2019s mobilisation,\u201d Blinken said \u2013 calling for more artillery, more air defences, more munitions as well as training for Kyiv\u2019s forces. Sybiga stressed the need for more air defence systems after the latest night attack on Ukraine. \u201cRussia is using Iranian drones, North Korean ballistic missiles and troops to attack Ukraine,\u201d Sybiga said. \u201cUkraine\u2019s defence cannot be put on hold.\u201d Blinken said he had discussed North Korea\u2019s actions with the Nato chief, Mark Rutte, after Pyongyang\u2019s troops had been \u201cinjected into the battle, and now, quite literally, in combat\u201d. Blinken called it \u201ca profound and incredibly dangerous development\u201d that \u201cdemands, and will get, a firm response\u201d. Ukrainian forces on Wednesday repelled an attempt by Russian troops to pierce defences near the north-eastern city of Kupiansk, Ukraine\u2019s general staff said. The Russians attacked in four waves and deployed about 15 pieces of equipment, including tanks, armoured vehicles and a mine-clearing system. Some of the Russian forces, it said, had, donned uniforms resembling those of the Ukrainian military, a practice it characterised as amounting to a war crime. DeepState, a popular Ukrainian military blog, backed up the report, saying two columns of Russian men and equipment had entered Kupiansk after dark. The general staff also reported on heavy military activity further south in Pokrovsk, a major target of Russian advances, with Ukrainian forces said to have repelled all but one of 36 attacks. The Reuters news agency said it could not independently verify battlefield reports. In the Donetsk region, prosecutors said a Russian attack killed two residents in the village of Shevchenko, west of the region\u2019s Russian-occupied main city, Donetsk. A senior Russian naval officer decried as a \u201cwar criminal\u201d by Ukraine was killed in a car bombing in Crimea, Pjotr Sauer writes. An official in Ukraine\u2019s security services told Ukrainian Pravda that the spy agency had orchestrated the car bomb attack in the Russian-controlled port city of Sevastopol that killed Valery Trankovsky, the chief of staff of the 41st Missile Brigade of the Russian navy\u2019s Black Sea fleet. The official said Trankovsky had ordered missile strikes from the Black Sea at civilian targets in Ukraine. Russia for the first time in 73 days put together a sophisticated combined aerial attack on Ukraine including Kyiv using both missiles and drones. Air raid warnings blared for hours as Russia targeted eight regions of Ukraine in all, firing six ballistic and cruise missiles and 90 drones, the Ukrainian air force said. Air defences downed four missiles and 37 drones, and another 47 drones were stopped by electronic jamming, the statement said. Kyiv officials said one man was wounded by falling debris from a drone in the suburb of Brovary, while emergency services distributed images of firefighters battling flames at one impact site. A drone attack in the Ukrainian-controlled southern region of Kherson killed a 52-year-old woman, the regional head said. A London-based Russian chef who has been highly critical of Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine has been found dead while on a visit to Serbia\u2019s capital, according to several sources on Wednesday. Alexei Zimin\u2019s body was found late on Tuesday in a flat that he was renting while visiting Belgrade, a source close to the investigation told the Agence France-Presse news agency. Prosecutors told the BBC that the flat was locked from the inside and the death did not appear to be suspicious, but that an autopsy would take place. Zimin had several restaurants in Moscow but left after Russia occupied Ukraine\u2019s Crimea peninsula in 2014.",

      "bodyText": "Apple is facing a near-\u00a33bn lawsuit over claims it breached competition law by effectively locking millions of UK consumers into its cloud storage service at \u201crip-off\u201d prices. The legal claim is being brought by Which?. The consumer group claimed that about 40 million Apple customers in the UK could be entitled to a payout averaging \u00a370 each if the action is successful. However, Apple said it rejected the Which? accusations and would \u201cvigorously defend\u201d itself against any legal claim. A similar lawsuit relating to this issue was launched against Apple in the US in March this year but has not yet concluded. Which? has instructed an international law firm and said the class action involved all UK consumers who had paid for iCloud services since 1 October 2015. Built into every Apple device, iCloud is the US tech company\u2019s cloud storage service that lets people keep photos, files and other data securely online so they are backed up and available when needed. Users get 5GB of storage for free, but to get more, they must pay, with a range of plans costing from 99p a month to \u00a354.99 a month. Plan prices were increased by up to 29% last year \u2013 a rise described by some media outlets as a \u201cshock price hike\u201d affecting millions of people. The Which? legal claim was filed with the competition appeal tribunal \u2013 a specialist UK judicial body that decides cases involving competition or economic regulatory issues. The lawsuit argued that Apple had breached UK competition law \u201cby giving its iCloud storage service preferential treatment, \u2018trapping\u2019 customers with Apple devices into using iCloud\u201d. It said Apple\u2019s iOS mobile operating system \u201chas a monopoly \u2026 and it is incumbent on Apple not to use that dominance to gain an unfair advantage in related markets, like the cloud storage market\u201d. Which? said Apple had been encouraging users to sign up to iCloud \u201cwhile simultaneously making it difficult to use alternative providers, including because Apple does not allow customers to store or back up all of their phone\u2019s data with a third-party provider\u201d. The consumer group also claimed that the resulting lack of competition had \u201cled to consumers being overcharged\u201d. Monthly iCloud subscription fees for UK consumers were increased by between 20% and 29% in June 2023. Which? said it was seeking damages for all affected Apple users, and estimated individual consumers \u201ccould be owed an average of \u00a370, depending on how long they have been paying for the services during that period\u201d. The consumer group is making use of the so-called \u201copt-out collective actions\u201d regime introduced by the Consumer Rights Act 2015, under which an organisation can represent consumers where large numbers of people have allegedly been harmed. All those eligible are automatically included in the claim unless they choose to opt out. Which? has instructed the law firm Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher, with the claim funded by Litigation Capital Management, a leading provider of \u201cdispute finance\u201d. But Which? said it was urging Apple \u201cto resolve this claim without the need for litigation by offering consumers their money back and opening up iOS to allow users a real choice for cloud services\u201d. Anabel Hoult, the consumer group\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe believe Apple customers are owed nearly \u00a33bn.\u201d In a statement, Apple said: \u201cOur users are not required to use iCloud, and many rely on a wide range of third-party alternatives for data storage. \u201cIn addition, we work hard to make data transfer as easy as possible \u2013 whether it\u2019s to iCloud or another service. We reject any suggestion that our iCloud practices are anti-competitive and will vigorously defend against any legal claim otherwise.\u201d The company said nearly 50% of its customers do not need nor pay for an iCloud+ subscription.
