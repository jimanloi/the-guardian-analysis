Here\u2019s more from Weiss:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The defendant did not docket the pardon nor has the government seen it. If media reports are accurate, the Government does not challenge that the defendant has been the recipient of an act of mercy. But that does not mean the grand jury\u2019s decision to charge him, based on a finding of probable cause, should be wiped away as if it never occurred. It also does not mean that his charges should be wiped away because the defendant falsely claimed that the charges were the result of some improper motive.

Donald Trump and his allies have long fixated on the president\u2019s son, and Trump has repeatedly pledged to use his second term to investigate and prosecute members of the Biden family. Conservative commentators have engaged in parlor-game speculation that Hunter Biden could be charged with bribery, illegal lobbying or other crimes stemming from his foreign business activities and drug addiction. </p> <p>So rather than merely pardoning his son for the gun crimes for which he was convicted and the tax crimes for which he pleaded guilty, the president\u2019s pardon covers all \u201coffenses against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in\u201d from Jan. 1, 2014, through Dec. 1, 2024. That language mirrors the language in Ford\u2019s pardon of Nixon, which did not merely cover the Watergate scandal but extended to \u201call offenses against the United States\u201d that Nixon \u201chas committed or may have committed\u201d between Jan. 20, 1969, and Aug. 9, 1974 \u2014 the exact span of Nixon\u2019s presidency.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-674db6938f08613772569281\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-12-02T13:35:07.309Z\">1.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Joe Biden is currently in the air, heading for Luanda, Angola, as part of a last-minute visit to sub-Saharan Africa that will be the first by any US president in nine years.</strong></p> <p>White House press secretary <strong>Karine Jean-Pierre</strong> is scheduled to take questions at some point during the flight from Sal, Cabo Verde, where Biden made a brief stop earlier today.

three felony counts he faced relating to buying a handgun while being a user of crack cocaine.</p> <p>Biden was accused of making two false statements when filling out a form to buy a Colt revolver in October 2018: first by stating untruthfully that he was not addicted to or using drugs, and then by declaring the statement to be true. </p> <p>A third charge alleged that he then illegally owned the gun for 11 days, before his sister-in-law and then lover, Hallie Biden, threw it in a trash bin in a panic.</p> <p>The prosecution called other members of the Biden family, including his former wife, Kathleen Buhle, to whom he was married for 24 years, and Hallie Biden, the widow of his brother Beau, as it tried to show that Hunter\u2019s drug use had continued during 2018 and 2019.</p> <p>The testimony painted a portrait of Hunter Biden falling deeper into addiction as he struggled to cope with the death of Beau, who died from brain cancer in 2015.</p> <p>After the breakup of his marriage,

Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form. Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently.</em></p> <p><em>The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the court room \u2013 with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process. Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter\u2019s cases.</em></p> <p><em>No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter\u2019s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son \u2013 and that is wrong. There has been an effort to break Hunter \u2013 who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they\u2019ve tried to break me \u2013 and there\u2019s no reason to believe it will stop here.

      "bodyText": "Joe Biden\u2019s pardon of his son Hunter Biden, who pleaded guilty to federal tax evasion charges and was convicted of firearms charges, has been met with both condemnation and support. Critics and allies have weighed in on political implications, precedents set, and how the move might impact the outgoing president\u2019s legacy. Here\u2019s what else has happened today: Donald Trump has named the billionaire investment banker Warren A Stephens \u2013 who poured millions of dollars into GOP coffers during the last election cycle \u2013 as his nomination as ambassador to Britain. A \u201cpreviously undisclosed whistleblower report\u201d on Pete Hegseth, Trump\u2019s pick for defense secretary, highlighted allegations of financial mismanagement, sexual impropriety, and personal misconduct, which forced him to step down from two non-profits he ran. American-Israeli soldier Omer Neutra, who was thought to have been a hostage in Gaza, is now feared to have died in the Hamas terrorist attack on 7 October 2023. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden will announce more pardons and grants of clemency in the final weeks before he leaves office. Trump has named the billionaire investment banker Warren A Stephens as his nomination as ambassador to Britain. Making the announcement on Truth Social, Trump called Stephens the \u201cone of the most successful businessmen in the Country\u201d, and said he had always dreamed of serving the United States full-time. Stephens is the chair, president and CEO of Stephens Inc, a privately owned financial services firm headquartered in Little Rock, Arkansas, but he\u2019s also a big political spender with a history of throwing millions behind the candidates and causes he favors. He hasn\u2019t always been on team Trump, even donating against him in the early years, but Stephens poured millions of dollars into GOP coffers during the last election cycle \u2013 including at least $3m donated to the Super Pac Make America Great Again Inc. Once called the \u201cking of Little Rock, Arkansas\u201d, the NYT wrote of Stephens\u2019s wealth, and his tactics for hiding it, in 2017, reporting: Mr Stephens used an opaque holding company to own an approximately 40 percent stake in a loan business accused by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau of cheating working-class and poor Americans. While earning millions from the investment, Mr Stephens helped finance a political onslaught against the bureau, never mentioning his personal connection to the fight. Trump highlighted in his announcement post that Stephens \u201chas built a wonderful financial services firm, while selflessly giving back to his community as a philanthropist\u201d. Speaking on CNN, the congressman Dan Goldman voiced support for the pardon, citing how the incoming administration may double down with politically motivated actions. \u201cI find it pretty ironic and hypocritical that so many Republicans have seemed to find the rule of law when it comes to Joe Biden\u2019s pardoning of Hunter, and are happily ignorant of the rule of law when it comes to Donald Trump and everything he has done,\u201d he said. Goldman pointed to Kash Patel, Trump\u2019s pick to head the FBI, as a danger \u201cwho is out for revenge\u201d. \u201cIt is yet another example of how Donald Trump is a danger to our rule of law.\u201d As reported by the Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington, Patel is a \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy theorist and Trump loyalist who has long denigrated the FBI as a pillar of the \u201ccorrupt ruling class\u201d. He has threatened to fire its top echelons and shut down the agency\u2019s headquarters, and has publicly pledged to prosecute political opponents and members of the media who he considers enemies of the Administration. West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin said he understood the president\u2019s pardon, telling CNN\u2019s Manu Raju that he wasn\u2019t going to \u201ccast stones\u201d, but that Biden would better protect his legacy if he also pardoned Trump. \u201cThe bottom line is this, Joe Biden is still a father and that paternal it kicked in and that\u2019s what it is,\u201d Manchin said, adding that it would be balanced by \u201cthrowing everything out on Trump\u201d: What I would have done differently and my recommendation as the council would have been, why don\u2019t you go ahead and pardon Donald Trump for all his charges and make it you know, it would have gone down a lot more balanced, if you will \u2026 Rather than going through all these court cases and getting, you know, the president has to be the president for the next four years, fighting all these criminal and all this other stuff\u2019s coming after him, just clean that slate up. Let\u2019s get this behind us and move forward. That\u2019s what I \u2013 that would have been my recommendation. Despite the worrying allegations leveled against him, Donald Trump\u2019s pick for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, continues to make the rounds of Republican senators whose votes will be vital to his confirmation. He was on Capitol Hill today, meeting with the Alabama senator Tommy Tuberville: Joe Biden\u2019s decision to pardon his son after months of saying he would do no such thing amounts to a brazen broken promise by the outgoing president. It also resembles just the sort of thing Donald Trump would do, the Guardian\u2019s David Smith reports: A loving act of mercy by a father who has already known much sorrow? Or a hypocritical political manoeuvre reminiscent of his great foe? Maybe both can be true. Joe Biden\u2019s announcement on Sunday that he had pardoned his son Hunter, who is facing sentencing in two criminal cases, is likely to have been the product of a Shakespearean struggle between head and heart. On the one hand, Biden is one of the last great institutionalists in Washington. \u201cFrom the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department\u2019s decision-making,\u201d he said in an unusually direct and personal statement on Sunday. To undermine the separation of powers goes against every fibre of his political being. On the other hand, Biden is nothing without family. His speeches are peppered with references to his parents. As a senator, he once took a train from Washington to Wilmington, Delaware, so he could see his daughter Ashley blow out the candles on a cake made for her eighth birthday, then cross the platform and take the next train back to work. At a White House holiday season event earlier today with families of National Guard members, reporters asked first lady Jill Biden about Joe Biden\u2019s decision to pardon his son, Hunter. \u201cOf course I support the pardon of my son,\u201d Jill Biden replied. Hunter Biden is the son of Joe Biden and his first wife, Neilia Hunter Biden, who died in a crash crash in 1972 along with the president\u2019s daughter, Naomi. Joe and Jill Biden have been married since 1977. David Weiss, the justice department special counsel who successfully prosecuted Hunter Biden on fraud and gun charges, hit back at Joe Biden\u2019s assertion that his son has been unfairly prosecuted. In a filing opposing the dismissal of Hunter Biden\u2019s tax fraud case in California, Weiss said: The defendant filed eight (8) motions to dismiss the indictment, making every conceivable argument for why it should be dismissed, all of which were determined to be meritless. Of note, the defendant argued that the indictment was a product of vindictive and selective prosecution. The Court rejected that claim finding that \u201c[a]s the Court stated at the hearing, Defendant filed his motion without any evidence. And there was none and never has been any evidence of vindictive or selective prosecution in this case. Biden pleaded guilty to the tax charges, after a jury in Delaware earlier this year found him guilty of lying about his drug use on a background check form he filled out to purchase a firearm. In the filing, Weiss argued against dismissing the tax case, saying that it should instead be closed, with no further action taken against Biden. Here\u2019s more from Weiss: The defendant did not docket the pardon nor has the government seen it. If media reports are accurate, the Government does not challenge that the defendant has been the recipient of an act of mercy. But that does not mean the grand jury\u2019s decision to charge him, based on a finding of probable cause, should be wiped away as if it never occurred. It also does not mean that his charges should be wiped away because the defendant falsely claimed that the charges were the result of some improper motive. No court has agreed with the defendant on these baseless claims, and his request to dismiss the indictment finds no support in the law or the practice of this district. An increasing number of Democrats is voicing their objections to Joe Biden\u2019s decision to pardon his son, Hunter Biden, who was expected to soon be sentenced on federal tax and gun charges. In a statement released last night, the president said he had opted to pardon Hunter because he believed he was a victim of \u201cselective prosecution\u201d that was intended to undermine his sobriety. In the hours since, several Democrats have said they disagreed with its decision, because it undermined Biden\u2019s stated commitment to the rule of law. Among those newly speaking out are Vermont senator Peter Welch, who wrote on X: President Biden\u2019s pardon of his son Hunter is, as the action of a loving father, understandable\u2014but as the action of our nation\u2019s Chief Executive, unwise. And Colorado congressman Jason Crow: The Hunter Biden pardon was a mistake. I sympathize with a father\u2019s love, especially in a family that has experienced so much personal tragedy. I also understand the legal arguments in favor of a pardon. But Presidential pardons are never judged solely on the merits of the case, particularly when it involves a family member. Presidents hold enormous power and responsibility and must be held to a higher standard. They must instill trust and promote the American people\u2019s faith in their democracy. And right now, upholding the fabric of our democracy is one of our most important tasks. We have yet to hear from the top Democrats in Congress, House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer. Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker who remains influential in the party, also has not commented publicly. While Donald Trump did not mention Hamas specifically, the group is plainly aware that he will soon be the next US president, and in a recently released video, an Israeli-American hostage appealed to Trump to make a deal for his release. Here\u2019s more, from the Guardian\u2019s Edward Helmore: The White House has condemned a Hamas-issued propaganda video of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander urging president-elect Donald Trump and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to make a deal to free remaining hostages in Gaza, calling it \u201ca cruel reminder of Hamas\u2019s terror against citizens of multiple countries, including our own\u201d. In the video, titled \u201cSoon \u2026 Time is running out\u201d and posted on Saturday on the Telegram channel of Hamas\u2019s military wing, the Qassam Brigades, Alexander calls on Trump to use his \u201cinfluence and the full power of the United States to negotiate for our freedom\u201d. Alexander, who has been held by Hamas since 7 October 2023, appears to be under duress as he states that he has been held captive for more than 420 days. \u201cPlease do not make the mistake Biden has been doing,\u201d he says, adding that he does not want to \u201cend up dead like my fellow USA citizen, Hersh\u201d, a reference to American-Israeli Hersh Goldberg Polin, who was killed while being held by Hamas in August. Alexander\u2019s family authorized the release of the video, which includes footage of the young captive covering his face with his hands and crying. Donald Trump has issued a vague threat to groups who have taken hostages in the Middle East, telling them, to release their captives before his inauguration or else \u201cthere will be ALL HELL TO PAY\u201d. The message, posted on Truth Social, follows news that Omer Neutra, a US-Israeli citizen believed to be taken captive by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, has been dead since the 7 October attack. Dozens of other hostages, a small number of whom have US citizenship, are believed to remain the group\u2019s captivity. Here\u2019s what Trump wrote, on Truth: Everybody is talking about the hostages who are being held so violently, inhumanely, and against the will of the entire World, in the Middle East - But it\u2019s all talk, and no action! Please let this TRUTH serve to represent that if the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity. Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW! Jamie Raskin, the Maryland congressman and long-time critic of Donald Trump, is seeking to become the top Democrat on the House judiciary committee, CNN reports. The network said it obtained a letter from Raskin declaring his intention to challenge New York representative Jerry Nadler for the role as ranking member, setting up what it calls an \u201cintraparty fight\u201d. Raskin wrote that he had spent a week consulting colleagues and \u201cengaging in serious introspection\u201d about running for the senior committee role: This is where we will wage our front-line defense of the freedoms and rights of the people, the integrity of the Department of Justice and the FBI, and the security of our most precious birthright possessions: the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, the rule of law, and democracy itself. The New Yorker has published details from a \u201cpreviously undisclosed whistleblower report\u201d that allegedly led to the departure of Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump\u2019s pick for defense secretary, from two veterans\u2019 advocacy groups. The Fox News host faced \u201cserious allegations of financial mismanagement, sexual impropriety, and personal misconduct\u201d that saw him forced to step down from Veterans for Freedom and Concerned Veterans for America (CVA), two nonprofits he ran. A \u201ctrail of documents\u201d includes claims Hegseth was \u201crepeatedly intoxicated while acting in his official capacity \u2013 to the point of needing to be carried out of the organization\u2019s events\u201d, during his 2013-2016 presidency of the CVA, the New Yorker reported. Under Hegseth\u2019s leadership, the seven-page report alleges, the organization became a \u201chostile workplace that ignored serious accusations of impropriety, including an allegation made by a female employee that another employee on Hegseth\u2019s staff had attempted to sexually assault her\u201d at a Louisiana strip club. Tim Parlatore, an attorney for Hegseth, told the magazine the claims were \u201coutlandish\u201d and fueled by a \u201cpetty and jealous disgruntled former associate\u201d. Read my colleague Jessica Glenza\u2019s story here: Joe Biden, aboard Air Force One, has landed in Luanda for a two-day visit to Angola, Reuters reports. It is his first and only trip to the African continent as US president. He will deliver remarks at the National Slavery Museum in Luanda and travel to the port city of Lobito to highlight US investments in the region, the news agency said. Joe and Jill Biden say they are \u201cdevastated and outraged\u201d by the reported death of American-Israeli soldier Omer Neutra, who was thought to have been a hostage in Gaza but who is now feared to have died in the Hamas terrorist attack on 7 October 2023. In a White House statement Monday, the president and first lady said Neutra, a Long Island native and Israeli Defense Forces tank commander who was 21 on the day of the attack, had planned to return to the US for college, and was dedicated \u201cto building peace\u201d: Less than a month ago, Omer\u2019s mother and father joined me at the White House to share the pain they\u2019ve endured as they prayed for the safe return of their son \u2013 pain no parent should ever know. They told me how Omer\u2019s grandparents were Holocaust survivors and how their family\u2019s strength and resilience has been carried through the generations. During this dark hour \u2013 as our nation joins Omer\u2019s parents, brother, and family in grieving this tragic loss \u2013 we pray to find strength and resilience. And to all the families of those still held hostage: We see you. We are with you. And I will not stop working to bring your loved ones back home where they belong. Joe Biden\u2019s pardon of his son Hunter Biden, who pleaded guilty to federal tax evasion charges and was convicted of firearms charges, has attracted condemnation from his Republican adversaries and even from some Democrats. The White House defended the move, with press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre saying \u201cit was not an easy decision to make\u201d, and that Biden still has confidence in the justice department even after he said his son was a victim of \u201cselective prosecution\u201d. The president is en route to Angola as he makes the first visit by a US president to sub-Saharan Africa since 2015. Here\u2019s what else has happened today so far: Jean-Pierre said Biden will announce more pardons and grants of clemency in the final weeks before he leaves office. Some Democrats have defended Biden\u2019s pardon of his son, including New Jersey congressman Josh Gottheimer. Legal experts said the Biden\u2019s pardon of his son was unusual in its scope, and comparable only to the pardon former president Gerald Ford gave to his predecessor, Richard Nixon. At least one Democratic congressman has come out to say he understands why Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter Biden. That would be Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, who told CNN: I\u2019ve said, I\u2019m always for accountability. But what I\u2019m not for are political prosecutions. And, let\u2019s be honest, the only reason why they went after Hunter the way they did, and I\u2019ve talked to many federal prosecutors about this, is because he\u2019s the president\u2019s son, right? It\u2019s somebody who has a lifelong drug addiction, and prosecutors would have handled this differently. So, this was all politically motivated. So, I understand. \u2026 He should have been handled \u2013 given his addiction, he should have been \u2013 this shouldn\u2019t have been handled differently. This was a political prosecution. The ranks of Democrats objecting to Joe Biden\u2019s pardon of his son Hunter Biden are increasing, albeit not dramatically. The latest to speak out is Colorado senator Michael Bennet, who said on X: President Biden\u2019s decision put personal interest ahead of duty and further erodes Americans\u2019 faith that the justice system is fair and equal for all. Interestingly, the state\u2019s Democratic governor Jared Polis was among the first in the party to condemn Biden for the decision. Presidents can grant clemency and issue pardons at any time, but traditionally step up the tempo as they near the end of their time in the White House. Jean-Pierre said that Biden will make more decisions about these cases in the weeks to come. \u201cHe\u2019s thinking through that process very thoroughly. There\u2019s a process in place, obviously, and so \u2026 I\u2019m not going to get ahead of the president on this, but you could expect more announcements, more pardons and clemency \u2026 at the end of this term,\u201d she said. As she continued taking questions from reporters, Jean-Pierre signaled that Joe Biden decided to pardon his son as it became clear that his political enemies would continue prosecuting him. It appeared to be a nod towards the incoming Donald Trump administration, who could pursue further legal action against Hunter Biden once they take office. \u201cWe have seen in last five years or so, the president\u2019s political opponents say this \u2026 this is not the President saying it. They said it themselves. They were going after Hunter Biden and so he made this decision,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. Taking questions from reporters aboard Air Force One as Joe Biden travels to Angola, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is attempting to explain why the president changed his mind and opted to pardon his son. Biden has said for months that he would not exercise his presidential powers to end the prosecutions of his son on tax fraud and gun charges, even as it became clear that Hunter Biden could serve jail time after pleading guilty to the former, and being convicted of the latter. Jean-Pierre, who as recently as last month said Joe Biden would not pardon his son, partially explained why he changed his mind. \u201cHe wrestled with it. It was not an easy decision to make,\u201d Jean-Pierre said, while declining to say if the president discussed the decision with Hunter as they spent Thanksgiving together. In his statement pardoning Hunter, Biden criticized the \u201cselective prosecution\u201d of his son. Asked if the president still has confidence in the justice department, Jean-Pierre said: \u201cThe president does believe in the justice system and the Department of Justice. And he also believes that his son was singled out politically.\u201d From the Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington, here\u2019s more on Kash Patel, Donald Trump\u2019s choice to lead the FBI who may wind up being his most controversial nominee since his short-lived pick of Matt Gaetz to lead the justice department: Donald Trump\u2019s plan to nominate as FBI director the \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy theorist Kash Patel, a virulent critic of the bureau who has threatened to fire its top echelons and shut down the agency\u2019s headquarters, is facing blowback in Congress as US senators begin to flex their muscles ahead of a contentious confirmation process. Politicians from both main parties took to the Sunday talk shows to express starkly divergent views on Patel, whom Trump announced on Saturday as his pick to lead the most powerful law enforcement agency in the US. The move is dependent on the incumbent FBI chief, Christopher Wray, who Trump himself placed in the job in 2017, either being fired or resigning. It is already clear that confirming Patel through the US Senate is likely to be less than plain sailing. Mike Rounds, a Republican senator from South Dakota, indicated that Patel could face a tough confirmation battle. Rounds pointedly sang the praises of the existing FBI director in an interview with ABC\u2019s This Week. He said that Wray, who still has three more years of his 10-year term to serve, was a \u201cvery good man\u201d, adding that he had \u201cno objections about the way that he is doing his job right now\u201d. The senator also emphasised the separation of powers between president and Senate, signaling possible trouble for Patel. Rounds said he gave presidents \u201cthe benefit of the doubt\u201d, but also emphasised that \u201cwe have a constitutional role to play \u2026 that\u2019s the process\u201d. Other Republican senators rallied to Patel\u2019s side. Ted Cruz, the senator from Texas, told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation that he believed Patel would be confirmed. \u201cPatel is a very strong nominee to take on the partisan corruption of the FBI.\u201d Another story to watch this week is the reaction of Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Kash Patel to lead the FBI. An unabashed Trump loyalist, Patel has claimed that the federal law enforcement agency is biased against Trump, and vowed to close its Washington headquarters and prosecute some agents as well as journalists. Patel worked as a national security and defense official in the first Trump administration, where some of his colleagues described him as unqualified for the job he was holding. Those complaints may come back to haunt him when the Senate gets around to considering his nomination. The Wall Street Journal heard from two of Patel\u2019s former colleagues, who offered starkly different views of his qualifications to lead the nation\u2019s premier federal law enforcement agency: \u201cHe\u2019s coming from outside the system,\u201d said Michael Spivack, who worked with Patel when he was a federal public defender in Florida more than a decade ago. \u201cIf you really want to change the system, you need bright intelligent people coming from the outside.\u201d But some who supervised Patel during the first Trump administration warn that he is unfit for the job. \u201cHe\u2019s absolutely unqualified for this job. He\u2019s untrustworthy,\u201d said Charles Kupperman, who served as Trump\u2019s deputy national-security adviser and worked closely with Patel. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute disgrace to American citizens to even consider an individual of this nature,\u201d he said. A second Democratic congressman representing a swing district has objected publicly to Joe Biden\u2019s pardon of his son Hunter Biden. Greg Landsman, who just won re-election representing to a district encompassing the city of Cincinnati, wrote of the pardon on X: As a father, I get it. But as someone who wants people to believe in public service again, it\u2019s a setback. More top House Republicans joined in on condemning Joe Biden\u2019s pardon of his son Hunter. Including the majority leader, Steve Scalise, who wrote on X: You\u2019ve been lied to every step of the way by this Administration and the corrupt Biden family. This is just the latest in their long coverup scheme. They never play by the same rules they force on everyone else. Disgraceful. And judiciary committee chair Jim Jordan, a leader of the effort to impeach the president for alleged corruption. He said: Democrats said there was nothing to our impeachment inquiry. If that\u2019s the case, why did Joe Biden just issue Hunter Biden a pardon for the very things we were inquiring about? House Republicans have spent the past two years attempting to prove that Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas business dealings and legal troubles are evidence of wider corruption involving Joe Biden and his family. They never turned up enough evidence to prove the link, and their attempt to impeach the president fell flat. Leading the pursuit of the president and his son was House speaker Mike Johnson, who had this to say about Joe Biden\u2019s decision to pardon Hunter: President Biden insisted many times he would never pardon his own son for his serious crimes. But last night he suddenly granted a \u201cFull and Unconditional Pardon\u201d for any and all offenses that Hunter committed for more than a decade! Trust in our justice system has been almost irreparably damaged by the Bidens and their use and abuse of it. Real reform cannot begin soon enough! Legal experts who spoke to Politico noted the scope of Joe Biden\u2019s pardon of his son Hunter, saying that it is comparable only to the pardon Gerald Ford granted to his White House predecessor, Richard Nixon. Rather than pardoning his son of the individual offenses that he faced, as is typical, Biden pardoned him of offenses over a period of more than 10 years \u2013 likely so the incoming Trump justice department can\u2019t levy new charges against him. Here\u2019s more, from Politico: Experts on pardons said they could think of only one other person who has received a presidential pardon so sweeping in generations: Nixon, who was given a blanket pardon by Gerald Ford in 1974. \u201cI have never seen language like this in a pardon document that purports to pardon offenses that have not apparently even been charged, with the exception of the Nixon pardon,\u201d said Margaret Love, who served from 1990 to 1997 as the U.S. pardon attorney, a Justice Department position devoted to assisting the president on clemency issues. \u201cEven the broadest Trump pardons were specific as to what was being pardoned,\u201d Love added. Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cfull and unconditional pardon\u201d of his son is deliberately vague. Donald Trump and his allies have long fixated on the president\u2019s son, and Trump has repeatedly pledged to use his second term to investigate and prosecute members of the Biden family. Conservative commentators have engaged in parlor-game speculation that Hunter Biden could be charged with bribery, illegal lobbying or other crimes stemming from his foreign business activities and drug addiction. So rather than merely pardoning his son for the gun crimes for which he was convicted and the tax crimes for which he pleaded guilty, the president\u2019s pardon covers all \u201coffenses against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in\u201d from Jan. 1, 2014, through Dec. 1, 2024. That language mirrors the language in Ford\u2019s pardon of Nixon, which did not merely cover the Watergate scandal but extended to \u201call offenses against the United States\u201d that Nixon \u201chas committed or may have committed\u201d between Jan. 20, 1969, and Aug. 9, 1974 \u2014 the exact span of Nixon\u2019s presidency. Joe Biden is currently in the air, heading for Luanda, Angola, as part of a last-minute visit to sub-Saharan Africa that will be the first by any US president in nine years. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is scheduled to take questions at some point during the flight from Sal, Cabo Verde, where Biden made a brief stop earlier today. No doubt reporters will pepper her with questions about the president\u2019s decision to pardon his son \u2013 something Jean-Pierre was saying as recently as a few weeks ago that he would not do. Gaggles on Air Force One are not held on camera, and it\u2019s unclear if this one will be broadcast live in an audio-only format. We\u2019ll let you know what Jean-Pierre has to say when we find out. This post has been corrected to say it has been nine years since a US president visited sub-Saharan Africa, not eight. In the hours since Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter, signs have emerged that some Democrats are not pleased with the decision. Among the first lawmakers to speak out against it was congressman Greg Stanton, who represents a swing district in Arizona. He said: I respect President Biden, but I think he got this one wrong. This wasn\u2019t a politically-motivated prosecution. Hunter committed felonies, and was convicted by a jury of his peers. We\u2019ll let you know what other Democrats have to say about Biden\u2019s pardon as the day goes on. Joe Biden\u2019s decision to pardon his son Hunter following his federal gun and tax cases may have sent shockwaves through Washington but it isn\u2019t the first time a president has used his power to help his family. As my colleague David Smith notes, Donald Trump pardoned the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner for tax evasion and retaliating against a cooperating witness. Bill Clinton as president also pardoned his half-brother Roger for cocaine charges in 2021, after he served his sentence ten years earlier. Clinton also pardoned his former business partner Susan McDougal, who had been sentenced to two years in prison for her role in the Whitewater real estate deal. You can read David\u2019s full analysis below With Donald Trump set to retake power in early 2025, its a reminder of how the legal travails faced by the president-elect interwove with those by Hunter Biden. Before he was prosecuted, Hunter Biden\u2019s legal team requested the federal gun and tax cases against him be thrown out after Trump-appointed judge Aileen Cannon dismissed a classified documents case in Florida. Both Biden and Trump were prosecuted by special counsels appointed by the US attorney general, Merrick Garland. In dismissing the Trump case, Cannon ruled that the appointment of the special counsel who prosecuted Trump, Jack Smith, violated the constitution because he was appointed directly to the position by Garland instead of being nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Biden\u2019s lawyers said on Thursday that that\u2019s exactly what happened in his case, as Weiss in his role as special counsel filed cases against Biden in California and Delaware and separately brought charges against a former FBI informant charged with lying about the Bidens. However, the move proved ultimately unsuccessful, with those two cases going ahead in June and September. The US constitution says that a president has the power to grant clemency, which includes both pardons and commutations. A pardon forgives federal criminal offenses; a commutation reduces penalties but isn\u2019t as sweeping. The power has its roots in English law \u2013 the king could grant mercy to anyone \u2013 and it made it over the ocean to the American colonies and stuck around. The US supreme court has found the presidential pardon authority to be very broad. Donald Trump granted 237 acts of clemency during his four years in office and Barack Obama granted clemency 1,927 times in his eight years. Presidents have forgiven drug offences, as mentioned in our post at 11.59 GMT, fraud convictions and Vietnam-era draft dodgers, among many other things. But a president can only grant pardons for federal offences, not state ones. Impeachment convictions also aren\u2019t pardonable. *The Associated Press Coming just weeks before he leaves office, Joe Biden\u2019s decision to pardon his son Hunter has already attracted controversy and driven debate in Washington. But it isn\u2019t first time he has exercised his power to benefit those convicted of criminal offences. He previously pardoned thousands of people given criminal records for marijuana use and possession on federal lands and also granted clemency to 11 people serving what the White House called \u201cdisproportionately long\u201d sentences for nonviolent drug offences. No one was freed from prison under last year\u2019s action, but the pardons were meant to help thousands overcome obstacles to renting a home or finding a job. Joe Biden\u2019s decision has split Democrats on Capitol Hill (we reported on some Republican reaction in our previous post). Jared Polis, the Democratic governor of Colorado, criticized Biden\u2019s decision. \u201cWhile as a father I certainly understand President Joe Biden\u2019s natural desire to help his son by pardoning him, I am disappointed that he put his family ahead of the country,\u201d Polis said on X, as reported by NBC News, which was the first to break the news of the presidential pardon. \u201cThis is a bad precedent that could be abused by later Presidents and will sadly tarnish his reputation.\u201d Arizona congressman Greg Stanton, also a Democrat said he thought Biden \u201cgot this one wrong.\u201d \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a politically-motivated prosecution,\u201d Stanton said, also on X. \u201cHunter committed felonies, and was convicted by a jury of his peers.\u201d However, former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, now an independent, wrote on X, \u201cJoe Biden pardoning Hunter looks bad but most fathers would do the same thing under the circumstances.\u201d If you\u2019re just waking up, here is a round-up of developments since US president Joe Biden announcing he was pardoning his son following his convictions for federal gun and tax offences. Joe Biden issued a pardon to son Hunter Biden on Sunday night, shortly before boarding a plane to Angola In a statement released shortly afterwards, Hunter said he would never take the clemency for granted President-elect Donald Trump responded by calling for the pardon and release of January 6 \u2018hostages\u2019 The move also attracted the ire of Republicans who targeted the Biden family throughout his presidency The US president has come under criticism for a perceived reversal over his stance on pardoning his son. As recently as 8 November, days after Trump\u2019s victory, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre ruled out a pardon or clemency for the younger Biden, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve been asked that question multiple times. Our answer stands, which is no.\u201d \u201cI said I\u2019d abide by the jury decision, and I will do that. And I will not pardon him,\u201d Biden also told reporters at the G7 summit in June When asked if he planned to commute Hunter Biden\u2019s sentence, the president mouthed \u201cno\u201d, according to the BBC. President-elect Donald Trump - as we reported earlier - responded angrily to Joe Biden\u2019s pardon. But he himself pardoned several allies and friends in own final days in office among the 70 people granted clemency in 2021. As this list details, they included former aide Steve Bannon, rapper Lil Wayne, and his daughter\u2019s father-in-law Charles Kushner, whom he has now nominated as ambassador for France. The use of presidential pardons have long been a feature of US politics, as my colleague Luke Harding previously reported, below. Here\u2019s the full text of Biden\u2019s pardon announcement: To All to Whom These Presents Shall Come, Greeting: Be It Known, That This Day, I, Joseph R. Biden, Jr., President of the United States, Pursuant to My Powers Under Article II, Section 2, Clause 1, of the Constitution, Have Granted Unto ROBERT HUNTER BIDEN A Full and Unconditional Pardon For those offenses against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024, including but not limited to all offenses charged or prosecuted (including any that have resulted in convictions) by Special Counsel David C. Weiss in Docket No. 1:23-cr-00061-MN in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and Docket No. 2:23-CR-00599-MCS-1 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF I have hereunto signed my name and caused the Pardon to be recorded with the Department of Justice. Done at the City of Washington this 1st day of December in the year of our Lord Two Thousand and Twenty-four and of the Independence of the United States the Two Hundred and Forty-ninth. Two months before Hunter arrived in court for his federal tax proceedings, he appeared in court with his mother Jill Biden and wife Melissa Cohen Biden, in Wilmington, Delaware. After three hours of deliberation and a week long trial, jurors found him guilty on all three felony counts he faced relating to buying a handgun while being a user of crack cocaine. Biden was accused of making two false statements when filling out a form to buy a Colt revolver in October 2018: first by stating untruthfully that he was not addicted to or using drugs, and then by declaring the statement to be true. A third charge alleged that he then illegally owned the gun for 11 days, before his sister-in-law and then lover, Hallie Biden, threw it in a trash bin in a panic. The prosecution called other members of the Biden family, including his former wife, Kathleen Buhle, to whom he was married for 24 years, and Hallie Biden, the widow of his brother Beau, as it tried to show that Hunter\u2019s drug use had continued during 2018 and 2019. The testimony painted a portrait of Hunter Biden falling deeper into addiction as he struggled to cope with the death of Beau, who died from brain cancer in 2015. After the breakup of his marriage, he formed a romantic relationship with Hallie Biden, who admitted to having smoked crack with him. Full story below What tax offenses did Hunter Biden plead guilty to? As we reported earlier, Hunter Biden was due to be sentenced for his conviction on federal gun charges on 12 December, with his sentencing on the tax case due on 16 December. The 54-year-old pleaded guilty to nine federal tax charges on 5 September on what was a day fraught with confrontation with prosecutors. The charges carried a possible 17 year prison sentence. Biden was accused of failing to pay his taxes on time from 2016 to 2019, as well as facing two felony counts of filing a false return and an additional felony count of tax evasion. He initially pleaded not guilty to the charges and his attorneys had indicated they would argue he did not act \u201cwillfully\u201d, or with the intention to break the law, in part because of his well-documented struggles with alcohol and drug addiction. Read the full details below Joe Biden, in his statement earlier, took aim at his political opponents for selectively targeting Hunter Biden for prosecution over gun purchase offenses. Those same opponents have now responded by accusing the president of lying about his family\u2019s activity during his political career. \u201cJoe Biden has lied from start to finish about his family\u2019s corrupt influence peddling activities,\u201d said Representative James Comer, chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability in a post on X. \u201cNot only has he falsely claimed that he never met with his son\u2019s foreign business associates and that his son did nothing wrong, but he also lied when he said he would not pardon Hunter Biden. \u201cThe charges Hunter faced were just the tip of the iceberg in the blatant corruption that President Biden and the Biden Crime Family have lied about to the American people.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to pardon those convicted after storming the US Capitol in Washington on January 2021 and took the opportunity to raise the issue. \u201cDoes the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years? \u201cSuch an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!\u201d Trump said in a post on his Truth Social social media platform. A loving act of mercy by a father who has already known much sorrow? Or a hypocritical political manoeuvre reminiscent of his great foe? Maybe both can be true. Joe Biden\u2019s announcement on Sunday that he had pardoned his son Hunter, who is facing sentencing in two criminal cases, is likely to have been the product of a Shakespearean struggle between head and heart. On the one hand, Biden is one of the last great institutionalists in Washington. \u201cFrom the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department\u2019s decision-making,\u201d he said in an unusually direct and personal statement on Sunday. To undermine the separation of powers goes against every fibre of his political being. On the other hand, Biden is nothing without family. His speeches are peppered with references to his parents. As a senator, he once took a train from Washington to Wilmington, Delaware, so he could blow out the candles on a birthday cake for his eight-year-old daughter, Ashley, at the station, then cross the platform and take the next train back to work. Biden was profoundly shaped by the death of his first wife, Neilia Hunter Biden, and 13-month-old daughter Naomi in a car accident and, much later, the death of his son Beau from brain cancer. In that context, Hunter\u2019s status as the first child of a sitting president to face criminal charges will have pained his father in what Ernest Hemingway called \u201cthe broken places\u201d. Read my full analysis below Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter. From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department\u2019s decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted. Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form. Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently. The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the court room \u2013 with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process. Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter\u2019s cases. No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter\u2019s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son \u2013 and that is wrong. There has been an effort to break Hunter \u2013 who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they\u2019ve tried to break me \u2013 and there\u2019s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough. For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth. They\u2019ll be fair-minded. Here\u2019s the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice \u2013 and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further. I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision. Hunter Biden issued a statement following his father\u2019s announcement: \u201cI have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction - mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport,\u201d Hunter Biden said in a statement on Sunday, adding he had remained sober for more than five years. \u201cIn the throes of addiction, I squandered many opportunities and advantages ... I will never take the clemency I have been given today for granted and will devote the life I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and suffering.\u201d Hello and welcome to our live coverage of US politics. On Sunday night, before boarding a plane to Angola, US president Joe Biden issued a pardon to his son Hunter \u2013 something he had repeatedly said he would not do. Biden said he hoped the American people would understand his decision to issue the pardons over convictions on federal gun and tax charges. \u201cNo reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter\u2019s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son \u2013 and that is wrong,\u201d he said. Hunter Biden was scheduled to be sentenced for his conviction on federal gun charges on 12 December. He was scheduled to be sentenced in the tax case four days later. Joe Biden is just weeks away from leaving office.",

      "bodyText": "Ada Konstantine could vote, drink and drive a car. But as they were 19 years old, their employer, Grill\u2019d, was legally able to pay them just $16.50 an hour \u2013 $3.38 less than the hourly national minimum for their age. If Konstantine worked at the fast food chain\u2019s airport store, their rate bumped up an extra $2. While employed at Grill\u2019d, Konstantine never got weekend or public holiday rates. \u201cSo the most I ever got paid to work at Grill\u2019d was $18.50 an hour, and I was living out of home, paying rent, paying bills,\u201d Konstantine says. The reason Konstantine got paid less than minimum wage was simple: their employment at Grill\u2019d was contingent on completing a certificate three in hospitality. Grill\u2019d, a nationwide burger chain, and other employers are legally allowed to use government-subsided training to pay these workers less than minimum wage. Unions are calling for the abolishment of junior rates (often known as a training wage) for over-18s and want an end to traineeships because the schemes exploit young workers, they claim. They also want the minimum wage for people aged 18 to 21 raised in line with the $24.10 adult wage. But business groups argue that paying young workers more would cut their employment opportunities. Konstantine says they had to sign up to the traineeship to get the job at Grill\u2019d. \u201cThey were very insistent upon it,\u201d Konstantine says. \u201cI asked if I could opt out of it, and they said, \u2018Unfortunately not.\u2019 \u201cSo it was either I took the [traineeship] or I didn\u2019t have a job at Grill\u2019d.\u201d Because Konstantine didn\u2019t get penalty rates on weekends or public holidays, they supplemented their wage with the youth allowance. \u201cI ate a lot of pasta and a shit tonne of rice,\u201d they said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to exaggerate anything, it truly was pure misery. It really sucked.\u201d A Grill\u2019d spokesperson said its traineeship program \u201cprovides foundational training\u201d. \u201cGrill\u2019d would like to clarify that all team members have a choice regarding their employment pathway and team members will be recruited in different ways depending upon their skills and experience,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cGrill\u2019d is committed to the ongoing development of trainees and supporting them through their learning journey.\u201d This year Konstantine started a new job. The higher casual rate has meant they can afford to eat and live better and start studying at university. Under current laws, workers younger than 21 get a percentage of the $24.10 hourly adult minimum wage: 20-year-olds are paid $23.55, 19-year-olds receive $19.88 and 18-year-olds get $16.46. Backed by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the SDA \u2013 one of the unions for retail, fast food and warehouse workers \u2013 has lodged an application at the Fair Work Commission seeking to remove junior rates for employees aged 18 and older, lifting all ages to $24.10 an hour. The SDA also want rates for 16-year-olds lifted to 50% of the minimum wage, up from 47.3%, and 75% for 17-year-olds, up from 57.8%. Felicity Sowerbutts, the director at the Youth Workers Centre, points to a 2022 report from the McKell Institute which showed young workers were earning $3.5bn less compared with what they would earn on the adult rates. She said the majority of that was going into the pockets of big businesses including Coles, Woolworths and McDonald\u2019s, who could afford to pay workers properly. \u201cThey are large companies \u2026 worldwide companies, they can afford to pay young workers a living wage,\u201d Sowerbutts says. The United Workers Union wants an overhaul of the traineeship system. Tim Kennedy, the UWU\u2019s national secretary, accused employers of \u201cexploiting a loophole in workplace laws to pay people well below what\u2019s needed to get by\u201d. Those systems, he says, were \u201cforcing people on to traineeships\u201d and \u201crelying on the disparity that\u2019s created with junior rates\u201d. Zahra is a manager on a part-time contract at Hungry Jack\u2019s in regional Victoria. This month, after turning 18, her pay went up 10% to $19 an hour. \u201cWe are one of the best-paid fast food [businesses] and we still don\u2019t get paid that much,\u201d she says. Zahra is saving and wants to buy a house by the time she turns 23. But without an adult wage saving is difficult, she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re working full-time, you\u2019d be getting [about] 30% less than an adult would,\u201d she says. The difference over a year \u201ccould be thousands of dollars\u201d. A spokesperson for Hungry Jack\u2019s says it is \u201ctransparent in its workplace agreements and complies with relevant legislation\u201d. Bran Black, the chief executive of the Business Council, which represents employers, says raising the minimum rate would disincentive businesses to employ younger, less-experienced staff. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen such a huge amount of industrial relations change over the last two years that businesses are saying we just can\u2019t take any more,\u201d he told the ABC. Kerry Brown, a professor of employment and industry at Edith Cowan University, says the youth rate was established to boost employment. Youth unemployment in October was 9.3%, more than double the 4.1% for adults. Employing young people helps them to gather experience and fosters mentoring in the workplace, she says. \u201cAs you gather that experience, you work towards the adult rate.\u201d Without the lower rates, Brown says youth unemployment will go higher. But Konstantine, who can now afford to live in a rental with their partner instead of a rundown share house, says the low rates of pay held them back. There was no way they would have been able to enrol at university while working at Grill\u2019d, they say. \u201cIt just wouldn\u2019t have been feasible.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Leo Puglisi was just 11 when he started an online news channel. What was a passion project in his last year of primary school has grown into a 24/7 streaming service that has reported through bushfires and a pandemic, and featured interviews with two prime ministers. Puglisi, now 17, has recruited 10 teenagers across Australia \u2013 almost all of whom are still in high school \u2013 to run 6 News across YouTube, X, Instagram, TikTok and a website. If the federal government had banned teenagers under the age of 16 from social media six years ago, his life now would be very different. \u201c6 News wouldn\u2019t have existed,\u201d Puglisi says. \u201cIt would have really just taken away something I love doing. It is something I\u2019m passionate about. It is something people turn to now as a source of news. But that would have all been stripped away.\u201d Last Thursday the federal government\u2019s social media ban for under-16s passed in the Senate. The bill is introducing the term \u201cage-restricted social media platforms\u201d into the Online Safety Act. This will apply to platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, X and Reddit. While the government introduced the bill due to major concerns about the mental health effects of social media on young people, some experts are wary the ban may backfire. For some teenagers creating content online, the ban may close doors on opportunities and stifle creativity and growth, they say. \u2018So many people have online communities\u2019 Puglisi\u2019s channel has been built by teenagers as young as 13 engaging with its work then reaching out to get involved. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cThey are all just other young people passionate about elections, or journalism and media, and really wanted to be able to do this,\u201d he says. The ban \u201cdoes stifle creativity for young people\u201d, Puglisi says. \u201cIt would just take all these opportunities away.\u201d Maggie Perry, 15, has been reporting for 6 News since she was 13. She says \u201cthere are just so many avenues\u201d of opportunity for teenagers on social media \u2013 \u201cso many infinite possibilities that just don\u2019t exist in the real world\u201d. \u201cI love having an audience to communicate my ideas [to],\u201d Perry says. But she \u201cmainly finds it really fun\u201d. \u201cSo many people have online communities \u2026 They might have niche interests but on social media there always is space for that.\u201d The social media ban, however, means she \u201cwouldn\u2019t be able to do anything for 6 News at all\u201d. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to use any of my platforms, except maybe YouTube.\u201d Maggie, who has reported on elections, is followed on social media by MPs. \u201cEven they, I guess, have voted for me to be banned from social media.\u201d For Will Haynes, a 16-year-old musician, social media has been a way to connect with artists and listeners globally. He has been making music since he was 13, and started posting to social media shortly after. \u201cIt has definitely opened doors for me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has definitely helped me connect with so many people in the industry and different artists, and it\u2019s also helped me expand my reach and get new people onboard. \u201cAnd there\u2019s an element of it that I really like in the sense that you can craft your online persona and your brand as an artist.\u201d Haynes opened for Budjerah in March and performed with him at the Vivid festival in Sydney this year. \u201cI feel like both those opportunities were through social media and Gmail,\u201d Haynes says. \u201cI also feel like my audience [is] sort of building in other countries \u2026 was probably thanks a lot to Instagram reels and YouTube.\u201d Haynes concedes there are downsides to social media. \u201cConstantly making content on social media is super exhausting,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cIt can also be demoralising if you don\u2019t get a huge audience.\u201d But he says a social media ban would have \u201cdefinitely impacted me as a young musician\u201d. \u201cMaybe it would have allowed me to focus more on the music itself \u2026 but I definitely think in a negative way it would have been so much harder to grow.\u201d \u2018We need to introduce them incrementally\u2019 The ban comes in response to concerns about the mental health effects of social media on young people, including issues surrounding body image, bullying and other harmful content. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said while social media could be \u201ca source of entertainment, education and connection with the world and each other\u201d for too many young Australians it could be harmful. Rowland also pointed to eSafety research showing parents found online safety one of their biggest challenges. But Prof Amanda Third, co-director of the Young and Resilient Research Centre at Western Sydney University, is wary that debate has been driven by parental anxiety. She is a signatory on an open letter by social media experts to politicians raising concern the ban may be harmful. \u201cI know that we are not doing enough as a society to support parents to do their job, to raise children in the digital age,\u201d she says. \u201cBut social media is firmly integrated into the everyday lives of children and young people. \u201cThey use it to facilitate a whole range of things that support their wellbeing, their proper growth and development, their rights to participation, their health, their education, a whole bunch of different things, including having fun.\u201d Third says she is aware of the \u201cvery clear counter-argument that all people have been learning about themselves without social media for millennia\u201d. \u201cBut the fact is, our children will grow into a world where digital technologies of various kinds and social media \u2026 are dominant. \u201cWe need to introduce them incrementally, with support and guidance into the world that they will inhabit.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Rachel Reeves is to appoint a health service and regulatory veteran, Tom Hayhoe, a former Conservative cabinet adviser, as her Covid corruption commissioner with the remit of clawing back billions in fraudulent contracts. The chancellor is understood to believe the Treasury can recoup \u00a32.6bn from waste, fraud and flawed contracts signed during the pandemic. The Treasury has previously said the commissioner will work with HMRC, the Serious Fraud Office and the National Crime Agency to examine an estimated \u00a37.6bn worth of Covid-related fraud. The Guardian understands Hayhoe will begin work on Tuesday initially reviewing \u00a3674m in contracts that had been previously written off by the Conservative government, with the aim of returning cash to the taxpayer. Hayhoe, who began his career as an adviser to the Tory cabinet minister Peter Walker under Margaret Thatcher, has had a prolific career in healthcare, procurement and scrutiny. He will also receive assessments of fraud recovery work to date in other major Covid loan schemes such as furlough, bounce-back loans, business support grants, eat out to help out, and Covid-era universal credit fraud. The award of lucrative Covid contracts was a significant controversy of the previous government. The Conservative peer Michelle Mone was involved in one contract with PPE Medpro, awarded contracts worth \u00a3200m. The company is the subject of a long-running investigation by the National Crime Agency. Annual accounts for the DHSC in January showed that nearly three-quarters of the money it spent on PPE during the pandemic had been written off. A Treasury source said: \u201cThe chancellor has been clear that she wants this money \u2013 that belongs to the British people, and belongs in our public services like our NHS, schools, and police \u2013 back. She won\u2019t let fraudsters who sought to profit off the back of a national emergency line their pockets. \u201cTom Hayhoe brings a wealth of experience and will leave no stone unturned as a commissioner with free rein to investigate the unacceptable carnival of waste and fraud during the pandemic.\u201d Labour pledged in its manifesto to appoint a fixed-term commissioner to recoup public money lost in pandemic-related fraud and from contracts that have not been delivered. Hayhoe will be in post on a one-year contract, reporting to the chancellor. He will then deliver a report to parliament, which will include recommendations for government procurement in the face of future crises. Hayhoe was chair of west London NHS Trust and of West Middlesex university hospital, as well as investigating committee chair on the Nursing and Midwifery Council\u2019s fitness to practise panel. He has also held senior positions at WH Smith and McKinsey and is chair of the Legal Services Consumer Panel. He has also chaired the Taxation Disciplinary Board, been an external assessor at the College of Policing, and a disciplinary committee chair for the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants. Reeves is expected to confirm the appointment at Treasury questions in the House of Commons on Tuesday, the Guardian understands. The previous government has always defended the Covid spend, citing the unique circumstances during a pandemic when globally PPE was in extremely short supply, which drove up costs and led to a rush to secure protective equipment for frontline health and care workers.",

I know what it is like when you have to fight for every result and where you have to work around the clock to get better, to improve, that\u2019s what I always was like in my playing days and also managing.

      "bodyText": "Ruud van Nistelrooy said he was \u201churt\u201d that Ruben Amorim\u2019s arrival at Manchester United triggered his exit after a promising interim spell. Van Nistelrooy impressed during his four games in charge after the sacking of Erik ten Hag, opening doors to various jobs in England and overseas, with Leicester winning the race for his services. Van Nistelrooy\u2019s first game in charge of his new club is at home against West Ham on Tuesday. Van Nistelrooy said that although he was disappointed to leave United he quickly came to terms with his departure after amicable talks with Amorim and is ready to \u201cwork around the clock\u201d to lift Leicester, who are a point above the Premier League relegation zone after Saturday\u2019s 4-1 defeat at Brentford. The Dutchman left Old Trafford with his reputation enhanced, \u201castonished\u201d at the spike in interest. \u201cI was disappointed, yeah, very much so, and it hurt that I had to leave,\u201d the 48-year-old said. \u201cThe only job I would take as an assistant was at United because of the bond that I have with the people in the club and the fans. But in the end I got my head round it because I also understand the new manager. I spoke to Ruben about it, the conversation was grateful, man to man, person to person, manager to manager, and that helped a lot to move on and straightaway get into talks with new possibilities which of course lifted my spirits.\u201d Van Nistelrooy, appointed on a two-and-a-half-year contract after rounds of discussions in London with Leicester\u2019s chairman, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, and the club\u2019s director of football, Jon Rudkin, said the ultimate target for a team promoted as champions last season is survival. Leicester are 16th in the Premier League after a run of six games without a win and Van Nistelrooy said he is ready for a relegation scrap. \u201cI think I have to go back to my first three years of my playing days in the Dutch championship [Eerste Divisie] \u2026 many people forget about that,\u201d he said. \u201cThey see \u2018Real Madrid, Manchester United\u2019, but my first three seasons in the Dutch second tier were with a club called FC Den Bosch, and my first season as a professional when I was 18 we were 18 of 18 [in the table].

The refrigerated vehicle was due to make a delivery to the chef\u2019s pop-up pie stall at York Christmas Market, but staff found it had disappeared from Barker business park in Melmerby, near Ripon, on Monday morning.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b0e621f0-9cb5-4820-a500-abe48af3ab1d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/a9W0Jxl9TSY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Banks urged the perpetrators to drop the pies somewhere such as a community centre, adding: \u201cI know you\u2019re a criminal, but maybe just do something nice because it\u2019s Christmas and maybe we can feed a few thousand people with these pies that you\u2019ve stolen, do the right thing.\u201d</p> \n<p>He also asked anyone who is offered pies from someone who is not him to report them to the police.</p> \n<p>The chef\u2019s video contained the caption: \u201cSo @matthewalockwood went into @madeinoldstead this morning to pick up the van and it has been stolen.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese guys had loaded up the van with stock for @tommyspieshop today and left plugged in overnight. I\u2019m guessing the thieves didn\u2019t realise they were stealing 2,500 pies along with the van! The pies are all in boxes with my name on so not very easy to sell.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you are the thieves and read this I urge you to drop the pies off somewhere.

      "bodyText": "A Michelin-starred chef has appealed to thieves who stole his van which had 2,500 pies inside to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and give them to people in need. Tommy Banks, who owns two restaurants and a pub in North Yorkshire, announced on Instagram that his van carrying \u00a325,000 worth of stock had been taken. The refrigerated vehicle was due to make a delivery to the chef\u2019s pop-up pie stall at York Christmas Market, but staff found it had disappeared from Barker business park in Melmerby, near Ripon, on Monday morning. Banks urged the perpetrators to drop the pies somewhere such as a community centre, adding: \u201cI know you\u2019re a criminal, but maybe just do something nice because it\u2019s Christmas and maybe we can feed a few thousand people with these pies that you\u2019ve stolen, do the right thing.\u201d He also asked anyone who is offered pies from someone who is not him to report them to the police. The chef\u2019s video contained the caption: \u201cSo @matthewalockwood went into @madeinoldstead this morning to pick up the van and it has been stolen. \u201cThese guys had loaded up the van with stock for @tommyspieshop today and left plugged in overnight. I\u2019m guessing the thieves didn\u2019t realise they were stealing 2,500 pies along with the van! The pies are all in boxes with my name on so not very easy to sell. \u201cIf you are the thieves and read this I urge you to drop the pies off somewhere. So we can at least give them to people who need food and they are not wasted.\u201d The chef, a veteran judge on BBC show Great British Menu, added the stolen items included pies filled with steak and ale, turkey and cranberry, and butternut squash, and would have been enough to stock Tommy\u2019s Pie Shop for a week. North Yorkshire police said it had been informed of the theft and asked anyone with information to get in touch, the BBC reported.",

      "body": "<p>Here is Robert Eggers\u2019s avowed passion project as writer-director: a luxury-arthouse remake on a grand scale, paying homage to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/24/nosferatu-eview\">FW Murnau\u2019s classic silent film from 1922</a>, the German expressionist nightmare of Count Orlok, or Nosferatu, the \u201cevil one\u201d, a pallid vampire living in the shadow of the Carpathian Mountains. Eggers\u2019s film can\u2019t quite bear to say the comedy word \u201cTransylvania\u201d out loud, though we get to glimpse it on a map. It is an interesting new Nosferatu for our age of pandemic fear, with some beautiful images and striking moments, particularly in the eerie moonlit hallucination sequence at the beginning, which makes the rest of the story feel slightly literal and self-conscious.</p> <p>The German stage actor Max Schreck was the vampire in the 1922 version, and Klaus Kinski was in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/31/nosferatu-the-vampyre-review\">Werner Herzog\u2019s 1979 remake</a>. Now it is Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd (known for playing Stephen King\u2019s scary clown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/06/it-review-film-scary-stephen-king-horror-clown-haunted\">Pennywise</a>) who stays semi-shadowed for much of the film. He is undead but intimidatingly athletic, like an animated corpse, ripped in every sense. He is not hairless in the traditional Orlok way, having a bushy moustache, and he speaks in a booming native tongue with borderline-ridiculous subtitles. It is the early 19th century, and the count plans to buy property in the fictional German port town of Wisborg with the help of a cringingly submissive secret acolyte there, to bring his ancient evil into the heart of enlightened Europe. Orlok tricks an innocent, wholesome young realtor into making the perilous journey to his castle to oversee the document signing in person, but he plans to set the seal on his imperial expansion with the ecstatically obscene blood-conquest of this man\u2019s demure young bride, for whom he has conceived a telepathic passion; she sees him in her dreams.</p>    <p>The Murnau movie was famously taken without permission from Bram Stoker\u2019s 1897 novel Dracula with the names changed to avoid lawsuits. But it kept most plot points, including the vampire\u2019s sea journey, which made sense when Dracula was heading to Yorkshire but is more puzzling when Orlok is travelling from Romania to Germany. Eggers keeps it here, with plague rats. Nicholas Hoult plays the fresh-faced property agent Thomas Hutter. Lily-Rose Depp is his wife Ellen, haunted by her sleepwalking and nameless sexual yearnings. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Emma Corrin play the couple\u2019s friends, the Hardings. Ralph Ineson is the local physician Dr Sievers. And Simon McBurney is Thomas\u2019s creepy employer, Herr Knock.</p> <p>Most importantly, Willem Dafoe plays occult expert and vampire-hunter Professor Von Franz, a heterodox outsider and freethinker who is the only one they can rely on; he is the equivalent of Stoker\u2019s Van Helsing and the great ancestor of Father Merrin in Friedkin\u2019s The Exorcist. (Dafoe actually played Schreck in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/feb/02/culture.peterbradshaw\">Shadow of the Vampire</a>, E Elias Merhige\u2019s 2000 movie about the making of Nosferatu.)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Px6S0RxfAHg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Px6S0RxfAHg?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Any adaptation of Nosferatu has to decide on what can only be called the Mel Brooks question: how far to lean in to the black comic horror and absurdity. Herzog did it marginally, and so does Eggers \u2013 surely \u2013 by giving Dafoe\u2019s professor a bizarrely long pipe to smoke (the equivalent, perhaps, of Klaus Kinski\u2019s unsettlingly tall wineglass in Herzog\u2019s Nosferatu). And Dafoe\u2019s occasional way of suddenly appearing in the side of the frame is a little Marty Feldman-esque, although Brooks never wrote anything like the line that Eggers gives to the local tavern landlord, yelling at the unruly locals: \u201cMay the mind of God bugger you!\u201d Macabre comedy works to mimic an uneasy giggle of fear, and to pre-empt possible derision or scepticism and to keep the powder of horror dry. More serious is the suggestion that Professor Von Franz\u2019s attitudes are more complicated than we thought.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/oct/31/nosferatu-silent-horror-movie-100-years\">Nosferatu at 100: a silent horror masterwork that continues to chill</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The film is handsomely produced and shot, with good performances, although for me Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s vampire is opaque and forbiddingly gruesome without being necessarily as scary as could be expected. Murnau\u2019s creation took the vampire into a more fabular realm of demon or monster, and away from the novelistic tradition of being a personable, patrician, plausibly human persona. Stoker\u2019s Count Dracula was a distant cousin to literary figures such as Mr Rochester and Maxim de Winter. Orlok is more abstractly brutish, and has to be so from the very beginning, but I feel that Eggers\u2019s vampire is more stylised, more studied, but less insidiously frightening than he needs to be, and there is less sense of his weakness \u2013 his passion for Depp\u2019s Ellen \u2013 becoming dangerous to him. What psychological subtlety there is gets transferred to the Freudian ordeal of Ellen, who is attracted yet disgusted by the vampire but realises the way in which these competing instincts must be reconciled. This is an elaborate, detailed love letter to the original, intelligently respectful and faithful.</p> <p>\u2022 Nosferatu is released on 25 December in the US, and on 1 January in Australia and the UK.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Here is Robert Eggers\u2019s avowed passion project as writer-director: a luxury-arthouse remake on a grand scale, paying homage to FW Murnau\u2019s classic silent film from 1922, the German expressionist nightmare of Count Orlok, or Nosferatu, the \u201cevil one\u201d, a pallid vampire living in the shadow of the Carpathian Mountains. Eggers\u2019s film can\u2019t quite bear to say the comedy word \u201cTransylvania\u201d out loud, though we get to glimpse it on a map. It is an interesting new Nosferatu for our age of pandemic fear, with some beautiful images and striking moments, particularly in the eerie moonlit hallucination sequence at the beginning, which makes the rest of the story feel slightly literal and self-conscious. The German stage actor Max Schreck was the vampire in the 1922 version, and Klaus Kinski was in Werner Herzog\u2019s 1979 remake. Now it is Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd (known for playing Stephen King\u2019s scary clown Pennywise) who stays semi-shadowed for much of the film. He is undead but intimidatingly athletic, like an animated corpse, ripped in every sense. He is not hairless in the traditional Orlok way, having a bushy moustache, and he speaks in a booming native tongue with borderline-ridiculous subtitles. It is the early 19th century, and the count plans to buy property in the fictional German port town of Wisborg with the help of a cringingly submissive secret acolyte there, to bring his ancient evil into the heart of enlightened Europe. Orlok tricks an innocent, wholesome young realtor into making the perilous journey to his castle to oversee the document signing in person, but he plans to set the seal on his imperial expansion with the ecstatically obscene blood-conquest of this man\u2019s demure young bride, for whom he has conceived a telepathic passion; she sees him in her dreams. The Murnau movie was famously taken without permission from Bram Stoker\u2019s 1897 novel Dracula with the names changed to avoid lawsuits. But it kept most plot points, including the vampire\u2019s sea journey, which made sense when Dracula was heading to Yorkshire but is more puzzling when Orlok is travelling from Romania to Germany. Eggers keeps it here, with plague rats. Nicholas Hoult plays the fresh-faced property agent Thomas Hutter. Lily-Rose Depp is his wife Ellen, haunted by her sleepwalking and nameless sexual yearnings. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Emma Corrin play the couple\u2019s friends, the Hardings. Ralph Ineson is the local physician Dr Sievers. And Simon McBurney is Thomas\u2019s creepy employer, Herr Knock. Most importantly, Willem Dafoe plays occult expert and vampire-hunter Professor Von Franz, a heterodox outsider and freethinker who is the only one they can rely on; he is the equivalent of Stoker\u2019s Van Helsing and the great ancestor of Father Merrin in Friedkin\u2019s The Exorcist. (Dafoe actually played Schreck in Shadow of the Vampire, E Elias Merhige\u2019s 2000 movie about the making of Nosferatu.) Any adaptation of Nosferatu has to decide on what can only be called the Mel Brooks question: how far to lean in to the black comic horror and absurdity. Herzog did it marginally, and so does Eggers \u2013 surely \u2013 by giving Dafoe\u2019s professor a bizarrely long pipe to smoke (the equivalent, perhaps, of Klaus Kinski\u2019s unsettlingly tall wineglass in Herzog\u2019s Nosferatu). And Dafoe\u2019s occasional way of suddenly appearing in the side of the frame is a little Marty Feldman-esque, although Brooks never wrote anything like the line that Eggers gives to the local tavern landlord, yelling at the unruly locals: \u201cMay the mind of God bugger you!\u201d Macabre comedy works to mimic an uneasy giggle of fear, and to pre-empt possible derision or scepticism and to keep the powder of horror dry. More serious is the suggestion that Professor Von Franz\u2019s attitudes are more complicated than we thought. The film is handsomely produced and shot, with good performances, although for me Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s vampire is opaque and forbiddingly gruesome without being necessarily as scary as could be expected. Murnau\u2019s creation took the vampire into a more fabular realm of demon or monster, and away from the novelistic tradition of being a personable, patrician, plausibly human persona. Stoker\u2019s Count Dracula was a distant cousin to literary figures such as Mr Rochester and Maxim de Winter. Orlok is more abstractly brutish, and has to be so from the very beginning, but I feel that Eggers\u2019s vampire is more stylised, more studied, but less insidiously frightening than he needs to be, and there is less sense of his weakness \u2013 his passion for Depp\u2019s Ellen \u2013 becoming dangerous to him. What psychological subtlety there is gets transferred to the Freudian ordeal of Ellen, who is attracted yet disgusted by the vampire but realises the way in which these competing instincts must be reconciled. This is an elaborate, detailed love letter to the original, intelligently respectful and faithful. \u2022 Nosferatu is released on 25 December in the US, and on 1 January in Australia and the UK.",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re closing our Middle East crisis liveblog now after a day in which Israel and Hezbollah traded fire in Lebanon, five days after a ceasefire was declared in the conflict. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve been following: Hezbollah said it launched two rockets near a watchtower in the occupied Shebaa farms earlier on Monday night. They landed in an open area and caused no injuries. In a statement, the group said the attack on the watchtowers was an \u201cinitial warning defensive response\u201d against \u201crepeated violations\u201d by Israel of the ceasefire agreement. In response, Israel said it targeted \u201cdozens of targets\u201d in southern Lebanon, claiming to have struck \u201cHezbollah terrorists, dozens of launchers, and terrorist infrastructure\u201d across the country. \u201cIsrael demands that the relevant parties in Lebanon fulfill their responsibilities and prevent Hezbollah\u2019s hostile activity,\u201d the army said in a statement. US officials said they believed the ceasefire, announced last Wednesday, had not broken down. \u201cIf we do see violations of the ceasefire, we\u2019ll go to the parties and tell them to knock it off,\u201d state department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters at an afternoon briefing. But the UN peacekeeping force, United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil), told CNN through an unnamed source said Israel has been serially in breach of the ceasefire agreement. The source said \u201capproximately 100\u201d incidents have been recorded. Please keep following the Guardian\u2019s news coverage for the latest developments in the Middle East crisis. Donald Trump is promising \u201cthere will be all hell to pay\u201d in the Middle East if hostages still being held in Gaza by Hamas are not released by his inauguration on 20 January. The president-elect made the statement in a post to his Truth Social network, but did not elaborate on what the threat entailed, other than to say those responsible would be \u201chit harder than anybody has been hit\u201d. Here\u2019s Trump\u2019s statement in full, random capital letters included: Everybody is talking about the hostages who are being held so violently, inhumanely, and against the will of the entire World, in the Middle East - But it\u2019s all talk, and no action! Please let this TRUTH serve to represent that if the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity. Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW! According to the Washington Post, there were believed to be 63 hostages still alive in Gaza as of 26 November. One of them, Israeli-American Omer Neutra, was reported killed Monday having previously thought to have been a hostage. The Israeli military said Monday it had \u201cstruck Hezbollah terrorists, dozens of launchers, and terrorist infrastructure throughout Lebanon\u201d, the Reuters news agency reported. The Israeli air force also \u201cstruck the Hezbollah launcher in the area of Berghoz in southern Lebanon shortly\u201d after the militant group targeted an Israeli position. \u201cIsrael demands that the relevant parties in Lebanon fulfill their responsibilities and prevent Hezbollah\u2019s hostile activity,\u201d the army said in a statement. There is intense scrutiny of the conduct of Israel and Hezbollah in the last day as various parties, both involved on the ground and in diplomatic circles, watch and debate to what extent the five-day-old ceasefire in Lebanon is holding. The UN peacekeeping force, United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil), has an unnamed source that\u2019s telling CNN that Israel has been serially in breach. The US state department is currently officially of the view that the ceasefire is holding, according to spokesman Matthew Miller. But unnamed US officials are telling Axios that the ceasefire could unravel or collapse. Israel\u2019s foreign minister, Gideon Sa\u2019ar, says Israel is \u201cenforcing\u201d the ceasefire. Fighting has had a heavy toll in Lebanon in the last 13 months, with almost 4,000 people killed by Israeli strikes, more than 1 million people displaced and \u00a36.7bn ($8.4bn) in damages. Residents of south Lebanon had just begun to return to their homes this week and begin repairs. In north Israel, more than 60,000 people remain displaced by Hezbollah rockets. The ceasefire mandates that Israeli troops leave south Lebanon and Hezbollah\u2019s fighters vacate the area south of the Litani River, about 18 miles north of the Israel-Lebanon border, within 60 days. The deal ended fighting that began after Hezbollah launched rockets at Israel on 8 October 2023 \u201cin solidarity\u201d with Hamas\u2019s attack a day prior. A key point of contention in the ceasefire has revolved around Israel\u2019s right to unilaterally enforce what it deems to be violations of the truce. Israeli officials have stressed that it will maintain the right to carry out attacks and reopen the front in Lebanon if it feels the ceasefire deal is not being respected. The head of Israel\u2019s military Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said: We will attack with great force in the face of Hezbollah\u2019s dangerous violations, this is what we will continue to do. We have plans and targets that are ready to be implemented at any moment.\u201d Hezbollah has said that Israel does not have the right to carry out attacks in Lebanon or fly its aircraft in Lebanese airspace, saying this would be an encroachment of Lebanese sovereignty. The resumption of tit-for-tat strikes in south Lebanon and north Israel has caused concern that full-fledged fighting between Hezbollah and Israel could resume just five days after a ceasefire was announced. The newest Israeli bombing constituted the most significant attacks since the ceasefire was established on Wednesday. The Israeli military had carried out several strikes over the past week, but at a lower intensity. Israeli media reported on Sunday that France, which is supposed to supervise the implementation of the deal, had accused Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement 52 times since its establishment. Residents of Lebanon continued to brace themselves for Israel\u2019s response to Hezbollah\u2019s attack on Monday night, with a witness telling the Guardian that people started leaving Dahiyeh, the southern suburbs of Beirut where Hezbollah enjoys strong support, shortly after Netanyahu vowed to retaliate. \u201cWe are tired, we can\u2019t handle any more of this. People barely just got back to their homes,\u201d said Ali, a resident of Beirut from Tyre, south Lebanon. Analysts have said that Hezbollah, weakened from more than a year of fighting, does not want to reignite a war with Israel but must play a balancing act by not appearing too docile in the face of continuing Israeli strikes. Western diplomats have reportedly cautioned Israel to be less aggressive in its attacks on Lebanon and urged it to allow the monitoring mechanism, which is meant to supervise the ceasefire, to begin its work. US Maj Gen Jasper Jeffers arrived in Beirut on 27 November to co-chair the ceasefire committee alongside the US envoy to the region, Amos Hochstein. During a briefing with reporters on Monday, US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said that the ceasefire had not broken down and the US-led enforcement mechanism would address violations. If we do see violations of the ceasefire, we\u2019ll go to the parties and tell them to knock it off,\u201d Miller says. Lebanon state media says Israel struck southern areas 20km (12.5 miles) from the border. Lebanese official media reported Israeli strikes on southern areas far from the border on Monday evening, hours after Hezbollah claimed an attack on an Israeli position days into a fragile ceasefire, AFP writes. Enemy warplanes launched strikes... (on) the outskirts of the town of Jbaa,\u201d as well as the Deir al-Zahrani area, the National News Agency said. The agency later also reported \u201ca series of air strikes\u201d close to two villages near Jbaa. The Israeli military said it was currently striking \u201cterror\u201d targets in Lebanon amid mutual accusations of ceasefire violations between Israel and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah. The announcement comes after a Hezbollah attack earlier in the day targeting an Israeli military position in a disputed area on the Israel-Lebanon border, the group\u2019s first since the truce took effect on Wednesday, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. Israel carried out a series of airstrikes in the Nabatieh district, south Lebanon, in response to Hezbollah rocket fire near a watchtower, the first time the group has attacked Israel since a ceasefire came into effect Wednesday morning last week. Hezbollah had launched two rockets near a watchtower in the occupied Shebaa farms earlier on Monday night. They landed in an open area and caused no injuries. In a statement, the group said the attack on the watchtowers was an \u201cinitial warning defensive response\u201d against \u201crepeated violations\u201d by Israel of the ceasefire agreement. An Israeli military spokesperson said that the army was attacking targets in Lebanon but would give \u201cfurther details later\u201d. An hour earlier, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu vowed a \u201cstrong\u201d response to Hezbollah\u2019s attack. The Israeli airstrikes constituted the most serious attacks since the ceasefire was established on Wednesday. The resumption of tit-for-tat strikes in south Lebanon and north Israel has caused concern that fully fledged fighting between Hezbollah and Israel could resume just five days after a ceasefire was announced.",

It\u2019s a power that presidents have deployed since George Washington, who pardoned those involved in the Whiskey Rebellion, to Donald Trump, who pardoned his political allies. What is the pardon power? The presidential pardon power is explicitly outlined in the US constitution. Section 2 of article II says that the president has the power to \u201cgrant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment\u201d. The president\u2019s power only applies to federal crimes, not state ones. It also does not apply to cases of impeachment.

On these accounts, one man appears to be a more eligible dispenser of the mercy of government, than a body of men,\u201d he wrote in Federalist no 74, one of a series of essays to promote the ratification of the constitution. When it came to treason, he argued that the president could deploy the pardon power as a tool to negotiate and unify the country. \u201cIn seasons of insurrection or rebellion, there are often critical moments, when a welltimed offer of pardon to the insurgents or rebels may restore the tranquillity of the commonwealth; and which, if suffered to pass unimproved, it may never be possible afterwards to recall,\u201d he wrote. Bernadette Meyler, a law professor at Stanford University who studies British and US law, described it as \u201cthe one emergency power written into the constitution, other than the suspension of habeas corpus. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing that is a concession to the idea that there might be certain unforeseen circumstances that the president would have to intervene in,\u201d she said. \u201cIt goes along with the president\u2019s control also over the army and navy and military power because, in the context that it was being contemplated, it was really being thought about as another tool within the ability to control domestic unrest.\u201d How has the pardon power been used? George Washington issued the first pardons in 1795 to two men who were involved in the Whiskey Rebellion, a violent uprising in Pennsylvania to protest a tax on whiskey and other alcohol products by the nascent federal government. A key moment in the pardon power came after the civil war, when president Andrew Johnson issued \u201ca full pardon and amnesty\u201d to any person \u201cwho, directly or indirectly, participated in the late insurrection or rebellion\u201d during the civil war. This and similar pardons around the same time led the US supreme court to interpret the pardon power to allow the president to grant broad amnesty to a group of people and not just for specific crimes already committed, Meyler said. After Richard Nixon resigned the presidency in the 1970s after Watergate, Gerald Ford issued a full and unconditional pardon for any crimes. In 1977, Jimmy Carter issued a mass pardon for those who had dodged the draft for the Vietnam war. At the end of his term in 1992, George HW Bush pardoned six people involved in the Iran-Contra affair, including the former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger. In his last day in office in 2001, Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother and gave an extremely controversial pardon to Marc Rich, a fugitive convicted of financial crimes whose ex-wife had been a major donor to Democrats and the Clinton campaign. Barack Obama granted clemency to more than 1,700 people while in office, including hundreds who had been convicted of non-violent drug offenses. Who did Donald Trump pardon? Trump did not hesitate to use the pardon power during his presidency to help political allies. He pardoned Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law Jared. The elder Kushner had pleaded guilty years earlier to tax evasion and witness tampering (Trump has now tapped him to be ambassador to France). He pardoned his political adviser Steve Bannon, who faced charges of defrauding donors on a charity related to building a wall at the southern border. He also pardoned Paul Manafort, who served as a top official on his 2016 campaign, and Trump ally Roger Stone. Trump pardoned the former New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik, the conservative personality Dinesh D\u2019Souza, and Elliott Broidy, a major Republican donor. He also pardoned the rapper Lil Wayne and Alice Marie Johnson, a woman who had spent decades in prison for drug offenses but earned considerable attention after Kim Kardashian took on her cause. Trump has said he will issue a mass pardon for those involved in the January 6 attacks, a move that would end years of work by the justice department to investigate and criminally prosecute those involved in the attacks. Do other countries have a pardon power? The power to pardon is one that widely exists around the world, said Andrew Novak, a professor at George Mason University who is the author of Comparative Executive Clemency: The Constitutional Pardon Power and the Prerogative of Mercy in Global Perspective. But the United States is somewhat unique in allowing its chief executive the ability to pardon without having to get input or sign-off from others. \u201cBiden can grant a pardon without input from anybody, which is much more of like a medieval English king conception of the pardon power, which is kind of ironic,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have kind of an old-fashioned conception of the pardon power, at least generally.\u201d \u201cHaving this unlimited pardon power that\u2019s more similar to like 1700s England than it is to the current state of affairs in the western world,\u201d he added. \u201cIn most countries in Europe, and the comparators in the developed world, they require input from someone else.\u201d That requirement for input, Novak said, can somewhat limit a pardon being used to serve political or personal interests, the way it can be used in the US. Many countries also don\u2019t allow for a pardon before conviction, Novak said, and there has been a movement over the last few decades in other countries for more transparency to ensure that proper processes are followed. About half of constitutions around the world limit the pardon power to something that can only occur after conviction, are only for specified offenses, or require an executive to consult others, Novak said. It\u2019s uncommon for countries to have a ban on self-pardoning or pardoning a family member, he added. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not common because the circumstance doesn\u2019t arise very often,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pardon power has always been a corruption risk going back to medieval times and can be used for many forms of self-dealing, like shielding one\u2019s close associates or supporters.\u201d The US founders understood impeachment to be an important check on the pardon power, Meyler said. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen it\u2019s extremely hard to actually convict on an impeachment so that has proved to be really a fictional limitation on the president\u2019s power.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Like crocuses pushing up through the soil, like a first glimpse of daffodil in spring, you know something\u2019s up at West Ham, and indeed Everton, when David Moyes starts turning up on Match of the Day 2 like a hopeful uncle at a funeral, looking trim and urgent and chiselled, with perhaps even a slight shade of spray-salon, a touch of Ibiza Whisper.</p> <p>Moyes did a thorough video debrief for the BBC of Virgil van Dijk\u2019s defending against Erling Haaland at Anfield. This wasn\u2019t the toughest analysis given it basically involved showing Van Dijk gliding about taking the ball away, doing Dad-defender stuff \u2013 Erling, we\u2019ve talked about this, you\u2019ll have to wait for Crystal Palace \u2013 and generally defanging an elite striker he just seems to have the cheat code to every time.</p> <p>It was a significant choice of headline act in other ways. There is a parallel track to Liverpool\u2019s progress right now. On one side, the Arne Slot rebuild. On the other, the Doomsday Clock countdown around contracts and retention of key parts of the succession; Van Dijk, Mohamed Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/02/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-sack-threat-premier-league\">Man City are spiralling. But what would it take for Guardiola to get the sack? | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If Van Dijk\u2019s performance had wider significance, it lies in the fact he is surely the easiest and most cost-effective to make an exception for. Here is a 33-year-old who is the defensive armature of this team and its spirit animal through all the recent good times. How do you replace this? Answer: you don\u2019t. Better to just put it off right up until the day you have no choice.</p> <p>Moyes didn\u2019t have time to present the best part of the Haaland-Van Dijk super-cut, the interception midway through the second half where Haaland seemed to have found a hole, spinning off Joe Gomez and haring in behind the Liverpool backline. At which point Haaland\u2019s line of vision was interrupted by that familiar figure in red, reaching a leg up to pull the ball out of the air, the kind of pre-defending that isn\u2019t function of speed or athleticism but of being so plugged into the game that every detail seems to happen only in draft form, all of it pending Van Dijk approval.</p> <p>Van Dijk and Haaland are easy threads to pick out of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/01/liverpool-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Sunday\u2019s game</a>. In part because one was sensationally, minimally good, the other sensationally, minimally absent. But also because both capture in their own ways the arc of these two teams right now.</p>    <p>Van Dijk\u2019s game was elite on the basic numbers. He completed 38 of 40 passes, made a total of 13 tackles, interceptions and clearances, and had four attempts at goal.

      "bodyText": "Like crocuses pushing up through the soil, like a first glimpse of daffodil in spring, you know something\u2019s up at West Ham, and indeed Everton, when David Moyes starts turning up on Match of the Day 2 like a hopeful uncle at a funeral, looking trim and urgent and chiselled, with perhaps even a slight shade of spray-salon, a touch of Ibiza Whisper. Moyes did a thorough video debrief for the BBC of Virgil van Dijk\u2019s defending against Erling Haaland at Anfield. This wasn\u2019t the toughest analysis given it basically involved showing Van Dijk gliding about taking the ball away, doing Dad-defender stuff \u2013 Erling, we\u2019ve talked about this, you\u2019ll have to wait for Crystal Palace \u2013 and generally defanging an elite striker he just seems to have the cheat code to every time. It was a significant choice of headline act in other ways. There is a parallel track to Liverpool\u2019s progress right now. On one side, the Arne Slot rebuild. On the other, the Doomsday Clock countdown around contracts and retention of key parts of the succession; Van Dijk, Mohamed Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold. If Van Dijk\u2019s performance had wider significance, it lies in the fact he is surely the easiest and most cost-effective to make an exception for. Here is a 33-year-old who is the defensive armature of this team and its spirit animal through all the recent good times. How do you replace this? Answer: you don\u2019t. Better to just put it off right up until the day you have no choice. Moyes didn\u2019t have time to present the best part of the Haaland-Van Dijk super-cut, the interception midway through the second half where Haaland seemed to have found a hole, spinning off Joe Gomez and haring in behind the Liverpool backline. At which point Haaland\u2019s line of vision was interrupted by that familiar figure in red, reaching a leg up to pull the ball out of the air, the kind of pre-defending that isn\u2019t function of speed or athleticism but of being so plugged into the game that every detail seems to happen only in draft form, all of it pending Van Dijk approval. Van Dijk and Haaland are easy threads to pick out of Sunday\u2019s game. In part because one was sensationally, minimally good, the other sensationally, minimally absent. But also because both capture in their own ways the arc of these two teams right now. Van Dijk\u2019s game was elite on the basic numbers. He completed 38 of 40 passes, made a total of 13 tackles, interceptions and clearances, and had four attempts at goal. Even the one big mistake, dawdling on the ball then seeing Caoimh\u00edn Kelleher make a really smart save from Kevin De Bruyne, turned into a good moment as Van Dijk got to be great about it, pointing in a check-this-dude way toward his goalkeeper, an error repurposed as great guy content. More to the point, Van Dijk\u2019s performance was entirely in keeping with his season so far. This is the other thing about Liverpool\u2019s progress under Slot, the obvious improvement of individuals, including mature Klopp-engineered parts. Van Dijk has been quietly sensational, a footballer re-peaking, striding about the place like the 17th Earl of Egham with a quiver of pheasants over one shoulder. He has the most passes of any player in the Premier League so far this season, although this is as much a reflection of Slot\u2019s influence, the added air in the system, time for the players to breathe in between the surges.

Damascus employed air support from Russia during a prolonged battle to retake Aleppo that ended in 2016, while Assad also deployed chemical weapons and siege tactics against his own people. Damascus has remained dependent on Iranian ground troops as well as backing from Iranian-allied Iraqi militias to support flagging Syrian army forces in its attempt to keep control of the country. The sudden loss of Aleppo left Assad and his regional partners, as well as their opponents, scrambling to adjust. After a meeting with Assad in Damascus on Sunday evening, the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, labelled their talks a \u201cuseful, frank and friendly\u201d discussion, adding that the Syrian president had \u201cadmirable \u2026 courage and spirit\u201d. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Iranian counterpart, Masoud Pezeshkian, on Monday pledged \u201cunconditional support\u201d for Assad\u2019s control of Syria during a phone conversation. The US and the United Arab Emirates meanwhile held talks to discuss lifting sanctions on Assad if he were to cut ties with Iran and stop the flow of weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon, according to five sources that spoke to Reuters. The sources said the insurgents\u2019 sweeping advance had shown a weakness in Assad\u2019s partnership with Iran that could be exploited, although this could be undermined should Assad look to Tehran for further assistance in the mounting counteroffensive. Nearly 50,000 people have been displaced in Syria in recent days, with the situation remaining \u201chighly fluid\u201d, the UN\u2019s humanitarian agency said Monday. The US state department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, said in a briefing on Monday that Assad was \u201ca brutal dictator with blood on his hands, the blood of innocent civilians\u201d and that Washington\u2019s stance on his rule had not changed. He said the US wanted to see a de-escalation of fighting, and negotiations between the government in Damascus and opposition forces to end the civil war. US sanctions on Syria remained fully in effect, he added, despite a looming potential expiry date later this month. \u201cThe Syrian regime has shown no change in behaviour that would indicate that our sanctions should change,\u201d he said. The Iraqi prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, also discussed the sudden changes in Syria with Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II, telling him that \u201cSyria\u2019s security and stability are closely linked to Iraq\u2019s national security and play a crucial role in regional security\u201d, according to his office. Araghchi arrived in Ankara for talks with the Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, early on Monday morning. Ankara had previously made public overtures towards Damascus while backing rebel groups along Syria\u2019s northern border. \u201cWe do not want to see an escalation of the civil war in Syria,\u201d said Fidan after their meeting, and called for Damascus to \u201creconcile with its own people and legitimate opposition\u201d. With Islamist opposition militants in control of Aleppo, the White Helmets said they had expanded their rescue efforts there after Syrian and Russian strikes on the city. An airstrike targeted a central neighbourhood of Aleppo for the second day in a row, causing material damage and sparking fears about further reprisals by Damascus. Alabdullah said: \u201cWe have a team in Aleppo and we\u2019re doing everything we can to respond, but the regime is still bombing so we know we are going to face more difficulties. The situation is very difficult.\u201d Fuad, a university lecturer living in western Aleppo who requested a pseudonym for his own safety, said Aleppo\u2019s new rulers had asked people to remain at home \u201cfor their safety, and to protect their property \u2026 people were allowed to go out to get food and necessities\u201d. \u201cI heard they gave reassurances to residents that they will be safe, which is really important at this stage as people are scared,\u201d he said. The White Helmets said they had also broadened their operations to try to assist tens of thousands of displaced people to return to their homes across north-western Syria. \u201cSupporting the return of forcibly displaced Syrians to their homes is one of our top priorities,\u201d they said in a statement. Oubadah Alwan, a spokesperson for the White Helmets, said it advocated caution in their returns because of unexploded ordnance. \u201cOur teams are working to clear and secure areas after attacks, but of course with so many attacks happening they are spread thin,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>In its manifesto, Labour promised to tighten the rules around political donations. Officials are now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/dec/02/government-may-cap-uk-political-donations-to-limit-foreign-influence\">examining a slate of ideas</a> including donation caps and further restrictions on foreign cash.</p> <p>Change will take time, as the plans are still at an early stage and ministers are not due to bring forward proposals until at least 2026. But speculation that Elon Musk could donate $100m to Nigel Farage\u2019s party, Reform UK, will trigger a fresh clamour for stricter rules.</p>  <h2>What are the current rules on political donations?</h2>  <p>The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 stipulates that all donations and loans to political parties worth more than \u00a3500 must come from \u201cpermissible sources\u201d.</p> <p>The key requirement for donors to be permissible, according to the Electoral Commission, is that they must be registered in the UK \u2013 either by being a voter on the electoral register or a UK company, trade union or LLP. They can also be unincorporated associations in the UK.</p> <h2>How could Musk make a donation to Reform?</h2>  <p>Two potential avenues have been floated: either through the UK arm of the social media company X or by securing UK citizenship, which his father Errol has said he is eligible for because his grandmother was British.</p> <h2>What has Labour said in the past?</h2>  <p>Labour has been critical of a reform <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/16/britons-living-abroad-regain-right-to-vote-in-uk-elections-as-15-year-rule-ends\">ushered in by the Conservatives</a> in 2022, which extended the franchise to overseas voters who have been away from the UK for more than 15 years. The change, which came after a protracted legal battle by the second world war veteran Harry Shindler, allowed Britons living abroad for more than 15 years to vote and donate to political parties.</p> <p>In opposition, Labour warned that this would \u201callow those with tenuous links to the UK, who have spent most of their lives in states that may even be openly hostile to our aims, the right to massively influence our system\u201d.</p> <p>Labour has also previously called on the election watchdog to look into instances where the Tories appeared to have received donations from shell companies and firms that had ceased to exist.</p> <h2>How much can donors give?</h2>  <p>There are no limits, but campaigners have argued for them to be introduced for decades.</p> <h2>What are some of the biggest political donations?</h2>  <p>Labour received millions during the last parliament from Gary Lubner, the former Autoglass boss; Dale Vince, the founder of gas and electricity supplier Ecotricity; David Sainsbury, the former chair of Sainsbury\u2019s supermarkets; and his daughter, Fran Perrin.</p> <p>The Conservatives benefited from a series of big donations from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/mar/11/biggest-tory-donor-looking-diane-abbott-hate-all-black-women\">controversial businessman Frank Hester</a>, who gave the party \u00a320m between the start of 2023 and the 2024 general election. Mohamed Mansour, who served as a minister under former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/mar/28/mohamed-mansour-who-donated-to-tories-knighthood\">gave the party \u00a35m</a>.</p> <p>One of the heftiest donations in recent history was \u00a38m from Sainsbury to the Liberal Democrats in the run-up to the 2019 election.</p> <h2>How does the UK compare to the US?</h2>  <p>Political funding in the US dwarfs that in the UK. Independent fundraising and campaigning groups called super political action committees (Super Pacs) can raise unlimited amounts of cash for presidential candidates \u2013 as long as they do not coordinate with candidates\u2019 campaigns and disclose their donors. Musk\u2019s Super Pac reportedly spent about $200m to help elect Donald Trump this year.</p> <p>There are concerns that the UK political donations system, which campaigners say is already not fit for purpose, is unprepared for the prospect of involvement from US billionaires such as Musk.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In its manifesto, Labour promised to tighten the rules around political donations. Officials are now examining a slate of ideas including donation caps and further restrictions on foreign cash. Change will take time, as the plans are still at an early stage and ministers are not due to bring forward proposals until at least 2026. But speculation that Elon Musk could donate $100m to Nigel Farage\u2019s party, Reform UK, will trigger a fresh clamour for stricter rules. What are the current rules on political donations? The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 stipulates that all donations and loans to political parties worth more than \u00a3500 must come from \u201cpermissible sources\u201d. The key requirement for donors to be permissible, according to the Electoral Commission, is that they must be registered in the UK \u2013 either by being a voter on the electoral register or a UK company, trade union or LLP. They can also be unincorporated associations in the UK. How could Musk make a donation to Reform? Two potential avenues have been floated: either through the UK arm of the social media company X or by securing UK citizenship, which his father Errol has said he is eligible for because his grandmother was British. What has Labour said in the past? Labour has been critical of a reform ushered in by the Conservatives in 2022, which extended the franchise to overseas voters who have been away from the UK for more than 15 years. The change, which came after a protracted legal battle by the second world war veteran Harry Shindler, allowed Britons living abroad for more than 15 years to vote and donate to political parties. In opposition, Labour warned that this would \u201callow those with tenuous links to the UK, who have spent most of their lives in states that may even be openly hostile to our aims, the right to massively influence our system\u201d. Labour has also previously called on the election watchdog to look into instances where the Tories appeared to have received donations from shell companies and firms that had ceased to exist. How much can donors give? There are no limits, but campaigners have argued for them to be introduced for decades. What are some of the biggest political donations? Labour received millions during the last parliament from Gary Lubner, the former Autoglass boss; Dale Vince, the founder of gas and electricity supplier Ecotricity; David Sainsbury, the former chair of Sainsbury\u2019s supermarkets; and his daughter, Fran Perrin. The Conservatives benefited from a series of big donations from the controversial businessman Frank Hester, who gave the party \u00a320m between the start of 2023 and the 2024 general election. Mohamed Mansour, who served as a minister under former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak, gave the party \u00a35m. One of the heftiest donations in recent history was \u00a38m from Sainsbury to the Liberal Democrats in the run-up to the 2019 election. How does the UK compare to the US? Political funding in the US dwarfs that in the UK. Independent fundraising and campaigning groups called super political action committees (Super Pacs) can raise unlimited amounts of cash for presidential candidates \u2013 as long as they do not coordinate with candidates\u2019 campaigns and disclose their donors. Musk\u2019s Super Pac reportedly spent about $200m to help elect Donald Trump this year. There are concerns that the UK political donations system, which campaigners say is already not fit for purpose, is unprepared for the prospect of involvement from US billionaires such as Musk.",

No, it\u2019s taking place at the home of the holders, Manchester United. They are one of several certified big boys dropping into the draw, eager to snuff out any final sparks of FA Cup fun. Still, the Cup still usually finds a way. The draw begins at 7pm-ish, GMT.</p> \n </div> \n</div>",

On BBC Two, Sarah and Vito have finished chatting about their training techniques, which means it\u2019s time to head over to Kelly Somers at an empty Old Trafford \u2026 1 Bournemouth 2 Arsenal 3 Aston Villa 4 Blackburn 5 Brentford 6 Brighton 7 Bristol City 8 Burnley 9 Cardiff 10 Chelsea 11 Coventry 12 Crystal Palace 13 Derby 14 Everton 15 Fulham 16 Hull City 17 Ipswich 18 Leeds 19 Leicester 20 Liverpool 21 Luton Town 22 Manchester City 23 Manchester United 24 Middlesbrough 25 Millwall 26 Newcastle 27 Norwich 28 Nottingham Forest 29 Oxford United 30 Plymouth 31 Portsmouth 32 Preston 33 QPR 34 Sheffield United 35 Sheffield Wednesday 36 Southampton 37 Stoke City 38 Sunderland 39 Swansea 40 Tottenham 41 Watford 42 West Brom 43 West Ham 44 Wolves 45 Salford City 46 Charlton 47 Exeter 48 Leyton Orient 49 Bristol Rovers 50 Dagenham &amp; Redbridge 51 Accrington Stanley 52 Lincoln City 53 Tamworth 54 Birmingham 55 Mansfield 56 Peterborough 57 Stockport 58 Wycombe 59 Morecambe 60 Bromley 61 Doncaster 62 Reading 63 Harrogate 64 Wigan Is romance truly dead? This season\u2019s FA Cup might lead you think so. For starters, only two non-league sides have made it into the famous third round, an early sign that removing replays might cut the number of giantkilling runs. Fifth-tier side Tamworth did profit from a penalty shootout to eliminate Burton Albion, while Dagenham &amp; Redbridge \u2013 above their National League cohorts on goal difference \u2013 won at AFC Wimbledon to book their place. Also, with no live TV game tonight, the draw is not being held in a freshly renovated non-league clubhouse, or sparsely furnished League Two conference room. No, it\u2019s taking place at the home of the holders, Manchester United. They are one of several certified big boys dropping into the draw, eager to snuff out any final sparks of FA Cup fun. Still, the Cup still usually finds a way. The draw begins at 7pm-ish, GMT.",

The Israeli PM, Benjamin Netanyahu, promised there would be a strong response to Hezbollah\u2019s attack, and the Israeli military later said it had \u201cstruck Hezbollah terrorists, dozens of launchers, and terrorist infrastructure throughout Lebanon\u201d.

In a statement, the group said the attack on the watchtowers was an \u201cinitial warning defensive response\u201d against \u201crepeated violations\u201d by Israel of the ceasefire agreement. The resumption of tit-for-tat strikes in south Lebanon and north Israel has caused concern that fully-fledged fighting between Hezbollah and Israel could resume just five days after a ceasefire was announced. Residents of Lebanon braced themselves for Israel\u2019s response to Hezbollah\u2019s attack on Monday night, with a witness saying that people started leaving Dahiyeh, the southern suburbs of Beirut where Hezbollah enjoys strong support, shortly after Netanyahu vowed to retaliate. \u201cWe are tired, we can\u2019t handle any more of this.

A solid team for many seasons on defence and in goal, the Jets have now found their scoring touch, outscoring opponents 94 to 63. It\u2019s an exciting time to be a Jets fan, with seemingly few reasons not to watch each game day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/05/utah-is-embracing-its-news-nhl-team-but-is-the-frenzy-sustainable\">Utah is embracing its new NHL team. But is the frenzy sustainable?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet, the Jets are struggling to get sell-out home crowds. With room for 15,321 for an NHL game, the Jets were only averaging around 13,760 fans per game <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5914065/2024/11/12/nhl-attendance-tracking-red-wings-penguins-2024/\">in mid-November</a>, according to one tally. That\u2019s up from their average last season \u2013 13,490 \u2013 but still short of where the best team in the league might expect to be. But this has been the story in Winnipeg for years. Ever since the NHL returned from the Covid-19 pandemic-imposed break, the Jets can\u2019t fill seats, despite icing playoff-bound teams. It\u2019s been a marked departure from the prior nine seasons, each of which the Jets played to capacity or over-capacity home crowds. What changed for Winnipeg? In a weird way, nothing.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the questions I get asked most often when talking to people across Canada about the possible return of the NHL to Winnipeg. Could we support it by selling out the building every night and generating enough corporate support?\u201d Paul Friesen wrote for the Winnipeg Sun in April 2011, shortly before the Thrashers left Atlanta for Winnipeg to become the new Jets. \u201cShort-term, yeah, I believe we could,\u201d he wrote. But \u201clong-term support for the NHL here is another kettle of fish. Two keys to any NHL franchise are the sale of seats and suites.\u201d Friesen concluded that the corporate money would be there, but that ticket prices for regular fans would be too high.</p> <p>The opposite occurred. Upon their return, the Jets <a href=\"https://archive.ph/Xw7Ek\">prioritized</a> ticket sales to fans, including those who\u2019d held tickets for the Manitoba Moose, the AHL team that had moved into the Jets\u2019 old home arena. Thousands more joined <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/winnipeg-s-nhl-season-tickets-sold-out-1.999140\">an online ticket queue</a>. The team sold 13,500 season tickets in three minutes. \u201cMark Chipman and David Thomson may have signed the $170m cheque to bring the NHL back to Winnipeg, but the team\u2019s real owners are its fans,\u201d the Sun crowed. Indeed, when the paper polled readers that spring, the majority (65.3%) said they\u2019d got their season tickets in the online rush. Twenty percent had been Moose season ticket holders. Just 6.6% said their employer had been a Moose corporate sponsor.</p> <p>For nine years of sell-out hockey, the corporate money didn\u2019t seem to matter. But, over time prices steadily rose, for tickets and at the concessions, and the season ticket base dwindled. The Covid-19 pandemic made everything worse, as Winnipegers, like many others, were hit hard by inflation. Between the return of the NHL after the pandemic and last spring, the once 13,500-strong season-ticket base was down to just 9,500. Jets owner Mark Chipman told The Athletic in February, months after the team\u2019s ownership group, True North Sports and Entertainment (TNSE), had begun pushing business leaders in Winnipeg to promote season tickets, that those numbers were still not high enough. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be honest with you if I didn\u2019t say, \u2018We\u2019ve got to get back to 13,000,\u2019\u201d Chipman said. \u201cThis place we find ourselves in right now, it\u2019s not going to work over the long haul.\u201d It sounded like a threat.</p> <p>So far, the only place the Jets look like they\u2019re headed is to the playoffs. And the ticket sales are, apparently, improving. \u201cWe are seeing growing momentum in the business community with respect to season ticket memberships,\u201d Krista Sinaisky, a TNSE spokesperson, told the Guardian via email in November. The Jets \u201care not relying on just any one strategy\u201d to get the team back to 13,000 season ticket holders, Sinaisky wrote, adding that \u201cwe are focused on selling more tickets to the business community and are developing new ticket packages tailored to companies of all sizes\u201d \u2013 an initiative Sinaisky said that \u201cwill be launched in the coming weeks.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not over for the Jets \u2013 far from it. And, for the record, Bettman isn\u2019t worried. Shortly after Chipman\u2019s comments last winter, Bettman arrived in Winnipeg to woo the corporate types. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why people are now speculating that somehow we\u2019re not going to be here,\u201d Bettman <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/10320180/gary-bettman-winnipeg-jets-attendance/\">wondered aloud</a> in a news conference. \u201cWe\u2019re not operating under the sword of Damocles or on a razor\u2019s edge,\u201d he said. But he\u2019s wrong, there. Every NHL team, like most major sports franchises, struggles with a dual identity, existing simultaneously as both a soulless corporate entity fixated on profits, revenue, <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp#:~:text=EBITDA%2C%20short%20for%20earnings%20before,accepted%20accounting%20principles%20(GAAP).\">ebitda</a>, and debt \u2013 that is, the things that get you on CNBC \u2013 and as a much more human enterprise, embodying hope, joy, sadness, and community. You could argue the Jets, by virtue of their dedication to their fan support, represent a more human franchise than others. But because of that, the edge they ride is very real, and thinner than most.</p>",

Shortly after Chipman\u2019s comments last winter, Bettman arrived in Winnipeg to woo the corporate types. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why people are now speculating that somehow we\u2019re not going to be here,\u201d Bettman wondered aloud in a news conference. \u201cWe\u2019re not operating under the sword of Damocles or on a razor\u2019s edge,\u201d he said. But he\u2019s wrong, there. Every NHL team, like most major sports franchises, struggles with a dual identity, existing simultaneously as both a soulless corporate entity fixated on profits, revenue, ebitda, and debt \u2013 that is, the things that get you on CNBC \u2013 and as a much more human enterprise, embodying hope, joy, sadness, and community. You could argue the Jets, by virtue of their dedication to their fan support, represent a more human franchise than others. But because of that, the edge they ride is very real, and thinner than most.",

      "bodyText": "A failed Conservative plan to send people seeking asylum to Rwanda spent \u00a350m on flights that never took off, new figures disclose. The Home Office has also revealed that the scheme \u2013 which ran under Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak\u2019s administrations \u2013 spent \u00a3715m over two years on the plan \u2013 \u00a315m more than previously claimed. The disclosures were made as the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, faced criticism from MPs on Monday after the number of people crossing the Channel topped 20,000 since Keir Starmer was elected. Data shows that ministers authorised the payment of \u00a330m in 2023-24 to secure flights and trained escorts for detainees, prepare airfields and provide money to pay for police who helped to secure the airfield. A further \u00a320m was spent on flight-related costs up to June 2024. The Rwandan government has received payments of \u00a3290m after Johnson signed a deal with Paul Kagame\u2019s regime, the document showed. Another \u00a3280m was spent on \u201cother fixed costs\u201d such as the development of digital IT and data systems, legal costs and staff costs. The extra \u00a395m was spent on detention centres to hold people before they could be sent to Rwanda. Johnson\u2019s Rwanda plan was supposed to act as a deterrent after a rise in the number of small boat arrivals. The plan was to deport \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of new arrivals so they could apply for asylum there. \u201cIn the two years the partnership was in place, just four volunteers were sent to Rwanda at a cost of \u00a3700m,\u201d Cooper told MPs. \u201cThe result of that massive commitment of time and money was 84,000 [who] crossed the Channel from the day the deal was signed to the day it was scrapped. \u201cThis so-called deterrent did not result in a single deportation or stop a single boat crossing the Channel.\u201d It comes after Home Office figures showed 122 people made the journey on Sunday in two boats, which means 20,110 crossings have been recorded since Labour won the general election.

Now its tens of thousands of fighters have seized a major city, cut a strategic highway and forced the military of Bashar al-Assad into a hasty retreat across a swath of the country, opening a new phase in a 13-year civil war that many presumed was over. What is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham? This sudden turn of events is shocking but not entirely surprising, veteran observers say. \u201cEveryone watching Syria knows it has been a tinderbox under very great pressure both domestically and from regional powers for years. The war has been continuing in the background \u2026 The scale of the gains made by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) is surprising but not the offensive if you look at what the group has been saying and signalling,\u201d said Charlie Winter, a Syria expert and director of ExTrac, a UK-based risk intelligence platform. For about five years, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which means Movement for the Liberation of Greater Syria, has controlled the north-western Syrian province of Idlib, where it has set up what it calls the Syrian Salvation government to run schools, clinics and courts for an estimated 4 million people.

Just a smattering of applause could be heard as Liz stopped mid-sentence. Almost as if the audience was in shock. This was too mad even for a thinktank that promoted Donald Trump.

The Betfred HQ in Warrington was opened by Hoyle at the end of last month, 20 miles outside his Chorley constituency. In a statement at the time of the opening, Betfred said it was in Hoyle\u2019s capacity as president of the Rugby Football League, where the gambling company is a long-term partner. But the plaque installed at the company\u2019s HQ only references Hoyle\u2019s role as speaker of the Commons, a strictly non-partisan role. The House of Commons said Hoyle visited Betfred in his capacity as RFL president only \u2013 despite what the plaque states \u2013 and declined to comment further. Will Prochaska, a campaigner for gambling reform, said: \u201cLindsay Hoyle\u2019s decision to help wash the reputation of Betfred, who were fined \u00a33.25m last year for irresponsible behaviour, brings the role of speaker of the house into disrepute. \u201cThe plaque should be removed and he should apologise to parliament and to the millions of people harmed by gambling each year in Great Britain.\u201d Matt Zarb-Cousin, the director of Clean Up Gambling, said: \u201cBeing Commons speaker is a privilege that comes with a responsibility to being non-partisan in all aspects of the job. That means not favouring particular interests over others. \u201cIt is a huge error of judgment for the speaker to be seen to be endorsing a gambling operator, in particular Betfred given its track record of mistreating staff and customers.\u201d Earlier this year the Gambling Commission fined Betfred\u2019s owners \u00a33.25m after an investigation revealed social responsibility and anti-money-laundering failures. In 2019, the Guardian found the bookmaker had underpaid staff and apparently failed to tell them they might be owed money even after it discovered the widespread payment problem. It was also forced to pay out in 2021 after a high court case from a gambler when it refused to pay out his 2018 winnings because of a \u201cdefect\u201d in the game.

      "bodyText": "Olaf Scholz has met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an unannounced visit to Kyiv that was his first since the early months of full-scale war as he sought to reassure Ukraine of German support. The German chancellor announced a military aid package worth \u20ac650m (\u00a3540m) during the trip amid doubts over his Ukraine policy at home and uncertainty over the upcoming presidency of Donald Trump and what it may mean for the war in Ukraine. Speaking in Kyiv, Scholz reiterated that Russia should not be allowed to \u201cimpose a dictated peace on Ukraine\u201d in any negotiations, and said no decisions should be made without Ukraine present. He spoke of hopes for finding \u201ca fair, just and lasting peace\u201d. He said that Germany would \u201cremain the strongest supporter of Ukraine in Europe\u201d and promised speedy arms deliveries. Scholz arrived at Kyiv\u2019s central station early on Monday morning, smiling and clutching a large metal briefcase as he disembarked from the train. He and Zelenskyy made a joint visit to a hospital to meet wounded war veterans, and also met drone producers. The visit appeared designed to reassure Ukraine of German support, after Scholz faced criticism for a recent phone call he initiated with Vladimir Putin, and with much of Europe braced for the return of Trump, who has claimed he could end the war in 24 hours. Scholz also has one eye on his domestic political situation, where he faces a confidence vote in two weeks\u2019 time and is hoping for re-election in a February ballot called after his coalition government collapsed last month. He has been criticised both by politicians who want Germany to stop sending weapons to Ukraine and by those who want him to do more, including sending long-range Taurus missiles to Kyiv, which he has so far refused to do. \u201cWe are working to have more common ground on the Taurus issue,\u201d Zelenskyy said during joint remarks to the press ahead of talks, while saying Ukraine was grateful for all the other help Germany has provided. The war is high on the agenda in Germany and is expected to play a big role in the upcoming elections. It is also prominent in German people\u2019s minds, not least as they have been urged to think about their war-readiness, by building shelters or bunkers and storing provisions, amid advice from German intelligence that Russia could be capable of attacking the country within the next five years. Scholz has attempted to present himself as a \u201cchancellor of peace\u201d and denied at the weekend that he was \u201cinstrumentalising\u201d the Ukraine conflict for his own political gain. \u201cIt\u2019s a topic whether I talk about it or not,\u201d he told a meeting of his Social Democrats, and accused the opposition leader Friedrich Merz, who could be Germany\u2019s next chancellor, of in effect giving Russia an ultimatum that he warned could quickly lead to escalation.

Confirmation that I am 63% British and Irish, 17% Danish and otherwise \u201cbroadly north-western European\u201d. I felt a resounding ambivalence about the results, including some disappointment that I had not discovered a newfound heritage \u2013 a piece of information that would give my identity new dimension. I was also surprised to find out that some parts of my identity present in the family lore \u2013 a Czech heritage \u2013 was not actually present in my genes. Now, as the looming collapse of the company raises serious concerns about what will happen to the database of users\u2019 genomic information, I am struggling to reconcile the fact that I traded away my genetic privacy to find out that I am mostly British.</p> <p>Timothy Caulfield, a professor at University of Alberta who has studied motivations for undergoing genetic ancestry testing and how consumer respond to their results, said my reaction \u2013 one of ambivalence \u2013 is actually the most common.</p> <p>\u201cWe are told by pop culture that we are supposed to care \u2013 that your genes matter,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a lot of people get their results and find it very underwhelming.\u201d</p>    <p>In addition to finding my results inconsequential, I have always found the idea of genetic testing for ancestry to be fraught, and was hesitant to buy into the idea that my genetic origins have any bearing on who I am as a person. Caulfield, who <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-why-your-dna-test-wont-reveal-the-real-you/\">had his own ancestry tested</a> despite similar misgivings, is of the same mind. He asserts that race is \u201ca biological fiction\u201d, one that these companies promote, marketing the idea that our genes are relevant to how we view ourselves as individuals. This mindset, Caulfield says, is \u201cthe essence of racism\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOn one hand, I am enraged by it \u2013 I think it is an incredibly harmful trend, especially in this polarized world that we live in, where we\u2019re becoming more tribalistic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, I get it. People are looking for roots. They\u2019re looking for meaning. They\u2019re looking for a tribe to belong to. And I think the marketing plays into that idea.\u201d</p> <p>That marketing was wildly successful for the better part of two decades. 23andMe was co-founded in 2006 by Anne Wojcicki. By the time it went public in 2021, the company was worth $3.5bn, and its value reached a peak of $6bn shortly thereafter. Competitors like Ancestry.com and MyHeritage entered the sphere, and by 2024 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/aug/18/rise-in-dna-tests-used-to-claim-citizenship-of-other-countries-brexit-eu\">more than 40 million people</a> in the world had taken consumer genetic tests.</p> <p>The individual appeal of these tests varies widely, but many consumers expressed an explicit desire to understand personal origins that inform their identities, said Muriel Leuenberger, a postdoctoral researcher at University of Zurich whose work centers on philosophy of identity and genealogy.</p> <p>\u201cOne hope I see in people pursuing these tests is to develop a richer self-conception,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a thought that you get this information, and then suddenly things you did in the past or character traits that you have might fall into place and make sense in a different way that they haven\u2019t before.\u201d</p> <p>For many people, those tests can reframe a sense of identity, for better or worse. Many have shared stories about a genetic test disproving longstanding family lore \u2013 like a long-cited story of Native American roots being negated, for example. I had always heard my family was Czech \u2013 a heritage that did not show up in any percentage in my results. This identity was not part of my upbringing beyond passing references, so discovering it did not exist make a huge impact on me. However, similar discoveries can lead to existential crises for those who have closely associated with a certain identity, said Leuenberger.</p> <p>\u201cFor some, you have a whole cultural background with which you really identify, maybe it was even part of your upbringing, and suddenly you\u2019re kind of cut off from it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can lead people to question this connection and whether they have a right to it if it is not proven by a genetic test.\u201d</p> <p>Such desires for certain cultural connections differ substantially by country, noted Caulfield \u2013 whose research found that in places like Canada and the US, consumers take tests hoping for an \u201cexotic\u201d background that aligns with the cultural understanding of our countries as a genetic melting pot. Black Americans <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/08/04/1191914142/a-landmark-study-opens-a-new-possible-way-for-black-americans-to-trace-their-anc\">have used</a> genetic testing to trace a lineage violently fractured by the transatlantic slave trade, though some Black Americans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/24/dna-test-roots-black-woman-ancestry\">have expressed</a> concerns about privacy \u2013 as well as the ways in which DNA testing risks reifying racial stratification.<strong> </strong>In markets like China and Japan, he said, advertising campaigns instead seek to appeal to reaffirmation of ancestral purity.</p> <p>With the future of 23andMe in peril, the overarching question among previous customers now is what will happen to the data that has already been collected. Leuenberger noted that by entering DNA into a database, users sacrifice not only their own privacy but that of blood relatives. Because an individual\u2019s DNA is similar in structure to that of their relatives, information about others can be gleaned from one person\u2019s sample. This is especially pronounced with the rise of open-access DNA sites like GEDMatch, on which users <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/magazine/dna-test-crime-identification-genome.html\">can upload</a> genetic data that can be compared to other samples. A consumer genealogy test <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/dna-from-genealogy-site-used-to-catch-suspected-golden-state-killer-1.4637726\">contributed</a> to the identification of serial killer Joseph James DeAngelo.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is ethically tricky with genetic data is that it\u2019s not just about self-knowledge \u2013 it\u2019s also knowledge about all of your relatives,\u201d Leuenberger said. \u201cMorally speaking, it is not necessarily information that is yours to give \u2013 and this risk is exacerbated if this company goes down and the fate of the data becomes more perilous.\u201d</p> <p>In an attempt to minimize these risks, I requested that my account be deleted and the company send me a copy of my data. I received an email confirming my deletion request \u2013 with some caveats. While samples I consented to have stored would be discarded, if I had opted into having my data used for research, that information could not be withdrawn or undone. Luckily, I had not. 23andMe and its genotyping labs are required under the federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and California laboratory regulations to retain my genetic information, date of birth and sex. In other words, the company is required to retain some portions of the information I am asking it to delete. The company will also retain \u201climited information\u201d related to my deletion request.</p> <p>23andMe declined to respond to questions regarding the nature of genetic information it is required to retain. In a statement, spokesperson Katie Watson cited 23andMe\u2019s \u201cstrong customer privacy protections\u201d, including not sharing customer data with third parties without customer consent. Many privacy concerns center around what will happen to the data if 23andMe changes ownership or goes bankrupt. Regarding those concerns, Watson noted that the company\u2019s CEO, Wojcicki, has stated she intends to take the company private, and is not open to considering third party takeover proposals \u2013 thus maintaining the current privacy policy.</p> <p>\u201cWe are committed to protecting customer data and are consistently focused on maintaining the privacy of our customers,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThat will not change.\u201d</p> <p>As for my genetic data, I received a copy of my ancestry report \u2013 confirming my largely British heritage \u2013 and a 17MB text file containing my entire genome. While being able to receive such data is compulsory under many privacy laws, it raises the question of how useful reclaiming our data from tech companies really is, Caulfield said. Referencing a study <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article%3Fid=10.1371/journal.pone.0229044\">conducted</a> in 2020<strong>, </strong>he said consumers at a fundamental level feel they should have a right to their genomic information \u2013 even if they cannot understand the raw mass of millions of As, Cs, Ts and Gs.</p> <p>\u201cIt is important to people to have a right to this data dump with their whole genome, even though for virtually every human on the planet it is meaningless,\u201d Caulfield said.</p> <p>So what will I do with my newfound understanding of self and long list of genotype identifiers sitting on my computer desktop? Nothing. I have traveled little in Europe, and thus have yet to visit any of my disparate homelands. Perhaps if I make my way over to London in the near future, I will be overwhelmed with a sense of belonging, and all my angst over who owns my genomic information will all be worth it. But I am doubtful that the tradeoff resulted in anything but a resounding ambivalence and the sacrifice of my genetic self.</p>",

This mindset, Caulfield says, is \u201cthe essence of racism\u201d. \u201cOn one hand, I am enraged by it \u2013 I think it is an incredibly harmful trend, especially in this polarized world that we live in, where we\u2019re becoming more tribalistic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, I get it. People are looking for roots. They\u2019re looking for meaning. They\u2019re looking for a tribe to belong to. And I think the marketing plays into that idea.\u201d That marketing was wildly successful for the better part of two decades. 23andMe was co-founded in 2006 by Anne Wojcicki. By the time it went public in 2021, the company was worth $3.5bn, and its value reached a peak of $6bn shortly thereafter. Competitors like Ancestry.com and MyHeritage entered the sphere, and by 2024 more than 40 million people in the world had taken consumer genetic tests. The individual appeal of these tests varies widely, but many consumers expressed an explicit desire to understand personal origins that inform their identities, said Muriel Leuenberger, a postdoctoral researcher at University of Zurich whose work centers on philosophy of identity and genealogy. \u201cOne hope I see in people pursuing these tests is to develop a richer self-conception,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a thought that you get this information, and then suddenly things you did in the past or character traits that you have might fall into place and make sense in a different way that they haven\u2019t before.\u201d For many people, those tests can reframe a sense of identity, for better or worse. Many have shared stories about a genetic test disproving longstanding family lore \u2013 like a long-cited story of Native American roots being negated, for example. I had always heard my family was Czech \u2013 a heritage that did not show up in any percentage in my results. This identity was not part of my upbringing beyond passing references, so discovering it did not exist make a huge impact on me. However, similar discoveries can lead to existential crises for those who have closely associated with a certain identity, said Leuenberger. \u201cFor some, you have a whole cultural background with which you really identify, maybe it was even part of your upbringing, and suddenly you\u2019re kind of cut off from it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can lead people to question this connection and whether they have a right to it if it is not proven by a genetic test.\u201d Such desires for certain cultural connections differ substantially by country, noted Caulfield \u2013 whose research found that in places like Canada and the US, consumers take tests hoping for an \u201cexotic\u201d background that aligns with the cultural understanding of our countries as a genetic melting pot. Black Americans have used genetic testing to trace a lineage violently fractured by the transatlantic slave trade, though some Black Americans have expressed concerns about privacy \u2013 as well as the ways in which DNA testing risks reifying racial stratification. In markets like China and Japan, he said, advertising campaigns instead seek to appeal to reaffirmation of ancestral purity. With the future of 23andMe in peril, the overarching question among previous customers now is what will happen to the data that has already been collected. Leuenberger noted that by entering DNA into a database, users sacrifice not only their own privacy but that of blood relatives. Because an individual\u2019s DNA is similar in structure to that of their relatives, information about others can be gleaned from one person\u2019s sample. This is especially pronounced with the rise of open-access DNA sites like GEDMatch, on which users can upload genetic data that can be compared to other samples. A consumer genealogy test contributed to the identification of serial killer Joseph James DeAngelo. \u201cWhat is ethically tricky with genetic data is that it\u2019s not just about self-knowledge \u2013 it\u2019s also knowledge about all of your relatives,\u201d Leuenberger said. \u201cMorally speaking, it is not necessarily information that is yours to give \u2013 and this risk is exacerbated if this company goes down and the fate of the data becomes more perilous.\u201d In an attempt to minimize these risks, I requested that my account be deleted and the company send me a copy of my data. I received an email confirming my deletion request \u2013 with some caveats. While samples I consented to have stored would be discarded, if I had opted into having my data used for research, that information could not be withdrawn or undone. Luckily, I had not. 23andMe and its genotyping labs are required under the federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and California laboratory regulations to retain my genetic information, date of birth and sex. In other words, the company is required to retain some portions of the information I am asking it to delete. The company will also retain \u201climited information\u201d related to my deletion request. 23andMe declined to respond to questions regarding the nature of genetic information it is required to retain. In a statement, spokesperson Katie Watson cited 23andMe\u2019s \u201cstrong customer privacy protections\u201d, including not sharing customer data with third parties without customer consent. Many privacy concerns center around what will happen to the data if 23andMe changes ownership or goes bankrupt. Regarding those concerns, Watson noted that the company\u2019s CEO, Wojcicki, has stated she intends to take the company private, and is not open to considering third party takeover proposals \u2013 thus maintaining the current privacy policy. \u201cWe are committed to protecting customer data and are consistently focused on maintaining the privacy of our customers,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThat will not change.\u201d As for my genetic data, I received a copy of my ancestry report \u2013 confirming my largely British heritage \u2013 and a 17MB text file containing my entire genome. While being able to receive such data is compulsory under many privacy laws, it raises the question of how useful reclaiming our data from tech companies really is, Caulfield said. Referencing a study conducted in 2020, he said consumers at a fundamental level feel they should have a right to their genomic information \u2013 even if they cannot understand the raw mass of millions of As, Cs, Ts and Gs. \u201cIt is important to people to have a right to this data dump with their whole genome, even though for virtually every human on the planet it is meaningless,\u201d Caulfield said. So what will I do with my newfound understanding of self and long list of genotype identifiers sitting on my computer desktop? Nothing. I have traveled little in Europe, and thus have yet to visit any of my disparate homelands. Perhaps if I make my way over to London in the near future, I will be overwhelmed with a sense of belonging, and all my angst over who owns my genomic information will all be worth it. But I am doubtful that the tradeoff resulted in anything but a resounding ambivalence and the sacrifice of my genetic self.",

She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the two years the partnership was in place, just four volunteers were sent to Rwanda at a cost of \u00a3700m pounds.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Home Office has now published <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medp-with-rwanda-and-the-illegal-migration-act-associated-costs/breakdown-of-home-office-costs-associated-with-the-medp-with-rwanda-and-the-illegal-migration-act-2023\">the costings document</a>, which gives new details of some of the costs incurred with the scheme. Here is a table setting out why the scheme cost \u00a3700m. It covers costs relating to the Migration and Economic Development Partnership (MEDP), the deal with Rwanda, and and costs relating to the Illegal Migration Act (IMA), the legislation that would have allowed the UK to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda without considering their claims.</p>    <p>The document also said that, under the deal with Rwanda, the UK would have paid the Rwandan \u00a3150,000 over five years for every single asylum seeker they accepted. This money would have covered living costs and asylum processing costs. Payments would have stopped if an asylum seeker left Rwanda early, but even then there would have been a one-off payment of \u00a310,000. The document explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Payments to cover asylum processing and operational costs for individuals relocated to Rwanda</strong>. The Home Office agreed to pay a five-year integration package for each relocated person, which covers accommodation, essential items such as food, medical services, education and other integration programmes. These payments can potentially last for five years and total \u00a3150,874 per individual, with the total annual payment decreasing over the five-year period:</p> <p>-Year 1: \u00a345,262 (this includes \u00a311,000 for the asylum assessment)</p> <p>-Year 2: \u00a337,718</p> <p>-Year 3: \u00a330,175</p> <p>-Year 4: \u00a322,632</p> <p>-Year 5: \u00a315,087</p> <p>Under the agreement, if a relocated individual decided to leave Rwanda, the UK would stop payments for that individual but would pay the Government of Rwanda a one-off \u00a310,000 per individual to help facilitate their voluntary departure. </p> </blockquote> <p>These payments would have been in addition to other lump sum payments made under the scheme. The UK has already paid \u00a3290m to Rwanda under this hearing, but future payments have been stopped. The document explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Payments to the Economic Transformation and Integration Fund (ETIF), which were designed to support economic growth in Rwanda</strong>. These are fixed cash payments and were due while the agreement was in force. A further \u00a3100 million of ETIF payments would have been due under the Treaty, \u00a350 million in each of the next two financial years 2025 to 2026 and 2026 to 2027. In addition, the Home Office was liable to pay \u2018volume trigger\u2019 ETIF payment of \u00a3120 million upon the transfer of 300 people to Rwanda. A per person ETIF payment would also have been made at \u00a320,000 per person.</p> </blockquote> <p>The reference to a per person ETIF pyament in that final sentence means Rwanda would have been getting \u00a3170,000 per individual over five years, in addition to the big lump sum payments.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-674de5dd8f0896f7344b337f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-12-02T16:59:51.582Z\">4.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cooper says Labour was left 'shameful' legacy on immigration by Tories</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Yvette Cooper</strong>, the home secretary, started her statment to MPs with a summary of the legacy she inherited.

And in just a few short years, an entire criminal smuggling industry built around boat crossings has been allowed to take hold along the UK border.</p> <p>The cost of the asylum system has also quardruped to \u00a34bn. In 2019 there were no asylum hotels. Five years on, there are more than 200.</p> <p>Returns of those with no right to be here are 30% below [the figures in] 2010.

Keir Starmer is giving a speech on Thursday and you can tell it is important because No 10 started briefing on what it is going to say in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/next-phase-of-mission-led-government-will-put-working-peoples-priorities-first-with-pm-set-to-unveil-plan-for-change\">a news release</a> to journalists sent out last Friday. He is going to announce a \u201cplan for change\u201d that will include \u201cmeasurable milestones\u201d. In the advance briefing <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> said it would be \u201cthe most ambitious yet honest programme for government in a generation\u201d.</p> <p>But hang on \u2013 hasn\u2019t Starmer announced plenty of \u201cmeasurable milestones\u201d already? In 2023 he announced <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/change/mission-driven-government/\">five missions</a>, which he said were not just conventional performance targets but part of an attempt to make government more strategic and focused on the long term. The five headline missions all included sub-missions, so arguably there were around 26 targets or pledges in the document. Then, as the election approached, Labour simplified matter by announcing <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/updates/stories/labours-first-steps-for-change/\">six first steps for change</a>.</p> <p>The new milestones will build on what the missions set out. No one is saying the five missions have been junked. But, by announcing new priorities, it is hard to avoid the conclusions that the old ones are being at best downgraded, and so it is not surprising that this is being seen as a relaunch. Politico this morning is describing it sarcastically as <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/london-playbook/pardon-the-interruption/\">the \u201cdefinitely-not-a-reset speech\u201d.</a></p> <p>In an interview yesterday <strong>Pat McFadden</strong>, the Cabinet Office minister, revealed that one of the new milestones will be to increase the number of children who are deemed educationally and socially ready when they start primary school from 60%, the current figure, to 75%. It is being reported that another milestone will be for the NHS to reach its target of getting the number of patients who get their operation within 18 weeks up to at least 92% \u2013 a goal that has not been reached for years.</p> <p>But today, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/operations-target-will-turn-a-and-es-into-war-zones-say-nhs-bosses-cq9fvn90g\">in their Times splash</a>, <strong>Chris Smyth</strong> and <strong>Oliver Wright</strong> say NHS leaders are concerned about the impact of prioritising cutting waiting lists above all else. They say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Health bosses accept the need to focus on the government\u2019s political priority but say ministers will need to accept trade-offs to achieve it. \u201cIf the priority is putting all the money into electives, what we will see is warzone A&amp;E departments and all sorts of other things being sidelined,\u201d said an NHS source. \u201cIt will have a number of casualties, including mental health, community care and waits in A&amp;E.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jacksurfleet/status/1863345132386267235\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Monday&#39;s TIMES: Labour NHS target &#39;will make A&amp;E waits worse&#39;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TomorrowsPapersToday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TomorrowsPapersToday</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/dlm5hUmFR1\">pic.twitter.com/dlm5hUmFR1</a></p>&mdash; Jack Surfleet (@jacksurfleet) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jacksurfleet/status/1863345132386267235?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 1, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>The pre-election missions also included plans to build 1.5m new homes \u2013 a target reaffirmed by the housing minister<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/20/farming-inheritance-tax-keir-starmer-angela-rayner-uk-politics-live?page=with:block-673db6028f082515be94ec76#block-673db6028f082515be94ec76\"> only last month</a>. In July <strong>Angela Rayner</strong>, the deputy PM and housing secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/jul/30/rachel-reeves-uk-economy-labour-tories-jeremy-hunt-uk-politics?page=with:block-66a8f6d48f0891104a9d921e#block-66a8f6d48f0891104a9d921e\">announced new housing targets</a> for local authorities in England designed to ensure this target is reached.</p> <p>But this pledge is also looking problematic. The BBC has published the results of an investigation showing that many councils, including Labour-run authorities, believe the new Rayner targets are unrealistic. In <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crk4y05vp61o\">their report</a> <strong>Alex Forsyth, Jack Fenwick </strong>and <strong>Hannah Capella</strong> explain:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Local councils have told the government its flagship plan to build 1.5m new homes in England over the next five years is \u201cunrealistic\u201d and \u201cimpossible to achieve\u201d, the BBC can reveal.</p> <p>The vast majority of councils expressed concern about the plan in a consultation exercise carried out by Angela Rayner\u2019s housing department earlier this year.</p> <p>The responses, obtained by the BBC through Freedom of Information laws, potentially set local authorities on a collision course with Labour over one of its top priorities.</p> </blockquote> <p>The report quotes many examples of what councils have said in response to the consulation.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Labour-run Broxtowe council in Nottinghamshire described the proposed changes as \u201cvery challenging, if not impossible to achieve\u201d.</p> <p>South Tyneside, another Labour-run council, said the plans were \u201cwholly unrealistic\u201d, while the independent-run council in Central Bedfordshire, said the area would be left \u201cabsolutely swamped with growth that the infrastructure just can not support\u201d.</p> </blockquote> <p>We will be hearing from Rayner later in the Commons, where she is due to take questions at 2.30pm.</p> <p>Yesterday <strong>McFadden</strong> said migration, which was not included in the original five missions, will be in the plan for change document. That topic is coming up later today too because Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, is giving a statement on irregular migration in the Commons after 3.30pm.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>11.30am:</em> Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.</p> <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Angela Rayner, the deputy PM and housing secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> <p><em>After 3.30pm:</em> Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, makes a statement to MPs about irregular migration, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/28/uk-deal-iraq-people-smugglers-europe\">the government\u2019s deal with Iraq covering people smuggling.</a></p> <p>If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line or message me on social media.

      "bodyText": "Keir Starmer has said he wants to see \u201cthe complete rewiring of the British state to deliver bold and ambitious long-term reform\u201d \u2013 while announcing that Sir Chris Wormald, seen as one of the more conventional shortlisted candidates, will be the next cabinet secretary. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, has published new details of why the last government\u2019s Rwanda deportation policy cost \u00a3715m \u2013 even though only four people ever ended up going there, as volunteers. (See 5.35pm.) Downing Street has played down claims that Keir Starmer\u2019s ambitious targets to cut waiting lists for routine operations, due to be announced in a major \u2018plan for change\u2019 speech on Thursday, could lead to other parts of the NHS losing out. (See 1.06pm.) Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, has repeated his claim that Donald Trump\u2019s team are \u201cappalled\u201d by the British government\u2019s deal transferring sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. He also claimed that over time the deal would fall apart, just as the Sino-British Joint Declaration supposedly guaranteeing Hong Kong certain rights for 50 years after the 1997 handover has been abandoned. (See 4.23pm.) Ministers are to postpone a full shift to eVisas next month after concerns that UK residents could be stranded abroad because of glitches in the system, the Guardian has learned. Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, urged Yvette Cooper to revive the Rwanda policy. Responding to her Commons statement, he said: Behind all the bluster and all the chat about previous governments, we see her record and her government\u2019s record. A 64% increase in small boat crossings since the same period before the election, 6,000 extra people in hotels, the asylum backlog up by 11,000, all since the 4th of July. We see the Rwanda deterrent, which the National Crime Agency and even Ursula von der Leyen says is necessary, cancelled by this government before it even started, so I call on her to think again on those issues. But Cooper, the home secretary, said that Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, won\u2019t commit to bringing back the policy because she knows it\u2019s flawed. Cooper said: So much do they know that this was a total failure, that their leader, their newly elected leader, won\u2019t even promise to reinstate it. Because she knows the whole thing was a con. The Covid 19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group, which represents the relatives of people who died during the pandemic, has condemned the appointment of Chris Wormald as the new cabinet secretary. In its statement it said: It is unbelievably frustrating and worrisome to see the government appoint Sir Christopher Wormald to the most senior civil service position in the UK, given his role at the head of the Department for Health and Social Care at a time when the NHS became completely overwhelmed, healthcare workers were sent to work without adequate PPE and lied to about it, and the UK suffered the 2nd highest death toll in Western Europe. Time and again Christopher Wormald has refused in the UK Covid inquiry to accept failures on behalf of the Department of Health and Social Care, despite irrefutable evidence to the contrary, backed up by the experiences of everyone in the UK during the pandemic. Christopher Wormald failed to prepare the Department for Health and Social Care for the pandemic, despite a pandemic being entirely foreseeable. Now he has been given responsibility for the crisis preparedness across the government. Either those in charge don\u2019t take the failures during the pandemic seriously enough, or they fail to see the importance of preparedness and resilience ahead of the next crisis. At the Covid inquiry last week counsel for the group, Allison Munroe KC, said Wormald\u2019s evidence to the inquiry was \u201can object lesson in obfuscation\u201d. (See 2.37pm.) In her statement to MPs Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, said she is today publishing details of the \u00a3700m spent by the last government on the Rwanda deportation scheme. She said: In the two years the partnership was in place, just four volunteers were sent to Rwanda at a cost of \u00a3700m pounds. The Home Office has now published the costings document, which gives new details of some of the costs incurred with the scheme. Here is a table setting out why the scheme cost \u00a3700m. It covers costs relating to the Migration and Economic Development Partnership (MEDP), the deal with Rwanda, and and costs relating to the Illegal Migration Act (IMA), the legislation that would have allowed the UK to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda without considering their claims. The document also said that, under the deal with Rwanda, the UK would have paid the Rwandan \u00a3150,000 over five years for every single asylum seeker they accepted. This money would have covered living costs and asylum processing costs. Payments would have stopped if an asylum seeker left Rwanda early, but even then there would have been a one-off payment of \u00a310,000. The document explains: Payments to cover asylum processing and operational costs for individuals relocated to Rwanda. The Home Office agreed to pay a five-year integration package for each relocated person, which covers accommodation, essential items such as food, medical services, education and other integration programmes. These payments can potentially last for five years and total \u00a3150,874 per individual, with the total annual payment decreasing over the five-year period: -Year 1: \u00a345,262 (this includes \u00a311,000 for the asylum assessment) -Year 2: \u00a337,718 -Year 3: \u00a330,175 -Year 4: \u00a322,632 -Year 5: \u00a315,087 Under the agreement, if a relocated individual decided to leave Rwanda, the UK would stop payments for that individual but would pay the Government of Rwanda a one-off \u00a310,000 per individual to help facilitate their voluntary departure. These payments would have been in addition to other lump sum payments made under the scheme. The UK has already paid \u00a3290m to Rwanda under this hearing, but future payments have been stopped. The document explains: Payments to the Economic Transformation and Integration Fund (ETIF), which were designed to support economic growth in Rwanda. These are fixed cash payments and were due while the agreement was in force. A further \u00a3100 million of ETIF payments would have been due under the Treaty, \u00a350 million in each of the next two financial years 2025 to 2026 and 2026 to 2027. In addition, the Home Office was liable to pay \u2018volume trigger\u2019 ETIF payment of \u00a3120 million upon the transfer of 300 people to Rwanda. A per person ETIF payment would also have been made at \u00a320,000 per person. The reference to a per person ETIF pyament in that final sentence means Rwanda would have been getting \u00a3170,000 per individual over five years, in addition to the big lump sum payments. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, started her statment to MPs with a summary of the legacy she inherited. It was \u201cshameful\u201d, she said. Over the last five years, controls in the immigration and asylum systems crumbled, legal and illegal migration both substantially increased, the backlog from the asylum system soared and enforcement of basic rules fell apart. Net migration quardrupled in just four years to a record high of nearly a million people, and it is still more than three times higher than in 2019. Dangerous small boat crossings rose from 300 people in 2018 to an average of total 36,000 a year in the last three years, a 120-fold increase. And in just a few short years, an entire criminal smuggling industry built around boat crossings has been allowed to take hold along the UK border. The cost of the asylum system has also quardruped to \u00a34bn. In 2019 there were no asylum hotels. Five years on, there are more than 200. Returns of those with no right to be here are 30% below [the figures in] 2010. Asylum-related returns are down by 20% compared to 14 years ago. That is the legacy that we inherited from the previous government, one that former ministers have themselves admitted to be shameful. In the Commons Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, is making a statement about immigration. It follows the publication of new net migration figures last week, and the announcement of a deal with Iraq designed to reduce irregular migration from that country. Tim Leunig, an economist and an adviser to the last government in various roles, has posted this on Bluesky about the new cabinet secretary, Chris Wormald. Delighted that Chris Wormald has been appointed as Cabinet Secretary. Clever, committed, strategic, principled and with a good understanding of politicians. Back in the Commons, Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader and Donald Trump ally, has renewed his claim that the Trump team are strongly opposed to the UK\u2019s decision to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. Speaking during the Commons urgent question on the topic, he said: I have been contacted by very senior officials and advisers from the incoming Republican administration, and every single one of them is appalled at this deal. They know the leasehold agreement [under which the UK would retain effective control of Diego Garcia, the main island on the Chagos Islands, housing the UK-US airbase, for at least 99 years] will not survive, just as the deal with China over Hong Kong did not survive. Hasn\u2019t the time come the government to admit this is a rotten deal for the UK, a rotten deal for America and an even worse deal for the Chagossians. And if you care so much about the sovereignty of the Falklands being in the hands of the Falkland Islanders, why not have a referendum of the Chagossians and ask them to settle who should have sovereignty over those islands? In response, Luke Pollard, the defence minister, accused Farage of \u201cwhipping up uncertainty\u201d about the future of the Falkland Islands. And he said that when Americans examined the detal of the deal, they would see it secured the future of the Diego Garcia base. Chris Wormald was permanent secretary at the Deparment for Education before he moved to the Department of Health and Social Care. Luke Tryl, the More in Common UK director, worked with him at the DfE and he thinks Wormald will be a good cabinet secretary. Sam Freedman, the Prospect columnist and Comment is Freed Substack commentator, also worked as an official at the DfE when Wormald was there. He has posted his take on the new cabinet secretary on Bluesky. Cartlidge is responding to the opening statement. He says the government is trying to finalise the deal before President Trump is in post. But Marco Rubio, who Trump wants to appoint as secretary of state, has said the deal poses a threat to US security, he says. Cartlidge says the new government in Mauritius also wants a review of the deal. He says trying to rush this deal through is \u201chugely disrespectful\u201d to the incoming Trump administration. Pollard repeats the point about all parts of the US governmment backing the deal. It would not have been possible to secure a deal and the support of the United States if all parts of the US security apparatus were not in support of this deal. In the Commons James Cartlidge, the shadow defence secretary, asks an urgent question about the impact of the transfer of sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius on UK-US defence relations. Luke Pollard, a defence minister, is responding. He says the deal is \u201cstrongly supported\u201d by the US, including all relevant departments and agencies. Downing Street has announced a mini-reshuffle to fill a gap created by the promotion of Heidi Alexander to transport secretary on Friday. Alexander was a justice minister before being appointed to replace Louise Haigh in cabinet following Haigh\u2019s resignation. Today Downing Street has announced that Sarah Sackman will replace Alexander as a minister of state in the Minstry of Justice, responsible for courts and legal services. Sackman was solicitor general. And the Labour MP Lucy Rigby joins the government as solicitor general. No 10 has also announced that Ellie Reeves, the Cabinet Office minister and Labour party chair, will start attending cabinet. Angela Rayner, the deputy PM and housing secretary, has dismissed claims that the government\u2019s plan to build 1.5m new homes over five years is unrealistic. She spoke during housing questions in the Commons after Paul Holmes, a shadow housing minister, asked her about a BBC report saying many councils have told the government they do not think its target can be achieved. Holmes said: In just five months we can see that this government\u2019s target of 1.5m new homes lies in tatters. The NHF (National Housing Federation) say the government will miss their target by 475,000 without more grant. The housing minister [Matthew Pennycook] last week said the same and now Labour-run South Tyneside council say the plans are \u2018wholly unrealistic\u2019 with other Labour councils agreeing. Isn\u2019t it time that the government admitted defeat, come back with a deliverable plan, and provide the sector with the certainty it needs to deliver more social homes across this country? And Rayner replied: [Holmes] has forgotten \u2013 his government failed to meet their housing targets every single time. This government is committed to building the 1.5m homes over this parliament. Under the Tories, housebuilding plummeted as they bowed to pressure from their backbenchers to scrap local housing targets. We\u2019re bringing back mandatory housing targets. The chancellor [Rachel Reeves] has put more money into the affordable homes programme and we will build those homes. He doesn\u2019t know my history and how I work. As Peter Walker writes in his story about the appointment of Chris Wormald as the new cabinet secretary, Wormald was \u201carguably the most traditional and low-key\u201d of the four candidates on the shortlist of the job. Olly Robbins, who oversaw Brexit negotiations under Theresa May before leaving the civil service, was seen as a possible favourite. Also in the frame were Antonia Romeo, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Justice, and Tamara Finkelstein, who holds the same role in the environment department. Peter also says Wormald\u2019s record on pandemic planning may not have helped his chances. Some evidence from the official inquiry into Covid has linked Wormald, who gave evidence to the inquiry in November last year, to what was seen as a wider prevailing complacency that the UK was well prepared for any pandemic. Pippa Crerar, the Guardian\u2019s political editor, says some people think Wormald is not the obvious choice for a PM wanting to rewire the British state. (See 1.37pm.) Some eyebrows raised over Starmer\u2019s appointment of Wormald, who has been a civil servant since 1991, to deliver the \u201ccomplete rewiring of the British state\u201d he says is needed to deliver ambitious long-term reform. (One counter-view is that a classic civil servant is better placed to do this, and take Whitehall with him, than an explosive character like Dominic Cummings.) Lord Bethell, who worked with Chris Wormald at the Department of Health and Social Care when he was a minister there in the last government, has posted this on social media praising the new cabinet secretary. When the killer zombies invade, I\u2019d like Chris Wormald at my back. A great civil servant and total mensch. Shrewd choice by Starmer. Chris Wormald was criticised only last week at the Covid inquiry. This is what Allison Munroe KC, counsel for Covid Bereaved Families for Justice UK, said about his evidence at an earlier hearing as she made her closing submission at the end of module 3 (the phase of the inquiry looking at the impact of Covid on the NHS). And then there was Sir Christopher Wormald. To be succinct, my Lady, those who listened to his evidence,and certainly our families, found it to be an object lesson in obfuscation, a word salad, so many, many words, so very little substance. What we saw in both [Matt] Hancock [health secretary during Covid] and Sir Christopher was institutional defensiveness at its highest form. Although sympathy was tendered on behalf of the bereaved by politicians with expressions of sorrow, humbly offered in hushed tones, that fell flat for our families listening and watching. Here is the clip. Dominic Cummings is not the only person unimpressed by Chris Wormald\u2019s handling of matters relating to Covid. John Crace has dug out the sketch he wrote when Wormald gave evidence to the Covid inquiry last year and John described his evidence as a \u201cmasterclass in time-wasting\u201d. It turns out John was prophetic. Imagine what it would be like working with Chris. A lifetime in the hell of a bureaucratic cul-de-sac. Where process trumps outcome every time. But he will get his reward. People pay good money for that kind of futility. Which is why he\u2019s tipped to be the next cabinet secretary when Simon Case steps down. Make that Lord Wormald. Dominic Cummings, who was Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser in Downing Street when the pandemic started, is scathing about Chris Wormald (as he is about almost everyone). He posted this on social media. Since I left No10 Ive explained how Westminster now is truly pathological, it seeks &amp; destroys the few things that work, like its persecution of special forces and closing of sewage monitoring necessary for bioterror etc. So it is a truly beautiful, artistic appointment to appoint as the most powerful official - a role 100X more powerful than ministers (other than the PM) - the official who told us all in Q1 2020 that we were \u2018the best prepared country in the world\u2019 for covid, who was responsible for the PM being told by then Cabinet Secretary on Thurs 12 March to go on TV to advocate for people holding \u2018CHICKENPOX PARTIES\u2019 so that as many as possible caught covid as fast as possible - the official who has presided over the implosion of the NHS and A&amp;E \u2026. Today should be a wake up call to all investors in UK and young talent - the Westminster system is totally determined to resist any change &amp; will continue all the things of the past 20 years that have driven us into crisis, the war of Whitehall on the productive and civilised forces in this country will continue to the knife. The Green party has responded to the BBC story saying many councils think the government\u2019s housing targets are unrealistic (see 9.26am) by saying it should prioritise getting council homes built. The Green MP Ellie Chowns said: Labour\u2019s housing strategy involves cosying up to big wealthy developers and falling for the myth that the private sector will build the housing that we need. But too many developers are more interested in lining their own pockets than in providing what communities are actually crying out for, which is affordable housing. We can\u2019t privatise our way out of the housing crisis. If we are to build the right homes in the right place and at the right price, we need to build hundreds of thousands of new council and social homes. These need to be in places well served by schools, health services and public transport. Not detached housing estates with a predominance of large expensive homes that make a quick and big buck for developers but are out of reach for most people. And here is the statement that Chris Wormald put out following his appointment as the next cabinet secretary. I am delighted that the prime minister has appointed me to the privileged role of leading our talented civil service, as we rise to the challenge of delivering the government\u2019s focused agenda to deliver its plan for change. The government has set a clear mandate \u2013 an ambitious agenda with working people at its heart. That will require each and every one of us to embrace the change agenda in how the British state operates. So I look forward to working with leaders across government, to ensure that the civil service has the skills they need to deliver across the breadth of the country. Wormald will start his new job a fortnight today, on 16 December. Chris Wormald, currently permanent secretary at the Department for Health and Social Care, will be the new cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, the government has announced. He will replace Simon Case, who became cabinet secretary when Boris Johnson was PM. Announcing the decision, Keir Starmer said: I want to thank Simon for his service to our country and for the invaluable support he has given to me personally during my first months as prime minister. He has been a remarkable public servant over many years, and our best wishes go to him and his family as he now takes time to focus on his health. I am delighted that Chris Wormald has agreed to become the next cabinet secretary. He brings a wealth of experience to this role at a critical moment in the work of change this new government has begun. To change this country, we must change the way government serves this country. That is what mission-led government will do. From breaking down silos across government to harnessing the incredible potential of technology and innovation, it will require nothing less than the complete rewiring of the British state to deliver bold and ambitious long-term reform. Delivering this scale of change will require exceptional civil service leadership. There could be no-one better placed to drive forward our plan for change than Chris, and I look forward to working with him as we fulfil the mandate of this new government, improving the lives of working people and strengthening our country with a decade of national renewal. Quite what Starmer means by \u201ccomplete rewiring of the British state\u201d is not clear. It sounds a bit like Dominic Cummings. Or like Kemi Badenoch, who has regularly spoken about her desire to rewire the system and who told the CBI last week \u201cone of the things that we\u2019re going to have to do is rewire everything\u201d. Downing Street has criticised the MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace for dismissing allegations about his sexually inappropriate behaviour as just the concerns of \u201ca handful of middle-class women of a certain age\u201d. Asked about the comment from Wallace, in an Instagram post at the weekend defending his conduct, the PM\u2019s spokesperson said: The culture secretary spoke with the BBC leadership at the end of last week on this matter and wider workplace culture issues to seek assurances that there are robust processes in place to deal with complaints. Clearly the comments we have seen from the individual over the weekend were completely inappropriate and misogynistic. More broadly the BBC is conducting an independent review into workplace culture which must deliver clear and timely recommendations. It\u2019s essential that staff and the wider public have confidence that the BBC takes these issues seriously. Wallace\u2019s laywers have denied that he engages in sexually harassing behaviour. There will be two urgent questions in the Commons this afternoon and two statements. They are: At 3.30pm: A defence minister responds to an urgent question from James Cartlidge, the shadow defence secretary, on \u201cthe impact of the government\u2019s Chagos negotiations on the UK-US defence relationship\u201d. Around 4.15pm: A Foreign Office minister reponds to a UQ from Labour\u2019s Barry Gardiner about attacks on the Hindu community in Bangladesh. Around 5pm: Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, gives a statement on net migration and border security. Around 6pm: Hamish Falconer, a Foreign Office minister, gives a statement on developments in north-west Syria. As Jessica Elgot reports, NHS leaders are reportedly worried that if Keir Starmer tells the health service to prioritise cutting hospital waiting lists, other aspects of healthcare will lose out. At the Downing Street lobby briefing, asked if it was realistic to set a goal of of getting the number of patients who get their operation within 18 weeks up to at least 92% (reportedly part of Stamer\u2019s \u201cplan for change\u201d), the PM\u2019s spokesperson replied: What you\u2019re seeing with all of these milestones is that they are going to be ambitious. There\u2019s no point in setting milestones that aren\u2019t ambitious. But do we think that they are achievable? When it comes to the NHS, as the Darzi report showed, we inherited an NHS that\u2019s broken, and the manifesto showed clearly that tackling waiting lists would be our immediate priority. The spokesperson said the milestones would be \u201cambitious but achievable\u201d. Asked specifically about claims that other parts of the NHS might lose out as a result of this being set as a target, the spokesperson replied: Tackling waiting lists is a critical step in taking pressures off A&amp;E and GP services. It\u2019s why it\u2019s been set out as one of the government\u2019s priority aims in office. That\u2019s not to say that the government isn\u2019t going to continue to take action on continue to take action on wider priorities in the NHS. I would point out we\u2019ve already resolved strikes, making this the first winter in years that all A&amp;E staff will be on the frontline rather than the picket line. The Downing Street lobby briefing has just finished. Asked about claims that the \u201cplan for change\u201d being unveiled by Keir Starmer on Thursday will suggest that achieving the highest sustained growth in the G7 is being downgraded as a target, the PM\u2019s spokesperson rejected this. He said: We\u2019re fully committed to all the missions. One of one of the missions is about the UK being the fastest growing economy in the G7 and it\u2019s important that it\u2019s the number one priority, because it\u2019s only through economic growth that we directly improve people\u2019s living standards. We\u2019ve been clear that the benefit of growth must be felt by working people. Milestones set out later in the week will set out how we\u2019re going to achieve that. I will post more from the briefing soon. Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, has said that he does not believe a story saying Elon Musk, the multi-billionaire Trump ally and owner of X, might give his party $100m. The suggestion was contained in a story published by the Sunday Times yesterday. It did not feature an on-the-record source for the claim, but it said \u201cleading businessmen and Conservative Party officials believe there is a credible prospect that Musk is preparing to give $100 million (\u00a378 million) to Farage as a \u201cf*** you Starmer payment\u201d with a view to transforming British politics\u201d. In an interview with GB News, Farage said that he did not know anything about this suggestion until he got a call about it from the Sunday Times on Saturday. He went on: I suspect this is not true. Legally, companies operating in the UK can give money to UK political parties, but I think we\u2019re a very long way away from that. Look, if it did happen, well, that\u2019d be great, but I think it\u2019s one of those really very good gossipy Sunday newspaper things. Let\u2019s see. But I rather doubt it. But Farage did say Musk was \u201cvery supportive\u201d of Reform UK. \u201cHe thinks that if Reform do well in the UK, we can bring about the same kind of change that he intends to do with Donald Trump in America,\u201d Farage said. In a blog on his Democracy for Sales Substack account Peter Geoghegan, the former editor-in-chief of openDemocracy and author of a book on the malign influence of money in politics, says this story illustrates why Britain\u2019s laws on political donations need to be tightened. He says: The craziest thing about this story is that it is all perfectly legal. Musk is a South African-born billionaire who lives in the US. Our election laws are explicitly supposed to prevent foreign donations like this - but anyone, from anywhere, can get around the rules if they donate through a UK registered company. (A wheeze Robert Jenrick knows well.) If Musk\u2019s donation does materialise it will likely be made via the British branch of X/Twitter, the Sunday Times reports. Trump\u2019s right-hand man can pump as much Reform content as he wants onto this social media platform. Britain\u2019s election laws, written for the analogue age, have barely changed since the digital revolution. Geoghegan says it is frustrating that Labour has done almost nothing to change the rules in this area, but he says tightening the law would not be difficult. Keir Starmer\u2019s \u201cplan for change\u201d being unveiled later this week (see 9.26am) will involve sidelining the mission pledge to deliver the highest sustained growth in the G7, Ben Riley-Smith from the Telegraph reports. New targets on living standards will be unveiled by Keir Starmer on Thursday Is being seen as a sidelining of his big economic pledge - getting the highest growth in the G7 Nerves about whether that\u2019s achievable. G7 target remains\u2026 but others now added The problem with the \u2018highest sustained growth in G7\u2019 target is Starmer of course doesn\u2019t control the economies of US, Aus, Canada, Germany, France, Japan US growing way faster now: 2.8% estimate for 2024 vs 1.1% for UK Plus the tax-raising Budget reduced medium-term forecasts For the new living standards target real household disposable income and GDP per capita have been considered. The new promise will likely have the benefit of not being a pledge to beat other countries. Labour will argue this is about making the benefits of growth be felt. Note the nuance. The G7 target remains. It will likely be mentioned in the \u2018Plan For Change\u2019 document unveiled on Thurs and Starmer\u2019s speech But a new major economic pledge will now be unveiled which in the coming years is likely to be talked about much more than the G7 ambition The Local Government Association says councils need multi-year funding arrangements to help them deal with dangerous cladding. In response to today\u2019s announcment from the government (see 10.08am and 10.17am), it issued this statement from Cllr Heather Kidd, chair of its safer and stronger communities board. Councils are committed to keeping tenants and residents safe, and are keen to work with government to drive the pace of remediation. However, for local government to carry out enforcement and addressing cladding issues as effectively and quickly as possible, multi-year funding arrangements are needed. Councils are keen to remediate the buildings they own that have dangerous cladding, but they need access to the necessary funding to do so on the same basis they had to remediate ACM [aluminium composite material] cladding. That is a reference to a scheme to fund the removal of ACM cladding first announced in 2018. Anneliese Dodds, the development minister, is attending a humanitarian conference in Cairo today where she is announcing \u00a319m in UK funding for Gaza, \u201cincluding \u00a312m in funding to the United Nations\u2019 Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and World Food Programme (WFP)\u201d. In a statement she said: The situation in Gaza is catastrophic. Gazans are in desperate need of food, and shelter with the onset of winter. The Cairo conference will be an opportunity to get leading voices in one room and put forward real-world solutions to the humanitarian crisis. The UK is committed to supporting the region\u2019s most vulnerable communities, pledging additional funding for UNRWA, and to supporting the Palestinian Authority reforms. Israel must immediately act to ensure unimpeded aid access to Gaza. I will meet counterparts both in Israel and the OPTs [occupied Palestinian territories] to discuss the need to remove these impediments, bring about a ceasefire, free the hostages and find a lasting solution to the conflict. Peter Apps, the leading housing journalist and author of a brilliant book on the Grenfell tragedy, isn\u2019t impressed with the new government targets for the removal of unsafe cladding from tall buildings. (See 10.08am and 10.17am.) He has explained why in posts on social media. Here are some of them. As a reminder, Labour promised in its manifesto to \u201creview how to better protect leaseholders from costs and take steps to accelerate the pace of remediation across the country, putting a renewed focus on ensuring those responsible for the crisis pay to put it right.\u201d Does this do that? Well... no, not really. The aim is to accelerate remediation, but how that will be achieved in practice is pretty uncertain. We have seen targets set and missed and set and missed since the whole thing started. It doesn\u2019t seem to work. Currently the stasis seems to be the result of disagreements about the level of remediation required, arguments about who is responsible, and a general squeeze in the (lengthy) supply chain for fixing buildings. More here: I can\u2019t really see how today\u2019s announcement is going to fix any of those. The fines for freeholders are clearly aimed at forcing them to get moving, but it isn\u2019t always the freeholder who is causing the delay. And sure, developers can promise to double the pace of building remediation, but how? Why? The 2029 end date for above 18m buildings is also not especially ambitious. Given the funding first came out in 2020, that\u2019s about where you\u2019d expect it to be without further intervention If you live in one of the affected buildings, I don\u2019t think life will feel particularly different after this announcement. The problems of non-qualifying leaseholders, non-cladding defects, orphan buildings, insurance costs, interim measures etc etc still stand Apps also says today\u2019s announcement is \u201cmiles and miles away\u201d from the approach to this problem Keir Starmer proposed in 2021 when he called for an independent taskforce on cladding to take direct control of dealing with the problem. Growth expectations among UK companies have taken \u201ca decisive turn for the worse\u201d, in a fresh blow to Rachel Reeves amid warnings that business confidence has plummeted since the budget. Julia Kollewe has the story. Building owners who fail to remove dangerous cladding could face jail, a minister warned today. Alex Norris, the building safety minister, issued the warning as he gave interviews this morning promoting the government\u2019s plan to ensure that all inflammable cladding on high-rise flats is removed by the end of 2029. (See 10.08am.) Speaking on Sky News, Norris said: I would want people who own buildings that are watching this, who have not been remediating them, to know we are on them, we are after them, and we want those buildings remediated. And if they don\u2019t, they will feel the force of the law. We have a range of powers already, ranging from fines to prison sentences, that can be used in health and safety cases. We will use that basket of tools in whatever way with each building to get it resolved. We have committed that that will be the case by the end of this decade. Dangerous cladding on all high-rise buildings in government-funded schemes in England will be fixed by the end of 2029, Angela Rayner has pledged. Haroon Siddique has the story. And here is the news release with details of the announcement from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. Here is Jessica Elgot\u2019s story about the NHS concerns about Labour prioritising cutting waiting lists. And here is an extract. No 10 insiders have said the new numerical targets, although risky, are a necessary recognition that Starmer\u2019s \u201cmissions\u201d which he set out in the run-up to the election were too conceptual for most people. The prime minister will cease rhetoric about achieving the highest growth in the G7 in favour of specific promises on a pledge to increase real disposable income. He will also recommit to a plan to build 1.5m affordable homes and to measurably improve school-readiness for nursery children. Good morning. Keir Starmer is giving a speech on Thursday and you can tell it is important because No 10 started briefing on what it is going to say in a news release to journalists sent out last Friday. He is going to announce a \u201cplan for change\u201d that will include \u201cmeasurable milestones\u201d. In the advance briefing Keir Starmer said it would be \u201cthe most ambitious yet honest programme for government in a generation\u201d. But hang on \u2013 hasn\u2019t Starmer announced plenty of \u201cmeasurable milestones\u201d already? In 2023 he announced five missions, which he said were not just conventional performance targets but part of an attempt to make government more strategic and focused on the long term. The five headline missions all included sub-missions, so arguably there were around 26 targets or pledges in the document. Then, as the election approached, Labour simplified matter by announcing six first steps for change. The new milestones will build on what the missions set out. No one is saying the five missions have been junked. But, by announcing new priorities, it is hard to avoid the conclusions that the old ones are being at best downgraded, and so it is not surprising that this is being seen as a relaunch. Politico this morning is describing it sarcastically as the \u201cdefinitely-not-a-reset speech\u201d. In an interview yesterday Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister, revealed that one of the new milestones will be to increase the number of children who are deemed educationally and socially ready when they start primary school from 60%, the current figure, to 75%. It is being reported that another milestone will be for the NHS to reach its target of getting the number of patients who get their operation within 18 weeks up to at least 92% \u2013 a goal that has not been reached for years. But today, in their Times splash, Chris Smyth and Oliver Wright say NHS leaders are concerned about the impact of prioritising cutting waiting lists above all else. They say: Health bosses accept the need to focus on the government\u2019s political priority but say ministers will need to accept trade-offs to achieve it. \u201cIf the priority is putting all the money into electives, what we will see is warzone A&amp;E departments and all sorts of other things being sidelined,\u201d said an NHS source. \u201cIt will have a number of casualties, including mental health, community care and waits in A&amp;E.\u201d The pre-election missions also included plans to build 1.5m new homes \u2013 a target reaffirmed by the housing minister only last month. In July Angela Rayner, the deputy PM and housing secretary, announced new housing targets for local authorities in England designed to ensure this target is reached. But this pledge is also looking problematic. The BBC has published the results of an investigation showing that many councils, including Labour-run authorities, believe the new Rayner targets are unrealistic. In their report Alex Forsyth, Jack Fenwick and Hannah Capella explain: Local councils have told the government its flagship plan to build 1.5m new homes in England over the next five years is \u201cunrealistic\u201d and \u201cimpossible to achieve\u201d, the BBC can reveal. The vast majority of councils expressed concern about the plan in a consultation exercise carried out by Angela Rayner\u2019s housing department earlier this year. The responses, obtained by the BBC through Freedom of Information laws, potentially set local authorities on a collision course with Labour over one of its top priorities. The report quotes many examples of what councils have said in response to the consulation. Labour-run Broxtowe council in Nottinghamshire described the proposed changes as \u201cvery challenging, if not impossible to achieve\u201d. South Tyneside, another Labour-run council, said the plans were \u201cwholly unrealistic\u201d, while the independent-run council in Central Bedfordshire, said the area would be left \u201cabsolutely swamped with growth that the infrastructure just can not support\u201d. We will be hearing from Rayner later in the Commons, where she is due to take questions at 2.30pm. Yesterday McFadden said migration, which was not included in the original five missions, will be in the plan for change document. That topic is coming up later today too because Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, is giving a statement on irregular migration in the Commons after 3.30pm. Here is the agenda for the day. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Angela Rayner, the deputy PM and housing secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 3.30pm: Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, makes a statement to MPs about irregular migration, and the government\u2019s deal with Iraq covering people smuggling.

      "bodyText": "The next UK general election could be a disaster of \u201cTrumpian proportions\u201d if the Labour government does not adopt measures to boost public trust in the political system, former ministers and campaigners have warned. A cap on political donations and wider powers for the House of Lords Appointments Commission to block unsuitable peer nominations are among 54 proposals laid out in a paper from the campaign group Unlock Democracy. Campaigners acknowledged that Keir Starmer has made changes to the ministerial code, including tightening the rules on gifts after a row over freebies. But they argued the prime minister was still able to ignore recommendations made by the independent adviser on ministerial interests \u201cwithout explanation\u201d while former ministers could continue to seek jobs outside government. The Unlock Democracy paper also recommends the introduction of a clear job description for MPs against which constituents and the standards commissioner would be able to measure their performance. The UK\u2019s \u201cover-reliance on conventions and norms\u201d is a source of democratic vulnerability, the paper argues. It urges the government to give the House of Lords Appointments Commission the power to block peerage nominations to address perceptions of cronyism. A substantial reduction in party campaign spending and a cap on political donations had also been recommended to reduce the ability of wealthy donors to \u201cwield outsized, unaccountable influence\u201d. Other recommendations suggested to reverse \u201cdemocratic backsliding\u201d include: Cabinet ministers must be confirmed by MPs\u2019 select committees and parliament should ratify new prime ministers before the new government can bring forward a king\u2019s speech. Close loopholes that allow unincorporated associations to conceal the source of their political donations or overseas residents to donate to political parties A \u00a3200 per-item limit on freebies for MPs or ministers and a cap on earnings from second jobs at half an MP\u2019s salary. Amend the MPs\u2019 code of conduct and the Recall of MPs Act 2015 so they can be punished for failing to fulfil their responsibilities. Tom Brake, director of Unlock Democracy and formerly a Liberal Democrat minister, said: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s return to the White House should set alarm bells ringing for all of us who value democracy.

Some evidence from the official inquiry into Covid has linked Wormald, who gave evidence in November last year, to what was seen as a wider prevailing complacency that the UK was well prepared for any pandemic, with a knock-on effect for NHS and care services. In evidence later that month, Patrick Vallance, who was the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser at the time, said he had been reprimanded by Wormald, as well as Mark Sedwill, then cabinet secretary, for calling for more urgent action to be taken against the virus in mid-March 2020. Vallance said Wormald had been \u201cincandescent\u201d with anger at his actions, because he had not raised the idea through more formal channels. Barbara Herbert from the Covid 19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group said it was \u201cunbelievably frustrating and worrisome\u201d to see Wormald promoted. \u201cTime and again, Christopher Wormald has refused in the UK Covid Inquiry to accept failures on behalf of the Department of Health and Social Care, despite irrefutable evidence to the contrary, backed up by the experiences of everyone in the UK during the pandemic,\u201d she said. He had, Herbert added, \u201cfailed to prepare the Department for Health and Social Care for the pandemic, despite a pandemic being entirely foreseeable\u201d. However, Sajid Javid, who was health secretary after the peak of the pandemic, called the appointment of Wormald \u201ca smart choice\u201d. He said: \u201cHaving worked closely with him during my time at Health and Social Care, I saw just how brilliant and dedicated he is. He\u2019s got a sharp mind, a deep understanding of how government works, and he delivers results, even in tough situations.\u201d Wormald also previously headed the Department for Education. He had stints in the Cabinet Office and the communities department, and as principal private secretary to Blair-era Labour ministers Estelle Morris and Charles Clarke. Case announced in September that he would step down on health grounds after four years in the job, after undergoing medical treatment for a neurological condition. He had also been linked to controversies over leaks and internal rows during the first months of the Starmer government. Announcing the decision, Starmer thanked Case \u201cfor his service to our country and for the invaluable support he has given to me personally during my first months as prime minister\u201d, adding: \u201cHe has been a remarkable public servant over many years, and our best wishes go to him and his family as he now takes time to focus on his health. \u201cI am delighted that Chris Wormald has agreed to become the next cabinet secretary. He brings a wealth of experience to this role at a critical moment in the work of change this new government has begun.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ministers are to postpone a full shift to eVisas next month after concerns that UK residents could be stranded abroad because of glitches in the system, the Guardian has learned. It follows complaints from applicants who have failed to gain access to the new digital immigration system so they can demonstrate they have a right to return to their homes in the UK. Most physical documentation proving the right to remain in the UK, such as biometric residence permits, will no longer be valid as proof of residency from 31 December. It is understood that hundreds of UK residents have struggled to access the system from abroad and so cannot return to their homes, Home Office insiders said. The Guardian disclosed on Sunday that migrant workers who have the right to live and work in the UK cannot access their eVisas and provide proof that they are allowed to be in the country. A Whitehall source said that ministers will postpone the full rollout on 1 January and have examined the possibility of changing the rules so that physical documentation could be allowed in certain circumstances. \u201cThese were problems that must have been obvious to ministers under the Tories. They had plenty of time to iron out these problems earlier in the process. It is more chaos that we have been left to sort out,\u201d the source said. The Home Office has been issuing eVisas for several years \u2013 including the EU settlement scheme (EUSS) after Brexit, skilled work visas, and Hongkongers applying for the British national (overseas) visa. Paper documents were supposed to be completely phased out and replaced from 1 January. The last government announced the plan for a full rollout of eVisas on 17 April. Tom Pursglove, the then Tory minister for legal migration, said it would \u201censure firm control over who comes here to live, work or study, strengthening border security and preventing abuse of the immigration system\u201d. It was suggested the introduction would reduce the risk of fraud, the loss and abuse of physical documents, and strengthen border security. Those who inspect immigration status were supposed to be able to conduct one check using an online service and visa holders would be able to access their digital status anywhere and in real time. But officials have told ministers that the scheme, which trawls dozens of disparate government databases to generate a new immigration status each time someone logs in, is error-prone. Foreign nationals on \u201cleave to remain\u201d have to renew their status every few years, and while they wait for a decision, they are put on \u201c3C leave\u201d. This is meant to protect the rights they have to work, study or claim benefits, but it leaves them without a physical document confirming their status \u2013 something many employers insist on seeing. Many who have applied for eVisas while waiting for their visas to be renewed have hit a wall when they make the application online.

      "body": "<p>The Bibi Files, a new documentary, begins with its eponymous antihero, Benjamin Netanyahu, being read his rights by police interrogators. His oblong, jowled face is well known \u2013 Netanyahu has been Israel\u2019s prime minister for a total of 17 years \u2013 but we are accustomed to seeing him in charge of events, behind a lectern haranguing his country and the world beyond. We have never seen him like this.</p> <p>Late last year, videos of police questioning of Netanyahu, his family, his rich backers and his disillusioned aides were leaked to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/alex-gibney\">Alex Gibney</a>, an Oscar-winning American documentary maker and one of the producers of <a href=\"https://www.jolt.film/watch/the-bibi-files\">The Bibi Files</a>. The tapes were recorded between 2016 and 2018 and appear for the first time in The Bibi Files, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/sep/10/the-bibi-files-netanyahu-documentary-toronto\">premiered at festivals in Toronto</a> and New York but still cannot be viewed in Israel.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>During the questioning, we see Netanyahu project derision, bewilderment, boredom \u2013 and anger</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From the outset, we see Netanyahu literally backed into a corner, behind his desk, fending off a barrage of questions about lavish gifts which the police claim he received in return for favours, and about political favours that they claim were bestowed in return for flattering news coverage.</p> <p>The leaked tapes themselves are compelling, but the director, Alexis Bloom, seeks to go further. The Bibi Files appears to draw a bright, bold, causal line between Netanyahu\u2019s 2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/21/israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-indicted-for-bribery-and\">corruption indictment</a> and the current state of the region. Netanyahu has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, alleging he is the victim of a politically motivated witch-hunt orchestrated by liberal media and a biased justice system, and he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/08/netanyahu-corruption-trial-resumes-weeks-before-israeli-election\">formally pleaded not guilty</a> in a trial which has now continued, off and on, since 2020. However, the film argues that the trial is part of the reason a desperate Netanyahu took his country and the surrounding region into the abyss. Netanyahu has said throughout the war that he is motivated by the need to reestablish Israel\u2019s security.</p>    <p>Raviv Drucker, an Israeli television journalist and co\u2013producer of The Bibi Files, has devoted much of his career to investigating allegations of corruption surrounding Netanyahu and his family. He says he always operated on the assumption that no one should be above the law, but now swears that, if he had known where Netanyahu would lead the country, he would rather the prime minister had never been indicted.</p> <p>\u201cIf you had taken me through some kind of time tunnel and shown me where we are in 2024, I would have told you: \u2018Just don\u2019t start with these cases.\u2019 I would throw all of them in the garbage, even though some of them started with my investigations,\u201d Drucker tells me during a work visit to Japan. \u201cThis is the honest truth, because none of us would have imagined what Netanyahu would do.\u201d</p> <p>In a series of tableaux, we see the embattled politician confront his accusers. A uniformed officer opens proceedings by warning that anything Netanyahu says may be used in a court of law, and the prime minister reaches for a bottle of mineral water, as if looking for something to do that will come across as nonchalant. In the questioning that follows, Netanyahu will seek to project derision, bewilderment, boredom and anger. Yet sometimes, when the police reveal some unexpected piece of evidence appearing to corroborate their allegations, it is possible to catch a glint of terror in his eyes.</p> <p>The setting for much of the drama is Netanyahu\u2019s surprisingly modest office: an average-sized desk, a big map of the Middle East at his back, a shredder and an unplugged mobile radiator beside him. The prime minister knows full well his interrogation sessions are being filmed and may one day become public, but The Bibi Files is surely an outcome beyond his worst imagining.</p> <p>Bloom, the director and co-producer, is a South African who has previously exposed some powerful and venal men. Her 2018 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/07/divide-and-conquer-roger-ailes-documentary-alexis-bloom\">Divide and Conquer</a> looks at the rise and fall of the former Fox News boss and Trump-booster Roger Ailes.</p> <p>Drucker, Netanyahu\u2019s nemesis for many years, plays the role of chorus in The Bibi Files, chronicling the prime minister\u2019s slide towards war and extremism. Netanyahu has tried to stop the film coming out with a series of injunctions aimed against Drucker, and his demeanour palpably tenses when the police drop the journalist\u2019s name in one of their sessions with him.</p>    <p>Netanyahu tried to shrug off Drucker, as he has largely ignored Israeli media as a whole in recent years, but he could not dodge the police when they asked the same questions. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty remarkable. It\u2019s tens of hours of the most powerful men and women in Israel in the most extraordinary situation, where they are fighting for their lives, and it\u2019s amazing to watch,\u201d the journalist says.</p> <p>We do not just see Netanyahu being quizzed, we also watch Israel\u2019s super-rich squirm in the face of questions about the lavish gifts police claim that they presented to the prime minister and his wife, Sara. In the film, giving various accounts from former aides, it appears that the couple were not shy about soliciting such gifts \u2013 though the Netanyahus deny demanding presents from rich friends. In the particular case of a gift of jewellery worth tens of thousands of dollars, Sara tells the police in the film: \u201cI did not personally ask for a ring and a necklace.\u201d Her husband said he had no knowledge of it.</p> <p>In return, it is alleged that favours were distributed, such as a US visa procured for a tycoon thanks to Netanyahu\u2019s direct intervention with the then secretary of state, John Kerry. In another case, it is claimed that a government document was drafted and signed for a mogul, giving him access to hundreds of millions dollars in short-term funds which saved him from bankruptcy.</p> <p>Netanyahu slaloms through the inquisition, dismissing some matters as trivial and private \u2013 simply gifts from close friends \u2013 his eyebrow raised at the impertinence of the questioner. Much of the time he claims simply not to remember.</p> <p>Only occasionally does he seem to lose his temper and bang his desk, but when he does it comes across as just another act in the overall performance. By contrast, Sara Netanyahu\u2019s rage seems genuine. She screams at the policemen that wherever her husband goes in the world, he is \u201ctreated like a king\u201d. (The film was made before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/21/icc-issues-arrest-warrant-for-benjamin-netanyahu-israel\">International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants</a> for Netanyahu for war crimes in Gaza. Israel is appealing the warrants and Netanyahu denies the allegations, but meanwhile the prime minister\u2019s travel options are limited.)</p>    <p>The couple\u2019s son, Yair, who we learn in The Bibi Files may be groomed as a successor, is even more unbridled in his contempt for his interrogators than his parents, comparing them to the Gestapo. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/17/netanyahus-son-banned-from-facebook-over-hate-speech\">inflammatory rhetoric he has spread online</a> embodies the end-point of his father\u2019s political journey from centre-right dealmaker to the head of the most extreme government in Israeli history. It includes previously fringe figures such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/18/israeli-minister-itamar-ben-gvir-visit-al-aqsa-mosque\">Itamar Ben-Gvir</a>, who has a past conviction for inciting racial hatred, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/24/israeli-far-right-minister-bezalel-smotrich-annex-west-bank\">Bezalel Smotrich</a>, a former political activist who was arrested in 2005 in possession of 700 litres of petrol allegedly intended for use in blowing up a motorway running through Tel Aviv \u2013 though he was released after three weeks without charge, and denied the allegation. They are now ministers for national security and finance respectively.</p> <p>Drucker argues that Netanyahu\u2019s sharp turn to the right has its origins in his corruption indictment. The prime minister stunned people by refusing to resign, and when the indictment narrowed the field of Israeli parties willing to form a coalition government with him he turned in 2022 to the only alternative that would keep him in power.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the only reason that he established the most far-right coalition that was ever established in the history of Israel,\u201d Drucker said. \u201cBen-Gvir and Smotrich are two lunatics from the far right. They represented a tiny fraction of the population.\u201d</p> <p>He argues Netanyahu\u2019s determination to avoid being tried led him to try to dilute the power of Israel\u2019s supreme court, which may one day sit in judgement over him, by abolishing the court\u2019s power to overrule government decisions. That attempt split the country and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/22/tens-of-thousands-of-israelis-march-as-vote-on-judicial-curbs-nears\">brought the biggest protests in Israeli history</a> on to the streets last year, though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/01/israel-supreme-court-strikes-down-netanyahus-judicial-overhaul-law\">the supreme court ultimately struck down the law</a> at the heart of this judicial overhaul project.</p> <p>Following the far-right agenda of his coalition partners, meanwhile, entailed focusing the military\u2019s effort in the West Bank in support of Israeli settlers, moving units and weaponry away from the south, where Hamas struck in October last year, killing 1,200 Israelis and taking 250 hostage. \u201cHamas of course has always wanted to destroy us. It\u2019s not because of Bibi,\u201d Drucker stresses. \u201cBut they recognised a great opportunity and they took advantage of it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/24/what-is-israel-judicial-overhaul-vote-about-what-happens-next\">What is Israel\u2019s judicial overhaul about and what happens next?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once the Gaza war had been started by Hamas, Netanyahu has had every reason to keep it going, even after almost every Hamas leader and military commander has been killed, among an estimated 44,000 Palestinians in total.</p> <p>His hard-right partners could tolerate a truce in Lebanon but would walk out of the coalition if there is a hostage deal with Hamas involving a prisoner exchange and a ceasefire. That would trigger new elections \u2013 which opinion polls suggest Netanyahu would lose. He would be stripped of the executive power he has been using to stay out of court and potentially out of jail.</p> <p>\u201cThat would be a disaster for him,\u201d Drucker said. \u201cHe will do everything he needs to keep on going with the war, and he will keep on going until there is a situation when it endangers his political survival. And then he will stop the war.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout the Gaza war, Netanyahu has insisted that it was Hamas who were the main obstacles to a ceasefire deal, but at the same time insisted that he prosecute the conflict until \u201ctotal victory\u201d, the complete destruction of Hamas.</p> <p>Even if Netanyahu ends up being convicted, Drucker doubts he will ever spend time in jail, but will rather keep his appeals going until his advancing age leads him to be spared from incarceration.</p> <p>But after all his years investigating Netanyahu, culminating in The Bibi Files, Drucker finds that he cares much less about the prime minister\u2019s ultimate fate than he used to. \u201cTwo years ago, it was the whole world for us: the rule of law, everybody being equal, even the prime minister,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now we are stuck in such a terrible mess in Israel. Our whole foundation is rocking every day beneath our feet. Now all we want is to live without the sirens and having to take our kids to air raid shelters.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The Bibi Files will be released in UK and Irish cinemas and on demand on 13 December. It will be on DocPlay in Australia on 12 December.</p>",

Much of the time he claims simply not to remember. Only occasionally does he seem to lose his temper and bang his desk, but when he does it comes across as just another act in the overall performance. By contrast, Sara Netanyahu\u2019s rage seems genuine. She screams at the policemen that wherever her husband goes in the world, he is \u201ctreated like a king\u201d. (The film was made before the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu for war crimes in Gaza. Israel is appealing the warrants and Netanyahu denies the allegations, but meanwhile the prime minister\u2019s travel options are limited.) The couple\u2019s son, Yair, who we learn in The Bibi Files may be groomed as a successor, is even more unbridled in his contempt for his interrogators than his parents, comparing them to the Gestapo. The inflammatory rhetoric he has spread online embodies the end-point of his father\u2019s political journey from centre-right dealmaker to the head of the most extreme government in Israeli history. It includes previously fringe figures such as Itamar Ben-Gvir, who has a past conviction for inciting racial hatred, and Bezalel Smotrich, a former political activist who was arrested in 2005 in possession of 700 litres of petrol allegedly intended for use in blowing up a motorway running through Tel Aviv \u2013 though he was released after three weeks without charge, and denied the allegation. They are now ministers for national security and finance respectively. Drucker argues that Netanyahu\u2019s sharp turn to the right has its origins in his corruption indictment. The prime minister stunned people by refusing to resign, and when the indictment narrowed the field of Israeli parties willing to form a coalition government with him he turned in 2022 to the only alternative that would keep him in power. \u201cThis is the only reason that he established the most far-right coalition that was ever established in the history of Israel,\u201d Drucker said. \u201cBen-Gvir and Smotrich are two lunatics from the far right. They represented a tiny fraction of the population.\u201d He argues Netanyahu\u2019s determination to avoid being tried led him to try to dilute the power of Israel\u2019s supreme court, which may one day sit in judgement over him, by abolishing the court\u2019s power to overrule government decisions. That attempt split the country and brought the biggest protests in Israeli history on to the streets last year, though the supreme court ultimately struck down the law at the heart of this judicial overhaul project. Following the far-right agenda of his coalition partners, meanwhile, entailed focusing the military\u2019s effort in the West Bank in support of Israeli settlers, moving units and weaponry away from the south, where Hamas struck in October last year, killing 1,200 Israelis and taking 250 hostage. \u201cHamas of course has always wanted to destroy us. It\u2019s not because of Bibi,\u201d Drucker stresses. \u201cBut they recognised a great opportunity and they took advantage of it.\u201d Once the Gaza war had been started by Hamas, Netanyahu has had every reason to keep it going, even after almost every Hamas leader and military commander has been killed, among an estimated 44,000 Palestinians in total. His hard-right partners could tolerate a truce in Lebanon but would walk out of the coalition if there is a hostage deal with Hamas involving a prisoner exchange and a ceasefire. That would trigger new elections \u2013 which opinion polls suggest Netanyahu would lose. He would be stripped of the executive power he has been using to stay out of court and potentially out of jail. \u201cThat would be a disaster for him,\u201d Drucker said. \u201cHe will do everything he needs to keep on going with the war, and he will keep on going until there is a situation when it endangers his political survival. And then he will stop the war.\u201d Throughout the Gaza war, Netanyahu has insisted that it was Hamas who were the main obstacles to a ceasefire deal, but at the same time insisted that he prosecute the conflict until \u201ctotal victory\u201d, the complete destruction of Hamas. Even if Netanyahu ends up being convicted, Drucker doubts he will ever spend time in jail, but will rather keep his appeals going until his advancing age leads him to be spared from incarceration. But after all his years investigating Netanyahu, culminating in The Bibi Files, Drucker finds that he cares much less about the prime minister\u2019s ultimate fate than he used to. \u201cTwo years ago, it was the whole world for us: the rule of law, everybody being equal, even the prime minister,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now we are stuck in such a terrible mess in Israel. Our whole foundation is rocking every day beneath our feet. Now all we want is to live without the sirens and having to take our kids to air raid shelters.\u201d \u2022 The Bibi Files will be released in UK and Irish cinemas and on demand on 13 December. It will be on DocPlay in Australia on 12 December.",

      "bodyText": "A retired police dog has rescued a vulnerable missing person in East Sussex on his first walk since having major surgery. The German shepherd, named Bear, found the man in dense undergrowth while being walked by his owner, Julia Pope, a former police officer. Pope said the dog, who was celebrating his 12th birthday on the day of the discovery in the Eastbourne area of East Sussex, immediately \u201cwent into work mode\u201d after sensing the lost individual and \u201cstarted indicating towards an area of dense undergrowth\u201d. \u201c[He] then dragged us to it, where he located and alerted us to a vulnerable man,\u201d Pope said. \u201cThe man was confused, wet, cold and had fallen over, and was unable to get up unaided. I\u2019m not sure he would have survived the night as it was extremely cold and almost dark at that point with no one else in the vicinity. \u201cUnbeknownst to us, the man was a vulnerable missing person who officers had been searching for without any success.\u201d Pope added that with Bear leading the way they helped the man back to an area where he could coordinate with local officers and be reunited with his family. She described last Thursday\u2019s rescue as an \u201camazing stroke of luck\u201d. Pope adopted the canine in 2020 after he retired from Sussex police. The German shepherd keeps busy in retirement by working as a wellbeing and trauma support dog for police staff. Last summer, Bear needed an emergency MRI and surgery to treat four herniated discs in his spine after he lost the use of his rear legs. He was supported by the Thin Blue Paw Foundation, a national charity that supports former police dogs. The dog had further surgery to remove two benign tumours two weeks before locating the vulnerable man on his first walk since the operation. Kieran Stanbridge, a Thin Blue Paw trustee, said: \u201cRPD Bear is a true hero \u2013 his training and instinct kicked in and he managed to lead his owners, who are former police officers themselves, to this vulnerable man who needed urgent help. \u201cThanks to Bear, the man received the help he needed from local officers; even in his retirement, he\u2019s still saving lives.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Barcelona left the party early, their birthday also belonging to those who travelled the furthest to be there. There was music, candles and a cake, a piano, five presidents and Pep Guardiola singing on the screen, or lip-syncing at least, but by the time the club\u2019s 125th-anniversary celebrations closed at the Liceu theatre on Friday night there were no first-team players. A little after half past nine, two hours into their grand gala on the Ramblas, a figure appeared in the shadow of the aisle and gestured to depart, 30 men in grey suits silently slipping out to prepare the final act, the crowning performance: in 14 hours they had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/30/european-football-roundup-las-palmas-barcelona-la-liga-seriea-ligue1\">a match to play</a>.</p> \n<p>There have been thousands of them since 1899 when Mr Kans Kamper [sic] put a 63-word classified in <em>Los Deportes</em> asking if anyone wanted to play <em>foot-vall</em> and 12 turned up. The day after the gala would be Barcelona\u2019s 3,034th in La Liga alone, and the league hadn\u2019t even started for another 40 years after their foundation; it was also supposed to be special, a finale for the festivities. Over 2,000 people had been at the Liceu, among them former players, managers and plenty of politicians, if not the mayor \u2013 he supports Espanyol \u2013 and on a sunny Saturday high above the city another 43,921 were coming to Montjuic to share the history, the moment.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/02/sahin-dortmund-kompany-bayern-munich-klassiker-bundesliga-blog\">Sahin\u2019s sober Dortmund finally click but canny Kompany has the answer | Andy Brassell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It didn\u2019t work out how they hoped, although it might have ended the way some suspected. In one part of the city, especially. At about the same time as Bar\u00e7a\u2019s players had sneaked out the Liceu, a mile away their opponents, recently touched down at El Prat, were dining on the eighth floor of their hotel overlooking the port, a perfect plan coming together.</p> \n<p>Las Palmas had come a long way \u2013 it\u2019s 2,173km from Gran Canaria \u2013 and were familiar guests. The team who turned up for the first game broadcast in Catalan after the end of the dictatorship; visitors the night Josep Taradellas, in exile since 1939, first went to Camp Nou; opponents when Barcelona won their first Copa under the democracy, they had been there <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/oct/02/barcelona-in-strange-and-symbolic-eye-of-a-storm-over-catalonia\">the day of the October 2017 referendum too</a>, Spain flags stitched into their shirts. They hadn\u2019t won any of those; this time, on Barcelona\u2019s 125th birthday, they did. It was their first victory at Barcelona since 1971, and the first home defeat for Hansi Flick\u2019s team all season. On this of all days.</p> \n<p>As one paper put it \u2013 as <em>every</em> paper put it, in fact \u2013 Las Palmas had poured water on the party, which is at least better than pooping on it. Barcelona had suffered a hell of a hangover, said the front page of El Mundo Deportivo. \u201cWhen you prepare a <em>fiesta</em>, it tends to end in a funeral,\u201d reckoned AS; on their 100th birthday, Barcelona had been beaten too, by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. And so it was: they had old shorts, white like the first day, a new anthem and a new mascot, designed by Carlos Grangel, but no win. Cat, who is a cat, got the first touch, taking the honorary kick-off. Two long exhausting hours later, Fabio Gonz\u00e1lez, born in Gran Canaria, got the last. Between those, goals from Sandro Ram\u00edrez and F\u00e1bio Silva had given Las Palmas a 2-1 lead and ultimately another win.</p> \n<p>They had defended that lead tooth and nail until the ball fell at Fabio\u2019s feet, the final whistle went, and subs and staff in yellow and blue ran on to the pitch \u2013 those that could still run, anyway. \u201cI hurt everywhere but right now I don\u2019t hurt at all,\u201d the centre-back \u00c1lex Su\u00e1rez said afterwards. Barcelona\u2019s captain Raphinha, meanwhile, just sat on the turf, lost. One by one, his opponents came to help him to his feet but he shrugged them off, staring into space, not quite Lesley Gore but not so far off. He had scored but, he said later, he didn\u2019t care. Asked to explain what had happened, he replied: \u201cThere is no explanation: we lost.\u201d Why? \u201cBecause we played badly.\u201d Another exchange ran: are you angry? \u201cYes.\u201d</p> \n<p>Well, of course. Barcelona had taken 27 shots and had hit the bar. Jasper Cillessen, who joked that he had got the inside track by watching Raphinha\u2019s clips on Instagram, made a superb stop from the Brazilian\u2019s free-kick. There had been missed chances and missed tackles too. A penalty shout or two. And yet this was no fluke, no freak result written off as luck and soon to be forgotten, I\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez admitting \u201cwe didn\u2019t feel right; it was hard for us to create, we lost the ball a lot\u201d and Flick adding: \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a really good match.\u201d Worse, it was no one-off. Instead, this was the third consecutive league game Barcelona had failed to win, the advantage they built blown already.</p> \n<p>Since they beat Real Madrid 4-0 in the <em>cl</em><em>\u00e1sico</em>, Barcelona have only defeated Espanyol, 3-1 in the derby, and even that day Flick said he wasn\u2019t happy, a three-goal first half giving way to a flat second. They then lost 1-0 to Real Sociedad, drew 2-2 at Celta Vigo, and now this. Eight points gone in three weeks. While the coach noted that they had key decisions go against them in all three matches, he was not handing responsibility to the refs and it is not about absentees either, although the four games that Barcelona have failed have been the four that Lamine Yamal has not started, and both Marc Casad\u00f3 and Dani Olmo were unable to play here. In fact, curiously, this run has happened as players have returned, the squad no longer quite so short.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/02/luis-enrique-can-no-longer-hide-behind-the-project-psg-need-wins\">Luis Enrique can no longer hide behind \u2018The Project\u2019 \u2013 PSG need wins | Luke Entwistle</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing badly?\u201d Raphinha was asked. \u201cMany things,\u201d he said, applying the full stop. And if some of it is temporary \u2013 \u201cWe had a great start, we have slowed a bit but I have no doubt we\u2019ll come through this,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said \u2013 right now it is also real. Flick suggested that there has been a lack of cohesion and insisted: \u201cWe have to defend better.\u201d They have to attack better too. Scoring the first goal changes everything, the coach said, but Mart\u00ednez admitted \u201cwe\u2019re struggling to create\u201d. In Lamine\u2019s absence, one of the front three has tended to be turned inside, instead of going for the throat. Robert Lewandowski looks his age again. The team that scored five against Villarreal and Sevilla, four against Girona and Madrid, 40 in 12 league games, plus four against Bayern, has three in three. The space into which they ran, identified now, is being closed; the space which they leave exposed, meanwhile, is exploited better.</p> \n<p>The edge, the intensity has gone from their game, the press applied a fraction late. The offside trap, which was always a way of living on the edge but looked like genius, now looks risky again, the timing needing fine-tuning. Identified now, it surprises less and opponents\u2019 movements are modified. Barcelona had caught the opposition offside 108 times until this run, averaging almost seven times a game. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 fell into the trap eight times alone, Madrid 12. Real Sociedad, though, fell just three times, Celta two. Las Palmas were caught five times on Saturday, but not only did both goals come from invading the space behind Barcelona, two other clear chances were worked the same way.</p> \n<p>And <em>worked</em> is the word, Mart\u00ednez saying the bit that too often goes unsaid: that there is another team and they are good, the side who had not won in 23 games racking up their fifth win in seven <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/11/las-palmas-diego-martinez-la-liga\">since Diego Mart\u00ednez took over</a>. A side in which everyone contributes. You would name their outstanding players at Montju\u00efc, only you would have to name them all. That said, some of the definitions in the Canarian daily <em>La Provincia</em> were fun and not far off: \u00c1lex Su\u00e1rez, the Tarzan of Tamaraceite. Scott McKenna, the banana Braveheart. Silva, the Robin Hood of glory. Javi Mu\u00f1oz, doctor of physics and fury. Enzo Loiodice, the marquis of the Eiffel Tower.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe knew Las Palmas could cause us problems; they could have scored more,\u201d Mart\u00ednez admitted. Watch the two goals again and they are wonderful, the ball taken from one end to the other, not by blind hoof but by design, one swift touch at a time, Barcelona drawn in and then defeated, space opened and occupied. \u201cIt\u2019s mechanised: we practised that all week. We know that they have a high line that works for them but it was good for us,\u201d Mika M\u00e1rmol said. \u201cWe thought we could win, we really believed it,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Campa\u00f1a said, and so it was.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe key was not to be small,\u201d Alberto Moleiro said; instead, they were as huge as the effort they had made, the front of one Las Palmas paper declaring them \u201cheroes\u201d, another calling this \u201cthe great apotheosis of the century\u201d, the \u201cmother of all feats\u201d. In the dressing room, music blared and players bounced about. Vicente G\u00f3mez, the former midfielder who was born on the island, played for them and works in the sporting directorate, was waiting. \u201cHe told me: \u2018You don\u2019t know what you have done,\u2019\u201d Su\u00e1rez revealed. This is the 75th year since Club Deportivo Gran Canaria, Real Club Victoria, Atletico Club, Arenas Club and Marino Club de Futbol became la Uni\u00f3n Deportiva, an anniversary of their own: for the last 50 of them, they had been unable to beat Barcelona. Now, though, they had, more history made and another party starting.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d38df8c2-8e43-4b04-baf1-da30ca73eee8\"

      "bodyText": "Barcelona left the party early, their birthday also belonging to those who travelled the furthest to be there. There was music, candles and a cake, a piano, five presidents and Pep Guardiola singing on the screen, or lip-syncing at least, but by the time the club\u2019s 125th-anniversary celebrations closed at the Liceu theatre on Friday night there were no first-team players. A little after half past nine, two hours into their grand gala on the Ramblas, a figure appeared in the shadow of the aisle and gestured to depart, 30 men in grey suits silently slipping out to prepare the final act, the crowning performance: in 14 hours they had a match to play. There have been thousands of them since 1899 when Mr Kans Kamper [sic] put a 63-word classified in Los Deportes asking if anyone wanted to play foot-vall and 12 turned up. The day after the gala would be Barcelona\u2019s 3,034th in La Liga alone, and the league hadn\u2019t even started for another 40 years after their foundation; it was also supposed to be special, a finale for the festivities. Over 2,000 people had been at the Liceu, among them former players, managers and plenty of politicians, if not the mayor \u2013 he supports Espanyol \u2013 and on a sunny Saturday high above the city another 43,921 were coming to Montjuic to share the history, the moment. It didn\u2019t work out how they hoped, although it might have ended the way some suspected. In one part of the city, especially. At about the same time as Bar\u00e7a\u2019s players had sneaked out the Liceu, a mile away their opponents, recently touched down at El Prat, were dining on the eighth floor of their hotel overlooking the port, a perfect plan coming together. Las Palmas had come a long way \u2013 it\u2019s 2,173km from Gran Canaria \u2013 and were familiar guests. The team who turned up for the first game broadcast in Catalan after the end of the dictatorship; visitors the night Josep Taradellas, in exile since 1939, first went to Camp Nou; opponents when Barcelona won their first Copa under the democracy, they had been there the day of the October 2017 referendum too, Spain flags stitched into their shirts. They hadn\u2019t won any of those; this time, on Barcelona\u2019s 125th birthday, they did. It was their first victory at Barcelona since 1971, and the first home defeat for Hansi Flick\u2019s team all season. On this of all days. As one paper put it \u2013 as every paper put it, in fact \u2013 Las Palmas had poured water on the party, which is at least better than pooping on it. Barcelona had suffered a hell of a hangover, said the front page of El Mundo Deportivo. \u201cWhen you prepare a fiesta, it tends to end in a funeral,\u201d reckoned AS; on their 100th birthday, Barcelona had been beaten too, by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. And so it was: they had old shorts, white like the first day, a new anthem and a new mascot, designed by Carlos Grangel, but no win. Cat, who is a cat, got the first touch, taking the honorary kick-off. Two long exhausting hours later, Fabio Gonz\u00e1lez, born in Gran Canaria, got the last. Between those, goals from Sandro Ram\u00edrez and F\u00e1bio Silva had given Las Palmas a 2-1 lead and ultimately another win. They had defended that lead tooth and nail until the ball fell at Fabio\u2019s feet, the final whistle went, and subs and staff in yellow and blue ran on to the pitch \u2013 those that could still run, anyway. \u201cI hurt everywhere but right now I don\u2019t hurt at all,\u201d the centre-back \u00c1lex Su\u00e1rez said afterwards. Barcelona\u2019s captain Raphinha, meanwhile, just sat on the turf, lost. One by one, his opponents came to help him to his feet but he shrugged them off, staring into space, not quite Lesley Gore but not so far off. He had scored but, he said later, he didn\u2019t care. Asked to explain what had happened, he replied: \u201cThere is no explanation: we lost.\u201d Why? \u201cBecause we played badly.\u201d Another exchange ran: are you angry? \u201cYes.\u201d Well, of course. Barcelona had taken 27 shots and had hit the bar. Jasper Cillessen, who joked that he had got the inside track by watching Raphinha\u2019s clips on Instagram, made a superb stop from the Brazilian\u2019s free-kick. There had been missed chances and missed tackles too. A penalty shout or two. And yet this was no fluke, no freak result written off as luck and soon to be forgotten, I\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez admitting \u201cwe didn\u2019t feel right; it was hard for us to create, we lost the ball a lot\u201d and Flick adding: \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a really good match.\u201d Worse, it was no one-off. Instead, this was the third consecutive league game Barcelona had failed to win, the advantage they built blown already. Since they beat Real Madrid 4-0 in the cl\u00e1sico, Barcelona have only defeated Espanyol, 3-1 in the derby, and even that day Flick said he wasn\u2019t happy, a three-goal first half giving way to a flat second. They then lost 1-0 to Real Sociedad, drew 2-2 at Celta Vigo, and now this. Eight points gone in three weeks. While the coach noted that they had key decisions go against them in all three matches, he was not handing responsibility to the refs and it is not about absentees either, although the four games that Barcelona have failed have been the four that Lamine Yamal has not started, and both Marc Casad\u00f3 and Dani Olmo were unable to play here. In fact, curiously, this run has happened as players have returned, the squad no longer quite so short. \u201cWhat are you doing badly?\u201d Raphinha was asked. \u201cMany things,\u201d he said, applying the full stop. And if some of it is temporary \u2013 \u201cWe had a great start, we have slowed a bit but I have no doubt we\u2019ll come through this,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said \u2013 right now it is also real. Flick suggested that there has been a lack of cohesion and insisted: \u201cWe have to defend better.\u201d They have to attack better too. Scoring the first goal changes everything, the coach said, but Mart\u00ednez admitted \u201cwe\u2019re struggling to create\u201d. In Lamine\u2019s absence, one of the front three has tended to be turned inside, instead of going for the throat. Robert Lewandowski looks his age again. The team that scored five against Villarreal and Sevilla, four against Girona and Madrid, 40 in 12 league games, plus four against Bayern, has three in three. The space into which they ran, identified now, is being closed; the space which they leave exposed, meanwhile, is exploited better. The edge, the intensity has gone from their game, the press applied a fraction late. The offside trap, which was always a way of living on the edge but looked like genius, now looks risky again, the timing needing fine-tuning. Identified now, it surprises less and opponents\u2019 movements are modified. Barcelona had caught the opposition offside 108 times until this run, averaging almost seven times a game. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 fell into the trap eight times alone, Madrid 12. Real Sociedad, though, fell just three times, Celta two. Las Palmas were caught five times on Saturday, but not only did both goals come from invading the space behind Barcelona, two other clear chances were worked the same way. And worked is the word, Mart\u00ednez saying the bit that too often goes unsaid: that there is another team and they are good, the side who had not won in 23 games racking up their fifth win in seven since Diego Mart\u00ednez took over. A side in which everyone contributes. You would name their outstanding players at Montju\u00efc, only you would have to name them all. That said, some of the definitions in the Canarian daily La Provincia were fun and not far off: \u00c1lex Su\u00e1rez, the Tarzan of Tamaraceite. Scott McKenna, the banana Braveheart. Silva, the Robin Hood of glory. Javi Mu\u00f1oz, doctor of physics and fury. Enzo Loiodice, the marquis of the Eiffel Tower. \u201cWe knew Las Palmas could cause us problems; they could have scored more,\u201d Mart\u00ednez admitted. Watch the two goals again and they are wonderful, the ball taken from one end to the other, not by blind hoof but by design, one swift touch at a time, Barcelona drawn in and then defeated, space opened and occupied. \u201cIt\u2019s mechanised: we practised that all week. We know that they have a high line that works for them but it was good for us,\u201d Mika M\u00e1rmol said. \u201cWe thought we could win, we really believed it,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Campa\u00f1a said, and so it was. \u201cThe key was not to be small,\u201d Alberto Moleiro said; instead, they were as huge as the effort they had made, the front of one Las Palmas paper declaring them \u201cheroes\u201d, another calling this \u201cthe great apotheosis of the century\u201d, the \u201cmother of all feats\u201d. In the dressing room, music blared and players bounced about. Vicente G\u00f3mez, the former midfielder who was born on the island, played for them and works in the sporting directorate, was waiting. \u201cHe told me: \u2018You don\u2019t know what you have done,\u2019\u201d Su\u00e1rez revealed. This is the 75th year since Club Deportivo Gran Canaria, Real Club Victoria, Atletico Club, Arenas Club and Marino Club de Futbol became la Uni\u00f3n Deportiva, an anniversary of their own: for the last 50 of them, they had been unable to beat Barcelona. Now, though, they had, more history made and another party starting.",

The question of whether Venus has ever been habitable \u2013 and might yet host life in its acidic clouds \u2013 has long been a hot topic among scientists.

Most of that is water,\u201d she said. But if the magma cooled slowly, water would have ended up as steam in the atmosphere. Crucially, in this scenario, water would not be trapped inside the interior of the planet. Writing in the journal Nature Astronomy, Constantinou and colleagues report how they studied the chemistry of the planet\u2019s atmosphere to shed light on the water content of its interior. The team said the unchanging nature of Venus\u2019s atmosphere meant the rate at which substances were lost must equal the rate at which they were replaced, with the latter driven by volcanic activity. However, when the team analysed the ratios of substances being replenished in the Venusian atmosphere, they found very little water was being added; in other words, volcanic eruptions were \u201cdry\u201d. \u201cThe scarcity of water in volcanic emissions reflects an equally dry Venusian interior,\u201d said Constantinou. The team said the findings were not consistent with Venus having had surface oceans of water in its past, and hence a climate traditionally considered habitable. The team\u2019s conclusion could soon be tested: later this decade, Nasa is due to launch the DaVinci mission to carry out flybys of Venus and drop a probe to its surface. Constantinou said resolving the question could help astronomers narrow down their search for habitable planets beyond our solar system. \u201c[Earth and Venus] provide this natural laboratory really close to us for studying how habitability, or the lack of it, evolves,\u201d she said.",

In early November, McGorry posted another video, in which he encouraged people to mitigate risk for themselves and others by wearing a mask in essential places like doctors\u2019 offices and pharmacies. \u201cHaving to still think about Covid fucking sucks. Trust me, I get it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut empathy alone is not enough without actions of solidarity.\u201d</p> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/health/long-covid-world.html\">one report</a>, 400 million people have been affected by long Covid. But it is under-diagnosed and misunderstood. McGorry said in the video he hesitated to speak publicly about his health \u201cprimarily because of fear of career discrimination and also people making assumptions about what I can and can\u2019t do\u201d.</p> \n<p>I spoke to McGorry over video chat in mid-November about his diagnosis and sharing his story. \u201cI want able people to learn from disabled people,\u201d he said, listing Alice Wong\u2019s Disability Intimacy and Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha\u2019s Care Work and The Future Is Disabled as useful books.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been organizing white people for anti-racism for quite a few years,\u201d he said. \u201cThose conversations are so different than a conversation where your own life is impacted. I\u2019m happy to say, here are the resources, but having to convince people that accessibility and disability justice are social justice issues in the first place is incredibly dehumanizing and exhausting and usually very fruitless.\u201d</p> \n<p>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p> \n<p><strong>How did you decide to share your long Covid experience publicly?</strong></p> \n<p>The first time I got Covid was 11 days after my dad passed away. I was feeling fatigue and brain fog, which I thought were probably associated with the grief.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/\" data-alt=\"Well actually sign-up widget\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>I was in denial about it, because I knew there\u2019s no easy fix. I knew that if I did have long Covid, that I probably couldn\u2019t afford to get it again, and if I couldn\u2019t afford to get it again, then everything in my life would have to change. Breaking out of that denial was the first step.</p> \n<p>I also wanted to wait until my health wasn\u2019t actively declining, and understand where I was with my relationships in my life. Stress, at least for me, is an activator of symptoms.</p> \n<p><strong>Being somebody with a public profile, were you worried about criticism? Was there a negative response?</strong></p> \n<p>In my personal life, I tell everyone that I have long Covid, because I want everyone to know that it exists. The guy who\u2019s taking 27 vials of my blood in a lab, he\u2019s like, \u201cDamn, that\u2019s a lot of vials.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s for long Covid.\u201d [With a wider audience,] it\u2019s really more about the fear of people making assumptions about my abilities, and therefore my ability to work.</p> \n<p>One of the most common ways disabled people are discriminated against is people making assumptions about their capacities and not consulting them about it. But what was even more vulnerable, honestly, was the second video: making asks about people in my community wearing masks in essential places where disabled people have to be.</p> \n<p>I\u2019m new to experiencing it first-hand, but a lot of the systemic oppression that disabled people face is neglect. It may not be outright vitriol. If you don\u2019t take the action to make the space accessible, we can\u2019t be there, or we can\u2019t be there safely. We have to risk our lives. If you cut the funding for programs that people need to survive, you just get people who kind of fall by the wayside, in the words of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-66643426\">Anthony Fauci</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>What made you first suspect you had </strong><strong>long Covid?</strong></p> \n<p>Fatigue is still the main symptom. If everything else stayed the same and the fatigue went away, or even improved by half, I would feel extremely grateful for that. Learning about <a href=\"https://meassociation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/PACING-Activity-and-Energy-Management-for-people-with-MECFS-and-Long-Covid-MAY-2023-1.pdf\">pacing</a> was pretty huge for me.</p> \n<p>I was also using stimulants to be able to get through my day. I\u2019d have a scoop of pre-workout in the morning to answer emails. If I push up to the point where I get brain fatigue, I start to feel like shit, basically. The fatigue becomes exponential very quickly. It wasn\u2019t until later that I realized that when I reach the limit, that is because I\u2019ve gotten beyond it, and that has a cost. Starting to use wearable tracking [devices] allowed me to see, like, my heart rate is tachycardic when I have this caffeine.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/19/a-30-second-walk-would-exhaust-me-natacha-life-with-long-covid\">\u2018A 30-second walk would exhaust me beyond reason\u2019: Natacha\u2019s life with long Covid</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Memorizing lines was becoming hard. Or doing cold reads, where you get handed the script, which requires a lot of multitasking: you\u2019re looking at the script, engaging with the person, hitting the marks. I felt like I kept missing the turn, you know: driving by and you\u2019re like, shit, that\u2019s my turn. Some of that cognitive stuff has gotten better, but it\u2019s incredibly scary. I can still do my job as an actor as long as it\u2019s safe for me. The long Covid itself doesn\u2019t preclude me from being able to do it.</p> \n<p>I went to a long Covid clinic in Los Angeles about a year ago. They had a long survey [about symptoms]. The amount of things that I was saying yes to validated that all these different things are connected.</p> \n<p><strong>We\u2019re used to being told that you get healthier by putting in effort. But with long </strong><strong>Covid, to recover, many experts say to do less and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/21/long-covid-recovery-coronavirus\">rest</a>.</strong></p> \n<p>I was a personal trainer for a decade, including during my first two seasons of Orange Is the New Black. I was heavily indoctrinated into diet culture and thin supremacy. We\u2019re taught you just have to keep pushing. A person that I help care for is mostly housebound, and often bed-bound. I was in a session with them with a neurologist recently, who was like, \u201cBut you should get up and walk around the block.\u201d So it runs deep.</p> \n<p><strong>Long </strong><strong>Covid is a relatively new disease, and the science is developing. You say in the video you had to become your own expert. What does that mean?</strong></p> \n<p>Part of it is doctors only have so much time \u2013 particularly long Covid clinics. Even for people who have access to resources, like hiring a concierge doctor, there\u2019s only so much that they can do.</p> \n<p>Most of the disabled people I know who have long Covid probably read more studies about it than most doctors. I\u2019ve started keeping a health journal. Once a week, I do a self-check-in: these are the meds that I\u2019m taking or that I\u2019ve changed dose on; this symptom seems new or different.</p> \n<p>As an able-bodied person, you trust that your doctor is going to steer the ship if something pops up. But if I were to wait for them and not be proactive, my health would have continued to decline. So, for me, it looks like reading studies, following people who are at the forefront of the science, and cross-referencing with other people in the [long Covid] community. There\u2019s a group in Los Angeles called the Wayside, after Dr Fauci\u2019s comment. We share resources and talk about what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not working, and how to navigate the systems.</p> \n<p>Before I had long Covid, when I was unconsciously invested in ideas of health and goodness and virtue, there was pride in being a good patient at the doctor. They\u2019d be like, wow, you\u2019re so fit, or whatever. The more you have a complex illness, the more you end up having to push and advocate for certain things, including masking in the offices, which is absolutely exhausting.</p> \n<p>I had been dealing with a vascular lesion in my quad for a year and some pain in my knees. The orthopedist said, \u201cYour cartilage is worn down.\u201d We didn\u2019t do a scan or anything. So I went to rehab for eight months. I ended up basically asking, \u201cCan I get a scan?\u201d There wasn\u2019t a cartilage issue \u2013 I had a torn meniscus. The doctor assumed that I had a cartilage issue because of my higher body weight instead of scanning for something that could actually be fixed.</p> \n<p>With the quad, the doctor said it could be cancer. Wildly, I thought, well, maybe if I have cancer, at least people will listen to me. Before going to the oncologist\u2019s office, I\u2019d asked if he could wear an N95, and the staff said he\u2019s not really a masker. He walks in the room and he starts putting the mask on. And he says, \u201cWe\u2019ll do this quickly before I suffocate.\u201d</p> \n<p>I think people don\u2019t understand that. You\u2019re asking, \u201cHey, would you mind protecting my life?\u201d When someone\u2019s like, \u201cOh God, what a pain in the ass,\u201d experiences like that make you reticent to ask in the future.</p> \n<p><strong>You mentioned being a caretaker for someone who also has long </strong><strong>Covid.

      "bodyText": "On 28 October, Matt McGorry posted a video to Instagram. \u201cThis is definitely the most vulnerable thing I\u2019ve ever shared, and is a conversation I haven\u2019t even had with a lot of my closest friends,\u201d he said. The actor, known for roles in Orange Is the New Black and How to Get Away With Murder, revealed he had \u201cnever fully recovered\u201d after two Covid infections. \u201cLong Covid has dramatically changed my life,\u201d said McGorry, describing symptoms including debilitating fatigue, depression, dysautonomia, Raynaud\u2019s disease and brain fog, which he called \u201ca cute little name for brain damage\u201d. \u201cSome things that I love that I can\u2019t do any more are exercising, lifting weights, hiking and reading an hour a day,\u201d he said. In early November, McGorry posted another video, in which he encouraged people to mitigate risk for themselves and others by wearing a mask in essential places like doctors\u2019 offices and pharmacies. \u201cHaving to still think about Covid fucking sucks. Trust me, I get it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut empathy alone is not enough without actions of solidarity.\u201d According to one report, 400 million people have been affected by long Covid. But it is under-diagnosed and misunderstood. McGorry said in the video he hesitated to speak publicly about his health \u201cprimarily because of fear of career discrimination and also people making assumptions about what I can and can\u2019t do\u201d. I spoke to McGorry over video chat in mid-November about his diagnosis and sharing his story. \u201cI want able people to learn from disabled people,\u201d he said, listing Alice Wong\u2019s Disability Intimacy and Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha\u2019s Care Work and The Future Is Disabled as useful books. \u201cI\u2019ve been organizing white people for anti-racism for quite a few years,\u201d he said. \u201cThose conversations are so different than a conversation where your own life is impacted. I\u2019m happy to say, here are the resources, but having to convince people that accessibility and disability justice are social justice issues in the first place is incredibly dehumanizing and exhausting and usually very fruitless.\u201d This interview has been edited for length and clarity. How did you decide to share your long Covid experience publicly? The first time I got Covid was 11 days after my dad passed away. I was feeling fatigue and brain fog, which I thought were probably associated with the grief. I was in denial about it, because I knew there\u2019s no easy fix. I knew that if I did have long Covid, that I probably couldn\u2019t afford to get it again, and if I couldn\u2019t afford to get it again, then everything in my life would have to change. Breaking out of that denial was the first step. I also wanted to wait until my health wasn\u2019t actively declining, and understand where I was with my relationships in my life. Stress, at least for me, is an activator of symptoms. Being somebody with a public profile, were you worried about criticism? Was there a negative response? In my personal life, I tell everyone that I have long Covid, because I want everyone to know that it exists. The guy who\u2019s taking 27 vials of my blood in a lab, he\u2019s like, \u201cDamn, that\u2019s a lot of vials.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s for long Covid.\u201d [With a wider audience,] it\u2019s really more about the fear of people making assumptions about my abilities, and therefore my ability to work. One of the most common ways disabled people are discriminated against is people making assumptions about their capacities and not consulting them about it. But what was even more vulnerable, honestly, was the second video: making asks about people in my community wearing masks in essential places where disabled people have to be. I\u2019m new to experiencing it first-hand, but a lot of the systemic oppression that disabled people face is neglect. It may not be outright vitriol. If you don\u2019t take the action to make the space accessible, we can\u2019t be there, or we can\u2019t be there safely. We have to risk our lives. If you cut the funding for programs that people need to survive, you just get people who kind of fall by the wayside, in the words of Anthony Fauci. What made you first suspect you had long Covid? Fatigue is still the main symptom. If everything else stayed the same and the fatigue went away, or even improved by half, I would feel extremely grateful for that. Learning about pacing was pretty huge for me. I was also using stimulants to be able to get through my day. I\u2019d have a scoop of pre-workout in the morning to answer emails. If I push up to the point where I get brain fatigue, I start to feel like shit, basically. The fatigue becomes exponential very quickly. It wasn\u2019t until later that I realized that when I reach the limit, that is because I\u2019ve gotten beyond it, and that has a cost. Starting to use wearable tracking [devices] allowed me to see, like, my heart rate is tachycardic when I have this caffeine. Memorizing lines was becoming hard. Or doing cold reads, where you get handed the script, which requires a lot of multitasking: you\u2019re looking at the script, engaging with the person, hitting the marks. I felt like I kept missing the turn, you know: driving by and you\u2019re like, shit, that\u2019s my turn. Some of that cognitive stuff has gotten better, but it\u2019s incredibly scary. I can still do my job as an actor as long as it\u2019s safe for me. The long Covid itself doesn\u2019t preclude me from being able to do it. I went to a long Covid clinic in Los Angeles about a year ago. They had a long survey [about symptoms]. The amount of things that I was saying yes to validated that all these different things are connected. We\u2019re used to being told that you get healthier by putting in effort. But with long Covid, to recover, many experts say to do less and rest. I was a personal trainer for a decade, including during my first two seasons of Orange Is the New Black. I was heavily indoctrinated into diet culture and thin supremacy. We\u2019re taught you just have to keep pushing. A person that I help care for is mostly housebound, and often bed-bound. I was in a session with them with a neurologist recently, who was like, \u201cBut you should get up and walk around the block.\u201d So it runs deep. Long Covid is a relatively new disease, and the science is developing. You say in the video you had to become your own expert. What does that mean? Part of it is doctors only have so much time \u2013 particularly long Covid clinics. Even for people who have access to resources, like hiring a concierge doctor, there\u2019s only so much that they can do. Most of the disabled people I know who have long Covid probably read more studies about it than most doctors. I\u2019ve started keeping a health journal. Once a week, I do a self-check-in: these are the meds that I\u2019m taking or that I\u2019ve changed dose on; this symptom seems new or different. As an able-bodied person, you trust that your doctor is going to steer the ship if something pops up. But if I were to wait for them and not be proactive, my health would have continued to decline. So, for me, it looks like reading studies, following people who are at the forefront of the science, and cross-referencing with other people in the [long Covid] community. There\u2019s a group in Los Angeles called the Wayside, after Dr Fauci\u2019s comment. We share resources and talk about what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not working, and how to navigate the systems. Before I had long Covid, when I was unconsciously invested in ideas of health and goodness and virtue, there was pride in being a good patient at the doctor. They\u2019d be like, wow, you\u2019re so fit, or whatever. The more you have a complex illness, the more you end up having to push and advocate for certain things, including masking in the offices, which is absolutely exhausting. I had been dealing with a vascular lesion in my quad for a year and some pain in my knees. The orthopedist said, \u201cYour cartilage is worn down.\u201d We didn\u2019t do a scan or anything. So I went to rehab for eight months. I ended up basically asking, \u201cCan I get a scan?\u201d There wasn\u2019t a cartilage issue \u2013 I had a torn meniscus. The doctor assumed that I had a cartilage issue because of my higher body weight instead of scanning for something that could actually be fixed. With the quad, the doctor said it could be cancer. Wildly, I thought, well, maybe if I have cancer, at least people will listen to me. Before going to the oncologist\u2019s office, I\u2019d asked if he could wear an N95, and the staff said he\u2019s not really a masker. He walks in the room and he starts putting the mask on. And he says, \u201cWe\u2019ll do this quickly before I suffocate.\u201d I think people don\u2019t understand that. You\u2019re asking, \u201cHey, would you mind protecting my life?\u201d When someone\u2019s like, \u201cOh God, what a pain in the ass,\u201d experiences like that make you reticent to ask in the future. You mentioned being a caretaker for someone who also has long Covid. How does care work affect your life? The most challenging part about it is witnessing the ableism that person experiences. Having felt how terrifying it is to feel like your health is free-falling in a world, a system, a country that does not value disabled people and does not value people without their labor has been clarifying to me on how I want to be able to show up for someone else. When I have my own limited energy, it\u2019s hard to want to be able to do more, and feel like the capacity is not there. That becomes more and more scary, the more disabled someone becomes, because they inevitably need more support. It\u2019s extremely challenging emotionally and physically, and also, I recognize, some of the most important work that I\u2019ve been involved in. There is a beauty in access intimacy, where because you both are dealing with the same thing to varying degrees, you have some ability to understand what the other person needs. Not having to ask for every single thing is a way of feeling seen that is really beautiful. How has your experience of chronic illness changed your idea of health and your relationship to it?

      "bodyText": "Virgil van Dijk believes Liverpool found the \u201cperfect match\u201d for their tight-knit, experienced squad when appointing Arne Slot as J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s successor. Slot\u2019s stunning start continued on Sunday with a dominant win against Manchester City, who trail the Premier League leaders by 11 points with just over a third of the season gone. The 46-year-old has won 90% of his matches, including against the champions of Europe and of England in the space of five days, to take Liverpool top of the Premier League and Champions League. Van Dijk admits Slot inherited a squad full of quality and spirit from Klopp but says the head coach takes credit for making the difficult task of replacing a club legend look seamless. The Liverpool captain said: \u201cI think the step from, with all respect, the Dutch league to the Premier League is a big one in terms of being a player but for a manager it is exactly the same. He has done very well so far and he has, in my opinion, inherited a very good squad not only as football players but as human beings \u2013 guys who will go to war for each other \u2013 and I think he has been so far so good. \u201cIt was always going to be difficult to replace J\u00fcrgen for everything he did for us, as players and for the club. But he has done it his own way together with the staff, and made sure we have the quality to improve and win games. He makes sure we keep working, are not satisfied and focus on what is ahead of us next and keep improving. You see the patterns we try to do, you see we can change in games or at half-time and it\u2019s obviously a big credit to him.\u201d Van Dijk insists Slot\u2019s style and character are ideal for a Liverpool team also prospering thanks to stability and experience on the playing side. \u201cI think the club decided this could be the perfect match for the group here,\u201d the defender said. \u201cHe made one addition in terms of Federico [Chiesa] but apart from that the group has been very tight, and over the years we have worked together and been through so much together that they thought this could be a good match on and off the pitch. We have the players to play how he wants to play but still we have to execute it well. We still have things to improve. In games we have struggled sometimes but we have found a way, found answers to difficult moments, and that is key to winning games.\u201d Liverpool will be without Ibrahima Konat\u00e9, Conor Bradley and Kostas Tsimikas when visiting Newcastle on Wednesday and Everton on Saturday and the trio could miss the hectic festive schedule. Konat\u00e9 is on crutches after sustaining a knee injury against Real Madrid. The first-choice goalkeeper, Alisson, has been a long-term absentee but is nearing a return. Van Dijk said of Liverpool\u2019s lead in the Premier League: \u201cIt feels solid. It feels that we are making good steps. I want to be there at the end of the season \u2013 that\u2019s the aim \u2013 and we can\u2019t think about what\u2019s there in January or February. Now it\u2019s Newcastle and doing everything in our power to be ready for a big one there as well.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>LET\u2019S TALK ABOUT SIX, BABY</strong></h2> <p>Towards the end of his beleaguered Manchester City side\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/01/liverpool-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">trimming</a> at the hands of Liverpool at Anfield, Pep Guardiola raised a couple of hands of his own but far from surrendering in the same manner as the players he had picked, the Spaniard was in defiant mood. Turning in his technical area to acknowledge the scouse serenade of \u201cYou\u2019re getting sacked in the morning!\u201d echoing around the ground, the City boss chomped hard on the bait and raised six digits to remind all those in the chorus how many Premier League titles he has won. Unfortunately for him it is also the same number of games his team have now lost in their past seven outings, a statistic quickly seized upon by assorted Social Media Disgrace wags who wished to pile even more ridicule on poor old Pep.</p> <p>Apparently labouring under the delusion that the taunts were more of a demand than a speculative observation, Guardiola responded to gentle probing about them after the game. \u201cThey want to sack me,\u201d he said of the Liverpool fans. \u201cI wish they were more kind. Why didn\u2019t they do it at 0-1? Why didn\u2019t they do it last season when we won the Premier League? Why do they want to sack me now?\u201d Rushing to defend his manager\u2019s reaction with all the artfulness with which he had demonstrated while racing to the edge of his area to hurl himself at the feet of Luis D\u00edaz and give away the match-winning penalty, Stefan Ortega added his two cents, going in two-footed on the entire city of Liverpool. \u201cSomeone told me before that this area is probably not the best part of the UK,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/01/pep-guardiola-says-he-expected-more-of-anfield-after-sack-chants\">he blathered</a>, displaying the kind of tact and diplomacy that would make even an under-siege Master Chef blanche, to round off a day to forget for all associated with Manchester City but one that will live long in the memory of all Liverpool fans.</p> <p>Having masterminded the fourth consecutive Premier League defeat to which Pep Guardiola\u2019s side have been subjected and seen his own team go nine points clear of their nearest rivals, Arne Slot was asked if he felt sorry for the unprecedented hardships currently being visited upon his opposite number and was refreshingly candid in his assessment of Pep\u2019s situation. \u201cYou feel sympathy or empathy with the managers in a really bad place,\u201d he soothed. \u201cThey have lost many games or are down at the bottom of the league, but Pep has won so many things and he has shown so many times already, so that is why the league is not decided in November or December. Last season they were eight points behind Arsenal I think in February, so no one has to feel sympathy or empathy for Pep, maybe for other managers, but not Pep.\u201d While Slot is right to point out that the season is still young and Guardiola could still turn things around, all evidence suggests things could get a lot worse for the City boss before they get better.</p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve been criticised since I was a 16-year-old boy, my whole career. What you always want is weapons to fight back with \u2013 at the minute we\u2019ve got none. So we have to take it on the chin and hope that we get through this, because the last two games arguably have been the toughest and hardest week of my managerial career. It was very difficult walking over and not feel embarrassed to show our appreciation to the fans\u201d \u2013 the behind-the-scenes Plymouth Argyle documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/01/wayne-rooney-fighting-to-save-plymouth-argyle-job-after-latest-defeat\">is in danger of having its lead character killed off in the first episode</a> after the Pilgrims\u2019 4-0 thrashing at Bristol City.</p> </blockquote>    <h2><strong>RECOMMENDED LISTENING</strong></h2> <p>Is the Premier League title already Liverpool\u2019s to lose?

He tried to linger, offered a single finger (plus five), but he\u2019d seen a Red humdinger. City will back him, no chance they\u2019ll sack him. But with Pep being slighted, and weaknesses sighted, could he even be caught by Rub\u00e9n\u2019s United? (I know I ought to get out more, but you know what, I don\u2019t even care)\u201d \u2013 Mark McFadden.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After a 2-0 defeat, a warning for City fans: taking too much Peptalk Dismal can increase the risk of side effects, including feeling or being sick, feeling confused, dizzy or tired, deafness, or ringing or buzzing in your ears\u201d \u2013 James Boyle.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As an Arsenal supporter, I found myself cheering on Liverpool yesterday, even though I probably should have been hoping for a City win. I think I\u2019ve been hurt so often by City that I\u2019m having trouble being rational. My psychiatrist says I have PTSD: Pep Traumatic Stress Disorder. She thinks I\u2019ve lost touch with reality when I suggest he\u2019s just bored and toying with us, seeing how far he can fall behind before City win their final 25 matches with a goal difference of 107 and take the title by 10 points at a canter again\u201d \u2013 Chris Jersan.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What a difference six years makes.

      "bodyText": "LET\u2019S TALK ABOUT SIX, BABY Towards the end of his beleaguered Manchester City side\u2019s trimming at the hands of Liverpool at Anfield, Pep Guardiola raised a couple of hands of his own but far from surrendering in the same manner as the players he had picked, the Spaniard was in defiant mood. Turning in his technical area to acknowledge the scouse serenade of \u201cYou\u2019re getting sacked in the morning!\u201d echoing around the ground, the City boss chomped hard on the bait and raised six digits to remind all those in the chorus how many Premier League titles he has won. Unfortunately for him it is also the same number of games his team have now lost in their past seven outings, a statistic quickly seized upon by assorted Social Media Disgrace wags who wished to pile even more ridicule on poor old Pep. Apparently labouring under the delusion that the taunts were more of a demand than a speculative observation, Guardiola responded to gentle probing about them after the game. \u201cThey want to sack me,\u201d he said of the Liverpool fans. \u201cI wish they were more kind. Why didn\u2019t they do it at 0-1? Why didn\u2019t they do it last season when we won the Premier League? Why do they want to sack me now?\u201d Rushing to defend his manager\u2019s reaction with all the artfulness with which he had demonstrated while racing to the edge of his area to hurl himself at the feet of Luis D\u00edaz and give away the match-winning penalty, Stefan Ortega added his two cents, going in two-footed on the entire city of Liverpool. \u201cSomeone told me before that this area is probably not the best part of the UK,\u201d he blathered, displaying the kind of tact and diplomacy that would make even an under-siege Master Chef blanche, to round off a day to forget for all associated with Manchester City but one that will live long in the memory of all Liverpool fans. Having masterminded the fourth consecutive Premier League defeat to which Pep Guardiola\u2019s side have been subjected and seen his own team go nine points clear of their nearest rivals, Arne Slot was asked if he felt sorry for the unprecedented hardships currently being visited upon his opposite number and was refreshingly candid in his assessment of Pep\u2019s situation. \u201cYou feel sympathy or empathy with the managers in a really bad place,\u201d he soothed. \u201cThey have lost many games or are down at the bottom of the league, but Pep has won so many things and he has shown so many times already, so that is why the league is not decided in November or December. Last season they were eight points behind Arsenal I think in February, so no one has to feel sympathy or empathy for Pep, maybe for other managers, but not Pep.\u201d While Slot is right to point out that the season is still young and Guardiola could still turn things around, all evidence suggests things could get a lot worse for the City boss before they get better. QUOTE OF THE DAY I\u2019ve been criticised since I was a 16-year-old boy, my whole career. What you always want is weapons to fight back with \u2013 at the minute we\u2019ve got none. So we have to take it on the chin and hope that we get through this, because the last two games arguably have been the toughest and hardest week of my managerial career. It was very difficult walking over and not feel embarrassed to show our appreciation to the fans\u201d \u2013 the behind-the-scenes Plymouth Argyle documentary is in danger of having its lead character killed off in the first episode after the Pilgrims\u2019 4-0 thrashing at Bristol City. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Is the Premier League title already Liverpool\u2019s to lose? Join Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning and the Football Weekly pod squad as they discuss this and more. FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS The post-Klopp Kop had a pop at Pep. He tried to linger, offered a single finger (plus five), but he\u2019d seen a Red humdinger. City will back him, no chance they\u2019ll sack him. But with Pep being slighted, and weaknesses sighted, could he even be caught by Rub\u00e9n\u2019s United? (I know I ought to get out more, but you know what, I don\u2019t even care)\u201d \u2013 Mark McFadden. After a 2-0 defeat, a warning for City fans: taking too much Peptalk Dismal can increase the risk of side effects, including feeling or being sick, feeling confused, dizzy or tired, deafness, or ringing or buzzing in your ears\u201d \u2013 James Boyle. As an Arsenal supporter, I found myself cheering on Liverpool yesterday, even though I probably should have been hoping for a City win. I think I\u2019ve been hurt so often by City that I\u2019m having trouble being rational. My psychiatrist says I have PTSD: Pep Traumatic Stress Disorder. She thinks I\u2019ve lost touch with reality when I suggest he\u2019s just bored and toying with us, seeing how far he can fall behind before City win their final 25 matches with a goal difference of 107 and take the title by 10 points at a canter again\u201d \u2013 Chris Jersan. What a difference six years makes. From Scott McTominay getting stick from the Manchester United fans just for passing the ball backwards, all the way back in the days when they used to beat Liverpool (and with the Once a Special One, then a Happy One, now a Moaning in Turkey One, doing a once in a lifetime \u2018blame me not the player\u2019), to scoring the winner to boost Napoli\u2019s title bid. As Andy Gray used to patronisingly say on co-commentary after someone, probably Robert Pires, scored a world class goal in the early 2000s, \u2018Take a bow son, take a bow\u2019\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis. \u2022 Send letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

      "bodyText": "France\u2019s centre-right prime minister, Michel Barnier, has told parliament that he will push the government\u2019s proposed social security budget through without a vote, using a constitutional measure known as article 49.3. The decision means France\u2019s government will face a vote of confidence from opposition parties, very likely on Wednesday, and could be toppled by the end of the week. Here\u2019s a brief guide to how it happened \u2013 and what may come next. What is article 49.3 and why is it being used? Article 49.3 of France\u2019s constitution allows a government to pass new legislation without parliament\u2019s approval \u2013 but in return it gives MPs the chance to challenge that decision by presenting a no-confidence motion within 24 hours. It must be voted on within 48 hours. If the motion is successful the legislation is rejected and the government is deemed to have collapsed. Both the left-leaning New Popular Front (NFP) and the far-right National Rally party (RN) of Marine Le Pen said on Monday they would submit votes of no confidence. The Barnier government\u2019s problems stem from President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s decision to dissolve parliament in June and hold early elections after his centrist forces suffered a humiliating defeat in that month\u2019s European parliament ballot. In the resulting general election, the NFP, a coalition of left-leaning parties ranging from the mainstream Socialist party (PS) to the radical-left Unbowed France (LFI) headed by the political firebrand Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, won the largest number of seats. Macron\u2019s alliance was beaten into second place and the RN, although it finished as the largest single party, placed third. Parliament was therefore divided into three roughly equal blocs \u2013 left, centre and right/far right \u2013 none of which had a majority. Why is this happening now? Macron rejected the NFP\u2019s claim that as the largest parliamentary force it should name the new head of government and appointed Barnier, a veteran conservative, as prime minister after weeks of talks, backed by a fragile alliance of centrist and centre-right MPs. Since then, the NFP has consistently voted against the government. The far-right RN, however, which under Le Pen has spent years trying to position itself as a responsible party of future government, has so far refrained from trying to take down the government. By acting tough on some of the RN\u2019s hot-button issues such as crime, security and immigration, and compromising on some of the far-right party\u2019s other red lines, such as measures to ease the cost of living, Barnier had hoped to keep the RN on board for as long as possible.

Barnier has said there could be \u201cserious financial turbulence\u201d if his budget fails to pass and the government falls, and markets have already responded with alarm, with the interest rate on French bonds coming close to that of their Greek counterparts last week.

Although the NFP has frequently appeared fractured, there is no guarantee that would work. Macron could also decide to appoint a technocratic government to oversee France\u2019s administration for another six months. Finally, he could himself resign, triggering new presidential elections, but for the time being that is seen as unlikely. Even though Le Pen is saying her party will back a no-confidence vote, the RN could yet change tack and hold fire this time. The final opportunity this year for it to topple the government would be on the last budget vote on 20 December, and many observers still question what political gain there is for Le Pen in bringing Barnier down now.",

      "body": "<p>The best description of Ireland\u2019s political landscape after Friday\u2019s general election might be: strangely familiar. The familiar bit is easy. The two main incumbent parties, Miche\u00e1l Martin\u2019s Fianna F\u00e1il and Simon Harris\u2019s Fine Gael, received almost exactly the same combined share of the vote (43%) as they did in 2020. As a result, the identical twins of Irish politics that have governed the state since it came into being just over a century ago will continue to do so.</p> <p>One of them, Fianna F\u00e1il, which has <a href=\"https://www.rte.ie/news/election-24/results/#/national\">won the most seats</a> this time, emerged as the dominant political machine in the 1930s and was almost permanently in charge until its vote imploded in 2011 after the <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/death_of_the_celtic_tiger/\">bloody death of the Celtic Tiger</a>. It is now edging back, if not towards its old ascendancy, then certainly into a comfortable seat at the centre of power. Its like-minded partner, Fine Gael, has been continually in government in one form or another since 2011, and if the incoming administration lasts a full term it will remain there until 2029.</p> <p>So, same old, same old. But this familiarity itself feels strange. At the most obvious level, in this global year of elections, Irish voters have bucked the trend established by their counterparts in Britain, the US, France, Japan and South Africa and have declined to give the incumbents a good kicking. Amid the turbulence of so much of the democratic world, Ireland seems, on the surface at least, perversely calm.</p> <p>Below the surface, though, there are paradoxes and perplexities. This was no simple vote of confidence in the status quo. Whatever the electorate in Ireland\u2019s increasingly complex and fragmented political system is saying, it is something much more ambiguous than a big thumbs-up emoji.</p> <p>The first oddity to be understood is that the Fianna F\u00e1il-Fine Gael duopoly is in fact a declining force. As recently as 2007, the twins had almost 70% of the vote between them. Considering that Ireland has <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/07/03/irish-unemployment-rises-marginally-to-42/\">in effect full employment</a>, a massively expanded workforce, overflowing public coffers and a booming export-led economy, it may seem puzzling that the two parties are now very far from being able to command the loyalty of even half the voters.</p> <p>They can, after all, claim with a great deal of justification that they have turned what was once one of western Europe\u2019s poorest countries into a wealthy society. They have transformed a place of departure, shaped by generations of mass emigration and depopulation, into a place of arrival in which <a href=\"https://gript.ie/almost-20-of-those-living-in-ireland-are-foreign-born/\">one in five</a> residents were born outside Ireland. They have steered the country through the crises of Brexit and Covid with a competence that was all the more reassuring for the contrast it provided to the anarchic politics across the Irish Sea and the Atlantic. So how come they have received such a lukewarm endorsement?</p> <p>Usually, the obvious explanation would be the popularity of the main opposition party \u2013 in this case Sinn F\u00e9in. Two or three years ago, this reasoning would have made sense. Sinn F\u00e9in, led by the brilliant campaigner Mary Lou McDonald, was polling at <a href=\"https://pollingindicator.com/\">well over 30%</a> and there was a common assumption that it was within striking distance of being able to form the next government with a coalition of leftwing parties.</p> <p>But the opposite has happened. McDonald did indeed run a very good campaign and her party produced detailed and costed proposals to address two of the outgoing government\u2019s biggest failures: a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/11/ireland-housing-crisis-far-right-europe-refugees\">grossly inadequate supply of housing</a> and very <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/health-consumers/news/tough-medicine-in-2024-for-irelands-struggling-healthcare-system/\">uneven access to healthcare</a>. Yet the results of Friday\u2019s vote have punctured the narrative of Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s inevitable rise to power on both sides of the Irish border. It was actually the biggest loser of the election, its share of the vote shrinking from a quarter to a fifth. The loss is disguised somewhat by the fact that there are more seats in an expanded D\u00e1il this time, but it is nonetheless undeniable.</p> <p>Why has Sinn F\u00e9in gone backwards? Partly because at least some of its support has leached away to rightwing candidates exploiting anti-immigrant sentiment among working-class voters who feel left behind by Ireland\u2019s shiny globalised economy. The far right did not make enough gains on Friday to win D\u00e1il seats, but its plethora of would-be tribunes of \u201cthe people\u201d did eat into parts of Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s traditional ethno-nationalist base.</p> <p>And partly because Sinn F\u00e9in has been beset in recent months by a series of internal scandals, some of them involving cover-ups of egregious failures of its child protection procedures. The party has looked at best incompetent and at worst cynical. For all its strengths, it has not looked ready for power in Dublin. Middle-class voters anxious for progressive change were drawn more towards the centre-left parties, Labour and the Social Democrats, both of whom performed very well, albeit from a low base.</p> <p>It is those parties who now face the most significant choices. Do they offer, in return for a share of power, to make up the numbers that Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael will require for a stable parliamentary majority? Or do they see an opportunity to exploit Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s difficulties and seek to establish themselves as the most dynamic force among the fragmented opposition?</p> <p>The attractions of office are strong, especially since the incoming government has plenty of money to spend. But Donald Trump\u2019s threat to start a trade war with the EU is especially ominous for Ireland, which depends heavily on its position as the European base for US companies. Almost every party that contested the election offered voters a bonanza of public spending on infrastructure, housing and public services. Expectations are correspondingly high. Yet there are good reasons to think that the fiscal luxury the last government enjoyed (and arguably squandered) may evaporate.</p> <p>There is also for the centre-left parties a political massacre to contemplate. The Green party that joined Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael in the outgoing government, and provided most of its innovation and dynamism, lost 11 of its 12 seats. To a degree it did so because its bigger partners signalled to voters that all the pain involved in trying to meet Ireland\u2019s obligations to tackle the climate crisis was the fault of the Greens. This was as disloyal as it was dishonest, and it showed the shallowness of the centre-right parties\u2019 commitment to genuine change and the ruthlessness with which they will devour their smaller allies.</p> <p>It may well be (depending on where the final seat numbers fall) that Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael will be able to govern with the support of a handful of independents. But such a government would have to confront the profound contradictions from which it has emerged. It would represent a dull continuity \u2013 even though the parties themselves promised, in the words of Fine Gael\u2019s election slogan, \u201ca new energy\u201d. Those who have been in government themselves recognised that the mood in the country is far from uniformly upbeat. Their basic proposition was that they can now do all the things \u2013 such as creating adequate physical infrastructure and public services \u2013 that they have failed to do previously, not just in the last four years but over the last century. It is a strangely familiar proposition.</p> <ul> <li><p>Fintan O\u2019Toole is a columnist with the Irish Times and the author of We Don\u2019t Know Ourselves: A Personal History of Modern Ireland</p></li> </ul>",

growth and greater protectionism against foreign competition under the new Trump administration in 2025.</p> <p>\u201cIn contrast, current production levels fell for a fourth straight month in November, dropping at a rate not exceeded for nearly one and a half years. The gap between expected future output and actual current output is now the widest seen for a decade if the pandemic is excluded, underscoring the marked divergence between tough current conditions and the mounting expectation of better times to come. </p> <p>Demand conditions need to improve alongside the improvement in confidence to encourage producers to raise production.

Over the last 12 months we\u2019ve seen a huge increase in new buyer volumes, viewings and offers made and there is a very healthy level of stock currently on the market.

      "bodyText": "Time to recap. Europe\u2019s manufacturers have suffered a slump in demand last month with \u201cno sign of a recovery\u201d. The latest poll of purchasing managers across Europe shows there was a faster decline in new factory orders, production, purchasing activity and inventories in November. There are also problems in UK manufacturing, where the PMI fell to a nine-month low. Workers at Volkswagen factories in Germany have held a \u2018warning strike\u2019, in protest at cutback plans. The euro has dropped by a cent, after French prime minister Michel Barnier decided to force the social security budget through the lower house of parliament without a final vote, triggering a no-confidence vote within days. Shares in carmaker Stellantis have slumped 7%, wiping over \u20ac2bn off its value, following the surprise departure of chief executive Carlos Tavares last night. Shares in Intel, though, are up over 3% after the retirement of CEO Pat Gelsinger was announced. Wealth manager St James\u2019s Place is cutting 500 jobs. House price inflation in the UK has accelerated, at the fastest rate in over two years. The Kremlin has argued that Donald Trump\u2019s threat to impose 100% tariffs on Brics economies, if they try to undermine the dollar, would backfire. The euro has lost more ground against the US dollar, after French prime minister Michel Barnier announced he would use special constitutional powers to force the social security budget through the lower house of parliament without a final vote. Barnier told lawmakers: \u201cWe are facing a moment of truth\u201d The use of article 49.3 of the French Constitution in this way must trigger a no-confidence vote, to be held within 48 hours\u2026 The euro has now lost a whole cent against the US dollar, to $1.0476. A new healthcheck on US manufacturing shows that the sector pretty much stabilised last month. Data provider S&amp;P Global reports that optimism at US factories rebounded last month, helped by a stabilising of new orders and a slowdown in rising costs. This lifted the US manufacturing PMI index up to 49.7 \u2013 close to stagnation \u2013 from 48.5 in October. Purchases of raw materials and parts from abroad may have been lifted by the threat of tariffs, with some US producers trying to front-run possible new trade costs. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, says: \u201cThe mood among US manufacturers brightened in November, though any feel-good factor has yet to feed through to higher output on the factory floor. \u201cOptimism about the year ahead has improved to a level not beaten in two and a half years, buoyed by the lifting of uncertainty seen in the lead up to the election, as well as the prospect of stronger economic growth and greater protectionism against foreign competition under the new Trump administration in 2025. \u201cIn contrast, current production levels fell for a fourth straight month in November, dropping at a rate not exceeded for nearly one and a half years. The gap between expected future output and actual current output is now the widest seen for a decade if the pandemic is excluded, underscoring the marked divergence between tough current conditions and the mounting expectation of better times to come. Demand conditions need to improve alongside the improvement in confidence to encourage producers to raise production. However, although export sales continue to fall sharply, we note that November\u2019s fall in overall new orders was the smallest seen over the past five months, hinting that the downturn in domestic demand for goods is easing and could help rev Intel\u2019s shares have jumped over 2% at the start of trading, following news of CEO Pat Gelsinger\u2019s departure (having dropped aroudn 60% while he was at the helm) Intel\u2019s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, is retiring, after three year stint trying to turn the struggling chip-maker around. Intel has annouecd that after \u201ca distinguished 40-plus-year career\u201d, Gelsinger stepped down from its board of directors yesterday. Frank Yeary, independent chair of the board of Intel, says: \u201cOn behalf of the board, I want to thank Pat for his many years of service and dedication to Intel across a long career in technology leadership. Pat spent his formative years at Intel, then returned at a critical time for the company in 2021. As a leader, Pat helped launch and revitalize process manufacturing by investing in state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing, while working tirelessly to drive innovation throughout the company.\u201d The chipmaker has appointed two interim co-chief executive officers \u2013 David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus \u2013 while a permanent successor is found. Gelsinger has returned to Intel in early 2021, pledging a turnaround plan under which the company would expand its foundry capacity and manufacture chips for anyone who wanted them. But Inte\u2019s share price has struggled on his watch. From around $50 in January 2021, it rose to $68 three months later, but has since dropped to arouns $24 today. He had earlier spent 30 years at Intel, becoming the company\u2019s first chief technology officer, and was the architect of its 80486 processor, which powered many PCs in the 1990s. Back in Paris, the stock market has shrugged off its earlier, small, losses, after the. France\u2019s government offered a final-hour concession on its 2025 budget. Prime Minister Michel Barnier committed to not cutting reimbursements for medicines, caving to yet another key demand from the far-right after crisis talks with Marine Le Pen this morning, Bloomberg reports. French bond prices have risen a little, pushing down the yield on the debt slightly. Volkswagen workers launched rolling two-hour strikes today at nine plants across Germany to underscore their resistance to pay cuts and factory closures the company says are necessary to cope with a slack European auto market. The work stoppages included the company\u2019s base plant at Wolfsburg, where workers rallied against a cost-cutting drive by the automaker\u2019s management in which they face the threat of the company\u2019s first plant closures in its home country. Chief employee representative Daniela Cavallo has said employees should not shoulder the burden of management failures to develop attractive products and come up with a cheaper, entry-level electric vehicle. Speaking at a rally in Wolfsburg as employees drummed, whistled and clapped, Cavallo said: \u201cWe demand that all make their contribution \u2013 management and the shareholder side as well.\u201d She said the next round of talks in a week\u2019s time \u201cis likely to set the course \u2013 rapprochement or escalation. We are ready for both.\u201d The so-called warning strikes, a common tactic in German wage negotiations, are taking place as part of talks for a new labor agreement after a mandatory peace period that bars strikes expired on Sunday. The IG Metall industrial union said any job actions beyond those occurring on Monday would be announced later. British wealth manager St James\u2019s Place is cut around 500 jobs in the coming months, Reuters reports. The cutbacks come as the sector faces intensifying competitive pressures, even as SJP prepares for a possible elevation back to the FTSE 100. Earlier this year, the company, which employs around 3,200 people, unveiled a cost-cutting plan to save \u00a3100m. A spokesperson for St James\u2019s Place says: \u201cOur cost reduction plans are focused on simplification and standardisation of processes within the business, but a programme of this size and scale will inevitably impact colleagues. \u201cWe have now begun consulting with colleagues to share our proposal for how this might impact roles, the outcome of which will not be known until next year.\u201d Most eurozone bond yields (interest rates) have dropped today, on fears that the region\u2019s economy is weakening. The slump in manufacturing output last month could put more pressure on the European Central Bank to cut interest rates. Thus, the yields on German, Spanish and Italian sovereign debt have all dropped, as their prices have risen. French bonds, though, are flat \u2013 which means that the \u2018risk-premium\u2019 between Paris and Berlin has swelled. Despite the troubles in the eurozone economy, unemployment in the bloc remains at a record low. Data provider eurostat reported this morning that the eurozone unemployment rate was 6.3% in October, stable compared with September, and down from 6.6% in October 2023 Moody\u2019s Analytics\u2019 senior economist Kamil Kovar, says \u201cOctober was yet another month when euro zone unemployment defied the skeptics, this time by confirming that the previous decline to 6.3% was not a fluke that will be reversed. Instead, the continued downward trend in the unemployment rate reflects structural declines in unemployment in Southern Europe that are dominating cyclical increases in Germany and elsewhere. We continue to believe that that the unemployment rate is more likely to tend lower, not higher, in coming quarters.\u201d There\u2019s a small dip on the French stock market today, due to the shake-up at Stellantis and political upheaval in Paris. The CAC 40 index has nudged down by 0.5% so far today, having dropped over 1% in early trading. Stellantis are the top faller, now down 7.3%, with financial stocks, utilities and real estate the worst-performing sectors. The ongoing row over the French budget is also worrying investors. Prime minister Michel Barnier is at risk of a no-confidence vote that could bring down his administration, as he struggles to win parliamentary backing for his 2025 budget plan, which includesa social security financing project that will be debated in the lower-house national assembly this afternoon. AFP newswire explain: If Barnier fails to find a parliamentary majority backing the measures, he is expected to use executive powers to adopt them without a vote, a procedure called \u201c49.3\u201d after the constitutional article detailing the prerogative. Such a move, however, would trigger a vote of no confidence that he could survive only if Le Pen\u2019s party abstains, with Barnier having little hope of finding any support from the left of centre. Over in Moscow, the Kremlin has suggested Donald Trump\u2019s push to force Brics countries to keep using the US dollar would backfire. Asked about Trump\u2019s threat to impose 100% tariffs on Brics members if they challenged the dollar, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the dollar was beginning to lose its appeal as a reserve currency for many countries. Peskov told reporters: \u201cMore and more countries are switching to the use of national currencies in their trade and foreign economic activities.\u201d If Washington resorted to \u201ceconomic force\u201d to compel countries to use the dollar it would backfire, Peskov predicted, adding: \u201cIf the U.S. uses force, as they say economic force, to compel countries to use the dollar it will further strengthen the trend of switching to national currencies (for international trade).\u201d Climate protesters gathered outside the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero in London this morning, to call for the end to government subsidies for the Drax Power Plant in North Yorkshire. Protestors from Axe Drax, Biofuelwatch, Climate Resistance, Fossil Free London, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and other members of the Stop Burning Trees Coalition donned Christmas jumpers and brought four giant Ents and a Christmas choir to the department. They presented the department with a Greenpeace petition calling for an end to the subsidies, signed by over 120,000 people. Drax\u2019s power station in North Yorkshire uses wood pellets to generate electricity; the protestors are unhappy that Drax is logging and sourcing wood from forests in British Columbia, and the Southern US, as well as burning waste wood. Paul Morozzo, a climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK, says: \u201cBurning trees to stop climate change is just as ridiculous as it sounds, subsidising Drax is a joke that\u2019s bad enough to go in a cracker, and all of the company\u2019s accounting tricks aren\u2019t making it any funnier. If we\u2019re going to hold back the climate disaster that\u2019s starting to have impacts all around the world then the government needs to stop subsidising high-cost, high-carbon energy like Drax, and concentrate on cleaner, cheaper, genuinely renewable sources. And just as importantly, we need governments and companies to stop accepting IOUs in place of real carbon cuts, because the climate crisis is here now.\u201d The drop in British manufacturing output comes as the CBI warns that business activity in the UK is on course to shrink for the first time in more than two years. The employers\u2019 body has reported that growth expectations among UK companies have taken \u201ca decisive turn for the worse\u201d: Thames Water has appointed a restructuring expert to its board to advise it as the British water company tries to raise more than \u00a36bn to avoid temporary nationalisation. The company said that Julian Gething has been appointed as chief restructuring officer and will sit on the boards of several companies within its complex corporate structure. Thames, which supplies water and sewage services to 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley, said that Gething would not be involved in anything operational, and his appointment would not herald any job cuts within the company. The British water industry has been under severe pressure for several years as many companies were caught out by rising interest rates, after years of underinvestment in crucial infrastructure. Thames has been the worst affected. Thames has won approval from its creditors to borrow \u00a33bn, before it tries to raise another \u00a33bn in equity investment to try to turn it around. The talks over the debts are likely to wipe out existing shareholders\u2019 stakes. Gething has worked for 35 years in restructuring, specialising in situations in which debtors must negotiate over losses. He is a partner at AlixPartners, a consultancy. Thames said that the appointment was supported by its lenders. Britain\u2019s manufacturing downturn has also worsened! The latest poll of purchasing managers at UK factories shows that output fell for the first time in seven months, driven by a fall in new orders. S&amp;P Global\u2019s PMI report also shows that firms cut back their staffing levels, purchasing activity and inventory holdings last month. Manufacturers found it harder to export; new orders from overseas contracted for the thirty-first month in a row, due to weaker demand from US, China, the EU and the Middle East. Some firms specifically mentioned weak demad from Germany, especially from its auto industry. Other companies suggested clients were rethinking their spending decisions following the UK budget at the end of October, which lifted taxes on businesses. There are also signs that supply chain pressures have risen, due to the Red Sea crisis, border regulatory issues (including Brexit related constraints) and the recent strike at US ports. This all pulled the UK manufacturing PMI down to 48.0 in November, from 49.9 in October, showing a contraction for the second month running. Rob Dobson, director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence says: \u201cConditions in the UK manufacturing sector deteriorated again in November. The headline PMI fell to a nine-month low as concerns surrounding the economic outlook, high costs and weak demand led to lower output, falling orders and cutbacks to purchasing, jobs and inventory holdings. The export climate also remained bleak, as weaker demand from the US, China and EU led to a further drop in new export business. While companies of all sizes are experiencing a downturn, small companies are the hardest hit, reporting especially marked drops in output, new orders and new export business. Meanwhile, supply chain worries have intensified as the combination of the Red Sea crisis, port disruptions and border regulation issues led to longer supplier delivery times, input shortages and rising costs. Input price inflation accelerated as a result. With recent budget announcements on labour costs and employer national insurance likely to raise costs further in 2025, and geopolitical tensions heating up notably around the threat of increased global protectionism, manufacturers are left facing an environment of high costs, low demand and raised uncertainty for the foreseeable future. News that the eurozone manufacturing recession has deepened came as Volkswagen workers across Germany began a walkout. The \u201cwarning strikes\u201d, which usually last a few hours, are a protest against VW\u2019s plans to lay off thousands of people, cut pay and close plants for the first time in its home country. Thorsten Gr\u00f6ger, the union IG Metall\u2019s lead negotiator with VW, said: \u201cIf need be, it will be the toughest collective bargaining battle Volkswagen has ever seen.\u201d The union leader accused VW managers of making the situation worse, adding: \u201cVolkswagen has set fire to our collective agreements.\u201d The eurozone\u2019s manufacturing recession has deepened, driven by a sharp slowdown in the region\u2019s largest economies. Data provider S&amp;P Global has reported that the euro area\u2019s manufacturing sector deteriorated at a faster pace during November. This wasa driven by quicker declines in new factory orders, production, purchasing activity and inventories. It pulled the HCOB eurozone manufacturing PMI down to a two-month low of 45.2, down from October\u2019s 46.0. Any reading below 50 shows a contraction. Among eurozone members, Germany recorded the fastest drop in output, Italy\u2019s factory sector shrank at the fastest rate in a year, while France recorded the steepest contraction in 10 months. Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, says: \u201cThese numbers look terrible. It\u2019s like the eurozone\u2019s manufacturing recession is never going to end. As new orders fell fast and at an accelerated pace, there\u2019s no sign of a recovery anytime soon. According to our nowcast, the manufacturing sector\u2019s output is going to decrease by 0.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the previous quarter. This slump is likely going to drag into next year. \u201cThe downturn is widespread, hitting all of the top three eurozone countries. Germany and France are faring the worst, and Italy is not doing much better. By main industrial grouping, it\u2019s the capital goods sector which is taking the biggest hit. In an interesting development, Spain\u2019s companies in the capital goods sector were able to show accelerated growth. This might be linked to the heavy floods in Spain, where an estimated 100,000 cars were destroyed and need to be replaced. But this boom most probably won\u2019t last. The report also found that companies continue to trim staffing levels, while firms continued to run down their inventories of materials and finished goods as they continued to destock. Stellantis\u2019s Milan-listed shares were just briefly halted from trading in Milan, Reuters, reports, after falling 7.99%. The pickup in house price growth last month is \u201cunlikely\u201d to have been driven by upcoming stamp duty changes, Nationwide argues, as the majority of mortgage applications commenced before the Budget announcement. Ouch. Stellantis\u2019s shares are now down 7.3% in Paris. Carlos Tavares\u2019s resignation comes two months after the departure of Stellantis\u2019s chief financial officer Natalie Knight. In a research note today, JP Morgan say: \u201cThis sets an unprecedented challenge for investors looking to invest in a firm with such volatility in the management team\u2026. With such a turnaround in the top management team, question marks may be raised as the market will in our view price in no major earnings improvement in FY25.\u201d Stellantis\u2019s shares are also down on the Milan stock exchange, where they\u2019ve lost 6.6% \u2013 after initially not trading when the market opened. Shares in car giant Stellantis have dropped at the start of trading, following the surprise resignation of CEO Carlos Tavares last night. Stellantis\u2019s shares are down 5.5% in Paris, as traders digest the shake-up at the company behind brands including Vauxhall, Fiat, Jeep and Peugeot. Last night, Stellantis announced that Tavaras would leave \u201cwith immedaite effect\u201d, and that the process to appointing the new permanent Chief Executive Officer was \u201cwell under way\u201d. Henri de Castries, Stellantis\u2019s senior independent director, hinted at boardroom tensions last night, saying: \u201cStellantis\u2019 success since its creation has been rooted in a perfect alignment between the reference shareholders, the Board and the CEO. However, in recent weeks different views have emerged which have resulted in the Board and the CEO coming to today\u2019s decision.\u201d Tavaras departure follows a decline in Stellantis\u2019s financial performance. At the end of October, the world\u2019s fourth-largest carmaker reported a steep fall in sales, which it blamed production delays and flagging demand in Europe. One person familiar with the situation told the Financial Times: \u201c[Tavares] was focusing on the short term rather than the group\u2019s longer term and managed to anger everybody in the process.\u201d Here\u2019s some reaction to this morning\u2019s Nationwide house price report: Guy Gittins, CEO of Foxtons: \u201cAfter the rate of house price growth slowed in the lead up to the Autumn Budget, the latest figures suggest the market is once again starting to accelerate. This consistent positivity demonstrates the current strength of the market despite the complications posed by wider economic headwinds. Over the last 12 months we\u2019ve seen a huge increase in new buyer volumes, viewings and offers made and there is a very healthy level of stock currently on the market. So, whilst house prices are climbing, there is certainly a good level of stock for buyers to choose from and the market isn\u2019t overheating due to the usual supply and demand imbalance. The market traditionally pauses for breath during the festive period, however, we\u2019re seeing a flurry of activity driven by buyers looking to secure stamp duty relief before next April\u2019s deadline. We anticipate the start of next year to be much the same, although those buyers who are looking to take advantage of current stamp duty relief thresholds need to be acting now to stand a chance of completing in time. Matt Thompson, head of sales at Chesterton: \u201cNovember\u2019s property market saw an increasing number of first-time buyers who were and still are motivated to purchase a property before the stamp duty changes in April 2025. This, in addition to high demand from house hunters in general, led to more sales being finalised than in November of last year. With the current level of buyer activity expected to continue well into the new year, we predict London properties to hold their value or see a gradual value increase of up to 3% over the course of next year.\u201d Tomer Aboody, director of specialist lender MT Finance: \u201cAnother month of house price growth further indicates the level of confidence in the market which has been evident since the reduction and stability in both mortgage rates and inflation. \u201cBoth sellers and buyers are pushing to transact, as affordability is improving. \u201cWhile the Budget is now behind us, its full impact has yet to be felt. However, we are hopeful that this confidence in the market continues, with further rate cuts expected in the new year.\u201d Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent: \u201cIn our offices we are seeing prices hardening and stock levels rising, partly because the Budget, though not particularly helpful, was not as bad as many feared either. \u201cAs a result, some pent-up demand was released and buyers are digging a little deeper. That extra choice, as well as broad acceptance that inflation and mortgage rates will not reduce as far and as fast as many expected, has meant caution still prevails. Transaction lengths are extending too, particularly bearing in mind the seasonal distractions so sellers still need to be extra competitive to attract serious attention at this time of year.\u201d The US dollar is rallying, after Donald Trump warned countries in the Brics bloc that he would impose 100% tariffs if they challenged America\u2019s currency. Over the weekend, Trump posted that he would impose 100% tariffs on Brics members if they create a new currency to rival the US dollar. The president-elect declared: We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy. With fears of a trade war rising, the dollar has gained 0.5% against a basket of major currencies \u2013 even though there\u2019s no agreement among Brics members to go it along with their own currency. This has pushed the pound down by half a cent to $1.2695. The euro, which is also weighed down by political instability in France, is also half a cent lower at $1.052. Trump\u2019s comments may be a sign that his administration will favour a stronger dollar. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank told clients this morning As ever with Mr Trump it seems to be a shot across the bows but likely wouldn\u2019t ultimately be great for the US economy if implemented\u2026. it seems to further point to Dollar strength being a theme of the new administration as against Trump 1.0 where initially they tried to talk the Dollar down. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. UK house prices growth has \u201csurprisingly\u201d picked up to a two-year high, a new survey this morning shows, despite the recent rise in mortgage rates. The average prices of a house sold in November rose by 1.2% compared with October, lender Nationwide reports, to \u00a3268,144. That\u2019s the largest monthly gain since March 20. That lifts the annual increase in house prices to 3.7% \u2013 the fastest since November 2022, shortly after Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget - up from 2.4% in October. House prices are just 1% below the all-time high recorded in the summer of 2022. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, says the pace of the increase is unexpected: \u201cThe acceleration in house price growth is surprising, since affordability remains stretched by historic standards, with house prices still high relative to average incomes and interest rates well above pre-Covid levels. Housing market activity has remained \u201crelatively resilient in recent months\u201d, Gardner adds, with mortgage approvals approaching the levels seen before the Covid-19 pandemic. Gardner adds: \u201cSolid labour market conditions, with low levels of unemployment and strong income gains, even after taking account of inflation, have helped underpin a steady rise in activity and house prices since the start of the year. Household balance sheets are also in good shape with debt levels at their lowest levels relative to household income since the mid-2000s. Nationwide also predicts there will be a jump in transactions in the first three months of 2025. as buyers try to seal deals before changes to stamp duty kick in next April. These surveys from lenders can\u2019t give a perfect measure of the market though; they only track buyers taking out a mortgage, rather than cash buyers. And changes in the \u2018mix\u2019 of houses being sold can also distort the data.

      "bodyText": "Lucy Letby\u2019s parents wrote to hospital bosses expressing their \u201cintolerable anguish\u201d after police began investigating their daughter, and asking for an urgent meeting with senior managers, a public inquiry has heard. Two months after officers from Cheshire constabulary were brought into the hospital to investigate an increase in the number of baby deaths on the neonatal ward in 2015 and 2016, John and Susan Letby wrote to the Countess of Chester hospital\u2019s then board chair, Sir Duncan Nichol. \u201cIt is now one year since our nightmare began,\u201d they wrote in an email. \u201cThere is a saying \u2018innocent until proven guilty\u2019 but it doesn\u2019t seem to apply to Lucy. \u201cShe is still the only one of all the staff on the neonatal unit to be singled out for punishment.\u201d Requesting an \u201curgent meeting\u201d to discuss matters, they added: \u201cWe would appreciate the meeting to be as soon as possible as the anguish this situation is causing has become intolerable.\u201d Nichol told the Thirlwall inquiry, sitting at Liverpool town hall and looking into the events surrounding Letby\u2019s crimes, that he did not respond to the email sent on 7 July 2017, which was also sent to the then chief executive, Tony Chambers. Letby, a former neonatal nurse who has been convicted of murdering seven infants and attempting to murder seven others, with two attempts on one of her victims, was moved from the unit in July 2016. She was placed in an administrative role in the risk and patient safety department, after consultant paediatricians voiced fears she may have deliberately harmed babies under her care. Letby was said to have believed that two consultants, Dr Stephen Brearey and Dr Ravi Jayaram, had \u201corchestrated a campaign\u201d against her and that some doctors on the unit referred to her publicly as \u201cangel of death\u201d. Last week, the inquiry heard that Letby\u2019s father called for the \u201cinstant dismissal\u201d of the two consultants when he and his wife, together with Lucy Letby, met Chambers at the hospital in December 2016. Giving evidence, Chambers said Letby\u2019s father was \u201cvery angry\u201d and was \u201cthreatening guns to my head and all sorts of things\u201d. In another meeting, Chambers was noted to have told the nurse: \u201cLucy, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve got your back,\u201d but he explained to the inquiry that he wanted to try to avoid further escalation, \u201cparticularly from her father\u201d. Letby, 34, from Hereford, was sentenced to 15 whole-life orders after she was convicted of the murders and attempted murders between June 2015 and June 2016 at Manchester crown court. The public inquiry is expected to sit until early 2025, with the findings published by late autumn next year.",

Along with ammunition and missiles, thousands of North Korean soldiers have been fighting in Russia\u2019s <strong>Kursk</strong> region to expel Ukrainian forces there, according to the Kyiv Independent.

Despite Trump\u2019s tendency towards hyperbolic rhetoric, he said people should take the threat of Nato withdrawal \u201cvery seriously\u201d. Bolton told Sky News:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>He basically thinks we are defending Europe, we don\u2019t get anything out of it. They are not paying anything. What is in it for us? It s the same view he has with our alliances with South Korea and with Japan.

I think the US is going to have to increase its defence spending to something close to Reagan era level (4/5%). That means Europe is going to have to go up to 3%.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Burley put two of Trump\u2019s claims to Bolton: that there were no high profile wars during his presidency between 2016 and 2020 and that he could end the Ukraine war within 24 hours when he enters office again next month. He agreed, broadly, that there were no \u201chigh profile wars\u201d, though he said he dealt with the Afghanistan war \u201cincorrectly\u201d by making a deal with the Taliban, which Bolton said was implemented \u201cdisastrously\u201d by Joe Biden, the outgoing US president. </p> <p>\u201cTrump is exaggerating. He is telling the truth in the sense that we were in a calmer period of history and we have see now what can happen, in part because of the weakness demonstrated by Biden in withdrawing from Afghanistan and failing to even try to deter the Russians before they invaded Ukraine,\u201d Bolton told Sky News.</p> <p>Looking at what Trump could do in office, Bolton, who was Trump\u2019s national security adviser from April 2018 to September 2019, added: \u201cHe has said he will get Zelenskyy and Putin in a room together and they would solve Ukraine in 24 hours \u2013 good luck with that.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVuQXDuQzNU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fVuQXDuQzNU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Former US national security adviser John Bolton has been interviewed by Sky News\u2019 Kay Burley</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Bolton served in the Reagan, George W Bush and first Trump administrations.

We understand that the technology with which they were manufactured is outdated,\u201d Andrii Cherniak, a military intelligence spokesperson, said, answering questions about the likelihood of Russia\u2019s use of KN-23 ballistic missiles. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has been in Kyiv for an unannounced visit that marks his first trip to Ukraine since the early months of full-scale war in the summer of 2022. Scholz, who met with Volodymy Zelenskyy during the visit, used the trip to announce further equipment deliveries worth \u20ac650m (\u00a3540m) to be delivered this month. The package includes IRIS-T air defence systems, Leopard 1 tanks and armed drones, a defence ministry spokesperson said. Zelenskyy wrote on X: \u201cWe are deeply grateful to Germany for all the assistance it has provided. Germany stands as a European leader in supporting Ukraine, helping us defend ourselves against Russian aggression and terror.\u201d The US is preparing to send Ukraine an additional $725m in military assistance, including counter-drone systems and munitions for its high mobility artillery rocket system, which could indicate more of the longer-range missiles are headed to the battlefield, the Associated Press reported. Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, warned her Chinese counterpart that Beijing\u2019s support for Moscow would impact ties and instead urged China to help end the war in Ukraine. \u201cThe Russian president is not only destroying our European peace order through his war against Ukraine, but is now dragging Asia into it via North Korea,\u201d she told a press briefing. \u201cMy Chinese counterpart and I have therefore discussed in depth that this cannot be in China\u2019s interest either.\u201d Valentina Matviyenko, the speaker of Russia\u2019s upper legislative house, said she expects Russian-Ukrainian peace talks next year.

Thanks for following along. You can read all our Ukraine coverage here. We have some comments from Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has met with his German counterpart, Olaf Scholz, today in Kyiv. You can read more about the trip here. Speaking to journalists, he said that strong weapons and diplomacy were required to ensure peace, as he urged Germany not to end its support to his country. \u201cWe can only ensure peace through strength, the strength of our weapons, our diplomacy, and our cooperation,\u201d Zelenskyy told a press briefing, alongside Scholz. He added: \u201cIt is fundamental for us that Germany as a leader does not reduce (support) next year, including financial support.\u201d Germany is to hold an election in February in which Scholz faces a mounting right wing challenge. Scholz has been criticised both by politicians who want Germany to stop sending weapons to Ukraine, and by those who want him to take more bold action, including sending long-range Taurus missiles to Kyiv, which he has so far refused to do. The Kremlin has said that preparations were under way for Vladimir Putin to visit India but no exact dates were given. The Russian president is likely to visit India in early 2025 at the invitation of his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, Indian broadcaster CNN-News18 reported earlier. Modi visited Kyiv in August and Moscow in July in an effort to encourage talks, casting Delhi as a potential peacemaker, but there have been few developments since. During the Russia visit in July, Putin embraced the Indian leader at his home at Novo-Ogaryovo, greeted him as his \u201cdear friend\u201d and said he was \u201cvery happy\u201d to see him. Referencing the visit, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on X that it undermined peace efforts to see Modi hug \u201cthe world\u2019s most bloody criminal\u201d on the same day so many civilians were killed across Ukraine by Russian airstrikes. Russia remains one of India\u2019s most important trading partners, particularly on weapons and defence. Russia is a vital supplier of cut-price oil and weapons to India, but Moscow\u2019s isolation from the west and growing ties with Beijing have affected its partnership with New Delhi. You can read more about the countries\u2019 relationship here. We are leading today\u2019s blog with Germany\u2019s foreign minster saying that Vladimir Putin is \u201cdragging Asia\u201d into the conflict by North Korea deploying thousands of troops to fight for Russia against Ukraine. Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, has not denied the deployment of North Korean troops to his country but has also refused to confirm it. According to US intelligence, at least 10,000 North Korean soldiers have arrived in Russia, a figure that Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence chief says includes 500 officers and three generals. North Korea has pledged to support Moscow until it achieves a \u201cgreat victory\u201d in Ukraine, as my colleagues Luke Harding and Alessio Mamo write in this story about Pyongyang\u2019s involvement in the war. A Ukrainian military spokesperson told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty today that Russia has fired at least 60 North Korean-supplied ballistic missiles during the war, launched by Moscow in February 2022. \u201cTheir accuracy, in principle, is not very high. We understand that the technology with which they were manufactured is outdated,\u201d Andrii Cherniak, a military intelligence spokesperson, said, answering questions about the likelihood of Russia\u2019s use of KN-23 ballistic missiles. Along with ammunition and missiles, thousands of North Korean soldiers have been fighting in Russia\u2019s Kursk region to expel Ukrainian forces there, according to the Kyiv Independent. Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into the Kursk region in August, but has since lost more than 40% of the territory it had captured as Russian forces have mounted waves of counter-assaults. Norway\u2019s defence ministry has said it will provide F-35 fighter jets and Nasams (National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System) air defence systems to a logistics hub in Poland. Early this month, Norway will assume air defence responsibility for a key hub for the transport of civilian and military material from other countries to Ukraine, the ministry said in a press release. \u201cThis way, Norway contributes to ensuring that aid to Ukraine reaches its destination, allowing Ukraine to continue its fight for freedom\u2019, the country\u2019s defence minister, Bj\u00f8rn Arild Gram, said. The defence ministry also said that Norway will \u201csafeguard\u201d the airspace above the airport in Rzesz\u00f3w, Poland, and will send about 100 soldiers in addition to the air defence systems and fighter jets. Gram said: Poland is making a tremendous effort to ensure that both civilian and military supplies reach Ukraine. The airport is also central to the medical evacuation efforts that Norway is responsible for. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine have demonstrated the value of air defence, and the Norwegian contribution in Poland is highly appreciated. We are doing this primarily for Ukraine and Poland, but it also shows that we stand by our commitments within Nato. More now on the military aid due to be delivered to Ukraine this month - as announced to coincide with German chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s visit today. The weaponry includes IRIS-T air defence systems, Leopard 1 tanks and armed drones, a defence ministry spokesperson said on Monday. \u201cWinter is just around the corner, so there will also be winter equipment, as well as hand-held weapons and warming devices,\u201d the spokesperson said just hours after Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced the deliveries during a surprise trip to Kyiv. The spokesperson added the deliveries were part of a military aid package already announced by Berlin in October. Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted a closer look at the weapons on X, adding, \u201cit is crucial that Ukraine produces such weapons in cooperation with Germany.\u201d Security guarantees will be key to Ukraine healing its shattered economy if Donald Trump moves to negotiate an end to the war with Russia when he returns to the White House, according to the chief executive of one of the country\u2019s largest companies. Yuriy Ryzhenkov, the chief executive of the steel company Metinvest, said the company\u2019s economy could grow like Germany\u2019s economic miracle after the devastation of the second world war if the right policies are in place - but added there was a high degree of uncertainty over Trump\u2019s plans. Trump has promised to end the Ukraine war in \u201cone day\u201d, but has given little indication of how he plans to do so once he takes power again in January. His pick as US envoy to Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, has proposed withdrawing US weaponry from Ukraine if it does not enter peace talks Full story below Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has heaped praise on Germany for supporting Kyiv\u2019s war effort as Olaf scholz paid a visit to injured troops earlier today. In a post on X he wrote: \u201cToday, Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz is in Ukraine, marking the first bilateral visit by a German Chancellor in more than two years. \u201cWe are deeply grateful to Germany for all the assistance it has provided. Germany stands as a European leader in supporting Ukraine, helping us defend ourselves against Russian aggression and terror. \u201cOur meeting with (Olaf Scholz began with a visit to our warriors, wounded in combat against the occupiers, who are currently undergoing treatment and rehabilitation. \u201cTogether, we are doing everything to restore a just peace for Ukraine\u2014and therefore security for all of Europe\u2014as soon as possible.\u201d Hungary needs to strengthen its \u201cpeace mission\u201d now when there is a risk of escalation of the war in Ukraine, Hungary\u2019s foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, said in Moscow earlier today before he headed to talks with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. \u201cThe past 1000 days prove that there is no solution to this conflict on the battlefield,\u201d Szijjarto said in a live video on his Facebook page, reiterating Hungary\u2019s stance. Szijjarto has met Lavrov several times since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, one of Europe\u2019s most pro-Russian leaders, has said recently that the EU needs to rethink its support for Ukraine following Donald Trump\u2019s US election victory, adding that Europe cannot finance the war alone. In contrast to most European nations, Hungary has repeatedly questioned the need to support Ukraine militarily, and has instead called for a ceasefire. Valentina Matviyenko, the speaker of Russia\u2019s upper legislative house, has said she expects Russian-Ukrainian peace talks next year. In an interview with the pro-Kremlin newspaper Argumenty i Fakty, she said: I will express my purely personal opinion. I believe that the probability that there will be a real attempt to start such negotiations and meetings in 2025 is significantly higher than the probability that such attempts will not be made. This, I repeat, is my personal forecast. What will happen next \u2013 we will see. Matviyenko added, however, that the \u201cserious escalation\u201d undertaken by the outgoing Biden administration will \u201cmost likely affect potential negotiations\u201d, referring to Washington granting Kyiv permission to use long-range missiles inside Russia. Russia is reportedly open to discussing a Ukraine ceasefire deal with Donald Trump but rules out making any major territorial concessions and insists Kyiv abandon ambitions to join Nato. Russia continues to demand \u201cdemilitarisation and denazification\u201d of Ukraine, and in previous peace negotiations said Kyiv\u2019s military should be reduced to 50,000, as my colleague Dan Sabbagh notes in this story. It also claims the territory of four eastern and southern Ukrainian provinces, Donetsk, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Luhansk, of which only the fourth is fully occupied. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has insisted that Ukraine needs security guarantees from Nato and more weapons to defend itself before entering any negotiations with Moscow. He has appeared to shift his position by seeming to now concede that Ukraine may have to \u201ctemporarily\u201d give up some territory to end the war, which could be negotiated back diplomatically at a future point. Ukraine wants an immediate invitation to join Nato, with membership later, but this is widely seen as unrealistic. Officials said today that Russian attacks against Ukraine have killed at least four people and injured 23 across multiple regions. Here is a report, summarising the attacks, from the Kyiv Independent: Russian forces launched 110 Shahed-type drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles against Ukraine overnight, the air force said. Fifty-two were shot down, 50 were lost across Ukraine thanks to electronic warfare countermeasures, and six flew to Belarus and Russia, according to the statement. A Russian drone hit an apartment building in the western city of Ternopil, killing at least one person and injuring four, officials said. About 100 people were evacuated from the damaged building. The blast also damaged windows of the surrounding buildings, a school, and 20 cars. In Dnipropetrovsk oblast, a 60-year-old man was injured during Russian attacks against Nikopol and the Marhanets community, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. Russian attacks against Donetsk oblast injured five people, governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Two injuries were reported in the town of Pokrovsk, two in the village of Shevchenko, and one in the Andriivka village. In Kherson oblast, three people were killed and 13 injured in Russian attacks over the past day, governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. The three fatalities and 11 injuries were reported after Russian forces struck a minibus in the city of Kherson on 1 December. Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Chernivtsi, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Luhansk, Poltava, Zhytomyr, Mykolaiv, Sumy, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts also came under attack but no casualties were reported. Donald Trump\u2019s former national security adviser John Bolton has been interviewed by Sky News\u2019 Kay Burley. Bolton said Trump \u201cdistrusts\u201d Nato and does not understand the principle of a defensive alliance. Despite Trump\u2019s tendency towards hyperbolic rhetoric, he said people should take the threat of Nato withdrawal \u201cvery seriously\u201d. Bolton told Sky News: He basically thinks we are defending Europe, we don\u2019t get anything out of it. They are not paying anything. What is in it for us? It s the same view he has with our alliances with South Korea and with Japan. I am very worried about it. Now Europeans and many others say \u2018but we are close to paying 2% of our GDP on defence \u2013 which we pledged, by the way, ten years ago at a Nato summit\u2019 and which many have still not reached. I think the US is going to have to increase its defence spending to something close to Reagan era level (4/5%). That means Europe is going to have to go up to 3%. Burley put two of Trump\u2019s claims to Bolton: that there were no high profile wars during his presidency between 2016 and 2020 and that he could end the Ukraine war within 24 hours when he enters office again next month. He agreed, broadly, that there were no \u201chigh profile wars\u201d, though he said he dealt with the Afghanistan war \u201cincorrectly\u201d by making a deal with the Taliban, which Bolton said was implemented \u201cdisastrously\u201d by Joe Biden, the outgoing US president. \u201cTrump is exaggerating. He is telling the truth in the sense that we were in a calmer period of history and we have see now what can happen, in part because of the weakness demonstrated by Biden in withdrawing from Afghanistan and failing to even try to deter the Russians before they invaded Ukraine,\u201d Bolton told Sky News. Looking at what Trump could do in office, Bolton, who was Trump\u2019s national security adviser from April 2018 to September 2019, added: \u201cHe has said he will get Zelenskyy and Putin in a room together and they would solve Ukraine in 24 hours \u2013 good luck with that.\u201d Bolton served in the Reagan, George W Bush and first Trump administrations. After his firing in 2019, Bolton published a book, The Room Where It Happened, in which he strongly criticised Trump\u2019s leadership. Earlier this year, Bolton called Trump\u2019s 2024 presidential bid \u201cpoison\u201d to the Republican party. Known for his hawkish views, Bolton has previously advocated bombing North Korea and wielding military might elsewhere to further American interests rather than get bogged down in multilateral agreements. Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, has warned her Chinese counterpart that Beijing\u2019s support for Moscow would impact ties and instead urged China to help end the war in Ukraine Speaking in Beijing, she said the over 1,000-day war was affecting the whole world and North Korean troops being deployed to fight for Russia in Ukraine and the use of Chinese-made drones. According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), Baerbock urged an international peace process for Ukraine and said \u201cthat is why I am here in China today\u201d, adding that every permanent member of the UN security council had a \u201cresponsibility for peace and security in the world\u201d \u201cThe Russian president is not only destroying our European peace order through his war against Ukraine, but is now dragging Asia into it via North Korea,\u201d she told a press briefing. \u201cMy Chinese counterpart and I have therefore discussed in depth that this cannot be in China\u2019s interest either. She met with China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, for a \u201cstrategic dialogue\u201d as Berlin seeks to build better ties with China while engaging on key differences. China presents itself as a neutral party in the Ukraine war and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the US and other western countries. But it remains a close political and economic ally of Russia, and Nato members have said Beijing is a \u201cdecisive enabler\u201d of the war, which it has never condemned. \u201cDrones from Chinese factories and North Korean troops attacking the peace in the middle of Europe are violating our core European security interests,\u201d Baerbock said. Here are some pictures from German chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s surprise visit to Kyiv today: Georgian police have arrested a prominent opposition leader after using water cannon and teargas to scatter anti-government protesters who rallied outside parliament for a fourth consecutive night. The protests were sparked by the government\u2019s announcement last week that it was suspending talks on joining the EU. Critics saw that as confirmation of a Russian-influenced shift away from pro-western policies, something the ruling party denies. The Coalition for Change, the country\u2019s largest opposition party, said in a post on X that Zurab Japaridze, one of its leaders, was arrested by police early on Monday as he was leaving the demonstration. Moscow denies interfering in its neighbour, but a former Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, warned on Sunday that Georgia was \u201cmoving rapidly along the Ukrainian path, into the dark abyss\u201d, adding: \u201cUsually this sort of thing ends very badly.\u201d You can read more on this developing story here: The Kremlin has responded to the news that the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is in Kyiv in a show of support for Ukraine. In a regular press briefing to journalists, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow had no \u201cexpectations\u201d from the visit by Scholz, who spoke by phone to Vladimir Putin last month in a controversial phone call. \u201cI would not say we have expectations from this visit. Germany is continuing its line of unconditional support to Ukraine,\u201d Peskov said, adding that Putin had not passed on a message to Volodymyr Zelenskyy through Scholz. As we reported in the opening post, a Russian drone hit a residential building in the western city of Ternopil, killing at least one person and injuring several others, officials said on Monday. Ternopil \u2013 a city with a population of about 225,000 \u2013 is far from the frontline and is not commonly targeted by Russian forces. Serhiy Nadal, the head of the regional defence headquarters in Ternopil, said via Telegram that as result of the attack, a fire engulfed several flats on the top floor of a five-storey apartment building. He said that residents from several apartments were evacuated and that emergency services were working at the scene. About 20 cars were reported to have been damaged in the yard of the building. Social media videos showed flames bursting out of the windows of a multi-storey apartment building in the darkness. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has suggested that retaking parts of Ukrainian territory may have to be achieved through diplomatic means, rather than military force. In an interview with the Japanese news agency, Kyodo News, Zelenskyy said it is difficult to reclaim some of the Russian occupied parts of his country by force, including the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, as things stand. \u201cOur army lacks the strength to do that. That is true,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cWe do have to find diplomatic solutions.\u201d He stressed that such steps could be considered \u201conly when we know that we are strong enough\u201d to prevent Russia from launching new aggression against Ukraine. Zelenskyy\u2019s comments indicate a shift away from his long-held stance that his country will fight to regain all territory seized by Russia. Zelenskyy has called on the outgoing Biden administration to help convince Nato members to invite Ukraine to join the alliance, as Russia continues to make battlefield gains. He said the conflict has entered a \u201ccomplicated period\u201d. In October, he revealed a so-called victory plan, which contains a step that some crucial western allies have so far refused to countenance: inviting Ukraine to join Nato before the war ends. As we mentioned in the opening summary, Olaf Scholz held an hour-long call with Vladimir Putin on 15 November, angering Kyiv as it was seen to weaken Europe\u2019s attempt to isolate the Russian president. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said it opened a \u201cPandora\u2019s box\u201d that undermined efforts to end the war in Ukraine with \u201ca fair peace\u201d. Scholz defended the call with Putin, their first direct communication in almost two years, saying it was important to tell him he cannot count on German support for Ukraine to wane. Scholz reportedly condemned Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and called on Moscow to negotiate with Kyiv to come to a \u201cfair and lasting peace\u201d. He also criticised Russia\u2019s deployment of North Korean troops against Ukraine, describing it as a \u201cgrave escalation\u201d of the conflict (according to US, South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments, up to 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia as part of a major defence treaty between Russia and North Korea). Scholz\u2019s willingness to engage with Putin is likely to provoke frustration in Ukraine, whose future became uncertain after Donald Trump\u2019s victory, as American military aid may be reduced during his presidency. As the second biggest backer of Ukraine after the US, Germany faces concerns that it will be left to take on a far bigger share of the war effort if Trump carries out his threat to reduce support for Kyiv, my colleagues Pjotr Sauer and Kate Connolly note in this story. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, visited Ukraine for the first time in more than two and a half years on Monday. The diplomatic trip comes just weeks after he was criticised by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for having a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Their call came at a time of widespread speculation about what the new administration of president-elect Donald Trump will mean for Ukraine. Scholz, who is under pressure from many voters to cut aid to Kyiv, said that, in his meeting with Zelenskyy, he will announce further military supplies this month totalling \u20ac650m (\u00a3539m). Zelenskyy is set to push Nato to invite Ukraine to join the military alliance at a meeting in Brussels this week. \u201cUkraine can rely on Germany \u2013 we say what we do and we do what we say,\u201d the German chancellor said. Scholz has been cautious about talk of fast-tracking Nato membership for Ukraine. In recent months, he has emphasised the importance of finding a path to peace, while stressing that it must not be chosen over Ukraine\u2019s head. In other developments: At least one person was killed and others injured in a Russian attack on Ternopil in western Ukraine, reports said on Monday morning. The city mayor, Serhiy Nadal, said a drone hit the fifth floor of an apartment building, starting a fire. Ukraine\u2019s air force said on Monday that Russia launched 110 drone attacks the previous night. The air force shot down 52 while 50 were \u201clost\u201d, likely due to electronic warfare, it said. One remained in Ukrainian airspace and six headed toward Belarus and Russia. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday that his country needed security guarantees from Nato and more weapons to defend itself before any talks with Russia. He called for \u201csteps forward with Nato\u201d and a \u201cgood number\u201d of long-distance weapons for Ukraine to defend itself. \u201cOnly when we have all these items and we are strong, after that, we have to make the very important \u2026 agenda of meeting with one or another of the killers,\u201d he said, adding that the EU and Nato should be involved in any negotiations. Zelenskyy made the comments after meeting the EU\u2019s new foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, and the EU council chief, Antonio Costa, who were visiting Kyiv as a show of support on their first day in office. Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, on Monday warned her Chinese counterpart that Beijing\u2019s support for Russia would \u201cimpact\u201d ties. \u201cForeign minister Baerbock emphasised that the increasing Chinese support for Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine has an impact on our relations, as core German and European security interests are affected,\u201d according to a German foreign ministry spokesperson.",

Where it becomes important for the drivers and for all of us is: how does it make the decision making process better? Is the sport improving because of these changes? And if the answer to this is yes, it is an internal matter he has to handle. \u201cObviously what\u2019s in the news and the potential spillover in terms of negativity and reputation is something that is bad for all of us.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Perhaps the most extraordinary aspect of Sunday afternoon at Anfield was how ordinary it all felt. Everybody came for something apocalyptic and what they got was a league game that felt like pretty much any other league game in which Liverpool beat a side who aren\u2019t as good as them. For a time there was a thought that Liverpool might pay for failing to take advantage of their early domination, for missing decent chances. But Manchester City are no longer the almost supernatural force they once were; eventually they made two mistakes in quick succession, giving away first possession and then a penalty, and the game was Liverpool\u2019s.</p> \n<p>Even Pep Guardiola seems to have accepted it is over. After the \u2013 frankly uncomfortable \u2013 sight of him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/27/ilkay-gundogan-describes-manchester-citys-miserable-form-as-inexplicable\">clawing at his own scalp</a> on Tuesday as they tossed away a three-goal lead against Feyenoord, he responded to chants of \u201cYou\u2019re getting sacked in the morning\u201d by grinning and raising six fingers to denote the number of Premier League titles he has won. Unfortunately, it also denotes how many of their last seven games City have lost.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/02/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action\">Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend\u2019s action</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>All of which raises two questions. Firstly, can anybody stop Liverpool, who have won 18 games in 20 games under Arne Slot? And secondly, in what circumstances might Guardiola actually be sacked?</p> \n<p>So far, Slot has a habit of playing teams just as they hit a slump in form. It\u2019s not to diminish what he has achieved at Anfield to point out that he\u2019s also been a lucky manager. But equally, a lot of the reason Liverpool\u2019s opponents have not been at their best is that they\u2019ve been playing Liverpool, who seem to have found a very happy middle ground in which they have many of the qualities of J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s sides without some of the recklessness.</p> \n<p>Few managers have left a club in quite as good a state as Klopp did. Most depart when the structure is broken, but Klopp had begun the process of rebuilding, reshaping his forward line and midfield over his last couple of seasons. Slot, it should not be forgotten, has done this without adding a single player; which, as Trent Alexander-Arnold, Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah approach the end of their contracts, may by next season have become problematic. Yet he did not leave a side that had been so successful recently that the path led inevitably downwards. After four successive City titles, there has been no reason for anybody at Liverpool to be resistant to change. Slot has played the political game well, always paying appropriate deference to Klopp while tweaking to make Liverpool play a slightly more conservative style.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"365bd2cd-88f4-4a5b-bd42-ef3392ff8d5f\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian\u2019s Jonathan Wilson has been named as writer of the year at the 2024 Football Supporters\u2019 Association awards. It marks the fourth time he has won, following up from 2012, 2017 and 2021.</p>\n    <p>The fan-led FSA awards, which have existed in their current format since 2011, attract around half a million votes from supporters around the UK.</p>\n    <p>The Wrexham-centric Fearless In Devotion won podcast of the year. Not The Top 20, which covers the Football League, won the fan media of the year award for the first time, while Ellis Platten\u2019s Away Days became the first YouTube channel to win social media of the year.</p>\n    <p>Wycombe midfielder David Wheeler, the PFA\u2019s sustainability champion, took away the climate action award, Bournemouth\u2019s Hannah Powis was recognised as supporter liaison officer of the year, while Portsmouth won for supporter engagement. <b>Guardian sport</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>At the same time, there have been repeated occasions this season when he has made changes that have had a clear positive effect. Almost the default pattern for a Liverpool match has been a slightly featureless first half followed by a second in which they score a couple of goals. Against Ipswich, Wolves, Chelsea, Arsenal, Brighton, Bayer Leverkusen, Southampton and Real Madrid, Liverpool improved after Slot\u2019s in-game tinkering. That is a hugely impressive hit rate, and suggests a manager not merely extremely adept at reading the game tactically but decisive in acting upon that.</p> \n<p>Liverpool\u2019s lead over Chelsea and Arsenal is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague/table\">nine points with 25 games to go</a>.

      "bodyText": "Perhaps the most extraordinary aspect of Sunday afternoon at Anfield was how ordinary it all felt. Everybody came for something apocalyptic and what they got was a league game that felt like pretty much any other league game in which Liverpool beat a side who aren\u2019t as good as them. For a time there was a thought that Liverpool might pay for failing to take advantage of their early domination, for missing decent chances. But Manchester City are no longer the almost supernatural force they once were; eventually they made two mistakes in quick succession, giving away first possession and then a penalty, and the game was Liverpool\u2019s. Even Pep Guardiola seems to have accepted it is over. After the \u2013 frankly uncomfortable \u2013 sight of him clawing at his own scalp on Tuesday as they tossed away a three-goal lead against Feyenoord, he responded to chants of \u201cYou\u2019re getting sacked in the morning\u201d by grinning and raising six fingers to denote the number of Premier League titles he has won. Unfortunately, it also denotes how many of their last seven games City have lost. All of which raises two questions. Firstly, can anybody stop Liverpool, who have won 18 games in 20 games under Arne Slot? And secondly, in what circumstances might Guardiola actually be sacked? So far, Slot has a habit of playing teams just as they hit a slump in form. It\u2019s not to diminish what he has achieved at Anfield to point out that he\u2019s also been a lucky manager. But equally, a lot of the reason Liverpool\u2019s opponents have not been at their best is that they\u2019ve been playing Liverpool, who seem to have found a very happy middle ground in which they have many of the qualities of J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s sides without some of the recklessness. Few managers have left a club in quite as good a state as Klopp did. Most depart when the structure is broken, but Klopp had begun the process of rebuilding, reshaping his forward line and midfield over his last couple of seasons. Slot, it should not be forgotten, has done this without adding a single player; which, as Trent Alexander-Arnold, Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah approach the end of their contracts, may by next season have become problematic. Yet he did not leave a side that had been so successful recently that the path led inevitably downwards. After four successive City titles, there has been no reason for anybody at Liverpool to be resistant to change. Slot has played the political game well, always paying appropriate deference to Klopp while tweaking to make Liverpool play a slightly more conservative style. At the same time, there have been repeated occasions this season when he has made changes that have had a clear positive effect. Almost the default pattern for a Liverpool match has been a slightly featureless first half followed by a second in which they score a couple of goals. Against Ipswich, Wolves, Chelsea, Arsenal, Brighton, Bayer Leverkusen, Southampton and Real Madrid, Liverpool improved after Slot\u2019s in-game tinkering. That is a hugely impressive hit rate, and suggests a manager not merely extremely adept at reading the game tactically but decisive in acting upon that. Liverpool\u2019s lead over Chelsea and Arsenal is nine points with 25 games to go. It would be too early to say the race is over, even if we knew how they handle life when fortune turns on them, but that is an extremely healthy advantage, particularly given there is no reason to expect either Chelsea or Arsenal suddenly to embark on a remorseless winning spree \u2013 although Arsenal have already played their away games against five of the other six teams who finished in the top seven last season. And could Guardiola be sacked? It seems unthinkable. For most of the past 16 years he has been obviously the best coach in the world. Long before he got to City, the club was built to his vision. To break from that would be a seismic act for the club\u2019s owners, far greater than, say, Leicester offloading Claudio Ranieri or Chelsea dismissing Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in the months after they won a title, especially as City fight the Premier League charges. But equally, history shows that once the magic has gone in football, it is very hard to get it back (look at Inter in 1966-67, dominant and seemingly en route to a Treble only, abruptly to lose form, winning only two of their final 11 games of the season to end up with nothing; Helenio Herrera was given another season, in which they finished fifth). In a month, City\u2019s aura has vanished, but who realistically looks a better candidate than Guardiola to restore it?

Large-scale aggression by terrorist groups and gangs is assessed as aimed at undermining the sovereignty, political and socioeconomic stability of the Syrian state.\u201d Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency reports that Israeli troops launched two artillery shells at the town of Beit Lif, and opened machine gun fire towards the town of Yaroun. Local media is also reporting an airstrike near Houla in southern Lebanon. At least two people were killed on Monday in Israeli strikes on southern Lebanon, Lebanese authorities said, as the speaker of Lebanon\u2019s parliament accused Israel of 54 violations of the recent ceasefire deal. One person was killed in an Israeli air attack on the southern Lebanese town of Marjayoun, about 10 km from the UN-drawn blue line that separates Lebanon from Israel, Reuters reports, citing Lebanon\u2019s health ministry. In a different incident, Lebanon\u2019s state security said an Israeli drone strike had killed a member of its force while he was on duty in Nabatieh, 12 km from the border. State security called it a \u201cflagrant violation\u201d of the truce. The Lebanese army said an Israeli drone hit an army bulldozer in northeast Lebanon near the border with Syria, wounding one soldier. The National News Agency also reported a fresh Israeli incursion inside Lebanon, near the Mays al-Jabal governmental hospital which is close to Tebnin Castle. In a statement on social media, Lebanon\u2019s speaker of parliament Nabih Berri, who has acted on behalf of Hezbollah during ceasefire negotiations, said Israel\u2019s actions \u201crepresent a clear violation of the articles of the ceasefire agreement\u201d and said they have \u201cexceeded 54 violations in Lebanon.\u201d Israel has denied this, saying it reserves the right to use force to prevent Hezbollah breaching the ceasefire, claiming armed operatives have been spotted south of the Litani River. At the end of the 60 day ceasefire period, the agreement states that all Israeli forces should have withdrawn from Lebanon, and that Hezbollah should have retreated north of the Litani River, effectively leaving a buffer zone in souther Lebanon where only the Lebanese army and UN-peacekeeping forces are allowed to deploy. Earlier Israel\u2019s military issued an order forbidding Lebanese civilians to return to dozens of villages in the south. Tens of thousands of Lebanese and Israelis in the border areas of both countries have been forced to flee their homes by the fighting. Here is the quote from Lebanon\u2019s speaker of parliament Nabih Berri\u2019s social media accounts, in which he calls for action to be taken against Israel for what he says are 54 violations of the ceasefire agreement. He said that: Contrary to everything promoted in the media \u2026 what the Israeli occupation forces are doing \u2013 from the aggressive actions of the demolition of houses in the Lebanese border villages with occupied Palestine [Israel] is added to by the continuation of air raids and the execution of strikes that targeted more than once the depths of the Lebanese areas, during which martyrs and wounded fell. All these actions represent a clear violation of the articles of the ceasefire agreement \u2026 we ask the technical committee appointed to monitor the implementation of this agreement \u2026 which have exceeded 54 violations in Lebanon. Yesterday French diplomats cited 52 violations of the ceasefire by Israel. Israel has denied this, with Israeli foreign minister Gideon Saar reported to have told French counterpart Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot on the phone today that Israel is \u201cenforcing [ceasefire terms] in the face of Hezbollah\u2019s violations that require an immediate response in real time,\u201d claiming that Hezbollah operatives have been seen armed south of the Litani River. Ruth Michaelson has this report for the Guardian Iranian-backed Iraqi militias crossed into eastern Syria overnight in an attempt to shore up struggling forces loyal to Damascus, battling an insurgency that has swept much of the country\u2019s north-west as Islamist militants seized control of Aleppo. The Iraqi militants, which include fighters from Kataib Hezbollah and Fatemiyoun groups, arrived near the eastern Syrian town of Bukamal overnight to join units already deployed within Syria in support of Damascus, according to the Associated Press. Forces loyal to the president, Bashar al-Assad, were unexpectedly swept from Syria\u2019s second city over the weekend after an offensive spearheaded by Islamist militants from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), who claimed swaths of new territory across northern Syria along with rebel groups backed by Turkey. The defence ministry in Damascus said it had deployed military reinforcements to Hama and other flashpoints as they attempted to mount a counterattack, amid reports of further Syrian and Russian airstrikes on Idlib, the centre of HTS control. Read more from Ruth Michaelson here: Iran-backed Iraqi militias join fight in Syria after militants seize Aleppo The Israeli military said on Monday it had attacked military vehicles operating in the vicinity of military infrastructure belonging to Hezbollah in Lebanon\u2019s Bekaa, Reuters reports. Troops also attacked military vehicles used to transfer weapons near the border between Syria and Lebanon in Hermel, the Israeli military said in a statement, acknowledging that a Lebanese soldier was injured in one of its strikes. Lebanon\u2019s parliament speaker Nabih Berri asked the committee supervising the ceasefire with Israel on Monday to oblige Israel to stop ceasefire violations and withdraw from the Lebanese territories, Reuters reports, citing a statement from his office on social media. Here are some more details from Reuters about talks between the US and UEA and the possibility of lifting sanctions on Syria. First mentioned at 12:24pm GMT. The conversations intensified in recent months, the sources said, driven by the possible expiry on 20 December of sweeping US sanctions on Syria and by Israel\u2019s campaign against Tehran\u2019s regional network, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza and Iranian assets in Syria. The discussions took place before anti-Assad rebels swept into Aleppo last week in their biggest offensive in Syria for years. According to the sources, the new rebel advance is a signal of precisely the sort of weakness in Assad\u2019s alliance with Iran that the Emirati and US initiative aims to exploit. But if Assad embraces Iranian help for a counter-offensive, that could also complicate efforts to drive a wedge between them, the sources said. Iran\u2019s foreign minister Abbas Araqchi visited Syria on Sunday in a show of support for Assad, and UAE President sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan spoke to Assad by phone about latest developments at the weekend. For this story, Reuters spoke to two U.S. sources, four Syrian and Lebanese interlocutors and two foreign diplomats who said the US and UAE see a window to drive a wedge between Assad and Iran, which helped him recapture swathes of his country during the civil war that erupted in 2011. Lebanese media have reported that Israel had suggested lifting US sanctions on Syria. But the UAE initiative with the US has not previously been reported. All of the sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the back-room diplomacy. Syria\u2019s government and the White House did not respond to questions from Reuters. The UAE referred Reuters to its statement on bin Zayed\u2019s call with Assad. The president of the international criminal court said threats facing the institution, including possible US sanctions and Russian warrants for staff members, \u201cjeopardise its very existence\u201d, Reuters reports. Speaking at an annual conference of the court\u2019s 124 members on Monday, president Judge Tomoko Akane did not name Russia or the US, but referred to them as permanent members of the UN security council. Russia issued an arrest warrant for ICC chief Prosecutor Karim Khan two months after the court in The Hague issued a warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin. The United States House of Representatives in June passed a bill to sanction the court in response to Khan\u2019s request for an arrest warrant against prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence chief, Yoav Gallant. \u201cThe Court has been subjected to attacks seeking to undermine its legitimacy and ability to administer justice and realise international law and fundamental rights; coercive measures, threats, pressure and acts of sabotage,\u201d Akane said, adding that more warrants had been issued against court employees. The ICC is also \u201cbeing threatened with draconian economic sanctions from institutions of another permanent member of the Security Council as if it was a terrorist organisation. These measures would rapidly undermine the Court\u2019s operations in all situations and cases and jeopardise its very existence,\u201d she said. While the US is not a member of the court, the world\u2019s preeminent military and financial power could undermine the ICC diplomatically and politically and with financial sanctions targeting its staff. She said the court firmly rejects any \u201cattempt to influence (its) independence and impartiality. We resolutely dismiss efforts to politicise our function. We have and always will comply only with the law, under all circumstances.\u201d Sources have told Reuters that the US and UAE have discussed lifting sanctions on Syria if Bashar al-Assad peels away from Iran and cuts off weapons to Hezbollah. Returning to Syria for a moment, two Iraqi security sources have told Reuters that at least 300 fighters, primarily from the Iran-backed Badr and Nujabaa groups, crossed into the country from Iraq late on Sunday using a dirt road to avoid the official border crossing. Earlier a senior Syrian military source told the news agency \u201cThese are fresh reinforcements being sent to aid our comrades on the frontlines in the north,\u201d adding that the fighters had crossed in small groups to avoid airstrikes. Iran\u2019s foreign minister Abbas Araqchi said on Monday Syria\u2019s military was capable of confronting the rebels but, referring to the regional militia groups that Tehran backs, he added \u201cresistance groups will help and Iran will provide any support needed\u201d. A blimp emblazoned with the message \u201cSave them now\u201d in a reference to hostages held by Hamas in Gaza has been flown over the Israeli prime minister\u2019s office in Jerusalem. Relatives and loved ones of those being held captive have repeatedly criticised Benjamin Netanyahu and his government for failing to secure a deal for their release. The Hamas-led health authority in Gaza has issued updated casualty figures, in which it claims at least 44,466 Palestinians were killed and 105,358 wounded since Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza began after the 7 October 2023 surprise attack inside Israel. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty figures being issued during the conflict. Here are some of the latest images from Gaza, where Palestinian media sources have said more people have been killed today by continued Israeli airstrikes. Syrian news agency Sana is carrying a readout of a call between Syria\u2019s president Bashar al-Assad and Iran\u2019s president Masoud Pezeshkian. It reports: During the call, Assad stressed the terrorist escalation taking place reflects far-reaching aims in an attempt to divide the region according to the interests of US and the west. [He] underlined this will absolutely not affect Syria and its army\u2019s determination to confront and eliminate terrorism all over the Syrian territories. In turn, Pezeshkian underscored Iran\u2019s full rejection of all attempts to target Syria\u2019s unity and stability, asserting that targeting its stability affects also the region\u2019s stability. Pezeshkian noted that the US-Zionist aims in targeting the countries and peoples of the region are clear, stressing Iran\u2019s readiness to provide all forms of support for Syria in order to eliminate terrorism and thwart the goals of its supporters. Turkey\u2019s foreign minister Hakan Fidan has called on the Syrian government and opposition to compromise, and said Turkey would be willing to help facilitate discussions. In a joint press conference with his counterpart from Iran in Ankara, Reuters reports Fidan said Turkey continues to support Syria\u2019s territorial integrity. Under Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s leadership, Turkey has been keen to play a mediating role in nearby conflicts, including in Ukraine, however Turkey has been accused of playing a destabilising role in northern Syria due to its campaign against Kurdish separatists. Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that \u201ca number of citizens were killed and injured\u201d by an Israeli strike on a house in Jabalia in the north of the Gaza Strip. Israel\u2019s far-right interior security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has said in a radio interview that he would move to a new Jewish settlement if one was built inside Gaza, saying \u201cOccupying territory, encouraging emigration. These are solutions that can allow for a different reality in Gaza.\u201d Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting for Al Jazeera from Deir al-Balah in Gaza, writes: Since morning, there have been several airstrikes in areas across Gaza. The Israeli military continues to pummel residential buildings. The latest, it struck a residential house in Beit Lahiya. Medical sources confirmed that they were unable to recover casualties from the site of the strike due to conditions. Al Jazeera has been banned from operating inside Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank by Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government. Israeli media reports that Israel has told France it rejects accusations it has breached the ceasefire in Lebanon. Israeli foreign minister Gideon Saar is reported to have told French counterpart Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot on the phone that Israel is \u201cenforcing them in the face of Hezbollah\u2019s violations that require an immediate response in real time,\u201d claiming that Hezbollah operatives have been seen armed south of the Litani River. The terms of the ceasefire, which came into force on 27 November, give Israel 60 days to remove its forces from inside Lebanon. Kurdish YPG forces have begun pulling out of areas under their control in the north-eastern sector of Aleppo under a deal with rebel forces, Reuters understands. Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that since last night, Israeli security forces have arrested 12 people in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. It said the arrests were made across a number of locations, including in the governantes of Hebron, Ramallah and Tubas. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has reiterated Russian support for Bashar al-Assad during his regular morning press conference. Syria\u2019s Sana news agency reports \u201cjoint Syrian-Russian warplanes carried out aerial strikes on terrorist sites on the outskirts of al-Safira town \u2026 leaving scores of wounded and killed among their ranks.\u201d Al-Safira is to the south-east of Aleppo. The claims have not been independently verified. Israeli media reports that prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu will give testimony in his corruption trial not in Jerusalem as originally planned, but in a fortified bunker in Tel Aviv. Netanyahu\u2019s lawyers have sought to delay him giving testimony, arguing that conducting the war has deprived him of the opportunity to prepare his defence, and the security implications of having him appear at a known time and public location. The Times of Israel reports \u201cthe Tel Aviv location was agreed on as the best location by the court and the Shin Bet\u201d. Netanyahu is due to appear on 10 December. He is charged with fraud, breach of trust and bribery. He has denied all the charges, accusing them of being a political witch-hunt against him. Tasnim news agency in Iran is reporting that foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei has warned that insecurity in Syria will not be confined to Syria but spread across the region, and cited the presence of US forces in the area as an aggravating factor in the unrest. He is quoted as saying: We all have come to the conclusion that any sort of insecurity in Syria won\u2019t be limited to Syria alone. We are all aware of the fact that terrorism would not be concentrated in a single place and spreads to other areas. Our Turkish friends are as much concerned as we are about the course of developments in Syria. It is clear that one of the reasons for \u2026 terrorism in Syria has been the occupation by the American military forces. Israel\u2019s military has announced that it believes hostage Capt Omer Neutra, an Israeli soldier abducted into Gaza on 7 October 2023, is dead, and was killed on the morning of the attack. His body remains held in Gaza. Recently appointed defense minister Israel Katz has posted to social media to offer his \u201cdeepest condolences\u201d to the Neutra family. He described the US-Israeli, who was born in New York, as representing \u201cthe good and strong in our nation\u201d who \u201csacrificed his life for the security of the state of Israel against the worst of our enemies.\u201d Iran\u2019s military consultants remain in Syria at Damascus\u2019 request, Reuters reports Iran\u2019s foreign ministry Spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said on Monday. In a statement Israel\u2019s military has said that warning sirens that sounded overnight in Hanita, a kibbutz close to Lebanon, were \u201cdetermined to be a false alarm\u201d. Israel has issued an order prohibiting the inhabitants of dozens of villages in the south of the country from returning to their homes. In a message posted to social media, Israel\u2019s Arabic language spokesperson issued a map of the prohibited area and said \u201cThe IDF does not intend to target you and therefore you are prohibited at this stage from returning to your homes from this line south until further notice.\u201d Under the terms of the ceasefire agreement, which came into effect on 27 November, Israel has 60 days to withdraw its forces from the country, while the Lebanese army is expected to deploy into the region. Tens of thousands of Lebanese people and tens of thousands of Israelis on either side of the UN-drawn blue line that separates the two countries had been forced to flee their homes after over a year of near constant exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and the IDF. Overnight Israel\u2019s chief of staff Herzi Halevi justified continued military activity inside the Israeli-occupied West Bank, saying \u201cWe don\u2019t wait for terrorists.\u201d Speaking after the IDF mounted an operation inside occupied Jenin, Halevi said in a statement: We don\u2019t wait for terrorists; we reach wherever necessary \u2013 until we eliminate those who threaten our security. Initiative and proactive action are the key to our successes here. The offensive and pre-emptive efforts, such as this morning\u2019s strike, enable us to continue fighting effectively in Lebanon, Gaza, and even in more distant arenas. Iranian news agency Tasnim is carrying a read-out of a call between Iran\u2019s president Masoud Pezeshkian and Iraq\u2019s prime minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani. It reports that Pezeshkian said \u201cAs the region was moving towards relative calm following the ceasefire in Lebanon, and attention was turning to Gaza, the recent events in Syria caused serious concerns about regional security.\u201d It reports Pezeshkian said it was \u201cessential for the Islamic community to unite and work together to prevent the spread of terrorism in the region,\u201d and he suggested that Israel was attempting to spread \u201cinsecurity, discord, and conflict within Islamic countries.\u201d Iranian-backed militias entered Syria overnight from Iraq and were heading to northern Syria to reinforce Syrian army forces battling insurgents, two Syrian army sources have told Reuters. \u201cThese are fresh reinforcements being sent to aid our comrades on the frontlines in the north,\u201d a senior army source told the news agency. Pro-Assad media in Syria, citing health minister Dr Ahmed Damiriyeh, report that ambulances and the emergency services in Aleppo have resumed their work after being out of commission for two days following attacks. The claims have not been independently verified. Overnight Syria\u2019s national news agency reported that the telephone network in Aleppo, which has falling to insurgent forces, \u201chas suffered significant damage and several exchanges have gone out of service.\u201d Welcome to our ongoing coverage of the conflict in the Middle East. Here are the headlines \u2026 Iranian-backed militias entered Syria overnight from Iraq and were heading to northern Syria to reinforce beleaguered Syrian army forces battling insurgents A US-backed, Kurdish-led force in Syria is seeking to evacuate Kurds in parts of Aleppo to safe areas, its chief said Monday, after pro-Turkey rebels seized a town where tens of thousands of Kurds were living Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi travelled to the Syrian capital Damascus, where he told reporters in Iran the purpose of his visit was to convey the strength of Tehran\u2019s backing for Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and his rule Assad, whose regime is also backed by Moscow, has vowed to \u201cdefend [Syria\u2019s] stability and territorial integrity in the face of all terrorists and their backers\u201d Turkey\u2019s top diplomat discussed the shock rebel offensive in Syria with US secretary of state Antony Blinken, saying Ankara would support moves \u201cto reduce tension\u201d in the war-torn country. In a phone call, foreign minister Hakan Fidan told Blinken Turkey was \u201cagainst any development that would increase instability in the region\u201d The international criminal court\u2019s member states open their annual meeting Monday. The assembly of states parties, which represents the ICC\u2019s 124 member countries, will convene its 23rd conference to elect committee members and approve the court\u2019s budget Israel is reportedly closely monitoring developments in the Syrian uprising, fearing that Iran may send significant forces into the country. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a second meeting about Syria last might, amid fears Iranian troops could be deployed next to Israel\u2019s borders and that Tehran might use it as an opportunity to deliver weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon Netanyahu\u2019s wife Sara Netanyahu met with US president-elect Donald Trump on Sunday, in an event he held in his golf course in Florida",

Zena is the working-class secretary helping his uncle Alaric write a very boring book, and class, money and changing political times throw them together.

Say You\u2019ll Be My Jaan Naina Kumar, Penguin \u201cThink of it like Tinder,\u201d we\u2019re told of arranged marriage. \u201cExcept your parents are the algorithm.\u201d Fake-relationship romances are nothing new, but this one is particularly lovely. Karthik is work-focused and trying to placate his mother; Meghna is still in love with The One Who Got Away and needs a plus-one for his wedding, so they agree to an arranged engagement \u2013 and guess what? Kumar jumps perspectives easily and keeps things moving in a novel that\u2019s so warm and funny, and particularly good on food and cultural expectations, that\u2019s it\u2019s incredibly impressive that it\u2019s a debut. What Does it Feel Like? Sophie Kinsella, Bantam A tiny gem of a novella about being diagnosed with brain cancer that also manages to fit a deeply funny and affecting love story into its 128 pages. Closely mirroring Kinsella\u2019s own life, it explores what happens when the person you love has to tell you over and over again that you have cancer, because the cancer means that you keep forgetting. If this sounds grim, it is quite the opposite; the book is life-affirming in the very best way. The idea of romance as something that persists when everything else is gone \u2013 a true love that will stay solid as a rock over a lifetime \u2013 is incredibly affecting. Small Bomb at Dimperley Lissa Evans, Doubleday Evans\u2019s ability to not just write historical fiction, but to bring us what feel like newly unearthed novels from the time, is unparalleled. Small Bomb at Dimperley is an utterly delightful postwar romance in which the dashing heir to England\u2019s ugliest stately home has been killed in the war, so younger son Valentine inherits, to everyone\u2019s disappointment. Zena is the working-class secretary helping his uncle Alaric write a very boring book, and class, money and changing political times throw them together. It feels as though it could have been written by Eva Ibbotson: there can be no higher praise. The episode involving a horse and a train toilet was my funniest scene of the year. The Echoes of Us Emma Steele, Mountain Leopard Robbie and Jenn are on the brink of reconciling after a breakup when they are hit by a truck. Robbie is thrown back in time to witness episodes from their original relationship: where it went wrong, and how he can save it in the future. With One Day-style scenes over the years, a time-travel mystery and an endearing romance, this extremely enjoyable novel is a proper Christmas page-turner. \u2022 To browse all romance books included in the Guardian and Observer\u2019s best books of 2024 visit guardianbookshop.com.

As Rhymefest, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chicago\">Chicago</a> native announced himself as a formidable battle rapper, verbally sparring with Eminem and other stars in the late 90s. He co-wrote some of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest\">Kanye West</a>\u2019s biggest hits, not least the Grammy-winning Jesus Walks, while carving out his own exemplary career as a conscious emcee. He won a Golden Globe and an Oscar for Glory, the Selma film soundtrack theme he co-wrote with John Legend and Common, a fellow Chicagoan.</p> \n<p>Even as the successes piled up, Smith, 47, never stopped thinking about his humanitarian obligation to his home town of Chicago, cut down to a metonym for urban violence and rot.</p> \n<p>This year, when Chicago held school board elections, the first in the city\u2019s history, Smith decided to run as an independent because he believed his experiences and relationships in the art and music community could prove beneficial.</p> \n<p>\u201cI had my eye on this,\u201d says Smith, an imposingly sage presence who commands attention whether on the stage or the stump. \u201cI knew how historic an elected school board would be to Chicago, the last major municipality that did not have the democracy of an elected school board.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pitted against a pastor, a non-profit CEO and a former district principal, Smith won with 32% of the vote. Once sworn in, he hopes to use art to expand students\u2019 horizons. \u201cIn terms of Stem \u2013 science, technology, engineering and math \u2013 why are we not adding arts to make Steam?\u201d says Smith, a former teaching fellow at the University of Chicago\u2019s Institute of Politics. \u201cI know it sounds cliche, but if you\u2019re taking a trigonometry class and learning angles, <em>and</em> you\u2019re in art class learning angles, it could make you better at trigonometry.\u201d</p> \n<p>Smith\u2019s twinning of commercial artistry with activism separates him from his rap celebrity peers who\u2019d sooner shovel money into a foundation and occasionally turn up to hand out school supplies.</p> \n<p>He might have become one of those check-writing celebrities if West\u2019s mother, Donda, hadn\u2019t intervened. \u201cOne of my biggest teachers,\u201d Smith says of the late mentor he called Miss Maya, for Maya Angelou. \u201cWe would [come to campus] and play music for her when we\u2019re 14 or 15. When she would hear us talk about shooting or selling dope, she would ask, \u2018Is that really who you are? And if you get famous, is that who you want to be? Because if that is who people perceive you as, you\u2019re going to have to live inside that character for the rest of your life.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Smith and Ye (as the artist is now known) have been friends since they were teenagers, bonding over music. They came of age as Chicago was emerging as a hive of socially conscious rap and hip-hop force to rival the coasts. With Common and the producer No ID as guides and Twista and Lupe Fiasco pushing them, Smith and Ye emerged as a dynamic duo \u2013 the former putting weighty words to the latter\u2019s chipmunk soul beats, inspiring generations of homegrown talents that run from Chance the Rapper to Earl Sweatshirt.</p> \n<p>In 2011, Smith and Ye founded Art of Culture, a youth mentoring non-profit where Smith teaches writing and leads cultural retreats around the world.<em> </em>It was originally named Donda\u2019s House. But differences of opinion over how the non-profit should be run drove a years-long rift between the two. Things are better between them now. \u201cWhat we do have is brotherhood,\u201d Smith says. \u201cAnd I think we as human beings in America have to learn how to have brotherhood and village without always expecting somebody to make our dream come true.\u201d</p> \n<p>Smith\u2019s imagination has carried him quite a distance. Unlike Ye, who was raised middle-class, Smith grew up poor and was raised by a single mother who had him at 15. He recounts some of this in a 2015 Showtime documentary called In My Father\u2019s House. In it, Smith is driven to reunite with his father, absent from his life since age 12, after purchasing his childhood home. Despite dropping out of high school to pursue music, Smith gravitated to Donda and other individual teachers in his neighborhood \u2013 not least the Rev Jesse Jackson, who opened up the south side headquarters of his Operation Push civil rights organization for Wu-Tang concerts and rap shows featuring local artists.</p> \n<p>After seeing that combination of song and social responsibility play out so seamlessly up close, with Donda\u2019s \u201csage counsel\u201d still ringing in his ears, Smith committed himself to a more practical brand of rap realness. \u201cWhen you hear lines like \u2018we all self conscious / I\u2019m just the first to admit it\u2019 [from Ye\u2019s All Falls Down], that didn\u2019t come from how brilliant we are as artists,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThat came from teachers that trained us how to be authentic. We have great teachers here that work with you in art. And the same way that was done for me, it\u2019s my duty to serve in that way for up and coming artists.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chicago city politics are notorious for being a vipers\u2019 pit of sharp-elbowed, take-no-prisoners wheeler-dealing, defined by major party crony favor-trading for the better part of a century. The standard was set by Richard J Daley, the imperious mayor fabled to have fixed the 1960 presidential election for John F Kennedy. Decades later the same political machine would put Barack Obama in the White House.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s only in the last few years that the Chicago Teachers Union has emerged as a major political player, funneling more than $23m into Illinois candidate Pacs since 2010 \u2013 investment that culminated in the 2023 election of the mayor, Brandon Johnson, a former public school social studies teacher. In 2023 CTU and its affiliate unions spent nearly $6.5m on Chicago elections, more than any interest group.</p> \n<p>Smith wasn\u2019t the strongest candidate to represent district 10 \u2013 a craggy south side outcropping where a handful of high-performing schools are sprinkled among the failing and condemned. His given name alone, Che, taken from the Marxist revolutionary, writes its own attack ads; his Muslim faith provides the exclamation point.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have a brother that walked across 15 countries, through the Dari\u00e9n Gap, who lives in my house,\u201d Smith says when I ask him how the immigration crisis is affecting city schools. \u201cChicago has been having low birth rates, 10,000 less children for the last 10 years. That means there are hardly any children to enroll in public schools.\u201d The new arrivals, he argues, keep the schools filled and funded.</p> \n<p>Then of course there\u2019s the matter of Smith\u2019s music career, another potential reason for voters to not take him seriously. Broadly, Smith takes offense at the way musicians are treated in the political arena, as if they\u2019re only good for kicking off rallies. It pained him to watch Lil Jon deliver Georgia\u2019s roll call at this year\u2019s Democratic national convention in Chicago. \u201cLil Jon\u2019s father is an aerospace engineer and his mother is a military nurse,\u201d Smith says. \u201cHe can relate to people whether they\u2019re low information or high information, and he\u2019s not the only one. Kanye is the son of a Fulbright scholar. Lupe\u2019s mom was a community activist. Chance\u2019s parents are political operatives in the city. Why wouldn\u2019t you let them reimagine policy? It\u2019s a missed opportunity, but we artists have to take it upon ourselves not to wait to be handed power.\u201d</p> \n<p>Smith might have waited longer to make his move if Mark Ronson, a close collaborator and one-time label boss, hadn\u2019t pushed him to write an open letter to the former British prime minister David Cameron after the then Conservative party leader took exception to the hip-hop-coded content on BBC Radio 1 in 2006, saying it \u201cencourages people to carry guns and knives\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cDavid Cameron \u2013 someone who I have very little, if anything, in common with \u2013 inspired me to know what my influence was as an artist and leverage my cultural currency for social and political justice,\u201d recalls Smith. \u201cBut he said something that made sense in our meeting: \u2018I turn on the radio, and all I hear is sirens, gunshots and violent rhetoric. I thought it was a national emergency. What am I supposed to do with that as a political leader?\u2019</p> \n<p>\u201cI thought he had a point,\u201d Smith goes on. But what I had to tell him is that his politics created that warning shot he heard on the radio.\u201d</p> \n<p>He believes one reason Cameron ultimately lost power is because he \u201cwas never really in tune with the people on the street\u201d.</p> \n<p>Keen to live up to his independent tag, Smith put $100,000 of his own nest egg into his school board bid \u2013 which was notably not endorsed by the Chicago Teachers Union. He says his victory is a credit to a grassroots coalition that ran the gamut from \u201cthe streets\u201d to former university students \u2013 whose votes he counted as a \u201c\u2018very good\u2019 professor rating\u201d. He further appreciates that some of the same people who voted for him also voted for Donald Trump \u2013 a man who once disparaged Chicago as a \u201cwar-torn\u201d city of Black people and Latinos \u201cliving in hell\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cVotes for Trump went up across the board in Black communities and Latino communities,\u201d Smith says of the rightward shift in deep blue Chicago. \u201cThey voted for a deconstructor of systems. There\u2019s a political realignment happening in America, and I don\u2019t even think the institutions have caught up with it. There are a lot of people that long for the dismantling of the system for the opportunity to build it anew.\u201d</p> \n<p>Smith has a lot he wants to tackle in his first term \u2013 busing, strategic partnerships, the district\u2019s $1bn budget shortfall. That doesn\u2019t seem like it leaves much room for making or performing music. But because school board politics is essentially pro bono work, he\u2019ll have to find the time. \u201cYou have to ask yourself, why are these interests putting millions of dollars into running candidates for a job that doesn\u2019t pay?\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>There was a time in the not too distant past when Smith thought his raptivism could have lasting impact only if he were on a similar fame level to Ye, and not just a dope lyricist. But after his landmark victory, Smith feels like he\u2019s finally meeting the political moment that was laid out for him long ago and is encouraging his industry peers to take similar authorship. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to make a song anymore,\u201d he says. \u201cYou gotta make a song and then create a reality from it. It\u2019s time to take all those raps and all those words and start to walk through them and create a better society from the imagination of the music. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p>",

Lawyers for Dawn Sturgess\u2019s relatives argued the UK authorities should have anticipated Skripal would have been a target, especially as he appeared to have continued to work with western security agencies after he was pardoned by Russia, but left him a \u201csitting duck\u201d. On the final day of public hearings into Sturgess\u2019s death, her family\u2019s legal team criticised public health experts for not issuing public warnings about picking up containers that may have contained nerve agent after the attack on Skripal in Salisbury in March 2018. They also strongly criticised Wiltshire police for \u201carrogantly\u201d stereotyping Sturgess as a drug user \u2013 which she was not \u2013 when she fell critically ill in Amesbury, Wiltshire, in June 2018 after spraying herself with novichok contained in a fake perfume bottle. In his closing speech, Michael Mansfield KC, for the Sturgess family, said: \u201cWe say there\u2019s been an abject failure by the United Kingdom government to protect the public.\u201d He said a \u201cmajor disaster\u201d in which thousands of people could have died from nerve agent poisoning had been avoided only through good luck. Mansfield said: \u201cClearly what happened in Salisbury and the knock-on effect in Amesbury was preventable.\u201d Skripal moved to Salisbury after a spy exchange in 2010 and lived openly in the city without any security measures. Mansfield said there was \u201calarming access\u201d to him and \u201cno evidence that there were any precautions taken\u201d. He said it would have been simple to provide Skripal with an alternative identity, given him security measures such as CCTV and alarms and settle him in a gated community rather than in an ordinary suburban street. The barrister said it was \u201cmanifestly obvious\u201d that an attack was possible, especially after the poisoning of the former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, who was assassinated in the UK in 2006. Given the nature of the weapons the Russians were prepared to use, this caused \u201chuge collateral risk to the public\u201d. Mansfield said there was evidence Skripal had carried on helping western security agencies while he was in Salisbury, which made him a target, He cited interviews with the journalist Mark Urban in 2017, which the writer says were interrupted because Skripal had to go to speak to intelligence officials in Switzerland. Mansfield said the UK government knew that as long ago as 2013 Russian agents were monitoring the communications of Skripal\u2019s daughter, Yulia, and revealed the family believed the would-be assassins knew exactly what the Skripals\u2019 movements were in the days and hours leading up to the attack.

Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs is facing charges of sex trafficking and racketeering, according to a federal indictment unsealed in September that reads like a laundry list of criminal behavior including kidnapping, forced labor, bribery and other crimes. He faces even more allegations of sexual misconduct, after a Texas-based attorney revealed he is representing 120 accusers who allege misconduct against Combs over the course of two decades. In the past two years, Combs has hit the headlines in various ways that meant the mystique surrounding one of the biggest names in American music and popular culture was already deeply tarnished. Here is a timeline of events: 16 November 2023 Casandra Ventura files a lawsuit alleging horrific attacks and abuse Casandra Ventura, a singer and model known as Cassie who dated Combs for more than a decade, files a lawsuit against him, alleging incidents of rape and physical assault between 2007 and 2018. She describes \u201ca cycle of abuse, violence, and sex trafficking\u201d after being lured into a \u201costentatious, fast-paced, and drug-fueled lifestyle\u201d allegedly designed to keep her compliant \u2013 including engaging in sex acts with others against her will. The lawsuit also alleged that he destroyed the car of another successful US rapper, Kid Cudi \u2013 real name Scott Mescudi \u2013 to deter him from seeing Ventura. Combs denied the allegations. The severity of Ventura\u2019s allegations are the most serious Combs has faced..

Later, on 26 April 2024, Combs\u2019s lawyers file a motion to dismiss elements of Dickerson-Neal\u2019s lawsuit. These lawsuits, and some of the other subsequent ones filed against Combs, were made possible by New York state laws such as the Adult Survivors Act and the Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Act that allowed for lawsuits alleging sexual assault to be made even if the statute of limitations \u2013 ie the window of time for the allegations to originally be made \u2013 had expired. 29 November 2023 Combs steps down as chair of Revolt Combs steps down as chair of the TV network he founded, Revolt.

He said more than than 3,000 individuals come forward to his office with accusations against Combs. Buzbee said that the new civil claims against Combs will include \u201cviolent sexual assault or rape, facilitated sex with a controlled substance, dissemination of video recordings, sexual abuse of minors\u201d. 10 October 2024 Combs sex-trafficking trial to start in May 2025, judge decides Combs\u2019s sex-trafficking trial is scheduled to start on 5 May, 2025. During an appearance in Manhattan, prosecutors revealed that authorities seized 96 electronic devices in raids of Combs\u2019s Miami and Los Angeles homes, as well as a private airport in South Florida. Prosecutors said Combs might face more charges, something they have floated during prior court proceedings. Combs\u2019s lawyers have pushed unsuccessfully to get him freed on bail since his 16 September arrest. 14 October 2024 Combs hit with six new lawsuits alleging rape and sexual assault Combs was hit with six new lawsuits that accused the rap impresario of raping women, sexually assaulting men and molesting a 16-year-old boy. The plaintiffs in the lawsuits, filed anonymously in federal court under New York\u2019s Gender Motivated Violence Act, were identified only as two women \u2013 Jane Does \u2013 and four men, John Does. The accusers are part of what their attorney says is a group of more than 100 alleged victims who are in the process of suing Combs in the wake of his arrest in September. In a statement, attorneys for Combs said the tip line and new filings are \u201cclear attempts to garner publicity\u201d. The statement maintains that \u201cMr Combs has never sexually assaulted anyone \u2013 adult or minor, man or woman.\u201d 15 October 2024 Combs wants prosecutors to disclose the names of his accusers Combs wants prosecutors in his sex-trafficking case to disclose the names of his accusers, Manhattan federal court documents show. The music executive needs to know the identities of his accusers to prepare for the 5 May trial, his legal team argued in a Tuesday letter to Judge Arun Subramanian. 21 October 2024 Five new federal civil lawsuits filed A wave of new sexual assault and rape accusations have been made against Combs, including an accusation of rape from a then 13-year-old. Five new federal civil lawsuits have been filed against Combs. Among the plaintiffs, two are men and three are women. All of the alleged incidents reportedly occurred at parties hosted by the music mogul. In one lawsuit, the Jane Doe claims that in 2000, when she was 13 years old, Combs invited her to attend his MTV Video Music Awards afterparty where she was allegedly drugged and raped. All five lawsuits were filed in the southern district of New York by the Texas-based attorney Tony Buzbee. \u201cWe expect to be filing cases weekly naming Mr Combs and others as defendants as we continue to gather evidence and prepare the filings,\u201d Buzbee said in a statement to NBC News. 16 November 2024 Combs accused of reaching out to prospective witnesses from jail Combs has tried to reach out to prospective witnesses and influence public opinion from jail in a bid to affect potential jurors for his upcoming sex-trafficking trial, prosecutors claimed in a court filing that was part of a bail request. 28 November 2024 Combs denied bail for the third time Combs has been denied bail for the third time by a judge in New York City who described him as a \u201cserious risk\u201d for witness tampering. 2 December 2024 Combs could have settled Ventura\u2019s suit privately but didn\u2019t Combs had the opportunity to settle Ventura\u2019s accusations of rape and other physical abuse before she went public \u2013 but he refused, according to the forthcoming podcast The Rise and Fall of Diddy. \u201cShe came to him before she filed [any] lawsuit and said, \u2018I believed I was wronged by you,\u2019\u201d attorney and legal commentator Donte Mills says on the podcast from Law &amp; Crime, a preview of which was provided to the Guardian. \u201cAnd she gave him an opportunity to settle the case before she brought [a] lawsuit.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A titan in world archaeology, Colin Renfrew, Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn, who has died aged 87, tackled questions key to understanding who we are \u2013 what makes us human, how migration changes culture, why civilisations appear, what art means \u2013 with new evidence as well as argument. His determination to address big issues with science and data fired his enthusiastic embrace of new ideas and technologies, and his joy in directing excavations. </p> <p>Renfrew entered archaeology in the 1960s at a time of profound change. Younger practitioners were discovering the promise of new sciences and computers, and questioning accepted ideas about prehistory and how to tell its stories. Statistics replaced intuition, in what became known internationally as the New Archaeology, with Renfrew a UK figurehead and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/may/17/lewis-binford-obituary\">Lewis Binford</a>, his friend and sparring partner in disruption, in the US. </p> <p>Renfrew announced his arrival in 1968 with the paper Wessex Without Mycenae, published in the Annual of the British School at Athens. Using then controversial radiocarbon dating, he challenged long-held assumptions about the rise of early civilisation. Archaeologists had assumed innovations in northern Europe had been adopted from the south, allowing the former to be dated by inferred links to calendars in the eastern Mediterranean. With forensic perception, Renfrew realised that the new dates showed that people in the north must have engineered their own achievements \u2013 among them Stonehenge, seen to be older than its supposed Greek designers. As Renfrew saw, breaking the links opened the field to new ideas about how changes occurred. </p> <p>Not all were ready to accept his case, but he developed the theme in his first book, The Emergence of Civilisation: The Cyclades and the Aegean in the Third Millennium BC (1972), which, like the earlier paper, was turned down by his original choice of publisher. Drawing on his University of Cambridge doctoral thesis, in a tour de force that many consider remains the best of his 60 books (including those he edited and co-authored), he set out a theory of how societies change. He then applied the model, with striking insight, to the appearance in the bronze age of palace economies in Crete and mainland Greece.</p> <p>Carbon dating led to a call from the BBC, and in 1971 the first of several films for the Chronicle series, The Tree That Put the Clock Back, in which Renfrew expounded on ancient peoples in distant locations. Documentaries then were not afraid to challenge viewers, and Renfrew, in raincoat and cloth cap, rose to the occasion, frequently inspired by the experience to conduct new research. </p> <p>Visiting Orkney in 1971 for the first time with the presenter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/09/guardianobituaries.broadcasting\">Magnus Magnusson</a>, who became a close friend, he decided to excavate a neolithic burial mound there. He thought Stonehenge might be explained as the creation of chiefdom societies, wrote another controversial paper (now brushing off critical anthropologists as well as archaeologists) and went filming in Easter Island and Tonga like an excited child with new toys \u2013 but, as always, with a mature determination to use them in his grand venture to fathom humanity.</p>    <p>His first academic post was as a lecturer in prehistory and archaeology at the University of Sheffield (1965\u201372). In 1968 he stood as a Conservative candidate in Sheffield Brightside, substantially reducing the Labour majority. Offered a safe Conservative seat at a future election, he realised he would have to give up archaeology, and declined. He moved in 1972 as professor of archaeology to the University of Southampton, where he was instrumental in setting up the Theoretical Archaeology Group (TAG), a free-thinking conference for staff and students that still meets annually at universities across the UK. </p> <p>Renowned as an inspiring and demanding teacher, and honoured by his peers (he was a fellow of both the Society of Antiquaries of London and of Scotland, and of the British Academy), in 1981 he was elected Disney professor of archaeology at the University of Cambridge. He wrote Archaeology and Language (1987), arguing that Indo-European languages were spread by expanding populations of the first farmers, a controversial theory he came to abandon \u2013 characteristically standing down in the face of new evidence \u2013 in favour of more recent horse-empowered migrations. With Paul Bahn he co-authored the standard textbook Archaeology (1991, now in its ninth edition). And he embarked on a new project: active engagement with contemporary art.</p> <p>Renfrew\u2019s enthusiasm had begun in his teens with visits to a friend of his parents, Ted Power, whose exceptional collection of modern art ranged from Brancusi to Barnett Newman and Jackson Pollock; he later reviewed art for Varsity, the Cambridge student paper. In 1986 he was invited to be master of Jesus College, Cambridge, an office he held for 11 years. Filling the master\u2019s lodge with his own growing collection, he founded the Sculpture in the Close exhibition series, which opened with Richard Long digging up the lawn. Renfrew became friends with many featured artists, who also included the Chapman brothers, Mark Dion, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/sep/01/barry-flanagan-obituary\">Barry Flanagan</a>, Antony Gormley and Cornelia Parker, and he sought to reconcile his emotive response to art with his intellectual concern for the past. </p> <p>In his book Figuring It Out (2003), he argued, not always convincingly, that artists and archaeologists were on parallel quests to understand the nature of being human. Gormley and the writer Ben Okri were among the 40 people who spoke at his 80th birthday celebration.</p> <p>In 1990 he became founding director of the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, a focus for science and fieldwork. Daniel McClean McDonald, an industrialist, had approached him with a proposal that led to a new building and an endowment for research and running costs, funded by one of the largest gifts of its kind received by Cambridge University. </p> <p>The following year Renfrew was offered a life peerage by John Major, then the prime minister, which he accepted only after being persuaded by Ken Clarke, a friend since student days and then education minister, that attending the House of Lords one day a week would be enough. The politician Tim Loughton, a former student of his, with whom Renfrew co-chaired the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on archaeology, considered him an example of the best of the Lords, someone at the top of their game contributing to academic and heritage policy at a high level; Renfrew also co-chaired an effective APPG for the protection of cultural heritage. He left the Lords in 2021, having retired from the Disney chair in 2004.</p> <p>An only child, Renfrew was born in Stockton-on-Tees and shortly afterwards moved with his parents, Helena (nee Savage) and Archibald, to Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, where his father worked at ICI Plastics. His parents encouraged his interest in art and history, taking him to museums in Paris and Rome and to see megaliths in Spain, and he went to St Albans school on a scholarship. </p> <p>He did national service in Germany before gaining a first-class degree in archaeology and anthropology at St John\u2019s College, Cambridge (1962), having spent his first year studying natural sciences. As president of the Cambridge Union, he surprised fellow students by successfully inviting Lord Reith to speak.</p>    <p>He co-directed excavations at Quanterness, Orkney (1972\u201374), and, in Greece, Saliagos (1964-65), Sitagroi (1968-70), Phylakopi (1974\u201377), and a long-running project on the Cycladic island of Keros. Keros had suffered extensive looting of small marble figurines redolent of works by Brancusi and Modigliani. The archaeologists decided the tiny island had been a central place for the Cyclades where around 2500BC people brought the broken carvings for ritual burial; a common theme of his excavations was resolving ways to identify and characterise shrines and religious behaviour. </p> <p>After publication of his book featuring a private collection of figurines, The Cycladic Spirit (1991), it emerged that many were looted, and he began his work countering the illicit antiquities trade, which he said damaged ancient sites and tainted artefacts, rendering both valueless. He was scathing of those museums and private collectors in Europe and North America whom, he charged, ignored the effects of their acquisitiveness on countries unable to protect their heritage, publishing an angry polemic, Loot, Legitimacy and Ownership, in 2000.</p> <p>He received many honours for his outstanding contributions to archaeology, including the Archaeological Institute of America\u2019s Bandelier award, the International Balzan prize and the European Science Foundation Latsis prize. He held many committee posts, among them as a trustee of the British Museum and a commissioner for English Heritage.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Jane (nee Ewbank), an archaeologist and botanist, whom he married in 1965, and their children, Helena, Alban and Magnus.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Colin Renfrew, Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn, archaeologist, born 25 July 1937; died 24 November 2024</p>",

Using then controversial radiocarbon dating, he challenged long-held assumptions about the rise of early civilisation. Archaeologists had assumed innovations in northern Europe had been adopted from the south, allowing the former to be dated by inferred links to calendars in the eastern Mediterranean. With forensic perception, Renfrew realised that the new dates showed that people in the north must have engineered their own achievements \u2013 among them Stonehenge, seen to be older than its supposed Greek designers. As Renfrew saw, breaking the links opened the field to new ideas about how changes occurred. Not all were ready to accept his case, but he developed the theme in his first book, The Emergence of Civilisation: The Cyclades and the Aegean in the Third Millennium BC (1972), which, like the earlier paper, was turned down by his original choice of publisher. Drawing on his University of Cambridge doctoral thesis, in a tour de force that many consider remains the best of his 60 books (including those he edited and co-authored), he set out a theory of how societies change. He then applied the model, with striking insight, to the appearance in the bronze age of palace economies in Crete and mainland Greece. Carbon dating led to a call from the BBC, and in 1971 the first of several films for the Chronicle series, The Tree That Put the Clock Back, in which Renfrew expounded on ancient peoples in distant locations. Documentaries then were not afraid to challenge viewers, and Renfrew, in raincoat and cloth cap, rose to the occasion, frequently inspired by the experience to conduct new research. Visiting Orkney in 1971 for the first time with the presenter Magnus Magnusson, who became a close friend, he decided to excavate a neolithic burial mound there. He thought Stonehenge might be explained as the creation of chiefdom societies, wrote another controversial paper (now brushing off critical anthropologists as well as archaeologists) and went filming in Easter Island and Tonga like an excited child with new toys \u2013 but, as always, with a mature determination to use them in his grand venture to fathom humanity. His first academic post was as a lecturer in prehistory and archaeology at the University of Sheffield (1965\u201372). In 1968 he stood as a Conservative candidate in Sheffield Brightside, substantially reducing the Labour majority. Offered a safe Conservative seat at a future election, he realised he would have to give up archaeology, and declined. He moved in 1972 as professor of archaeology to the University of Southampton, where he was instrumental in setting up the Theoretical Archaeology Group (TAG), a free-thinking conference for staff and students that still meets annually at universities across the UK. Renowned as an inspiring and demanding teacher, and honoured by his peers (he was a fellow of both the Society of Antiquaries of London and of Scotland, and of the British Academy), in 1981 he was elected Disney professor of archaeology at the University of Cambridge. He wrote Archaeology and Language (1987), arguing that Indo-European languages were spread by expanding populations of the first farmers, a controversial theory he came to abandon \u2013 characteristically standing down in the face of new evidence \u2013 in favour of more recent horse-empowered migrations. With Paul Bahn he co-authored the standard textbook Archaeology (1991, now in its ninth edition). And he embarked on a new project: active engagement with contemporary art. Renfrew\u2019s enthusiasm had begun in his teens with visits to a friend of his parents, Ted Power, whose exceptional collection of modern art ranged from Brancusi to Barnett Newman and Jackson Pollock; he later reviewed art for Varsity, the Cambridge student paper. In 1986 he was invited to be master of Jesus College, Cambridge, an office he held for 11 years. Filling the master\u2019s lodge with his own growing collection, he founded the Sculpture in the Close exhibition series, which opened with Richard Long digging up the lawn. Renfrew became friends with many featured artists, who also included the Chapman brothers, Mark Dion, Barry Flanagan, Antony Gormley and Cornelia Parker, and he sought to reconcile his emotive response to art with his intellectual concern for the past. In his book Figuring It Out (2003), he argued, not always convincingly, that artists and archaeologists were on parallel quests to understand the nature of being human. Gormley and the writer Ben Okri were among the 40 people who spoke at his 80th birthday celebration. In 1990 he became founding director of the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, a focus for science and fieldwork. Daniel McClean McDonald, an industrialist, had approached him with a proposal that led to a new building and an endowment for research and running costs, funded by one of the largest gifts of its kind received by Cambridge University. The following year Renfrew was offered a life peerage by John Major, then the prime minister, which he accepted only after being persuaded by Ken Clarke, a friend since student days and then education minister, that attending the House of Lords one day a week would be enough. The politician Tim Loughton, a former student of his, with whom Renfrew co-chaired the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on archaeology, considered him an example of the best of the Lords, someone at the top of their game contributing to academic and heritage policy at a high level; Renfrew also co-chaired an effective APPG for the protection of cultural heritage. He left the Lords in 2021, having retired from the Disney chair in 2004. An only child, Renfrew was born in Stockton-on-Tees and shortly afterwards moved with his parents, Helena (nee Savage) and Archibald, to Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, where his father worked at ICI Plastics. His parents encouraged his interest in art and history, taking him to museums in Paris and Rome and to see megaliths in Spain, and he went to St Albans school on a scholarship. He did national service in Germany before gaining a first-class degree in archaeology and anthropology at St John\u2019s College, Cambridge (1962), having spent his first year studying natural sciences. As president of the Cambridge Union, he surprised fellow students by successfully inviting Lord Reith to speak. He co-directed excavations at Quanterness, Orkney (1972\u201374), and, in Greece, Saliagos (1964-65), Sitagroi (1968-70), Phylakopi (1974\u201377), and a long-running project on the Cycladic island of Keros. Keros had suffered extensive looting of small marble figurines redolent of works by Brancusi and Modigliani. The archaeologists decided the tiny island had been a central place for the Cyclades where around 2500BC people brought the broken carvings for ritual burial; a common theme of his excavations was resolving ways to identify and characterise shrines and religious behaviour. After publication of his book featuring a private collection of figurines, The Cycladic Spirit (1991), it emerged that many were looted, and he began his work countering the illicit antiquities trade, which he said damaged ancient sites and tainted artefacts, rendering both valueless. He was scathing of those museums and private collectors in Europe and North America whom, he charged, ignored the effects of their acquisitiveness on countries unable to protect their heritage, publishing an angry polemic, Loot, Legitimacy and Ownership, in 2000. He received many honours for his outstanding contributions to archaeology, including the Archaeological Institute of America\u2019s Bandelier award, the International Balzan prize and the European Science Foundation Latsis prize. He held many committee posts, among them as a trustee of the British Museum and a commissioner for English Heritage. He is survived by his wife, Jane (nee Ewbank), an archaeologist and botanist, whom he married in 1965, and their children, Helena, Alban and Magnus. \u2022 Andrew Colin Renfrew, Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn, archaeologist, born 25 July 1937; died 24 November 2024",

It is a political case being run against me. It is a minimal case that has been run up. Denmark is known as a very trustworthy legal society, but look what it has become.\u201d Watson has been in Greenland\u2019s prison, known as the Anstalten, since his arrest on 21 July by a dozen police officers while refuelling his ship, MV John Paul DeJoria. The police were acting on an Interpol red notice issued by Japan. Tokyo is seeking his extradition on charges of stopping a lawful business, trespass, damage to property and assault relating to the alleged boarding of the Japanese whaling ship Shonan Maru 2 in the Southern Ocean in February 2010. The charges carry a sentence of up to 15 years in jail. It is accepted by the prosecution that Watson, who has been involved in thwarting whalers for five decades, was not present at the time of the alleged crime. It is instead claimed that he was party to the decision by the activist Peter Bethune to board the vessel and throw a stink bomb on to its deck. The bomb\u2019s chemical components allegedly lightly injured a member of crew. Watson\u2019s defence disputes that this would be possible. Bethune was seized by the whalers at the time and given a two-year sentence, suspended for five years. As part of that sentence, he named Watson as a co-conspirator. On his release, Bethune signed an affidavit in which he claimed to have named Watson in order to get a reduced sentence. Watson\u2019s legal team argue that their client was not involved in the crime and that the charges are insufficiently serious for him to be extradited. In response, the prosecution told the court on Monday that the charges would probably lead to a one-year prison sentence under Danish law. The court was informed by Greenland\u2019s chief prosecutor, Mariam Khalil, that \u201cthe ministry of justice is gathering the final information from Japan to be able to make a decision\u201d on extradition. She added: \u201cThe Ministry of Justice has confirmed by email on 30 November 2024 that a final decision is expected within 14 days.\u201d The prosecution sought an extra 28 days of detention but the court gave leave for Watson to be detained until 18 December. Should the Danish government grant Japan\u2019s extradition request within the next two weeks, Watson would be able to appeal against that decision, opening up the potential for a lengthy legal tussle and further time in jail. The defence had also claimed that Watson\u2019s regular travels without disturbance since 2012 when the Interpol red notice was issued, including a visit to Monaco to see Prince Albert, illustrated that the decision to request 14 years after the alleged crime was politically motivated. Khalil said that the Japanese arrest warrant, on which the Interpol red notice was based, had been renewed 28 times since it was first issued in 2010. At the time of his arrest in Greenland, Watson had been on his way with a 32-strong crew to practise his decades-long policy of \u201cnon-violent aggression\u201d by intercepting a new Japanese whaling \u201cmothership\u201d, the \u00a57.5bn (\u00a339.4m) Kangei Maru. In an interview with the Guardian from a prison cell, Watson, who has two sons, aged three and eight, as well as a 44-year-old daughter, said he did not believe he would survive a spell in a Japanese prison should he be extradited. He said: \u201cI know that if I get sent to Japan, I\u2019m not coming home.\u201d The Japanese embassy in the UK and the Danish ministry of justice did not respond to a request for comment.",

Live and let live. Yet there is something monumental in the pardon granted by the outgoing US president, Joe Biden. Six months ago, he scored political points by denying he would pardon his son Hunter Biden. Now, with the election over, he has done so. The easy response is: what is new? President Gerald Ford pardoned his predecessor, Richard Nixon; Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother and other figures whose families had donated to the Democrats; Donald Trump pardoned his son-in-law\u2019s father and dodgy aides galore. No one doubts that, as president, Trump will pardon a number of outrageous figures \u2013 perhaps even the Capitol Hill rioters of 2021. We wait to see if this includes trying to pardon himself from various pending prosecutions (though he cannot extend these powers to cases brought at state level).

A decision was taken soon afterward that it would not resume on Sunday evening. It was hard to imagine any other outcome. Players from both teams were visibly distraught.

      "bodyText": "Before Edoardo Bove fell, it had seemed as though a disallowed goal was the most important thing in the world. Fiorentina and Inter were waiting for a VAR check to confirm whether the ball really had gone out as Denzel Dumfries set up Lautaro Mart\u00ednez to score in the 17th minute of their top-four clash. Players and coaches voiced their disagreement in the usual theatrical terms. And then, it did not matter at all. Bove had not involved himself in the discussion, waiting in the far half of the pitch. He dropped to a knee for a moment, presumed to be tying a shoelace, but in fact using his hands to steady himself on the turf. After standing back up, he took a handful of steps then collapsed beside Hakan Calhanoglu. A football match became an afterthought. Dumfries, the first to see what had happened, turned to the dugouts and cried for assistance. Perhaps it was his tone, or some other cue, but recognition of the urgency of the situation spread immediately. Players and staff ran in all directions: towards Bove, towards the ambulance, towards officials, towards each other. Simone Inzaghi, the Inter manager, lost his feet sprinting to help. Opponents who had quarrelled moments earlier now stood with arms around each other\u2019s shoulders, shielding Bove from view. The only yelling inside the Stadio Artemio Franchi was from a group of players who could not understand why the ambulance had not entered the pitch. The medical team was following protocol, leaving the vehicle in place while its crew rushed to tend to the player. Bove was swiftly placed on a stretcher and taken to the ambulance. He had suffered a cardiac arrest, and it has been widely reported that a defibrillator was used to restart his heart. Better news has followed. Bove was taken to the Careggi University Hospital, and a statement released by Fiorentina on Sunday evening said he \u201cwas treated on the pitch following a loss of consciousness during the Fiorentina v Inter match [and] is currently under sedation and is hospitalised in intensive care. \u201cThe Viola player arrived at the emergency department in stable hemodynamic conditions and initial cardiological and neurological tests have ruled out acute damage to the central nervous system and the cardio-respiratory system. Bove will be re-evaluated in the next 24 hrs.\u201d On Monday morning, Matteo Dovellini, journalist for the newspaper la Repubblica, reported that Bove had been extubated. \u201cHe is lucid and responding to questions,\u201d wrote Dovellini. \u201cThere is no cerebral or cardiac damage.\u201d Fiorentina posted later that Bove was \u201cawake, alert and oriented\u201d and that diagnostic tests were ongoing.

Only 22, Bove had looked set to make this a breakout season. A lifelong Roma fan and graduate of their academy, the midfielder made 45 appearances for the Giallorossi last season but was deemed expendable this summer as the club spent close to \u20ac100m rebuilding the first-team squad to fit the vision of new technical director Florent Ghisolfi. Bove moved on deadline day, Fiorentina agreeing to a year\u2019s loan with an obligation to make the deal permanent if certain performance criteria were met. Bove described his decision to join the Viola as \u201ca choice made by the heart, because it was born from seeing the project that the directors proposed to me and the warmth I felt when I met them. \u201cThe people of Florence also made me feel at home right away.

Australian businesses and households use gas, and there will be significant problems and hardship if there is not enough made available while they continue to rely on it.</p> <p>But from there things get more complicated. Not everyone with expertise agrees with the industry view that the answer is more extraction alone.</p> <p>Let\u2019s consider some facts not included in the gas industry-sponsored News Corp advertorial spread.</p> <p>Gas is basically methane \u2013 a potent fossil fuel that plays a significant role in driving the climate crisis. More than 20% of Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions come from extracting and burning it. If Australia\u2019s leaders are serious about addressing the climate crisis \u2013 as the gas industry and major political parties say they are \u2013 logic tells us that its use needs to be limited where possible.</p> <p>For obvious reasons, it can\u2019t just be cut off before the country is ready. Failure to supply enough gas to meet demand would probably reduce support for the energy transition and lead to a backlash and higher emissions in the long run. But the public deserves honesty about what the goal is and what the options are.</p> <p>Another fact about gas: we have far, far more of it than News Corp or the industry lets on. There is no gas shortage in Australia. More than 70% of what is extracted is turned into liquefied natural gas (LNG) and exported. Factor in the gas used by the export industry within Australia and that figure leaps to about 80%.</p> <p>Australian governments have released gas basins to companies and claimed relatively little back in return for the gift of these resources. The companies have done what companies do \u2013 sell the product for maximum profits, in this case mostly overseas. This has been a problem because, unlike Western Australia, the east coast has not required that a percentage of gas be set aside for domestic use. The result? Local gas prices \u2013 which were once cheap \u2013 increased sharply as the international market set the going rate. And regular talk of gas shortages.</p> <p>The Albanese government has made some steps to address these problems, including introducing a temporary price cap. It led to a double-digit price fall but Australians have still been paying at least three times what was considered normal. Unpicking these problems is not easy. Contracts are in place.

The Australian Energy Market Operator says the best way to address that is to rapidly install more renewable energy and batteries.</p> <p>Aemo says Australia will need more gas-fired capacity as coal closes and pushes towards running on 90% renewable energy, but will not necessarily need to burn more gas in the medium term. Peaking gas plants will <a href=\"https://aemo.com.au/-/media/files/major-publications/isp/2024/2024-integrated-system-plan-isp.pdf?la=en\">provide a backup supply, or \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d</a>, called on when cheaper and cleaner options \u2013 solar, wind, hydro, a much larger supply of batteries and a better transmission grid \u2013 are not enough to ensure supply.</p> <p>There is one other gas constituency not mentioned so far in what News Corp has billed as a \u201cweek-long series explaining the critical importance of stepping on the gas to head off a crisis\u201d \u2013 industrial users that rely on it for high-temperature industrial practices and don\u2019t yet have a viable alternative.</p> <p>But let\u2019s put this in perspective. According to the Grattan Institute, about two-thirds of the gas used in manufacturing is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/21/coalitions-gas-plan-would-help-fewer-than-1-of-manufacturing-workers-report-finds\">consumed at just 15 facilities that together employ about 10,000 people</a>. They use only a fraction of the gas that Australia draws from the ground and could be supported while gas use is cut elsewhere.</p> <p>Obviously, none of this is likely to appear in the News Corp papers while the gas industry is buying the splash. Equally obviously, its readers deserve to be told some basic facts. We\u2019ll learn a little more in the days ahead about how much respect the company has for the public \u2013 though I expect we already know.</p> <ul> <li><p>Adam Morton is Guardian Australia\u2019s climate and environment editor</p></li> </ul>",

Using more of it would increase bills, not cut them. The industry argues more supply will help bring down prices. Some experts say this is unlikely to be the case with gas, and that any change would be marginal, because the international market remains the price-setter and the cheap gas resources in Australia have largely already been tapped. New reservoirs are harder to reach and often require more expensive extraction and transportation methods. This is part of what is fuelling the campaign for support to help households go electric and get off using gas for cooking and heating \u2013 it is both good for the climate and, depending on how upfront costs are addressed, could help reduce cost-of-living pressures. On blackouts, the biggest threat to supply during last week\u2019s heatwaves were outages at ageing coal plants. The Australian Energy Market Operator says the best way to address that is to rapidly install more renewable energy and batteries. Aemo says Australia will need more gas-fired capacity as coal closes and pushes towards running on 90% renewable energy, but will not necessarily need to burn more gas in the medium term. Peaking gas plants will provide a backup supply, or \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d, called on when cheaper and cleaner options \u2013 solar, wind, hydro, a much larger supply of batteries and a better transmission grid \u2013 are not enough to ensure supply. There is one other gas constituency not mentioned so far in what News Corp has billed as a \u201cweek-long series explaining the critical importance of stepping on the gas to head off a crisis\u201d \u2013 industrial users that rely on it for high-temperature industrial practices and don\u2019t yet have a viable alternative. But let\u2019s put this in perspective. According to the Grattan Institute, about two-thirds of the gas used in manufacturing is consumed at just 15 facilities that together employ about 10,000 people. They use only a fraction of the gas that Australia draws from the ground and could be supported while gas use is cut elsewhere. Obviously, none of this is likely to appear in the News Corp papers while the gas industry is buying the splash. Equally obviously, its readers deserve to be told some basic facts. We\u2019ll learn a little more in the days ahead about how much respect the company has for the public \u2013 though I expect we already know.

Those are the results of the latest Guardian Essential poll of 1,123 voters, which found strong support for social media regulation, including two-thirds in favour of the under-16 age ban. After a legislative bonanza with parliament passing 45 government bills in its final week, Anthony Albanese nevertheless conceded that Labor needs to do more on the cost of living before the 2025 election. It would seem voters agreed, with 53% rating the government\u2019s performance as \u201cpoor\u201d on \u201cincreasing the amount of affordable housing\u201d, including 30% who said \u201cvery poor\u201d.

Last week the government and opposition passed a world-leading social media age ban for those aged 16 and under, despite concerns about its practical enforceability. When it came to regulation of platforms such as Meta and TikTok, respondents to the poll supported banning deepfake pornography (77%), deepfake political content such as bogus videos of politicians (76%), requiring platforms to remove dangerous and malicious content (75%) and requiring platforms to ensure users are over the age of 16 (67%). The social media age ban was most popular among over-55s (76% of who approved) and less so among 18- to 34-year-olds, of whom 55% approved. In a sign of appetite for even greater regulation, 70% wanted the government to require platforms to disclose how they decide what content users receive in their feeds. A majority (55%) wanted the government to \u201crequire platforms to carry news journalism and compensate media companies for their work\u201d \u2013 an important finding with an announcement expected this year to respond to Meta\u2019s halting of deals compensating media companies.

Nevertheless, a majority of respondents were in favour of laws restricting freedom of speech including: laws against hate speech and vilification (67%), defamation (68%), criminal protection against assault and bullying (73%), and privacy law including anti-doxing laws (76%).

      "bodyText": "Climate 200 has reported a surge in first-time donors in November off the back of a donation-matching campaign comparing the Coalition and Peter Dutton to the politics of Donald Trump. The funding aggregator claims to have raised $377,000 from 3,900 donations including 1,373 people who donated to it for the first time, the biggest wave of first-time supporters since it was launched in 2021. Meta\u2019s ad library reveals that the result was driven by a pledge to double donations given in the days after Trump\u2019s US election victory, with ads linking the Coalition to Trump on issues including access to abortion and questioning its commitment to net zero emissions by 2050. When some in the Coalition raised the issue of abortion, Dutton said there would be no change in the opposition\u2019s policy. Climate 200 raised $13m from 11,200 donors before the 2022 election, helping to elect six new independent MPs and the senator David Pocock, and to re-elect the MP Zali Steggall. According to its November 2024 donation statistics, Climate 200 raised $377,000 with an average donation size of $95 and the most common donation $30. Some 88% of donations were under $100 and 98% were under $500, it said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email In the days leading up to the US election, Climate 200\u2019s ads accused Dutton of thinking \u201cfossil-fuel-funded attack ads are enough to win back seats Liberals lost to pro-climate independents in the last election\u201d. They also highlighted the success of the independent Jacqui Scruby at the Pittwater byelection in New South Wales. After Trump\u2019s victory Climate 200 asked its supporters if they \u201cwant to feel different on our election night\u201d, in an ad illustrated by a split portrait with half of Trump\u2019s face and half of Dutton\u2019s. An ad with a similar image urged supporters to \u201clet Dutton know we won\u2019t stand for Trump\u2019s politics in Australia\u201d. Some ads used newspaper headline clippings with text warning that \u201cemboldened by Trump, extremists in the Coalition and anti-abortion activists are already working to undermine reproductive rights in Australia\u201d. Several ads quoted the Nationals senator Matt Canavan arguing that the US result meant that \u201cnet zero is dead\u201d, despite Dutton and the Coalition remaining committed to that medium-term target. From 13 to 22 November a series of ads promised \u201cone generous Climate 200 supporter is DOUBLING all donations made to Trump-proof Australian politics for the next 48 hours\u201d. In some ads posted from 18 November the donor was identified as \u201cJenna\u201d, a mother of two who \u201clived in the US through Trump\u2019s last term\u201d. \u201cNow, she\u2019s moving home, and she\u2019s determined to stop Trump-style extremism taking hold here,\u201d they said. In a statement provided by Climate 200, Jenna said she was \u201cterrified to see the same red-flags emerging in Australia\u201d. She said it felt \u201cfamiliar\u201d to see Coalition senators celebrating Trump\u2019s win while declaring net zero \u201cdead\u201d, as well as seeing \u201cDutton\u2019s campaign team reaching out to Republican strategists\u201d. Byron Fay, the executive director of Climate 200, said: \u201cPeter Dutton\u2019s relentless Trumpist negativity are serving to enhance the attractiveness of community independents and to drive voters away from the major parties.\u201d The funding aggregators ads also claimed that the major parties had done a deal on electoral reform \u201cto kill the independents movement\u201d. In fact in the last parliamentary fortnight Labor failed to pass its spending and donation caps after negotiations with the Coalition reached an impasse. The special minister of state, Don Farrell, has criticised teals for their fundraising and campaigns in excess of the proposed $800,000 spending cap per electorate. Labor has said Farrell will now spend summer seeking Greens and crossbench support for the bill.",

A pair of black cotton trousers with an elasticated waist, an oversized black T-shirt made from fine merino wool and a high-necked, thick cotton jumper with a half zip at the collar.</p> <p>But when I went to pack for a month-long research trip, the sight of the outfit made me feel quite nauseous. It conjured memories of feeling sticky while trying to sleep on planes and hauling my heavy suitcase on to trains while hot and exhausted. It was time to change it up. I swapped it for an oversized pair of pleat-front pants (still made from cotton), a well-worn, long-sleeve cotton T-shirt and a vintage men\u2019s alpaca blazer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/nov/12/layered-outfit-guide-spring-fashion-layer-clothes-how-to\">Four seasons in one day: how to layer your outfits for spring dressing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It got me thinking about the art of dressing for travel. After speaking to several fashion industry professionals about their long-haul attire, the consensus seems to be: loose silhouettes and layers made from natural fibres to help your body\u2019s temperature regulate. Bonus points for pieces that are easy to use as a blanket or fold up into a pillow and for comfy shoes you can slip on and off.</p> <h2>\u2018Rummaging through your luggage isn\u2019t very chic\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cI once flew from a summery 36C Athens into a comically cold and blustery 9C London,\u201d says the Sydney stylist Thomas Townsend. \u201cRummaging through your luggage outside the airport as you wait for your car isn\u2019t very chic \u2013 take it from me.\u201d</p>    <p>Since then he\u2019s started checking his destination temperature and picking footwear for when he lands too. If it\u2019s a casual arrival he\u2019ll wear a pair of Birkenstock clogs but, if he has a commute to his hotel or is heading straight to a meeting, he opts for leather loafers.</p> <p>Planning aside, he thinks \u201cpeople should have fun with their looks at the airport\u201d. His preferred plane outfit is a pair of relaxed, grey cotton shorts with a matching boxy hoodie. \u201cI wear this look with an oversized double-breasted woven blazer, a cap and a pair of black Wayfarer-style sunglasses,\u201d he says. The oversized blazer comes in handy as a blanket during cold flights and can be scrunched into a makeshift pillow if needed.</p> <h2>\u2018I try to wear silk\u2019</h2> <p>Jewellery designer Morgan Lang\u2019s go-to plane outfit consists of a silk or cotton tee and a silk variation on sweatpants with an elastic waist and elastic ankles so they don\u2019t drag when she uses the bathroom.</p> <p>\u201cI always try to wear silk when I travel,\u201d she says. Silk has soothing properties against the skin and helps moderate temperature, making it a good option for time spent in dry environments.</p> <p>Inside her shoes (the largest pair she\u2019s bringing, to save on suitcase space) she wears thin socks. In case it\u2019s a particularly cold flight, she brings a thicker pair that she can pull on over the top.</p> <p>She finishes the look with a warmer layer like a cotton sweatshirt or a wool jumper. \u201cBecause you never really know the temperature of the plane, it\u2019s all about layers,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Ever the forward planner, Lang always packs her hand luggage mindfully. \u201cI\u2019m always thinking, what if my bag didn\u2019t arrive?\u201d To avoid being stranded with nothing to wear, she travels with at least one look that\u2019s suitable for meetings, and her workout clothes. \u201cAfter a long flight my favourite thing to do is go for a run, explore the city and get my body moving again,\u201d she says.</p> <h2>\u2018Never a jacket, never a belt\u2019</h2>    <p>When the Sydney-based photographer Ryan Cullen flies, he prioritises ease. \u201cNever a jacket, never a belt, never an item that needs to be taken off and put through security,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/nov/20/fast-fashion-outfits-temu-shein\">\u2018Quite dodgy\u2019: what kind of outfit does $80 buy at Temu and Shein?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He opts for jeans, a crew-neck lightweight sweater in navy or black and soft-soled leather moccasins. \u201cThey\u2019re essentially a leather sock,\u201d he says of the shoes, \u201cwhich is why I wear them religiously on flights. They\u2019re so comfortable, even for the longest hauls.\u201d</p> <p>He takes arriving fresh at his destination seriously, \u201cdespite running the risk of being perceived as a little unhinged\u201d. To achieve this, once he\u2019s onboard he puts on a <a href=\"https://humidiflyer.com/\">Humidiflyer</a> mask (a personal humidifier designed for air travel that prevents you from breathing the dry plane air) and covers his entire face with a scarf. \u201cBetween this magic duo and the natural fibres I wear, I find my body maintains the perfect temperature\u201d, he says.</p> <h2>\u2018If I bring too many things, something will get left\u2019</h2>    <p>Chloe Naughton likes to keep things simple when dressing for a flight. \u201cLess is always more for me,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The Melbourne-based producer wears a \u201ctried-and-tested uniform\u201d of straight-leg, high-waisted cotton jeans with sneakers, a fine merino wool jumper and a scarf or throw. The woollen pieces are perfect for flights because they are \u201cwarm, compact, breathable and easily fit into changing temperatures,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Depending on the weather at her destination she will adjust her base layer: a singlet if she\u2019s heading into heat or humidity, or a wool skivvy if the destination is cold.</p> <p>After the heartbreak of leaving a coat on a flight a few years ago, she packs outerwear in her checked luggage. \u201cWhen I head to London for Christmas this year, I\u2019ll retrieve my winter coat once I\u2019ve landed,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I bring too many things with me, something will get left behind.\u201d</p>",

But when I went to pack for a month-long research trip, the sight of the outfit made me feel quite nauseous. It conjured memories of feeling sticky while trying to sleep on planes and hauling my heavy suitcase on to trains while hot and exhausted. It was time to change it up. I swapped it for an oversized pair of pleat-front pants (still made from cotton), a well-worn, long-sleeve cotton T-shirt and a vintage men\u2019s alpaca blazer. It got me thinking about the art of dressing for travel. After speaking to several fashion industry professionals about their long-haul attire, the consensus seems to be: loose silhouettes and layers made from natural fibres to help your body\u2019s temperature regulate. Bonus points for pieces that are easy to use as a blanket or fold up into a pillow and for comfy shoes you can slip on and off. \u2018Rummaging through your luggage isn\u2019t very chic\u2019 \u201cI once flew from a summery 36C Athens into a comically cold and blustery 9C London,\u201d says the Sydney stylist Thomas Townsend. \u201cRummaging through your luggage outside the airport as you wait for your car isn\u2019t very chic \u2013 take it from me.\u201d Since then he\u2019s started checking his destination temperature and picking footwear for when he lands too. If it\u2019s a casual arrival he\u2019ll wear a pair of Birkenstock clogs but, if he has a commute to his hotel or is heading straight to a meeting, he opts for leather loafers. Planning aside, he thinks \u201cpeople should have fun with their looks at the airport\u201d. His preferred plane outfit is a pair of relaxed, grey cotton shorts with a matching boxy hoodie. \u201cI wear this look with an oversized double-breasted woven blazer, a cap and a pair of black Wayfarer-style sunglasses,\u201d he says. The oversized blazer comes in handy as a blanket during cold flights and can be scrunched into a makeshift pillow if needed. \u2018I try to wear silk\u2019 Jewellery designer Morgan Lang\u2019s go-to plane outfit consists of a silk or cotton tee and a silk variation on sweatpants with an elastic waist and elastic ankles so they don\u2019t drag when she uses the bathroom. \u201cI always try to wear silk when I travel,\u201d she says. Silk has soothing properties against the skin and helps moderate temperature, making it a good option for time spent in dry environments. Inside her shoes (the largest pair she\u2019s bringing, to save on suitcase space) she wears thin socks. In case it\u2019s a particularly cold flight, she brings a thicker pair that she can pull on over the top. She finishes the look with a warmer layer like a cotton sweatshirt or a wool jumper. \u201cBecause you never really know the temperature of the plane, it\u2019s all about layers,\u201d she says. Ever the forward planner, Lang always packs her hand luggage mindfully. \u201cI\u2019m always thinking, what if my bag didn\u2019t arrive?\u201d To avoid being stranded with nothing to wear, she travels with at least one look that\u2019s suitable for meetings, and her workout clothes. \u201cAfter a long flight my favourite thing to do is go for a run, explore the city and get my body moving again,\u201d she says. \u2018Never a jacket, never a belt\u2019 When the Sydney-based photographer Ryan Cullen flies, he prioritises ease. \u201cNever a jacket, never a belt, never an item that needs to be taken off and put through security,\u201d he says. He opts for jeans, a crew-neck lightweight sweater in navy or black and soft-soled leather moccasins. \u201cThey\u2019re essentially a leather sock,\u201d he says of the shoes, \u201cwhich is why I wear them religiously on flights. They\u2019re so comfortable, even for the longest hauls.\u201d He takes arriving fresh at his destination seriously, \u201cdespite running the risk of being perceived as a little unhinged\u201d. To achieve this, once he\u2019s onboard he puts on a Humidiflyer mask (a personal humidifier designed for air travel that prevents you from breathing the dry plane air) and covers his entire face with a scarf. \u201cBetween this magic duo and the natural fibres I wear, I find my body maintains the perfect temperature\u201d, he says. \u2018If I bring too many things, something will get left\u2019 Chloe Naughton likes to keep things simple when dressing for a flight. \u201cLess is always more for me,\u201d she says. The Melbourne-based producer wears a \u201ctried-and-tested uniform\u201d of straight-leg, high-waisted cotton jeans with sneakers, a fine merino wool jumper and a scarf or throw. The woollen pieces are perfect for flights because they are \u201cwarm, compact, breathable and easily fit into changing temperatures,\u201d she says. Depending on the weather at her destination she will adjust her base layer: a singlet if she\u2019s heading into heat or humidity, or a wool skivvy if the destination is cold. After the heartbreak of leaving a coat on a flight a few years ago, she packs outerwear in her checked luggage. \u201cWhen I head to London for Christmas this year, I\u2019ll retrieve my winter coat once I\u2019ve landed,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I bring too many things with me, something will get left behind.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "I have many heritages: Chinese, Irish, Anglo and Japanese among them. I am a journalist. I grew up in the city but have lived in the country for 30 years. How should I define my identity? Rural life has colonised my writing life. But I would hazard a guess I am not fully accepted as rural in many circles. I am certainly not the mythical bush person of legend. My fascination lies exactly in that rural myth and why it still holds sway in the national imagination even though city life has long been the default culture. After all, the bush is a minority. Rural identity was the surprising factor for Rebecca Colvin, Frank Jotzo and Kelly Fielding, researchers from the Australian National University and the University of Queensland, as they set out to answer the question: \u201cIs Australia\u2019s urban-regional schism on climate reality or rhetoric?\u201d Published this month, their research attempted to measure the urban-regional divide on climate change and a range of social issues, including the friendliness of the relationship between Australia and China, the trustworthiness of universities and whether Australian values are in danger. The researchers could detect no statistically significant difference between the climate opinions of urban and regional Australians in the survey, which analysed a broadly representative sample of the Australian population. Rather, it found city and regional Australians\u2019 attitudes differed on one item: the perception of difference between urban and regional people. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Half of the quantitative survey respondents agreed that \u201ccity and country people are more different than they are similar\u201d. People living in inner and outer regional areas were almost twice as likely to agree with that statement than were people living in major cities. \u201cThese results indicate that there is a strong perception of difference between urban and regional people that is not borne out by actual measurement of urban and regional people\u2019s views,\u201d the authors found. It may be the case that because we think we are different, we are different. It\u2019s our perception that creates the difference. Or, as Colvin put it to me: \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily that the individual people are different as such, but we create different cultures and we tell stories about our differences, and that probably does lead to actual differences. \u201cBut it does seem to be much more from the perspective of the rural communities feeling that difference, rather than it being something that\u2019s particularly salient in the cities.\u201d We know there is a climate divide but in reality it all comes down to politics. The factors that made the difference on the climate divide were political party alignment, progressive or conservative political ideology and the frequency with which people consumed ABC or Sky News. These three elements were the most consistently significant variables predicting climate opinion rather than whether respondents lived in cities or regions. \u201cThat\u2019s what we keep finding,\u201d Colvin said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting a little bit boring actually, it\u2019s always politics.\u201d It has been a regular theme if you have watched the climate wars. The Abbott government\u2019s strategy to campaign against the Gillard government\u2019s carbon tax was politically successful in dampening conservative support for climate action because it welded the climate issue on to Labor. Climate science became a matter of who you voted for. In part, that is why we saw a portion of Coalition voters break away to support independents. But if this research is right, there may be a lot more common ground than first thought, as long as we can shove the politics to one side. Colvin thinks of it this way. In every community there is a range of views, from climate science denial at one end to kayaking to blockade coal ships on the other. It\u2019s the culture of the group that determines which particular view holds public sway. For example, I have often heard farmers who support renewables start their sentences with \u201cI am not a greenie but it makes sense to have a drought-proof income\u201d. That is a nod to the dominant culture of a conservative area or an attempt not to offend prevailing views. The divide is likely less about climate change as a policy issue, the authors found, and more about \u201ccultivating a social division that may reap political benefits\u201d, particularly for those with interests threatened by change to the status quo. There is a reason that the time-worn country rhetoric about \u201clatte-sippers\u201d and city-based \u201celites\u201d is repeated by some politicians.

Netflix is no doubt keen for the follow-up series to also reach stratospheric heights, queueing it up for a Boxing Day release.</p> <p>The story continues to focus on former gambling addict Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), who, having survived the previous games, returns for another bout, determined to unearth the truth behind the competition and the company that runs it.

The first does much of the heavy lifting, plot and context wise, and the second smashes it out of the park with grandiose spectacle. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet returns to the starring role as Paul Atreides, a messiah-like figure fighting for the Fremen tribe, facing off against foes such as Austin Butler\u2019s Feyd-Rautha, the creepy nephew of Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s mud-bathing despot Baron Harkonnen.

The show revolves around a fractured family brought together, at least in terms of physical proximity, by the disappearance of Jacqueline McKenzie\u2019s Sarah, presumed to have drowned in the ocean during an early morning swim. I love how Krawitz and cinematographer Hugh Miller bathe the frame in blue. An obvious choice, perhaps, given the show\u2019s connection to water, but it\u2019s also a colour that encourages contemplation and suits the drama\u2019s rich and moody vibes.</p> <h2>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</h2> <p><strong>Film, Italy, 1966 \u2013 out 17 December</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCN5JJY_wiA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WCN5JJY_wiA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Sergio Leone is one of cinema\u2019s most distinctive stylists, best known for spaghetti westerns.

Maika Monroe stars as a potentially clairvoyant FBI agent tasked with tracking down Cage\u2019s Satan-worshipping serial killer in a case involving a mysterious doll and a spate of murder-suicides. The film was a massive hit, partly because of a clever marketing campaign that withheld key details including Cage\u2019s appearance.

Thus, in director Nick Waterman\u2019s mawkish Christmas drama, there are reverential shots of gravy being served and plot elements incorporating the acquisition of ingredients, such as red wine (easier said than done when the chefs are in prison).

Hsu\u2019s take on an \u201cown worst enemy\u201d character feels fresh, and full of interesting contradictions.

      "bodyText": "Netflix Squid Game season 2 TV, South Korea, 2024 \u2013 out 26 December Squid Game was a smash-hit sensation nobody saw coming, although the dystopian survival tournament genre has many well-known precedents \u2013 from Battle Royale to The Hunger Games and Australia\u2019s own Turkey Shoot. Netflix is no doubt keen for the follow-up series to also reach stratospheric heights, queueing it up for a Boxing Day release. The story continues to focus on former gambling addict Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), who, having survived the previous games, returns for another bout, determined to unearth the truth behind the competition and the company that runs it. Season one transformed innocuous childhood games such as \u201cred light, green light\u201d into gnarly adult horror. What games will the second reinvent \u2013 hide and seek? Hopscotch? Musical chairs? Hot potato?! Dune: Part Two Film, US, 2024 \u2013 out 12 December Denis Villeneuve\u2019s two-part adaptation of Frank Herbert\u2019s seminal sci-fi novel is truly epic, as every critic and their dog noted. The first does much of the heavy lifting, plot and context wise, and the second smashes it out of the park with grandiose spectacle. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet returns to the starring role as Paul Atreides, a messiah-like figure fighting for the Fremen tribe, facing off against foes such as Austin Butler\u2019s Feyd-Rautha, the creepy nephew of Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s mud-bathing despot Baron Harkonnen. Villeneuve is stingy with the sandworm scenes, making us relish every one of them. Black Doves TV, UK, 2024 \u2013 out 5 December Billed by Netflix as \u201can early Christmas gift\u201d, this six-episode, London-set spy series pairs Keira Knightley with Ben Whishaw, as a British undercover agent and former assassin respectively. After the lover of Knightley\u2019s Helen Webb is killed, Whishaw\u2019s Sam is tasked with keeping her safe. Both characters become ensnared in a knotty plotline involving government conspiracies and good old-fashioned jiggery-pokery. Honourable mentions: Paper Dolls (TV, out now), That Christmas (film, 4 December), Churchill at War (TV, 4 December), Birdeater (film, 7 December), Spy (film, 8 December), No Good Deed (TV, 12 December), Carry On (film, 13 December), Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire (film, 26 December). Stan Significant Others TV, Australia, 2022 \u2013 out 19 December This six-part mystery-drama created by Tommy Murphy and directed by Tony Krawitz landed on the ABC in 2022 but I don\u2019t think it got the attention it deserves, so I\u2019m plugging it again here. The show revolves around a fractured family brought together, at least in terms of physical proximity, by the disappearance of Jacqueline McKenzie\u2019s Sarah, presumed to have drowned in the ocean during an early morning swim. I love how Krawitz and cinematographer Hugh Miller bathe the frame in blue. An obvious choice, perhaps, given the show\u2019s connection to water, but it\u2019s also a colour that encourages contemplation and suits the drama\u2019s rich and moody vibes. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly Film, Italy, 1966 \u2013 out 17 December Sergio Leone is one of cinema\u2019s most distinctive stylists, best known for spaghetti westerns. The Italian auteur directed several great films, with The Good, the Bad and the Ugly considered by many as the cream of the crop: a civil war-set kablamo of guns-a-blazin\u2019 action, tense drama and angry dialogue. The story follows three key characters played by Clint Eastwood (\u201cthe good\u201d), Lee Van Cleef (\u201cthe bad\u201d) and Eli Wallach (\u201cthe ugly\u201d), who famously face off in a sensationally great cemetery-set ending.

Prime Video The Sticky TV, 2024, Canada \u2013 out 6 December For years hordes of online maple syrup enthusiasts have been clamouring for a TV show about the \u201cGreat Canadian Maple Syrup Heist\u201d. All right, maybe not. This show is based on an amusing real-life crime story involving an elaborate plan to \u201csecretly drain the province of Quebec\u2019s strategic maple syrup reserve and then sell the illicit product\u201d. Margo Martindale leads the cast as maple farmer Ruth Landry who breaks bad, in a very sticky way. With memories of Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s terrible Pop-Tarts movie still lingering, now\u2019s the time for a rich, sweet, breakfast-themed palate cleanser. Longlegs Film, US, 2024 \u2013 out 10 December Nicolas Cage is virtually unrecognisable in this twisted blend of police procedural and gut-turning horror, his face melted like an extreme burns victim, his demeanour pure evil personified. So \u2026 good times! Maika Monroe stars as a potentially clairvoyant FBI agent tasked with tracking down Cage\u2019s Satan-worshipping serial killer in a case involving a mysterious doll and a spate of murder-suicides. The film was a massive hit, partly because of a clever marketing campaign that withheld key details including Cage\u2019s appearance. Longlegs is precisely the 31st best Nic Cage movie, according to an irrefutable series of metrics \u2013 developed by yours truly \u2013 known as \u201cThe Cage Gauge\u201d.

Amadeus Film, US, 1984 \u2013 out now Milo\u0161 Forman\u2019s film about Mozart (Tom Hulce) and the lesser known composer Antonio Salieri (F Murray Abraham) is far from a stuffy period piece; it\u2019s wonderfully splashy and ostentatious.

Daddy Issues TV, UK, 2024 \u2013 out 19 December Aimee Lou Wood, who was so warm and funny as Aimee in Sex Education, leads this comedy series as a hairdresser who becomes pregnant after a random hook-up and, desperate to keep her rental apartment, asks her father (David Morrissey) to move in with her.

Whiplash Film, US, 2014 \u2013 out 6 December Who could forget JK Simmons\u2019 performance as jazz instructor Terence \u201cnot quite my tempo!\u201d Fletcher? The genius of his wickedly entertaining stroke of vein-popping acting is to infuse the role with the fury of the drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket. Fletcher\u2019s the kind of man you can\u2019t tolerate in person but can\u2019t look away from on screen. He gives whiplash, indeed, to Miles Teller\u2019s protagonist Andrew, a drummer at a prestigious music school who rubs up against Fletcher\u2019s teaching style, which involves screaming loud enough to wake the dead. The characters are vividly formed and the drama crackles. Honourable mentions: Love Me season 1 (TV, 1 December), The World\u2019s Most Powerful Prince (TV, 2 December), Bluey Minisodes (TV, 8 December), The Forest (TV, 16 December), The Yearly With Charlie Pickering (TV, 18 December), Tracy: A Force of Nature (TV, 23 December), Doctor Who: Planet of the Dead (TV, 31 December). Binge How to Make Gravy Film, Australia, 2024 \u2013 out now Can songs really be adapted into feature-length films? As I discuss in my review of How to Make Gravy, which of course originated as a beloved ballad from Paul Kelly, the process of turning a song into a film \u201cinevitably treats the lyrics as a series of reference points, with an obvious temptation to be very visual and literal\u201d. Thus, in director Nick Waterman\u2019s mawkish Christmas drama, there are reverential shots of gravy being served and plot elements incorporating the acquisition of ingredients, such as red wine (easier said than done when the chefs are in prison). Daniel Henshall can be a wildly great actor (consult Acute Misfortune and Snowtown) but his performance, as the incarcerated protagonist Joe, is very much on his B side. Laid TV, US, 2024 \u2013 out 19 December So far I\u2019ve only watched the first episode of this US remake of Marieke Hardy and Kirsty Fisher\u2019s Australian show of the same name. But my appetite has very much been whet by this darkly funny series with a very entertaining lead performance from Stephanie Hsu. She plays Ruby, a woman who discovers several men she\u2019s slept with have died, leading her to believe everyone on her \u201csex timeline\u201d is at risk. The show establishes a good groove from its first scene, in which Ruby confronts a bank teller \u2013 who she had a brief sexual encounter with \u2013 and breaks the news that he may be dying. Hsu\u2019s take on an \u201cown worst enemy\u201d character feels fresh, and full of interesting contradictions. Ruby is highly strung in some ways, unusually carefree in others; she\u2019s charming and forthright but also anxious and insecure. Honourable mentions: Bookworm (film, 2 December), Call Me Ted (TV, 11 December), Dune: Part Two (film, 12 December), Godzilla x Kong: The Empire (film, 26 December). Disney+ Skeleton Crew TV, US, 2024 \u2013 out 3 December No one can keep track of the Star Wars universe any more, except perhaps its most devoted appreciators. The official synopsis of this family-friendly series describes it as a \u201cjourney of four kids who make a mysterious discovery on their seemingly safe home planet, then get lost in a strange galaxy\u201d. In this galaxy they meet Jude Law\u2019s enigmatic Jod Na Nawood, who pledges to help them find their way home. The trailer includes Law reciting lines such as \u201cWe have to move fast!\u201d and \u201cA crew of murderous pirates is coming\u201d. Yawn. I mean: how exciting! Dream Productions TV, US, 2024 \u2013 out 11 December Chronologically based between Inside Out and Inside Out 2, this short, snackable, four-episode series (with a cumulative running time of 82 minutes) extends Pixar\u2019s beloved franchise about lil characters who work inside the mind of a girl named Riley, literally managing her emotions. Dream Productions has a fun twist, focusing on the construction of Riley\u2019s dreams, which are produced by an acclaimed director (the voice of Paula Pell). Honourable mentions: Sugarcane (film, 10 December), Elton John: Never Too Late (film, 13 December), Blink (film, 17 December), What If \u2026 ? season 3 (TV, 22 December). Apple TV+ Fly Me to the Moon Film, US, 2024 \u2013 out 6 December The makers of this Nasa-themed, 60s-set romantic comedy obviously intended to woo us with the sheer charm of its two lead actors: Channing Tatum and Scarlett Johansson. They play, respectively, the launch director at the Kennedy Space Center and a marketing executive brought on to rebrand the space program and \u201csell the moon\u201d to the general public. The film has generated a mixed response from critics: Peter Bradshaw describes it as \u201crelentlessly mediocre and misjudged\u201d while Variety\u2019s Peter Debruge calls it a \u201csmarter-than-it-sounds\u201d crowd-pleaser \u201cof the Rock Hudson/Doris Day variety\u201d. Honourable mentions: Wonder Pets: In the City (TV, 13 December), The Secret Lives of Animals (TV, 18 December).",

      "body": "<p>The meaning of <em>Der Klassiker</em> has changed significantly down the years. Having been a zenith fixture of Bayern Munich v current challenger of substance in the past, it is now set in stone in the post-Klopp years as the <em>Rekordmeister</em> v Borussia Dortmund, that branding remaining even with BVB having largely morphed from genuine challenger to most frequent irritant.</p> \n<p>There is a comforting regularity to it. The opener in Dortmund as autumn turns to winter, the April return in Munich and, so often, the arena in which BVB dreams of bigger and better are turned to mulch. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/apr/08/bayern-munich-destruction-borussia-dortmund-der-klassiker\">5-0 at Allianz Arena</a> in spring 2019 which was done and dusted inside the first 20 minutes, holding BVB\u2019s title charge in check. Bayern\u2019s win here in 2020 in front of no fans, snuffing out any home hopes of the Bundesliga just days after the post-Covid resumption. This time last year, it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/nov/06/kane-the-instrument-of-vengeance-in-one-sided-rant-against-dortmund\">Harry Kane\u2019s hat-trick in his first </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/nov/06/kane-the-instrument-of-vengeance-in-one-sided-rant-against-dortmund\">Klassiker</a></em> that told Dortmund the longings for putting right their loss of the title on the final day of 2022-23 were not rooted in reality.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/02/edoardo-bove-cardiac-arrest-fiorentina-inter-milan-serie-a\">Edoardo Bove\u2019s collapse gives a new lesson on what really matters in life | Nicky Bandini</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This time, it felt as if this was a spectacle anchored in the present, a recognition of where everyone is really at. Nuri Sahin\u2019s approach suggested as much as Dortmund defended with surprising poise, scored a sublime breakaway goal magnificently finished by Jamie Gittens, and got to five minutes from the end of normal time with a potential win still in their hands.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/30/borussia-dortmund-bayern-munich-der-klassiker-bundesliga-match-report\">Jamal Musiala\u2019s equaliser for Bayern </a>\u2013 more of which shortly \u2013 secured a 1-1 draw, put an end to BVB\u2019s 100% home record and preserved the leaders\u2019 unbeaten start to the Bundesliga season, but there was little scope for home deflation. This had been, after the 3-0 win at Dinamo Zagreb in midweek which put a stop to six successive away defeats in all competitions, Sahin\u2019s \u201cweek of answers\u201d, as Kicker\u2019s Patrick Kleinmann put it. For all the excitement and profile that this standout fixture continues to generate in the Bundesliga calendar, we have reached the point where Dortmund getting through it without humiliation feels like at least some sort of achievement, and not only in the context of this season\u2019s multiple setbacks and growing pains.</p> \n<p>\u201cNuri\u2019s plan worked perfectly,\u201d enthused BVB\u2019s managing director of sport, Lars Ricken, at full time. The plan was hatched weeks back, with Felix Nmecha\u2019s move back to a No 6 role one of the keys. If the 4-3-3 remains, now balance reigns. The way that Sahin\u2019s team manifested in Der Klassiker was entirely consistent with the current inching towards consistency and, eventually they hope, control. Whereas this showpiece is often lit up with abandon, this sober version of Dortmund enthused those around the club.</p> \n<p>Calm might well describe the visitors\u2019 reaction, too. With the greater possession, twice as many shots (14 to seven) and a dominant second half, one might imagine Bayern would be unhappy not to have notched a sixth straight Bundesliga win. But the surge to parity and the strength of the reaction, particularly at the end of a week containing a Champions League locking of horns with Paris Saint-Germain, was reason for satisfaction. The ability to cope in testing situations feels good, and Bayern had their reasons to doubt here. Kane\u2019s withdrawal with a thigh complaint just past the half-hour was unwelcome but opened the door to some invention on the fly.</p> \n<p>Vincent Kompany had already signalled his intention to experiment, giving a surprise start to Mathys Tel to Kane\u2019s left (a punt that didn\u2019t really work, as Bayern were kept at arm\u2019s length in that first period). Further solutions must be found with Kane expected to be out for a few weeks, beginning with Tuesday\u2019s huge DfB Pokal clash with Bayer Leverkusen. The answers in the second half here were the renewed Kingsley Coman, scurrying at the home team\u2019s well-set defence and adjusting the match\u2019s momentum, and Musiala, rising to head in from the sort of spot that a Kane, or formerly Robert Lewandowski, would be expected to inhabit.</p> \n<p>Yet the platform for that was Bayern\u2019s continued defensive improvement. Gittens\u2019 goal was the first they had conceded since the thrashing in Barcelona at the end of October, and the English winger\u2019s strike was such a work of brilliance that it could have reasonably been defined as an act of God for insurance purposes. Kompany has helped his team find a different gear in this relentless programme; a level of containment, with three of the four games before this one bringing 1-0 wins.</p> \n<p>Kompany continues to be full of surprises in Munich. In his post-match press conference he batted away BVB complaints that Bayern\u2019s leveller should not have stood, with Niklas S\u00fcle hit in the face by Leroy San\u00e9\u2019s free-kick and the defence waiting for a stoppage as the substitute Michael Olise laid on the goal for an unmarked Musiala Kompany effectively suggested the defender had tried to play the head injury rule and been unsuccessful. \u201cI hope he\u2019s OK,\u201d he said. \u201cI played football for 17 years. All the players know the rules and you can always try to use them. It\u2019s not an accusation or a criticism but in this passage of play, when so much is happening, you can\u2019t blow the whistle.\u201d</p> \n<p>That sort of canniness will need to continue as they legislate for important challenges without Kane. Kompany is also pragmatic enough \u2013 contrary to his image \u2013 to know that any green shoots of Dortmund recovery will have to be monitored, even if they remain a long way in Bayern\u2019s rearview mirror for now.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c3c9f983-2c24-4c62-8238-b5e926094b3d\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Heidenheim 0-4 Eintracht Frankfurt, Mainz 2-0 Hoffenheim,&nbsp;Dortmund 1-1 Bayern, Augsburg 1-0 VfL Bochum,&nbsp;Freiburg 3-1 Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, Leipzig 1-5 Wolfsburg, Union Berlin 1-2 Bayer Leverkusen, Werder Bremen 2-2 Stuttgart,&nbsp;St Pauli 3-1 Holstein Kiel.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Talking Points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 Leipzig\u2019s own dream of challenging Bayern is turning into a nightmare. They extended their winless run to five as they were hammered 5-1 at home by an improving Wolfsburg, never recovering from going two down in little over five minutes, with the goals conceded in the space of 75 seconds. On Sunday they announced that sporting director, Rouven Schr\u00f6der, would leave \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d but this is unconnected \u2013 he is moving across to calm stormy waters at Salzburg, and Marco Rose is still all at sea despite Schr\u00f6der\u2019s de facto replacement, Marcel Sch\u00e4fer, promising the coach will be there for Wednesday\u2019s DfB Pokal match against in-form Eintracht Frankfurt. It has been suggested that the RB supremo, Oliver Mintzlaff, might try to persuade the future employee J\u00fcrgen Klopp into the breach, though free agent Roger Schmidt (another former RB man) is perhaps a more realistic replacement.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Leverkusen are looking good ahead of their visit to Munich and it\u2019s mostly down to Patrik Schick. Despite a slew of injuries in the forward department they deserved their 2-1 win at Union Berlin, with Schick chesting in an impossibly stylish winner from substitute Florian Wirtz\u2019s cross. It was initially thought Schick had beaten club legend Ulf Kirsten\u2019s record for the highest amount of goals in his first 100 Leverkusen games (48), though club historian R\u00fcdiger Vollborn insisted to Bild he had only equalled it \u2013 with a 1993 Kirsten goal against Kaiserslautern originally (and incorrectly according to Kirsten) credited to Andreas Thom.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Three cheers for St Pauli who finally scored at home \u2013 three times in a vital win over fellow-promotees Holstein Kiel in Friday night\u2019s big match in a hot atmosphere to move themselves out of the bottom three, and to cut the visitors adrift to six points behind.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-table\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/tables/league/625\"> \n

      "bodyText": "The meaning of Der Klassiker has changed significantly down the years. Having been a zenith fixture of Bayern Munich v current challenger of substance in the past, it is now set in stone in the post-Klopp years as the Rekordmeister v Borussia Dortmund, that branding remaining even with BVB having largely morphed from genuine challenger to most frequent irritant. There is a comforting regularity to it. The opener in Dortmund as autumn turns to winter, the April return in Munich and, so often, the arena in which BVB dreams of bigger and better are turned to mulch. The 5-0 at Allianz Arena in spring 2019 which was done and dusted inside the first 20 minutes, holding BVB\u2019s title charge in check. Bayern\u2019s win here in 2020 in front of no fans, snuffing out any home hopes of the Bundesliga just days after the post-Covid resumption. This time last year, it was Harry Kane\u2019s hat-trick in his first Klassiker that told Dortmund the longings for putting right their loss of the title on the final day of 2022-23 were not rooted in reality. This time, it felt as if this was a spectacle anchored in the present, a recognition of where everyone is really at. Nuri Sahin\u2019s approach suggested as much as Dortmund defended with surprising poise, scored a sublime breakaway goal magnificently finished by Jamie Gittens, and got to five minutes from the end of normal time with a potential win still in their hands. Jamal Musiala\u2019s equaliser for Bayern \u2013 more of which shortly \u2013 secured a 1-1 draw, put an end to BVB\u2019s 100% home record and preserved the leaders\u2019 unbeaten start to the Bundesliga season, but there was little scope for home deflation. This had been, after the 3-0 win at Dinamo Zagreb in midweek which put a stop to six successive away defeats in all competitions, Sahin\u2019s \u201cweek of answers\u201d, as Kicker\u2019s Patrick Kleinmann put it. For all the excitement and profile that this standout fixture continues to generate in the Bundesliga calendar, we have reached the point where Dortmund getting through it without humiliation feels like at least some sort of achievement, and not only in the context of this season\u2019s multiple setbacks and growing pains. \u201cNuri\u2019s plan worked perfectly,\u201d enthused BVB\u2019s managing director of sport, Lars Ricken, at full time. The plan was hatched weeks back, with Felix Nmecha\u2019s move back to a No 6 role one of the keys. If the 4-3-3 remains, now balance reigns. The way that Sahin\u2019s team manifested in Der Klassiker was entirely consistent with the current inching towards consistency and, eventually they hope, control. Whereas this showpiece is often lit up with abandon, this sober version of Dortmund enthused those around the club. Calm might well describe the visitors\u2019 reaction, too. With the greater possession, twice as many shots (14 to seven) and a dominant second half, one might imagine Bayern would be unhappy not to have notched a sixth straight Bundesliga win. But the surge to parity and the strength of the reaction, particularly at the end of a week containing a Champions League locking of horns with Paris Saint-Germain, was reason for satisfaction. The ability to cope in testing situations feels good, and Bayern had their reasons to doubt here. Kane\u2019s withdrawal with a thigh complaint just past the half-hour was unwelcome but opened the door to some invention on the fly. Vincent Kompany had already signalled his intention to experiment, giving a surprise start to Mathys Tel to Kane\u2019s left (a punt that didn\u2019t really work, as Bayern were kept at arm\u2019s length in that first period). Further solutions must be found with Kane expected to be out for a few weeks, beginning with Tuesday\u2019s huge DfB Pokal clash with Bayer Leverkusen. The answers in the second half here were the renewed Kingsley Coman, scurrying at the home team\u2019s well-set defence and adjusting the match\u2019s momentum, and Musiala, rising to head in from the sort of spot that a Kane, or formerly Robert Lewandowski, would be expected to inhabit. Yet the platform for that was Bayern\u2019s continued defensive improvement. Gittens\u2019 goal was the first they had conceded since the thrashing in Barcelona at the end of October, and the English winger\u2019s strike was such a work of brilliance that it could have reasonably been defined as an act of God for insurance purposes. Kompany has helped his team find a different gear in this relentless programme; a level of containment, with three of the four games before this one bringing 1-0 wins. Kompany continues to be full of surprises in Munich. In his post-match press conference he batted away BVB complaints that Bayern\u2019s leveller should not have stood, with Niklas S\u00fcle hit in the face by Leroy San\u00e9\u2019s free-kick and the defence waiting for a stoppage as the substitute Michael Olise laid on the goal for an unmarked Musiala Kompany effectively suggested the defender had tried to play the head injury rule and been unsuccessful. \u201cI hope he\u2019s OK,\u201d he said. \u201cI played football for 17 years. All the players know the rules and you can always try to use them. It\u2019s not an accusation or a criticism but in this passage of play, when so much is happening, you can\u2019t blow the whistle.\u201d That sort of canniness will need to continue as they legislate for important challenges without Kane. Kompany is also pragmatic enough \u2013 contrary to his image \u2013 to know that any green shoots of Dortmund recovery will have to be monitored, even if they remain a long way in Bayern\u2019s rearview mirror for now. Talking Points \u2022 Leipzig\u2019s own dream of challenging Bayern is turning into a nightmare. They extended their winless run to five as they were hammered 5-1 at home by an improving Wolfsburg, never recovering from going two down in little over five minutes, with the goals conceded in the space of 75 seconds. On Sunday they announced that sporting director, Rouven Schr\u00f6der, would leave \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d but this is unconnected \u2013 he is moving across to calm stormy waters at Salzburg, and Marco Rose is still all at sea despite Schr\u00f6der\u2019s de facto replacement, Marcel Sch\u00e4fer, promising the coach will be there for Wednesday\u2019s DfB Pokal match against in-form Eintracht Frankfurt. It has been suggested that the RB supremo, Oliver Mintzlaff, might try to persuade the future employee J\u00fcrgen Klopp into the breach, though free agent Roger Schmidt (another former RB man) is perhaps a more realistic replacement. \u2022 Leverkusen are looking good ahead of their visit to Munich and it\u2019s mostly down to Patrik Schick. Despite a slew of injuries in the forward department they deserved their 2-1 win at Union Berlin, with Schick chesting in an impossibly stylish winner from substitute Florian Wirtz\u2019s cross. It was initially thought Schick had beaten club legend Ulf Kirsten\u2019s record for the highest amount of goals in his first 100 Leverkusen games (48), though club historian R\u00fcdiger Vollborn insisted to Bild he had only equalled it \u2013 with a 1993 Kirsten goal against Kaiserslautern originally (and incorrectly according to Kirsten) credited to Andreas Thom. \u2022 Three cheers for St Pauli who finally scored at home \u2013 three times in a vital win over fellow-promotees Holstein Kiel in Friday night\u2019s big match in a hot atmosphere to move themselves out of the bottom three, and to cut the visitors adrift to six points behind.",

His down-the-lens vent about \u201cmiddle-class women of a certain age\u201d who dared to complain was not only catastrophically ill advised, but also painfully unoriginal. Blaming women for holding you accountable is immoral, but it is also the PR equivalent of seasoning a burnt dish with vinegar: it only makes things worse. The BBC, always hypersensitive to scandal given the events of the past year or so, clearly saw the writing on the wall. Wallace has been swiftly ushered out of the MasterChef kitchen, leaving behind a legacy that\u2019s less about culinary expertise and more about what happens when unchecked hubris meets the cold reality of 2020s workplace norms. Wallace failed to understand a fact crucial to the career he once had: in this era, the format is more important than the presenters. Can he ever claw back from this mess? Well, stranger things have happened. And the formula for redemption is no secret: a sincere apology, demonstrable change and a long period of quiet reflection. There is the Russell Brand approach of praying (literally, in Brand\u2019s case) that a niche but lucrative YouTube community, or a new digital channel, picks up the wreckage. But let\u2019s be honest, in Wallace\u2019s case, that\u2019s not likely. The lesson is painfully clear: in an era when transparency and respect are non-negotiable, failing to adapt is a surefire way to cook your career. Wallace didn\u2019t just fail to read the room, he bulldozed through it in a rampage of cloaked misogyny, victim-blaming and the kind of reckless bravado that\u2019s no longer forgivable in the public eye. Gregg Wallace isn\u2019t just another fallen celebrity; he is a cautionary tale for an industry that thrives on the illusion of likability. Wallace\u2019s downfall isn\u2019t some Shakespearean tale of hubris; it\u2019s a mundane story of a man who couldn\u2019t comprehend the times, conditions and attitudes changing drastically around him; a frog who didn\u2019t notice that the water was getting warmer. In an era when respect, humility and adaptability are the ingredients for success or, at least, survivability, Wallace\u2019s story is a stark reminder that the heat in the kitchen of public opinion is hotter than ever, and not everyone is cut out to handle it \u2013 even, apparently, the man from MasterChef.

There\u2019s a belief that there\u2019s something inherently impolite or implicitly critical about a present designed to improve the appearance of the recipient. But the instinct to groom is universal, self-care is healthy and almost everyone likes to look their best.</p> <p>Provided one avoids specific \u201cproblem solvers\u201d, like anti-wrinkle cream, hair removal (or, indeed, its restoration) and anything related to cellulite, then there\u2019s no reason for anyone to take offence. Well-chosen beauty products make great stocking fillers, luxury presents and spare gifts for unexpected visitors, such as new partners or stray aunts. Plus, they often treat the recipient to something they\u2019d never justify buying for themselves.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/nov/12/best-self-care-gifts-ideas-christmas-presents-men-women\">The 20 best self-care gifts for Christmas, from slippers to essential oils to massagers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With that last point in mind, I usually follow a policy of getting the smallest thing for my budget, rather than trying to maximise it with stacks of bulky product. For example, an under \u00a320 allowance would probably be spent on a single luxury nail polish rather than a hamper of toiletries that may just gather dust in a regifting drawer. I\u2019d sooner blow a \u00a315 budget on one decadent bath foam than on a generic hand wash and lotion duo, and so on. It feels more special and indulgent.</p> <p>But that isn\u2019t to say beauty gifts can\u2019t be useful \u2013 the creamy suds of a single tablet of French soap can elevate everyday ablutions into moments of pure pleasure. So what follows is a wholly subjective list of frothy, fabulous and gratuitous fancies for all genders and ages. Think of them as the gift of guiltless frivolity.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>My favourite beauty gifts for Christmas 2024</strong></h2> <p>***</p> <h2>On-trend makeup bag</h2>    <p><strong>Nobody\u2019s Child</strong><strong> makeup bag, \u00a32</strong><strong>5<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.nobodyschild.com/products/leopard-print-makeup-bag-a243130brn\"><sub>nobodyschild.com</sub></a></p>    <p><strong>Damson Madder makeup bag, \u00a328</strong><br><a href=\"https://damsonmadder.com/products/leopard-print-make-up-bag?variant=44578684797156\"><sub>damsonmadder.com</sub></a></p> <p>Leopard is huge this season. A stylish makeup bag is an easy way to embrace it without going wild.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Subtle, long-lasting fragrance</h2>    <p><strong>DedCool Xtra Milk fragrance, \u00a324</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.spacenk.com/uk/fragrance/personal-fragrance/fragrance/xtra-milk-eau-de-parfum-MUK200049396.html\"><sub>spacenk.com</sub></a></p> <p>The perfect scent for people who think they hate perfume. Soft, intimate, musky and unobtrusive, its fragrance is barely discernible from an upmarket soap, only much longer lasting.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Freshly washed scent</h2>    <p><strong>Jones Road </strong><strong>fragrance rollerball in Shower</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>\u00a316</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.jonesroadbeauty.com/products/fragrance-rollerball-shower\"><sub>jonesroadbeauty.com</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://www.libertylondon.com/uk/fragrance-in-shower-rollerball-10ml-000828644.html\"><sub>libertylondon.com</sub></a></p> <p>Bobbi Brown\u2019s Jones Road has nailed the desires of low-maintenance, busy working women over 35. This just-washed scent is often sold out but is back for Christmas in a handy rollerball for on-the-go freshen-ups.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Glamorous soap blocks</h2>    <p><strong>L\u2019Occitane Bonne M\u00e8re rhubarb and basil soap, \u00a37.50</strong><br><a href=\"https://uk.loccitane.com/bonne-mere-rhubarb-and-basil-soap-25SA100RB21.html\"><sub>loccitane.com</sub></a><br><strong>\u00a39.50</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.strawberrynet.com/en-GB/l-occitane-bonne-mere-soap-rhubarb-basil-100g-3-5oz/267940\"><sub>strawberrynet.com</sub></a></p> <p>There is something intrinsically glamorous about bar soap. L\u2019Occitane\u2019s beautiful, creamy, fatty Marseille blocks are among my favourites. Use as intended, or pop an unwrapped bar in your clothes drawer to keep everything smelling wonderful.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Moisture for dry lips</h2>    <p><strong>Laneige candy cane lip mask, \u00a322</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/p/laneige-lip-sleeping-mask-candy-cane/15428495/\"><sub>cultbeauty.co.uk</sub></a><br><a href=\"https://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/product/laneigecandy-cane-lip-sleeping-mask-20g_R04363066/\"><sub>selfridges.com</sub></a></p> <p>A fun, festive-looking lip balm with serious Korean beauty credentials.

No brushes or expertise required. Works great for women, teens and men too.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Comfortable lip gloss</h2>    <p><strong>Lisa Eldridge Gloss Embrace lip gloss, \u00a320</strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.spacenk.com/uk/makeup/lips/lip-gloss/gloss-embrace-lip-gloss-MUK200048936.html\"><sub>spacenk.com</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://www.libertylondon.com/uk/gloss-embrace-lip-gloss-4.5ml-R545849006.html\"><sub>libertylondon.com</sub></a></p> <p>One of the very few lip glosses I can wear. No jammy stickiness or glued-on hair, just comfortable, pretty shine.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Spa treatment for feet</h2>    <p><strong>M&amp;S hydrating foot mask and socks set, \u00a38</strong><strong> </strong><br><a href=\"https://www.marksandspencer.com/hydrating-foot-mask-and-socks-set/p/hbp60683286\"><sub>marksandspencer.com</sub></a></p> <p>I swear by hydrating-gel socks to soften hard skin and keep feet looking their best through all seasons, but my usual generic versions from Amazon won\u2019t cut it as gifts. This aesthetically appealing M&amp;S set makes a ceremony of an unsexy but deeply effective treatment.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Bathroom glow-up</h2>    <p><strong>John Lewis fluted glass soap dispenser, \u00a312</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/john-lewis-fluted-glass-soap-dispenser-clear/p111839549\"><sub>johnlewis.com</sub></a></p> <p>I like a designer hand soap, but the price versus the volume you need to use makes it prohibitive. This elegant dispenser can be refilled with cheap washes to enhance a stylish bathroom.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Frizz-tamer</h2>    <p><strong>Larry King Flyaway kit, \u00a320</strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.libertylondon.com/uk/flyaway-kit-000750236.html#pos=4\"><sub>libertylondon.com</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/p/larry-king-haircare-flyaway-with-me-kit/13347506/\"><sub>cultbeauty.co.uk</sub></a></p> <p>Winter is dreadful for fine, flyaway and brittle hair. This handy kit (currently residing in my own handbag) is an instant frizz-tamer and adds non-greasy moisture to dry hair.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Protective salve</h2>    <p><strong>Violette FR Invisible Bandage, \u00a329</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.violettefr.com/en-gb/products/invisible-bandage#product-informations\"><sub>violettefr.com</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://ohmycream.co.uk/products/violette-fr-invisible-bandage-soothing-repairing-gel\"><sub>ohmycream.co.uk</sub></a></p> <p>I often use Christmas to gift functional, everyday items made luxurious. Violette FR\u2019s chic, French-girl aesthetic adds pizazz to this useful salve for chapped skin, minor burns, bites, grazes and irritations. Indispensable.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Recycling reminder</h2>    <p><strong>Dunelm</strong><strong> blush bathroom bin, \u00a326</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.dunelm.com/product/blush-recycling-bin-1000186124\"><sub>dunelm.com</sub></a></p> <p>A huge amount of recycling comes from the bathroom, but because fewer than half of us own a bathroom recycling bin, it gets tossed into general waste. It\u2019s not the sexiest gift, but I\u2019ve bought several of them for loved ones and they\u2019ve proved habit-changing.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Instant glow</h2>    <p><strong>Saie </strong><strong>Glowy Super Gel, \u00a322</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/p/saie-glowy-super-gel-30ml-various-shades/13321953/\"><sub>cultbeauty.co.uk</sub></a></p> <p>Makeup can be tricky to choose for others, but this glowy, transparent gel works on every skin tone, in low- or high-maintenance routines. Stroke on cheeks, limbs and clavicles for party season, then use as an extremely sheer, idiot-proof face tint in summer.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Wintry nail colour</h2>    <p><strong>Nailberry Le</strong><strong> Temps des Cerises, </strong><strong>\u00a316.50</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.nailberry.co.uk/collections/loxygene-12-free-of-chemicals/products/le-temps-des-cerises\"><sub>nailberry.co.uk</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/nailberry-loxygene-oxygenated-nail-lacquer/le-temps-des-cerises/p3789628\"><sub>johnlewis.com</sub></a></p> <p>No one does rich, wintry colour like Nailberry, and this shade in particular sums up the season. The beautiful, luxurious packaging makes it one of the few nail brands I ever give as a gift (Chanel and Dior are the others).</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Flattering blusher</h2>    <p><strong>Vieve Sunset Blush Balm in Strawberry, \u00a324</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.vievebeauty.com/products/sunset-blush-balm-strawb\"><sub>vievebeauty.com</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/p/vieve-sunset-blush-balm-15ml-various-shades/14218961/\"><sub>cultbeauty.co.uk</sub></a></p> <p>Rouge blusher is back, only this time it\u2019s sheer, fresh and impossible to get wrong. This pretty, lollipop-red balm adds a natural-looking flush that flatters everyone. No brush needed.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>My most used makeup brush</h2>    <p><strong>Saie The Base brush, \u00a321</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/p/saie-the-base-brush/14268565/\"><sub>cultbeauty.co.uk</sub></a></p> <p>Its high-quality, easy-to-apply and fairly priced makeup makes Saie one of my brands of 2024. The brushes are particularly good. This, for application of primer, foundation, creme blush or bronzer, is among my most used of the year.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Scent for hair and skin</h2>    <p><strong>Arkive No One Elsie hair and skin scent, \u00a330</strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://arkiveheadcare.com/products/no-one-elsie\"><sub>arkiveheadcare.com</sub></a></p> <p>When celebrity hairdresser and perfume nerd Adam Reed launched his hair products a couple of years ago, I practically begged him to bottle their scents and sell them as fragrances. I can\u2019t have been the only one, because here, at last, they are. The tomatoey No One Elsie is my favourite.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Fun shower foam</h2>    <p><strong>Sundae Gingerbread whipped shower foam, \u00a313</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.simplybe.co.uk/shop/p/zo962\"><sub>simplybe.co.uk</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://sundaebody.co.uk/products/gingerbread-foaming-body-wash\"><sub>sundaebody.co.uk</sub></a></p> <p>This warm, spicy, squirty-cream-style shower foam brings out my inner six-year-old, and I like it.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Ultra-moisturising body butter</h2>    <p><strong>Fenty Skin Butta Drop whipped oil body cream, </strong><strong>\u00a317</strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/fenty-skin-butta-drop-whipped-oil-body-cream-mini-10302783\"><sub>boots.com</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://fentybeauty.co.uk/products/butta-drop-mini-whipped-oil-body-cream-with-tropical-oils-shea-butter\"><sub>fentybeauty.co.uk</sub></a></p> <p>Don\u2019t sleep on Fenty\u2019s skincare \u2013 it\u2019s very, very good.

If you\u2019re reliant on mechanical hair straighteners and happy to blow the budget, treat your locks to this \u2013 super-fast straightening and a glossy, silky finish, courtesy of nothing more than hot air.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m surprised by how many people seem to believe beauty is a risky theme for gift giving. There\u2019s a belief that there\u2019s something inherently impolite or implicitly critical about a present designed to improve the appearance of the recipient. But the instinct to groom is universal, self-care is healthy and almost everyone likes to look their best. Provided one avoids specific \u201cproblem solvers\u201d, like anti-wrinkle cream, hair removal (or, indeed, its restoration) and anything related to cellulite, then there\u2019s no reason for anyone to take offence. Well-chosen beauty products make great stocking fillers, luxury presents and spare gifts for unexpected visitors, such as new partners or stray aunts. Plus, they often treat the recipient to something they\u2019d never justify buying for themselves. With that last point in mind, I usually follow a policy of getting the smallest thing for my budget, rather than trying to maximise it with stacks of bulky product. For example, an under \u00a320 allowance would probably be spent on a single luxury nail polish rather than a hamper of toiletries that may just gather dust in a regifting drawer. I\u2019d sooner blow a \u00a315 budget on one decadent bath foam than on a generic hand wash and lotion duo, and so on. It feels more special and indulgent. But that isn\u2019t to say beauty gifts can\u2019t be useful \u2013 the creamy suds of a single tablet of French soap can elevate everyday ablutions into moments of pure pleasure. So what follows is a wholly subjective list of frothy, fabulous and gratuitous fancies for all genders and ages. Think of them as the gift of guiltless frivolity. *** My favourite beauty gifts for Christmas 2024 *** On-trend makeup bag Nobody\u2019s Child makeup bag, \u00a325 nobodyschild.com Damson Madder makeup bag, \u00a328 damsonmadder.com Leopard is huge this season. A stylish makeup bag is an easy way to embrace it without going wild. *** Subtle, long-lasting fragrance DedCool Xtra Milk fragrance, \u00a324 spacenk.com The perfect scent for people who think they hate perfume. Soft, intimate, musky and unobtrusive, its fragrance is barely discernible from an upmarket soap, only much longer lasting. *** Freshly washed scent Jones Road fragrance rollerball in Shower, \u00a316 jonesroadbeauty.com libertylondon.com Bobbi Brown\u2019s Jones Road has nailed the desires of low-maintenance, busy working women over 35. This just-washed scent is often sold out but is back for Christmas in a handy rollerball for on-the-go freshen-ups. *** Glamorous soap blocks L\u2019Occitane Bonne M\u00e8re rhubarb and basil soap, \u00a37.50 loccitane.com \u00a39.50 strawberrynet.com There is something intrinsically glamorous about bar soap. L\u2019Occitane\u2019s beautiful, creamy, fatty Marseille blocks are among my favourites. Use as intended, or pop an unwrapped bar in your clothes drawer to keep everything smelling wonderful. *** Moisture for dry lips Laneige candy cane lip mask, \u00a322 cultbeauty.co.uk selfridges.com A fun, festive-looking lip balm with serious Korean beauty credentials. Apply whenever your lips look or feel dry. *** Light coverage Zara coloured moisturiser, \u00a317.99 zara.com An excellent recent buy, this is super-easy, no-makeup-makeup. No brushes or expertise required. Works great for women, teens and men too. *** Comfortable lip gloss Lisa Eldridge Gloss Embrace lip gloss, \u00a320 spacenk.com libertylondon.com One of the very few lip glosses I can wear. No jammy stickiness or glued-on hair, just comfortable, pretty shine. *** Spa treatment for feet M&amp;S hydrating foot mask and socks set, \u00a38 marksandspencer.com I swear by hydrating-gel socks to soften hard skin and keep feet looking their best through all seasons, but my usual generic versions from Amazon won\u2019t cut it as gifts. This aesthetically appealing M&amp;S set makes a ceremony of an unsexy but deeply effective treatment. *** Bathroom glow-up John Lewis fluted glass soap dispenser, \u00a312 johnlewis.com I like a designer hand soap, but the price versus the volume you need to use makes it prohibitive. This elegant dispenser can be refilled with cheap washes to enhance a stylish bathroom. *** Frizz-tamer Larry King Flyaway kit, \u00a320 libertylondon.com cultbeauty.co.uk Winter is dreadful for fine, flyaway and brittle hair. This handy kit (currently residing in my own handbag) is an instant frizz-tamer and adds non-greasy moisture to dry hair. *** Protective salve Violette FR Invisible Bandage, \u00a329 violettefr.com ohmycream.co.uk I often use Christmas to gift functional, everyday items made luxurious. Violette FR\u2019s chic, French-girl aesthetic adds pizazz to this useful salve for chapped skin, minor burns, bites, grazes and irritations. Indispensable. *** Recycling reminder Dunelm blush bathroom bin, \u00a326 dunelm.com A huge amount of recycling comes from the bathroom, but because fewer than half of us own a bathroom recycling bin, it gets tossed into general waste. It\u2019s not the sexiest gift, but I\u2019ve bought several of them for loved ones and they\u2019ve proved habit-changing. *** Instant glow Saie Glowy Super Gel, \u00a322 cultbeauty.co.uk Makeup can be tricky to choose for others, but this glowy, transparent gel works on every skin tone, in low- or high-maintenance routines. Stroke on cheeks, limbs and clavicles for party season, then use as an extremely sheer, idiot-proof face tint in summer. *** Wintry nail colour Nailberry Le Temps des Cerises, \u00a316.50 nailberry.co.uk johnlewis.com No one does rich, wintry colour like Nailberry, and this shade in particular sums up the season. The beautiful, luxurious packaging makes it one of the few nail brands I ever give as a gift (Chanel and Dior are the others). *** Flattering blusher Vieve Sunset Blush Balm in Strawberry, \u00a324 vievebeauty.com cultbeauty.co.uk Rouge blusher is back, only this time it\u2019s sheer, fresh and impossible to get wrong. This pretty, lollipop-red balm adds a natural-looking flush that flatters everyone. No brush needed. *** My most used makeup brush Saie The Base brush, \u00a321 cultbeauty.co.uk Its high-quality, easy-to-apply and fairly priced makeup makes Saie one of my brands of 2024. The brushes are particularly good. This, for application of primer, foundation, creme blush or bronzer, is among my most used of the year. *** Scent for hair and skin Arkive No One Elsie hair and skin scent, \u00a330 arkiveheadcare.com When celebrity hairdresser and perfume nerd Adam Reed launched his hair products a couple of years ago, I practically begged him to bottle their scents and sell them as fragrances. I can\u2019t have been the only one, because here, at last, they are. The tomatoey No One Elsie is my favourite. *** Fun shower foam Sundae Gingerbread whipped shower foam, \u00a313 simplybe.co.uk sundaebody.co.uk This warm, spicy, squirty-cream-style shower foam brings out my inner six-year-old, and I like it. *** Ultra-moisturising body butter Fenty Skin Butta Drop whipped oil body cream, \u00a317 boots.com fentybeauty.co.uk Don\u2019t sleep on Fenty\u2019s skincare \u2013 it\u2019s very, very good. This rich, luxurious ultra-moisturising butter is my special-occasion body cream of choice. It sinks into dry skin fast but leaves a sexy, flattering gleam. *** The best luxury beauty gifts *** Posh cleanser Elemis Pro-Collagen Green Fig cleansing balm, \u00a349 spacenk.com uk.elemis.com A beauty icon with good reason. Elemis\u2019s rich, sumptuous cleansing butter is a posh spa in a jar, and it rarely fails to thrill mums, sisters, wives, nans and pals. Massage on dry, add a drop of water to make it milky, then remove with the included cloth. *** Wet-to-dry hair straighteners Dyson Airstrait, \u00a3449.99 dyson.co.uk \u00a3399.99 johnlewis.com I\u2019m loth to admit it, but James Dyson has knocked this one out of the park.

      "body": "<p>Terry Griffiths, who has died aged 77 after suffering from dementia, became world snooker champion at his first attempt in 1979, just as the sport was transforming itself from a low-profile activity into a television attraction enjoyed by millions. A rookie pro from Llanelli who was new to TV audiences, he beat four leading players of the day, Perrie Mans, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jul/25/alex-higgins-obituary-snooker-champion\">Alex Higgins</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/nov/09/guardianobituaries.sport\">Eddie Charlton</a> and Dennis Taylor, to reach the summit of the sport.</p> <p>Griffiths had only turned professional the previous year, having realised that the game was beginning to provide more opportunities for fame and fortune or, at the least, a chance to earn a congenial living. Although the tournament circuit was not yet fully formed and it was far from easy, at that stage, to obtain the two club exhibition bookings a week at \u00a370 a night that were needed to stay on an even financial keel, he had decided to take the plunge.</p> <p>It was a bold move given Griffiths\u2019s responsibilities towards his wife, Annette, and their two young sons, Wayne and Darren, and he must have soon had some doubts when his first professional match, in late 1978 against Rex Williams in the UK Championship qualifying competition, provided an agonising setback, as an 8-2 lead turned into a 9-8 defeat.</p> <p>He travelled to the World Snooker Championship qualifying heats a few months later with no higher ambition than to earn enough money to pay off his car loan.</p>    <p>However, after qualifying for the main competition at the Crucible theatre in Sheffield he had a relatively comfortable 13-8 win on his debut against Mans, the 1978 runner-up, and then came through two contrasting epics. First he met the brilliance of Higgins with deadly counter punching, clearing the table to snatch several frames on pink or black from 60-odd behind and going through 13-12.

      "bodyText": "Terry Griffiths, who has died aged 77 after suffering from dementia, became world snooker champion at his first attempt in 1979, just as the sport was transforming itself from a low-profile activity into a television attraction enjoyed by millions. A rookie pro from Llanelli who was new to TV audiences, he beat four leading players of the day, Perrie Mans, Alex Higgins, Eddie Charlton and Dennis Taylor, to reach the summit of the sport. Griffiths had only turned professional the previous year, having realised that the game was beginning to provide more opportunities for fame and fortune or, at the least, a chance to earn a congenial living. Although the tournament circuit was not yet fully formed and it was far from easy, at that stage, to obtain the two club exhibition bookings a week at \u00a370 a night that were needed to stay on an even financial keel, he had decided to take the plunge. It was a bold move given Griffiths\u2019s responsibilities towards his wife, Annette, and their two young sons, Wayne and Darren, and he must have soon had some doubts when his first professional match, in late 1978 against Rex Williams in the UK Championship qualifying competition, provided an agonising setback, as an 8-2 lead turned into a 9-8 defeat. He travelled to the World Snooker Championship qualifying heats a few months later with no higher ambition than to earn enough money to pay off his car loan. However, after qualifying for the main competition at the Crucible theatre in Sheffield he had a relatively comfortable 13-8 win on his debut against Mans, the 1978 runner-up, and then came through two contrasting epics. First he met the brilliance of Higgins with deadly counter punching, clearing the table to snatch several frames on pink or black from 60-odd behind and going through 13-12. Then, in a semi-final against the dogged, resilient Charlton, he became embroiled in a war of attrition that required a final session of five and a half hours and a 1.40am finish before he was able to prevail 19-17. In the final against Taylor, Griffiths started the last day only 17-16 ahead but pulled away without further loss to win 24-16 and pocket the first prize of \u00a310,000. The veteran former world champion Fred Davis declared that, in view of Griffiths\u2019s lack of experience of long matches, \u201cTerry winning this has been the greatest achievement the game has ever known.\u201d Griffiths was born in Llanelli, south Wales, to Martin, a steelworker, and Ivy (nee Howells). Expelled from Llanelli grammar school for truancy and then transferred to a secondary modern, he left at 15 to work variously as a blacksmith\u2019s apprentice, miner, bus conductor, postman and insurance agent.

Sleeveless knits have been a fashion staple for the past few seasons, worn by celebrities including Harry Styles and Kate Middleton, thanks to their ability to add a joyful, nostalgic edge to any outfit, no matter how simple. Snug but sleek, they add warmth without bulk, making them particularly useful for the colder months. Timberland\u2019s V-neck wool blend gilet, which comes in blue or orange, would make an excellent gift for a female friend or partner. It nails the preppy trend but also offers timeless style, meaning it will be an instantly indispensable part of her wardrobe; one she\u2019ll reach for again and again over the coming years. Chunky hiking boots have also been one of the most popular trends of the past five years and are showing no sign of disappearing anytime soon. These boots may have been designed for walking but, recently, they\u2019ve been seen everywhere from the coolest parties to the school gates, due to their practicality and style. The new Timberland stone street lace-up platform hiker boots for women, available in brown, beige or black, combine the classic laces of a hiking boot with a chunky platform sole. They make the perfect finishing touch to any outfit, from jeans to a New Year\u2019s Eve party dress. Their versatility means they\u2019d be received just as gratefully by a teenage girl as her mother (or even grandmother). The boots are crafted with premium leather uppers, a breathable fabric lining made from at least 50% recycled plastic, and a supportive rubber lug outsole, built with 10% rubber sourced from farms committed to regenerative agriculture. This guarantees that their recipient can enjoy the comfort of their boots knowing they\u2019re kind to both the environment and their feet. For the men in your life, there\u2019s an equally diverse array of gifting options, any of which they\u2019d love to find under the tree at Christmas. The Euro hiker lace-up boots, in yellow, black, grey and brown, have been another Timberland footwear icon since the style debuted in 1988. Designed for comfort and durability, with premium leather, rubber lug outsoles, an Eva footbed and ReBotl lining, they also exude an effortless cool. A checked shirt is a wardrobe essential for men, and Timberland\u2019s buffalo shirt fits the bill perfectly. Available in four colourways, it features Solucell Air technology to efficiently trap warmth, while remaining lightweight. A built-in waterproof membrane ensures it dries quickly, made with 75% recycled plastic. For gifts your loved ones will cherish, Timberland has you covered.

      "body": "<p>Sallying forth into the mist and murk of a British winter can be daunting, but a few essentials make it easier: a sturdy coat, a warm hat and, of course, a comfortable pair of boots.</p> <p>But with so many styles to choose from, buying a pair of boots can be something of a rabbit hole. Get it wrong and you could end up with blisters, no puddle protection and an increased likelihood of slipping on icy surfaces. Get it right and your boots will not only be suitable for stomping around in the wintry sludge, but also durable and stylish enough to wear for all occasions \u2013 all year round. So whether you need your boots for pacing city pavements, hiking in the countryside, or partying during the festive season, here\u2019s what to consider.</p> <p><strong>1 Are they comfortable?<br></strong>Buying a pair of boots that are comfortable may sound obvious, but a few hacks can help you find footwear that fits extra snugly.</p> <p>Firstly, it\u2019s important to know your size. It might sound like a no-brainer, but how often do we wear shoes that feel slightly <em>off</em>? This is most likely due to sizing. So book a shoe fitting to find out your exact size. Make sure you organise your fitting for the end of the day, as feet can swell up half a size during the day \u2013 so if your boots are comfy in the morning, they could end up feeling tight a few hours later.</p> <p>When it comes to dimensions, if your big toe touches the front toe cap when standing up straight, don\u2019t be afraid to go half \u2013 or even one size \u2013 bigger than your standard shoe size.</p> <p>And the interior of the boot also plays a big role in determining comfort. Seek out leather or fabric linings, which add breathability to the insides of the shoe. The ReBotl lining of Timberland\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.timberland.co.uk/en-gb/p/men-10029/newmarket-mid-lace-up-chukka-boot-for-men-in-dark-brown-TB0A6AZEEM4?utm_source=Guardian&amp;utm_medium=Partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Guardian_Website_Article\" rel=\"nofollow\">timeless newmarket mid lace-up chukka boots</a> is a perfect example, with the footwear also scoring top cushiness marks thanks to its clever OrthoLite foam insoles, which have antimicrobial function and a foot-friendly \u201cmoisture management system\u201d.</p> <p><strong>2 Are they waterproof \u2013 and will my feet stay dry?<br></strong>For a country that experiences roughly around 172 rainy days a year (well, that\u2019s what we saw in 2023), soggy toes are unavoidable for those with the wrong footwear.</p> <p>To prevent your feet from getting soaked, first look at the seams and stitching on the outside of the shoe. The fewer seams and stitches, the more waterproof the boot will be. Are the seams sealed? If so, they\u2019ll provide even more puddle protection.</p> <p>Next, examine the shoe\u2019s inside. A lining made from fleece or faux fur should help avoid getting your lower extremities wet. Sustainable synthetic materials such as PrimaLoft also work well. The Timberland <a href=\"https://www.timberland.co.uk/en-gb/p/men-10029/timberland-premium-6-inch-lace-up-waterproof-boot-for-men-in-yellow-TB110061713?utm_source=Guardian&amp;utm_medium=Partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Guardian_Website_Article\" rel=\"nofollow\">premium 6-inch lace-up waterproof boot</a> has 400g of PrimaLoft insulation tucked inside its stylish shell, ensuring your feet stay warm and dry.</p>    <p><strong>3 Will they keep my feet healthy and happy?<br></strong>Having been around since 7,000BC or 8,000BC, not many people know that shoes contain tech that\u2019s constantly evolving \u2013 just like a smartphone or electric cars \u2013 but one of the latest developments is anti-fatigue technology, which Timberland deploys in its premium 6-inch lace-up waterproof boot. Anti-fatigue technology uses spring-like materials in the insoles, which distribute forces evenly, helping to reduce tiredness in the feet. An inverted cone design and powerful arch support in the footbed (the soft mattress-like cushioning inside the shoe) absorbs shock and returns energy to the feet too.</p> <p>Meanwhile, arch-supporting steel shanks \u2013 the thin strip of steel placed between the insole and midsole of a boot \u2013 also help feet stay energised, without soreness.</p> <p><strong>4 Are they sustainable and an ethical purchase?<br></strong>The footwear industry has made massive strides in recent years. One innovation is ReBotl, a fabric invented by Timberland, which is made from non-biodegradable plastic bottles that have been recycled into special yarns, which are then woven into the fabric.

Imaginative collaborations with the likes of Off-White and Jimmy Choo mean Timberland\u2019s classic yellow boot (which has been rechannelled into its premium 6-inch lace-up waterproof boot) is still as cool as ever, something that was recently reaffirmed when Pharrell Williams released a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/cassellferere/2024/07/18/pharrell-williams-and-louis-vuitton-usher-timberland-boots-into-luxury/\" rel=\"nofollow\">capsule collection</a> devoted to Timberland for his Louis Vuitton fall-winter 2024 men\u2019s show in Paris.

Many businesses that operate on the continent have told UK clients that the difficulties of complying with new rules have forced them to seek similar manufactured goods from inside the eurozone.</p> <p>In France, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/02/french-pm-michel-barnier-risk-toppled-hostile-parliament\">the country faces political turmoil</a>, the 22nd month of decline in November was blamed on lower levels of new work from clients in domestic and international markets.</p> <p>German factory owners, who said they were also struggling to win orders within the eurozone, also reported that domestic political uncertainty after the collapse of the coalition led by the SPD\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/olaf-scholz\">Olaf Scholz</a> was another factor to hit business confidence in November.</p>",

In the eurozone, Germany recorded the fastest drop in output, Italy\u2019s factory sector shrank at the fastest rate in a year, while France recorded the steepest contraction in 10 months. Dr Cyrus de la Rubia, the chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said: \u201cThese numbers look terrible. It\u2019s like the eurozone\u2019s manufacturing recession is never going to end. As new orders fell fast and at an accelerated pace, there\u2019s no sign of a recovery any time soon.\u201d Analysts said the situation in the UK was proving difficult for factories as difficulties abroad, including holdups in US ports and supply blockages in the Middle East were made worse by the prospect of increased staffing costs in Labour\u2019s first budget. Reeves, who has put a rejuvenation of economic growth at the top of her agenda, raised employer national insurance and increased the national minimum wage above the rate of inflation from next April, heaping further costs on manufacturers at a challenging time for the sector, analysts said. Rob Dobson, a director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said a combination of the conflict in the Middle East, port disruptions and extra border regulation had forced up the cost of components and raw materials. \u201cWith recent budget announcements on labour costs and employer national insurance likely to raise costs further in 2025, and geopolitical tensions heating up notably around the threat of increased global protectionism, manufacturers are left facing an environment of high costs, low demand and raised uncertainty for the foreseeable future,\u201d he said. Chris Barlow, the head of manufacturing at the accountants MHA, the UK arm of Baker Tilly international, said the PMI suggested \u201cthe sector is facing a near perfect storm of challenges ranging from the fallout of the budget, a weakened economic outlook for the UK and EU for 2025 and a new US administration introducing potentially damaging new tariffs.\u201d The CBI and Institute of Directors said at the weekend that business confidence had declined after the budget. Dobson said the climate for exports remained bleak, as weaker demand from the US, China and the EU led to a further drop in new business. Brexit delays at UK ports have hit smaller businesses especially hard. Many businesses that operate on the continent have told UK clients that the difficulties of complying with new rules have forced them to seek similar manufactured goods from inside the eurozone. In France, as the country faces political turmoil, the 22nd month of decline in November was blamed on lower levels of new work from clients in domestic and international markets. German factory owners, who said they were also struggling to win orders within the eurozone, also reported that domestic political uncertainty after the collapse of the coalition led by the SPD\u2019s Olaf Scholz was another factor to hit business confidence in November.",

In a letter from Republican House leadership to the EPA administrator Michael Regan, Republicans trained their sights on the agency\u2019s scientific integrity policies that are designed to insulate scientists and research from political interference. Meanwhile, the incoming chair of the Senate environmental committee in a hearing last week promised to target portions of new PFAS regulations put in place over the last year, a top priority for Trump\u2019s chemical and water utility industry allies. The Republican House committee on oversight and accountability chair, James Comer, charged in his letter that scientific integrity policies would be used by EPA scientists to \u201chamstring the incoming Trump administration\u2019s ability to implement their own executive agendas\u201d. The Republicans promptly moving to shred the integrity policies \u2013 which critics say were weak to begin with \u2013 demonstrates how party officials are \u201cbending over backwards\u201d to assist Trump in attacking career servants, said Jeff Ruch, a former EPA official now with the Public Employees Environmental Responsibility non-profit. \u201cThey want to clear out all potential obstacles,\u201d Ruch said.

Still, Comer stated that the policies exist to stop Trump by \u201cenabling career bureaucrats who favor one set of scientific viewpoints to undermine politically accountable agency leaders who seek to base agency actions on differing science\u201d. Comer ordered the EPA\u2019s Regan to turn over reams of documents detailing the policies and their application. Ruch said the attack points to two certainties: a stepped-up attack on agency scientists who contradict Trump in the second administration, and a crackdown on research produced by federal scientists. \u201cThere will be blood,\u201d Ruch added. Meanwhile, Senator Shelley Moore Capito, the incoming chair of the Senate committee on environment and public works, took aim at strong PFAS limits during a recent hearing.

      "body": "<p>In late 2016, soon after Donald Trump was elected to his first White House term, many women were diligently knitting pink \u201cpussy\u201d hats to wear at a huge march where they protested against the election of a man who had recently boasted that he would \u201cgrab\u201d women.</p> <p>There were other protests too. And across much of non-Trump-voting America, there was a sense of activism and engagement amid the shock of a Trump victory as many ordinary Americans galvanized themselves for what turned out to be one of the most chaotic presidencies in US history.</p> <p>Eight years later, the response of many centrist and left-leaning Americans to a Trump second term has been more muted. For many anti-Trump voters \u2013 and even some institutions \u2013 the return of Trump prompts a feeling of just wanting to ignore it all, including politics more broadly, and focus their energy elsewhere.</p> <p>In New York City, residents were once shocked that one of their own \u2013 Donald Trump, a man once close to Democratic power brokers in the city \u2013 had been elected, as a Republican, over Hillary Clinton. In the aftermath of November\u2019s shock national election, they are more apt to say, \u201cWell, we got whipped,\u201d and move on to other topics.</p> <p>The left-leaning media outlet MSNBC has lost 47% of its audience since election day, according to Nielsen Media Research, while the Los Angeles Times and especially the Washington Post saw subscribers flee by the hundreds of thousands after the billionaire owners of each paper chose at the last minute not to make a presidential endorsement.</p> <p>After a year of intense energy, propelled by political events including two Trump assassination attempts and Joe Biden stepping down from his campaign, the mood in New York has deflated: call it the great tune-out of late 2024.</p> <p>It is, said Sonia Ossorio, executive director of the National Organization for Women NYC, \u201ca coping method\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWomen\u2019s relationship to politics is like a bad romance: you call a friend to remind you how toxic it is,\u201d Ossorio said. \u201cComing to terms with the election and feeling a sense of instability about the future is personal right now, and people feel drained. It will take time and needed collective reflection to regroup.\u201d</p> <p>In New York\u2019s Washington Square Park, the site of 2016 anti-Trump protests that segued seamlessly into protests for #MeToo, Black Lives Matter, the overturning of Roe v Wade, Ukraine, Gaza and more, today there\u2019s almost no overt sign of resistance to Trump 2.</p>    <p>\u201cFor me it\u2019s an exhaustion,\u201d said Josh Marcus, a 39-year-old tech worker from El Paso, Texas, who was visiting the park with his partner, Marisha Hicks, a stay-at-home mother. The pair had come on vacation to gauge whether it might be time to move back to New York, in part to leave Texas politics behind them.</p> <p>\u201cWe went from disappointment that Biden was staying in,\u201d Marcus said, which changed when \u201che dropped out, Kamala came in and we felt a little bit better and she had a chance. But it was the complete opposite when it came to election day.\u201d</p> <p>Hicks, 45, said she was in a period of mourning. \u201cThe first time it happened I was in complete shock. This time, I almost expected it. So now I\u2019m personally focused on strategizing for the next four years.\u201d</p> <p>Both said too many losses to Trump \u2013 whether it be the Russia investigation, two impeachments, the failure of federal prosecutions and a felony conviction that appeared to do little to slow his momentum, if not the reverse \u2013 had led to a sense of inevitability.</p> <p>\u201cIt kept happening,\u201d said Marcus. \u201cWe\u2019d be thinking, \u2018Surely he\u2019s not going to get past this?\u2019 But then you just come to expect he will \u2013 and he did.\u201d</p> <p>Hicks said she had hopes that the non-politically motivated, those who did not vote at all, would now be the ones to start a revolution.</p> <p>\u201cI voted, but I can totally empathize with those who didn\u2019t. People are definitely giving Trump less attention. I certainly don\u2019t want to read his tweets this time around.\u201d</p> <p>Jaylen Alli, a street artist in the park, said he wasn\u2019t \u201ctoo big on politics in general. I don\u2019t waste my energy, my opinions or my thoughts on these kinds of constructs.

What would it take for one to succeed under Trump?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/2024/why-social-media-users-like-sharing-negative-news/\">A new study</a> from the Cambridge Judge Business School analyzed the relationship between traditional media and social media and found that news articles were being influenced by the latter to adopt a more negative tone.</p> <p>\u201cIn the aftermath of the US election, people might well feel overwhelmed by the volume of negative news they\u2019ve been exposed to,\u201d said the study\u2019s co-author Joe Watson.</p> <p>\u201cTaking a break could be important for many reasons, including to recover.\u201d</p> <p>Rosie Creamer, 54, a fashion shoot producer who was shopping for the Thanksgiving holiday on Sixth Avenue last week, said: \u201cI can\u2019t live my life in a future trip about what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d She added: \u201cTrump said he\u2019d build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. Did that happen? No.\u201d</p> <p>Creamer said she had started to pay less attention to media reports, and to take them with a bigger grain of salt. \u201cEvery time I read an article saying \u2018This could happen,\u2019 I stop reading. It also means it could not. So we\u2019ll see. I\u2019ll proceed accordingly.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel O\u2019Leary Carmona, executive director at Women\u2019s March, is planning another march on Washington in January for which the group, she says, has collected 100,000 signatures. At least 470,000 people were at the women\u2019s march in 2017, and more than 2 million were estimated to have joined protests around the world.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019re seeing a different reaction\u201d this time around, Carmona said. \u201cFolks are stunned and taking time to figure out what this means.\u201d</p> <p>One change could be for protest to become more localized, moving away from the kind of tightly choreographed marches that characterized Trump\u2019s first term. The protest group Indivisible has put out a new <a href=\"https://indivisible.org/resource/guide\">protest manual</a> that notes political power resides in many places.</p> <p>According to Carmona, the diffusion of protest from national to local is an option, but she believes marches remain useful \u2013 perhaps even more so now \u2013 because she believes they bring new people into movements. \u201cThey help tell our story and demonstrate our agenda to people where they are at. They bring the movement to the people, not the people to the movement.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that once folks are rested, they will be back in their lane, fighting,\u201d she added. \u201cBut not every intervention is for every person.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "In late 2016, soon after Donald Trump was elected to his first White House term, many women were diligently knitting pink \u201cpussy\u201d hats to wear at a huge march where they protested against the election of a man who had recently boasted that he would \u201cgrab\u201d women. There were other protests too. And across much of non-Trump-voting America, there was a sense of activism and engagement amid the shock of a Trump victory as many ordinary Americans galvanized themselves for what turned out to be one of the most chaotic presidencies in US history. Eight years later, the response of many centrist and left-leaning Americans to a Trump second term has been more muted. For many anti-Trump voters \u2013 and even some institutions \u2013 the return of Trump prompts a feeling of just wanting to ignore it all, including politics more broadly, and focus their energy elsewhere. In New York City, residents were once shocked that one of their own \u2013 Donald Trump, a man once close to Democratic power brokers in the city \u2013 had been elected, as a Republican, over Hillary Clinton. In the aftermath of November\u2019s shock national election, they are more apt to say, \u201cWell, we got whipped,\u201d and move on to other topics. The left-leaning media outlet MSNBC has lost 47% of its audience since election day, according to Nielsen Media Research, while the Los Angeles Times and especially the Washington Post saw subscribers flee by the hundreds of thousands after the billionaire owners of each paper chose at the last minute not to make a presidential endorsement. After a year of intense energy, propelled by political events including two Trump assassination attempts and Joe Biden stepping down from his campaign, the mood in New York has deflated: call it the great tune-out of late 2024. It is, said Sonia Ossorio, executive director of the National Organization for Women NYC, \u201ca coping method\u201d. \u201cWomen\u2019s relationship to politics is like a bad romance: you call a friend to remind you how toxic it is,\u201d Ossorio said. \u201cComing to terms with the election and feeling a sense of instability about the future is personal right now, and people feel drained. It will take time and needed collective reflection to regroup.\u201d In New York\u2019s Washington Square Park, the site of 2016 anti-Trump protests that segued seamlessly into protests for #MeToo, Black Lives Matter, the overturning of Roe v Wade, Ukraine, Gaza and more, today there\u2019s almost no overt sign of resistance to Trump 2. \u201cFor me it\u2019s an exhaustion,\u201d said Josh Marcus, a 39-year-old tech worker from El Paso, Texas, who was visiting the park with his partner, Marisha Hicks, a stay-at-home mother. The pair had come on vacation to gauge whether it might be time to move back to New York, in part to leave Texas politics behind them. \u201cWe went from disappointment that Biden was staying in,\u201d Marcus said, which changed when \u201che dropped out, Kamala came in and we felt a little bit better and she had a chance. But it was the complete opposite when it came to election day.\u201d Hicks, 45, said she was in a period of mourning. \u201cThe first time it happened I was in complete shock. This time, I almost expected it. So now I\u2019m personally focused on strategizing for the next four years.\u201d Both said too many losses to Trump \u2013 whether it be the Russia investigation, two impeachments, the failure of federal prosecutions and a felony conviction that appeared to do little to slow his momentum, if not the reverse \u2013 had led to a sense of inevitability. \u201cIt kept happening,\u201d said Marcus. \u201cWe\u2019d be thinking, \u2018Surely he\u2019s not going to get past this?\u2019 But then you just come to expect he will \u2013 and he did.\u201d Hicks said she had hopes that the non-politically motivated, those who did not vote at all, would now be the ones to start a revolution. \u201cI voted, but I can totally empathize with those who didn\u2019t. People are definitely giving Trump less attention. I certainly don\u2019t want to read his tweets this time around.\u201d Jaylen Alli, a street artist in the park, said he wasn\u2019t \u201ctoo big on politics in general. I don\u2019t waste my energy, my opinions or my thoughts on these kinds of constructs. Politics is a selfish machine that doesn\u2019t help the people.\u201d A new study from the Cambridge Judge Business School analyzed the relationship between traditional media and social media and found that news articles were being influenced by the latter to adopt a more negative tone. \u201cIn the aftermath of the US election, people might well feel overwhelmed by the volume of negative news they\u2019ve been exposed to,\u201d said the study\u2019s co-author Joe Watson. \u201cTaking a break could be important for many reasons, including to recover.\u201d Rosie Creamer, 54, a fashion shoot producer who was shopping for the Thanksgiving holiday on Sixth Avenue last week, said: \u201cI can\u2019t live my life in a future trip about what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d She added: \u201cTrump said he\u2019d build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. Did that happen? No.\u201d Creamer said she had started to pay less attention to media reports, and to take them with a bigger grain of salt. \u201cEvery time I read an article saying \u2018This could happen,\u2019 I stop reading. It also means it could not. So we\u2019ll see. I\u2019ll proceed accordingly.\u201d Rachel O\u2019Leary Carmona, executive director at Women\u2019s March, is planning another march on Washington in January for which the group, she says, has collected 100,000 signatures. At least 470,000 people were at the women\u2019s march in 2017, and more than 2 million were estimated to have joined protests around the world. \u201cI think we\u2019re seeing a different reaction\u201d this time around, Carmona said. \u201cFolks are stunned and taking time to figure out what this means.\u201d One change could be for protest to become more localized, moving away from the kind of tightly choreographed marches that characterized Trump\u2019s first term. The protest group Indivisible has put out a new protest manual that notes political power resides in many places. According to Carmona, the diffusion of protest from national to local is an option, but she believes marches remain useful \u2013 perhaps even more so now \u2013 because she believes they bring new people into movements. \u201cThey help tell our story and demonstrate our agenda to people where they are at. They bring the movement to the people, not the people to the movement. \u201cI\u2019m sure that once folks are rested, they will be back in their lane, fighting,\u201d she added. \u201cBut not every intervention is for every person.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Anti-opioid campaigners in the US have welcomed Donald Trump\u2019s threat to hit Mexico, China and Canada with increased trade tariffs if they do not curb the smuggling of the powerful drug driving the US opioid epidemic. Families and doctors grappling with a crisis that has claimed about 900,000 lives say the move may signal that a second Trump administration will finally get serious about tackling the flow of fentanyl into the US. But they also warn that much more needs to be done to reduce demand for opioids and to rein in the power of the pharmaceutical industry which created the epidemic. Trump said last week that he will issue an executive order on his return to the US presidency next month imposing a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada until their governments clamp down on the smuggling of fentanyl and other drugs into the US, and on people crossing the northern and southern borders illegally. The president-elect also said he will impose a 10% additional tariff on imports from China as the leading manufacturer of the precursor chemicals used by drug cartels to manufacture fentanyl, a highly potent synthetic opioid that is now the single largest cause of drug overdose deaths in the US. Ed Bisch, who lost his 18-year-old son Eddie to a prescription opioid overdose in 2001, said that tariffs are a sign that Trump \u201cmeans business\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that the threat of substantial tariffs will lead to major cooperation in reducing the fentanyl poisoning of America,\u201d he said. Bisch and other campaigners also say that some of Trump\u2019s cabinet choices may signal a greater engagement with the crisis by the next administration, particularly as Robert F Kennedy Jr, who is nominated as health secretary, was a heroin user and the vice-president-elect, JD Vance, wrote a bestselling book, Hillbilly Elegy, about growing up in a household and region hit by drug addiction. Trump campaigned in 2016 and again this year on commitments to tackle the opioid epidemic which has devastated regions of America in ways that are often unseen in other parts. The crisis dragged entire communities deeper into poverty, drove up crime and greater dependency on welfare, and tore families apart. Millions of children have been raised by their grandparents because the intervening generation was imprisoned, dead or in no condition to parent. In West Virginia, the state worst hit by the epidemic, nearly half of all grandparents are raising their grandchildren. The opioid crisis has also played an important part in undermining public confidence in government institutions and medical practice in parts of the US because the epidemic grew out of the pharmaceutical industry pushing the wide prescribing of narcotic pain killers from which drug makers made billions of dollars with the complicity of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The epidemic then evolved as illegal supplies of heroin and then fentanyl drove up the death toll. But critics say Trump failed to follow through on his campaign promises in 2016 and his next administration will be a test of how really committed is he is on the issue in the face of what is likely to be major pushback from the drug industry. As president in 2017, Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency. \u201cNo part of our society, not young or old, rich or poor, urban or rural has been spared this plague,\u201d he said at the time. But two years later, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) criticised the Trump administration for a lack of coordination of efforts and failing to fulfill a legal requirement to issue a national drug control strategy. Robert Kent, who served as general counsel for the White House office of national drug control policy under Joe Biden, credits Trump with declaring the epidemic an emergency and establishing an opioid commission that issued guidelines on how to combat the crisis. \u201cIn Trump\u2019s first term, he was the one who declared an opioid public health emergency, which is still in effect. The problem was there were no concrete actions taken specifically as a result. He didn\u2019t put significant new resources into it,\u201d he said. Kent said that the Biden administration put a greater emphasis on \u201charm reduction\u201d such as the provision of overdose antidotes and test strips allowing drug users to detect fentanyl. But he fears those may be in danger from Republicans who see such measures as enabling drug use. Andrew Kolodny, director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing and one of the first doctors to raise the alarm about the dangers of mass prescribing prescription painkillers, said harm reduction was necessary but did not get to the root causes of the epidemic. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard for Trump to do better than Biden did on opioids.

The DEA head, Anne Milgram, attributed that to the Biden administration\u2019s targeting of Mexican cartels and their supply chains. But Kent is cautious. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people running around because we\u2019ve seen a slight reduction in overdose deaths feeling like that\u2019s mission accomplished when we\u2019re only losing 93,000 people versus 111,000 a year.

Finance was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/23/cop29-agrees-13tn-climate-finance-deal-but-campaigners-brand-it-a-betrayal\">main sticking point</a> at the recent Cop29 climate talks, which ended in what negotiators <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/24/cop29-climate-finance-deal-criticised-travesty-justice-stage-managed\">described as a \u201ctravesty of justice\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Wewerinke-Singh said responsible states were required to make full reparation for the injury they had caused and this must be \u201cproportionate to historic contributions to the harm\u201d.

The <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement\">UN describes the Paris agreement</a>, which was passed in 2015, as a \u201clegally binding international treaty on climate change\u201d but states are free to set their own targets and policies in their nationally determined contributions.</p> <p>Germany and Saudi Arabia contended that they had no obligations beyond this treaty.</p> <p>Wiebke R\u00fcckert, the director for public international law for Germany, said the Paris agreement struck a \u201ccareful balance\u201d between legal and non-legal commitments and any attempts to limit it could seriously endanger the willingness of states to take part in political processes.</p> <p>But Zachary Phillips, counsel for Antigua and Barbuda, said compliance with the Paris agreement was \u201cnecessary but may not be sufficient\u201d to comply with customary international law including the obligation to prevent harm.</p> <p>Cynthia Houniuhi, the president of Pacific Island Students Fighting Climate Change, the youth group that sought the advisory opinion, said young people had looked to the Paris agreement as an instrument of hope when it was passed in 2015 but it had since been \u201chijacked\u201d by fossil fuel interests.</p> <p>\u201cNo good faith understanding of the UNFCCC and the Paris agreement can be consistent with the conduct of large emitters,\u201d she said.</p> <p>As well as states, a select few organisations have been given permission to give statements. These include Opec, the World Health Organization, the EU and the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p> <p>The ICJ is one of three international courts tasked with producing an advisory opinion on climate change, alongside the international tribunal for the law of the sea (Itlos) and the inter-American court of human rights.</p> <p>Itlos was the first to complete its advisory opinion, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/21/greenhouse-gases-are-pollutants-that-kill-marine-life-court-rules\">stating earlier this year</a> that greenhouse gases are pollutants and that states have a legal responsibility to control them that goes beyond the UNFCCC.</p> <p>The inter-American court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/22/inter-american-court-climate-hearing-hear-from-victims-barbados\">held hearings</a> in Barbados and Brazil this year and is expected to be the next to publish its opinion.</p> <p>The ICJ will take these two advisory opinions into account, as well as significant court judgments from around the world, including a European court of human rights ruling earlier this year that Switzerland had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/apr/13/swiss-climate-ruling-global-impact-european-court-human-rights\">breached the human rights</a> of its citizens by not doing enough to cut national greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>The ICJ says its advisory opinions are not binding.

During a hearing at the Peace Palace in The Hague, which began on Monday, Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu\u2019s special envoy for climate change and environment, said responsibility for the climate crisis lay squarely with \u201ca handful of readily identifiable states\u201d that had produced the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions but stood to lose the least from the impacts. The court heard how Pacific island states such as Vanuatu were bearing the brunt of rising sea levels and increasingly frequent and severe disasters. \u201cWe find ourselves on the frontlines of a crisis we did not create,\u201d Regenvanu said. The hearing is the culmination of years of campaigning by a group of Pacific island law students and diplomacy spearheaded by Vanuatu. In March last year the UN general assembly unanimously approved a resolution calling on the ICJ to provide an advisory opinion on what obligations states have to tackle climate change and what the legal consequences could be if they fail to do so. Over the next two weeks, the court will hear statements from 98 countries, including wealthy developed states with the greatest historical responsibility for the climate emergency, such as the UK and Russia, and states that have contributed very little to global greenhouse gas emissions but stand to bear the brunt of their impact, including Bangladesh and Sudan as well as Pacific island countries. The US and China, the world\u2019s biggest emitters, will make statements too, even though neither fully recognises the court\u2019s authority. Regenvanu told the court that states continued to emit vast amounts of greenhouse gases in spite of \u201cincreasingly dire warnings\u201d from scientists, noting that emissions had increased by more than 50% since 1990. The court will publish written statements submitted to it as part of the advisory opinion process, a number of which will include personal testimonies from people affected or severely threatened by climate change. Ilan Kiloe, the legal counsel for the Melanesian Spearhead Group, a regional subgroup that includes Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, said: \u201cThe harsh reality is that many of our peoples will not survive.\u201d Kiloe said the climate crisis threatened the right of states to self-determination and that the injustice of climate change was inseparable from colonialism, which these countries had been subjected to by \u201ca few readily identifiable states\u201d. He said: \u201cWe have not yet recovered from the ongoing violence \u2026 inflicted on us as we struggle to rebuild and assert ourselves within a system we did not create.\u201d Margaretha Wewerinke-Singh, the lead counsel for Vanuatu and the Melanesian Spearhead Group, said some states had breached international law through their acts and omissions. She said this included issuing licences for fossil fuel extraction and granting subsidies to the fossil fuel industry, as well as failure to regulate emissions or to provide finance under the UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC). Finance was the main sticking point at the recent Cop29 climate talks, which ended in what negotiators described as a \u201ctravesty of justice\u201d. Wewerinke-Singh said responsible states were required to make full reparation for the injury they had caused and this must be \u201cproportionate to historic contributions to the harm\u201d. She said this could include monetary compensation in addition to cash committed under the UNFCCC. During the first day of hearings, states tussled over whether their legal obligations extend beyond the UNFCCC. The UN describes the Paris agreement, which was passed in 2015, as a \u201clegally binding international treaty on climate change\u201d but states are free to set their own targets and policies in their nationally determined contributions. Germany and Saudi Arabia contended that they had no obligations beyond this treaty. Wiebke R\u00fcckert, the director for public international law for Germany, said the Paris agreement struck a \u201ccareful balance\u201d between legal and non-legal commitments and any attempts to limit it could seriously endanger the willingness of states to take part in political processes. But Zachary Phillips, counsel for Antigua and Barbuda, said compliance with the Paris agreement was \u201cnecessary but may not be sufficient\u201d to comply with customary international law including the obligation to prevent harm. Cynthia Houniuhi, the president of Pacific Island Students Fighting Climate Change, the youth group that sought the advisory opinion, said young people had looked to the Paris agreement as an instrument of hope when it was passed in 2015 but it had since been \u201chijacked\u201d by fossil fuel interests. \u201cNo good faith understanding of the UNFCCC and the Paris agreement can be consistent with the conduct of large emitters,\u201d she said. As well as states, a select few organisations have been given permission to give statements. These include Opec, the World Health Organization, the EU and the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The ICJ is one of three international courts tasked with producing an advisory opinion on climate change, alongside the international tribunal for the law of the sea (Itlos) and the inter-American court of human rights. Itlos was the first to complete its advisory opinion, stating earlier this year that greenhouse gases are pollutants and that states have a legal responsibility to control them that goes beyond the UNFCCC. The inter-American court held hearings in Barbados and Brazil this year and is expected to be the next to publish its opinion. The ICJ will take these two advisory opinions into account, as well as significant court judgments from around the world, including a European court of human rights ruling earlier this year that Switzerland had breached the human rights of its citizens by not doing enough to cut national greenhouse gas emissions. The ICJ says its advisory opinions are not binding. Experts stress that they clarify rather than create new law and will be referred to as authoritative documents in future climate litigation and during international climate negotiations.",

      "bodyText": "The historic tea brand Typhoo has been bought out of administration by the vapes and batteries maker Supreme in a \u00a310m rescue deal. The company filed to appoint administrators last Wednesday, risking the future of the 121-year-old brand. However, the London-listed Supreme, which last week confirmed it was in talks over a rescue deal, said on Monday it had completed a deal to buy the brand. Supreme said it would pay \u00a310.2m to buy Typhoo, in a deal that values the brand\u2019s stock and trade debts at \u00a37.5m. Typhoo has long been one of Britain\u2019s favourite tea brands after launching in Birmingham in 1903, becoming the first pre-packaged tea sold in the UK. The company was founded by John Sumner, who created the product to help with his sister\u2019s indigestion and named the brand after the Mandarin word for doctor. It generated revenues of more than \u00a325m for the year to 30 September, with a pre-tax loss of nearly\u00a338m, including \u00a324m in exceptional costs. The new owner said it planned to run Typhoo on a \u201ccapital-light, outsourced manufacturing model\u201d in an attempt to improve profits. The administration followed several years of declining sales, mounting debts and even a break-in last year at Typhoo\u2019s Wirral factory In August 2023, intruders broke in and occupied the Moreton plant for several days, causing \u201cextensive damage\u201d to the facility and making it inaccessible. As a result, Typhoo had to close the plant and switch production, racking up \u00a324m of costs, including nearly \u00a37m on property impairments. The company is also likely to have been been hit by a fall in tea consumption in Britain, with younger consumers turning to coffee, energy drinks and newer trends such as bubble tea. A consumer survey by Statista last year found that, for the first time, coffee had overtaken tea as the most popular hot drink with Britons, with 63% drinking coffee regularly and only 59% drinking tea. According to the market analysts Mintel, consumption of tea is expected to fall by 8% between 2023 and 2028. Insolvency specialists at Kroll were appointed to oversee the administration process and strike a sale deal. It is understood the business has fewer than 100 employees. The move is part of a strategy by Supreme to expand its operations away from vaping, after buying the soft drinks business Clearly Drinks earlier this year, before a planned government crackdown on disposable vapes. The Supreme chief executive, Sandy Chadha, said: \u201cThe acquisition of Typhoo Tea marks a significant step in our broader diversification strategy and brings one of the most iconic UK consumer brands into the Supreme family. \u201cI believe Typhoo Tea will thrive under our ownership, further benefiting from Supreme\u2019s significant market reach and successful track record in creating brand loyalty, making us an ideal fit for this business.\u201d",

Joe Biden has granted \u201ca full and unconditional\u201d pardon to his son Hunter Biden, days before he was due to be sentenced for convictions on federal gun and tax charges, the US president said in a statement released by the White House on Sunday. Biden had repeatedly said he would not use his executive power to pardon his son or commute his sentence \u2013 but reversed his position at the weekend, claiming that his son\u2019s prosecution was politically motivated. In his statement, Biden argued that \u201cit is clear that Hunter was treated differently\u201d, adding that the charges in the case \u201ccame about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election\u201d. How did Republicans respond? Donald Trump called the decision \u201csuch an abuse and miscarriage of justice\u201d.

How will Canada secure its border? LeBlanc said Canada would procure more drones and police helicopters and redeploy personnel. Iranian-backed militias reportedly enter Syria to back Assad\u2019s army Iranian-backed militias have reportedly entered Syria overnight and are moving on northern Syria to bolster Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces after Syrian and Russian airstrikes battered the region where insurgents have mounted their strongest challenge in years.

The attack began on Wednesday, and by Saturday they had forced out government forces. Why was Assad\u2019s army so vulnerable? In part because its backer, Russia, has shifted its focus and resources to Ukraine. In other news \u2026 Protesters rallied in Tbilisi for a fourth consecutive night on Sunday against the government\u2019s decision to pause talks on joining the European Union. A bear that attacked a supermarket worker in northern Japan has been killed after hiding in the store for three days.

      "body": "<p>I am a duvet-coatholic, I admit. I own three down coats, and I love them all. They have swaddled me during bad times and good. As a style journalist, I\u2019ve worn them to catwalk shows, where slim-fitting ultra light iterations, layered under peacoats, have seen me through snowstorms. I\u2019m also rather fond of a short, marshmallowy model, which I frequently pull on over long, form-fitting skirts for winter dinners. Its silhouette brings drama \u2013 and gives me somewhere to take an impromptu micronap \u2013 while its comforting, laid-back vibe ensures I never feel overdressed.</p> \n<p>Finally, there is my full-length duvet coat, a garment I practically melded with during that terrible, cold, dark Covid winter of socialising outside. It was only that duvet coat that could get me out of the house \u2013 a soothing, warming full body hug as well as an in-built social distancing tool. Unlike so many other survival mechanisms that winter (quarantini, anyone?), that duvet coat has not proved regrettable. It remains part of my life. Because there is no other coat that can insulate me \u2013 literally and emotionally \u2013 in quite the same way. The down jacket has become a modern fashion classic for a reason.</p> \n<p>The down coat has played an oversized role in fashion for at least 10 years, particularly since Balenciaga featured a red number on the catwalk in 2016. Its soft, soothing contours have been seen throughout culture, on the backs of Billie Eilish, Bella Hadid and the cast of Succession alike. It often brings drama, as with Carrie Bradshaw\u2019s huge puffer gown in And Just Like That or Rihanna\u2019s puffy coat on the Super Bowl LVII half-time show stage. It remains a catwalk staple, seen during the latest round of autumn/winter shows, including a belted, longline wine-coloured haute sleeping bag iteration at Jil Sander, military influenced puffers at Schiaparelli, and a red puffed-up twin set of jacket and midi skirt at Balenciaga.</p> \n<p>For a practical garment, the down jacket can be a bit of a show-off at times. Admittedly, sometimes, the fashion crowd styles puffers in amusingly impractical ways \u2013 slipping off shoulders, baring a lot of skin, in a way that might not be much use in a blizzard. Worn on the streets, however, during the day-to-day reality of getting through cold days under grey skies, the down coat is unmatched.</p> \n<p>I find Uniqlo\u2019s jackets to be the most durable on the high street, in part because they are designed with an eye on tech. I\u2019ve had my <a href=\"https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/products/E469869-000/00?colorDisplayCode=69&amp;sizeDisplayCode=003&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=BMK_UK_fw24_prospecting_Down_Down_for_Winter\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uniqlo ultra light down jacket</a> for about eight years, for instance, and it\u2019s still going strong. Aesthetically, it\u2019s the subtlest type of down layer there is: I bought mine in a small size, so it\u2019s tight enough to wear under suits and smart coats if I want a crisp silhouette when it\u2019s cold. I appreciated the option to ball it up small, in its carrying pouch, and put it in my bag once I\u2019ve warmed up inside.</p> \n<p>On the other end of the subtlety spectrum \u2013 bringing optimum warmth and coverage \u2013 is the full duvet coat. I\u2019d choose Uniqlo\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/products/E469898-000/00?colorDisplayCode=58&amp;sizeDisplayCode=003&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=BMK_UK_fw24_prospecting_Down_Down_for_Winter\" rel=\"nofollow\">Seamless down long coat in dark green</a> if I was shopping for one now \u2013 it\u2019s water-repellent, doesn\u2019t have toxic PFAS \u201cforever chemicals\u201d, and is a largely stitch-free design. It has fleece-lined pockets (a rarity in high street coats) and a down count of more than 750 fill power, with a ratio of 90% down to 10% feathers to maximise warmth. I\u2019d style it in ways that bring a bit of individuality and interest, including pairing it with contrasting colours. A light-coloured beanie and brown scarf, light coloured, patterned socks and thick-soled hiking boots, for example.</p> \n<p>The excellent thing about down coats, though, is that even if you are duvet coat allergic there are iterations in alternative silhouettes that bring much of the warmth. I\u2019d recommend seeking out coloured options \u2013 particularly if you usually wear a lot of black \u2013 for short styles, such as Uniqlo\u2019s Seamless down parka, which I like <a href=\"https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/products/E469896-000/00?colorDisplayCode=67&amp;sizeDisplayCode=003&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=BMK_UK_fw24_prospecting_Down_Down_for_Winter\" rel=\"nofollow\">in blue</a>, and its recycled down <a href=\"https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/products/E470150-000/00?colorDisplayCode=19&amp;sizeDisplayCode=004&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=BMK_UK_fw24_prospecting_Down_Down_for_Winter\" rel=\"nofollow\">jacket in wine</a>, a bomber shape, with a diamond quilted pattern, which is also unisex.</p> \n<p>I also love the <a href=\"https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/products/E469864-000/00?colorDisplayCode=57&amp;sizeDisplayCode=003&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=BMK_UK_fw24_prospecting_Down_Down_for_Winter\" rel=\"nofollow\">Puffertech relaxed jacket</a> for women, made from a down alternative \u2013 it uses Japanese double weave fibre technology to capture warmth. I\u2019d buy it in olive and layer it with a cream hoodie. Its cocoon shape works well with leggings or straight-legged jeans for relaxed days. For men, I love the <a href=\"https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/products/E472293-000/00?colorDisplayCode=09&amp;sizeDisplayCode=004?utm_source=The_Guardian&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=BMK_UK_fw24_prospecting_Down_Down_This_Winter\" rel=\"nofollow\">Puffertech quilted jacket in beige or green</a>, which looks excellent layered over sweaters and shirts. Or, if you want cosiness without a hint of undulating silhouette, the men\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/products/E473379-000/00?colorDisplayCode=57&amp;sizeDisplayCode=004&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=BMK_UK_fw24_prospecting_Down_Down_for_Winter\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hybrid down parka</a> is cosy, has ventilation mesh, and all the same tech properties with a sleeker shape.</p> \n<p>In my view, the squishy comfort of the down coat makes it a bit easier to leave the house at this time of year \u2013 it wraps me up and gets me out, reminds me to look up and appreciate the stars, even during the coldest, darkest winters.</p> \n<p><em>Shop Uniqlo\u2019s down coat collection at <a href=\"https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/?utm_source=guardian&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=BMK_UK_fw24_prospecting_Down_Down_for_Winter\" rel=\"nofollow\">uniqlo.com</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--immersive\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/labs/2024/11/shoppable/shop-3\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

I\u2019m also rather fond of a short, marshmallowy model, which I frequently pull on over long, form-fitting skirts for winter dinners. Its silhouette brings drama \u2013 and gives me somewhere to take an impromptu micronap \u2013 while its comforting, laid-back vibe ensures I never feel overdressed. Finally, there is my full-length duvet coat, a garment I practically melded with during that terrible, cold, dark Covid winter of socialising outside. It was only that duvet coat that could get me out of the house \u2013 a soothing, warming full body hug as well as an in-built social distancing tool. Unlike so many other survival mechanisms that winter (quarantini, anyone?), that duvet coat has not proved regrettable. It remains part of my life. Because there is no other coat that can insulate me \u2013 literally and emotionally \u2013 in quite the same way. The down jacket has become a modern fashion classic for a reason. The down coat has played an oversized role in fashion for at least 10 years, particularly since Balenciaga featured a red number on the catwalk in 2016. Its soft, soothing contours have been seen throughout culture, on the backs of Billie Eilish, Bella Hadid and the cast of Succession alike. It often brings drama, as with Carrie Bradshaw\u2019s huge puffer gown in And Just Like That or Rihanna\u2019s puffy coat on the Super Bowl LVII half-time show stage. It remains a catwalk staple, seen during the latest round of autumn/winter shows, including a belted, longline wine-coloured haute sleeping bag iteration at Jil Sander, military influenced puffers at Schiaparelli, and a red puffed-up twin set of jacket and midi skirt at Balenciaga. For a practical garment, the down jacket can be a bit of a show-off at times. Admittedly, sometimes, the fashion crowd styles puffers in amusingly impractical ways \u2013 slipping off shoulders, baring a lot of skin, in a way that might not be much use in a blizzard. Worn on the streets, however, during the day-to-day reality of getting through cold days under grey skies, the down coat is unmatched. I find Uniqlo\u2019s jackets to be the most durable on the high street, in part because they are designed with an eye on tech. I\u2019ve had my Uniqlo ultra light down jacket for about eight years, for instance, and it\u2019s still going strong. Aesthetically, it\u2019s the subtlest type of down layer there is: I bought mine in a small size, so it\u2019s tight enough to wear under suits and smart coats if I want a crisp silhouette when it\u2019s cold. I appreciated the option to ball it up small, in its carrying pouch, and put it in my bag once I\u2019ve warmed up inside. On the other end of the subtlety spectrum \u2013 bringing optimum warmth and coverage \u2013 is the full duvet coat. I\u2019d choose Uniqlo\u2019s Seamless down long coat in dark green if I was shopping for one now \u2013 it\u2019s water-repellent, doesn\u2019t have toxic PFAS \u201cforever chemicals\u201d, and is a largely stitch-free design. It has fleece-lined pockets (a rarity in high street coats) and a down count of more than 750 fill power, with a ratio of 90% down to 10% feathers to maximise warmth. I\u2019d style it in ways that bring a bit of individuality and interest, including pairing it with contrasting colours. A light-coloured beanie and brown scarf, light coloured, patterned socks and thick-soled hiking boots, for example. The excellent thing about down coats, though, is that even if you are duvet coat allergic there are iterations in alternative silhouettes that bring much of the warmth. I\u2019d recommend seeking out coloured options \u2013 particularly if you usually wear a lot of black \u2013 for short styles, such as Uniqlo\u2019s Seamless down parka, which I like in blue, and its recycled down jacket in wine, a bomber shape, with a diamond quilted pattern, which is also unisex. I also love the Puffertech relaxed jacket for women, made from a down alternative \u2013 it uses Japanese double weave fibre technology to capture warmth. I\u2019d buy it in olive and layer it with a cream hoodie. Its cocoon shape works well with leggings or straight-legged jeans for relaxed days. For men, I love the Puffertech quilted jacket in beige or green, which looks excellent layered over sweaters and shirts. Or, if you want cosiness without a hint of undulating silhouette, the men\u2019s Hybrid down parka is cosy, has ventilation mesh, and all the same tech properties with a sleeker shape. In my view, the squishy comfort of the down coat makes it a bit easier to leave the house at this time of year \u2013 it wraps me up and gets me out, reminds me to look up and appreciate the stars, even during the coldest, darkest winters.

      "bodyText": "Binding global targets to cut plastic production must be at the centre of any continuing negotiations to secure the world\u2019s first treaty to tackle plastic waste, a group of 85 countries has said. Talks in Busan, South Korea, attempting to secure agreement between more than 200 countries on the details of a plastic pollution treaty ended in failure over the weekend. Graham Forbes, the lead delegate for Greenpeace at the talks, said on Monday: \u201cWe stand at a historic crossroads. The opportunity to secure an impactful plastics treaty that protects our health, biodiversity and climate remains within reach.\u201d The week-long talks, known as INC-5, which were supposed to be the last before the first treaty to cut plastic pollution was signed, ended without agreement in the early hours of Monday in a deadlock over the inclusion of cuts to plastic production between so-called ambition countries and fossil fuel states, which object to any reductions in production. More than 100 countries supported a draft text that included legally binding global reductions in plastic production and phasing out certain chemicals and single-use plastic products. But the resistance of countries including Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia to production reductions, according to statements in their submissions to the treaty talks, led negotiators to concede defeat. They acknowledged they had failed to bridge serious divisions over the aims of the treaty. Abdulrahman al-Gwaiz, the Saudi Arabian delegate, indicated that production cuts remained a red line for many countries. \u201cIf you address plastic pollution, there should be no problem with producing plastics, because the problem is the pollution, not the plastics themselves,\u201d he said. In response to the failure of the talks, countries pushing for production cuts continued to call for legally binding reductions. Eighty-five countries and political blocs including the UK, the EU, Spain, Germany, Mexico and Greece signed a declaration committing to stand up for ambition in the treaty. Juliet Kabera, the director general of Rwanda\u2019s environment management authority, said in a statement on behalf of the high-ambition countries: \u201cWe voice our strong concerns about ongoing calls by a small group of countries to remove binding provisions from the text that are indispensable for the treaty to be effective.\u201d The ambition countries said the treaty must contain binding provisions for a global target to reduce the production of primary plastic polymers to sustainable levels. The US, which had spoken of support for voluntary reductions in production, was accused of failing to use its influence to push for legally binding measures. Rachel Radvany, a campaigner for the environmental law group CIEL, said: \u201cDespite maintaining in the lead-up to and during the INC that production and chemicals were important measures for the treaty, they refused to \u2026 answer the call to join more than 100 countries calling for legally binding measures.\u201d Hugo Schally, the director general for the environment at the European Commission, said: \u201cThe EU is disappointed by the outcome of INC-5; we didn\u2019t get what we came here for, a binding treaty with decisive action against plastic pollution \u2026 but we feel encouraged and empowered by a growing number of countries sharing the same ambitions.\u201d Another meeting is planned but the UN environment chief, Inger Andersen, acknowledged that deep differences remained and \u201csome significant conversations\u201d were needed first. \u201cI do believe that there\u2019s no point in meeting unless we can see a pathway from Busan to the treaty text being gavelled,\u201d she said.

The ruling clears the uncertainty that has hung over the country since the court demanded a vote recount last week, after the victory of a little-known far-right candidate raised suspicions of outside meddling in the electoral process of a country that has been a staunch ally of Ukraine. C\u01celin Georgescu, a Moscow-friendly ultranationalist, will now face the centre-right contender Elena Lasconi in a runoff on Sunday. The much-anticipated court decision was announced a day after Romania held a parliamentary election in which the ruling Social Democrat party (PSD) appeared on course to win the most votes. Who will eventually form the government will depend on who wins the presidential race, since the president designates a prime minister from a parliamentary majority. On Monday officials said that with 99.5% of votes counted in the parliamentary election, the centre-left PSD had 22.6% of the vote, with the far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) in second place, with 18.2%. The National Liberal party (PNL), the Social Democrats\u2019 coalition ally in Romania\u2019s outgoing government, was in third on 14.4%. With the centre-right Save Romania Union (USR) on 12.1%, the near-final result means about seven out of 10 Romanians voted for mainstream parties, defying predictions the country would veer hard right after the first round of the presidential election on 24 November.

The presidential office has said government officials detected online efforts to influence voting in the presidential ballot, including \u201cmassive exposure due to preferential treatment\u201d on TikTok.

I immediately decided it was about a Christmas tree, and, although I liked difficult poems with words long and strange enough to get lost in, I was delighted by the sudden appearance of the familiar.

When December\u2019s dreariness deepens, after a brief temperature rise, the re-frozen ice-melt fails to \u201cglue\u201d the branches and prevent their budding. In the next stanza, there\u2019s more ice, and, again, an untroubled response, this time from the brook.

It suggests disappointment and the resulting \u201cpetulance\u201d or \u201cgetting in a pet\u201d \u2013 a childish response the brook entirely resists in enduring the absence of the love-gaze in this newly \u201cfrozen time\u201d.</p> <p>Having fixed the almost druggy contentment of the brook, the poem easily moves on to the contrast in human affairs.

In drear nighted December, Too happy, happy brook, Thy bubblings ne\u2019er remember Apollo\u2019s summer look; But with a sweet forgetting, They stay their crystal fretting, Never, never petting About the frozen time. Ah! would \u2019twere with so many A gentle girl and boy \u2014 But were there ever any Writh\u2019d not of passing joy? The feel of not to feel it, Where there is none to heal it Nor numbed sense to steel it, Was never said in rhyme. Written in early December 1817, John Keats\u2019s In Drear Nighted December was one of the first poems I read as a child. I immediately decided it was about a Christmas tree, and, although I liked difficult poems with words long and strange enough to get lost in, I was delighted by the sudden appearance of the familiar. And here was an insight, in the second line, which had occurred to me as well: the tree was \u201ctoo happy\u201d in its domestic splendour.

I was further disoriented by the sudden appearance of a brook, and, oh dear, a girl and boy in boring love. More patient today, I\u2019ve worked out what a fine little poem-song this is, and how freshly it says what it says. The title-lines, first: the lack of a hyphen between \u201cdrear\u201d and \u201cnighted\u201d adds to the slow weight of the words opening stanzas one and two.

The energy of the rhyme-scheme springs from folk song and folk-speech foundations. Description is marvellously compressed in the \u201csleety whistle\u201d of the wind in the trees branches, and the \u201cfrozen thawings\u201d which almost contain a season-change.

Set up in prototype on Miami Beach itself, it will be a part of Star Compass, a series of three large-scale installations curated by Ximena Caminos and Dodie Kazanjian. In addition to Reef Star, Star Compass will also include The Great Elephant Migration, a work consisting of 100 life-sized sculptures of elephants, and Voile/Toile \u2013 Toile/Voile by French conceptual artist Daniel Buren, which will stage an enormous sailboat race.</p> <p>Miami Reef Star will be composed of dozens of smaller stars, each itself serving multiple functions as hybrid coral reef, a home for fish and microorganisms, and an eye-catching site-specific sculpture. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive amount of engineering that went into this,\u201d said artist Carlos Betancourt, the creator of Miami Reef Star. \u201cWe\u2019re working with marine biologists, scientists from the University of Miami \u2026 we\u2019ve learned intensely about this.\u201d</p> <p>Reef Star plays on the form of starfish, with individual stars offering whimsical shapes that feel soft, playful and organic. When placed together they form a large star shape, which Caminos, founder and artistic director of The ReefLine, sees as an essential metaphor. \u201cBefore all this technology transformed our lives, humans used to sail the seas looking at stars and being guided by stars,\u201d Caminos said. \u201cTo me the stars are like a metaphor that we need a new north.\u201d</p>    <p>The modules in Miami Reef Star were created via 3D printing, utilizing two technologies that are meant to make it environmentally advantageous: CarbonXinc and Coral Lok. Created specifically for use in The ReefLine, CarbonXinc is a combination of eco-friendly concrete and materials that will pull carbon out of the atmosphere, capturing it in Reef Star as a carbon sink. Coral Lok is a device that makes it easier to regenerate coral reefs, in which individual loks are screwed into receiver materials, offering a foothold for new coral growth.</p> <p>According to Caminos, the Great Florida Reef is the third-largest in the world. The only living coral barrier reef in the continental US, since the 1980s it has been in sharp decline. Threats to the reef include the spread of disease, bleaching due to elevated water temperatures, and sea-level rise, which can change the composition of ocean water in ways dangerous to coral and other organisms that thrive in the reefs.</p> <p>Betancourt shared that in creating Reef Star, he in part drew inspiration from the artist Christo\u2019s giant sculpture Surrounded Islands, in which the Bulgarian artist and his collaborator Jeanne-Claude Denat de Guillebon encircled 11 islands Miami\u2019s Biscayne Bay with floating pink fabric. \u201cBefore that, I didn\u2019t know you could do art by surrounding islands, by putting pink plastic around them,\u201d said Betancourt. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to expand your horizons when you see something like that. That project helped identify Miami as an adventurous place for art, and to this day I still use Christo Pink, it permeates all through my work. I\u2019ll never never never forget it.\u201d</p> <p>Betancourt and his collaborator, architect Alberto Latorre, are both originally from Puerto Rico, and the reefs and waters off the coast of Miami and around the Caribbean Islands have long been central parts of their creative imaginations. For them, getting to place art into the seabed just off of Miami Beach was deeply connected to their artistic and cultural communities. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the bleaching, we\u2019ve seen what pollution does to the reefs,\u201d said Latorre. \u201cWhat better thing to do than to collaborate with an amazing team to use this synthesis of art and science as a vehicle to create these artificial reefs?\u201d</p>    <p>Funded in part by a $5m bond approved by Miami voters in 2022, The ReefLine will be implemented over the course of several years, according to a series of planned phases. Phase I is slated to occur in spring 2025, when Concrete Coral, a sculpture by Argentine artist Leandro Erlich, will be made by sinking 22 concrete cars to form an art work modeled on a traffic jam. Seeded with innumerable Coral Loks that will foster the development of coral reefs, the work will ironically help to reverse the impact of automobiles on the reefs and oceans.</p> <p>Reef Star is scheduled to be part of phase II, which will by implemented over the next two years. Future phases include British artist Petroc Sesti\u2019s Heart of Okeanos, which is modeled after the heart of a blue whale, and a series of modules designed by Japanese architect Shohei Shigematsu that will eventually come to form a \u201cliving breakwater\u201d.</p> <p>Caminos sees these developments as very much a part of Miami\u2019s larger-scale aspirations to be a leader in reversing climate change. \u201cMiami is ground zero for climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the city saw in ReefLine the image that they wanted to forecast to the world. That they\u2019re not just a city with a problem but also a city that can bring forward a solution. Miami is slowly becoming a climate tech hub.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, Caminos hopes that The ReefLine will become a landmark synonymous with Miami as much as the Empire State Building is associated with New York City or Big Ben is associated with London. She also hopes that it will be a leading site of advocacy for the oceans, and a way of bringing about environmental change. \u201cArt has the power to tap into someone\u2019s emotions, and I hope that The ReefLine will inspire,\u201d said Caminos. \u201cIt has the power to inspire people to act \u2013 the oceans are our heritage, and they are dying in silence because they don\u2019t have a voice. They need someone to stand up for them. The world is at a very complex moment, and messages of hope are needed.\u201d</p>",

In addition to Reef Star, Star Compass will also include The Great Elephant Migration, a work consisting of 100 life-sized sculptures of elephants, and Voile/Toile \u2013 Toile/Voile by French conceptual artist Daniel Buren, which will stage an enormous sailboat race. Miami Reef Star will be composed of dozens of smaller stars, each itself serving multiple functions as hybrid coral reef, a home for fish and microorganisms, and an eye-catching site-specific sculpture. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive amount of engineering that went into this,\u201d said artist Carlos Betancourt, the creator of Miami Reef Star. \u201cWe\u2019re working with marine biologists, scientists from the University of Miami \u2026 we\u2019ve learned intensely about this.\u201d Reef Star plays on the form of starfish, with individual stars offering whimsical shapes that feel soft, playful and organic. When placed together they form a large star shape, which Caminos, founder and artistic director of The ReefLine, sees as an essential metaphor. \u201cBefore all this technology transformed our lives, humans used to sail the seas looking at stars and being guided by stars,\u201d Caminos said. \u201cTo me the stars are like a metaphor that we need a new north.\u201d The modules in Miami Reef Star were created via 3D printing, utilizing two technologies that are meant to make it environmentally advantageous: CarbonXinc and Coral Lok. Created specifically for use in The ReefLine, CarbonXinc is a combination of eco-friendly concrete and materials that will pull carbon out of the atmosphere, capturing it in Reef Star as a carbon sink. Coral Lok is a device that makes it easier to regenerate coral reefs, in which individual loks are screwed into receiver materials, offering a foothold for new coral growth. According to Caminos, the Great Florida Reef is the third-largest in the world. The only living coral barrier reef in the continental US, since the 1980s it has been in sharp decline. Threats to the reef include the spread of disease, bleaching due to elevated water temperatures, and sea-level rise, which can change the composition of ocean water in ways dangerous to coral and other organisms that thrive in the reefs. Betancourt shared that in creating Reef Star, he in part drew inspiration from the artist Christo\u2019s giant sculpture Surrounded Islands, in which the Bulgarian artist and his collaborator Jeanne-Claude Denat de Guillebon encircled 11 islands Miami\u2019s Biscayne Bay with floating pink fabric. \u201cBefore that, I didn\u2019t know you could do art by surrounding islands, by putting pink plastic around them,\u201d said Betancourt. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to expand your horizons when you see something like that. That project helped identify Miami as an adventurous place for art, and to this day I still use Christo Pink, it permeates all through my work. I\u2019ll never never never forget it.\u201d Betancourt and his collaborator, architect Alberto Latorre, are both originally from Puerto Rico, and the reefs and waters off the coast of Miami and around the Caribbean Islands have long been central parts of their creative imaginations. For them, getting to place art into the seabed just off of Miami Beach was deeply connected to their artistic and cultural communities. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the bleaching, we\u2019ve seen what pollution does to the reefs,\u201d said Latorre. \u201cWhat better thing to do than to collaborate with an amazing team to use this synthesis of art and science as a vehicle to create these artificial reefs?\u201d Funded in part by a $5m bond approved by Miami voters in 2022, The ReefLine will be implemented over the course of several years, according to a series of planned phases. Phase I is slated to occur in spring 2025, when Concrete Coral, a sculpture by Argentine artist Leandro Erlich, will be made by sinking 22 concrete cars to form an art work modeled on a traffic jam. Seeded with innumerable Coral Loks that will foster the development of coral reefs, the work will ironically help to reverse the impact of automobiles on the reefs and oceans. Reef Star is scheduled to be part of phase II, which will by implemented over the next two years. Future phases include British artist Petroc Sesti\u2019s Heart of Okeanos, which is modeled after the heart of a blue whale, and a series of modules designed by Japanese architect Shohei Shigematsu that will eventually come to form a \u201cliving breakwater\u201d. Caminos sees these developments as very much a part of Miami\u2019s larger-scale aspirations to be a leader in reversing climate change. \u201cMiami is ground zero for climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the city saw in ReefLine the image that they wanted to forecast to the world. That they\u2019re not just a city with a problem but also a city that can bring forward a solution. Miami is slowly becoming a climate tech hub.\u201d Ultimately, Caminos hopes that The ReefLine will become a landmark synonymous with Miami as much as the Empire State Building is associated with New York City or Big Ben is associated with London. She also hopes that it will be a leading site of advocacy for the oceans, and a way of bringing about environmental change. \u201cArt has the power to tap into someone\u2019s emotions, and I hope that The ReefLine will inspire,\u201d said Caminos. \u201cIt has the power to inspire people to act \u2013 the oceans are our heritage, and they are dying in silence because they don\u2019t have a voice. They need someone to stand up for them. The world is at a very complex moment, and messages of hope are needed.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>This graphic novel, published first in German, is based on a true story, and if you don\u2019t already know that tale (I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t), it will astonish you. A successful actor and her movie director ex-husband are kidnapped by an enemy state, so that they might make movies to please a dictator. On paper, this is the stuff of a disaster-ridden major motion picture, dreamed up by some crazed auteur. But it really happened. In 1978, Choi Eun-Hee, a celebrated actor in her native South Korea, was kidnapped by North Korean agents in Hong Kong, and transported to the city of Namp\u2019o, where she was met by Kim Jong-il, the son of the Great Leader, Kim Il-sung, and then head of the country\u2019s propaganda unit and film studios.</p> <p>When Choi\u2019s ex-husband, the director Shin Sang-ok, travelled to Hong Kong to try to find her, the same thing happened to him \u2013 though having twice tried to escape, he was eventually sent to a prison camp to be tortured and kept in solitary confinement (Choi\u2019s surroundings were luxurious, even if she was unable to leave them). In 1983, Kim initiated, with no advance warning, a meeting between Choi and Shin at a dinner in Pyongyang. Reunited, the two of them rekindled their relationship and Kim, the film fanatic, now explained the reason for their kidnapping: they were to shoot big-budget masterpieces for him, movies good enough to be shown at film festivals around the world. In the years that followed, they duly made several films, including <em>Pulgasari</em>, a North Korean version of <em>Godzilla</em>. In 1986, however, while they were at a festival in Vienna, they gave their guards the slip, and made it to the American embassy where they requested asylum.</p>    <p>In <em>Madame Choi and the Monsters</em>, Patrick Sp\u00e4t (words) and Sheree Domingo (pictures) tell the story of Choi and Shin, and a version of the Korean folk tale on which <em>Pulgasari </em>is based (a mixture of bear, elephant, rhino, tiger and bull, the Pulgasari is a devastatingly powerful creature that grows in size the more metal it eats). Both narratives are compelling; Domingo\u2019s drawings, highly energetic and extremely economical, make them move at pace in spite of their complicated nature. But I found myself so captivated by Choi and Shin that, in truth, I would have been happy to read only about them.

      "bodyText": "This graphic novel, published first in German, is based on a true story, and if you don\u2019t already know that tale (I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t), it will astonish you. A successful actor and her movie director ex-husband are kidnapped by an enemy state, so that they might make movies to please a dictator. On paper, this is the stuff of a disaster-ridden major motion picture, dreamed up by some crazed auteur. But it really happened. In 1978, Choi Eun-Hee, a celebrated actor in her native South Korea, was kidnapped by North Korean agents in Hong Kong, and transported to the city of Namp\u2019o, where she was met by Kim Jong-il, the son of the Great Leader, Kim Il-sung, and then head of the country\u2019s propaganda unit and film studios. When Choi\u2019s ex-husband, the director Shin Sang-ok, travelled to Hong Kong to try to find her, the same thing happened to him \u2013 though having twice tried to escape, he was eventually sent to a prison camp to be tortured and kept in solitary confinement (Choi\u2019s surroundings were luxurious, even if she was unable to leave them). In 1983, Kim initiated, with no advance warning, a meeting between Choi and Shin at a dinner in Pyongyang. Reunited, the two of them rekindled their relationship and Kim, the film fanatic, now explained the reason for their kidnapping: they were to shoot big-budget masterpieces for him, movies good enough to be shown at film festivals around the world. In the years that followed, they duly made several films, including Pulgasari, a North Korean version of Godzilla. In 1986, however, while they were at a festival in Vienna, they gave their guards the slip, and made it to the American embassy where they requested asylum. In Madame Choi and the Monsters, Patrick Sp\u00e4t (words) and Sheree Domingo (pictures) tell the story of Choi and Shin, and a version of the Korean folk tale on which Pulgasari is based (a mixture of bear, elephant, rhino, tiger and bull, the Pulgasari is a devastatingly powerful creature that grows in size the more metal it eats). Both narratives are compelling; Domingo\u2019s drawings, highly energetic and extremely economical, make them move at pace in spite of their complicated nature. But I found myself so captivated by Choi and Shin that, in truth, I would have been happy to read only about them. In particular, I would have liked to know more about what happened to them after their defection (though the authors do include a useful timeline at the back of their book). A bit of research courtesy of the internet reveals that, before the couple\u2019s return to South Korea in 1999, many of its citizens believed they went north voluntarily (North Korea has always denied they were kidnapped).

      "bodyText": "Senator Lidia Thorpe has apologised to Pauline Hanson for describing her as a \u201cconvicted\u201d racist, clarifying she was mistaken about a civil finding of racial discrimination. Last week Hanson threatened to sue Thorpe for defamation after Thorpe described the One Nation leader as a \u201cconvicted racist\u201d in an interview with Channel Nine\u2019s Today. \u201cSenator Hanson is a \u2018convicted\u2019 racist, she has worn a burqa in the chamber, she baits me regularly with racial taunts,\u201d Thorpe had said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Thorpe was referring to a federal court finding that Hanson had breached the Racial Discrimination Act by telling the Greens deputy leader, Mehreen Faruqi, to \u201cpack your bags and piss off back to Pakistan\u201d. Justice Angus Stewart found that Hanson\u2019s comment to Faruqi was a \u201cvariant of the slogan \u2018go back to from where you came from\u2019\u201d, which he said was a \u201cracist trope\u201d and a \u201cstrong form of racism\u201d. Hanson is appealing against the federal court finding. On Monday, Thorpe posted to X: \u201cTo clarify, I was mistaken that she was \u2018convicted\u2019 because it was a civil case.\u201d In a reply to the post she then added: \u201cSorry about that Pauline!\u201d Nine also reportedly issued a statement that it \u201cwishes to clarify that Senator Hanson has not been criminally convicted of racism, and any suggestion to the contrary is unequivocally withdrawn\u201d. Thorpe was suspended from the Senate on Wednesday for making \u201cinappropriate and sometimes abusive comments\u201d, after she appeared to throw paper at Pauline Hanson during a tense parliamentary debate. Thorpe angrily interjected during a debate sparked by Hanson unsuccessfully attempting to have the former Labor senator Fatima Payman investigated for an alleged section 44 citizenship issue. Hanson had alleged Payman had not provided enough documents to prove she had revoked her Afghan citizenship and was therefore ineligible to sit in parliament.",

      "body": "<p>In a lot of universes, Russell Wilson\u2019s story is over. Sean Payton and the Broncos were down enough on him at the end of last season, that they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/04/broncos-take-85m-hit-to-bring-russell-wilsons-denver-career-to-an-early-end\">paid the quarterback $85m to go away</a>.</p> <p>On Sunday, Wilson led the Steelers to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671627\">a 44-38 win over the Bengals</a>, roasting Cincinnati\u2019s porous defense for 414 yards, the second-most passing yards in a game of his career. He finished with three touchdowns and one interception, that sole turnover coming after a <a href=\"https://x.com/OllieConnolly/status/1863286235122290821\">botched call</a>.</p> <p>After being left on the scrapheap this offseason, Wilson has led the Steelers to a 5-1 record as a starter, putting them in first place in a competitive AFC North. It feels fitting that with Wilson\u2019s best performance in years, he also secured Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin\u2019s 18th successive season with a non-losing record.</p> <p>Tomlin was the lone believer when the rest of the league bailed on the quarterback. Wilson probably heard the talk. Whereas his athleticism had been enough to overcome deficiencies earlier in his career, that had now faded. In Denver, he had become an immobile, inaccurate passer. In short: he was no longer a quarterback you could win with.</p> <p>With Denver paying the bulk of his salary this season, Wilson was available, essentially, for free. Teams only needed to commit to the league\u2019s minimum salary to bring in the 36-year-old. But Wilson was a distant second option behind Kirk Cousins in free agency, and most quarterback-needy teams instead turned to the draft.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/27/can-daniel-jones-be-saved-with-the-right-team-and-offense\">Can Daniel Jones be saved with the right team and offense?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even Tomlin hedged his bets, sanctioning a trade for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/16/justin-fields-trade-pittsburgh-steelers-chicago-bears\">Justin Fields from the Bears</a> after signing Wilson to a one-year contract in free agency. Shortly before the opening week of the season, Wilson sustained a calf injury that kept him out for six weeks.

They are winning with an old-school formula. They run the ball. Their offensive line is physical. They hit a few chunk plays a game, relying on George Pickens to manufacture shots in the passing game. Their pass-rush is relentless, with unsung gems like Nick Herbig and Larry Ogunjobi often outplaying the superstars. Together, they have formed the best four-man pass-rush in the NFL, helping to cover up a faulty secondary.</p> <p>Tomlin has produced one of the best coaching jobs of his career. But he surely recognizes his team will only go as deep in the playoffs as Wilson can take them. It was only two years ago that Wilson had fallen from a potential future Hall of Famer to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/07/russell-wilson-made-history-in-denver-it-was-just-the-wrong-kind\">laughing stock</a>. But in Pittsburgh, he\u2019s been slotted into his old Seattle role: relying on the run game, keeping the offense on schedule, limiting turnovers, creating a few off-script plays a game and letting the defensive playmakers prove to be the difference.</p> <p>Wilson fought against that profile for a while. Whereas the coaching staff in Seattle looked at Wilson as a cog in a championship machine, Wilson looked in the mirror and saw Peyton Manning. He ditched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/mar/11/russell-wilson-trade-seattle-seahawks-chicago-bears\">Seattle for Denver, hoping for more of everything</a><em>. </em>More yards, touchdowns, control of the offense, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/mar/11/russell-wilson-trade-seattle-seahawks-chicago-bears\">accolades and respect</a>.</p> <p>But it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/dec/30/russell-wilson-denver-broncos-benched-contract\">was a farce</a>, with the franchise effectively running the quarterback out of Denver. With his career in freefall, Tomlin tossed Wilson a career lifeline. Still: Even the coach must be a touch surprised by the results.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just what Wilson is doing; it\u2019s how. He is punishing defensive mistakes. He is hitting downfield throws, outside the numbers, at a sky-high clip. What separated Wilson from the pack in Seattle was that he hit atypical throws at a league-leading rate. You know the throw: a deep, arcing moonshot along the sideline. With the Broncos, Wilson\u2019s deep ball vanished. With the Steelers, he\u2019s back to his best. He leads all qualified quarterbacks in <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/news/next-gen-stats-intro-to-passing-score-metric\">Completion Percentage Over Expectation</a> on attempts of 10 air yards or more this season (+15.7%).</p> <p>Wilson has shown a stronger feel for what a game requires, too. His freelancing is less frequent these days, but it\u2019s always there, simmering away in the background if required. Against the Bengals, what was required was ripping apart zone coverages. Cincinnati sagged off Pittsburgh\u2019s receiving corps, hoping to force Wilson to hold the ball long enough that the pass-rush could come screaming home.</p> <p>Wilson in Denver would have acquiesced. He would have gone big play hunting, betting that he could outrun the pass-rush before uncorking throws down the field. He would have wanted to <em>prove </em>he was a blue-chip creator, closer to Patrick Mahomes than Brock Purdy. The offense would have bogged down as Wilson bounced around trying to create. But Wilson in Pittsburgh is comfortable taking what the defense offers, sticking to the system and churning out scoring drives. On Sunday, he sped up his delivery, getting the ball out early to allow his receivers to create after the catch. In the first half, Wilson\u2019s average depth of target was three yards, with 67% of his 257 yards coming after the catch. When the Bengals adjusted their approach in the second half, Wilson pivoted, attacking deeper down the field.</p> <p>There are still things to nitpick about Wilson\u2019s game, flaws that could be exposed in a close postseason matchup. But he has <a href=\"https://x.com/TheoAshNFL/status/1863332594848264452\">offset some of his traditional shortcomings </a>\u2013 and has proven deft enough to manage close games. He is, once again, a winning quarterback.</p> <p>Wilson moved to Denver seeking respect. In Pittsburgh, he has found vindication.</p> <h2><strong>MVP of the week</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Jayden Daniels, quarterback, Washington Commanders.</strong> So much for Kliff Kingsbury\u2019s offense being <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5951612/2024/11/27/kliff-kingsbury-commanders-offense-struggles/\">found out in the second half of the season</a>. The Commanders <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671743\">raced past the Titans 42-19</a>, jumping out to a 21-0 lead before Tennessee had even run 10 <em>plays. </em>By the time Washington had a four-score lead, the Titans only had 24 yards of offense.</p> <p>It was an important rebound game for Daniels. After the first tricky stretch of his career, Daniels put together the most mature performance of his rookie season. He diced up the Titans\u2019 defense from the pocket, putting together a faultless first half in which he completed 14 of his 15 pass attempts for 105 yards, throwing two touchdowns with no interceptions while ripping off a succession of tight-window throws.</p> <p>More importantly, Daniels showed he is refining his craft as a runner. He is learning to pick his spots, understanding when to slide, and when to embrace contact. Washington\u2019s offense has faltered this season when Daniels has either been injured or limited as a rushing threat. When healthy, upright and able to scamper away from the opposing pass rush, Daniels has torched opposing defenses.</p> <h2><strong>Video of the week</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s always a blast when linemen get involved in the scoring.

Cousins\u2019 arm strength has eroded to the point where he can no longer fizz in throws against tight coverage. When the offensive design springs a receiver free, Cousins is slick enough to get the ball out on time. But in physical contests, when Cousins needs to throw his receivers open, he is unable to thread the needle. In his last three games, Cousins has failed to throw a touchdown and has turned the ball over 10 times. The Falcons are on a three-game losing streak and have a negative point differential.

      "bodyText": "In a lot of universes, Russell Wilson\u2019s story is over. Sean Payton and the Broncos were down enough on him at the end of last season, that they paid the quarterback $85m to go away. On Sunday, Wilson led the Steelers to a 44-38 win over the Bengals, roasting Cincinnati\u2019s porous defense for 414 yards, the second-most passing yards in a game of his career. He finished with three touchdowns and one interception, that sole turnover coming after a botched call. After being left on the scrapheap this offseason, Wilson has led the Steelers to a 5-1 record as a starter, putting them in first place in a competitive AFC North. It feels fitting that with Wilson\u2019s best performance in years, he also secured Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin\u2019s 18th successive season with a non-losing record. Tomlin was the lone believer when the rest of the league bailed on the quarterback. Wilson probably heard the talk. Whereas his athleticism had been enough to overcome deficiencies earlier in his career, that had now faded. In Denver, he had become an immobile, inaccurate passer. In short: he was no longer a quarterback you could win with. With Denver paying the bulk of his salary this season, Wilson was available, essentially, for free. Teams only needed to commit to the league\u2019s minimum salary to bring in the 36-year-old. But Wilson was a distant second option behind Kirk Cousins in free agency, and most quarterback-needy teams instead turned to the draft. Even Tomlin hedged his bets, sanctioning a trade for Justin Fields from the Bears after signing Wilson to a one-year contract in free agency. Shortly before the opening week of the season, Wilson sustained a calf injury that kept him out for six weeks. Fields led the Steelers to a winning record, showing just enough that Tomlin could have justified continuing to roll with the younger of his two offseason reclamation projects. But with no one watching, Wilson fought for his career, showing enough in practice that Tomlin felt comfortable pulling Fields out of a winning lineup. The early returns were scattershot, but Wilson now looks back to his vintage best. When he walked off the field in Cincinnati on Sunday, Tomlin was waiting outside the locker room to greet him. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, old man?\u201d Tomlin said as he embraced his quarterback. For the first time since Ben Roethlisberger retired, the Steelers have a legitimate shot at competing for a Super Bowl. They are winning with an old-school formula. They run the ball. Their offensive line is physical. They hit a few chunk plays a game, relying on George Pickens to manufacture shots in the passing game. Their pass-rush is relentless, with unsung gems like Nick Herbig and Larry Ogunjobi often outplaying the superstars. Together, they have formed the best four-man pass-rush in the NFL, helping to cover up a faulty secondary. Tomlin has produced one of the best coaching jobs of his career. But he surely recognizes his team will only go as deep in the playoffs as Wilson can take them. It was only two years ago that Wilson had fallen from a potential future Hall of Famer to a laughing stock. But in Pittsburgh, he\u2019s been slotted into his old Seattle role: relying on the run game, keeping the offense on schedule, limiting turnovers, creating a few off-script plays a game and letting the defensive playmakers prove to be the difference. Wilson fought against that profile for a while. Whereas the coaching staff in Seattle looked at Wilson as a cog in a championship machine, Wilson looked in the mirror and saw Peyton Manning. He ditched Seattle for Denver, hoping for more of everything. More yards, touchdowns, control of the offense, accolades and respect. But it was a farce, with the franchise effectively running the quarterback out of Denver. With his career in freefall, Tomlin tossed Wilson a career lifeline. Still: Even the coach must be a touch surprised by the results. It\u2019s not just what Wilson is doing; it\u2019s how. He is punishing defensive mistakes. He is hitting downfield throws, outside the numbers, at a sky-high clip. What separated Wilson from the pack in Seattle was that he hit atypical throws at a league-leading rate. You know the throw: a deep, arcing moonshot along the sideline. With the Broncos, Wilson\u2019s deep ball vanished. With the Steelers, he\u2019s back to his best. He leads all qualified quarterbacks in Completion Percentage Over Expectation on attempts of 10 air yards or more this season (+15.7%). Wilson has shown a stronger feel for what a game requires, too. His freelancing is less frequent these days, but it\u2019s always there, simmering away in the background if required. Against the Bengals, what was required was ripping apart zone coverages. Cincinnati sagged off Pittsburgh\u2019s receiving corps, hoping to force Wilson to hold the ball long enough that the pass-rush could come screaming home. Wilson in Denver would have acquiesced.

There are still things to nitpick about Wilson\u2019s game, flaws that could be exposed in a close postseason matchup. But he has offset some of his traditional shortcomings \u2013 and has proven deft enough to manage close games. He is, once again, a winning quarterback. Wilson moved to Denver seeking respect. In Pittsburgh, he has found vindication. MVP of the week Jayden Daniels, quarterback, Washington Commanders. So much for Kliff Kingsbury\u2019s offense being found out in the second half of the season. The Commanders raced past the Titans 42-19, jumping out to a 21-0 lead before Tennessee had even run 10 plays. By the time Washington had a four-score lead, the Titans only had 24 yards of offense. It was an important rebound game for Daniels. After the first tricky stretch of his career, Daniels put together the most mature performance of his rookie season. He diced up the Titans\u2019 defense from the pocket, putting together a faultless first half in which he completed 14 of his 15 pass attempts for 105 yards, throwing two touchdowns with no interceptions while ripping off a succession of tight-window throws. More importantly, Daniels showed he is refining his craft as a runner. He is learning to pick his spots, understanding when to slide, and when to embrace contact. Washington\u2019s offense has faltered this season when Daniels has either been injured or limited as a rushing threat. When healthy, upright and able to scamper away from the opposing pass rush, Daniels has torched opposing defenses. Video of the week It\u2019s always a blast when linemen get involved in the scoring. But Sunday was a historic day for the Thicc Six Movement: Seahawks defensive lineman Leonard Williams had the longest return touchdown from a player weighing 300lbs this millennium. Trailing 21-7 to the New York Jets, Williams dropped from his position as a nose tackle out into coverage. The 300lber hauled in the interception at Seattle\u2019s nine-yard line, made a would-be tackler miss and then ran 109.5 yards for the score, maxing out at 17.8 mph on his return. Again, this man is 300lbs! Williams\u2019 pick-six helped swing the game against his former team, turning a potential three-score deficit into a one-score game. Despite a snafu-filled performance, the Seahawks pipped the Jets 26-21, lifting them to the top spot in the NFC West. Stat of the week 70.3%. That\u2019s Justin Tucker\u2019s field-goal percentage this season as his miserable campaign continued against the Eagles. Tucker missed an extra point, a 47-yard field goal and a 53-yard field goal in the Ravens\u2019 24-19 defeat to the Eagles. He is 19-of-27 for the season, and time is running out for one of the league\u2019s all-time greats. The speed of Tucker\u2019s decline is stunning. He was the best kicker in the league for 12 seasons. Now, though, it looks like he has the yips. There is still plenty of velocity on the ball, but his accuracy has vanished. On Sunday, Tucker missed as many or more kicks as he missed in 2012, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2019, or 2021. And it\u2019s not just that he\u2019s fallen below his own lofty standards, he\u2019s become one of the least accurate kickers in recent history: 602 kickers have attempted 25-plus field goals in a season since 2000, Tucker\u2019s 2024 season ranks 576th in made field-goal percentage. Baltimore cannot contend with such an unreliable kicker. It was unfathomable before the start of the season, but to have a shot at winning a championship, the Ravens need to move on from Tucker. Elsewhere around the league Trevor Lawrence was back into the Jaguars\u2019 lineup against the Texans on Sunday after missing the team\u2019s previous two games with a shoulder injury. But Lawrence left the game in the second quarter after a vicious hit from Houston linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair. The linebacker hit a defenseless Lawrence in the head and neck area as the Jags quarterback attempted to slide, the exact kind of tackle the league has tried to legislate out of the game. Lawrence\u2019s head hit the turf and the quarterback appeared to have a \u201cfencing\u201d response, which sparked an on-field melee. Al-Shaair, who has a reputation for dirty hits, was ejected from the game, while Lawrence was ruled out with a head injury. Williams\u2019 pick-six was a highlight for the Seahawks, but the franchise\u2019s special teams dropped one of the worst performances of any unit this season. In the first half alone, Seattle\u2019s special teams fumbled two kick returns, conceded a 99-yard kick return touchdown, had an extra point blocked and muffed a kick.

He threw four interceptions in a 17-13 defeat to the Chargers, including two grizzly picks that helped tilt the game in LA\u2019s favor: one an inexplicable pick-six and the other a baffling decision in the red zone. Cousins\u2019 arm strength has eroded to the point where he can no longer fizz in throws against tight coverage. When the offensive design springs a receiver free, Cousins is slick enough to get the ball out on time. But in physical contests, when Cousins needs to throw his receivers open, he is unable to thread the needle. In his last three games, Cousins has failed to throw a touchdown and has turned the ball over 10 times. The Falcons are on a three-game losing streak and have a negative point differential. Even though they\u2019re still in the playoff hunt, it\u2019s time for the team to see what they have in first-round pick Michael Penix Jr. How good is Josh Allen? He threw and caught this touchdown pass in the Bills\u2019 snowy victory over the 49ers, which clinched Buffalo the AFC East for a fifth-straight season:",

      "body": "<h2>Slot\u2019s heavy hitters floor listless City</h2> <p>Late-2024 Liverpool are reminiscent of the late-2019 team that eventually won the club\u2019s first league title in 30 years. Back then, a 3-1 home win against Manchester City put J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/10/liverpool-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">eight points above second place</a>, and nine above City. In 2024, they are nine points above second and 11 above City \u2013 with, we hope, no pandemic to interrupt the season. There are eight players from that squad still at Liverpool, and if the football is more measured under Arne Slot, Sunday\u2019s potential knockout blow was achieved in the heavy-metal fashion of a Klopp team. \u201cI knew J\u00fcrgen left the team in a very good place,\u201d said the diplomatic Dutchman afterwards. </p> <p>While Slot is enjoying his first Premier League season, Pep Guardiola was subjected to \u201csacked in the morning\u201d chants, another rite of passage for any English football man. Even Sir Alex Ferguson was subjected to it in October 2005, when Middlesbrough <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/oct/31/match.middlesbrough\">crushed his Manchester United team 4-1</a>, a defeat that sparked Roy Keane\u2019s exit. Ferguson dug himself out of the hole with a grinding 1-0 win over Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s Chelsea. Guardiola hoped for similar at Anfield but his battered squad appears incapable of letting fly any dogs of war. At Anfield, City were punchless, while the same defensive mistakes of recent weeks were still evident. \u201cIf I don\u2019t want that pressure, I resign, go home and I don\u2019t have this weight on my shoulders,\u201d said Guardiola before the match. Is a Keane-esque sacrificial victim required? Kevin De Bruyne\u2019s fringe role continues to intrigue. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/01/liverpool-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Liverpool 2-0 Manchester City</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Set-piece gurus face off in London derby</h2> <p>The cult of the set-piece specialist grows apace. One noted Premier League corner and free-kick coach was recently spied signing an autograph outside a stadium. At West Ham, Nicolas Jover\u2019s \u201cblitz\u201d call for Arsenal\u2019s opener, a move they repeated through the first half, caught the eye. And when Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es nodded in, Pablo Sanz, who looks after West Ham\u2019s set-piece detail, looked aghast. Though the NFL-style move was being shown off in public for the first time, Julen Lopetegui said he and Sanz had been fully prepared. In Lopetegui\u2019s view, the goal should not have stood after Jurri\u00ebn Timber\u2019s block on Lucas Paquet\u00e1. And it was tough to see how the video assistant referee had missed a clear offence, even among a seething mass of bodies. It can only be imagined what Mikel Arteta\u2019s reaction might have been had his team been the recipients. Back to the drawing board for Jover? Officialdom will surely be mindful next time. <strong>JB</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/30/west-ham-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">West Ham 2-5 Arsenal</a></em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Fern\u00e1ndez finally shows his value</h2> <p>Life is better when your \u00a3106.7m midfielder finally looks worth the money. It is fair to say that Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez has taken his time. The Argentina international joined Chelsea in January 2023, a month after helping his country win the World Cup, and struggled to live up to the hype at first. A series of underwhelming performances raised doubts over Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s suitability to English football. Eyebrows were raised further when he had hernia surgery at the end of last season and Chelsea improved in his absence. This campaign has also featured a spell on the bench, but Fern\u00e1ndez has responded. He has regained his starting spot and scored his second goal in as many games in Chelsea\u2019s win over Aston Villa. He is listening to Enzo Maresca\u2019s demand for him to make more forward runs and has also come up with a lot of important assists. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/01/chelsea-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\">Chelsea 3-0 Aston Villa</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Everton abandon Dycheian principles</h2> <p>In suffering a 4-0 defeat to Manchester United, Everton were a quaint, anti-Sean Dyche football proposition, sloppiness allowing their hosts to mug them too often. Example: Amad Diallo\u2019s smash-and-grab on the visitors\u2019 captain, James Tarkowski, that led to Joshua Zirkzee\u2019s second goal. As Dyche said: \u201cIt is a real hard one for me to take today because we were attacking for their first goal and then got countered on. I was very surprised to go 1-0 down in that way and then it was a glaring mistake. I thought in the first 30 minutes we were good in most ways. The next challenge is that final pass or finish \u2013 that is the hardest bit to change. The third goal is madness from our perspective, and it is such an important goal anywhere in the Premier League.\u201d <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/01/manchester-united-everton-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester United 4-0 Everton</a></em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Will Son shine again for Spurs?</h2> <p>Son Heung-min has scored three league goals so far this season and registered four assists. There\u2019s no reason to panic, but two of those goals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/24/tottenham-everton-premier-league-match-report\">came against Everton</a> and one against West Ham in comfortable wins. He has not been as incisive as in previous seasons. At 32, there is perhaps a sense that, while he still has much to contribute, the slow downturn has begun. \u201cI don\u2019t have a sense from him that he\u2019s worried about it,\u201d said Ange Postecoglou. \u201cWe\u2019ve had different players go through those spells. The key is to maintain our focus and not worry too much about what\u2019s gone before. I\u2019m sure the goals will flow again.\u201d What is clearly true is that Son is much more comfortable playing on the left rather than through the middle, and that the absence of Dominic Solanke and Richarlison makes it harder for Tottenham to retain and recycle possession, making them much more reliant on transitions. <strong>Jonathan Wilson</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/01/tottenham-fulham-premier-league-match-report\">Tottenham 1-1 Fulham</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Repeated fouling of Evanilson fells Wolves</h2> <p>If Justin Kluivert\u2019s hat-trick of penalties for Bournemouth created history, then Evanilson\u2019s role in being fouled for all three did too, as he became the first individual to win three penalties in a single Premier League game. \u201cCrazy ... crazy ... crazy,\u201d said Gary O\u2019Neil, when asked about his team\u2019s defending. After an unbeaten run of four matches, and the previous week\u2019s 4-1 demolition of Fulham, came a return to the chaotic defending and poor decision-making of earlier in the season. The manager had opted for the same formation and approach that was so successful at Fulham. \u201cIf we had the game back again we\u2019d try something different,\u201d he admitted, having his own, possibly fateful contribution to the craziness that sank his team. Perhaps Mario Lemina, deployed at centre-back here, isn\u2019t a defender after all. <strong>JB</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/30/wolves-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">Wolves 2-4 Bournemouth</a></em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Brentford build fortress without Toney</h2> <p>Brentford have turned their home ground into a fortress this season, dispatching opponents with impressive ease under the guidance of Thomas Frank. The manager\u2019s ability to integrate a talent such as Kevin Schade and rotate attacking players answers those critics who attributed his previous success to Ivan Toney\u2019s goals. Without the England forward, Brentford have now scored three or more goals in four consecutive home league matches for the first time since 1984, and sit top of the league\u2019s home table. \u201cI think I have some good challenges because I have a lot of good offensive players that want to play,\u201d said Frank. \u201cWe went very offensive. We played with four wingers and strikers plus the No 10 in Mikkel Damsgaard but, because all of them play high up, they worked very hard.\u201d Defeats at Liverpool, Manchester City and Tottenham highlight the gap to the top teams but Brentford, now in eighth, may even start to bridge it in the second half of the season. <strong>Yara El-Shaboury</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/30/brentford-leicester-premier-league-match-report\">Brentford 4-1 Leicester</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Magpies misplace their shooting boots</h2> <p>Eddie Howe is right to be concerned. Even though the Newcastle manager seemed hopeful the hip injury sustained by Alexander Isak at Crystal Palace may not be serious, his side\u2019s lack of goals has become a major issue. While they were almost able to snatch a victory at Selhurst Park after profiting from Marc Gu\u00e9hi\u2019s own goal, they offered little else in attack and have managed only 14 goals in 13 Premier League matches. The return of Callum Wilson should help but Howe said he may have to work on his team\u2019s confidence in front of goal before hosting the leaders, Liverpool, on Wednesday. \u201cIn football confidence is very fragile and is something we have to protect at all costs,\u201d he said. \u201cI back the players because we know they have the ability and we\u2019ve got to try and get them in their best form. That\u2019s always a delicate thing as well, you want them in form at the same time, and we haven\u2019t had that this season.\u201d <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/30/crystal-palace-newcastle-premier-league-match-report\">Crystal Palace 1-1 Newcastle</a></em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Silva stars in Forest\u2019s cohort of wingers</h2> <p>After a previous scattergun approach to recruitment, Jota Silva is evidence there is a serious methodology to the way Nottingham Forest do transfer business now. The Portuguese winger arrived from Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es this summer for \u00a36.5m and has shown glimpses of having talent worthy of a higher price. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo gave him his first Premier League start, after 11 substitute appearances, on Saturday against Ipswich.

      "bodyText": "Slot\u2019s heavy hitters floor listless City Late-2024 Liverpool are reminiscent of the late-2019 team that eventually won the club\u2019s first league title in 30 years. Back then, a 3-1 home win against Manchester City put J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side eight points above second place, and nine above City. In 2024, they are nine points above second and 11 above City \u2013 with, we hope, no pandemic to interrupt the season. There are eight players from that squad still at Liverpool, and if the football is more measured under Arne Slot, Sunday\u2019s potential knockout blow was achieved in the heavy-metal fashion of a Klopp team. \u201cI knew J\u00fcrgen left the team in a very good place,\u201d said the diplomatic Dutchman afterwards. While Slot is enjoying his first Premier League season, Pep Guardiola was subjected to \u201csacked in the morning\u201d chants, another rite of passage for any English football man. Even Sir Alex Ferguson was subjected to it in October 2005, when Middlesbrough crushed his Manchester United team 4-1, a defeat that sparked Roy Keane\u2019s exit. Ferguson dug himself out of the hole with a grinding 1-0 win over Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s Chelsea. Guardiola hoped for similar at Anfield but his battered squad appears incapable of letting fly any dogs of war. At Anfield, City were punchless, while the same defensive mistakes of recent weeks were still evident. \u201cIf I don\u2019t want that pressure, I resign, go home and I don\u2019t have this weight on my shoulders,\u201d said Guardiola before the match. Is a Keane-esque sacrificial victim required? Kevin De Bruyne\u2019s fringe role continues to intrigue. John Brewin Match report: Liverpool 2-0 Manchester City Set-piece gurus face off in London derby The cult of the set-piece specialist grows apace. One noted Premier League corner and free-kick coach was recently spied signing an autograph outside a stadium. At West Ham, Nicolas Jover\u2019s \u201cblitz\u201d call for Arsenal\u2019s opener, a move they repeated through the first half, caught the eye. And when Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es nodded in, Pablo Sanz, who looks after West Ham\u2019s set-piece detail, looked aghast. Though the NFL-style move was being shown off in public for the first time, Julen Lopetegui said he and Sanz had been fully prepared. In Lopetegui\u2019s view, the goal should not have stood after Jurri\u00ebn Timber\u2019s block on Lucas Paquet\u00e1. And it was tough to see how the video assistant referee had missed a clear offence, even among a seething mass of bodies. It can only be imagined what Mikel Arteta\u2019s reaction might have been had his team been the recipients. Back to the drawing board for Jover? Officialdom will surely be mindful next time. JB Match report: West Ham 2-5 Arsenal Fern\u00e1ndez finally shows his value Life is better when your \u00a3106.7m midfielder finally looks worth the money. It is fair to say that Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez has taken his time. The Argentina international joined Chelsea in January 2023, a month after helping his country win the World Cup, and struggled to live up to the hype at first. A series of underwhelming performances raised doubts over Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s suitability to English football. Eyebrows were raised further when he had hernia surgery at the end of last season and Chelsea improved in his absence. This campaign has also featured a spell on the bench, but Fern\u00e1ndez has responded. He has regained his starting spot and scored his second goal in as many games in Chelsea\u2019s win over Aston Villa. He is listening to Enzo Maresca\u2019s demand for him to make more forward runs and has also come up with a lot of important assists. Jacob Steinberg Match report: Chelsea 3-0 Aston Villa Everton abandon Dycheian principles In suffering a 4-0 defeat to Manchester United, Everton were a quaint, anti-Sean Dyche football proposition, sloppiness allowing their hosts to mug them too often. Example: Amad Diallo\u2019s smash-and-grab on the visitors\u2019 captain, James Tarkowski, that led to Joshua Zirkzee\u2019s second goal. As Dyche said: \u201cIt is a real hard one for me to take today because we were attacking for their first goal and then got countered on. I was very surprised to go 1-0 down in that way and then it was a glaring mistake. I thought in the first 30 minutes we were good in most ways. The next challenge is that final pass or finish \u2013 that is the hardest bit to change. The third goal is madness from our perspective, and it is such an important goal anywhere in the Premier League.\u201d Jamie Jackson Match report: Manchester United 4-0 Everton Will Son shine again for Spurs? Son Heung-min has scored three league goals so far this season and registered four assists. There\u2019s no reason to panic, but two of those goals came against Everton and one against West Ham in comfortable wins. He has not been as incisive as in previous seasons. At 32, there is perhaps a sense that, while he still has much to contribute, the slow downturn has begun. \u201cI don\u2019t have a sense from him that he\u2019s worried about it,\u201d said Ange Postecoglou. \u201cWe\u2019ve had different players go through those spells. The key is to maintain our focus and not worry too much about what\u2019s gone before. I\u2019m sure the goals will flow again.\u201d What is clearly true is that Son is much more comfortable playing on the left rather than through the middle, and that the absence of Dominic Solanke and Richarlison makes it harder for Tottenham to retain and recycle possession, making them much more reliant on transitions. Jonathan Wilson Match report: Tottenham 1-1 Fulham Repeated fouling of Evanilson fells Wolves If Justin Kluivert\u2019s hat-trick of penalties for Bournemouth created history, then Evanilson\u2019s role in being fouled for all three did too, as he became the first individual to win three penalties in a single Premier League game. \u201cCrazy ... crazy ... crazy,\u201d said Gary O\u2019Neil, when asked about his team\u2019s defending. After an unbeaten run of four matches, and the previous week\u2019s 4-1 demolition of Fulham, came a return to the chaotic defending and poor decision-making of earlier in the season. The manager had opted for the same formation and approach that was so successful at Fulham. \u201cIf we had the game back again we\u2019d try something different,\u201d he admitted, having his own, possibly fateful contribution to the craziness that sank his team. Perhaps Mario Lemina, deployed at centre-back here, isn\u2019t a defender after all. JB Match report: Wolves 2-4 Bournemouth Brentford build fortress without Toney Brentford have turned their home ground into a fortress this season, dispatching opponents with impressive ease under the guidance of Thomas Frank. The manager\u2019s ability to integrate a talent such as Kevin Schade and rotate attacking players answers those critics who attributed his previous success to Ivan Toney\u2019s goals. Without the England forward, Brentford have now scored three or more goals in four consecutive home league matches for the first time since 1984, and sit top of the league\u2019s home table. \u201cI think I have some good challenges because I have a lot of good offensive players that want to play,\u201d said Frank. \u201cWe went very offensive. We played with four wingers and strikers plus the No 10 in Mikkel Damsgaard but, because all of them play high up, they worked very hard.\u201d Defeats at Liverpool, Manchester City and Tottenham highlight the gap to the top teams but Brentford, now in eighth, may even start to bridge it in the second half of the season. Yara El-Shaboury Match report: Brentford 4-1 Leicester Magpies misplace their shooting boots Eddie Howe is right to be concerned. Even though the Newcastle manager seemed hopeful the hip injury sustained by Alexander Isak at Crystal Palace may not be serious, his side\u2019s lack of goals has become a major issue. While they were almost able to snatch a victory at Selhurst Park after profiting from Marc Gu\u00e9hi\u2019s own goal, they offered little else in attack and have managed only 14 goals in 13 Premier League matches. The return of Callum Wilson should help but Howe said he may have to work on his team\u2019s confidence in front of goal before hosting the leaders, Liverpool, on Wednesday. \u201cIn football confidence is very fragile and is something we have to protect at all costs,\u201d he said. \u201cI back the players because we know they have the ability and we\u2019ve got to try and get them in their best form. That\u2019s always a delicate thing as well, you want them in form at the same time, and we haven\u2019t had that this season.\u201d Ed Aarons Match report: Crystal Palace 1-1 Newcastle Silva stars in Forest\u2019s cohort of wingers After a previous scattergun approach to recruitment, Jota Silva is evidence there is a serious methodology to the way Nottingham Forest do transfer business now. The Portuguese winger arrived from Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es this summer for \u00a36.5m and has shown glimpses of having talent worthy of a higher price. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo gave him his first Premier League start, after 11 substitute appearances, on Saturday against Ipswich. From the first minute he showed speed and energy to cause the visitors problems. He also earned the match-winning penalty, admittedly in theatrical style, but it was an indication of the threat he posed. Considering Forest\u2019s cohort of wingers includes Callum Hudson-Odoi, Anthony Elanga and Ram\u00f3n Sosa, there is plenty of depth in a key area for Nuno as they hope to maintain momentum.

This term, the largest live audience for a WSL game on YouTube was the 271,502 who tuned in to Manchester United\u2019s victory at Leicester City on 17 November, whereas the highest figure for a game on FA Player last season was Arsenal v Bristol City which attracted 78,050 live viewers.",

Serves about 20 lemons 2 clementines 3 cinnamon sticks 2 cloves 6 star anise 2 cardamom pods 2, lightly crushed with the flat of a large knife vanilla pods 2, split lengthways fresh ginger 50g, finely chopped good, dry cider 4 litres dark brown sugar 500g, or less, to taste Peel the lemon in large strips, being careful to leave behind as much of the pith as possible. Peel the clementines, reserving the flesh. In a heavy-based frying pan over a very low heat, toast the lemon peel, clementine peel, cinnamon, cloves, star anise, cardamom, vanilla and ginger for about 10 minutes, constantly moving everything around in the pan so nothing can catch and burn.

Add the remaining tablespoon of Greek yoghurt if it is still a little thick. Cook the prawns by placing a large frying pan on a high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and fry the prawns for 2-3 minutes on each side, until just cooked through and golden all over. Leave to cool a little.

Taste, adjust the seasoning to your liking, adding more wasabi if you want more of a punch. Spoon a heaped teaspoon of the mixture on to each blini, then a slice of cucumber, then top with a bite-sized piece of smoked salmon, a few salmon eggs if you are using them and a piece of cress. Squeeze the remaining lemon over all the blinis just before serving. For the egg and mayonnaise topping, bring a small pan of water to the boil. Mix together the mayonnaise, grated garlic and the mustard. Beat together well, then stir in the chopped herbs. When the pan of water is boiling, pop in the eggs and boil for 7 minutes. Drain immediately and plunge into cold water. When they are cool enough, peel off the shells and place on kitchen paper so they are completely dry. Cut each egg into quarters and season. Top each blini with a heaped teaspoon of the herby mayonnaise, a \u00bc of an egg and finished with a crisp or two. For the feta and prawn topping, place the prawns in a mixing bowl and sprinkle over the sweet smoked paprika, dried oregano, chilli flakes, grated garlic and lemon zest. Pour over 2 tablespoons of olive oil and mix together well until all coated. You can cook the prawns straight away, or you can marinate, covered, in the fridge. Leave them for a good few hours if you can. Blitz the feta, 4 tablespoons of the Greek yoghurt and half of the lemon juice in a food processor until smooth (don\u2019t use a blender, as the mixture will become liquid, you want to create a paste). Add the remaining tablespoon of Greek yoghurt if it is still a little thick. Cook the prawns by placing a large frying pan on a high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and fry the prawns for 2-3 minutes on each side, until just cooked through and golden all over. Leave to cool a little. Serve by spooning a heaped teaspoon of the feta mixture on to each blini, and topping with a prawn, the grated lemon zest and a leaf or two of parsley.

Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian\u2019s defence and security editor, has written about Syrian rebels\u2019 stunning takeover of Aleppo amid deteriorating Russian military support for the regime of Bashar al-Assad. \u201cIt was not Kyiv that fell in three days, but Aleppo \u2026 Russia is not the force it was in Syria in the last decade, because Moscow has shifted its military focus and resources to its invasion of Ukraine.\u201d Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, has accused China of providing Russia with weapons for its war against Ukraine and threatening peace in Europe and the Indo-Pacific. \u201cInstead of taking responsibility for peace and security in the world as a permanent member of the UN security council, China is opposing our core European interests with its economic and weapons aid to Russia,\u201d said Baerbock, who will travel to China next week to meet with her counterpart, Wang Yi, and discuss issues including the war in Ukraine. \u201cPutin\u2019s brutal war of aggression against Ukraine is a direct threat to our peace,\u201d Baerbock said. \u201cI will also speak in Beijing about the fact that we cannot simply ignore this in our relations with China.\u201d The war in Ukraine showed how security in Europe was inextricably linked with that in Asia, Baerbock said. \u201cIf North Korea sends soldiers and weapons against Ukraine, while Russia supports Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear programme, then this jeopardises peace both here and in the Indo-Pacific,\u201d Baerbock said. The US is not considering restoring to Ukraine the nuclear weapons capability it gave up after the Soviet Union collapsed, the White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on Sunday. It follows a New York Times article that said some unidentified western officials had suggested Joe Biden could do so. \u201cThat is not under consideration, no. What we are doing is surging various conventional capacities to Ukraine so that they can effectively defend themselves and take the fight to the Russians, not nuclear capability,\u201d Sullivan told US network ABC. The world\u2019s 100 biggest defence equipment makers increased their arms sales by 4.2% in 2023 to US$632bn, fuelled by wars and regional tensions, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) said on Monday. US groups on Sipri\u2019s list grew sales by 2.5% in total compared with the year before to $317bn. Market leaders Lockheed Martin and RTX however saw slightly lower arms sales. European companies on the list \u2013 excluding Russian \u2013 had roughly unchanged combined sales in 2023 at $133bn but order intake surged and some groups saw a surge in demand linked to the war in Ukraine.",

      "body": "<p>Edwin Frank vows in his introduction to this book to try to do for the fiction of the last century what the critic Alex Ross\u2019s landmark book <em>The Rest </em><em>Is Noise</em> did for its music. He is as good as his word. This is the most engaging imagining of the progress of the 20th-century novel you will read. Frank brings serious erudition to the task \u2013 in his day job he is editorial director of New York Review Books and has for 25 years edited its eclectic classics series which breathes new life into half-forgotten or out-of-print treasures. Though he has a fine critical judgment, Frank writes as an enthusiast at least as much as an academic, trusting his taste, always alive to the stories he is telling and the arguments he makes.</p> <p>His method is broadly chronological, offering the reader a \u201clong\u201d 20th century, beginning with Dostoevsky\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/notes-from-underground-9780393870862/\">Notes from Underground</a></em> (1864) and concluding with WG Sebald\u2019s <em>Austerlitz</em> (2001). The choice of those two particular bookends to his study of 30-odd examples of the modern novel gives some idea of the emphasis of the project and the interests of the author. He is drawn to books that challenge the form itself in different ways, those that self-consciously or otherwise disrupt the more stately certainties of the great 19th-century novels. \u201cThe writers of the 20th century are ambushed by history,\u201d Frank writes. \u201cThey exist in a world where the dynamic balance between self and society that the 19th-century novel sought to maintain can no longer be maintained, even as fiction.\u201d</p> <p>If Dostoevsky\u2019s \u201cunclassifiable\u201d book \u2013 the structure of which resembles \u201cnothing so much as a swept-up heap of broken glass\u201d \u2013 set the pattern of that new relationship, Frank\u2019s subsequent inquiries celebrate how the novel form became the place where changing ideas of fictional consciousness were tried out for size \u2013 from Gertrude Stein\u2019s adventures with character as language in <em>Three Lives</em> to VS Naipaul\u2019s restless examinations of post-colonial identity in <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-enigma-of-arrival-9780330522861/\">The Enigma of Arrival</a></em>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Frank champions the 20th-century novel as the ultimate hybrid form, somewhere between memoir, history and myth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Frank sometimes uses unlikely pairs of books to illustrate the ways very different writers responded to similar contemporary pressures \u2013 placing distinct confessionals such as Colette\u2019s <em>Claudine at School</em> and Rudyard Kipling\u2019s <em>Kim</em> alongside each other, for example, or finding the parallels between discrete experiments like Italo Svevo\u2019s <em>Confessions of Zeno</em> and Jean Rhys\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/good-morning-midnight-9780141183930/\">Good Morning, Midnight</a></em>. In other chapters, he focuses on individual novels: <em>Mrs Dalloway</em> \u2013 Virginia Woolf\u2019s riposte to the \u201cvulgarities\u201d of <em>Ulysses</em> \u2013 or Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em>, the magic of whose realism, he suggests, in part lay in the fact that it was living proof of \u201cthe triumphant march of the 20th-century novel across the whole world\u201d.</p> <p>Frank follows the threads of that literary colonisation which advanced as empires themselves were retreating. His attention ranges far and wide, to Chinua Achebe\u2019s <em>Things </em><em>F</em><em>all Apar</em><em>t</em>, and Anna Banti\u2019s <em>Artemisia</em> (there are only four American writers who make headline acts: Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, Vladimir Nabokov and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/14/colson-whitehead-when-i-read-invisible-man-i-thought-maybe-theres-room-for-a-black-weirdo-like-me\">Ralph Ellison</a>).

      "bodyText": "Edwin Frank vows in his introduction to this book to try to do for the fiction of the last century what the critic Alex Ross\u2019s landmark book The Rest Is Noise did for its music. He is as good as his word. This is the most engaging imagining of the progress of the 20th-century novel you will read. Frank brings serious erudition to the task \u2013 in his day job he is editorial director of New York Review Books and has for 25 years edited its eclectic classics series which breathes new life into half-forgotten or out-of-print treasures. Though he has a fine critical judgment, Frank writes as an enthusiast at least as much as an academic, trusting his taste, always alive to the stories he is telling and the arguments he makes. His method is broadly chronological, offering the reader a \u201clong\u201d 20th century, beginning with Dostoevsky\u2019s Notes from Underground (1864) and concluding with WG Sebald\u2019s Austerlitz (2001). The choice of those two particular bookends to his study of 30-odd examples of the modern novel gives some idea of the emphasis of the project and the interests of the author. He is drawn to books that challenge the form itself in different ways, those that self-consciously or otherwise disrupt the more stately certainties of the great 19th-century novels. \u201cThe writers of the 20th century are ambushed by history,\u201d Frank writes. \u201cThey exist in a world where the dynamic balance between self and society that the 19th-century novel sought to maintain can no longer be maintained, even as fiction.\u201d If Dostoevsky\u2019s \u201cunclassifiable\u201d book \u2013 the structure of which resembles \u201cnothing so much as a swept-up heap of broken glass\u201d \u2013 set the pattern of that new relationship, Frank\u2019s subsequent inquiries celebrate how the novel form became the place where changing ideas of fictional consciousness were tried out for size \u2013 from Gertrude Stein\u2019s adventures with character as language in Three Lives to VS Naipaul\u2019s restless examinations of post-colonial identity in The Enigma of Arrival. Frank sometimes uses unlikely pairs of books to illustrate the ways very different writers responded to similar contemporary pressures \u2013 placing distinct confessionals such as Colette\u2019s Claudine at School and Rudyard Kipling\u2019s Kim alongside each other, for example, or finding the parallels between discrete experiments like Italo Svevo\u2019s Confessions of Zeno and Jean Rhys\u2019s Good Morning, Midnight. In other chapters, he focuses on individual novels: Mrs Dalloway \u2013 Virginia Woolf\u2019s riposte to the \u201cvulgarities\u201d of Ulysses \u2013 or Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s One Hundred Years of Solitude, the magic of whose realism, he suggests, in part lay in the fact that it was living proof of \u201cthe triumphant march of the 20th-century novel across the whole world\u201d. Frank follows the threads of that literary colonisation which advanced as empires themselves were retreating. His attention ranges far and wide, to Chinua Achebe\u2019s Things Fall Apart, and Anna Banti\u2019s Artemisia (there are only four American writers who make headline acts: Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, Vladimir Nabokov and Ralph Ellison). As a critic, he is not seduced by labels \u2013 isms get short shrift. He champions the 20th-century novel as the ultimate hybrid \u201cmisbegotten\u201d form, existing somewhere between memoir and history and myth and gives a thumbs up to poet Randall Jarrell\u2019s catch-all description: \u201cA novel is a prose narrative of a certain length with something wrong with it.\u201d If the writers share a fatal flaw, he suggests, it is a belief that the novel \u201cmatters immensely\u201d and is undone by that fact. \u201cTo read them,\u201d he writes, \u201cis to catch them in the act of thinking about the novel in the midst of writing a novel\u2026 they write both as novelist and as critic writing over the novelist\u2019s shoulder.\u201d That schism, he argues, was rendered by the Great War and its effect on the European imagination, a fact articulated in the triumvirate of novels \u2013 Ulysses, In Search of Lost Time, and The Magic Mountain \u2013 that were conceived or begun before 1914 and entirely altered by what followed.

      "body": "<p>A wave of vicious anti-migrant protests in Dublin and beyond, including arson attacks on property earmarked for asylum seekers, and an emerging far right have posed challenges for the Irish government in the past year.</p> <p>In the seaside resort of Courtown, 100km (60 miles) south of Dublin, residents have shown there is another way, one full of humanity and support for people fleeing conflict or persecution.</p> <p>A hotel here houses about 200 male refugees and asylum seekers including a doctor, a vet, and an engineer who speaks five languages.</p> <p>This is their story.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Mikie (not quoted), from Nigeria, on Courtown beach in July</p></li> </ul> <p>It was sheer luck that Baba William got passage on the boat, and sheer luck that he survived. His flatmate in Libya, also from South Sudan, originally got the call from the people smugglers to make his way to the Libyan shore to help pilot the boat across the Mediterranean. \u201cHe was sick and said \u2018you go\u2019,\u201d William says. He didn\u2019t know how to drive the boat but knew how to use GPS from years working with his father, a fisher.</p> <p>\u201cWe were moved at four in the morning and then I started praying and praying. There were 85 people on the boat,\u201d he says. It was his first attempt to get to Europe. \u201cI had one guy also from South Sudan beside me who had tried nine times.\u201d</p> <p>He continues: \u201cWe were three days at sea. We were trying to get close to Lampedusa and then the engine stopped. We had no fuel. Fishing boats were coming near us but they were saying they couldn\u2019t help us. They asked us what we needed and they threw us bread and water. We had a phone and we kept ringing the emergency number for Italy.\u201d </p>    <ul> <li><p>Baba William on Courtown beach</p></li> </ul>    <p>Eventually they were rescued by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) and ended up at the Italian port of Bari. Having said goodbye to the dangers of life under militia in South Sudan and then Libya, he couldn\u2019t believe how hard it was in Italy, which that year received 105,000 people on boats operated by people smugglers.</p> <p>He sustained himself by working illegally harvesting olives in the dead of night, for which he was paid \u20ac40 (\u00a333) for an eight-hour shift, until he was selected for an official Irish refugee relocation programme and was one of 21 people flown to Dublin two years ago.</p> <p>Born in Khartoum, William, 29, recalls the perennially dangerous life back home as civil war broke out. \u201cIt was not safe,\u201d he says. \u201cEven now people are scared. You don\u2019t know what is going to happen to you in the night or if you are walking on the street. You go to work and you might not come back. People just disappear. And you can\u2019t find out who is taking the people, who is killing the people.\u201d</p>    <ul> <li><p>Bar\u00e9 fled war in Somalia after being shot.</p></li> </ul>    <ul> <li><p>The main common room and dining room at the hotel.</p></li> </ul> <p>Bar\u00e9, a doctor from Somalia who got his refugee papers a year ago, talks of his relief at being in Ireland, even if by law he cannot practise medicine. \u201cThere are no militia in Ireland. It is very safe here. You can speak freely here,\u201d he says, underlining freedoms that people in democracies often take for granted.</p> <p>Explaining how he came to be thousands of miles from home, he lifts his peaked cap to reveal a horseshoe-shaped scar on his skull from a rifle butt. He also has a large scar from a bullet wound he took during an ambush by militia near Mogadishu in which his friend was shot dead.</p> <p>\u201cI was working with medical people and they captured us, me and a logistics guy who was driving,\u201d he says. \u201cThey said they had to take the car, they shot him and hit me on the head and shot me. You can see the shape of the rifle. I was in a coma for four days and taken to prison, but someone helped me get out.\u201d</p> <p>He went to a refugee camp in Ethiopia, later got a visa for the UK, and stayed in London for about two years but realised it was \u201cno good\u201d for him. A fellow Somalian he had met suggested he could get to Ireland via Belfast.</p> <p>\u201cI like Courtown,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are very welcoming, helpful to refugees. If my family come here I will be so happy.\u201d</p>    <ul> <li><p>Mohamed and a roommate in the hotel</p></li> </ul>    <ul> <li><p>Mohamed at a bus stop in Courtown</p></li> </ul> <p>Mohamed, an Algerian vet, also arrived in Courtown via London and Belfast. He says: \u201cWhen I was in Algeria I did not know what asylum was. I did not know about Ireland or where it was. I just wanted to leave Algeria. I did my military service and started work at the same time but also started looking for a visa. I tried France, Germany, Italy, Canada, US over 10 years and eventually got a visa to the UK. I didn\u2019t tell my mum or my dad, just my brother I was going.\u201d</p> <p>After 11 days in London in a hostel, he was advised by someone he had met while looking for a house share that he would be better off applying for asylum in Ireland and could go without papers via Belfast. \u201cI met someone who had been 10 years in London without papers, another 12 years, that\u2019s why I started thinking about Ireland,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Like Bar\u00e9, he has been unable to practise his profession because of different qualification standards, but he moved quickly to involve himself in local life, working in a charity shop to occupy himself six days a week, and he now works as a barista in nearby Gorey.</p> <p>\u201cThings were bad in Algeria,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel good and I just needed to leave. I didn\u2019t mind where. I was happy when I got England because it is famous. One of my friends say if England is not good there is a chance to go to Ireland. I had never heard this information before.\u201d</p>    <ul> <li><p>Emmanuel (not quoted) in his room in the hotel in Courtown</p></li> </ul> <p>A bouncy, chirpy character, Mohamed says he may be sad inside over the traumas at home but outside he is \u201calways happy\u201d. He is currently waiting for his second interview in relation to his asylum application and says he is an optimist. Fluent in Arabic and French and improving his English, he wants to take exams to work as a vet again and build a future.</p> <p>Also in the hotel is Theron, a young South African journalism graduate who came to Ireland to escape persecution, including after attending a pride march with a friend in the township of Alexandra. He says he received death threats and was mugged multiple times, and felt unsafe in a country known to have an inadequate police force and whose murder rates are at a 20-year high.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Theron in his bedroom at the hotel</p></li> </ul> <p>Theron\u2019s mother now lives in the UK with a sibling but he was not eligible to join them as he was no longer a minor. Not knowing what else to do, he sought refuge in Ireland in the hope he could be near his family.</p> <p>Courtown is \u201cvery peaceful\u201d, he says. \u201cPeople take care of each other. There are always activities and people ask us to help and they provide us with a few interesting things to do.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cI\u2019ve never felt threatened or hated. I\u2019ve haven\u2019t been called any names,\u201d though he says some of his friends closer to Dublin had to \u201ccancel some of their plans\u201d around the time of the anti-immigration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/24/anger-immigration-riot-dublin-ireland\">riots in November last year</a>.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Theron in his room</p></li> </ul> <p>Why has Courtown been so successful in integrating asylum seekers and how did it escape the kind of anger and abuse captured in a recent RT\u00c9 documentary, Inside the Protests. People in the town say it is largely down to the integrated support offered by residents, the gardai, transport operators, the library, the football club.</p> <p>\u201cLooking at that programme, I can\u2019t get over what I was seeing. It was shocking, it was frightening,\u201d Carmel, a local shopkeeper, says of the documentary. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had problems with people here. They are nice, friendly, always say good morning and thank you, a lot of them can work, they are working, buying Irish cars, and putting money into the local economy.\u201d</p>    <ul> <li><p>Donny, who works in a local store</p></li> </ul> <p>Donny, who works in the same store, says of the arrivals: \u201cPersonally I think it is good. We learn something from them. Some people feel they are losing the Irish heritage because they can\u2019t sing the national anthem.

      "bodyText": "A wave of vicious anti-migrant protests in Dublin and beyond, including arson attacks on property earmarked for asylum seekers, and an emerging far right have posed challenges for the Irish government in the past year. In the seaside resort of Courtown, 100km (60 miles) south of Dublin, residents have shown there is another way, one full of humanity and support for people fleeing conflict or persecution. A hotel here houses about 200 male refugees and asylum seekers including a doctor, a vet, and an engineer who speaks five languages. This is their story. Mikie (not quoted), from Nigeria, on Courtown beach in July It was sheer luck that Baba William got passage on the boat, and sheer luck that he survived. His flatmate in Libya, also from South Sudan, originally got the call from the people smugglers to make his way to the Libyan shore to help pilot the boat across the Mediterranean. \u201cHe was sick and said \u2018you go\u2019,\u201d William says. He didn\u2019t know how to drive the boat but knew how to use GPS from years working with his father, a fisher. \u201cWe were moved at four in the morning and then I started praying and praying. There were 85 people on the boat,\u201d he says. It was his first attempt to get to Europe. \u201cI had one guy also from South Sudan beside me who had tried nine times.\u201d He continues: \u201cWe were three days at sea. We were trying to get close to Lampedusa and then the engine stopped. We had no fuel. Fishing boats were coming near us but they were saying they couldn\u2019t help us. They asked us what we needed and they threw us bread and water. We had a phone and we kept ringing the emergency number for Italy.\u201d Baba William on Courtown beach Eventually they were rescued by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) and ended up at the Italian port of Bari. Having said goodbye to the dangers of life under militia in South Sudan and then Libya, he couldn\u2019t believe how hard it was in Italy, which that year received 105,000 people on boats operated by people smugglers. He sustained himself by working illegally harvesting olives in the dead of night, for which he was paid \u20ac40 (\u00a333) for an eight-hour shift, until he was selected for an official Irish refugee relocation programme and was one of 21 people flown to Dublin two years ago. Born in Khartoum, William, 29, recalls the perennially dangerous life back home as civil war broke out. \u201cIt was not safe,\u201d he says. \u201cEven now people are scared. You don\u2019t know what is going to happen to you in the night or if you are walking on the street. You go to work and you might not come back. People just disappear. And you can\u2019t find out who is taking the people, who is killing the people.\u201d Bar\u00e9 fled war in Somalia after being shot. The main common room and dining room at the hotel. Bar\u00e9, a doctor from Somalia who got his refugee papers a year ago, talks of his relief at being in Ireland, even if by law he cannot practise medicine. \u201cThere are no militia in Ireland. It is very safe here. You can speak freely here,\u201d he says, underlining freedoms that people in democracies often take for granted. Explaining how he came to be thousands of miles from home, he lifts his peaked cap to reveal a horseshoe-shaped scar on his skull from a rifle butt. He also has a large scar from a bullet wound he took during an ambush by militia near Mogadishu in which his friend was shot dead. \u201cI was working with medical people and they captured us, me and a logistics guy who was driving,\u201d he says. \u201cThey said they had to take the car, they shot him and hit me on the head and shot me. You can see the shape of the rifle. I was in a coma for four days and taken to prison, but someone helped me get out.\u201d He went to a refugee camp in Ethiopia, later got a visa for the UK, and stayed in London for about two years but realised it was \u201cno good\u201d for him. A fellow Somalian he had met suggested he could get to Ireland via Belfast. \u201cI like Courtown,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are very welcoming, helpful to refugees. If my family come here I will be so happy.\u201d Mohamed and a roommate in the hotel Mohamed at a bus stop in Courtown Mohamed, an Algerian vet, also arrived in Courtown via London and Belfast. He says: \u201cWhen I was in Algeria I did not know what asylum was. I did not know about Ireland or where it was. I just wanted to leave Algeria. I did my military service and started work at the same time but also started looking for a visa. I tried France, Germany, Italy, Canada, US over 10 years and eventually got a visa to the UK. I didn\u2019t tell my mum or my dad, just my brother I was going.\u201d After 11 days in London in a hostel, he was advised by someone he had met while looking for a house share that he would be better off applying for asylum in Ireland and could go without papers via Belfast. \u201cI met someone who had been 10 years in London without papers, another 12 years, that\u2019s why I started thinking about Ireland,\u201d he says. Like Bar\u00e9, he has been unable to practise his profession because of different qualification standards, but he moved quickly to involve himself in local life, working in a charity shop to occupy himself six days a week, and he now works as a barista in nearby Gorey. \u201cThings were bad in Algeria,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel good and I just needed to leave. I didn\u2019t mind where. I was happy when I got England because it is famous. One of my friends say if England is not good there is a chance to go to Ireland. I had never heard this information before.\u201d Emmanuel (not quoted) in his room in the hotel in Courtown A bouncy, chirpy character, Mohamed says he may be sad inside over the traumas at home but outside he is \u201calways happy\u201d. He is currently waiting for his second interview in relation to his asylum application and says he is an optimist. Fluent in Arabic and French and improving his English, he wants to take exams to work as a vet again and build a future. Also in the hotel is Theron, a young South African journalism graduate who came to Ireland to escape persecution, including after attending a pride march with a friend in the township of Alexandra. He says he received death threats and was mugged multiple times, and felt unsafe in a country known to have an inadequate police force and whose murder rates are at a 20-year high. Theron in his bedroom at the hotel Theron\u2019s mother now lives in the UK with a sibling but he was not eligible to join them as he was no longer a minor. Not knowing what else to do, he sought refuge in Ireland in the hope he could be near his family. Courtown is \u201cvery peaceful\u201d, he says. \u201cPeople take care of each other. There are always activities and people ask us to help and they provide us with a few interesting things to do.\u201d He adds: \u201cI\u2019ve never felt threatened or hated. I\u2019ve haven\u2019t been called any names,\u201d though he says some of his friends closer to Dublin had to \u201ccancel some of their plans\u201d around the time of the anti-immigration riots in November last year. Theron in his room Why has Courtown been so successful in integrating asylum seekers and how did it escape the kind of anger and abuse captured in a recent RT\u00c9 documentary, Inside the Protests. People in the town say it is largely down to the integrated support offered by residents, the gardai, transport operators, the library, the football club. \u201cLooking at that programme, I can\u2019t get over what I was seeing. It was shocking, it was frightening,\u201d Carmel, a local shopkeeper, says of the documentary. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had problems with people here. They are nice, friendly, always say good morning and thank you, a lot of them can work, they are working, buying Irish cars, and putting money into the local economy.\u201d Donny, who works in a local store Donny, who works in the same store, says of the arrivals: \u201cPersonally I think it is good. We learn something from them. Some people feel they are losing the Irish heritage because they can\u2019t sing the national anthem. But you got to remember this country has been very stuck in its ways \u2013 look at the priests and the abuse that only came out. We\u2019ve got to remember our way isn\u2019t always the best way.\u201d Craig Lang, the chair of the local River Chapel community complex Craig Lang, a community activist says the key to the success was that Courtown residents decided to get to know the people in the hotel. The gardai were responsive to any issues in the hotel, and some of the arrivals were welcomed into the football team, given work in the local Tesco and bakery and asked to steward local festivals. Their visibility reduced the chances of fear taking hold in this small seaside resort. The community already had experience with families in the hotel, so Lang says there was \u201ccrossover\u201d when the hotel became a centre for male asylum seekers. \u201cIt was simple really.

What are his tips for other towns? \u201cSpeak to the people, engage with them, get to know them,\u201d he says. \u201cGet to know their story.

Here are today\u2019s major developments: Police have labelled a shooting on the Mornington Peninsula that left two people dead a \u201ctargeted\u201d attack, as the suspect remains at large. One of the two deceased has been identified as a 29-year-old man who lived at the Rye property. More than a dozen people have been charged over an alleged multimillion-dollar attempted import of cocaine into Australia, the largest in the nation\u2019s history. The federal government will establish an independent inquiry into sexual violence in the Australian military and ensure serving personnel convicted of sex offences in either criminal or military courts face mandatory discharge, under its formal response to the defence and veterans\u2019 suicide royal commission. A man in his 60s was bitten by a shark while spear fishing off Curtis Island this morning. And Penrith Beach, affectionately known by Sydneysiders as \u201cPondi\u201d \u2013 will reopen on 7 December for a second season. Federal court hears allegations against Health Workers Union leader Health Workers Union leader Diana Asmar allegedly claimed so-called \u201ctraitors\u201d would regret betraying her, a couple of weeks before five staffers and two officials were stood down. Lawyers for the national union (HSU) made the allegations in the federal court on Monday as they sought more restrictions on Asmar\u2019s role in its Victorian branch. The interlocutory application is part of a broader push by the HSU to have administrators appointed to the state branch, called the Health Workers Union. Justice Craig Dowling made orders on 7 October limiting Asmar\u2019s powers, including preventing her from dismissing any employees or altering their employment. Asmar made an undertaking to the court that she would follow the judge\u2019s orders. But HSU barrister Malcolm Harding SC told the court Asmar made a speech at a delegates conference on 23 October, saying there were traitors in the union who would regret betraying her. Two union officials from the Victorian branch were then stood down and five call centre workers dismissed on 11 November. Harding claimed under union rules, Asmar was the only one with the power to terminate someone\u2019s employment. He claimed Asmar had breached her undertaking and the judge should make further orders restricting her. But Asmar\u2019s barrister Rishi Nathwani KC argued there should not be any changes because his client has not breached any of her court undertakings. Justice Dowling will make a decision on whether to impose further restrictions at a later date. -AAP. Queensland bill \u2018major step in the wrong direction\u2019 says human rights boss Scott McDougall, the state\u2019s human rights commissioner said: We\u2019ve now reached the point where the attorney general accepts that this bill is not only more punitive than necessary, will disproportionately affect First Nations children and create a system which better protects adults from arbitrary detention than children, but also will likely result in children being subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. We are forging ahead knowingly violating the UN Convention Against Torture against children in any other context that is called child abuse. Is this really what the public wants? The Justice, Integrity and Safety Committee will sit a second and last time tomorrow in Townsville. It will then finalise a report with recommendations about the bill, which will be completed on Friday. The legislation will return to the floor of parliament for a final vote next week. Queensland parliament told \u2018detention centres are overflowing\u2019 Meanwhile, a series of community and human rights groups have appeared at a parliamentary inquiry into the new legislation. The committee will hold just two days of hearings into the laws, before releasing a report on Friday. The Youth Advocacy Centre\u2019s Katherine Hayes estimated about 2,000 children had been sentenced for crimes captured by the legislation in the past 12 months, who would be given longer sentences. There\u2019s nowhere to put those 2,000 kids. The detention centres are overflowing. The watch houses are disgraceful. Attorney general Deb Frecklington acknowledged Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children would be disproportionately affected by the legislation, but denied it was racist. She acknowledged to the inquiry it discriminated on the basis of age. We think that this legislation breaches the federal Racial Discrimination Act, and because of section 109 of the constitution, is going to be void, I think the government needs to look into that before passing it. UN calls on Queensland to ditch new youth crime laws The head of the United Nations committee on the rights of the child has called on Queensland to abandon its signature \u2018Adult time, adult crime\u2019 laws. The state\u2019s attorney general, Deb Frecklington, concedes the Making Queensland Safer bill contradicts state and international human rights law and is discriminatory against children. The legislation drastically increases maximum sentences for children as young as 10 convicted of a schedule of offences, including a mandatory life sentence for murderers. Ann Skelton, chairperson of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, used social media to call the attorney\u2019s concession \u201cextraordinary\u201d. \u201cWe do not agree that the so called exceptional circumstances warrant what will be a flagrant disregard for children\u2019s rights under international law,\u201d she said, on X. We also don\u2019t agree that it will make Queensland safer. We urge the government of Queensland to stand firm with the principle that children should be treated differently from adults in the criminal justice system. NSW Essential Energy workers to go on strike Rural residents are warned they may be left without power as electricity workers walk off the job in a lengthy dispute over pay and conditions. More than 2,000 Essential Energy workers begin a series of rolling 72-hour work stoppages from Tuesday, saying pay negotiations have stalled. The NSW government-owned company operates one of Australia\u2019s largest electricity networks, covering rural and remote parts of the state and southern Queensland. Electrical Trades Union secretary Allen Hicks said NSW energy minister Penny Sharpe on Monday indicated the government would not move on five key issues. The NSW government has made it very clear that we\u2019re in for a tough summer when it comes to strain on our electricity grid and the workers who manage it \u2013 the government needs to make sure we\u2019re equipped to deal with what is ahead. The network services 890,000 homes and businesses across 95% of NSW. Essential Energy said it had worked constructively to progress an enterprise agreement, including through 19 bargaining meetings since May. But the union has not shifted its position nor made counter offers to come to an agreement, the company said in a statement. -AAP. Negotiations continue between Woolworths and the United Workers Union The two parties sat down today to negotiate over worker demands for better pay and conditions, but no agreement was reached. Warehouse workers have been on strike for almost two weeks. Four Woolworths distribution centres in New South Wales and Victoria have been on indefinite strike since 21 November, leading to shortages in some stores in Victoria, NSW and the ACT. On Sunday, Woolworths said it would reopen its primary connect Melbourne south regional distribution centre today, but the attempt failed after workers and supporters picketed the site and blocked entrances. We know that there have been shortages on our shelves in some Woolworths stores and that this is really frustrating for our customers. We\u2019ve been working tirelessly to reopen our Melbourne south regional distribution centre so we can improve the amount of essential grocery items on our shelves for our Victorian customers. The United Workers Union (UWU) is calling for a pay increase to at least $38 an hour for warehouse staff, as well as consistent wages and conditions across distribution centres. It also wants a productivity framework that pushed workers to achieve an 100% efficiency rate to be scrapped for good. United Workers Union National Secretary, Tim Kennedy, said in a statement Monday afternoon that Woolworths showed signs of recognising how important the issue of the framework was to workers. We have seen Woolworths threaten escalating industrial conflict and the importation of aggressive US-style industrial relations tactics is regrettable. But today\u2019s negotiations show Woolworths the way they should be resolving this issue \u2013 by talking with and listening to their workers. We are hopeful of a breakthrough because our workers deserve to be safe at work. Barnaby Joyce, the shadow veterans\u2019 affairs minister, followed Keogh He said the royal commission was \u201cvery thorough\u201d and had come to the \u201cbest spot we would expect\u201d. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s perfect, nothing is perfect and no one in that field wants to hear you say this is a grand panacea that will fix all problems. It will assist and we still have a lot of work to do. Amongst that lot of work to do is to pass legislation. If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m frustrated about, it is we were promised this would be through by the end of the year and it is not true. We managed to get through a bill apparently about not selling NBN, which we were never intending to do. Politics started playing its part and took the place of pieces of legislation, this being amongst the most vital. Asked why the Veterans\u2019 Affairs bill didn\u2019t progress last week, Joyce replied \u201cbecause they were too busy doing other things\u201d. Legislation was flying around the chamber like a mad hamburger being made. The thing that was vital was this, we were promised that the legislation that is currently in the house and the Senate would be passed by the end of parliament. It wasn\u2019t and therefore the question has to go to Mr Albanese, why? Veterans affairs minister commits to royal commission recommendations Matt Keogh appeared on ABC Afternoon Briefing earlier, after the acceptance of 104 of 122 recommendations from the royal commission into defence and veterans\u2019 suicide, including establishing a new commission to provide independent advice on suicide prevention. Keogh said one of the roles of the commission was \u201cmaking sure we don\u2019t see what has happened in the past\u201d \u2013 where reviews with many recommendations weren\u2019t implemented by the government. It will have a role in that. It will also have a role in looking at research. We need someone independent and separate from defence and the DVA that has an understanding of the impacts of service life on our serving members, veterans and their families and is able to work with and understand the research requirements and how to conduct proper inquiries, working with the public service to break through some of the roadblocks that have been there in the past. He said following through on the recommendations was \u201cabout making sure we are looking after our people who are serving and our veterans and their families\u201d. The focus of what we\u2019re doing here though is recognising the important work that has to happen to support our serving personnel veterans. Correction to report of Bruce Chapman\u2019s Nation Press Club address Returning briefly to economist Bruce Chapman\u2019s National Press Club address, and we have a correction to issue from his speech. Chapman took issue with calls for free higher education and the cancellation of unpaid student debt as advocated by the Greens. He was not taking issue with cancelling 20% of student debt, as Labor has announced if it is elected next year. The cost of abolishing all student debt is estimated at $80bn. Chapman compared this with increasing jobseeker payments by $2,000 per annum for 80 years or a year of the total cost of running all hospitals. What does this mean? For economists there is no such thing as free higher education \u2013 or indeed, free anything \u2026 there are trade-offs to be made with all policy decisions. Chapman said 65% of Australian adults were not university graduates, and earned less over their lifetime than university graduates. The equity issue is this \u2026 free to students and graduates means greater tax payments from, or, less services to the disadvantaged. The chief executive of the Victorian gambling regulator has resigned with two years left to serve on her term. Annette Kimmitt was appointed to the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission in March 2022 and will leave the regulator in late March next year. An email announcing Kimmitt\u2019s departure to staff by the commission\u2019s chair, Fran Thorn, who is also departing the organisation, said she had transformed the regulator\u2019s approach to the gambling industry after the Crown Royal Commission. Kimmitt told Guardian Australia her decision to resign was influenced by \u201cthe pull of family\u201d. I have got my first grand-daughter due in January, my mother is ageing and needs a bit more help. It is just that time of life where I\u2019m deciding to step away from full-time executive work. Kimmitt admitted it had been \u201ca very challenging and difficult three years\u201d and that she had joined a \u201cpretty shell-shocked and under-resourced regulator on the retreat\u201d. I am really proud of what the organisation has done in three short years. We are now recognised as the nation\u2019s strongest gambling regulator. We have really held the industry to account. Since January 2022, we have levied nearly $260m in fines. We had 88 disciplinary actions against the industry just last year. Man killed in NSW truck accident A man has died after a truck went through a guardrail and down an embankment on the Princes Highway in the Illawarra. At about 10.50am, emergency services were called to the highway at Bulli after reports a truck travelling southbound went through the guardrail and down an embankment. NSW Ambulance paramedics attended, however the man, who is yet to be formally identified, died at the scene. The Princes Highway is closed in both directions between the M1 Princes Motorway and Lawrence Hargrave Drive. Josh Frydenberg announced as co-patron of political leadership prize The McKinnon Foundation has appointed former Liberal treasurer Josh Frydenberg as co-patron of its annual prize for political leadership, alongside former Labor prime minister Julia Gillard. The former Morrison government minister and deputy Liberal leader joins the first female prime minister in overseeing the awarding of the annual McKinnon prize, with selection panels for the 2024 prize to be announced on Tuesday ahead of the prize being awarded early next year. Frydenberg said the prize recognised and encouraged leaders who apply \u201cintegrity and intellect, courage and conviction\u201d to addressing the nation\u2019s challenges. In today\u2019s uncertain world we need leaders with these qualities more than ever, as we strive to create a better future for all Australians.\u201d Announced in March this year, the 2023 was awarded jointly to ACT independent senator David Pocock and Tasmanian Liberal backbench MP Bridget Archer. Peak university body urges action as review begins into research and development Universities Australia has welcomed the announcement of a review into Australia\u2019s research and development (R&amp;D) system while cautioning Labor it doesn\u2019t need to wait for recommendations to take immediate action. Its CEO, Luke Sheehy, said including increasing stipends for PhD candidates, who were integral to the research and innovation landscape, and extending the length of research grants would immediately provide financial certainty for researchers. R&amp;D is the engine room of Australia\u2019s future \u2013 it drives productivity, economic growth and progress. But we can\u2019t afford to kick the can down the road. We don\u2019t need a review to tell us what we already know \u2013 Australia needs greater, more sustainable funding for R&amp;D now. Sheehy said Australia was \u201cfalling behind\u201d, with R&amp;D investment at just 1.68% of GDP, compared with the OECD average of 2.73%. The government can score a few quick wins now by adopting some of the recommendations in the Universities Accord final report, including increasing PhD stipends and extending the duration of research grants to provide researchers with greater job security.p Police \u2018very concerned\u2019 firearm is still out in the community Victoria police are placing \u201ca lot of urgency\u201d on apprehending the male: It is absolutely concerning for us and we are throwing all the resources added at this present time. Any information [will] make that arrest happen a lot quicker and we will be much more confident if that is the case. Asked why the man and woman attended the address, police said this was still under investigation \u2013 however they were alerted to the property by a 000 call. The two people, now deceased, were found within the house. We don\u2019t know what the dispute was about \u2026 we do not know who the man is at the stage and we are yet to identify them. We are piecing that together today. Police \u201cassume\u201d a getaway car was used but do not have further details or a description, nor do they know where the gun was sourced. Asked if drugs were involved, police confirmed \u201cthat is part of our inquiry\u201d. The 29-year-old deceased male was known to police. We don\u2019t know the identities of those two people that came into the house. Certainly we will let you know as soon we do. Police say a man and a woman, yet to be identified, visited an address in Rye on the Mornington Peninsula where there was \u201csome sort of altercation\u201d. Shots were fired, and the woman and a 29-year-old man who lived at the property were fatally injured. The visiting male fled the scene and was still at large. It appears that a firearm or firearms have been discharged and a man who lived at that property and the woman that attended that property were seriously injured. The man who attended the property in company with this woman left before police attended. Obviously we are seeking to find out the identity of that man and locate him although I cannot go into specifics, we are actively looking for that man and we are appealing for anyone that may have been in that area at four o\u2019clock this morning that may have seen something. I understand how distressing this is but we believe that they were known to each other, all of the parties and that it was targeted. I understand this will cause fear in the community but we are actively investigating at this time and I think we will have some good avenues to follow. NSW sets minimum pay for musicians at events that receive state funding New South Wales has become the sixth state or territory to introduce minimum pay for musicians performing at any event that receives state funding, including music festivals and sporting events. The $250 minimum fee per artist deal brings NSW in line with Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, Western Australia and the ACT that all now operate under similar schemes introduced since Covid-19 cut a swathe through the live music industry. According to the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA) half of Australia\u2019s working musicians earned less than $6,000 last year, placing the sector in an insecure work crisis. A survey conducted by Musicians Australia earlier this year found that 60% of working musicians were paid less than $250 a gig, despite more than one-third of them having spent up to 20 hours a week rehearsing, practising or preparing for a gig. The $250 pay per gig minimum is part of the NSW government\u2019s new 10-year contemporary music strategy. In case you missed it earlier, here\u2019s a video detailing the Queensland police\u2019s announced largest-ever alleged seizure of cocaine. And that\u2019s where I\u2019ll leave you for today. Caitlin Cassidy will steer the blog from here. A man in his 60s was bitten by a shark while spear fishing off Curtis Island this morning. The Queensland ambulance service said the man was stable but had lacerations and abrasions to both his arms. The attack occurred at about 8.25am. The man was transported to Gladstone hospital by police boat. Jobseekers protest outside job provider rated worst by members The Australian Unemployed Workers\u2019 Union has staged a protest at APM Employment Services in Brunswick after the organisation suspended thousands of jobseekers each week and was rated the worst provider by members. Jobseekers in Melbourne were rallying outside the inner north office, with several handing over the \u201cgolden demerit\u201d award in a ceremony. The AUWU\u2019s Victorian coordinator, Jessica Harrison, said the high rates of suspension, as previously reported in Guardian Australia, had resulted in unnecessary stress for jobseekers: In a three-month period, APM suspended payments of 32,220 claimants. That\u2019s over 2,600 per work. This is outrageous. It\u2019s stressful enough to try to make ends meet in the current economic climate, without having your lifeline cut. And the privatised job agencies receive government handouts for this. One of the protesters carried a sign that said \u201cshow us your payslips\u201d in reference to concerns the provider threatened to hand over payslip details, which would trigger a publicly funded payment. APM has previously denied any wrongdoing. AUWU said this year it had received more complaints about APM than any other provider, with jobseekers rating the agency 1.93/5 in a recent national survey. Forrest\u2019s lawyer welcomes Meta move on advertiser verification The senior legal counsel for billionaire mining magnate and philanthropist Andrew Forrest, Simon Clarke, has welcomed Meta\u2019s announcement that the company will require businesses and individuals to verify themselves before being able to put financial ads on Facebook or Instagram. Guardian Australia revealed this morning that Meta would begin verifying ads in February in a bid to stop fake celebrity crypto investment scam ads on the platforms. Forrest\u2019s likeness has been used in many of the ads, and he has taken Meta to court in the US over the scam ads. Clarke told ABC Perth on Monday that the announcement was \u201cwelcome and significant\u201d. He added: We think it\u2019s something that Dr Forrest has been advocating for for some time, and we think it will make a material difference to the amount of fraud on the platform, it\u2019s essentially a compliance procedure that should work at the front end to stop a lot of the criminals getting on the platform. He said he would like to see Meta allow elderly or vulnerable people to have to opt in to seeing financial ads in the first place. Forrest\u2019s case against Meta in the US is still in the discovery process, Clarke said, which he said would give insight into how the decisions are made and to what extent there is automation. Clarke said since the case was launched, the number of fraudulent ads featuring Forrest had started to diminish, but between April and December last year, there were seven new scam ads a day, or about 1,700 in total. More than a dozen people have been charged over an alleged multimillion-dollar attempted import of cocaine into Australia, the largest in the nation\u2019s history. Australian federal police charged 11 men and two juveniles with conspiring to import 2.34 tonnes of cocaine into the country by sea. It is alleged the men and crew of a vessel attempted to import the drugs into Queensland with multiple groups planning to collect the cocaine onshore. The men were arrested on Saturday after a collaborative effort by the AFP and Queensland police investigating a transnational organised crime syndicate. The amount of cocaine allegedly attempted to be imported weighs the same as a Ford Raptor ute. The AFP said it is estimated to have a street value of $760m and could equate to 11.7 million street deals. More on this story here: NSW foster care system not fit for purpose, government report says The NSW foster care system is not fit for purpose, a Minns government report has found, and is characterised by \u201ca profound lack of accountability and ineffective oversight\u201d. The report, which was commissioned by the state\u2019s minister for families and communities, Kate Washington, found the $2bn out-of-home care system was \u201coverly complex, fragmented, and slow to respond in the best interests of children and young people\u201d. It also found the system was \u201clargely devoid\u201d of robust evidence-based practices. It comes after a damning audit into the child protection system by the state\u2019s auditor general, Bola Oyetunji, found the state was failing tens of thousands of vulnerable children due to the \u201cineffective\u201d system. The government\u2019s report has 13 recommendations to fix the system, including ensuring foster care placements are evidence-informed and reduce the reliance on High-Cost Emergency Arrangements. Washington said: It\u2019s shocking that some out-of-home care providers are failing to provide basic supports to children, despite being paid hundreds of thousands, and in some cases, millions, of taxpayer dollars to do so. Over the past 18 months, the Minns Labor Government has been stabilising the system, now we will begin rebuilding the foundations so that we can invest in better outcomes. Hecs architect favours levy on universities over \u2018very blunt\u2019 international student cap The Hecs/Help architect, economist Bruce Chapman, has called the proposed international student cap a \u201cvery blunt instrument\u201d but made the case for a levy on universities. Taking questions at the National Press Club, Chapman said he wasn\u2019t an immigration expert but there was a \u201cbetter way of doing things\u201d than a hard cap, adding: Economists hate quantity restrictions. Chapman instead made the economic case for a levy on universities, pointing to large public sector subsidies that universities had benefited from historically: Australian universities, some for well over 100 years, have been hugely subsidised in terms of research money which has built up their reputations \u2026 and on top of that, they\u2019re rent-free. [Their] properties are getting huge public sector subsidies \u2026 the case for a levy is in part about getting a return for taxpayers. Woolies warehouse remains closed after staff picket site Hundreds of supermarket workers fighting for better pay and conditions have picketed a Woolworths warehouse that was due to reopen today after employees began rolling strikes. The United Workers Union picketed the distribution centre Melbourne\u2019s Dandenong South on Monday, one of several distribution centres across eastern Australia subject to industrial action since 21 November. Union delegates at the scene told AAP the workers were protesting against unrealistic performance expectations, which they claim had led to frequent injuries. The supermarket giant allocates workers a certain time for a task, then ranks their performance out of 100, something they say puts undue pressure on them and has a negative impact on wellbeing. They are also demanding better wages and an agreement that workers at different sites are paid the same amount. The disruption has caused some product shelves in supermarkets across Melbourne to be left bare. One union delegate said workers would continue their around-the-clock protest for as long as it took to reach a resolution. Here\u2019s more from my colleague Ariel Bogle on the impact Woolworths\u2019 efficiency measures are having on workers: The architect of student loans, economist Bruce Chapman, is appearing today at the National Press Club (NPC) on the topic \u201cHecs isn\u2019t broken, but it needs urgent attention\u201d. He has called the federal government\u2019s recent changes to raise the minimum repayment threshold and make repayment scales fairer the best changes to the Hecs/Help system in three decades. But he was less supportive of calls from the Greens to make tertiary education free and cancel all student debt \u2013 pointing out the estimated $80bn budget cost could be better used to run the public hospital system for a year or increase the jobseeker payment. Chapman has also been scathing of the former Morrison government\u2019s Job Ready Graduates Scheme, which vastly increased the cost of some degrees, including humanities. Labor has canned the scheme, but is delaying any reform to the cost of degrees to a yet-to-be-established independent commission. \u2022 This post was amended on 2 December 2024. An earlier version incorrectly said Chapman had criticised Labor\u2019s pledge to wipe debts by 20%, rather than the Greens\u2019 proposal to wipe all student debt. Shorten hails changes to Centrepay, which was not \u2018working as intended\u2019 Continuing with Bill Shorten\u2019s earlier press conference at Parliament House, the government services minister says he\u2019s \u201cvery confident\u201d reforms to bar predatory providers from financially abusing welfare recipients will continue after he\u2019s moved on from federal politics. As Guardian Australia reported this morning, the government will boot \u201chigh-risk services\u201d from the Centrepay system, which includes companies providing consumer leases and household goods. The Centrepay system allows government-approved providers of essential services, such as rent and electricity, to take money from a person\u2019s welfare payment before it is deposited in their bank account but the types of services available have broadened in recent years. Shorten said on Monday the system had been \u201cmisfiring\u201d nor \u201cworking as intended\u201d. When it does work, it\u2019s very good, but the government was seeing a whole lot of problems, where, in particular, some services that were being provided for Centrepay were really not appropriate for the vulnerable people on the government systems. About 10,000 businesses offer services to the more than 607,000 users who opt-in to the Centrepay system, Shorten said. Most did the \u201cright thing\u201d, he said, while others were \u201cvery inappropriate\u201d and were taking advantage. The announcement is complicated by Shorten\u2019s departure from parliament next month, when the former opposition leader will take up the role of president and vice-chancellor at the University of Canberra. But he insisted he was \u201cvery confident\u201d the reform would continue after he had left. Shorten said he believed this for three reasons: an improvement in culture, advocates pushing strongly and the Albanese government recognising not to treat \u201cpeople as the enemy\u201d or view them \u201cunder suspicion\u201d. This has been a very good process, and I think it sets a pattern for how to do consultation in the future. Shorten says NDIS is in good shape for next minister The outgoing NDIS minister, Bill Shorten, believes the $42bn program is in a good place for the next minister as he embarks on a career move out of federal politics. Shorten outlined a number of the changes made since the release of the NDIS review almost a year ago, conceding \u201cthere are still lots of things to improve, but it\u2019s definitely headed in the right direction\u201d. The former Labor leader was asked a number of questions about who he thought should take on the NDIS and government services portfolios after he leaves for the University of Canberra in January. Shorten said: I think [the NDIS is] a portfolio which requires passion. It requires a commitment to people with disability. It requires a lot of thought, and it requires a lot of effort, and there are many Labor parliamentarians who pass that prescription. But as for any particular names, Shorten was tight-lipped. I think the NDIS is a very important portfolio. How the prime minister chooses to construct his cabinet will be up to him \u2026 there\u2019s 680,000 people directly benefiting from it so it certainly does require that cabinet level of attention but the machinery of government matters, it\u2019s not on my job description \u2026 The ANZ and Indeed, meanwhile, this morning released their survey of job ads for November. While there was a 1.3% fall for the month, the previous numbers were upwardly revised to a 0.7% month-on-month increase. Yes, ads are down 27.6% from the peak reached in June 2022, but the tally remains 15.1% above pre-pandemic levels. Stability in the labour market is good for those in work (or looking for it) if not for the chances of an early Reserve Bank interest rate cut. Prior to today, the market was tipping just a 3% (ie negligible) chance of a cut in the cash rate at the RBA\u2019s final board meeting for 2024 on 9-10 December. Finally, there was some mildly positive news on the building approvals front in October. There were 15,498 dwellings approved, seasonally adjusted, in the month, the most since December 2022. The 4.2% increase for the month was better than the 1.3% increase economists had expected. From a year ago, the approvals were up 6.1%. If maintained for a year, the October approvals would deliver a bit over 180,000 new dwellings (assuming each approval led to a completed dwelling). A bit of an improvement but still only three-quarters of the pace the federal government wants if we are to get 1.2m new homes over five years. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has released a slew of September quarter and October numbers today, most of which point to the economy holding up if not gathering a bit of pace. Retail sales in October expanded 0.6% for the month, better than the 0.4% pace expected by economists. The annual clip, at 3.4%, was the best since May 2023, and well ahead of the 2.1% headline inflation rate. It\u2019s always a bit tricky to compare spending with earlier years because \u201cBlack Friday\u201d spending \u2013 and all the pre-BF events \u2013 may be pulling forward some of the spending. Still, the revised stage-three tax cuts left more money in a lot of pockets/digital wallets. And there are other numbers suggesting resilience in the economy if not a gathering of growth momentum. Data for the September quarter showed wages advanced 1.2% in those three months to be 4% higher than a year earlier. Profits didn\u2019t go so well, down 8.5%, but lower commodity prices probably played a bit of a role there. \u2018Deeply disappointing\u2019: Victorian gambling regulator criticises federal government delay on ad ban The chair of the Victorian gambling regulator has criticised the federal government\u2019s delayed action on wagering ads, describing it as \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d. Fran Thorn is the outgoing chair of the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission who will leave the role on 31 December. She told Guardian Australia the federal government could have at least restricted ads, if not banned them: As the outgoing chair of the VGCCC, it is deeply disappointing that the federal government has not been able to find the time to pass legislation to ban gambling advertising, even in part. This would have represented an important step forward for gambling regulation and harm minimisation. The commission has previously called for the federal government to implement the recommendations of a parliamentary inquiry into gambling harm, including a full ban on wagering ads after a three-year transition period. Its leaders have reported a \u201cbombardment\u201d of concern from parents about gambling ads. Last week, the communications minister\u2019s office apologised to multiple people harmed by the gambling industry after delaying the long-awaited advertising reforms, admitting government action has taken \u201clonger than hoped\u201d. Continuing on from our last post: As the Aemo executive Michael Gatt says, \u201cfor several years, Aemo has flagged these emerging risks and with the support of state governments and network operators are developing appropriate emergency solutions\u201d. \u201cAemo does not want to directly control people\u2019s rooftop solar,\u201d Gatt said. That said, if actions to secure the grid aren\u2019t enough, \u201cthe temporary management of rooftop solar by network operators under state government solar management programs may still be required although we expect this may only occur in very rare circumstances\u201d. As independent energy analysts such as Gabrielle Kuiper have noted elsewhere, Aemo could do more to explain and demonstrate the grid has a problem. If they did, it might be clear that alternatives exist before \u201clast-resort measures\u201d are taken to turn off rooftop solar. Why not, say, set up a contracting market much like Aemo has when demand is forecast to be too strong, and big users get rewarded by powering down. These users might be encouraged to power up during low-demand periods. Aemo might also give incentives so we get more virtual power plants that connect up batteries (including those in households), Kuiper said. The Smart Energy Council, too, said its calls for a Battery Booster program would help resolve the issue and help accommodate a lot more households joining the 4m already with solar panels. The council has been advocating \u201cfor a consistent national approach that doesn\u2019t place the burden on equipment manufacturers, installers and the rest of the industry\u201d, its chief executive, John Grimes, said. And as we noted a few weeks back, using \u201covervoltage\u201d as the way to turn off solar inverters to stop rooftops\u2019 exports is not without its problems: \u2018Emergency backstop\u2019 tool needed to curb rooftop solar if grid demand too low: Aemo Last week, we had the prospect of too much demand for the power grid in NSW, and the prospect of repeats during summer (as we noted in this analysis from yesterday). Well, there are challenges for the electricity market at the other end of the range. On sunny days in spring and autumn (when it\u2019s not too hot or cold), there is so much solar energy being generated that so-called minimum system loads may not be sufficient for the grid to be secure. We looked at this issue a couple of months ago when MSL alerts were being issued for Victoria: As it happens, the Australian Energy Market Operator has released a report this morning that highlights the progress (or lack of it) in dealing with those times when rooftop solar panels are exporting a lot \u2013 perhaps too much \u2013 electricity into the grid. \u201cNow that rooftop [photovoltaics] is supplying more than half the grid at times, this requires introduction of a new \u2018emergency backstop\u2019 mechanism,\u201d Aemo\u2019s report states. This mechanism would \u201callow rooftop PV systems to be curtailed or turned off briefly if necessary in rare emergency conditions, similar to the capabilities normally required of any large scale generator\u201d. Now, Aemo is not saying they should be given that mechanism. Rather, the point is that various states have taken some steps to work with the distribution networks, but progress is not uniform and also not moving fast enough. Here\u2019s how things stand: PM says service differential allowing veterans injured in \u2018operational type service\u2019 to be compensated more will remain The only recommendation the government did not support by the defence and veterans\u2019 suicide royal commission was the suggestion to remove the service differential for permanent impairment compensation. Albanese said this wasn\u2019t accepted because it allows for higher levels of compensation for those who are injured in \u201coperational type service\u201d. The service differential is a longstanding feature of Australia\u2019s support for veterans, it\u2019s been there a long time. While all veterans can access support for all conditions linked to their service through the Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs, the service differential supports higher levels of compensation for illness or injury that occurs in operational type service. We regard \u2026 that feature as being important. And that is why we have made the decision to maintain it. Albanese wrapped up the press conference by drawing attention to the suicide figures among Australia\u2019s veterans: Between 1997 and 2021, there were 1,677 confirmed suicides by either serving personnel or ex-serving members. That\u2019s 1,677 lives too many. Every single one of them is heartbreaking and I want to acknowledge, conclude by acknowledging, that today will be triggering for many families as well. It will be a really difficult day, even though this is, I think, a very strong response for the government. Veterans affairs minister says wellbeing strategy and 90-day turnaround for compensation claims to be announced The veterans affairs minister, Matt Keogh, said the government would also be shortly releasing a wellbeing strategy and another to support military personnel as they transition to civilian life. Keogh listed a number of other improvements, including compensation claims processed in less than 90 days. Keogh said: That is a huge body of work but it\u2019s a huge body of work that happened because of the passionate advocacy of the family members of those who had taken their own life. It\u2019s for these families, for our serving personnel, for our veterans, that we have worked so quickly to produce this response to the royal commission because we deeply understand the urgency and importance of doing this work. Keogh was also asked why healthcare fee schedules are higher for NDIS over DVA clients. He said: This is an issue we need to address with the NDIS but also DVA, the Department of Health and in aged care. That\u2019s why government has done work around an independent pricing authority to guide government on pricing. What we\u2019ve said is instead of dealing with veterans affairs as a stand alone area, we want to make sure we\u2019re addressing the issues holistically across government. Marles says work of defence and veterans services commission will begin immediately The minister for defence, Richard Marles, has provided further details on the defence and veterans services commission which will be established following a recommendation by the defence and veterans\u2019 suicide royal commission. He said the work of the body would begin immediately rather than waiting until the body is legislated next year. Marles said: I thank Julie-Ann Finney, whose advocacy was at the heart of this royal commission occurring in the first place. But for her advocacy, this would not have happened. Her dedication, her persistence, has changed our country much for the better. I would like to, in acknowledging Julie-Ann, acknowledge all the families of those who have lost loved ones to suicide and who have served. I would like to thank all of those who gave evidence before the royal commission. It was critically important, but to do so was difficult and it was brave. New commission announced with goal of \u2018comprehensive reform\u2019 of defence culture Anthony Albanese has announced a new commission to undertake \u201ccomprehensive reform\u201d in the wake of the defence and veterans\u2019 suicide royal commission. The prime minister, speaking to media moments after the government released its response to the royal commission, said: My government will establish a new defence and veterans services commission, to undertake the most comprehensive reform to the culture, systems and processes across defence, the ADF, and the Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs to prevent suicide and improve the mental health and wellbeing of service personnel and veterans. The royal commission heard harrowing evidence about the cultural problems within the Australian Defence Force over time, and identified deficiencies with the approach, services and support of the Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs. Albanese said the government had accepted the majority of the recommendations, agreeing in principle to 104 recommendations, noting 17 recommendations for further consideration, and one recommendation is not supported in part. He said it was a government\u2019s \u201cfastest response ever\u201d to a royal commission. The federal government will establish an independent inquiry into sexual violence in the Australian military and ensure serving personnel convicted of sex offences in either criminal or military courts face mandatory discharge, under its formal response to the defence and veterans\u2019 suicide royal commission. Responding on Monday to the royal commission\u2019s final report produced earlier this year, the government has agreed that sex offences including stalking and abusively distributing intimate images should result in automatic discharge, subject to appeal. Personnel found to have engaged in sexual and related offences including harassment, unwanted touching and \u201cprejudicial\u201d or obscene conduct \u2013 whether through Defence\u2019s disciplinary or administrative processes \u2013 will need to demonstrate why they, too, should not be discharged. The measures are designed to be preventive and well as punitive, serving as a warning that any level of sexually inappropriate behaviour will have serious consequences. Those facing mandatory discharge would be able to challenge the ruling in a formal process triggered by the conviction. \u201cSexual misconduct and unacceptable behaviour have no place in Defence,\u201d the government\u2019s published response to the royal commission said. \u201cThe rates of sexual violence being reported in the ADF are completely unacceptable.\u201d The government has committed to establishing a new statutory body by September next year to oversee a system overhaul in Defence and Veterans\u2019 Affairs aimed at preventing suicide within the defence and veterans\u2019 community. That body will also provide evidence-based advice, with an interim head to be appointed \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Tesla chair dodges questions on Elon Musk as federal review of research and development announced Tesla chair Robyn Denholm has dodged questions on her close relationship with Elon Musk and whether she can help build a bridge between the federal government and the controversial figure. The government announced today a year-long review into research and development investment, which will be led by Denholm. Asked if she\u2019d spoken to Musk before taking the role, Denholm said: Today is about our R&amp;D future the country. Denholm, who was joined by the science minister, Ed Husic, told reporters a little earlier that she was honoured to chair the critical piece of work, saying it was vital to the future of the country: My objectives for this review is to unlock this immense potential of Australian research by turning it into tangible outcomes that deliver both economic and societal benefits. I am to shape R&amp;D settings that enhance our global competitiveness and secure our nation \u2018s future prosperity. Denholm will be assisted in the review by former chief scientist Ian Chubb, former Australian of the Year Fiona Wood, and Kate Cornick, the chief executive of the Victorian government\u2019s startup agency, LaunchVic. (We covered the details of the announcement earlier this morning here.) Flash flooding and rescues after major storms Australia\u2019s east coast has been battered by severe storms, causing flash flooding, swamping cars and forcing drivers to call for help, AAP reports. A brutal thunderstorm battered Brisbane on Sunday, turning roads into rivers and waterlogging cars. More than 50mm was recorded in 30 minutes in Brisbane City while surrounding suburbs bore the brunt with 70mm falling at Rosalie in an hour and 77mm at Holland Park West. Farther south, Upper Springbrook on the Gold Coast recorded more than 260mm of rain in the last 24 hours. Video footage showed water turning Brisbane\u2019s Roma Street into a river while southern suburbs like East Brisbane and Stones Corner became lakes due to flood waters. Advocates welcome Centrepay reform to protect vulnerable Australians Consumer advocates have welcomed the federal government\u2019s proposed reforms to the Centrepay payment system, saying they reverse years of inaction by successive governments. The government services minister, Bill Shorten, announced on Monday the government would overhaul the Centrepay system to better protect vulnerable Australians from predatory behaviour. Centrepay is a payment system designed to allow welfare recipients to manage their bills by allowing approved businesses to take money from their welfare payments, prior to it hitting their bank accounts. But the Guardian revealed this year how the system has been opened up to exploitation and error by lax oversight and a failure to crack down on dodgy operators. The government will now remove high-risk businesses from the system, including rent-to-buy household appliance operators, and will improve compliance and oversight of the system within Services Australia. Financial Rights Legal Centre senior policy officer Julia Davis said: We are reassured that these proposed reforms will proceed next year since some new and critical protections have already been put in place including mandatory end dates and deduction limits for clothing and household goods and a pause on onboarding new risky businesses. Consumer groups have been calling on successive governments to remove consumer lease companies and funeral expenses providers from Centrepay for over a decade. These announcements are a long time coming and have been the result of years of consistent advocacy. Eleven men and two juveniles have been charged by federal police after an investigation into the largest seizure of cocaine in Australia\u2019s history. The Australian federal police said it had made the charges on Monday, after the men were arrested late on Saturday and in the early hours of Sunday as part of a scheme to import 2.34 tonnes of cocaine into Australia by sea. Those arrested include the crew of a vessel allegedly attempting to import the illicit drugs into Queensland and multiple groups allegedly planning to collect the drugs onshore. The AFP has described the incident as relating to a transnational organised crime syndicate. Two people shot dead on Mornington Peninsula after reported altercation Two people have been shot dead, with police searching for the suspected gunman after reports of an early morning fight inside a suburban home. Homicide detectives are investigating after reports of an altercation between a group of people at a home in Rye, on Victoria\u2019s Mornington Peninsula, shortly after 4am on Monday. A man and woman were found with gunshot wounds, police say. \u201cDespite the best efforts of emergency services to revive the pair, they were declared deceased at the scene,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cIt\u2019s believed a second man fled the scene.\u201d Police believe all three people were known to each. AAP Penrith Beach, affectionately known by Sydneysiders as \u201cPondi\u201d \u2013 will reopen on 7 December for a second season. The swimming spot in western Sydney \u2013 where temperatures are routinely 10C hotter than the city\u2019s east \u2013 will operate from 10am to 7pm and will be open every day (including Christmas) until 27 April 2025. The NSW government said it has invested $2.5m to fund amenities and staffing for a second year. The deputy premier and minister for western Sydney, Prue Car, said: This is about equity. A place like Penrith Beach is critical for the people of Western Sydney. Hundreds of thousands of Western Sydney locals showed up and enjoyed Penrith Beach last year, and I cannot wait to join them for another summer season. If you want to learn more about Pondi, I suggest checking out my colleague Mostafa Rachwani\u2019s review: Man dies after balcony fall during police operation A man is dead after falling from a balcony during negotiations in a Queensland police operation. Queensland police said they were called to a Rockhampton home in central Queensland after reports of an unknown trespasser on Saturday night. When authorities arrived, police found a 37-year-old man standing on a second-floor balcony railing. Officers attempted to negotiate with the man but he fell from the balcony, suffering serious injuries. He died from his injuries after being taken to Rockhampton hospital. Police say the Ethical Standards Command is investigating the death and the state coroner has been advised. It will also be subject to independent oversight by the Crime and Corruption Commission. Craig Kelly joins Libertarian party for another run at parliament Craig Kelly is making another run for parliament \u2013 this time with the Libertarian party. The new political home for Kelly comes after he has tried out many others. In 2010, he was elected the Liberal MP for the electorate of Hughes. In 2021, he set up and served as leader of the United Australia Party. He ran as an independent for the 2023 NSW election and most recently was the campaign director for One Nation. Announcing his news to Ben Fordham on 2GB, Kelly said: I\u2019m proud to announce today that I\u2019m going to join the Libertarian party. I believe in small government. I believe in the entrepreneurial ability of Australians. Get government out of the way, get government out of their hands. That\u2019s what the Libertarian party stands for. Unfortunately, the Liberal party that I used to be a member of appears to have abandoned all those values. Asked what happened with this role with One Nation, Kelly said: I was there working on a contract basis for a small period of time. But look, I think the future in this country as a conservative party, to the right of the Liberal party, is with the libertarian. Water quality decreasing in largest river system Leading researchers say low-cost, simple changes could improve the declining health of Australia\u2019s long-mismanaged Murray-Darling Basin, AAP reports. As town tap water quality declines and the politics of water buybacks rage, a dozen environment and water experts on Monday released a damning assessment of the health of the basin that is home to 2.3 million Australians. The researchers found widespread failures to meet economic, environmental, social, Indigenous and compliance targets. The failures resulted in lower-than-expected river flows at 90% of sites measured, poor use of environmental flows and declining abundance of waterbirds. The researchers concluded that \u201cdespite $13 billion committed to water reforms, trends of most indicators (74 per cent) show no improvement or are worsening\u201d. Prof Bradley Moggridge, a Kamilaroi man, said on Monday: We found Indigenous-owned water entitlements to be grossly inadequate, furthering the disempowerment of Indigenous peoples in the management of water on country and contributing to negative effects on their health and wellbeing. The assessment comes after a 12-year, multi-government plan to restore sustainability in the complex river system failed, forcing its extension to December 2027. The researchers proposed several solutions including some form of rigorous, transparent, accountable system for monitoring, evaluating and reporting on the basin\u2019s health. Low-cost options included centralising data on threats to water quality, water law breaches, mass fish kills and town water security and supply. Reports of forced labour and exploitation up by 140% over last six years, AFP says Forced labour and exploitation reports have increased by 140% over the last six years, according to the Australian federal police, as criminal networks use deceptive tactics to traffic offshore workers to Australia. The AFP said since 2018 it has received 247 reports relating to forced labour and exploitation. The agency has raised the issue to mark International Day for the Abolition of Slavery today. In 2024, a Templestowe man was convicted on forced labour offences after he coerced someone to work 14-hour days for two consecutive years under threats of deportation. AFP\u2019s human exploitation commander, Helen Schneider, said: Criminal syndicates will use deceptive recruitment tactics to target and force vulnerable individuals into these appalling situations, and trap them into endless cycles of debt, forced labour or domestic servitude. The AFP is the lead agency in investigating this crime type and we investigate any reports we receive but we also urge members of the public to be vigilant and alert police to any suspicions of human trafficking offences. Israel-Gaza conflict will be a \u2018big issue\u2019 for some voters, Husic says Circling back to the science minister, Ed Husic, who was on RN Breakfast a short time ago. Asked if he expects Muslim voters in Australia to follow the trend in the US where backlash increased during the election in some states over the Israel-Gaza war, Husic said for \u201csome people\u201d in Australia this will be a \u201cbig issue\u201d when they go to the ballot box. There have been people for quite some time that have taken a particularly strong view about whether or not ourselves, or the rest of the world for that matter, have reacted as strongly as they could seeing the loss of so much innocent life in Gaza \u2026 and especially mothers and children, women and children who have been killed as a result of the actions by the Israeli government in Gaza, and then obviously the spread to Lebanon. There will be strong feelings about that. But again, to be able to just say definitively, this will definitely be the case, I think there\u2019s a mix of feelings out there talking with people, but you know, again, people, when they go to the ballot box, mix of different issues will be a play. This will, for some people, be a big issue. The Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young has said the Greens were \u201cdefinitively close\u201d to making a deal with Labor on environment laws, but it was clear the prime minister did not want those debated. Hanson-Young is speaking on RN Breakfast about the deal Anthony Albanese overruled after last-minute negotiations between the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, and the Greens. It involved a deal to pass Labor\u2019s key election promise to create two new agencies \u2013 an environmental protection agency to manage compliance with national laws and an information agency to manage environmental data. Hanson-Young said it \u201cremains the unfinished business of this parliament.\u201d She said: What I was told was that there was problems with the \u2026 set of amendments, or the areas that I have been negotiating [on] with Tanya Plibersek and that it was too hard to do this work. I walk out of the room, of course. And before we know, at the front page of the Australian, the West Australian, virtually every newspaper the next morning was saying that the business lobby, the miners and the loggers had convinced the prime minister to dump these laws. I want this on the national agenda when parliament returns. Nature\u2019s waited too long, and nature needs us. Albanese said on Sunday the government still planned to move forward with the changes but indicated it would not concede on Labor\u2019s \u201cvalues\u201d with crossbenchers. The science minister, Ed Husic, is speaking on RN Breakfast now about the year-long review of Australia\u2019s research and development investment. He is being questioned by Patricia Karvelas about the decision to appoint Tesla chair Robyn Denholm to lead the review. Asked if the link to Tesla and Elon Musk and his growing influence was part of the consideration, Husic said: No, I think, if I may emphasise, I guess, Robyn\u2019s involvement in a company that recognises, crucially, the value of R&amp;D and improving the way to get things done and to be able to create an edge, and particularly if you look at what Tesla has done, be able to turn an idea into reality at a time where there are a lot of doubters over a long period of time. The type of people that we\u2019ve got involved, we\u2019ve been thinking about for quite some time, and what they bring to the table. Husic said Australia\u2019s research and development performance has been dropping in the past ten years in comparison to \u201cour competitors in the OECD\u201d. Labor announces R&amp;D review in hopes of boosting Australian science and manufacturing A year-long review of Australia\u2019s research and development investment will soon be under way in an effort to boost the country\u2019s scientific output and manufacturing self-sufficiency. The science minister, Ed Husic, announced on Monday the review will inquire into the value of existing investments and ties between research and industry in order for Australia to boost its value and drive productivity. The investment into research and development as a proportion of GDP is at 1.68%, the government said, tailing behind the OECD average of 2.73%. In 2022-23, federal and state government expenditure stood at $4.3bn. The review will be led by Tesla chair Robyn Denholm, who will be joined by former chief scientist Ian Chubb, former Australian of the Year Fiona Wood, and Kate Cornick, the chief executive of the Victorian government\u2019s startup agency, LaunchVic. The report will be delivered by the end of 2025. Husic said: Our ideas and intellectual property are an indicator of future economic success. This review is designed to give us an evidence-based pathway to stronger growth. We said after the pandemic we would boost our manufacturing self-sufficiency. That is a big challenge, but Australian knowhow can help us do things smarter and sharpening our edge against international competition. Apple and Google app stores to be forced to play fair on search and payment Australians are set to get more choice and control over how they search for apps if new rules to slap big tech companies, such as Apple, Google and Facebook, with $50m fines for not playing fair are passed. The plans would give the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission more powers to prevent digital platforms from promoting their own apps over competitors, forcing users to pay for in-app purchases through their payment systems and stopping users from switching from a platform\u2019s app to an alternative. In a speech to be given on Monday night, the assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, will say: \u201cWe want to knock these practices on the head. And we want to lift transparency in a sector that has often been shrouded in secrecy so that consumers get a fair go. And that small businesses have a chance to deliver good products to the market.\u201d The plans will focus on app marketplaces and ad tech services and will allow the consumer watchdog to fine offending companies up to $50m or 30% of annual turnover. Jones will say: This framework will lead to more choice, lower prices and fairer outcomes for consumers. And it will level the playing field for small businesses and give them a chance to compete with good, innovative ideas. One of the biggest stoushes in recent years over the prace is between Fortnite developers Epic Games, and Google and Apple. The popular game developer is taking Apple and Google to court in Australia after Fortnite was removed from their app stores for introducing its own in-game payment system, which circumvented the marketplaces\u2019 fee system. Good morning, I\u2019ll be with you on the blog today. Australians are set to get more choice and control over how they search for apps if new rules to slap big tech companies, such as Apple, Google and Facebook, with $50m fines for not playing fair are passed. A year-long review of Australia\u2019s research and development investment will soon be under way in an effort to boost the country\u2019s scientific output and manufacturing self-sufficiency.

In its former incarnation as Jabhat al-Nusra or the Al-Nusra front, HTS later declared allegiance to al-Qaida. It publicly broke those ties in 2016 and rebranded as Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham \u2013 or \u201cOrganisation for the Liberation of the Levant\u201d. HTS is designated a terrorist group by the US, but it has abandoned its goal of establishing an Islamic state in Syria and is viewed as a less extreme organisation than Islamic State.</p> <p>HTS has become the most powerful rebel faction in Syria and controls Idlib, where about 4 million people live, with command of an estimated 30,000 troops. Crucially, Jerome Drevon and Patrick Haenni wrote in <a href=\"https://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/69795\">this 2021 paper</a> for the European University Institute, HTS has consolidated power in Idlib at the expense of more radical Islamic State and al-Qaida factions. And, they say: \u201cHTS\u2019s takeover does not incubate global jihad.\u201d</p> <p>While they are one of the groups who can be seen as having \u201cconfiscated the revolution\u201d from the Syrian people, the patronage of Turkey has constrained their operations.

Ibrahim Al-Assil, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington DC, <a href=\"https://x.com/IbrahimAlAssil/status/1862954616825995364\">warned</a>: \u201cThe actual battle hasn\u2019t started yet.

A key test for the rebels\u2019 evolution will be to know when to stop.\u201d</p> <p>With regime forces consolidating in Hama and Russian airstrikes likely to intensify, HTS\u2019s strength will be severely tested in the days and weeks ahead \u2013 and negotiations between Turkey and Russia are likely to prove as important to the eventual outcome.</p> <p>Many experts also fear that Assad will turn to chemical weapons, just as he did to devastating effect in the darkest days of the civil war.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. Eight years ago, indiscriminate Russian airstrikes helped Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces drive rebels from Aleppo, the country\u2019s second-largest city. Assad\u2019s victory in Aleppo, once a symbolic stronghold of the Syrian rebellion, relied on a brutal \u201csurrender or starve\u201d strategy that killed thousands of civilians and forced many more to flee. It was seen as a turning point in the country\u2019s civil war, which has largely been in a state of stalemate since 2020. But over the weekend, a stunning rebel offensive seized Aleppo again \u2013 leaving the Assad regime facing the greatest threat to its control in years. Yesterday, Syrian and Russian airstrikes pummeled opposition controlled areas in response. Whatever happens next, if the frozen conflict in Syria has become a \u201cforgotten war\u201d as attention has focused on Gaza and Ukraine, it will now be impossible to ignore. Today\u2019s newsletter explains what you need to know. First, here are the headlines. Five big stories US politics | Joe Biden has issued \u201ca full and unconditional\u201d pardon to his son Hunter Biden covering convictions on federal gun and tax charges. Joe Biden, who has repeatedly said that he would not pardon Hunter or commute his sentence, said that his son had been \u201cselectively, and unfairly, prosecuted\u201d. Assisted dying | A new commission on palliative care has been set up to deliver better care for 100,000 people a year in the final stages of their lives. The commission \u2013 instituted after the parliamentary vote last week to legalise assisted dying \u2013 has been launched amid warnings of a postcode lottery in standards across the country. BBC | Outrage over Gregg Wallace\u2019s alleged conduct has intensified after the MasterChef presenter dismissed his accusers as \u201cmiddle-class women of a certain age\u201d. The corporation and other broadcasters are facing growing questions about why Wallace remained on screen despite allegations of inappropriate behaviour dating back to at least 2012. Immigration and asylum | The number of small boat arrivals since Keir Starmer took power has passed 20,000, with the Home Office claiming a record number of calm autumnal days in the Channel was responsible. 6,288 people crossed the Channel over 31 days in October and November, compared with 768 over the same period in 2023. Georgia | Protesters rallied in Georgia\u2019s capital for a fourth consecutive night on Sunday amid signs of widening opposition to the government\u2019s decision to suspend talks on joining the European Union. The crisis deepened after Thursday\u2019s announcement that the government would freeze EU talks for four years. In depth: Why now and how will Assad respond to the attack? The new offensive in Syria began on Wednesday, when rebel groups claimed to have swiftly seized control of a military base and 15 villages held by government forces in north-western Aleppo province. On Thursday, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the rebels, led by the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), cut off the main highway from Damascus to Aleppo and claimed to have seized about 100 sq km of territory, while Assad\u2019s Russian allies launched airstrikes in response. By Friday night, HTS fighters had progressed from their base in the north-western countryside to the outskirts of Aleppo, and yesterday they appeared to have complete control of the city. In this piece, Ruth Michaelson reports on the mixture of optimism and uncertainty among residents, who were stunned by how quickly government forces withdrew: \u201cWe had lost hope of something like this ever happening,\u201d one resident, Nasma, tells her \u2013 but now, \u201cwe felt completely lost\u201d. The Syrian military was meanwhile rushing reinforcements into Hama province as the rebels advanced on the provincial capital. The explanations for this rapid advance are grounded in HTS\u2019s work in recent years to strengthen its forces and a moment of opportunity created by the broader Middle East crisis. But, said Jerome Drevon, a senior analyst at Crisis Group, the rebels\u2019 success also rested on their appetite for the battle. \u201cMost students of wars also insist that many battles are also settled by the willingness to fight,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cThe willingness of the opposition appears much stronger.\u201d *** What is the history of Syria\u2019s civil war? In 2011, pro-democracy demonstrations as part of the Arab spring were crushed by Assad\u2019s forces. The resulting unrest led to an armed uprising that eventually morphed into a fractured civil war, with many rebel factions backed by regional players with competing agendas and the initial demands for a new, pluralistic settlement largely eclipsed by extremist jihadist organisations including an al-Qaida affiliate and Islamic State. Whatever the agenda of those rebel groups and however ruthless some of them may be, many more civilians flee government-held territory for opposition areas than the other way around. The war has killed about half a million people, with almost 7m more fleeing the country as refugees; those who remain are enduring a lasting state of economic crisis. While the rebels once appeared to pose a serious threat to Assad\u2019s rule, he has gradually regained control of about 70% of the country with crucial support from Russia and Iran. The rebels have been confined to parts of the country\u2019s north and north-west, where they hold on with the protection of bordering Turkey. The war has never completely stopped, but has largely been in stalemate since Vladimir Putin and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, brokered a ceasefire in the north-western Idlib region in 2020. *** Why has the conflict restarted? HTS appears to have been preparing for this operation for some time, with reports of major military exercises for several weeks in the autumn and predictions of a major offensive. Experts say that HTS\u2019s forces are significantly more professional than they were at the time of the ceasefire, with a new military college established and full control of local governance in its strongholds. They have new technologies at their disposal including drones. The other critical factor in the advance is the wider geopolitical situation, and a sense that Assad\u2019s allies are distracted or weakened. Hezbollah, an Iranian proxy that has previously been a crucial element in Assad\u2019s forces, has been decimated by Israel\u2019s operations in Lebanon. While Russia remains a major player, and Vladimir Putin will not countenance defeat in the region, Moscow\u2019s forces are undeniably bogged down in Ukraine. Dan Sabbagh has more on all that in this analysis piece. Meanwhile, Israel has dramatically escalated airstrikes against Iranian forces on the ground in Syria and has also hit weapons depots in Aleppo. And Donald Trump, the US president-elect, launched airstrikes against Syrian military sites during his first term, alongside a broader policy of pressure on Iran. Dareen Khalifa, a Syria expert at Crisis Group, told the FT that all of this presented a \u201conce in a lifetime opportunity\u201d for the rebels: \u201cWhen else are you going to ever get the world, the US, Israel and everyone else going after their rivals?\u201d The rebels may also have been motivated by recent Russian and Syrian airstrikes against rebel areas that could have been intended as a precursor to a wider military campaign. There was a limited window of opportunity for the operation, analyst Haid Haid told Ruth Michaelson: \u201cIf the rebel forces waited too long the regime would have been able to reinforce their frontlines as Hezbollah forces are no longer busy with the war in Lebanon.\u201d Notably, the offensive began on the same day the truce in Lebanon came into effect. *** Who are Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham? The founder of HTS, Abu Muhammad al-Jolani, was once a participant in the Iraqi insurgency against the US as a member of the group that eventually became Islamic State. In its former incarnation as Jabhat al-Nusra or the Al-Nusra front, HTS later declared allegiance to al-Qaida. It publicly broke those ties in 2016 and rebranded as Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham \u2013 or \u201cOrganisation for the Liberation of the Levant\u201d. HTS is designated a terrorist group by the US, but it has abandoned its goal of establishing an Islamic state in Syria and is viewed as a less extreme organisation than Islamic State. HTS has become the most powerful rebel faction in Syria and controls Idlib, where about 4 million people live, with command of an estimated 30,000 troops. Crucially, Jerome Drevon and Patrick Haenni wrote in this 2021 paper for the European University Institute, HTS has consolidated power in Idlib at the expense of more radical Islamic State and al-Qaida factions. And, they say: \u201cHTS\u2019s takeover does not incubate global jihad.\u201d While they are one of the groups who can be seen as having \u201cconfiscated the revolution\u201d from the Syrian people, the patronage of Turkey has constrained their operations. There are nonetheless serious human rights concerns in the area they control, including executions for those accused of affiliation with rival groups and over allegations of blasphemy and adultery. *** How will Assad respond? While HTS\u2019s advance has taken place at a remarkable speed, there are good reasons to think that the Assad regime and its allies will fight back \u2013 even given the constraints imposed in other military spheres. Ibrahim Al-Assil, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington DC, warned: \u201cThe actual battle hasn\u2019t started yet. Assad might be applying an old strategy that worked for him before: withdraw, regroup, fortify, and counterattack. A key test for the rebels\u2019 evolution will be to know when to stop.\u201d With regime forces consolidating in Hama and Russian airstrikes likely to intensify, HTS\u2019s strength will be severely tested in the days and weeks ahead \u2013 and negotiations between Turkey and Russia are likely to prove as important to the eventual outcome. Many experts also fear that Assad will turn to chemical weapons, just as he did to devastating effect in the darkest days of the civil war.

Eva Corlett reports Cartoon of the day | Ella Baron The Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world\u2019s not all bad Five years after a devastating fire engulfed Notre Dame Cathedral, it is now nearly ready to reopen to the public after an extensive restoration. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, toured the medieval building, an iconic Parisian symbol, and gave a speech in front of 1,300 craftspeople, honouring those who contributed to the restoration and brought the cathedral back to life. Millions of donors and hundreds of specialist artisans worked tirelessly to preserve this cultural artefact. Before the fire, about 12 million people visited Notre Dame every year, but visitor numbers are expected to soar after the reopening on 7 December. Bored at work?

Hollie Richardson Artist of the Year: Masterclass 6pm, Sky Arts A lovely educational show from the Portrait Artist of the Year team, in which judge Tai-Shan Schierenberg teaches techniques to budding artists. Each masterclass focuses on a different subject, and the opening double bill features \u201cexploring tone\u201d and \u201calla prima\u201d (applying wet paint to wet paint). HR Dispatches: Britain\u2019s Benefits Scandal 8pm, Channel 4 Keir Starmer recently said the country \u201cisn\u2019t working\u201d and pledged to get more people into work, with reforms to overhaul job centres and more mental health funding. But how did we get here? Fraser Nelson investigates all the factors in the broken system and follows people claiming benefits over three months, as well as talking to experts and politicians. HR 24 Hours in Police Custody: Living the High life 9pm, Channel 4 Two seemingly separate crimes \u2013 a fraud perpetrated on a vulnerable elderly man and a county lines drug gang \u2013 turn out to be connected in the latest episode of this formulaic but reliably gripping true-crime strand. The apparently sleepy market town of Biggleswade is the setting for a fascinating if dispiriting tale. Phil Harrison Dune: Prophecy 9pm, Sky Atlantic The brooding and brutal sci-fi prequel exploring the origins of Dune\u2019s influential religious sisterhood goes even further back in time. How did growing up on a bleak planet, where the main natural resource appears to be furry whales, shape the worldview of sisters Valya and Tula? Graeme Virtue Person of Interest 11.05pm, Channel 4 Writer-director Aysha Rafaele\u2019s one-off London noir is bang up to date. Set in August this year, it examines how it is to be a working-class British Muslim in a moment when society\u2019s fabric feels on the verge of rending. Minicab driver Shakil (Asim Chaudhry), beset by crass passengers and the daily horror of news from Gaza, craves peace \u2013 but is he under surveillance? Jack Seale",

How are things with you? Where is your family? I hope you are safe, I hope they are safe. I hope you are OK. We are with you. There is a comfort to it, and also an awkwardness. Comfort because the words are earnest, the solidarity almost unbearably meaningful. Awkward because the scale of what many are enduring is too large to be captured in those words. Everything feels shot through with survivor\u2019s guilt, but also with a little bit of resolve in the knowledge that the calamities tearing apart our nations have closed the distances between us. At the heart of it all is Palestine \u2013 an open trauma that haunts interactions. A muteness has set in, where before there was anger and shock. Added to this is Lebanon. Before the ceasefire, a Lebanese friend told me that it was strange feeling that you may not have a country to return to soon. \u201cShit,\u201d another said, when I asked her what the situation was for her family in Beirut.

It said complaints about the Department for Work and Pensions doubled over this period, and those about higher education rose by 70%. The thinktank released the findings ahead of the publication of its year-long taskforce study into the future of public services with a final report launching this week, saying that politicians urgently need to embrace reform to rebuild trust. It found NHS written complaints rose during the period by 20% to 241,922, doubled at DWP to 120,509 and were up 94% in prisons and probation to 4,575. In higher education, they rose 69% to 3,137. Areas where complaints were broadly flat were local government at 15,438 and social care at 2,982. Alongside the data, the Demos report will call for the running of public services to be devolved away from central government to give communities greater flexibility and discretion over methods of delivery. Speaking about the complaints data, Polly Curtis, chief executive of Demos, said: \u201cAt their very worst, public services feel like a battleground, in which citizens feel they have to fight to get what they need.

Our taskforce has found that if we liberate frontline professionals and devolve power to local places \u2013 with appropriate accountability measures in place \u2013 we can build better services and rebuild trust between politicians and the public.\u201d The report argues that getting public sector productivity back to pre-pandemic levels requires a new model of \u201cliberated\u201d service delivery in which frontline workers are given more power, flexibility and discretion over how they help people. Its analysis estimates that if public services were to be returned to their pre-pandemic productivity levels by 2033 this would deliver \u00a341bn in additional output a year. It highlighted an idea called the \u201cliberated method\u201d, developed by Changing Futures Northumbria in Gateshead, which gives greater freedom to caseworkers as long as they follow two broad rules: \u201cstay legal\u201d and \u201cdo no harm\u201d. The taskforce was advised by experts including Victor Adebowale, chair of the NHS Confederation, Simone Finn, former deputy chief of staff to Boris Johnson, Patricia Hewitt, former Labour health secretary, and Jonathan Slater, former permanent secretary at the Department for Education. It is due to be launched at a future public services summit later this week, addressed by Georgia Gould, the minister for public services reform. Since taking office, Keir Starmer has made clear one of his priorities is fixing crumbling public services, accusing the last Conservative governments of overseeing a decline in standards. He has faced a crisis in prisons, with not enough spaces in jails and prisoners being released earlier in their sentences, and huge waiting lists in the health service, exacerbated by Covid. However, the data shows complaints about many public services were rising even before the pandemic. Last week, Starmer said he was prepared to reform public services to get improvements, alongside investing more money in them. \u201cGiven the unprecedented challenges we have inherited we will not achieve this by simply doing more of the same which is why investment comes alongside a programme of innovation and reform,\u201d he said. In response to the report, Gould said: \u201cAfter the last 14 years, people are too often left feeling like they are going into battle when using public services. \u201cThis government has a relentless focus on delivering for people.

The oldest inscription I can read dates back to 1875, but there are others that are impossible to make out, worn down by 150 years of weather. I spot a jay drinking water from a long-forgotten grave pot. I count a mischief of seven magpies, a volery of long-tailed tits. Among the gravestones are desire paths made by foxes, leading to passageways beneath fences \u2013 portals into unknown gardens. I wonder if there are badgers here. There are holes in trees to check in spring for nesting birds, piles of grass clippings and leaves where a hedgehog might make a nest. In the city proper, the starlings have begun to murmurate, the adults teaching the nervous chicks how to swoop into the bowels of Brighton Pier. Pied wagtails roost in two trees on the busiest road. If we looked up we might see the last of the migrating birds heading south for winter. If we listened at night we might hear the tseep tseep of redwings above the clatter of traffic. But I hunker down in the cemetery, where magpies, jays, foxes and springtails rub shoulders with the dead, where you can hear rain landing on trees, where the yellow of the graffiti matches the yellow of the leaves. \u2022 Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian\u2019s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order at guardianbookshop.com and get a 15% discount",

      "bodyText": "The ruling made headlines across Ireland and around the world, sending women spilling into the streets of Dublin with signs that read \u201cThank you Nikita\u201d. Days after a civil court jury ordered mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor to pay nearly \u20ac250,000 over claims he had \u201cbrutally raped and battered\u201d Nikita Hand, the case has prompted calls for a rethink of how society interacts with power, wealth and a \u201cmanosphere\u201d intent on pushing its own notions of masculinity. The roots of the case trace back to a Dublin hotel penthouse in 2018, where Hand accused McGregor of raping her after she invited him to join her and a friend at a work Christmas party. For two weeks a jury heard Hand\u2019s harrowing testimony: a paramedic who had examined her the next day told the court that she hadn\u2019t seen such severe bruising for a long time, a psychiatrist diagnosed her with PTSD and told how Hand was unable to return to work as a hairdresser after being gripped with night terrors, panic attacks and anxiety. McGregor, a former star with the Ultimate Fighting Championship, denied the allegations, saying that he had \u201cfully consensual sex\u201d with Hand and she had concocted the assault to cover her cheating on her then boyfriend. He has said he will appeal against the jury\u2019s decision. Heard in the high court of Dublin, the case sent shock waves around the world, including the US where McGregor has a huge following. After the ruling, many lined up behind Hand. The Irish justice minister hailed her courage, while a number of businesses and Dublin and Cork airports swiftly stopped selling products associated with McGregor. Some, however, rushed to defend the 36-year-old who last year was described in an Irish Times column as \u201cimmensely famous, with a fervent fanbase, a persona forged in cod-gladiatorial showbusiness, a genius for personal branding and a toxic narcissism that is the political style of our times.\u201d The shows of support sent media in the country scrambling to qualify his appeal, with the chief sports writer for the Irish Mirror likening him to a cult leader. \u201cBut millions around the world bought into the Cult of Conor McGregor,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe has appeared in a big budget Hollywood movie alongside Jake Gyllenhaal. He has hung out with Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. Elon Musk and Russell Brand said he should be President of Ireland.\u201d Others were more blunt in their assessment of what was going on: \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with the men who still insist on defending Conor McGregor?\u201d one columnist asked in the Irish Independent. For Ernesto Vasquez Del Aguila, an assistant professor who teaches a class on masculinities at University College Dublin, the hope was that the case would open a wider space for conversations on violence and masculinities, offering a potent challenge to the \u201cso-called manosphere\u201d. It would be a twist for McGregor, long held up as a certain brand of masculinity following a life laced with violence both inside and out of the ring. He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct after throwing a dolly at a bus carrying UFC fighters in 2018, while in 2019 he was fined after he punched a man in a Dublin bar. \u201cThis is not an isolated case. We men are socialised with the expectation that violence is part of being a man, that we are entitled to women\u2019s bodies, that men are naturally hypersexualised, that \u2018no\u2019 means \u2018try harder\u2019,\u201d Vasquez Del Aguila said in an email. \u201cMen are not naturally \u2018toxic\u2019 or inclined to violence. Society teaches them these roles and we can change these narratives.\u201d In recent years, McGregor had seemingly drifted to the right, clashing with Irish authorities and accusing them of making him into a \u201cscapegoat\u201d after rioting in Dublin. One day before the riots, McGregor posted \u201cIreland, we are at war,\u201d to his 10.3 million followers, while in a later post he added: \u201cThere is a grave danger among us in Ireland that should never be here in the first place.\u201d The impact the ruling would have on McGregor\u2019s fans remains to be seen, said Charlotte Proudman, a barrister who specialises in violence against women and girls. \u201cFor some in his fanbase, I can see this decision reinforcing their admiration for McGregor, as they see his behaviour as a reflection of the dominance and entitlement of women and their bodies often celebrated in toxic masculinity,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cHowever, it could also lead to others who value accountability and respect for women distancing themselves from him.\u201d Among those who have backed McGregor was Andrew Tate, the self-styled \u201cmisogynist influencer\u201d who recently sought to disparage Hand in an X post viewed more than 5m times and which described the jury\u2019s decision as \u201ca bullshit ruling\u201d. Proudman described it as an unsurprising display of solidarity among \u201cthose who normalise violence against women\u201d. While some might brush off these \u201ctoxic dynamics\u201d, Proudman highlighted the grave risks they pose. \u201cThese public defences perpetuate rape myths and embolden others to dismiss or attack survivors.\u201d At the Dublin Rape crisis centre, recent days had offered up glimpses of both extremes of the conversation. Six hours after the jury delivered its decision \u2013 and after Hand, her voice shaking as she spoke outside the courtroom, calling on victims to speak up, fight their fears and keep fighting for justice \u2013 calls to the national rape crisis hotline had surged by 150%, said the centre\u2019s CEORachel Morrogh. At the weekend, as the country grappled with what to make of McGregor after the ruling, calls to the hotline had doubled while first time callers were up more than 50%. \u201cIt\u2019s had a really significant impact,\u201d said Morrogh. At the heart of this was Hand\u2019s tremendous strength in coming forward, she said. \u201cShe demonstrated such courage and bravery in taking not only Conor McGregor on, but she took on his legions of fans as well, who are very vocal in parts of the internet and social media particularly.\u201d But while the case had made clear that women, regardless of their behaviour or their decisions, were never to blame for being raped, it had also laid bare the pervasiveness of negative attitudes and behaviours, said Morrogh. \u201cI also think that underneath what perhaps could be described as a veneer of social progress, there is a toxic stratum,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we saw, mostly in social media commentary, was that when you scratch that veneer, you see the ugliness of what lies beneath.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The capital\u2019s new airport has been opened, two more are in the making, and expectations are high: the Americans are coming to Greenland. On Thursday, the first ever international flight into Nuuk, the most populous settlement on the autonomous Danish territory, landed to cheers on the ground and in the cabin of Air Greenland flight GL781 where passengers were served miniature bottles of Nicolas Feuillatte champagne. The flight took off from Copenhagen, the Danish capital, and it was a sufficiently historic moment for Denmark\u2019s foreign minister to be onboard. It was also a precursor to what could be a more significant development. From June, United Airlines will run a nonstop, four-hour flight from Newark Liberty international airport in New Jersey to Nuuk. It will be the first direct flight to Greenland from the US and is considered to be the beginning of a new era. Airlines ran flights with a combined 55,000 seats to Greenland between April and August; that figure will nearly double next year to about 105,000 seats. Two further airports, in Ilulissat in the west of the territory and Qaqortoq, farther south, both known for their scenic fjords, are expected to be operational by the end of 2026. Not everyone, however, is pleased. Approximately 89% of the population is Greenlandic Inuit and, while surveys indicate strong support for increasing the size of the tourism sector, concerns have been voiced in this community, particularly about the spoiling of the land\u2019s pristine beauty and the potential for foreign companies to leach the profits. This summer, a large cruise ship trying to enter the port of Ilulissat was blockaded over claims that it was providing business solely to foreign-owned tour providers and bringing over its own guides. With next year\u2019s election in mind, the government responded to the concerns last week, passing a contentious tourism law that will come into force on 1 January. A public consultation will lead to a system to classify areas of Greenland into green, yellow, and red zones, restricting access to \u201chigh sensitivity\u201d areas to protect delicate ecosystems already under pressure from the climate emergency, cultural heritage sites, and traditional hunting grounds. There will also be new ownership requirements for tourist businesses. A tourism licence will only be given to someone registered in Greenland and paying tax there.

      "body": "<p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking,\u201d says Esme Wren. She has just told me that she often spends her free time watching old Jeremy Paxman interviews with Tony Blair. Why? Back then, \u201cpoliticians kind of enjoyed it \u2013 they felt like if they passed the Paxman test, it made them a better politician. And they answered the questions, they engaged, they felt that was their duty, to be accountable. So although we weren\u2019t delivered senior members of the cabinet every night, we got our fair share.\u201d The editor of Channel 4 News is remembering her time on the BBC\u2019s Newsnight, which she first worked on in 1998 as an intern, and helmed as editor from 2018 to 2021.</p> <p>Wren is sitting in the cafe-foyer of the ITN building in central London, which houses the broadcast studios of ITV1, ITV London, Channel 4 and Channel 5. Everything about her \u2013 posture, expression, hair, outfit \u2013 is exquisitely composed and radiates calm. She attributes this to her 13 years at Sky between 2005 and 2018: \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a rolling news environment, you learn not to react. My adrenaline\u2019s gone. I\u2019m like Andrew,\u201d she says, wryly. Not someone to laugh at her own jokes, she is referring to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/19/emily-maitlis-prince-andrew-was-unleashed-he-wanted-to-tell-me-everything\">2019 Newsnight interview</a> between Prince Andrew and Emily Maitlis, so dramatic that two TV programmes have been made of it: Prime\u2019s A Very Royal Scandal (in which Wren is played by Lydia Leonard) and Netflix\u2019s Scoop (in which she is played by Romola Garai).</p> <p>Sorry, I\u2019m dancing around a bit \u2013 there is no way Wren would organise her CV other than chronologically \u2013 but you get the picture: at 48, she is one of the most influential figures in broadcast current affairs, and has been at the heart of the news for a quarter of a century.</p>    <p>Events fascinate her the way squirrels fascinate sight hounds; instinctively and irresistibly. But whenever she helicopters out for a second, she can see that the media and political landscape has changed. Politicians don\u2019t really do long broadcast interviews any more. \u201cEverything\u2019s five minutes,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything\u2019s a clip. Everything\u2019s tailored to different audiences. There\u2019s no focal point of accountability.\u201d News has fragmented, generations have fragmented with it, everyone getting their information from a different source, of varying trustworthiness. Channel 4 News has seen growth in audience among under-34s, as well as having the most diverse audience (according to Ofcom). It also has a huge following on TikTok (up 70% since last December) and YouTube (audiences have tuned in for a total 12.2m hours this year) and its Instagram account is \u201cstill beating the BBC\u201d, Wren says. Still, the actual numbers are pretty small: 16- to 34-year-olds only make up 5.7% of Chanel 4 News\u2019s audience.</p> <p>Can traditional modes of news gathering \u2013 where journalists, preferably specialists, report what they see \u2013 survive, in a low-attention-span, high-conflict environment? \u201cSometimes people dismiss younger audiences,\u201d Wren says, \u201cbut they do care about issues, and not just climate change. It\u2019s about housing, it\u2019s about women\u2019s rights. Gaza, that\u2019s where we see the [audience] growth. Ukraine, that\u2019s where we see the growth.\u201d I ask her if she\u2019s making news for the woke generation, and she gives me a \u201cnice try, sunshine\u201d look. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we\u2019re in their lives, and in their feeds, without diluting what we are for a digital world.\u201d</p> <p>Wren tells her life by the news: she mainly remembers her school days because a history teacher gave her a chunk of the Berlin Wall. She grew up in Portsmouth, in a large, tight-knit Catholic family. She and her three sisters were sent to a not particularly academic church-run boarding school, while her two brothers remained at home. \u201c\u2018The princes,\u2019 as we called them.\u201d She describes her school pretty briskly and not in glowing terms. \u201cDespite what many people think of those in holy orders, there were some good eggs. It toughens you up, gives you a thick skin. I was lucky to have my sisters there.\u201d Then she squares that off with \u201cI spent 13 years there,\u201d and I realise she went when she was just five.</p>    <p>She survived to go on and study at Bristol university, swapping from dentistry to politics, then went to University of California, Los Angeles in 1996 on a Fulbright scholarship to study political science. That was an amazing course, with genuine-article advisers to Bill Clinton coming to guest-lecture and students doing original research projects on the 1996 US presidential election as it happened. \u201cI regretted not being in the UK in 1997, because it felt like a real turning point,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd in America, Blair\u2019s victory was unnoticed.\u201d She feels fortunate to have arrived back in time for the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. When she describes the signal moments of any era \u2013 sudden violent death, outbreaks of war, augurs of fascism \u2013 Wren often feels \u201cfortunate\u201d or \u201cprivileged\u201d that they happened on her watch (or rather, while she was watching). She never bothers with a preface about things being sad. There\u2019s an unspoken: \u201cOf course it\u2019s sad, now we have to get on and report it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I genuinely feel I don\u2019t have a political position, that I have trained myself to have an open mind about what we witness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So on her first day on Newsnight in 1998, she scored a placement from the programme\u2019s other female editor, Sian Kevill. \u201cI feel so fortunate for the moment in history, the invasion of Kosovo. It was an incredible story. Those first few days were just all hands on deck \u2013 nobody even noticed I was new. Half the office hadn\u2019t even clocked I was there.\u201d She was assigned as a researcher to Mark Urban and got her foot in the door: Kirsty Wark was incredible, low-key kind and supportive, which is sort of what you\u2019d expect; Jeremy Paxman was scary and exacting, but not in a mean way, only in the service of creating more scary and exacting journalists. Martha Kearney dragooned her down to work on Westminster politics, that golden age she still goes back to rewatch, when ministers didn\u2019t \u201cslither away from the question\u201d. Wren has the unmistakable stamp of a BBC apprenticeship \u2013 which is not to say that only the Beeb\u2019s journalists are truly impartial, but that only they claim to be with such a straight face. \u201cTo be honest with you, I genuinely feel I don\u2019t have a political position. I\u2019ve been in journalism for so long, I\u2019ve only ever done public service broadcasting, I\u2019ve never worked anywhere where a stance could be taken. I feel I have trained myself in that way, to genuinely have an open mind about what we witness, without being coloured by any form of judgment.\u201d It\u2019s such a vast, contestable question, whether you can even meaningfully seek the truth without that entailing some form of judgment, but the more serious current affairs people are, the more seriously they cling to this idea of their tabula rasa minds.<strong> </strong>It\u2019s how they\u2019re made.</p> <p>In 2005, Wren took six months off to go travelling in South America, which informed her next move. She says she probably wouldn\u2019t have gone to Sky News from the BBC, because breaking news was considered a bit trashy (my word) in those days. Wren was brought in to make an \u201cappointment to view\u201d news show, The Sky Report, to rival Channel 4 News. \u201cWe never put a dent on their figures,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter about a year, they realised it wasn\u2019t worth the money.\u201d</p> <p>She stayed with Sky for 13 years, where she became head of politics and specialist journalism. The team covered the leaders\u2019 debate for the 2015 election and the Brexit referendum, and built a lineup that would go on to become stars: Beth Rigby, Sophie Ridge, Ed Conway and Faisal Islam. She had two daughters, in 2007 and 2009: \u201cI\u2019ve been single since they were little. I wasn\u2019t intending that, obviously. Things just changed, when they were one and three. It made it easier in some respects. You could set up a home that you felt comfortable in. I wanted to show the girls you could have a career \u2013 that\u2019s been really important to me. They\u2019re really interested in politics \u2013 they know a lot just by osmosis. And you know, I was only in Isleworth. I wasn\u2019t in Afghanistan.\u201d</p>    <p>I had my kids at the same time, and while I definitely cannot match Wren\u2019s passion for news, I do remember feeling vexed that so much seemed to <em>happen</em> while I was in soft play \u2013 the financial crash, then more crashing, the eurozone crisis, Barack Obama! \u201cFunnily enough, the handover between Blair and Brown was when my first baby was four months old. And I came back in to do it. I just needed to be there to witness it, Blair being clapped out of the Commons, Brown\u2019s speech in Downing Street.\u201d The 00s can\u2019t hold a candle to the 10s, in terms of sheer event, nor the 10s to the 20s. \u201cYou feel very privileged to be a journalist at this stage,\u201d Wren says. \u201cIt\u2019s a complex world that we live in, and it requires a lot of explanation. With certain stories, we\u2019re very cognisant of what it\u2019s doing to the team, having to live and breathe them. Of course, it beats you down. But for me, it\u2019s a privilege to have the time and space to think deeply about those stories, what\u2019s driving them and how to present them to an audience.\u201d</p> <p>Wren remembers with satisfaction Michael Gove\u2019s (in my view idiotic) \u201cwe\u2019ve all had enough of experts\u201d line that came out on her Sky show during the Brexit referendum. But of the wider job \u2013 explaining to the country how incredibly knotty, complex, tedious and time-consuming it would be \u2013 she says: \u201cI think all of us have to hold our hands up that we probably didn\u2019t do enough.\u201d</p> <p>When she went back to Newsnight in 2018, though, Brexit \u201cplayed perfectly. Our figures were great, it was a story that needed Newsnight to explain it. The timing played well \u2013 often the votes were late. And politicians were engaging, they wanted to talk. It was good for business.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think all of us have to hold our hands up that we probably didn\u2019t do enough on Brexit</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Then, the following year, Andrew: the famous interview, in which Emily Maitlis walked the prince to his own disgrace, seemingly effortlessly.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI\u2019m not joking,\u201d says Esme Wren. She has just told me that she often spends her free time watching old Jeremy Paxman interviews with Tony Blair. Why? Back then, \u201cpoliticians kind of enjoyed it \u2013 they felt like if they passed the Paxman test, it made them a better politician. And they answered the questions, they engaged, they felt that was their duty, to be accountable. So although we weren\u2019t delivered senior members of the cabinet every night, we got our fair share.\u201d The editor of Channel 4 News is remembering her time on the BBC\u2019s Newsnight, which she first worked on in 1998 as an intern, and helmed as editor from 2018 to 2021. Wren is sitting in the cafe-foyer of the ITN building in central London, which houses the broadcast studios of ITV1, ITV London, Channel 4 and Channel 5. Everything about her \u2013 posture, expression, hair, outfit \u2013 is exquisitely composed and radiates calm. She attributes this to her 13 years at Sky between 2005 and 2018: \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a rolling news environment, you learn not to react. My adrenaline\u2019s gone. I\u2019m like Andrew,\u201d she says, wryly. Not someone to laugh at her own jokes, she is referring to the 2019 Newsnight interview between Prince Andrew and Emily Maitlis, so dramatic that two TV programmes have been made of it: Prime\u2019s A Very Royal Scandal (in which Wren is played by Lydia Leonard) and Netflix\u2019s Scoop (in which she is played by Romola Garai). Sorry, I\u2019m dancing around a bit \u2013 there is no way Wren would organise her CV other than chronologically \u2013 but you get the picture: at 48, she is one of the most influential figures in broadcast current affairs, and has been at the heart of the news for a quarter of a century. Events fascinate her the way squirrels fascinate sight hounds; instinctively and irresistibly. But whenever she helicopters out for a second, she can see that the media and political landscape has changed. Politicians don\u2019t really do long broadcast interviews any more. \u201cEverything\u2019s five minutes,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything\u2019s a clip. Everything\u2019s tailored to different audiences. There\u2019s no focal point of accountability.\u201d News has fragmented, generations have fragmented with it, everyone getting their information from a different source, of varying trustworthiness. Channel 4 News has seen growth in audience among under-34s, as well as having the most diverse audience (according to Ofcom). It also has a huge following on TikTok (up 70% since last December) and YouTube (audiences have tuned in for a total 12.2m hours this year) and its Instagram account is \u201cstill beating the BBC\u201d, Wren says. Still, the actual numbers are pretty small: 16- to 34-year-olds only make up 5.7% of Chanel 4 News\u2019s audience. Can traditional modes of news gathering \u2013 where journalists, preferably specialists, report what they see \u2013 survive, in a low-attention-span, high-conflict environment? \u201cSometimes people dismiss younger audiences,\u201d Wren says, \u201cbut they do care about issues, and not just climate change. It\u2019s about housing, it\u2019s about women\u2019s rights. Gaza, that\u2019s where we see the [audience] growth. Ukraine, that\u2019s where we see the growth.\u201d I ask her if she\u2019s making news for the woke generation, and she gives me a \u201cnice try, sunshine\u201d look. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we\u2019re in their lives, and in their feeds, without diluting what we are for a digital world.\u201d Wren tells her life by the news: she mainly remembers her school days because a history teacher gave her a chunk of the Berlin Wall. She grew up in Portsmouth, in a large, tight-knit Catholic family. She and her three sisters were sent to a not particularly academic church-run boarding school, while her two brothers remained at home. \u201c\u2018The princes,\u2019 as we called them.\u201d She describes her school pretty briskly and not in glowing terms. \u201cDespite what many people think of those in holy orders, there were some good eggs. It toughens you up, gives you a thick skin. I was lucky to have my sisters there.\u201d Then she squares that off with \u201cI spent 13 years there,\u201d and I realise she went when she was just five. She survived to go on and study at Bristol university, swapping from dentistry to politics, then went to University of California, Los Angeles in 1996 on a Fulbright scholarship to study political science. That was an amazing course, with genuine-article advisers to Bill Clinton coming to guest-lecture and students doing original research projects on the 1996 US presidential election as it happened. \u201cI regretted not being in the UK in 1997, because it felt like a real turning point,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd in America, Blair\u2019s victory was unnoticed.\u201d She feels fortunate to have arrived back in time for the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.

She never bothers with a preface about things being sad.

      "bodyText": "More than 1,500 Woolworths warehouse workers have been on strike since 21 November, seeking better pay and safety on the job. Industrial action has affected up to five distribution centres run by Primary Connect, the supermarket giant\u2019s supply chain arm. The United Workers Union (UWU) is demanding a wage rise for workers. It also wants Woolies to scrap a productivity framework imposed on workers. In October, Guardian Australia revealed concerns from staff in Woolworths warehouses about the efficiency crackdown, including that they were being tracked and pushed to comply with unrealistic and risky standards. Why are workers on strike? The UWU wants a pay increase to at least $38 an hour for staff, with additional percentage increases in following years, as well as consistent wages and conditions across distribution centres. The union also wants the company to scrap a \u201cCoaching and Productivity Framework\u201d introduced at some sites in late 2023, which aimed to enforce an \u201cefficiency rate\u201d of 100%. For example, workers who \u201cpick\u201d \u2013 a task that involves wearing a headset which directs which items to take from shelves and how long it should take \u2013 have their performance tracked and measured. If they don\u2019t meet efficiency targets, consequences can range from coaching, disciplinary action to even loss of employment, according to documents seen by Guardian Australia. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Workers told the Guardian the framework was a \u201cbullying\u201d tactic, and putting safety at risk. \u201cIt\u2019s just pressure, pressure, pressure,\u201d one said. It was paused after worker pushback, but there are fears it will be reintroduced. At the time, a Primary Connect spokesperson said the framework helped with applying a fair approach for workers, and that it was committed to safety and productivity at its sites. Where is affected by the strike? Indefinite strike action began on 21 November at four warehouses across New South Wales and Victoria. They are the Melbourne Liquor Distribution Centre, the Melbourne South Regional Distribution Centre, the Erskine Park Distribution Centre and the Barnawartha North distribution centre. Since then, staff at the Queensland Heathwood distribution centre, located 20km south-west of Brisbane\u2019s CBD, also commenced industrial action, though have since returned to work. Staff at Lineage cold storage shed at Laverton, a Melbourne cold storage warehouse that supplies Woolworths stores, have also walked out. Is the strike having an impact on stores? Yes, the strikes are affecting the flow of goods into Woolworths retail stores. Guardian Australia found no supply of cold drinks in one Melbourne CBD Metro location, with a sign in the store advising of delays due to industrial action, while there was a reported shortage of snacks and paper towels at Woolworths Vermont. A spokesperson for Woolworths confirmed on Sunday there was \u201climited stock flow\u201d in some stores in Victoria, NSW and the ACT, but did not list them. What does Woolworths say? Woolworths has pushed back against UWU demands, and claimed the wages it wants are well above inflation during a time of \u201ccost-of-living pressures\u201d for customers. On Sunday, Woolworths announced it would reopen its Primary Connect Melbourne South Regional Distribution Centre due to stock issues, leading workers to maintain a picket line Monday. The reopening has not gone ahead so far. Has anyone endorsed Woolworths' pay offer? UWU and Woolworths met for negotiations today, but no agreement was reached. \u201cWe are hopeful of a breakthrough because our workers deserve to be safe at work,\u201d the UWU national secretary, Tim Kennedy, said. Woolworths said in its statement on Sunday that the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees\u2019 Association (SDA) had endorsed a \u201ccompetitive\u201d pay offer from Woolworths, which an SDA spokesperson confirmed, though it was not publicly disclosed. The grocery giant described the offer as \u201cabove industry standards, above local market rates, above inflation, and approximately 40% above the Storage Services Award\u201d. Both the SDA and UWU operate in Primary Connect distribution centres, however SDA is the minority union. \u201cThe other union referred to by Woolworths, which largely represents retail workers, has less than 10 members affected by the framework in this dispute, compared to the 1,500 United Workers Union members on strike,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement. SDA declined to comment, while Woolworths did not respond to a request for comment by deadline.",

The bear was put to sleep before being killed, the Kyodo news agency said. Authorities in parts of northern Japan are struggling to address the rising number of encounters between humans and bears that have left their natural habitat in search of food. Residents have been told to remain vigilant, including those in urban areas, as the animals prepare to go into hibernation, while some have warned that the scarcity of food means that some hungry animals will continue to forage during the colder months. Authorities reported 219 casualties, including six deaths, from bear attacks across 19 of Japan\u2019s 47 prefectures in the 12 months to March this year \u2013 the highest figure since nationwide data became available. Fluctuating harvests of bears\u2019 staple foods and rural depopulation have been cited as factors in the rise in ursine encounters, while experts believe a steady fall in the number of children, whose noisier behaviour helps keeps bears away, is another factor behind the rise in incidents in country towns and villages. The injured man in Akita was attacked while working near the supermarket\u2019s delicatessen section before the store opened early on Saturday. Another worker helped him to the safety of a storage area before calling police, Kyodo said. The store was closed and there were no shoppers inside at the time. Several bear sightings had been reported in the neighbourhood, located near the centre of Akita city, in recent days. The prefecture was the scene of two high-profile incidents last year, including one in which a man lost part of an ear after finding a bear in his garage, and another in which several people were mauled at a bus stop. Japan\u2019s bear population is growing, with one estimate putting the number of black bears at 44,000 \u2013 compared with 15,000 estimated in 2012. That figure does not include Hokkaido, thought to be home to just under 12,000 Ussuri brown bears, whose population has more than doubled since 1990.",

      "bodyText": "Joe Biden has issued \u201ca full and unconditional\u201d pardon to his son Hunter Biden covering convictions on federal gun and tax charges, the US president said in a statement released by the White House on Sunday. The decision marks a reversal for the president, who had repeatedly said he would not use his executive authority to pardon his son or commute his sentence. Hunter Biden was scheduled to be sentenced for his conviction on federal gun charges on 12 December. He was scheduled to be sentenced in the tax case four days later. In the statement, Joe Biden said that he had long maintained that he would \u201cnot interfere with the Justice Department\u2019s decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted\u201d. But, he argued, \u201cit is clear that Hunter was treated differently\u201d, adding that the charges in the case \u201ccame about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election\u201d. Hunter Biden was found guilty in Delaware in June on three felony counts relating to his purchase of a handgun in 2018. He had written on his gun-purchase form, falsely, that he was not a user of illicit drugs. He pleaded guilty to nine federal tax charges in Los Angeles in September, opting for an \u201copen\u201d plea, where a defendant pleads guilty to the charges and leaves his sentencing fate in the hands of the judge. The tax charges carried up to 17 years behind bars and the gun charges were punishable by up to 25 years, though federal sentencing guidelines were expected to call for far less time and it was possible the president\u2019s son would have avoided prison time entirely. The pardon covers all \u201coffenses against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024, including but not limited to all offenses charged or prosecuted\u201d. Joe Biden said on Sunday evening that his son had been prosecuted when \u201cwithout aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form\u201d. He noted in the statement that \u201cthose who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions\u201d. Biden accused his political opponents of singling out his 54-year-old son. \u201cNo reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter\u2019s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son \u2013 and that is wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been an effort to break Hunter \u2013 who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they\u2019ve tried to break me \u2013 and there\u2019s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.\u201d Biden departed for Angola later on Sunday evening for what may be his last foreign trip as president before leaving office. Speculation had been mounting that the president would issue a pardon since Hunter was seen with his father in Nantucket over the Thanksgiving break. Donald Trump had said in October that he would not be surprised if Hunter Biden were to receive a pardon. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t take it off the books,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSee, unlike Joe Biden, despite what they\u2019ve done to me, where they\u2019ve gone after me so viciously \u2026 And Hunter\u2019s a bad boy.\u201d On Sunday, Trump reacted with outrage, writing on his social network: \u201cDoes the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years? Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!\u201d Just one day earlier, though, Trump had reminded Americans that he himself had previously used the pardon power to wipe away convictions of those close to him.

On Saturday, Trump announced plans to nominate the elder Kushner to be the US ambassador to France. Republicans have long zeroed in on Hunter Biden\u2019s difficulties \u2013 questions around lucrative foreign consultancies, broken relationships and a crack cocaine addiction \u2013 in an effort to politically damage his father. A laptop Hunter Biden left in a Delaware repair shop that made its way into Republican hands formed a scandal in the closing days of the 2020 election. Republicans claimed that the so-called \u201claptop from hell\u201d, which featured images of Hunter posing with guns, sex workers and crack cocaine, was suppressed by media favorable to Democrats. Hunter Biden later published a book, Beautiful Things: a Memoir, that detailed his struggles as a drug addict. The Biden family denied more serious accusations that Hunter\u2019s profitable financial arrangements with businesspeople in Ukraine and China amounted to graft using the family name. James Comer, one of the Republicans leading congressional investigations into Biden\u2019s family, denounced the pardon. \u201cThe charges Hunter faced were just the tip of the iceberg in the blatant corruption that President Biden and the Biden Crime Family have lied about to the American people,\u201d Comer wrote on X. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that, rather than come clean about their decades of wrongdoing, President Biden and his family continue to do everything they can to avoid accountability.\u201d \u201cI have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction \u2013 mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport,\u201d Hunter Biden said in a statement on Sunday, adding he had remained sober for more than five years. \u201cIn the throes of addiction, I squandered many opportunities and advantages \u2026 I will never take the clemency I have been given today for granted and will devote the life I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and suffering.\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s legal team filed Sunday night in both Los Angeles and Delaware asking the judges handling his gun and tax cases to immediately dismiss them, citing the pardon.

      "bodyText": "More than a dozen people have been charged over an alleged multimillion dollar attempted import of cocaine into Australia, the largest in the nation\u2019s history. Australian federal police charged 11 men and two juveniles with conspiring to import 2.34 tonnes of cocaine into the country by sea. Authorities claim they busted the attempt by a transnational organised crime syndicate to import the illegal drug with a street value of about $760m that would have equated to 11.7m individual street deals. The arrests were triggered after a recreational fishing boat police were tracking ran into mechanical trouble and became stranded about 18km off the north-eastern tip of the Queensland sand island of K\u2019gari (also known as Fraser Island), forcing the Australian federal police and Queensland police service to execute multiple arrests at sea, in the Bundaberg region and Brisbane. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email AFP Cmdr Stephen Jay told press in Brisbane on Monday that the fishing vessel \u2013 or \u201cdaughter boat\u201d \u2013 had rendezvoused with a mother ship in international waters 460km off the Queensland coast to collect the cocaine. Jay said it was the second ill-fated attempt by the syndicate to import drugs via the Queensland coast after a previous attempt using another boat also saw that vessel break down. The alleged traffickers recently bought the replacement boat for $150,000. In addition to this spate of arrests, Jay said there had been \u201cmultiple people\u201d rescued while attempting to retrieve drugs at sea in recent times. He said the sting came on the back of intelligence received last month that sparked a joint investigation between the AFP and QPS. One of the arrests took place at a nightclub in Brisbane, while two men aged 43 and 44 were arrested near the Bundaberg coast awaiting the boat\u2019s arrival. In Brisbane, police also searched a house in Victoria Point and arrested its 51-year-old male resident. All 13 of the accused drug traffickers are charged with the single count of conspiracy to import the 2.34 tonnes of cocaine, a commercial quantity of border-controlled drugs which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. \u201cInvestigations into the origin of the drugs remain ongoing and we will work with our international and domestic law enforcement partners to identify the criminal syndicates and anyone else involved in facilitating this alleged drug import,\u201d Jay said. \u201cLet these arrests serve as a warning to those criminal syndicates plotting attempts to bring illicit substances into our country, we stand together ready to act and disrupt your criminal activities, together with our law enforcement partners.\u201d The amount of cocaine allegedly attempted to be imported weighs the same as a Ford Raptor ute. Police investigations began in November after intel led authorities to a criminal syndicate allegedly linked to the Comanchero gang. All 13 will face the Maryborough, Bundaberg and Cleveland magistrates courts on Monday. The drug bust comes after police seized more than $160m worth of the illicit substance in April. Under Operation Orion last month, Colombian authorities, working with dozens of other countries, set a global record for any single anti-narcotics operation, seizing 225 tonnes of cocaine in the space of six weeks. Jay would not be drawn on whether this bust was linked to that investigation but did say Australia police were \u201cvery well served\u201d by intelligence. \u201cObviously we have, through our international network, the ability to reach into Colombia and that will be, certainly, one of the aspects we\u2019ll look at,\u2019 he told press. Operation Orion interrupted a \u201cnarco submarine\u201d travelling on a new drug trafficking route to Australia, however Jay said the mother ship in this latest bust off Queensland was not a submersible vessel. The origin of the drugs was still being investigated, he said. It was branded with a white horse on a red circle and the words \u201cFord Mustang\u201d. It was transported in 1kg blocks roped together in 51 bales. \u201cThere is a degree of pride for some of these syndicates around their drugs,\u201d Jay said. \u201cThey do brand them.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "New South Wales have brought back Laurie Daley as State of Origin coach almost a decade after his initial stint in the role, while Craig Bellamy has been drafted in to work with Daley in a new advisory role. Outgoing coach Michael Maguire led the Blues to a series win in his first year in charge but left in September to take up a job with the Brisbane Broncos. Daley, who won five series as a player for the Blues, has coached the Indigenous All Stars and appeared in the media spruiking odds for gambling company Tab in the years since his departure. He said on Monday he loves his state and the job of coaching, and never thought he\u2019d be given another opportunity. \u201cMichael Maguire did a fantastic job last year, and we\u2019re hoping to continue on what he left behind,\u201d Daley said. The appointment had been widely speculated, but the addition of Bellamy came as a surprise. Daley said the New South Wales Rugby League approached Bellamy prior to his appointment, and the pair discussed their respective roles before the arrangement \u2013 which will include Bellamy\u2019s input on selection \u2013 was agreed. Bellamy will juggle his Blues duties with his job as coach at the Melbourne Storm, and Daley will spend some time with Bellamy in the Storm coaches box during the season. \u201cHe\u2019s a great mentor, he\u2019s someone that\u2019s got huge amount of experience in the game, and he\u2019s someone that we can all learn a lot from,\u201d Daley said. Storm chief executive Justin Rodski said the club was supportive of Bellamy\u2019s appointment. \u201cThe timing of our byes this season will give Craig the flexibility to spend time with the NSW team, without compromising his commitments to Storm.\u201d The Storm have byes in round 12 and 15 this year, the weeks preceding games one and two of the State of Origin series. Daley returns to the Origin arena as the Blues\u2019 third most-experienced coach and only Phil Gould and Brad Fittler have coached more games. His initial stint as coach came during a period of dominance for Queensland, and he lost nine of his 15 matches. The 55-year-old broke through for a series win in his second season in 2014, when Blues halfback Trent Hodkinson scored the only try in a memorable game two. But Daley\u2019s tenure was marred by criticism about the former five-eighth\u2019s coaching ability, and he has never coached at NRL level. Daley said he accepted there will be doubts over his appointment given his relative lack of recent experience. \u201cAll you can do is do your best, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing.\u201d He said he has improved as a coach since he was last coaching in State of Origin. \u201cI\u2019d like to think I\u2019m a better coach, I\u2019d like to think I\u2019ve learned a lot,\u201d he said, highlighting he believes he is now more mature. Maguire overcame defeat in the first match earlier this year to win the third in Brisbane, the first time the Blues have won a decider in Brisbane since 2005. Roosters NRLW coach John Strange has been appointed coach of the women\u2019s State of Origin side, replacing Kylie Hilder who decided to stand down after a 2-1 series loss in 2024.",

      "bodyText": "Growth expectations among UK companies have taken \u201ca decisive turn for the worse\u201d, in a fresh blow to Rachel Reeves amid warnings that business confidence has plummeted since the budget. For the first time this year, expectations for growth have turned negative, according to the Confederation of British Industry\u2019s latest growth indicator, which shows that a majority of companies expect activity to decline in the three months to February. Business volumes in the services sector are anticipated to decline, including in consumer services, with more firms in the business and professional services sectors expecting a drop in activity than a rise in the next three months. The gloomier outlook comes as private sector activity declined again in the three months to November, according to the CBI, with all three major sectors \u2013 services, manufacturing, and wholesale and retail \u2013 reporting falling business volumes, sales or output. Reeves\u2019s budget, at the end of October, contained \u00a340bn of tax rises including \u00a325bn from increasing the national insurance contributions (NICs) paid by companies. The chancellor has said the decisions were necessary to stabilise the public finances, and fund better public services. Alpesh Paleja, the CBI\u2019s interim deputy chief economist, said: \u201cAs we head into 2025, expectations for growth have taken a decisive turn for the worse. Our surveys suggest that anticipated activity was already weakening heading into the October budget, and the chancellor\u2019s announcements have left businesses with even more tough choices to make. \u201cNews that firms are planning to reduce headcount is a concern, with hiring intentions at their weakest since the tail end of the Covid-19 pandemic. This could be an early sign of the impact of higher labour costs from the upcoming rise in employer NICs, and the uprating in the national living wage.\u201d The CBI is calling on the government to move \u201cquickly and decisively to reform business rates, deliver apprenticeship levy flexibility, and boost occupational health incentives to support the health of the workforce\u201d. Business leaders are worried about the UK government\u2019s ability to achieve growth over the next five years. The London Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) said it acknowledged the government\u2019s need to take tough decisions to help repair public finances but believes the policies announced in the budget and employment rights bill created a \u201cperfect storm\u201d for businesses in the capital. It said the government would be unable to achieve the long-term growth it has made a cornerstone of its strategy. About 81% of business leaders who are members of the chamber said they were not confident that the government would listen to and address concerns from the business community, and 77% were not confident that the government would succeed in its commitment to economic growth. Business confidence has plunged to its lowest level since the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a separate report from the Institute of Directors at the weekend. Its economic confidence index, which measures business leader optimism in prospects for the UK economy, fell to -65 in November from -52 in October, the fourth monthly fall in a row. That is the lowest reading since the record low of -69 in April 2020. The LCCI\u2019s snap survey of more than 200 business leaders showed almost four-fifths of businesses of all sizes said that increased employer national insurance would negatively or very negatively affect their business, leading to almost half predicting a hiring freeze and lower pay for staff in the coming years. Firms are also concerned about the employment rights bill, with 38% predicting the changes will mean a hiring freeze, while 16% warn it will lead to job losses. Just over three-quarters feel that the government has not meaningfully engaged with businesses on the measures, which include protection against unfair dismissal for employees from day one; a universal entitlement to sick pay from the first day of illness; changes to the minimum wage and giving more than 1 million people on zero-hours contracts the right to gain guaranteed working hours if they want them. Karim Fatehi, the chief executive of the London chamber, said: \u201cThis snap survey has confirmed our worst fears; the business community views the combined package of increased employer national insurance contributions, cuts to business rates relief and the employment rights bill as a serious threat to their operations over the coming years. \u201cIt also shows that London businesses are fast losing faith in the government\u2019s economic growth strategy. Having weathered a cost of living crisis, soaring inflation, higher borrowing costs, and trade tensions, businesses need the operating conditions conducive to economic growth rather than measures that curtail their ability to invest in their business, hire new people and train their staff.\u201d Family businesses are worried about changes to inheritance tax (IHT), with just over a fifth saying they were likely to wind up their family businesses instead of passing them on, according to the LCCI survey. Weighing in on the IHT debate, research by the CBI\u2019s economic consultancy found that the decision to cap business property relief at \u00a31m could lead to more than 125,000 job losses in the coming years and lead to a significant reduction in economic activity and lower tax revenues.

Criticising the pace of remediation, more than seven years after the Grenfell Tower fire killed 72 people, the deputy prime minister announced an acceleration plan on Monday for buildings of 18 metres and over, which will include severe penalties for freeholders who fail to act. She also said that by the end of 2029, every building of 11 metres and over with unsafe cladding would either have been fixed or have a completion date for remedial work, otherwise landlords would face hefty fines. Ministers claimed it was the first time a target date had been set to make buildings safe. But the End Our Cladding Scandal campaign coalition said it was not the \u201cmeaningful change\u201d it was hoping for, which the government had pledged in opposition, and just added more layers of bureaucracy. Rayner said: \u201cMore than seven years on from the Grenfell tragedy, thousands of people have been left living in homes across this country with dangerous cladding. The pace of remediation has been far too slow for far too long. We are taking decisive action to right this wrong and make homes safe. \u201cOur remediation acceleration plan will ensure those responsible for making buildings safe deliver the change residents need and deserve.\u201d The announcement of the plan follows letters sent by Rayner, the secretary of state for housing, to organisations responsible for fixing residential buildings with unsafe cladding, setting out new deadlines for the commencement of works and telling them they must act now or face the consequences. The government said it has been engaging with mayors, local enforcement agencies and developers since July to address the unacceptably slow pace of remediation. As well as identifying all unsafe buildings \u2013 the government hopes to have reviewed more than 95% of buildings 11 metres and over by the end of next year \u2013 and fixing them faster, the other main objective of the joint action plan is to protect residents from the financial burden of remediation. Developers will double the rate at which they fix the buildings they are responsible for under the plan, which will be backed by investment in enforcement so that councils, fire and rescue authorities and the building safety regulator have the capacity to tackle hundreds of cases a year. The government said that only 30% of buildings in England identified to be at risk have been remediated, with potentially thousands more yet to be identified. As well as living in fear, residents have been hit with higher insurance and service charges and stuck with flats they cannot sell. End Our Cladding Scandal believes that as many as 11,000 buildings taller than 11 metres may still be at risk from combustible cladding. Giles Grover, from the campaign, said of the announcement: \u201cIt\u2019s not really going to make much of a difference on the ground, it\u2019s just making an already complicated approach even more complicated. And to be honest, at this stage, it all feels a bit performative, really. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s any oversight, you\u2019ve got too many funding schemes rather than a properly joined-up approach. It just looks like they\u2019ve just added further layers of bureaucracy, it\u2019s all still too vague.\u201d He said Labour should do what it proposed in 2021 and create a government-funded building works agency to decide what works are necessary, then commission and pay for them. Grover added that there were issues that hadn\u2019t been considered, including buildings under 11 metres and leaseholders who did not qualify to be protected from remediation costs. The government\u2019s announcement comes on the same day as MPs will debate the findings of the Grenfell Tower inquiry\u2019s final report in parliament.

      "bodyText": "\u201cBrain rot\u201d has been announced as the Oxford word of the year for 2024, amid concerns over endless social media scrolling and mind-numbing content. More than 37,000 people voted to help choose the winner from a shortlist of six words drawn up by Oxford University Press, the publisher of the Oxford English Dictionary. Its annual award, whose previous winners have included \u201crizz\u201d and \u201cclimate emergency\u201d, aims to reflect the moods and trends of the year. Brain rot is defined as \u201cthe supposed deterioration of a person\u2019s mental or intellectual state, especially viewed as the result of overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging\u201d. Oxford University Press said the term \u201cgained new prominence in 2024 as a term used to capture concerns about the impact of consuming excessive amounts of low-quality online content, especially on social media\u201d. Despite its recent rise to prominence, its first recorded use was in Henry David Thoreau\u2019s book Walden in 1854. Casper Grathwohl, Oxford Languages president, said: \u201cBrain rot speaks to one of the perceived dangers of virtual life, and how we are using our free time. It feels like a rightful next chapter in the cultural conversation about humanity and technology. It\u2019s not surprising that so many voters embraced the term, endorsing it as our choice this year. \u201cI also find it fascinating that the word brain rot has been adopted by gen Z and gen Alpha, those communities largely responsible for the use and creation of the digital content the term refers to.\u201d The five unsuccessful shortlisted words included \u201cdemure\u201d, which rose to prominence following a social media trend during the summer that refers to reserved or responsible behaviour; \u201cdynamic pricing\u201d, where the price of a product or service varies to reflect demand; \u201clore\u201d, a body of facts and background information related to someone or something; \u201cromantasy\u201d, a fiction genre combining romance and fantasy; and \u201cslop\u201d, low-quality content online generated using artificial intelligence. The shortlist was decided by a panel of four experts, chaired by lexicographer Susie Dent, best known for her appearances on Channel 4\u2019s Countdown. Oxford University Press took the public vote into account as it chose the winner, as well as public commentary and other analysis before announcing it on Sunday evening. Recent winners of the Oxford prize include \u201crizz\u201d, an abbreviation of the word charisma, which took the title last year. \u201cGoblin mode\u201d took the crown in 2022 and the pandemic-era \u201cvax\u201d won in 2021. Across the Oxbridge divide, Cambridge Dictionary\u2019s word of the year was announced last month as \u201cmanifest\u201d, which is a wellness trend to imagine achieving a goal in the hope it will make it more likely to happen. The word had been searched 130,000 times on the Cambridge Dictionary website. Social media trends were also linked to \u201cdemure\u201d being awarded as Dictionary.com\u2019s winner, linked to a TikTok movement during the summer advising people to be reserved and mindful in their behaviour. Another summer craze led Collins Dictionary to make \u201cbrat\u201d its word of the year, after Charli xcx\u2019s hit album of the same name released in June.",
