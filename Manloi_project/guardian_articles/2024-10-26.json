Here are the major developments from today:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Michelle Obama</strong> joined <strong>Kamala Harris</strong> for a rally focused on reproductive freedom in Kalamazoo, Michigan (or as Obama called it, \u201cKamala-zoo\u201d). The former first lady and the vice-president emphasized the stakes for abortion and reproductive healthcare if Donald Trump is re-elected. Earlier in the day, Harris spoke with reproductive healthcare providers at a clinic in Portage, Michigan.</p></li> <li><p>On the first day of early voting in Michigan, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> also held a rally in Michigan. At an event in Novi, the ex-president was joined on stage by several imams and other leaders of the state\u2019s large Muslim and Arab American community, who denounced Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the war in Gaza.</p></li> <li><p>Later in the evening, Trump spoke at a second event in State College, Pennsylvania, where he again promised to ban sanctuary cities and launch a massive deportation program all while unleashing more personal attacks against Harris.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Elon Musk</strong>, who has become a vocal critic of \u201copen borders\u201d, worked illegally in the United States early in his career, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/26/elon-musk-immigration-status/\">the Washington Post reports</a>. After arriving in the United States for a graduate program at Stanford, Musk never attended classes and did not have work authorization when he started building the company that became Zip2.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Joe Biden</strong> campaigned for Harris across Pennsylvania today, speaking with the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America in Pittsburgh.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Nika Soon-Shiong</strong>, whose family owns the Los Angeles Times, says the paper\u2019s decision not to endorse a presidential candidate was made by her family due to Kamala Harris\u2019s position on the war in Gaza. Her father, Dr Patrick Soon-Shiong, who owns the paper, said his daughter was speaking in her personal capacity.</p></li> <li><p>Senator <strong>Bob Casey</strong> addressed members of the Carpenters Union in Philadelphia and attacked his Republican opponent, <strong>Dave McCormick</strong>, over allegations that he fostered a toxic work environment as CEO of the hedge fund Bridgewater, describing the claims as \u201cdisqualifying\u201d.</p></li> <li><p>Harris is expected to campaign across Philadelphia tomorrow while Trump gears up for a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York.</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-26T23:18:32.648Z\">at 12.18am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-671d75b08f08d3f94c2baa3b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/joan-greve\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-26T23:06:00.656Z\">12.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump ends his rally begging supporters to deliver a 'landslide'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Donald Trump concluded his roughly hour-long rally in State College, Pennsylvania, with a request for all of his supporters to go to the polls on 5 November.</strong> </p> <p>\u201cWith your vote this November, we\u2019re going to fire Kamala, and we are going to save America,\u201d Trump said.</p> <p>Again raising the specter of Democratic election meddling despite no evidence of such fraud in the 2020 presidential race, Trump implored his supporters to deliver a \u201clandslide\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe must defeat Kamala Harris and stop a radical left agenda with a landslide that is too big to rig,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe will never ever back down, and we will never surrender.\u201d</p> <p>Trump then walked off the stage with the sound of YMCA by the Village People playing in the background.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-26T23:08:19.975Z\">at 12.08am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-671d72fd8f08d3f94c2baa26\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/joan-greve\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-26T23:05:16.775Z\">12.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Donald Trump unleashed more personal attacks against <strong>Kamala Harris </strong>at his Pennsylvania rally, dismissing her as a \u201cradical left lunatic\u201d.</p> <p>He then gave a detailed account of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2024/oct/21/donald-trump-makes-fries-during-staged-campaign-event-at-mcdonalds-video\">photo opp</a> at McDonald\u2019s last week to recirculate baseless claims that Harris lied about working at the fast-food chain when she was in high school. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-26T23:08:31.753Z\">at 12.08am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-671d6ffc8f080a42be7575ee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/joan-greve\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-26T22:41:27.013Z\">11.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Donald Trump again promised to ban sanctuary cities and launch a massive deportation program if he wins the presidential race, making xenophobic comments about how US towns have been \u201cconquered\u201d by immigrants.</strong></p> <p>\u201cThese are dangerous people.

      "bodyText": "This blog is closing now \u2013 thanks for following along. You can read our US elections coverage here. Here are the major developments from today: Michelle Obama joined Kamala Harris for a rally focused on reproductive freedom in Kalamazoo, Michigan (or as Obama called it, \u201cKamala-zoo\u201d). The former first lady and the vice-president emphasized the stakes for abortion and reproductive healthcare if Donald Trump is re-elected. Earlier in the day, Harris spoke with reproductive healthcare providers at a clinic in Portage, Michigan. On the first day of early voting in Michigan, Donald Trump also held a rally in Michigan. At an event in Novi, the ex-president was joined on stage by several imams and other leaders of the state\u2019s large Muslim and Arab American community, who denounced Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the war in Gaza. Later in the evening, Trump spoke at a second event in State College, Pennsylvania, where he again promised to ban sanctuary cities and launch a massive deportation program all while unleashing more personal attacks against Harris. Elon Musk, who has become a vocal critic of \u201copen borders\u201d, worked illegally in the United States early in his career, the Washington Post reports. After arriving in the United States for a graduate program at Stanford, Musk never attended classes and did not have work authorization when he started building the company that became Zip2. Joe Biden campaigned for Harris across Pennsylvania today, speaking with the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America in Pittsburgh. Nika Soon-Shiong, whose family owns the Los Angeles Times, says the paper\u2019s decision not to endorse a presidential candidate was made by her family due to Kamala Harris\u2019s position on the war in Gaza. Her father, Dr Patrick Soon-Shiong, who owns the paper, said his daughter was speaking in her personal capacity. Senator Bob Casey addressed members of the Carpenters Union in Philadelphia and attacked his Republican opponent, Dave McCormick, over allegations that he fostered a toxic work environment as CEO of the hedge fund Bridgewater, describing the claims as \u201cdisqualifying\u201d. Harris is expected to campaign across Philadelphia tomorrow while Trump gears up for a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York. Donald Trump concluded his roughly hour-long rally in State College, Pennsylvania, with a request for all of his supporters to go to the polls on 5 November. \u201cWith your vote this November, we\u2019re going to fire Kamala, and we are going to save America,\u201d Trump said. Again raising the specter of Democratic election meddling despite no evidence of such fraud in the 2020 presidential race, Trump implored his supporters to deliver a \u201clandslide\u201d. \u201cWe must defeat Kamala Harris and stop a radical left agenda with a landslide that is too big to rig,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe will never ever back down, and we will never surrender.\u201d Trump then walked off the stage with the sound of YMCA by the Village People playing in the background. Donald Trump unleashed more personal attacks against Kamala Harris at his Pennsylvania rally, dismissing her as a \u201cradical left lunatic\u201d. He then gave a detailed account of his photo opp at McDonald\u2019s last week to recirculate baseless claims that Harris lied about working at the fast-food chain when she was in high school. Donald Trump again promised to ban sanctuary cities and launch a massive deportation program if he wins the presidential race, making xenophobic comments about how US towns have been \u201cconquered\u201d by immigrants. \u201cThese are dangerous people. These are really dangerous people,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you\u2019re going to do about it to make them less dangerous.\u201d A report compiled by the American Immigration Council estimated the annual cost of deporting one million immigrants per year to be roughly $88bn. Donald Trump briefly touched on his baseless claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election as he addressed supporters in State College, Pennsylvania. Trump noted that he won more votes in 2020 than any president in US history. That statement is true, but crucially, Trump\u2019s 74m votes fell short of Joe Biden\u2019s 81m votes in the 2020 race. Trump unsurprisingly sidestepped that fact in his remarks. \u201cI got the most votes in the history of our country for a sitting president. Can you imagine? But they say they beat us,\u201d Trump said. \u201c[Biden] got a few more votes \u2013 sitting in his basement, not talking \u2013 and it\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d Trump then repeated his boast that he would easily defeat Kamala Harris, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to pull this off. It\u2019ll be the greatest victory in the history of our country for all of us \u2013 not for me, for all of us.\u201d Donald Trump griped about Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign rally with Beyonc\u00e9 in Houston last night, mocking the event as a \u201cdisaster\u201d. Beyonc\u00e9 endorsed Harris at the rally, telling the 30,000 people assembled at Shell Energy stadium: \u201cFor all the men and women in this room, and watching around the country, we need you.\u201d Despite some speculation that Beyonc\u00e9 would perform, she did not, prompting ridicule from Trump. \u201cThe people went there because they thought they\u2019re going to hear Beyonc\u00e9 sing,\u201d Trump said at his rally in State College. \u201cThen she turned around [and] she left.\u201d Donald Trump should \u201cnever again\u201d serve as president of the United States, Kamala Harris says, evoking the ex-president\u2019s authoritarian tendencies. \u201cSomeone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States,\u201d Harris said, before leading the crowd in a chorus of \u201cnever again\u201d. \u201cTo love our country is to know that one of the highest forms of patriotism, I believe, is to then fight for the ideals of our country,\u201d she added. Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric against Kamala Harris has turned increasingly vitriolic in the final days of the presidential race, and he continued that trend at his rally in State College, Pennsylvania. Promising a \u201cnew golden age\u201d for the nation if he wins, Trump lambasted Harris and Joe Biden\u2019s leadership over the past four years. \u201cPennsylvania, you have to stand up and you have to tell Kamala that you\u2019ve had enough. You\u2019re not going to take it anymore. You\u2019re the worst vice-president,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou\u2019re just horrible, Kamala. You\u2019re fired. Get out of here.\u201d Echoing Michelle Obama, Kamala Harris is trying to draw a through-line between her ancestors in the civil rights movement, her work to preserve reproductive freedom and gen Z\u2019s advocacy around a host of issues. \u201cYou, who have only known the climate crisis, are leading the charge to protect our planet and our future. You, who grew up with active shooter drills, are fighting to keep our schools safe. You, who now know fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers, are standing up for reproductive freedom. And for you, all these issues are not, they\u2019re not political. They\u2019re your lived experience. And I want to tell you I see you, and I see your power,\u201d Harris said. Kamala Harris is lauding the Affordable Care Act and speaking about reproductive freedom at her Kalamazoo rally. \u201cI believe healthcare should be a right and not a privilege of those who have the money to afford it. On the other hand, we\u2019ve got Donald Trump, who intends to end the Affordable Care Act, or as we like to call it, Obamacare,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI did an event in Texas last night in Houston and if you saw it, you probably saw some of the stories about what has been happening in our country, the suffering,\u201d she added, refering to women and families who shared their stories of struggling to access medical care under abortion bans. Noting that Michigan has protected abortion access, Harris added, \u201cif there\u2019s a national abortion ban, nobody is safe.\u201d Arriving about an hour-and-a-half late, Donald Trump has taken the stage for his campaign rally in State College, Pennsylvania. In his typical boasting manner, Trump claimed he is \u201cleading in all the polls\u201d. even as surveys suggest the presidential race is a true toss-up with just 10 days left before election day. \u201cWe\u2019re leading, but we\u2019ve got to close it out,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOn November 5, America will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer and stronger than ever before.\u201d Senator Bob Casey attacked his Republican opponent, Dave McCormick, over allegations that he fostered a toxic work environment as CEO of the hedge fund Bridgewater, describing the claims as \u201cdisqualifying\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve always placed a priority on combating sexual harassment in the workplace, and apparently at Bridgewater, it was just a whole different story,\u201d Casey told reporters this morning. \u201cSo he\u2019s being held accountable for that, and he should be held accountable. I think that alone is disqualfiying. If you\u2019ve engaged in that kind of activity in the private sector, you should not be a public official at any level.\u201d The Casey campaign released an ad this week highlighting claims that McCormick attempted to silence or retaliate against female employees of Bridgewater who came forward with harassment claims. Casey\u2019s campaign manager also penned a letter calling on McCormick to demand that Bridgewater release employees who reported harassment from their non-disclosure agreements. \u201cIt is your responsibility to ensure the voters of Pennsylvania have complete information about your record before casting their votes,\u201d Tiernan Donohue, Casey\u2019s campaign manager, wrote in the letter. \u201cThey deserve the full story.\u201d Speaking to reporters after his event with the Carpenters Union, Senator Bob Casey said he believes the momentum and enthusiasm on the ground in Pennsylvania will lift Democrats to victory in 10 days. \u201cI think it is close. There\u2019s no question about that,\u201d Casey said. \u201cThat energy and intensity on the ground is starting to uplift our side. I\u2019ve never seen the number of volunteers that we\u2019ve seen in this state. Every weekend they\u2019re breaking another record.\u201d Asked specifically about whether young voters will turn out to vote for him and Kamala Harris, Casey expressed confidence that they would. \u201cI think the turnout is going to be high,\u201d Casey said. \u201cYoung voters might engage a little late, but I think they\u2019re ready to vote.\u201d Kamala Harris is drawing out the personal and political differences between her and Donald Trump. \u201cI grew up in a middle class neighborhood with a working mother who kept a strict budget and did everything she could to make sure my sister and I had all that we needed. I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from,\u201d Harris said. Trump\u2019s \u201cagenda is all laid out in Project 2025, which I still must say, I cannot believe they put that in writing,\u201d she added, before going on to talk about her plan for a child tax credit and to lower housing and healthcare costs. Senator Bob Casey addressed members of the Carpenters Union in Philadelphia this morning, as the three-term Democrat enters the final 10 days of his race against Republican Dave McCormick. Casey, whose race has grown increasingly close in recent weeks, again criticized McCormick over his leadership of the hedge fund Bridgewater and his recent residency in Connecticut. \u201cHe was investing in Chinese oil companies, investing in Chinese steel companies and betting against US Steel \u2013 hurting our workers, hurting our companies. That is his record as a hedge fund CEO,\u201d Casey said. \u201cI\u2019ll put my record \u2013 fighting for families in this state, investing in communities in this state and fighting for working men and women \u2013 I\u2019ll put that record up against his record any day of the week.\u201d Thanking the union for its support throughout his political career, Casey added, \u201cI\u2019m going to work night and day for the next 10 days, like I\u2019ve been working my whole life, to earn your votes and to earn your trust.\u201d Protesters demonstrating against the war in Gaza briefly interrupted Kamala Harris\u2019s rally in Kalamazoo. The crowd chanted over the protesters before Harris continued, \u201cAnd listen on the topic of Gaza, we must end that war, and we must end the war and bring the hostages home, but now I am speaking about 2024.\u201d Michelle Obama has welcomed Kamala Harris to the stage in Kalamazoo. \u201cThe stakes are high, because, as [Michelle Obama] reminds us, as my mother taught me, don\u2019t just complain about injustice, do something,\u201d Harris said. Michelle Obama says Kamala Harris will defend reproductive freedom \u201cnot because she\u2019s a woman, but because she\u2019s a decent human being.\u201d \u201cShe will usher in a new generation of American leadership and send the ugliness of Donald Trump and his politics, back where it belongs. The past,\u201d Obama said, before encouraging the crowd in Kalamazoo to \u201cdo something\u201d and talk to their family and community about voting. Michelle Obama is painting a picture of what restricted reproductive health care could look like across the United States if Donald Trump is re-elected. \u201cWe will see more doctors hesitating or shying away from providing life saving treatments because they are worried about being arrested. More medical students reconsidering even pursuing women\u2019s health at all. More OB-GYN clinics without enough doctors to meet demand, closing their doors, leaving untold numbers of women in communities throughout this country without a place to go for basic gynecological care, which in turn, will leave millions of us at risk of undiagnosed medical issues like cervical and uterine cancers,\u201d Obama said. \u201cTo the men who love us, let me just try to paint a picture of what it will feel like if America, the wealthiest nation on Earth, keeps revoking the basic care from its women, and how it will affect every single woman in your life,\u201d she continued. \u201cI am asking y\u2019all, from the core of my being, to take our lives seriously,\u201d she said. \u201cDo not put our lives in the hands of politicians, mostly men, who have no clue or do not care about what we as women are going through.\u201d Michelle Obama is asking the crowd at Kamala Harris\u2019s rally in Kalamazoo to consider which presidential candidate they think will look out for their civil and reproductive rights. \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever been out there marching and weeping for justice, who do you think is going to have your back? Is it Donald Trump, who once took out a full-page ad to demonize innocent young Black teenagers in New York City, who has dreamed openly about his own version of a purge, where, in his words, he has said for one day, one real rough, nasty day, he says he will allow cops to use violence indiscriminately?\u201d Obama said. \u201cThere\u2019s more at stake than just protecting a woman\u2019s choice to give birth, and sadly, we as women and girls have not been socialized to talk openly about our reproductive health. We\u2019ve been taught instead to feel shame and to hide how our bodies work,\u201d she added, describing the stigma many women feel discussing everything from menstruation to menopause. \u201cAnd look, I don\u2019t expect any man to fully grasp how vulnerable this makes us feel, to understand the complexities of our reproductive health experiences. In all honesty, most of us as women don\u2019t fully understand the breadth and depth of our own reproductive lives,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge disparity in research funding for women\u2019s health, and if you happen to look like me and report pain, you\u2019re more likely to be ignored even by your own doctors,\u201d she added, to a chorus of agreement. \u201cIf we keep dismantling parts of our reproductive care system piece by piece, as Trump intends to do, I want folks to understand the chilling effect, not just on critical abortion care, but on the entirety of women\u2019s health.\u201d Still speaking in Kalamazoo, Michelle Obama has criticized Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic and January 6 attack. \u201cWhen the American people fired him from a job that was too big for him to begin with, he tried to steal it,\u201d Obama said. Referencing the growing list of former Trump administration officials who have noted the ex-president\u2019s authoritarian tendencies, Obama added, \u201cThese folks know that nothing this man says or does is funny in any way. So I hope you\u2019ll forgive me if I\u2019m a little frustrated that some of us are choosing to ignore Donald Trump\u2019s gross incompetence while asking Kamala to dazzle us at every turn.\u201d \u201cI hope that you will forgive me if I am worried that we will blow this opportunity to finally turn the page on the ugliness once and for all, because, believe me, if Donald Trump is president again at some point or another, that ugliness will touch all of our lives.\u201d In an interview with Meet the Press, JD Vance has tried to explain Donald Trump\u2019s comments on \u201cthe enemy from within. Vance told moderator Kristen Welker: \u201cI think what Donald Trump said is that those folks pose a greater threat to United States\u2019 peace and security because America is strong enough to stand up to any foreign adversary.\u201d The full interview will air tomorrow. Although she says she hates politics, Michelle Obama says the stakes of this election were too high for her to sit it out. \u201cI wanted to do everything in my power to remind the country that I love that there\u2019s too much we stand to lose if we get this one wrong,\u201d the former first lady said. Obama also called out the higher standards that Black women are held to as some have criticized Harris. \u201cThey accuse her of not providing enough policy detail. Some wonder, do we really know her? Is she too aggressive? Is she not aggressive enough? There are folks sowing seeds of doubt about whether she\u2019s who she appears to be,\u201d Obama said. \u201cNow, don\u2019t get me wrong, voters have every right to ask hard questions of any candidate seeking office, but can someone tell me why we are once again holding Kamala to a higher standard than her opponent?\u201d \u201cFor Trump, we expect nothing at all, no understanding of policy, no ability to put together a coherent argument, no honesty, no decency, no morals.\u201d Speaking at the Harris campaign\u2019s rally in Kalamazoo, Michelle Obama seeks to draw a stark comparison between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Kamala Harris is \u201cshowing us what a sane, stable leader looks like,\u201d the former first lady said. \u201cThat\u2019s because Kamala Harris is a grown-up. And Lord knows we need a grown-up in the White House.\u201d \u201cThis is someone who understands you, all of you, someone from a middle class family raised mostly by her mom, like so many of us, leaning on her neighbors, like we all do, that\u2019s what you want in a president,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWith all that being said, I got to ask myself, well, why on earth is this race even close?\u201d she added \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that the question isn\u2019t whether Kamala is ready for this moment, because by every measure, she has demonstrated that she\u2019s ready. The real question is, as a country, are we ready for this moment.\u201d Michelle Obama is speaking now at Kamala Harris\u2019 rally in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The former first lady, who was welcomed onstage to uproarious applause, called the city \u201cKamala-zoo\u201d. As Kamala Harris and Donald Trump prepare to make their closing arguments in the final week of the presidential election, the National Park Service has just approved a permit request for an estimated 20,000 people to attend Harris\u2019 Tuesday rally at The Ellipse. The park just south of the White House was where Trump rallied his supporters on January 6 before they stormed the Capitol. Nika Soon-Shiong, whose family owns the Los Angeles Times, says the paper\u2019s decision not to endorse a presidential candidate was made by her family due to Kamala Harris\u2019s position on the war in Gaza. \u201cAs a citizen of a country openly financing genocide, and as a family that experienced South African Apartheid, the endorsement was an opportunity to repudiate justifications for the widespread targeting of journalists and ongoing war on children,\u201d Soon-Shiong said in a statement to the New York Times. On X, she elaborated in a post: \u201cFor my family, Apartheid is not a vague concept. My father was an emergency surgeon at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto. He treated students shot by the police during the Soweto Uprisings \u2013 where 176 died protesting the brutal system of racial segregation.\u201d Her father, Dr Patrick Soon-Shiong, who owns the paper, said his daughter was speaking in her personal capacity. Mariel Garza, who resigned from the paper on Tuesday following the announcement that it would not endorse a candidate, said that explanation had not been communicated to the editorial board. \u201cIf the family\u2019s goal was to \u2018repudiate justifications for the widespread targeting of journalists and ongoing war on children,\u2019 remaining silent did not accomplish that,\u201d Garza said. Harris will speak at another packed rally, this time at an event center in Kalamazoo, where the local ice hockey team plays. The Saturday afternoon event featuring Michelle Obama is drawing thousands of people, many of them women sporting all kinds of Harris\u2019s merchandise that, like the campaign, has grown ever more targeted in the final days of the election. A group of women wore shirts emblazoned with \u201cKamalazoo\u201d \u2013 a play on the name of the host city. Others were more blunt: \u201cFeminists vs Fascists\u201d was printed across one woman\u2019s sweatshirt. Pink pussy hats came out of the closet, and pearl necklaces were the accessory du jour. Cousins Teressa Randle and Kisha McAllister of Kalamazoo said they were ecstatic to have the vice-president visit. \u201cIt\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see the first woman, first Black woman and first south Asian woman president,\u201d Randle said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stay home.\u201d Both women had already cast their ballots and said they could not understand anyone who had not yet made up their minds. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been paying attention to anything that\u2019s happened over the last eight years, it should not be a question,\u201d Randle said. Outside the Harris event, pro-Palestinian activists protested the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s policy toward Israel. Waving Palestinian flags and holding signs that read \u201cnot another bomb\u201d, they called on Harris to support an arms embargo. The protesters stood in line, linked by a chain of baby clothes that they said represents the thousands of Palestinian and Lebanese children who have been killed by Israeli airstrikes over the course of the yearlong war. Michigan is home to a sizeable population of Arab and Muslim voters furious over the president\u2019s handling of the war. Many say they will skip the election or vote for the Green party candidate, Jill Stein, as a way of expressing their discontent that Harris has refused to meaningfully separate herself from Biden. Polls show the race in Michigan deadlocked, suggesting that even the smallest defections could swing the result. Kamala Harris visited with reproductive healthcare providers and medical students in Portage, Michigan, en route to her rally in Kalamazoo this evening. Harris spoke with six female providers at the offices of Dr Rockelle Rogers and Dr Amanda Henry, according to White House pool reports. \u201cWe represent not only a safety net for our region here in the Midwest, but over the last 18 months, we\u2019ve seen an influx of patients that are coming, particularly from the south,\u201d one of the doctors told Harris. Asked how abortion bans are affecting where they decide to practice medicine, one medical student told the vice-president: \u201cI think as medical students, we kind of found ourselves in this sort of limbo. You know, we put all this hard work and time into doing what we want to but we\u2019re supposed to be excited about that, but there is this decision to make on November 5 that has this chance to monumentally impact our careers before they even start.\u201d Ahead of Harris\u2019s event in Kalamazoo, Liz Morley of Oxford, Michigan, sells homemade pearl necklaces with a Chuck Taylor \u2013 two of the vice-president\u2019s favorite accessories. In the battleground state, where the election has divided neighborhoods and families, Morley said she\u2019s found that some Harris voters prefer more subtle displays of support. \u201cA lot of people are afraid to put lawn signs out and bumper stickers, and they feel better putting something on their person,\u201d Morley said. Even in her own town, loyalties were split \u201c50-50\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s like every other house,\u201d she said. Both Harris and Trump will be in the state today, one of their many stops in an effort to claim Michigan\u2019s (potentially decisive) 15 electoral votes. Morley began making the necklaces in August after Harris ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket. Competing with vendors selling Harris T-shirts and hats, Morley said her wares stood apart. Plus, at $10 a necklace, buying one was more affordable than buying a new pair of Converse or strand of pearls, she said with a smile. In response to our reporting earlier this week, former model Stacey Williams says she has been attacked by Donald Trump\u2019s online supporters. On Wednesday, the Guardian exclusively reported that Williams, who says she met Donald Trump through the late sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein, has accused the former president of groping and sexually touching her in an incident in Trump Tower in 1993. \u201cTrump and his angry, divisive followers have attacked Stacey with the usual playbook of insults and lies,\u201d said Mariann Wang of Wang Hecker, a representative of Stacey Williams. \u201cAs Stacey has courageously reported, Trump groped her breasts and entire body in front of his good friend Jeffrey Epstein as part of some kind of twisted game. Stacey was just 24 and Trump was almost twice her age. Stacey\u2019s report is supported by the evidence, including a polygraph finding, Trump\u2019s own handwriting on a postcard he sent her, and multiple witnesses she reported to over the years. Trump wants you to ignore Stacey \u2013 the most recent of dozens of women who have come forward to describe his assaults \u2013 and sweep all these women under the rug. Trump and his friend Epstein are one of a kind \u2013 men who believe their wealth and fame gives them power over young women and their bodies.\u201d Tim Walz will play Madden NFL on Twitch with New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tomorrow. Earlier this month, the Harris-Walz campaign livestreamed one of Walz\u2019s rallies during a World of Warcraft stream. Ocasio-Cortez has previously made news for her video game streams, which she\u2019s used to engage with young male voters. Moments ago, Harris took a handful of questions from reporters on the tarmac in Michigan about the situation in the Middle East. She said she had a \u201clengthy and important\u201d conversation with Biden and members of the national security team earlier on Saturday, following Israel\u2019s pre-dawn strikes on Iran. \u201cWe maintain the importance of supporting Israel\u2019s right to defend itself,\u201d the vice president said. \u201cAnd we are also very adamant that we must see de-escalation in the region going forward and that will be our focus.\u201d Underscoring her dual roles as vice president and candidate, Harris was briefed on the situation before stepping on the stage in Houston for a rally with Beyonc\u00e9 on Friday night. \u201cThis war must end. We must get the hostages out and work toward a two-state solution,\u201d Harris told reporters. Asked about the views of the US\u2019s Arab allies, Harris said there was a \u201cconsensus among leaders in the region, and certainly it is the strong perspective of the United States that there must be the de-escalation and not an escalation.\u201d She stressed the US would always defend Israel against an attack by Iran. Donald Trump has been joined on stage by Bill Bazzi, the current and first Muslim mayor of Dearborn Heights, at his rally in Novi, Michigan. \u201cI have never seen the devastation that we\u2019re seeing right now,\u201d Bazzi said. \u201cWhen President Trump was president, there was no wars.\u201d At his rally in Novi, Donald Trump was joined on stage by leaders of the state\u2019s Arab and Muslim communities. \u201cWe as Muslims stand with President Trump because he promises peace. He promises peace, not war. We are supporting Donald Trump because he promised to end war in the Middle East and Ukraine,\u201d one member of the coalition said. \u201cWe support Donald J Trump for his commitment to promoting family values and protected our children well-being, especially when it comes to curriculums and schools.\u201d Speaking to Michigan\u2019s large Muslim community, which has expressed marked dissatisfaction with Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the war in Gaza, Trump decried Harris for campaigning alongside former Republican senator Liz Cheney. \u201cKamala is campaigning with Muslim-hating warmonger Liz Cheney, who wants to invade practically every Muslim country on the planet,\u201d Trump said, implying that the October 7 attack in Israel wouldn\u2019t have happened if he\u2019d been president. Adding that he\u2019d met with a coalition of local imams earlier in the day, Trump said that his campaign is \u201cwinning overwhelming support from the Muslim and Arab voters here in Michigan\u201d. With just over a week left until election day, our latest polling shows that Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are locked in a nail-bitingly close race. Here\u2019s Robert Tait with more analysis: The Guardian\u2019s 10-day polling tracking average shows Harris, the Democratic nominee and US vice-president, maintaining the single-point advantage over her Republican rival she had a week earlier, 47% to 46%. Surveys for the seven battleground states are equally cliffhanging and provide little obvious clue as to who will reach the threshold of 270 electoral votes essential for victory. According to poll averages, Harris leads by a single point in Michigan and by less than 1% in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin and Nevada. Trump has a two-point lead in North Carolina and a one-point lead in Arizona. Joe Biden is campaigning for Kamala Harris today at a voter turnout event with the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America in Pennsylvania. \u201cThe choice couldn\u2019t be more stark,\u201d Biden said of the current election. \u201cThe only picket line Trump ever looks at is when he can cross, not walk, cross.\u201d Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t give a damn about union work. He views unions as getting in the way of the accumulation of wealth,\u201d he added. Liuna, which previously backed Biden, has endorsed Harris for president. Donald Trump is currently campaigning in Novi, Michigan \u2013 a Detroit suburb \u2013 while his rival, Kamala Harris, visits the Kalamazoo area. Trump kicked off his remarks by denouncing Harris\u2019 rally in Houston last night. \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 went up, spoke for a couple of minutes, and then left, and the place went crazy. They booed the hell out of everybody,\u201d Trump said. Harris\u2019 rally in Houston \u2013 where she spoke alongside Beyonc\u00e9 and various women and families impacted by Texas\u2019 abortion ban \u2013 was the campaign\u2019s largest to date, drawing 30,000 people. Our latest polling shows Harris is leading in Michigan by a narrow one-point margin. Kamala Harris will continue to highlight abortion access as she campaigns in Michigan on Saturday. Before rallying with Michelle Obama later this afternoon, Harris\u2019s campaign said the vice president will meet with healthcare providers and medical students at a doctor\u2019s office in Portage to make the case that their work could be threatened by a national abortion ban, even in a state where access is protected under the constitution. On Friday night, Harris held a rally in deeply conservative Texas to elevate the stories of residents who have been harmed by the state\u2019s harsh abortion ban. She made the case there that Trump should not be believed when he says he would not sign a federal ban. In her remarks, Harris name-checked battleground Michigan. Harris stopped in Portage earlier this year before Joe Biden stepped aside for a moderated conversation on reproductive rights with a Republican voter and a former Trump official who has endorsed her. In a social media post, Trump claimed abortion was losing salience, though polls show it remains one of voters top concerns. He repeated his preference that the matter be left to the states and that he supports exceptions for rape, incests and instances where the life of the mother is at risk. But Harris is arguing that this approach has created the current \u201chealthcare crisis\u201d in which women in red states are falling gravely ill and in some cases dying because they have been denied an abortion. Fueled by anger over the loss of abortion rights, women powered Democratic wins up and down the ballot in Michigan in the 2022 midterm elections. They also voted to enshrine abortion access into the state\u2019s constitution. Kamala Harris is expected to campaign across Philadelphia tomorrow while Donald Trump gears up for a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York. Harris is expected to focus her tour of Philadelphia on Sunday on the city\u2019s Black and Latino neighborhoods. She\u2019ll begin by attending service at a Black church in west Philadelphia before traveling to north Philadlphia to visit a local Puerto Rican restaurant. Meanwhile, Trump will be joined by the who\u2019s who of far-right political figures at his rally in New York. A lineup released by his campaign includes many of the ex-president\u2019s most loyal associates, such as Rudy Giuliani, Elon Musk, Stephen Miller, Tucker Carlson and Tulsi Gabbard. Over the course of a three-hour interview last night, Donald Trump told Joe Rogan about his plans to eliminate income taxes and appoint Robert F Kennedy Jr to tackle healthcare issues if he is elected president. He also shared that the biggest mistake he made during his presidency was hiring \u2018disloyal people\u2019. While discussing Trump\u2019s planned tariffs, Rogan asked Trump if he was open to replacing income taxes with tariffs. \u201cWell, OK,\u201d Trump said, adding: \u201cYeah, sure. Why not? Because, we, ready, our country was the richest in the, relatively, in the 1880s and 1890s. A president who was assassinated named McKinley \u2013 he was the tariff king. He spoke beautifully of tariffs. And then around in the early 1900s, they switched over stupidly to frankly an income tax.\u201d Trump also spoke about his relationship with Kennedy \u2013 whom he has not agreed with on every issue. Trump said he has told Kennedy: \u201cFocus on health, you can do whatever you want.\u201d The two have released an agenda titled \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d which focuses on processed foods and the pharmaceutical industry. Here\u2019s Edward Helmore with more on the interview: Trump used his interview with Rogan on Friday to repeat his claim that his defeat in the 2020 presidential election against Joe Biden was a \u201crigged\u201d outcome. But Trump changed the subject when Rogan asked him if he was ever going to release evidence proving the election was \u201cstolen\u201d. Beyonc\u00e9 lent her star power to Kamala Harris at a high-octane rally in Texas on Friday, declaring that the US was on the \u201cbrink of history\u201d as the vice-president warned that the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban could become the law of the land if Donald Trump were to be elected, the Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino reported from the event. In an apparent reaction to Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign rally in Houston \u2013 which 30,000 people attended, Donald Trump has posted on Truth Social, saying that \u201cAbortion has dropped way down as an issue\u201d. Here\u2019s a Harris campaign staffer sharing the ex-president\u2019s Truth Social post: And here\u2019s Lauren with more from Houston: With the presidential race effectively deadlocked, Harris detoured briefly from the seven battleground states to appear in deep-red Texas. Here in a place she called \u201cground zero for the fight for reproductive freedom\u201d, Harris sought to lay out the stakes in November for voters who have yet to make up their minds about the candidates \u2013 or whether to cast a ballot at all. Elon Musk, who has become a vocal critic of \u201copen borders\u201d, worked illegally in the United States early in his career, the Washington Post reports. After arriving in the United States for a graduate program at Stanford, Musk never attended classes and did not have work authorization when he started building the company that became Zip2. Here\u2019s the Washington Post: When the venture capital firm Mohr Davidow Ventures poured $3 million into Musk\u2019s company in 1996, the funding agreement \u2013 a copy of which was obtained by The Post \u2013 stated that the Musk brothers and an associate had 45 days to obtain legal work status. Otherwise, the firm could reclaim its investment. \u201cTheir immigration status was not what it should be for them to be legally employed running a company in the U.S.,\u201d said Derek Proudian, a Zip2 board member at the time who later became chief executive. Investors agreed, Proudian said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want our founder being deported.\u201d Good morning, with just over a week left before election day, the race is nail-bitingly close. We\u2019ll be bringing you the latest headlines and analysis today as the campaigns continue. This morning, we\u2019re expecting Donald Trump to deliver remarks at a rally in Novi, Michigan, before traveling to State College, Pennsylvania. His running mate, JD Vance, will similarly speak in Atlanta, Georgia, before heading to Erie, Pennsylvania. In her first event of the campaign, Michelle Obama will hold a get-out-the-vote rally alongside Kamala Harris in Kalamazoo, Michigan. M, Tim Walz will travel to Phoenix and Window Rock, Arizona \u2013 the capital of the Navajo Nation. In Houston yesterday, Kamala Harris was joined on stage by superstar singer Beyonc\u00e9, congressman Colin Allred, musician Willie Nelson, actor Jessica Alba, several Texas-based OB-GYNs and families affected by the state\u2019s abortion ban in what her campaign is calling their largest rally to date. Harris focused her remarks on the state\u2019s abortion ban, which sparked a slew of abortion restrictions nationwide. Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Traverse City, Michigan, was delayed several hours last night after the ex-president\u2019s interview with podcast host Joe Rogan lasted three hours. Harris and Trump are tied at 48% each for the popular vote for the US presidential election, according to the final New York Times/Siena College national poll published on today. The Washington Post declined to endorse a presidential candidate for the first time since the 1980s. Some staffers and reporters have said the decision was allegedly made by the Post\u2019s owner, billionaire Jeff Bezos.",

In Prince William: We Can End Homelessness, viewers hear a recording of LBC radio host James O\u2019Brien citing criticism from Graham Smith, the chief executive of Republic, the anti-monarchist group, who says homelessness is about government policy and investment, and won\u2019t be stopped by charity or royal patronage.

But as he began to reach out to social workers and other witnesses, Blaine knew there was another source he needed to hear from: Michael Shelley.</p> <p>\u201cI lived in absolute fear of him,\u201d Blaine says. Nevertheless, he sent him an email. \u201cI actually still can\u2019t believe that I really did it.\u201d</p> <p>Michael responded to Blaine\u2019s first tentative email and was soon sharing his own personal archive of over 400,000 words of material including unpublished autobiographical accounts, reports and sermons. Even from someone Blaine knew was an \u201cincredibly unreliable narrator\u201d, it created a vivid picture.</p> <p>Blaine\u2019s siblings were burnt-out from years of Michael\u2019s fiery attempts to reconnect \u2013 often by accusing his children of being a \u201cTRAITOR\u201d, \u201cbrainwashed\u201d by authorities and the Blaines. But Lech Blaine\u2019s correspondence struck a different tone to the harassing messages his family had received for years.</p> <p>\u201cIt was pretty civil,\u201d Blaine recalls. \u201cOccasionally he would go on some rants, but he never really got vicious with me. I think that he was more angry at my foster siblings because they weren\u2019t paying him any attention or trying to get in contact.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a guy who had spent decades desperately trying to get people to read his writing and to ask him what he thinks about things. I was really one of the only people who\u2019ve ever actually showed much interest in what he had to say.\u201d</p>    <p>Shelley\u2019s own voluminous writings filled in the gaps in the public record, his mother\u2019s records and Blaine\u2019s own childhood memories.</p> <p>\u201cI got a much better sense of who they were before they\u2019d suffered nervous breakdowns, and I got a genuine sense that they weren\u2019t <em>evil</em>. They weren\u2019t irredeemably awful. From their birth they were rich, complex people who had quite serious, especially in Mary\u2019s case, quite serious mental health issues.\u201d</p> <p>In a previous life, the Shelleys had been charismatic, privileged Sydney socialites whose relationships and exploits had garnered magazine front pages and newspaper column inches.</p> <p>The Shelleys found each other in the wake of breakups and breakdowns, beginning a decades-long co-dependency that saw them drop out of mainstream Australia for good, no matter the cost.</p> <p>As the book took shape, Blaine was also committed to recognising how his own parents\u2019 complexities shaped their family experience. He could see how his \u201clarrikin\u201d Dad\u2019s sense of humour was a \u201ccoping mechanism for some of the things that he suffered when he was quite young\u201d. He understood how his mother was an excellent foster carer because she was nonjudgemental, \u201cshe didn\u2019t radiate any sense of superiority to children\u201d.</p> <p>Lenore and Tom Blaine, and Michael and Mary Shelley all passed away years ago and as Lech Blaine worked on the book, his siblings wanted the same treatment in the book as their elders: to be seen as complex, not caricature.</p>    <p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t expecting me to paint like a rose-coloured portrait of them,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Blaine did not want, either, to paint a rose-coloured portrait of hope in modern Australia. Through tracking the lives of his siblings and their siblings, Blaine shows that whether someone\u2019s life becomes an Australian dream or nightmare can hinge on an opaque mix of nature, nurture, systematic factors beyond most people\u2019s control and sheer luck. </p>    <p>The final result, Australian Gospel, is a big-hearted epic, where the pangs of terror are never far from the next belly laugh.</p> <p>To understand the story from his siblings\u2019 perspective, Blaine called them every few nights, talking for over an hour at a time. \u201cThat went on for years,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it just created a real intimacy.\u201d</p> <p>As children, the Shelleys had threatened to tear the Blaine family apart. As adults, piecing together their story helped bring them even closer.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.blackincbooks.com.au/books/australian-gospel\">Australian Gospel: A Family Saga</a> by Lech Blaine is out on 5 November through Black Inc Books</p></li> </ul>",

But as he began to reach out to social workers and other witnesses, Blaine knew there was another source he needed to hear from: Michael Shelley. \u201cI lived in absolute fear of him,\u201d Blaine says. Nevertheless, he sent him an email. \u201cI actually still can\u2019t believe that I really did it.\u201d Michael responded to Blaine\u2019s first tentative email and was soon sharing his own personal archive of over 400,000 words of material including unpublished autobiographical accounts, reports and sermons. Even from someone Blaine knew was an \u201cincredibly unreliable narrator\u201d, it created a vivid picture. Blaine\u2019s siblings were burnt-out from years of Michael\u2019s fiery attempts to reconnect \u2013 often by accusing his children of being a \u201cTRAITOR\u201d, \u201cbrainwashed\u201d by authorities and the Blaines. But Lech Blaine\u2019s correspondence struck a different tone to the harassing messages his family had received for years. \u201cIt was pretty civil,\u201d Blaine recalls. \u201cOccasionally he would go on some rants, but he never really got vicious with me. I think that he was more angry at my foster siblings because they weren\u2019t paying him any attention or trying to get in contact. \u201cThis is a guy who had spent decades desperately trying to get people to read his writing and to ask him what he thinks about things. I was really one of the only people who\u2019ve ever actually showed much interest in what he had to say.\u201d Shelley\u2019s own voluminous writings filled in the gaps in the public record, his mother\u2019s records and Blaine\u2019s own childhood memories. \u201cI got a much better sense of who they were before they\u2019d suffered nervous breakdowns, and I got a genuine sense that they weren\u2019t evil. They weren\u2019t irredeemably awful. From their birth they were rich, complex people who had quite serious, especially in Mary\u2019s case, quite serious mental health issues.\u201d In a previous life, the Shelleys had been charismatic, privileged Sydney socialites whose relationships and exploits had garnered magazine front pages and newspaper column inches. The Shelleys found each other in the wake of breakups and breakdowns, beginning a decades-long co-dependency that saw them drop out of mainstream Australia for good, no matter the cost. As the book took shape, Blaine was also committed to recognising how his own parents\u2019 complexities shaped their family experience. He could see how his \u201clarrikin\u201d Dad\u2019s sense of humour was a \u201ccoping mechanism for some of the things that he suffered when he was quite young\u201d. He understood how his mother was an excellent foster carer because she was nonjudgemental, \u201cshe didn\u2019t radiate any sense of superiority to children\u201d. Lenore and Tom Blaine, and Michael and Mary Shelley all passed away years ago and as Lech Blaine worked on the book, his siblings wanted the same treatment in the book as their elders: to be seen as complex, not caricature. \u201cThey weren\u2019t expecting me to paint like a rose-coloured portrait of them,\u201d he says. Blaine did not want, either, to paint a rose-coloured portrait of hope in modern Australia. Through tracking the lives of his siblings and their siblings, Blaine shows that whether someone\u2019s life becomes an Australian dream or nightmare can hinge on an opaque mix of nature, nurture, systematic factors beyond most people\u2019s control and sheer luck. The final result, Australian Gospel, is a big-hearted epic, where the pangs of terror are never far from the next belly laugh. To understand the story from his siblings\u2019 perspective, Blaine called them every few nights, talking for over an hour at a time. \u201cThat went on for years,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it just created a real intimacy.\u201d As children, the Shelleys had threatened to tear the Blaine family apart. As adults, piecing together their story helped bring them even closer. Australian Gospel: A Family Saga by Lech Blaine is out on 5 November through Black Inc Books",

      "body": "<p>Life in London has been mapped according to its health, wealth, land ownership, politics and transport at key points in its long history. But it is now hoped it can be charted in a way that tells a different story: the story of language itself.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ross-perlin\">Ross Perlin</a>, an academic who claimed a prestigious \u00a325,000 book prize last week, now hopes to start work on a mapping project with British researchers that would reveal the whereabouts of the speakers of the capital\u2019s most at-risk languages. The map, they believe, would be a first step to saving them.</p> <p>Perlin, a US linguist, has already worked with <a href=\"https://www.elalliance.org/\">New York\u2019s Endangered Language Association</a> (ELA), where he is co-director, to create a clear geographical picture of the huge variety of tongues spoken in New York\u2019s five boroughs. Crucially, though, the map also pinpoints the most isolated surviving language communities.</p> <p>\u201cIt is vital to protect and understand the diversity of languages spoken in a city because of the human knowledge and culture they hold,\u201d Perlin said, after receiving the British Academy prize for Global Understanding for his book <em>Language City: The Fight to Preserve Endangered Mother Tongues</em>. \u201cLondon may well now be second only to New York in the number of endangered languages spoken.\u201d</p> <p>He said such a map would be \u201cvery useful\u201d for London. \u201cI\u2019d like to see a map put together, using the same open-source methods we used in New York,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI would very much like to see this done, stand ready to help, and predict it would be very revealing and useful \u2026 [but] resources and personnel are still needed before anything can be promised or planned.\u201d</p> <p>The original project, thought to be the first of its kind in the world, and which can be seen on the <a href=\"https://www.elalliance.org/\">ELA website</a>, was created using information sent to academics and researchers working in the association\u2019s headquarters in the Flatiron district of Manhattan.</p> <p>So far, the group, which has a mission to document and support the linguistic range in cities classed as \u201chyperdiverse\u201d, has now mapped more than 700 language varieties in New York. </p>    <p>London, Perlin suspects, is influenced by similar economic pressures: \u201cAs in New York, some of the language diversity has now been pushed out by the high cost of housing, and this creates other pockets of small language groups in other parts of the country.</p> <p>\u201cIt can be harder for these groups in places where there is not the same recent experience of multiple language-speaking and this can lead to isolation. There needs to be a process of mediation and understanding.\u201d</p> <p>The threat to an endangered language can come from this sort of squeeze, but it is never something Perlin sees as a \u201cnatural death\u201d. Across the world, almost half of all languages are spoken by communities of less than 10,000, while hundreds have just 10 speakers or fewer.</p> <p>In London\u2019s boroughs, previous studies have shown the chances of coming across Polish are higher on the streets of Croydon, while you are more likely to overhear Punjabi in Ealing than you are in Camden, where French speakers are common. But now Perlin aims to dig down further to \u201cthe deepest levels of human diversity\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf you go to the Green Lanes area in north London, as I did recently, you will hear many different Turkic languages spoken, but you will also hear Kurdish, Cypriot, Bulgarian and Italian language varieties,\u201d said Perlin.</p> <p>In a big city, the makeup of the population is shaped by war, poverty and trade, and in London the colonial past also still leaves its tracks. The tradition of Nepalese men joining the Gurkha regiments of the British army has, for instance, attracted a stream of immigrants, particularly from certain Nepali language groups, including speakers of endangered Seke.</p> <p>\u201cThese links and histories create the language vectors in a city,\u201d said Perlin. \u201cThere\u2019s always a logic behind the movement of a small language group. Ideally, each should be celebrated, just as the real estate market sometimes celebrates the diversity of food and culture.\u201d</p> <p>Perlin\u2019s book makes the point that speaking multiple languages, rather than one, is more common historically and that most human languages have been oral, rather than written.</p> <p>The emergence of a dominant language can be useful as a common currency for communication, he says, but it should not have greater status.

      "bodyText": "Life in London has been mapped according to its health, wealth, land ownership, politics and transport at key points in its long history. But it is now hoped it can be charted in a way that tells a different story: the story of language itself. Ross Perlin, an academic who claimed a prestigious \u00a325,000 book prize last week, now hopes to start work on a mapping project with British researchers that would reveal the whereabouts of the speakers of the capital\u2019s most at-risk languages. The map, they believe, would be a first step to saving them. Perlin, a US linguist, has already worked with New York\u2019s Endangered Language Association (ELA), where he is co-director, to create a clear geographical picture of the huge variety of tongues spoken in New York\u2019s five boroughs. Crucially, though, the map also pinpoints the most isolated surviving language communities. \u201cIt is vital to protect and understand the diversity of languages spoken in a city because of the human knowledge and culture they hold,\u201d Perlin said, after receiving the British Academy prize for Global Understanding for his book Language City: The Fight to Preserve Endangered Mother Tongues. \u201cLondon may well now be second only to New York in the number of endangered languages spoken.\u201d He said such a map would be \u201cvery useful\u201d for London. \u201cI\u2019d like to see a map put together, using the same open-source methods we used in New York,\u201d he said. \u201cI would very much like to see this done, stand ready to help, and predict it would be very revealing and useful \u2026 [but] resources and personnel are still needed before anything can be promised or planned.\u201d The original project, thought to be the first of its kind in the world, and which can be seen on the ELA website, was created using information sent to academics and researchers working in the association\u2019s headquarters in the Flatiron district of Manhattan. So far, the group, which has a mission to document and support the linguistic range in cities classed as \u201chyperdiverse\u201d, has now mapped more than 700 language varieties in New York. London, Perlin suspects, is influenced by similar economic pressures: \u201cAs in New York, some of the language diversity has now been pushed out by the high cost of housing, and this creates other pockets of small language groups in other parts of the country. \u201cIt can be harder for these groups in places where there is not the same recent experience of multiple language-speaking and this can lead to isolation. There needs to be a process of mediation and understanding.\u201d The threat to an endangered language can come from this sort of squeeze, but it is never something Perlin sees as a \u201cnatural death\u201d. Across the world, almost half of all languages are spoken by communities of less than 10,000, while hundreds have just 10 speakers or fewer. In London\u2019s boroughs, previous studies have shown the chances of coming across Polish are higher on the streets of Croydon, while you are more likely to overhear Punjabi in Ealing than you are in Camden, where French speakers are common. But now Perlin aims to dig down further to \u201cthe deepest levels of human diversity\u201d. \u201cIf you go to the Green Lanes area in north London, as I did recently, you will hear many different Turkic languages spoken, but you will also hear Kurdish, Cypriot, Bulgarian and Italian language varieties,\u201d said Perlin. In a big city, the makeup of the population is shaped by war, poverty and trade, and in London the colonial past also still leaves its tracks. The tradition of Nepalese men joining the Gurkha regiments of the British army has, for instance, attracted a stream of immigrants, particularly from certain Nepali language groups, including speakers of endangered Seke. \u201cThese links and histories create the language vectors in a city,\u201d said Perlin. \u201cThere\u2019s always a logic behind the movement of a small language group. Ideally, each should be celebrated, just as the real estate market sometimes celebrates the diversity of food and culture.\u201d Perlin\u2019s book makes the point that speaking multiple languages, rather than one, is more common historically and that most human languages have been oral, rather than written. The emergence of a dominant language can be useful as a common currency for communication, he says, but it should not have greater status. The linguist\u2019s joke about the distinction between a language and a dialect is that a language is just a dialect which has an army and a navy. While many smaller language groups are in London to do manual labour, and so are vulnerable to discrimination when they are not understood, there are also tiny language groups within wealthy populations. Diplomats and rich expats make up other distinct clusters. Perlin is now intrigued by the impact of religion and evangelism on the spread and decline of languages. While Christian missionary work helped spread dominant western languages, the missionaries themselves often studied local languages and dialects, recording them for the first time. Fittingly, his next book will be an examination of the phenomenon of the most translated film of all time, Jesus (also known as The Jesus Film). Made in 1979 in America, it has been made available in more than 2,100 languages and is due to be remade as an animation. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 October 2024.

      "body": "<p>I thought it was stupendous, giving birth. I felt like an Amazon, pushing out those wonder-children \u2013 long and hefty, smooth pudgy skin, so tender under my hand. It was a miracle of world-making to see a whole human unfurl from my womb. But this other shocking reality: torn flesh, lumpy stitches, burning urine, painful pooing. A visceral damage \u2013 but one I thought would be short-lived.</p> <p>When I had my two children over 30 years ago, I was a fan of the policy of the public hospital birthing centre: 24-hours-then-home-you-go. I thought I only needed an overnight or two in hospital before I whizzed home with our newborn. I didn\u2019t see any sense in medicalising birth. It was, after all, a natural process. There was little awareness of or planning for the time a body needed for healing and repair. </p> <p>I thought, if I can do this, I can do anything. When we arrived home with our firstborn, I refused to cancel the dinner with friends who were coming to stay the night. Yes, I said, it was a straightforward birth and how lucky am I? Of course I\u2019m fine; no issues. I didn\u2019t know what damage would come later.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know how much rest a birthing body needs. I didn\u2019t know the elders understood this, that lying-in is a tradition for a reason. I thought offers of help were outmoded notions of old-fashioned womanhood. I didn\u2019t know that lying down and staying home would have let my body knit itself back together just a little bit more. That there\u2019s a humility in resting \u2013 the humility of finitude.</p> <p>***</p> <p>In the last 30 years I have seen physiotherapists who specialise in women\u2019s health. In my case, this is a euphemism for pelvic floor health. And pelvic floor health is a euphemism for collapsing muscles and sagging organs \u2013 in turn euphemisms for the control I did not know I was giving up when I had those babies.</p> <p>By the time I reach my 40s, comedian Judith Lucy says it for me \u2013 \u201cYour pelvic floor is fucked? Get it carpeted!\u201d</p> <p>I asked a midwife once why she thought labour was so intense and painful. She looked at me unblinkingly and said, \u201cIt\u2019s to prepare you for what\u2019s ahead.\u201d</p> <p>In my 50s, 20 years after those babies, and after years of Pilates and physiotherapy, I have surgery. My prolapsed vaginal walls are lined with mesh, tightened and tucked. When the surgeon shows me a sample of the mesh, I look away. Who wants a kind of flywire embedded in their vaginal walls? It turns out I am one of the lucky ones. Many women have significant pain with this mesh \u2013 there are court cases and class actions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I formed a belief that the failure to securely hold parts of my body was a personal shortcoming</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The surgeon is a good technician, a bad communicator. If a patient rings his rooms, the snippy receptionists cut them short. So, my women\u2019s health physiotherapist is my guide in preparation and follow-up to surgery. This physiotherapist has been an early leader in the field of pelvic floor recovery, and my questions make sense to her. I secretly dub her my Cheerful Coach: she is as colourful as a rainbow lorikeet.</p> <p>During the surgery, in addition to the mesh work, a sling is inserted to stop my uterus from collapsing into my vagina. The surgeon has also recommended a hysterectomy but a conversation with my GP changes my mind.</p> <p>I ask: \u201cHow will they extract my uterus if they\u2019re doing keyhole surgery?\u201d</p> <p>She says: \u201cThey will mince it up inside you and extract it piece by piece.\u201d</p> <p>I decide I will not do this. No, I say, don\u2019t take her. Support her.</p> <p>So they put in the sling. I imagine it as a kind of hammock where my uterus can put her feet up and relax after all the work of month-by-month readiness, and child holding, and the fearsome effort of expelling the baby from its inside swimming pool. But why do I wait until my 50s to give her time to put her feet up?</p>    <p>When I ask Cheerful Coach how to describe the surgical intervention, she calls it \u201cpelvic reconstruction\u201d \u2013 right off the bat. This feels a lot better than the misery embodied in the word prolapse and the thought of embedded flywire. Prolapse has always invoked a sense of failure, as if I have somehow collapsed and not managed to keep myself intact.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/02/french-mothers-bladder-incontinence-nadia-sawalha\">French mothers don\u2019t suffer from bladder incontinence. And nor should you | Gillian Harvey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On my physiotherapist\u2019s watch I take six weeks bed rest post-surgery. No lifting, no weight-bearing, nothing heavier than a kettle of water. The rest makes sense; it gives the best chance for healing. And after secretly dreading its enforcement, I relish it. Who knew there was so much space in a day, that you could watch the shifting of the light, the movement of leaves, the pedestrian life in the street? Who knew that you could imbibe deep tranches of sleep, long spells of silence, inhabit other worlds narrated on audiobooks?</p> <p>Rest works. It doesn\u2019t heal everything but it helps. I wish I\u2019d known that when I had my babies. For me, the compulsion to keep going compromised the chance of ever really recovering from giving birth. I wish there\u2019d been a shape of living that made it possible to honour the work of birthing. It took me too long to unpick the narrative of being constantly time-poor and living life at speed, to pause as opposed to collapsing with exhaustion.</p> <p>There is no relapse, no further prolapse; it seems my private parts have now restored themselves. I am grateful for skilled surgery and proud of my recovery. I return to Pilates, attending weekly classes that build my core strength and help me integrate new awarenesses of posture and breath. And all these things help.</p> <p>Then comes that obstacle \u2013 a weakening for which it feels there is no help.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Because now, in my 60s, this new problem. My faeces leak. Never large amounts, just teasers. Sometimes a lurking smear, sometimes like small pebbles. This will happen when I least expect it to. There\u2019s no warning, no urgency, no pressure. I have a bowel motion, I think it is finished, I go on with my life and move about.</p> <p>But my body has not finished.</p> <p>The leakages become more frequent \u2013 every week or two instead of months apart. My physiotherapist offers ways to manage this. I wear the disposable liners used for menstruation, but I\u2019m terrified I will smell. I ask my GP if she has managed people with faecal incontinence. The GP shakes her head. I drop my gaze. I do not like feeling exceptional \u2013 not like this.</p> <p>I ask Cheerful Coach about shame. Why does this feel so mortifying? More than once, throughout the years, health professionals have seen that I was blaming myself for my body\u2019s apparent failures. \u201cThis is not your fault,\u201d they\u2019d said. But while I\u2019d heard them and sensed their compassion, that default setting had a tidal pull.</p> <p>Cheerful Coach explains: \u201cWhen we lived in caves, if you were incontinent, the wild animals could smell you. You were a danger to the tribe.\u201d</p> <p>A sense of relief: this shame belongs in the reptilian part of the brain.</p>    <p>Through a mutual friend, I meet a woman who has experienced far more dire episodes than my small embarrassments. She tells me the worst. While travelling in Europe in an ancient town, she could not find a toilet. In the end, on her way to the tiny bathroom at the back of a public bar, she lost an entire bowel motion. She describes it as the most abject experience of her life.</p> <p>We talk about fear and our forebears and what happened to their bodies. I wonder whether my problem will grow worse \u2013 what will become of me.</p> <p>And none of my friends talk about faecal incontinence. It\u2019s the last bastion, the last boundary of body-shaming. The only place I ever hear faecal incontinence referred to is in relation to aged care, where it\u2019s spoken of with the nose wrinkled.</p> <p>Yet one in 25 women will experience it. That\u2019s 4% of us.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Is it a betrayal to speak the harsh truth that childbirth can cost a mother\u2019s body in ways that will never fully repair? To speak only of the wonderment of a new human?</p> <p>To tell, or not to tell? Is it a conspiracy of silence or a wise withholding?</p> <p>Which is why I deliberate for so long before I tell my daughter. Eventually I tell her exactly what is happening. She is considered. She is thoughtful. She asks excellent questions. I\u2019m relieved \u2013 for her and for myself. Because I had felt ashamed and thought she would feel ashamed of me. She is calm and respectful: \u201cCan you get some more help?\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>I see a colorectal specialist. Colon. Rectum. These words sound too much like what they are. Colon: so slippery, like a python, like raw sausages.

      "bodyText": "I thought it was stupendous, giving birth. I felt like an Amazon, pushing out those wonder-children \u2013 long and hefty, smooth pudgy skin, so tender under my hand. It was a miracle of world-making to see a whole human unfurl from my womb. But this other shocking reality: torn flesh, lumpy stitches, burning urine, painful pooing. A visceral damage \u2013 but one I thought would be short-lived. When I had my two children over 30 years ago, I was a fan of the policy of the public hospital birthing centre: 24-hours-then-home-you-go. I thought I only needed an overnight or two in hospital before I whizzed home with our newborn. I didn\u2019t see any sense in medicalising birth. It was, after all, a natural process. There was little awareness of or planning for the time a body needed for healing and repair. I thought, if I can do this, I can do anything. When we arrived home with our firstborn, I refused to cancel the dinner with friends who were coming to stay the night. Yes, I said, it was a straightforward birth and how lucky am I? Of course I\u2019m fine; no issues. I didn\u2019t know what damage would come later. I didn\u2019t know how much rest a birthing body needs. I didn\u2019t know the elders understood this, that lying-in is a tradition for a reason. I thought offers of help were outmoded notions of old-fashioned womanhood. I didn\u2019t know that lying down and staying home would have let my body knit itself back together just a little bit more. That there\u2019s a humility in resting \u2013 the humility of finitude. *** In the last 30 years I have seen physiotherapists who specialise in women\u2019s health. In my case, this is a euphemism for pelvic floor health. And pelvic floor health is a euphemism for collapsing muscles and sagging organs \u2013 in turn euphemisms for the control I did not know I was giving up when I had those babies. By the time I reach my 40s, comedian Judith Lucy says it for me \u2013 \u201cYour pelvic floor is fucked? Get it carpeted!\u201d I asked a midwife once why she thought labour was so intense and painful. She looked at me unblinkingly and said, \u201cIt\u2019s to prepare you for what\u2019s ahead.\u201d In my 50s, 20 years after those babies, and after years of Pilates and physiotherapy, I have surgery. My prolapsed vaginal walls are lined with mesh, tightened and tucked. When the surgeon shows me a sample of the mesh, I look away. Who wants a kind of flywire embedded in their vaginal walls? It turns out I am one of the lucky ones. Many women have significant pain with this mesh \u2013 there are court cases and class actions. The surgeon is a good technician, a bad communicator. If a patient rings his rooms, the snippy receptionists cut them short. So, my women\u2019s health physiotherapist is my guide in preparation and follow-up to surgery. This physiotherapist has been an early leader in the field of pelvic floor recovery, and my questions make sense to her. I secretly dub her my Cheerful Coach: she is as colourful as a rainbow lorikeet. During the surgery, in addition to the mesh work, a sling is inserted to stop my uterus from collapsing into my vagina. The surgeon has also recommended a hysterectomy but a conversation with my GP changes my mind. I ask: \u201cHow will they extract my uterus if they\u2019re doing keyhole surgery?\u201d She says: \u201cThey will mince it up inside you and extract it piece by piece.\u201d I decide I will not do this. No, I say, don\u2019t take her. Support her. So they put in the sling. I imagine it as a kind of hammock where my uterus can put her feet up and relax after all the work of month-by-month readiness, and child holding, and the fearsome effort of expelling the baby from its inside swimming pool. But why do I wait until my 50s to give her time to put her feet up? When I ask Cheerful Coach how to describe the surgical intervention, she calls it \u201cpelvic reconstruction\u201d \u2013 right off the bat. This feels a lot better than the misery embodied in the word prolapse and the thought of embedded flywire. Prolapse has always invoked a sense of failure, as if I have somehow collapsed and not managed to keep myself intact. On my physiotherapist\u2019s watch I take six weeks bed rest post-surgery. No lifting, no weight-bearing, nothing heavier than a kettle of water. The rest makes sense; it gives the best chance for healing. And after secretly dreading its enforcement, I relish it. Who knew there was so much space in a day, that you could watch the shifting of the light, the movement of leaves, the pedestrian life in the street? Who knew that you could imbibe deep tranches of sleep, long spells of silence, inhabit other worlds narrated on audiobooks? Rest works. It doesn\u2019t heal everything but it helps. I wish I\u2019d known that when I had my babies. For me, the compulsion to keep going compromised the chance of ever really recovering from giving birth. I wish there\u2019d been a shape of living that made it possible to honour the work of birthing. It took me too long to unpick the narrative of being constantly time-poor and living life at speed, to pause as opposed to collapsing with exhaustion. There is no relapse, no further prolapse; it seems my private parts have now restored themselves. I am grateful for skilled surgery and proud of my recovery. I return to Pilates, attending weekly classes that build my core strength and help me integrate new awarenesses of posture and breath. And all these things help. Then comes that obstacle \u2013 a weakening for which it feels there is no help. *** Because now, in my 60s, this new problem. My faeces leak. Never large amounts, just teasers. Sometimes a lurking smear, sometimes like small pebbles. This will happen when I least expect it to. There\u2019s no warning, no urgency, no pressure. I have a bowel motion, I think it is finished, I go on with my life and move about. But my body has not finished. The leakages become more frequent \u2013 every week or two instead of months apart. My physiotherapist offers ways to manage this. I wear the disposable liners used for menstruation, but I\u2019m terrified I will smell. I ask my GP if she has managed people with faecal incontinence. The GP shakes her head. I drop my gaze. I do not like feeling exceptional \u2013 not like this. I ask Cheerful Coach about shame. Why does this feel so mortifying? More than once, throughout the years, health professionals have seen that I was blaming myself for my body\u2019s apparent failures. \u201cThis is not your fault,\u201d they\u2019d said. But while I\u2019d heard them and sensed their compassion, that default setting had a tidal pull. Cheerful Coach explains: \u201cWhen we lived in caves, if you were incontinent, the wild animals could smell you. You were a danger to the tribe.\u201d A sense of relief: this shame belongs in the reptilian part of the brain. Through a mutual friend, I meet a woman who has experienced far more dire episodes than my small embarrassments. She tells me the worst. While travelling in Europe in an ancient town, she could not find a toilet. In the end, on her way to the tiny bathroom at the back of a public bar, she lost an entire bowel motion. She describes it as the most abject experience of her life. We talk about fear and our forebears and what happened to their bodies. I wonder whether my problem will grow worse \u2013 what will become of me. And none of my friends talk about faecal incontinence. It\u2019s the last bastion, the last boundary of body-shaming. The only place I ever hear faecal incontinence referred to is in relation to aged care, where it\u2019s spoken of with the nose wrinkled. Yet one in 25 women will experience it. That\u2019s 4% of us. *** Is it a betrayal to speak the harsh truth that childbirth can cost a mother\u2019s body in ways that will never fully repair? To speak only of the wonderment of a new human? To tell, or not to tell? Is it a conspiracy of silence or a wise withholding? Which is why I deliberate for so long before I tell my daughter. Eventually I tell her exactly what is happening. She is considered. She is thoughtful. She asks excellent questions. I\u2019m relieved \u2013 for her and for myself. Because I had felt ashamed and thought she would feel ashamed of me. She is calm and respectful: \u201cCan you get some more help?\u201d *** I see a colorectal specialist. Colon. Rectum. These words sound too much like what they are. Colon: so slippery, like a python, like raw sausages. And the rectum: just plain ugly. In the operating theatre this surgeon inserts a tiny balloon into my backside to test the responsiveness of my sacral nerve. When the balloon is inflated, I can feel its movements. This is a good sign. I am then given anaesthetic, and he inspects my rectum and colon. Afterwards, the specialist explains what he\u2019s found in this investigation. My sphincter has lost its elasticity. He regrets he cannot just give me a new one. It is a not-funny joke. I have a question: did he find anything to explain the lack of warning? \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cAll normal. Nothing wrong with the sacral nerve.\u201d Conversation finished. Nothing to be done. I am an elastic band willing to stretch every which way until the spring has gone, and there is only sag. A human with no bounce: dammit. That\u2019s not me. I will not be that person, that worn-out, useless rubber band. In the end, I find a physio who specialises in faecal incontinence. Yes, you need to know there are these people.

Occasionally there is some leaking, but less often and less distressing. When I check in with the woman who had the abject experience, she says: \u201cI\u2019m organised now.

      "bodyText": "Sid Lowe was at the Bernabeu this evening, and his report has landed. Here it is! Thanks for reading this MBM, the last word of which goes to Peter Oh: \u201cReal Madrid fans were subjected to a gory horror Flick today. Halloween came early to the Bernabeu.\u201d A reminder also that Real Madrid\u2019s unbeaten La Liga run has come to an ignominious end. They made it 42 matches unbeaten, but that\u2019s one shy of Barcelona\u2019s record of 43, set between 2017 and 2018. Hey, nothing lasts forever, and if you\u2019re going to come up painfully short, you may as well do so in style. A dream cl\u00e1sico for Barcelona! They extend their lead over Real Madrid at the top of the table to six points, and make huge goal-difference gains as well. This isn\u2019t their biggest win at the Bearnabeu \u2013 they won 5-0 in 1974 \u2013 but it\u2019s big enough, though given the chances spurned by Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha, it could easily have been more. Much more. Having said that, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 had plenty of good opportunities as well, but a combination of the Barca offside trap and a none-shall-pass performance from I\u00f1aki Pe\u00f1a kept Real\u2019s star man out. On this evidence, Barca look a shoo-in for La Liga already, even though we\u2019re just 11 games in. They might take some beating in the Champions League as well. What a performance! It\u2019s a rout. It could have been more. 90 min +1: Incidentally, Gavi was booked a couple of minutes ago for wrestling with Vinicius, who was risking a second yellow himself. A red card really would put the tin lid on it for Real. 90 min: Mbappe shoots. Pena parries. The offside flag pops up. This is getting old. Thankfully for Real, there are only two extra minutes to play. 89 min: Carlo Ancelotti wasn\u2019t happy with the Barcelona celebrations, and went over to Hansi Flick, wagging his finger in the headmaster/policeman style. Flick was at pains to calm his opposite number down, palms front-facing. 88 min: Lewandowski delivers a low cross from the left for Raphinha, who can\u2019t get a shot away from six yards. Modric nips in to stop a certain fifth. From the resulting corner, Olmo blazes over the bar. 87 min: It all calms down, allowing both teams to make a change. Garcia comes on for Mendy, then Gavi replaces Pedri. 86 min: A brouhaha in the dugouts as the Barca squad celebrate this rout, the hosts not taking things well. At all. This is too easy for Barca now. Martinez launches a long ball down the middle. Vazquez is ahead of Raphinha, but the winger sprints past the dozing defender, and having got in ahead, gently wedges over the out-rushing keeper and into the net. Lovely finish, comically poor defending. 83 min: Valverde creams a low drive towards the bottom-left corner, but Pena has refused to be beaten in one-on-ones with Mbappe, and he\u2019s not going to be beaten by that. 82 min: Vinicius slaloms past Kounde and Cubarsi, entering the box from the left only to be relieved of possession by Martinez\u2019s last-ditch lunge. Great football all round. Then Pena is needlessly booked for unnecessary flapping of neck. 80 min: Vinicius is booked for a frustrated and petulant clip on the heel of Pedri. He\u2019s not happy with the referee, but can have little complaint. 79 min: That\u2019s Yamal\u2019s first cl\u00e1sico goal. It won\u2019t be his last. This is an outrageous finish. Raphinha drives hard, left to right. He slips the ball to Yamal, who steps into the box down the inside-right channel. He looks to have taken himself a little too far wide right, but that\u2019s not a problem, as he lashes a vicious rising shot into the top-right corner. Lunin with no chance, such was the velocity of that strike! What a goal. 76 min: Militao wins the ball off Olmo in the midfield and attempts to lob Pena from inside his own half. The arcing hoof sails wide left. Then Brahim comes on for Camavinga. 75 min: Martinez high-kicks Militao in the chest, and has the chutzpah to complain about the yellow card he receives. 73 min: Lunin clanks a clearance straight to Balde, 30 yards out, and the Real keeper is extremely fortunate the Barca defender doesn\u2019t launch an immediate attack. Barca get patient and Real get away with one. 71 min: Modric sends Mbappe clear down the middle. The usual story unfolds: Pena saves the shot; the flag pops up for offside anyway. No idea how this match is still 0-2. It could be 0-4 or 2-2 or 4-4 or 4-2 or anything either side or in between. 69 min: Kounde is booked for a late flip on Vinicius, out on the left flank. Modric takes the free kick, and finds Bellingham, free, six yards out. He\u2019s onside, having timed his spurt forward to perfection, but miscontrols and bundles the ball wide left of the target. A huge chance to haul Real back into contention goes begging. 68 min: This one would have counted, though! It\u2019s Yamal out on the left again. He crosses low. Lewandowski leans back and larrups a shot over the bar. What a miss! This game should be done and dusted. 67 min: \u2026 but no, that\u2019s all academic, too, because turns out Yamal was just offside in the build-up. 66 min: Lewandowski misses an open goal! Yamal sprints down the left and squares a pass to tee up his pal, eight yards out. Lewandowski opens his body and steers towards the bottom right, but this time gives it too much, and the ball pings off the outside of the post and out. He\u2019ll not get an easier chance to complete his hat-trick tonight! Could that end up costing Barca certain victory? 66 min: Mbappe sashays down the right, enters the box, and lashes an unstoppable shot across Pena and into the bottom left. But he doesn\u2019t bother celebrating, because he knows full well he\u2019s a mile offside. And then, up the other end \u2026 65 min: Olmo comes on for Casado. 64 min: Something nearly happens quickly for Madrid. Mbappe is sent clear down the middle, the offside trap circumvented, but he stabs his shot straight at Pena. Modric tries to return the rebound into the unguarded net, but shanks it wide. 63 min: Real need something to happen quickly, and so here comes Modric. He replaces Tchouameni. 62 min: If this match were to end now, the top of the table would look like this \u2026 \u2026 while Real\u2019s unbeaten La Liga run would end at 42 matches. One shy of Barcelona\u2019s record, set between 2017 and 2018. It\u2019s going pretty well for the Catalans right now. 61 min: Another corner for Real, Vinicius winning it out on the left. It\u2019s worked out to Mbappe, after a fashion. He sends a weak bobbler towards the bottom left. Easy for Pena. 59 min: Valverde swings a free kick into the Barca mixer from the left. Who rises to bash a header clear? Lewandowski. 58 min: Real, along with nearly everyone else in the Bernabeu, can\u2019t believe what\u2019s just happened. A big double-whammy is what\u2019s just happened. The hosts try to bounce back by winning a couple of corners, but the Barca defence deals with them easily enough. It\u2019s two in two minutes for Lewandowski! Balde, tight on the left touchline, swipes a delightful cross into the box. It drops exactly onto Lewandowski\u2019s head, six yards out. Lewandowski gives it the glancing eyebrows, and steers a brilliant header across Lunin and in! 56 min: It was tight, but Mendy was playing the Barca striker on. The Bernabeu stunned. And not half, because now \u2026 55 min: Real Madrid\u2019s offside trap not quite as fit for purpose as Barcelona\u2019s, then. Lewandowski is sent clear down the middle by Casado\u2019s simple defence-splitting pass. He\u2019s got all the time in the world to size up the situation on the edge of the box. He lines himself up and dispatches a low drive into the bottom-right. Lunin no chance! 52 min: Vinicius has been quiet, but now he steams in from the left, his low drive deflected out for a corner. Bellingham tries to meet the set piece, but falls over, claiming he\u2019s been impeded. The referee shows no interest. 51 min: Yamal tries to beat Lunin from the centre circle. Full marks for ambition if nothing else. An easy gather for Lunin. 50 min: Raphinha, quarterbacking from deep, launches long down the middle for Lewandowski, who is denied by Lunin, the keeper racing from his box to clear. The hosts haven\u2019t started this half particularly well. 49 min: Vazquez dinks a cross in from the right. Mbappe, initially in space to the left of the D, takes an uncharacteristically clunky touch and can\u2019t get a shot away, but his presence is enough to force a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece. A fairly scrappy start to the second period. 47 min: Kounde receives the ball this time, out on the right. His cross nearly finds Lewandowski in the middle, but Militao reads the danger and nips in to head clear. 46 min: The first act of the half, and under no pressure whatsoever, Casado sends a simple pass towards Kounde out of play. Onwards and upwards. Barca get the second half going. They\u2019ve made a change, replacing Lopez with De Jong. Half-time entertainment. There\u2019s top-of-the-table action going on everywhere. Some reasonably entertaining attacking by both sides, and an offside-trap masterclass from Barca. 45 min: The corner\u2019s a waste of time. There will be two additional first-half minutes. 44 min: Bellingham slides a pass down the right towards Mbappe, forcing Martinez to whack out for a corner. Vazquez to take. 43 min: Vinicius spins Casado deep inside his own territory, but isn\u2019t able to start a counter as the Barca man brings him down. Casado goes into the book. 41 min: Lamal, calling the shots from deep, very nearly threads a ball down the inside-left channel to release Raphinha clear on goal. Rudiger reads the situation expertly to intercept. Typically, the game being goalless, that move wouldn\u2019t have been offside. 40 min: Some pinball on the edge of the Real box suddenly releases Lewandowski into the area down the right. Lewandowski whistles a fierce rising shot wide and high, then the flag goes up for offside. I hope George Graham is watching this match, he\u2019ll be in hog heaven. 38 min: Bellingham slides in late on Casado and is fortunate not to be shown a yellow card. It looked for a second like the referee was going to produce one, running up to the player in determined fashion, but in the end a finger-wagging lecture sufficed. 36 min: Vinicius is caught offside down the left. That\u2019s the eighth time Real have been flagged off. \u201cI think on 19 minutes you meant: \u2018Hansi Flick delivering a PHD level coaching refresher class in playing a high line to Postecoglou\u2019,\u201d writes Ben Barclay, for whom recent events are very much his friend. I admit defeat. 35 min: Lewandowski goes down in the environs of Rudiger. Not sure what happened, but he\u2019s not happy. A sly knee in the coccyx? Ooyah, oof. The striker\u2019s fine after some regenerative rolling about. 33 min: Mbappe isn\u2019t taking that lying down, and powers down the middle this time before his shot is deflected away from danger by Martinez. Nothing comes of the resulting corner. 31 min: Scrap all that. Mbappe an inch off chasing the pass down the right channel. Barca\u2019s offside trap working really well for them. Mbappe breaks clear again, down the right, and this time the flag doesn\u2019t go up. He enters the box, draws Pena, and dinks a shot across and over the keeper, and into the bottom left. Easy as that! Mbappe scores in his first cl\u00e1sico appearance! 29 min: A bit of space for Pedri, just to the left of the D. A powerful shot towards the top left. Lunin parries it with a strong arm. The ball breaks to Raphinha, who tries to tee up a team-mate in the centre, only for Militao to extend a leg and divert it out for a corner. From the set piece, Martinez heads a decent chance over from eight yards. 27 min: \u2026 so having said that, Bellingham immediately breaks it with a burst down the middle. Barca get away with it, though, the Real midfielder taking an uncharacteristically agricultural touch and running the ball out for a goal kick. 26 min: Another big chance goes begging! Mbappe juggles his way down the inside-left channel before flicking infield for Camavinga, who bursts into the box before finding that ever-rippled side netting. Then up pops the flag. Barca\u2019s renowned offside trap working well for them so far. 24 min: Pedri is down with a sore ankle. Tchouameni caught him late. It was unintentional but clumsy. A very sore one. But good news: the medical man\u2019s spray is magic, and after a quick squirt, Pedri is soon up and about again. 22 min: Vinicius dribbles elegantly in from the left, leaves the flailing Kounde for dust, and drags a shot wide of goal from six yards. Everyone\u2019s left their shooting boots at home. 21 min: Rudiger\u2019s awful clearance gives Yamal the opportunity to drive forward. He lays off to Raphinha, who skies a shot from the edge of the D. Both sides have served up some pretty risible defending so far, and are fortunate the attacking, while very pretty at times, has been profligate. 19 min: Mbappe is sent scampering into acres down the right. He draws Pena before rolling across the face of the box towards Vinicius, who leans back and slices over the bar. An egregious waste, though again the offside flag spares blushes. Absolutely the correct decision this time, with Barca laying a Postecoglou-esque offside trap on the halfway line. 18 min: Barca string a few passes together, probing this way and that. The league leaders are refusing to be cowed by the intimidating Bernabeu atmosphere. 16 min: I mean, you could argue that Bellingham should never have given the keeper the opportunity to make his gymnastic intervention. But you\u2019d require a heart of stone to do so. It was a quite outrageous save \u2026 and yeah, again it\u2019s all academic, given the offside flag, but the point stands. 14 min: Camavinga rolls a pass down the left for Mbappe, who rolls across for Bellingham, sliding in at the far post. Bellingham must surely score, and he sticks out a telescopic leg to prod home, but somehow Pena, diving backwards, claws off the line sensationally. That\u2019s one of the great saves, and though the flag then goes up for an offside earlier in the move, take nothing away from it. What a save! 13 min: Barca respond by immediately sending Yamal on a drive down the middle. He scoops a weird shot straight at Lunin, who is grateful for the snaffle. Good fun this, already! 12 min: A simple long ball down the middle nearly costs Barcelona. Cubarsi doesn\u2019t know whether to attempt a headed clearance upfield or guide the ball back to the keeper. In the end he does neither, dismally cushioning into the path of Mbappe, who attempts to lob Pena from 40 yards. A fine effort only just clears the bar. 11 min: Militao nicks the foot of Raphinha, who needs a while to recover. Thankfully the Barca winger is up and about again quickly enough. 10 min: Yamal wedges a ball down the inside-left channel. It drops over Lewandowski\u2019s shoulder, but the striker can\u2019t connect with his swinging leg and the ball sails out for a goal kick. Half a chance that. The sort the volley-happy Robbie Fowler used to fancy. 8 min: Mendy\u2019s appalling heavy touch allows Yamal the opportunity to snatch possession and attack down the right. Mendy breathes again as the delivery is no good. All a bit scrappy early doors as the nerves settle. 7 min: Camavinga bullies a dithering Kounde in order to seize possession of the ball on the halfway line, but his pass down the flank for Mbappe is no good. Kounde needs to wake up quicksmart. 5 min: Valverde\u2019s second corner is headed behind for take three. Pena punches the final one of the sequence away with confidence. Real on top in these early stages. 4 min: Vinicius dribbles down the left and wins the first corner of the evening. Valverde swings it to the near post, where it\u2019s only half cleared, and Vinicius earns a second take. 2 min: Camavinga spins and passes down the inside-left channel in one smooth movement, releasing Mbappe on goal. Mbappe reaches the box, opens his body, and slams a sidefoot into the near side netting. He should have scored. His blushes are spared as the flag pops up for offside, though an initial replay suggests that might have been closer than it looked to the naked eye. The striker and Kounde looked suspiciously level. VAR would have had to get the rulers out \u2026 though it\u2019s all academic now, of course. 1 min: Real are immediately on the front foot, Valverde making a nuisance of himself down the right. Mbappe then reaches a ball on the byline and hooks it into the centre, but it\u2019s easy for Pena, and the flag goes up for offside anyway. Real get the ball rolling. The Bernabeu is bouncing. \u201cI must say I haven\u2019t been this excited for an El Cl\u00e1sico in a while,\u201d writes Philip Amadi-Emina. \u201cBring it on! On another note I still think Real Madrid don\u2019t and never needed Mbappe. The signing still feels like rims on a Lamborghini.\u201d Anyway, the players are out \u2026 and the home fans are giving it plenty. We\u2019ll be off in a minute. Real Madrid are on a good run against Barcelona. The Catalans last won el cl\u00e1sico in the league in March 2023, 2-1 at Camp Nou, a match played a couple of weeks after a 1-0 win in the semi-final of the Copa del Rey at the Bernabeu. But then Real won the second leg of that cup semi 4-0 in Barcelona, and since then it\u2019s been the Jude Bellingham show, the young English star notching injury-time winners in Catalonia later that October, and back in Madrid this April. Fold in the January final of the Supercopa and Real are looking to make it five competitive wins in a row. \u201cThese two might, just might, actually be the best teams in Europe again; this could be a battle the way it used to be, closer and more competitive than anyone anticipated \u2026 a clash of styles and identities \u2026 a clash of titans.\u201d Allow the good doctor to set the scene. The reigning champions Real Madrid are without Rodrygo and Thibaut Courtois, both of whom are injured. They\u2019re two of three changes to their starting XI after the 5-2 comeback win over Borussia Dortmund, with club captain Luka Modri\u0107 dropping to the bench; Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni and Eduardo Camavinga step into the midfield, while Andriy Lunin is in goal. Barcelona by contrast are unchanged in the wake of their 4-1 rout of Bayern Munich. Gavi, on his way back from long-term injury, is on the bench and will hope to add to the 12 minutes he\u2019s managed as a sub against Sevilla and Bayern since his return last weekend. Real Madrid: Lunin, Vazquez, Militao, Rudiger, Mendy, Bellingham, Valverde, Tchouameni, Camavinga, Mbappe, Vinicius Jr. Subs: Gonzalez, Mestre, Modric, Guler, Endrick, Vallejo, Ceballos, Garcia, Brahim. Barcelona: Pena, Kounde, Cubarsi, Martinez, Balde, Casado, Pedri, Yamal, Lopez, Lewandowski, Raphinha. Subs: Dominguez, Fati, Fort, Kochen, Martin, Olmo, Gavi, Szczesny, Torre, Victor, de Jong. Referee: Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda S\u00e1nchez Mart\u00ednez. Should Real Madrid avoid defeat in tonight\u2019s cl\u00e1sico, they\u2019ll equal the longest unbeaten run in La Liga history. Who holds the current record, which stands at 43 games? Let\u2019s not insult your intelligence by answering that, other than to say that particular team put together their sequence between 2017 and 2018. That\u2019s not the only reason Barcelona will want to beat Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s side tonight. A win for Hansi Flick\u2019s men would give them a serious advantage over the reigning champions in the race for the title, with just 11 games gone. So it really is all to play for, in more ways than one. Kick-off in Madrid is at 8pm BST, 9pm local. \u00a1Esta sucediendo!",

Three days after scoring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/23/barcelona-bayern-munich-champions-league-match-report\">four against Bayern Munich</a> to exorcise European ghosts, Hansi Flick\u2019s team came to the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u and scored four more, their wonderful week complete.

The team that apply the highest line in Europe, forcing more than twice the offsides of anyone on the continent, did it again.</p> \n<p>That speaks to the coordination, bravery too; it also comes with risks, especially against forwards as fast as Mbapp\u00e9 and Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, and that was played out immediately, Mbapp\u00e9 dashing clear after just 85 seconds. The position was perfect: coming in off the left, he opened up his body, dropped his shoulder and pulled the shot to the near post. The ball rippled the outside of the net and replays suggested he was offside anyway, a storyline developing early, supporters soon losing count.</p> \n<p>When Mbapp\u00e9 floated over I\u00f1aki Pe\u00f1a from way out; when Pe\u00f1a ade an astonishing save, clawing off the line; when Vin\u00edcius fired over and then hit the side-netting, the moves had something in common: each time Madrid raced into space and each time the flag went up, usually once the move concluded. Madrid had been caught offside six times inside half an hour of an enjoyable, wildly open game. By the end, that figure was 12.</p> \n<p>It wasn\u2019t entirely one way, either: an outrageous back-heeled assist from Lewandowski sent Lamine Yamal clean through but he scuffed the shot \u2013 he might have been offside too \u2013 Raphinha fired high, I\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez headed over and Andriy Lunin saved from Pedri.</p> \n<p>And then, on 30 minutes Mbapp\u00e9 scored, dashing through to lift it int the net. VAR called him offside, though; it was the fifth time he had been caught. Instead, it was Barcelona who found a way through into the space beyond to open the scoring. Madrid\u2019s line was broken by Ferland Mendy \u2013 it\u2019s not so easy, see? \u2013 and Lewandowski was ready, arching and timing his run the way Mbapp\u00e9 had not, to curl in a superb low finish.</p> \n<p>Two minutes later, Lewandowski scored again, heading in Alejandro Balde\u2019s cross. He should have a had a hat-trick too when they again cut through Madrid. Twice, in fact: the first, handed an open goal by Raphinha, was an astonishing miss, the shot hitting the post; the second, set up by Lamine Yamal, was then fired over.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you\u2019re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Between those, Mbapp\u00e9 escaped through the middle. Onside this time, he was denied by Pe\u00f1a. Soon after he dashed clear again but, knowing that he was offside, his shot lacked conviction. Madrid were in pieces, lacking in a plan. A mad, open game would have suited them but Barcelona weren\u2019t prepared to give it to them; instead, they took advantage of Madrid\u2019s search for it, one long ball seeing Raphinha sprint into space and lay on into the path of Lamine Yamal to smash into the roof of the net and another allowing him to lift over Pe\u00f1a to end it.</p> \n<p>There was just time for Mbapp\u00e9 to run free once more. The shot was saved and the flag was up, of course.</p>",

Kylian Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s was not: he had three shots without scoring, chances wasted, his big moment missed, and that\u2019s just the ones that counted in the stats: repeatedly caught in an expertly laid trap, there were many more that did not, including the two times he \u201cscored\u201d. That so much attention had been on Flick\u2019s offside trap was justified; less justified was that it had been considered reckless rather than genius, his philosophy a central feature of this cl\u00e1sico and Barcelona\u2019s success. The team that apply the highest line in Europe, forcing more than twice the offsides of anyone on the continent, did it again. That speaks to the coordination, bravery too; it also comes with risks, especially against forwards as fast as Mbapp\u00e9 and Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, and that was played out immediately, Mbapp\u00e9 dashing clear after just 85 seconds. The position was perfect: coming in off the left, he opened up his body, dropped his shoulder and pulled the shot to the near post. The ball rippled the outside of the net and replays suggested he was offside anyway, a storyline developing early, supporters soon losing count. When Mbapp\u00e9 floated over I\u00f1aki Pe\u00f1a from way out; when Pe\u00f1a ade an astonishing save, clawing off the line; when Vin\u00edcius fired over and then hit the side-netting, the moves had something in common: each time Madrid raced into space and each time the flag went up, usually once the move concluded. Madrid had been caught offside six times inside half an hour of an enjoyable, wildly open game. By the end, that figure was 12. It wasn\u2019t entirely one way, either: an outrageous back-heeled assist from Lewandowski sent Lamine Yamal clean through but he scuffed the shot \u2013 he might have been offside too \u2013 Raphinha fired high, I\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez headed over and Andriy Lunin saved from Pedri. And then, on 30 minutes Mbapp\u00e9 scored, dashing through to lift it int the net. VAR called him offside, though; it was the fifth time he had been caught. Instead, it was Barcelona who found a way through into the space beyond to open the scoring. Madrid\u2019s line was broken by Ferland Mendy \u2013 it\u2019s not so easy, see? \u2013 and Lewandowski was ready, arching and timing his run the way Mbapp\u00e9 had not, to curl in a superb low finish. Two minutes later, Lewandowski scored again, heading in Alejandro Balde\u2019s cross. He should have a had a hat-trick too when they again cut through Madrid. Twice, in fact: the first, handed an open goal by Raphinha, was an astonishing miss, the shot hitting the post; the second, set up by Lamine Yamal, was then fired over. Between those, Mbapp\u00e9 escaped through the middle. Onside this time, he was denied by Pe\u00f1a. Soon after he dashed clear again but, knowing that he was offside, his shot lacked conviction. Madrid were in pieces, lacking in a plan. A mad, open game would have suited them but Barcelona weren\u2019t prepared to give it to them; instead, they took advantage of Madrid\u2019s search for it, one long ball seeing Raphinha sprint into space and lay on into the path of Lamine Yamal to smash into the roof of the net and another allowing him to lift over Pe\u00f1a to end it. There was just time for Mbapp\u00e9 to run free once more. The shot was saved and the flag was up, of course.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cI like Fulham a lot and I like what they do and how they go about it,\u201d says the Everton manager in an interview with Sky Sports, after agreeing with Jamie Redknapp that Fulham were the better side. \u201cThey set their stall out and we didn\u2019t. We were a long way short of where we can be and where we have been recently. We ended up getting a point and I\u2019m really pleased with that. \u201cWe know we\u2019re not the real deal so it\u2019s a case of finding different ways of operating to get a point or get a win, so on a day when we weren\u2019t close to where I want us to be, we\u2019ve got a point and kept going and the mentality has stayed strong.\u201d \u201cWe are disappointed,\u201d says the Fulham boss in an interview with Sky Sports. \u201cEveryone that was at Goodison or watched the game at home had the feeling that the best team was Fulham. We controlled the game from the first minute until the last minute. Great 30 minutes from us at the start, nothing really from them. \u201cIn these type of games when you are much better and so superior to the other side, you have to score more. They were really lucky. We should have defended our box better. Our central defence should be closer to have an impact. The result was really unfair for my players. Unfortunately we didn\u2019t win the game.\u201d Emile Smith-Rowe: \u201cA real low blow today, we\u2019re really disappointed to concede in the last couple of minutes,\u201d the Fulham midfielder tells the BBC. \u201cI thought we dominated today which is really annoying, so not happy. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult, I thought we dominated at times and implemented the game plan really well and in the last few minutes you have to stay switched on and we didn\u2019t today. \u201cI had a really slow first half, so it was important for me to get on the ball in the second half and inject something into the game. It was a good goal by Alex [Iwobi] as well so I was happy with that but disappointed with how it ended today.\u201d Premier League match report: The second-half substitute Beto left it late to rescue a point for Everton after Alex Iwobi had returned to Goodison Park to haunt his former club. Andy Hunter reports from Merseyside \u2026 Beto: \u201c\u201cFor the supporters as well, they\u2019ve supported me,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re always singing my name. As a player you just want to pay it back. I always put it in my mind to be ready as the day may come. And today it came. I\u2019m happy to help the team, to help the Toffees. I will enjoy this one tonight, me and the team. Tomorrow is a day off.\u201d I\u2019m not sure Everton\u2019s fans are always singing his name, at least not in a particularly complimentary way, but they might sing it more often from here on in. Beto: \u201cIt means too much to me, because I work hard,\u201d says Everton\u2019s unlikely hero. \u201cEven if I don\u2019t play I still work hard. I put my head up every week, every day I want to try to improve and to be better. To be able to help the team, for me it\u2019s emotional because these last weeks were really difficult for me. God helped me and here I am today, happy because I scored a goal.\u201d Michael Keane: \u201cIt was a tough game,\u201d says the Everton defender in an interview with Sky Sports. \u201cThey had a lot of the ball and we struggled to get a press on them. They had a lot of the ball but Beto comes on in the second half, I end up going up top just to try something different really because we didn\u2019t create much today. Luckily, the big man was there to put one away.\u201d Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeeep! Beto\u2019s introduction was booed by Everton fans but the Guinea-Bissau international came up trumps deep in added time to rescue a point for his side with his fourth goal for the club. His header cancelled out a fine opener by Alex Iwobi, who had put Fulham ahead with a fine strike from the edge of the penalty area after excellent work by Emile Smith-Rowe. Fulham will see this as two points dropped after dominating for long periods but for Everton, it\u2019s very much a point gained. View the Premier League table 90+6 min: Harrison Reed sends a free-kick from deep into the Everton box, where Michael Keane leaps highest to head clear. The referee blows for full-time and Everton have maintained an unbeaten run that now stretches to five games by the skin of their pearly-whites. It\u2019s over at Goodison Park, where the points have been shared. Everton equalise! Oh my word! Ndiaye crosses to the far post from the left, Ashley Young steers a volley back across the face of goal and Beto is quickest to react. He heads home from close range to level the score. 90+2 min: Fulham double-substitution: Rodrigo Muniz and Jorge Cuenca on for Jimenez and Iwobi. It\u2019s Cuenca\u2019s Premier League debut after two appearances in the Carabao Cup. 90+1 min: We\u2019re into six minutes of extras, with Fulham on the ball as they try to close this game out. 90 min: Beto leaps to get his head to a cross from the left but under pressure from Bassey, is unable to get too much purchase on his header. Leno gets down to save fairly comfortably. 89 min: It\u2019s kitchen sink time for Everton, whose promising finish to the first half has not been replicated in the second. Fulham have been in the ascendency since the break and should probably be further ahead. 87 min: Beto stumbles into the Fulham penalty area with the ball at his feet and is off balance when he shoots. His effort is blocked but he wins a corner from his side. Nothing comes of it. 85 min: No, he is not. He retires to the bench and is replaced by Jarrad Brantwaithe, who comes on for only his second appearance of the season. The gods above Goodison give with one hand and take away with the other. 84 min: There\u2019s a break in play while Dwight McNeil receives treatment for what looks like a knee injury. He looks OK to continue. 82 min: Lindstrom curls a shot goalwards from the edge of the Fulham penalty area after good work from Ndiaye on the left wing. It\u2019s straight at Leno and doesn\u2019t take much saving. 80 min: Everton double-substitution: Beto and Orel Mangala on for Doucoure and Calvert-Lewin. The Goodison Park faithful are unimpressed with those changes. 79 min: Fulham double-substitution: Harrison Reed and Harry Wilson on, Emile Smith-Rowe and Andreas Pereira off. 77 min: Fulham have a shot blocked and the ball drops Jimenez\u2019s way on the edge of the Everton penalty area. He chests it down and tries to volley it into the top corner but his effort fizzes over. 76 min: Tarkowski is booked for a challenge on Issa Diop as the Fulham centre-back went on a rampaging gallop upfield. The Everton centre-half is furious, as he believes Emile Smith-Rowe should have been penalised for a worse challenge on Idrissa Geuye a few moments previously. He might have a point. 73 min: Nelson comes this close to getting to a speculative Periera pass in behind and it briefly looked as if the substitute might be able to hook the ball over the head on the onrushing Pickford. The bounce doesn\u2019t go his way and the Everton goalkeeper claims. 71 min: Nelson sends a cross to the far post, where Iwobi tries to tee up Smith-Rowe. The Fulham midfielder can\u2019t quite get on the end of his lay-off. 71 min: Reiss Nelson has taken up a position on the left wing for Fulham, with the goalscorer Iwobi moving to the other side. 69 min: Fulham substitution: Reiss Nelson is on for Adama Traore. Everton substitution: Jesper Lindstrom on for Jack Harrison. 67 min: I have one job but somehow still managed to credit Fulham\u2019s opener to Everton in the headline and for that I humbly apologise. The record has now been corrected but my toes will take a lot longer to uncurl. 65 min: Antonee Robinson runs on to a ball in behind from Iwobi and drills the ball across the face of goal. Jordan Pickford gets down to intercept and Everton scramble clear. 63 min: That was an excellent goal from Fulham, with Smith-Rowe rampaging through the Everton half, charging past three blue shirts and playing the ball inside to Iwobi, whose low finish was superb. Fulham lead! The celebration is muted but the finish was not. Iwobi scores against his former club, firing with precision into the bottom corner after Emile Smith-Rowe had slalomed upfield past three or four Everton defenders before playing the ball inside to his teammate. 58 min: Kenny Tete fouls Calvert-Lewin to give away a cheap free-kick a long way out but McNeil\u2019s delivery into the Fulham box is poor. Bernd Leno catches the ball under no pressure whatsoever. 56 min: Jack Harrison tries to cross from the right but his delivery is deflected off the outstretched foot of Robinson and loops up in the air. Fulham clear their lines. 56 min: Andreas Pereira tries his luck from outside the Everton penalty area but pulls his low diagonal effort wide of the far post. 54 min: Gueye is penalised somewhat harshly for bringing down Jimenez in the centre-circle. The duo were contesting a 50-50 ball and it seems like needlessly fussy officiating by John Brooks in a second half that has yet to spring into any kind of life. 53 min: Attendance watch: 38,742. 51 min: Fulham, who have yet to score from a set-piece this season, waste a corner and gift the ball back to Everton. Pereira and Smith-Rowe are the guilty men, the latter coughing up very cheap possession to Gueye. 49 min: Pereira tries to pick out Jiminez with a ball in behind from deep but the Fulham striker has to stretch to (mis)control the ball after bursting between two defenders. Pickford is a grateful beneficiary of his poor touch. 47 min: It\u2019s a scrappy start to the second half and Adama Traore is penalised for a needless shove on Myolenko down by the byline. The two of them are having an intriguing battle which the Fulham winger is just about edging on my scorecard. 46 min: Michael Keane plays the ball back to Jordan Pickford after Antonee Robinson had played a speculative through ball in behind the Everton defence. 46 min: Dwight McNeil gets the second half under way for Everton, who are playing into the Gwladys Street End. Dominic Calvert-Lewin had the ball in the net for Everton, only to have his tap-in ruled out for offside after Idrissa Gana Gueye had smashed a wonderful shot off the underside of the bar from 25 yards out. Dwight McNeil will also feel he should have scored for Everton, after Mykolenko teed him up with an excellent cross. Fulham have gone close too, with Emile Smith Rowe, Adama Traore, Andreas Pereira and Alex Iwobi all passing up chances ranging from the half-decent to the excellent. This game is there for the taking. 44 min: A Traore cross from the right is chested down by Jimenez into the path of Iwobi, who\u2019d shouted at him to leave it for him, at the far post. Leaning back as he shoots, the Fulham midfielder fires over the bar from about five yards. Yet another excellent chance goes to waste but at least Traore is starting to get some decent crosses in. It\u2019s half-time. 42 min: An Adama Traore cross from the right is too high for Raul Jiminez but drops kindly for Smith-Rowe at the far post. Perhaps caught unawares, his first touch is woeful and he runs the ball out of play. 38 min: Mykolenko sends an inch-perfect whipped cross from the left into the path of Dwight McNeil, who sends a thumping header straight at Bernd Leno. He should have scored! 36 min: The game drags itself up the Match of the Day pecking order as Tete fires over for Fulham, then Calvert-Lewin is denied again, this time by some good defending from Sander Berge. This is much better from both sides. 34 min: That looked close. I thought Calvert-Lewin was just about being played onside by Kenny Tete but the curtain-twitchers in Stockley Park got their rulers and set-squares out before agreeing with the onfield decision. 30 min: Ndiaye takes on Tete down the left flank and plays the ball inside to McNeil. It finds its way to Idrissa Gueye, who smashes the ball against the bar from distance. It breaks to Calvert-Lewin, who spanks it home on the follow-up, only for his effort to be ruled out for a very tight offside. 28 min: Adama Traore tries his luck, smashing a shot towards the near post only to be denied by Pickford. Everton fail to clear the ball and a cross towards the far post is headed back across the face of goal towards Smith-Rowe by Jiminez. The Fulham midfielder has to stretch and is unable to keep his volley down and fires over the bar. 26 min: Adama Traore gets the better of Myolenko by the right touchline but his cross into the Everton penalty area is dismal. The ball bounces in front of Michael Keane, who hacks clear. 23 min: Iliman Ndiaye wins a cheap free-kick for Everton wide on the left a long way out, going to ground under minimal contact from Tete. Dwight McNeil sends the ball into the penalty area, where Alex Iwobi is able to steer a header towards Leno. 20 min: Tete tries to play Traore in behind the Everton defence with a pass to the byline but overhits his delivery and sends the ball out for a goal-kick. It\u2019s that kind of game. 18 min: Sander Berge slips while trying to control a dropping ball in a central area and inadvertently touches it with his hand. The referee waves play on. 16 min: While it\u2019s far too early to call it definitively, this match already looks to be a prime candidate for \u201cLast on the Match of the Day running order\u201d. Truth be told, it was almost certainly among the favourites before a ball had been kicked this weekend. Brentford 4-3 Ipswich Town is currently the one to beat for top billing. 14 min: Another curled Mykolenko ball from deep into the Fulham penalty area is headed clear by Antonee Robinson. The American really put his back \u2013 and his head, obviously \u2013 into that one. 12 min: Jiminez and Pereira link up just outside the Everton box and for reasons best known to himself, the Brazilian eschews a shooting opportunity with the ball sitting up nicely for him, the goal at his mercy and Tarkowski off balance in front of him. A good chance goes to waste for Fulham. 11 min: Pereira plays the ball out wide to Adama Traore but overhits his pass, fails to find the Fulham winger and sends it out for a throw-in. 9 min: Everton fans appeal for a penalty after Calvert-Lewin goes to ground claiming he\u2019d been fouled by Bassey. There was contact, but gravity had got the better of the Everton striker before Bassey arrived on the scene. 7 min: Kenny Tete swings a cross into the Everton boss from the right. Raul Jimenez gives Tarkowski a nudge to make room for himself but shoots weakly into the gloves of Jordan Pickford. On current form you\u2019d expect the Mexican international to do better, although VAR might have intervened if he\u2019d scored because he did seem to shove Tarkowski. 5 min: Mykolenko tries to curl a pass from deep into the path of Dominic Calvert-Lewin but slightly overhits his delivery. Calvin Bassey cleans up at the back for Fulham. 4 min: It\u2019s eerily quiet inside Goodison Park in these very early stages, as both teams try to suss each other out. 3 min: Iliman Ndiaye puts the ball out of play for a Fulham throw-in while trying to link up with Mykolenko down the left touchline. He was operating in a very tight space, so we won\u2019t be too critical. 2 min: Andreas Pereira throws himself to the ground just outside the Everton penalty area after a very minor coming-together with Vitaliy Mykolenko. He\u2019s chancing his arm and the referee is having none of it. 1 min: Fulham get the ball rolling and it doesn\u2019t take long to find its way back to the feet of their goalkeeper, Bernd Leno. Goodison Park remembers: In an otherwise silent stadium, Sergeant Andy Manning plays The Last Post after members of assorted British military forces march out on to the pitch to lay commemorative wreaths. Not long now: The players make their way out on to the pitch and with this being Everton\u2019s final home game ahead of Remembrance Sunday, team captains Bernd Leno and James Tarkowski will lay poppy wreaths in the centre-circle ahead of the usual pre-match formalities. The Premier League table: Today\u2019s results, not least Brentford\u2019s whiteknuckle win against Ipswich Town, means that Fulham go into this match in 12th place, while Everton remain in 16th. View the Premier League table Dominic Calvert-Lewin: With his contract due to expire at the end of the season, the Everton striker is showing no great inclination to sign a new one and looks set to leave the club on a free transfer at the end of the season unless the club decide to sell him in January to recoup some money. However, Sean Dyche has ruled out the possibility, saying survival in the Premiership is worth more than any funds that might be generated by the sale of the striker. \u201cThe bigger prize in this case is Premier League football for Everton Football Club,\u201d said the manager. \u201cYou know when I came in it was like you need to safeguard what we\u2019re doing, so that\u2019s the No 1 priority. Along that journey and timeline we\u2019ve had to obviously bring money in. That\u2019s been quite apparent and spend less and bring more in, lower the wages of course. \u201cBut to be giving players away at any cost because you need some money, fortunately we\u2019ve never been pushed that far and that\u2019s still the same now. We can still make decisions on situations and I can\u2019t see anything other than him being here certainly until the end of his contract and then hopefully beyond. We\u2019ll see.\u201d Marco Silva: Having spent a little over 18 months in charge of Everton from June 2018 and taken to them to an eighth place finish in the Premier League, Marco Silva is likely to get a warm welcome on what is likely to be his final visit to Goodison Park this afternoon ahead of the club\u2019s move to their new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock. The Fulham manager remembered his time at Goodison Park fondly when the subject was raised at his press conference yesterday. \u201cIt was an honour to manage a club like Everton,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not the first or last, for sure, to say that because when you are there, you can feel how it\u2019s a big club, how they have a massive fan base. \u201cIt\u2019s a historic [stadium], an old school one as well and there\u2019s something special around the place. You can feel it. As a home manager, you can feel it more because it\u2019s week-in, week-out. Even when you go there playing away you can feel it as well. It\u2019s a special place to play.\u201d Today\u2019s match officials Referee: John Brooks. Assistants: Simon Bennett and Darren Cann. Fourth official: Leigh Doughty. VAR: Stuart Attwell.

Carlos Vniicius and Jorge Cuenca are both due to be assessed ahead of kick-off but neither player is likely to start.

Central defender Jarrad Brantwaithe and midfielder Jesper Lindstrom will both be included in today\u2019s matchday squad after recovering from injury and illness respectively. Goodison Park is the venue for this evening\u2019s set-to between Everton and Fulham, where the hosts will attempt to make it five top flight games without defeat following a dreadful start to the season that saw them lose their opening four games. They entertain a Fulham side that arrive on the back of consecutive defeats at the hands of Manchester City and Aston Villa, although it could legitimately be argued they deserved to take a point from at least one, if not both of those matches. Kick-off on Merseyside is at 5.30pm but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.",

As we left the station, Michael stopped. He held out his hand and gently opened it. Out flew the moth, up into the sky. I was blown away, I had no idea he had rescued it. He too had felt compassion for such a tiny creature, and although I don\u2019t think he quite realised at the time, his small act of kindness represented something so much more for me. My heart opened to him. I knew in that moment what a wonderful, kind man he was, and that I loved him. Michael has shown this quality many times over the years. Perhaps it\u2019s his Dutchness, but he\u2019s never afraid of speaking up for what\u2019s right, calling out a bully or going out of his way to support people in need. He can have a room full of complete strangers feeling at ease within seconds and is not afraid to make himself the butt of the joke to get everyone laughing. We\u2019ve been married for 20 years, with a mixed family of seven kids who have grown up too fast \u2013 the youngest has just turned 18. I just can\u2019t imagine life without Michael. He\u2019s my best friend, my soulmate and he\u2019s shown me what true, unconditional love in a family really is. And of course, we still happily share a glass of wine or two together.",

      "bodyText": "In Tasmania, no one has to wear an ice-cream container with eyes on their head when magpies are breeding. That\u2019s because the magpies there don\u2019t swoop \u2013 and no one knows why. Magpie Alert, a website that tracks and maps swoops and any resultant injuries, shows 3,271 reported swoopings and 426 injuries around Australia so far this year. None of them are in Tasmania. Eric Woehler, a Tasmanian bird ecologist, says there are regional variations in magpies. Some think a genetic difference might explain why Tasmanian magpies don\u2019t go for human eyeballs, but he doubts that theory. \u201cIt would be self-defeating,\u201d he says, because the male swoops to protect the female as she incubates her eggs. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads He says it could be that Tasmania\u2019s urban density isn\u2019t as high as other places, or that it has more open, green space, so the birds are more relaxed and less aggressive with fewer intruders. \u201cIt might be one factor, it might be 100 factors,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. It\u2019s an unknown quantity why Tasmanian birds behave noticeably differently to mainland birds.\u201d Gisela Kaplan, a University of New England emeritus professor in animal behaviour, says Tasmanian magpies are smaller, which might make them more careful about taking someone on. She says magpies would prefer not to swoop and only do it to defend their families from invaders. Other birds, including noisy miners, butcherbirds, masked lapwings and magpie larks also swoop in breeding season. But the magpie is guilty of inflicting the most eye injuries. On Magpie Alert, there are also reports of ear injuries. \u201cSarge\u201d says he was swooped 15 or more times while riding his bike on Federation Trail in Melbourne. \u201cInjured left ear hit five times, lot of blood. Also blood drawn left elbow,\u201d he reports. Woehler says the \u201ciconic\u201d Australian magpie gets a bad rap. \u201cThey\u2019re remarkably intelligent, with strong social bonds \u2013 a unit that lives together, works together, looks after each other,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they are very tolerant of people. They come into our suburbs, our peri-urban areas, taking advantage of open space and gardens to feed. They\u2019ve injected themselves into our lives. \u201cThey\u2019re defending their eggs, their chicks, and we\u2019re seen as a threat. They are much maligned for basically being good parents.\u201d Kaplan, the author of Australian Magpie: Biology and Behaviour of an Unusual Songbird, says people focus on the swooping, but that a bird will only swoop for about four weeks while the female is on the nest. The birds are intriguing and far more complex than anyone thought 20 years ago, she says. \u201cSince then lots of research has come out about their cognitive and problem-solving abilities,\u201d she says. \u201cMagpies are particularly charming and \u2026 they have set rules about the ways they interact.

As for those on the mainland hoping to avoid attack, Kaplan says there are better ways to protect yourself beyond cable ties and ice-cream cartons (or holographic anti-swooping tape). Make friends with the magpie, she says. Let them see your face. Once a magpie has seen your face and realises you mean no harm, it\u2019ll recognise you forever and leave you alone.

Did </strong><em><strong>you</strong></em><strong> want to be a dwarf?</strong></p> <p>Yeah! I\u2019d like to be in a Hobbit film in any capacity. I\u2019d have been quite happy to be a dwarf. But I did think that a petition is not the right way to go about getting that to happen.

I would have done Tom Bombadil happily. But tell you what, there\u2019s some dodgy old beards in this Rings of Power show. I\u2019ve been watching it.

When he sings those songs, thousands of people are in a state of rapture, a kind of reminiscence about where they first heard the song, what it means to them and their lives. What I wanted to say to him was, \u201cIt\u2019s a very rare thing you have created, a cultural moment where everyone from all these different backgrounds have their own connection with your songs, until they are almost beyond songs, in a way \u2013 they are a part of our cultural fabric.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, it didn\u2019t pan out like that at all. Kev had just had a baby so we were wetting the baby\u2019s head, as it were. We\u2019d had a few drinks. We were hyped up.

Kev was looking at me, going, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d I was so nervous that I\u2019d forgotten how to speak properly so then I started trying to rehearse how to speak under my breath, while we all just looked at each other.</p> <p>The next day, I asked Kev what I\u2019d said and he sent me this hilarious transcript of the exact gibberish. I had tried to say, \u201cYour songs are enmeshed in the cultural fabric\u201d, but almost said \u201centrenched\u201d by accident. I changed it to \u201cenmeshed\u201d too late, so I said: \u201cYour songs are enmenched!\u201d Paul went, \u201cEnmenched?\u201d And I didn\u2019t know what I had said, so I went, \u201cWhat?

Is that true, or were they trying to sell me wine? Brown Hill\u2019s Bill Bailey shiraz cabernet! I do, yeah. It is actually very good. Luckily. I came across it years ago when I was performing in Australia and obviously thought, I better try some of this. And then last year, when I was filming in Western Australia, I got to go to the vineyard and meet everyone and have a look around. That was great. It is named after a relative of theirs, not after me. Everyone assumes it is me. They did take a lot of photos while I was there, maybe my face is going to be placed on the label? I\u2019m quite happy with that, it\u2019s a nice drop. It would be awful if it was a weird energy drink or something. What do you do when you can\u2019t get to sleep? Usually I play a word game on my phone. I\u2019m completely addicted to Spelling Bee. Sometimes when I\u2019m stuck, I have been known to co-opt complete strangers and say, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to have a word starting with \u2018n-e\u2019, would you?\u201d If I finish it, I feel a kind of Zen calm and and can fall asleep immediately. What is the best thing you\u2019ve seen an animal do? I saw giant oceanic manta rays off the coast of Bali, near an island called Nusa Lembongan. These were huge mantas \u2013 not far off 30 feet [9 metres] from wingtip to wingtip. They are so big that you forget to breathe. There were so many of them and they were all circling, like they were playing or dancing or something. It was amazing. This is one of those things about nature \u2013 you never quite know when or how or why something is happening, but you feel like you\u2019ve suddenly intruded on some ancient ritual that\u2019s been going for millions of years. The guy who took me out there said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been diving here for 30-40 years and I\u2019ve never seen this.\u201d There\u2019s a tendency to think that animals\u2019 survival instinct is above all else, that there\u2019s no element of play or ritual. And then you see something like that and realise we don\u2019t know the half of it. In 2007 fans started a petition to get you cast as a dwarf in the Hobbit films. Did you want to be a dwarf? Yeah! I\u2019d like to be in a Hobbit film in any capacity. I\u2019d have been quite happy to be a dwarf. But I did think that a petition is not the right way to go about getting that to happen. Imagine the casting director going: \u201cOh yes, we\u2019re looking at this person, this person \u2026 oh, but here\u2019s the petition guy with a big pile of signatures that say we have got to use him.\u201d No one wants the petition guy! I mean, it was very sweet of them to do it, but I think they might have actually kiboshed the whole enterprise. You\u2019d be a good Tom Bombadil. Yeah, that\u2019s more me. I would have done Tom Bombadil happily. But tell you what, there\u2019s some dodgy old beards in this Rings of Power show. I\u2019ve been watching it. They have a gazillion bajillion dollars and they still can\u2019t do a good wig? This proto Gandalf fella, he\u2019s wearing a grubby old towelling robe that makes him look like he\u2019s walked out of a cheap motel. His beard is all over the place. You\u2019re a flipping wizard, mate! You spent too much money on the orcs, guys. You\u2019ve forgotten about the bathrobes. Anyway, I still watch it. Obviously. Do you have a party trick? I can flip a lot of beer mats. Like, a lot. Way more than you think I\u2019d be able to do. I can\u2019t tell you the exact number, but loads. You\u2019d see me do it and say, \u201cThere\u2019s no way.\u201d Like 30, all in one go. What is your least favourite bird? It seems harsh to have a least favourite. It implies that there\u2019s a meritocracy about nature. I try to find good in all birds, even your humble pigeon, which some people \u2013 particularly in London \u2013 seem to view as vermin. But they bathe in our garden in our little bird bath and they\u2019re quite beautiful, even though they are the common, scuffy city hustlers. They\u2019re lovely. Even the lowliest birds, I can find some good in. What\u2019s been your most cringeworthy run-in with a celebrity? Me and my mate Kev went to see Paul McCartney play at the O2 Arena in London. When he sings those songs, thousands of people are in a state of rapture, a kind of reminiscence about where they first heard the song, what it means to them and their lives. What I wanted to say to him was, \u201cIt\u2019s a very rare thing you have created, a cultural moment where everyone from all these different backgrounds have their own connection with your songs, until they are almost beyond songs, in a way \u2013 they are a part of our cultural fabric.\u201d Of course, it didn\u2019t pan out like that at all. Kev had just had a baby so we were wetting the baby\u2019s head, as it were. We\u2019d had a few drinks. We were hyped up. We got invited back stage to say hello and I thought, I\u2019ve got to say something eloquent, something he\u2019s not heard before. Paul McCartney came over. What completely threw me was that he recognised me first. So he said \u201cBill Bailey!\u201d and all of my preparation went out the window. I started babbling this pre-prepared speech that was all back to front. I said, \u201cPaul, you\u2019re, with the song, like, isn\u2019t it like, a cultural part of the thread, with, you know, like Yesterday? Everyone in the culture?\u201d It was just gibberish. Kev was looking at me, going, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d I was so nervous that I\u2019d forgotten how to speak properly so then I started trying to rehearse how to speak under my breath, while we all just looked at each other. The next day, I asked Kev what I\u2019d said and he sent me this hilarious transcript of the exact gibberish. I had tried to say, \u201cYour songs are enmeshed in the cultural fabric\u201d, but almost said \u201centrenched\u201d by accident. I changed it to \u201cenmeshed\u201d too late, so I said: \u201cYour songs are enmenched!\u201d Paul went, \u201cEnmenched?\u201d And I didn\u2019t know what I had said, so I went, \u201cWhat? What\u2019s enmenched?\u201d This is not how it was supposed to go, me going, \u201cWhat are you on about?\u201d at Paul McCartney! It was hellish. Bill Bailey is touring Australia until 24 November; see here for dates. His memoir My Animals, and Other Animals is out now in Australia and the UK ($34.99, \u00a325)",

The Kmart transformation has accelerated post-pandemic, according to UBS analysts, with the retailer now drawing in equal numbers of low, middle and high-income customers, representing a break from the discount store\u2019s battler-focused past.

It took Manchester United 24 years to win the league after Matt Busby departed and it has been 11 without success since Sir Alex Ferguson left. It took Leeds 18 years to win the league again after Don Revie took the England job, although it could be argued they have never really recovered. It was 12 years after Harry Catterick left when Everton won the league again and they have not won it since Howard Kendall moved to Spain. The shadows of Rinus Michels, Hennes Weisweiler and Brian Clough still hang over Ajax, Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach and Nottingham Forest. Countless Dynamo Kyiv managers have found themselves asking: \u201cWhat would Valeriy Lobanovskyi do?\u201d That is always the problem. Football is constantly evolving. Managers must change. But the new manager must strike a balance. Stay too true to the celebrated predecessor\u2019s methods and the new man risks becoming nothing but a poor imitation, even as football\u2019s cutting edge disappears into the distance; change too much and players, fans and journalists will cry betrayal. Always, if things go wrong, there is the thought of the great predecessor \u2013 or in the case of United, the man himself \u2013 looking on in disapproval, the whisper around the club: it was not like this in his day.

This is the source of our communal dread | Tim Winton</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>To be a moral society, we need to rediscover and restore solidarity \u2013 with our Earth, and with its creatures and peoples.</p> \n<p>But solidarity is anathema to capitalism, especially the brute version that\u2019s spread and metastasized in the past 40 years. Fellow-feeling has been trained out of us. Two generations have been raised to fight a war of all against all, rendering us competitors and consumers when we could have been citizens and allies.</p> \n<p>To face the anguish and chaos of climate breakdown, which is the miserable legacy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/28/it-makes-us-chumps-tim-winton-speaks-out-against-fossil-fuel-sponsorship-of-perth-festival\">fossil capitalism</a> or business-as-usual, we\u2019ll need to skill up again and retrieve the best in ourselves. Only then do we stand a chance of not consigning our descendants to hell.</p> \n<p>I have no neat answer for how to revive solidarity. But I\u2019m certain it won\u2019t emerge from the pitiless dog-eat-dog mentality that got us into this crisis. Nor will it spring from those who revere convention, crave respectability and align themselves with the powerful against the weak.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Having spent so long insatiably gilding the present by looting the future, transformative change is our only hope</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Moments of real human progress \u2013 from the abolition of slavery to the advent of workers\u2019 rights and the struggle for women\u2019s suffrage \u2013 have always sprung from empathy, vulnerability, imagination and disruption. From new concepts born in adversity. From fresh language that\u2019s honest and calls out injustice, emboldening resistance and inspiring courage. And in deeds that are audacious, selfless and unforeseen, even shocking.</p> \n<p>This is the stuff that draws us together and bears us up as one. Such words and deeds will be dangerous to the status quo, and there will be fear and rage in them. But for solidarity to endure, these must, in the end, be expressions of love, not of vengeance.</p> \n<p>Love isn\u2019t always gentle, though. For love makes. And it breaks. That\u2019s the price of commitment \u2013 for communities as much as for individuals. Positive change is hard. Transformations and transitions are messy, they require sacrifice \u2013 not from the weak and oppressed, but from the powerful and prideful. Under capitalism that will feel deeply discordant, but it\u2019s non-negotiable.</p> \n<p>Having spent so long insatiably gilding the present by looting the future, transformative change is our only hope.</p> \n<p>Naomi Klein says: \u201cIf we don\u2019t demand radical change we are headed for a whole world of people searching for a home that no longer exists.\u201d In other words, we will have expelled ourselves from Eden all over again.</p> \n<p>Pope Francis says that as a matter of urgency, we need to undergo \u201can ecological conversion\u201d.</p> \n<p>New and unlikely threads of solidarity have been emerging for a while. You may not know about them, but across generations, religions, races, classes and time zones, new alliances are forming every day. The Pope\u2019s \u201cecological conversion\u201d is afoot.</p> \n<p>Thirty years and several popes ago, Thomas Berry was busy laying some of the conceptual groundwork for it. A priest of the Passionist order, Berry described our dependency on fossil fuels as a global addiction.</p> \n<p>Addiction is a form of captivity and degradation. Getting off the gear is hard, and recovery is messy, but the allies you find on the way are deeply surprising. And they\u2019re life-changing.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/oct/03/tim-winton-juice-book-interview\">Tim Winton: \u2018I lived in the worst possible space for seven years. It knocks some paint off you, I can tell you\u2019</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But before you hit rock bottom as an addict, you\u2019re in the grip of denial. There are so many lies you tell yourself and others. And, of course, while <em>you </em>suffer, there\u2019s always someone profiting from your illness.</p> \n<p>When you suspect someone has overdosed on an opiate, you find yourself walking them around while you wait for the ambulance. You shout at them, shake them, plead with them to stay awake, to stay with you.</p> \n<p>Now, think of all the scientific and activist voices who have been pleading with us over recent years to stay conscious. They\u2019ve done everything in their power to save us from sinking back into our deadly cultural and political stupor. Their efforts have been selfless and heroic. And yet we\u2019ve scorned them. At best, we patronise them.</p> \n<p>The American poet Christian Wiman writes that \u201cto attend is to atone\u201d. Think about that.</p> \n<p>Because right now, legions of young people are divesting themselves of our sad and lonely captivity to business as usual. And they\u2019re getting organised, networking, skilling up, raising their voices and literally placing their bodies in the path of those who profit from our addiction.</p> \n<p>Politicians castigate them. The media vilifies them.</p> \n<p>Yes, these young patriots can be awkward to contend with. They feel so vexatious and countercultural. All their banners and slogans. Their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/mar/05/climate-protest-extinction-rebellion-melbourne-west-gate-bridge-deanna-violet-coco-\">blockades slowing our commute</a>. All those difficult questions they ask at shareholder meetings.

Many of them can\u2019t even vote yet. They\u2019re trying what they can, snatching whatever fleeting opportunity is available to them in a polity that shuts them out at every point \u2013 financially, politically, culturally.</p> \n<p>But their voices are prophetic.</p> \n<p>Prophets speak truth to power \u2013 and we know what happens to prophets. To the mighty and comfortable, the truth is a threat. It must be intimidated, arrested, beaten, shot and, yes, crucified to produce the silence required to maintain business as usual.</p> \n<p>Prophets try to shake their communities awake. And that\u2019s all these kids are trying to do.</p> \n<p>Yes, they\u2019re right up in our faces, blocking our path, begging us not to sink back into cosy oblivion. Because they know what our junkie habit is doing to creation, to our home and to their future. If things don\u2019t change \u2013 and fast \u2013 they will be damned for our sins. And their sense of forsakenness is being ignored.</p> \n<p>But it\u2019s worse than that. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/14/climate-activists-have-received-months-long-sentences-are-tougher-laws-eroding-australians-right-to-protest\">Because now they\u2019re being persecuted</a> on our watch, in our name and on our dime.</p> \n<p>By and large, we turn our heads and walk on by. Even those of us steeped in religious teachings urging us to defend the weak, the oppressed and the outcast.</p> \n<p>We\u2019re lucky to have young people of conscience and courage. And I suspect that deep down, we know they\u2019re right. We\u2019re just too proud to admit that we\u2019re hooked, in thrall to the pushers and dealers, the drillers and their shills. And few of us are as deeply ensnared as our elected representatives. That\u2019s not a tragedy \u2013 it\u2019s a scandal.</p> \n<p>But instead of owning our shame and frustration, and the rage we feel against those who make super profits from our misery, we project everything on to those trying to save us from ourselves.</p> \n<p>I believe we have the collective juice to break free of what oppresses us. But we\u2019ll need to do this together in new and unlikely alliances.</p> \n<p>That work is under way, despite the efforts of the big polluters. But finishing the job will require us to shed some rusted-on beliefs about what and who we value, about how we run our economy and who it\u2019s meant to benefit. Some unholy shibboleths need to be overturned.</p> \n<p>French theologian Jacques Ellul said: \u201cBelief is reassuring. People who live in the world of belief feel safe. On the contrary, faith is forever placing us on the razor\u2019s edge.\u201d</p> \n<p>With less than a decade in which to forestall the very worst of climate breakdown, that\u2019s where we are right now.</p> \n<p>The razor\u2019s edge is the terrain all morally serious humans must traverse in order to know themselves. Because the rim of oblivion is also the brink of opportunity and potential.</p> \n<p>So as we teeter together at the rim of eternity, consider the words of WH Auden: \u201cEternity is the decision <em>now,</em> action <em>now</em>, one\u2019s neighbour <em>here.\u201d</em></p> \n<p>\u2022 This is an edited excerpt from Tim Winton\u2019s 2024 <a href=\"https://www.publicchristianity.org/rjl2024/\">Richard Johnson lecture</a> for the <a href=\"https://www.publicchristianity.org/\" title=\"https://www.publicchristianity.org/\">Centre for Public Christianity</a>.</p>",

Because the chances that a child in the next century will feel gentle sunlight against her skin, or hear birdsong, or see native animals in the wild, or even live some part of the year outside of a storm shelter, will depend on the degree to which we can manifest fellow feeling for her now. To be a moral society, we need to rediscover and restore solidarity \u2013 with our Earth, and with its creatures and peoples. But solidarity is anathema to capitalism, especially the brute version that\u2019s spread and metastasized in the past 40 years. Fellow-feeling has been trained out of us. Two generations have been raised to fight a war of all against all, rendering us competitors and consumers when we could have been citizens and allies. To face the anguish and chaos of climate breakdown, which is the miserable legacy of fossil capitalism or business-as-usual, we\u2019ll need to skill up again and retrieve the best in ourselves. Only then do we stand a chance of not consigning our descendants to hell. I have no neat answer for how to revive solidarity. But I\u2019m certain it won\u2019t emerge from the pitiless dog-eat-dog mentality that got us into this crisis. Nor will it spring from those who revere convention, crave respectability and align themselves with the powerful against the weak. Moments of real human progress \u2013 from the abolition of slavery to the advent of workers\u2019 rights and the struggle for women\u2019s suffrage \u2013 have always sprung from empathy, vulnerability, imagination and disruption. From new concepts born in adversity. From fresh language that\u2019s honest and calls out injustice, emboldening resistance and inspiring courage. And in deeds that are audacious, selfless and unforeseen, even shocking. This is the stuff that draws us together and bears us up as one. Such words and deeds will be dangerous to the status quo, and there will be fear and rage in them. But for solidarity to endure, these must, in the end, be expressions of love, not of vengeance. Love isn\u2019t always gentle, though. For love makes. And it breaks. That\u2019s the price of commitment \u2013 for communities as much as for individuals. Positive change is hard. Transformations and transitions are messy, they require sacrifice \u2013 not from the weak and oppressed, but from the powerful and prideful. Under capitalism that will feel deeply discordant, but it\u2019s non-negotiable. Having spent so long insatiably gilding the present by looting the future, transformative change is our only hope. Naomi Klein says: \u201cIf we don\u2019t demand radical change we are headed for a whole world of people searching for a home that no longer exists.\u201d In other words, we will have expelled ourselves from Eden all over again. Pope Francis says that as a matter of urgency, we need to undergo \u201can ecological conversion\u201d. New and unlikely threads of solidarity have been emerging for a while. You may not know about them, but across generations, religions, races, classes and time zones, new alliances are forming every day. The Pope\u2019s \u201cecological conversion\u201d is afoot. Thirty years and several popes ago, Thomas Berry was busy laying some of the conceptual groundwork for it. A priest of the Passionist order, Berry described our dependency on fossil fuels as a global addiction. Addiction is a form of captivity and degradation. Getting off the gear is hard, and recovery is messy, but the allies you find on the way are deeply surprising. And they\u2019re life-changing. But before you hit rock bottom as an addict, you\u2019re in the grip of denial. There are so many lies you tell yourself and others. And, of course, while you suffer, there\u2019s always someone profiting from your illness. When you suspect someone has overdosed on an opiate, you find yourself walking them around while you wait for the ambulance. You shout at them, shake them, plead with them to stay awake, to stay with you. Now, think of all the scientific and activist voices who have been pleading with us over recent years to stay conscious. They\u2019ve done everything in their power to save us from sinking back into our deadly cultural and political stupor. Their efforts have been selfless and heroic. And yet we\u2019ve scorned them. At best, we patronise them. The American poet Christian Wiman writes that \u201cto attend is to atone\u201d. Think about that. Because right now, legions of young people are divesting themselves of our sad and lonely captivity to business as usual. And they\u2019re getting organised, networking, skilling up, raising their voices and literally placing their bodies in the path of those who profit from our addiction. Politicians castigate them. The media vilifies them. Yes, these young patriots can be awkward to contend with. They feel so vexatious and countercultural. All their banners and slogans. Their blockades slowing our commute. All those difficult questions they ask at shareholder meetings. And of course, the mortifying street theatre they insist on inflicting upon us. But what else can they do? Many of them can\u2019t even vote yet. They\u2019re trying what they can, snatching whatever fleeting opportunity is available to them in a polity that shuts them out at every point \u2013 financially, politically, culturally. But their voices are prophetic. Prophets speak truth to power \u2013 and we know what happens to prophets. To the mighty and comfortable, the truth is a threat. It must be intimidated, arrested, beaten, shot and, yes, crucified to produce the silence required to maintain business as usual. Prophets try to shake their communities awake. And that\u2019s all these kids are trying to do. Yes, they\u2019re right up in our faces, blocking our path, begging us not to sink back into cosy oblivion. Because they know what our junkie habit is doing to creation, to our home and to their future. If things don\u2019t change \u2013 and fast \u2013 they will be damned for our sins. And their sense of forsakenness is being ignored. But it\u2019s worse than that. Because now they\u2019re being persecuted on our watch, in our name and on our dime. By and large, we turn our heads and walk on by. Even those of us steeped in religious teachings urging us to defend the weak, the oppressed and the outcast. We\u2019re lucky to have young people of conscience and courage. And I suspect that deep down, we know they\u2019re right. We\u2019re just too proud to admit that we\u2019re hooked, in thrall to the pushers and dealers, the drillers and their shills. And few of us are as deeply ensnared as our elected representatives. That\u2019s not a tragedy \u2013 it\u2019s a scandal. But instead of owning our shame and frustration, and the rage we feel against those who make super profits from our misery, we project everything on to those trying to save us from ourselves. I believe we have the collective juice to break free of what oppresses us. But we\u2019ll need to do this together in new and unlikely alliances. That work is under way, despite the efforts of the big polluters. But finishing the job will require us to shed some rusted-on beliefs about what and who we value, about how we run our economy and who it\u2019s meant to benefit. Some unholy shibboleths need to be overturned. French theologian Jacques Ellul said: \u201cBelief is reassuring. People who live in the world of belief feel safe. On the contrary, faith is forever placing us on the razor\u2019s edge.\u201d With less than a decade in which to forestall the very worst of climate breakdown, that\u2019s where we are right now. The razor\u2019s edge is the terrain all morally serious humans must traverse in order to know themselves. Because the rim of oblivion is also the brink of opportunity and potential. So as we teeter together at the rim of eternity, consider the words of WH Auden: \u201cEternity is the decision now, action now, one\u2019s neighbour here.\u201d \u2022 This is an edited excerpt from Tim Winton\u2019s 2024 Richard Johnson lecture for the Centre for Public Christianity.",

      "bodyText": "It may be some way off being loved again, and the ghosts of its tumultuous era may still linger, but the past year appears to have made a world of difference for Qantas\u2019 revival \u2013 in the eyes of investors. Shareholders who attended its annual general meeting in Hobart on Friday were in a markedly better mood than this time last year, with its share price up by more than 60% to trade just above the $8 mark. One year ago, as Australia\u2019s biggest airline emerged from pandemic disruptions to post record multibillion-dollar profits, shareholders delivered one of Australia\u2019s largest-ever protest votes against executive pay, amid fury at a cascading string of scandals that precipitated the early retirement of its long-term chief executive Alan Joyce. At the 2023 AGM in Melbourne, the company\u2019s executive pay deal was overwhelmingly rejected, with 83% of votes cast against, setting up the prospect of a vote to spill the airline\u2019s board of directors if the remuneration plans were voted down again the following year. However, in Hobart on Friday, the 75% threshold of support was reached comfortably, which meant Qantas avoided a potential board spill. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cThe shareholders can\u2019t complain \u2013 sure they might get lower dividends, but it\u2019s a phenomenal rise [in share price],\u201d said Tony Webber, the chief executive of the industry analyst firm Airline Intelligence &amp; Research and a former chief economist at Qantas. \u201cTheir financials are clearly better, but they\u2019ve achieved this by pissing off a lot of people \u2026 It\u2019s still an active task to win back its reputation,\u201d Webber said. \u2018The ghost of Alan Joyce\u2019 While investors\u2019 appeared pleased with Qantas\u2019 recent trajectory \u2013 aside from some complaints about the airline not paying dividends \u2013 the shadow of last year\u2019s feisty AGM, in which former chair Richard Goyder was heckled, was never far off. During questions on Friday, investors asked how severe the impact of the airline\u2019s settlement with the consumer regulator \u2013 in which it will pay $100m in penalties and $20m in compensation for selling thousands of tickets for flights that it had already cancelled in its systems \u2013 would be. They also raised questions about the hefty compensation bill for its decision to illegally sack almost 1,700 baggage handlers in 2020. Test case compensation amounts, determined by the federal court earlier this week, mean Qantas\u2019 financial hit over this saga is now expected to exceed $100m, in addition to any court-imposed penalty. There were reminders of the fiery scenes of last year. Investors had been limited to two questions each, but shareholder Chris Maxworthy made the case that he should be allowed to ask a third, because at last year\u2019s AGM Goyder ordered his microphone be turned off. \u201cI feel the ghost of Alan Joyce in the room,\u201d Maxworthy said. In response to a handful of tense questions, the new chair of Qantas, John Mullen, often answered on behalf of fellow board members, in some cases protecting them from irate questioners who demanded certain directors speak for themselves. Mullen also defended against a suggestion from an investor that Joyce\u2019s final pay packet \u2013 a $21.4m package which had already been cut by $9.3m following a governance review which found considerable harm was done to the Qantas brand under his tenure \u2013 should be clawed back even further to just his base salary. Brand repair ongoing Mullen appeared to arrive at Friday\u2019s AGM knowing that while the share price may be booming, optics were another thing. \u201cThere is no pretending that last year was anything other than a very difficult year for Qantas,\u201d he said in his opening address. \u201cYou have our absolute commitment to learn from the past, correct mistakes quickly and ethically if they occur and ensure that we earn the trust and respect of all of our stakeholders, from government to customers to employees and to everyday Australians,\u201d Mullen said. Despite Mullen\u2019s contrition over the decision to outsource ground handling, Webber, the former Qantas chief economist, thought the pain could have been worth it from a financial perspective alone. \u201cIt is probably saving them money still overall,\u201d Webber said. The Australian Shareholders\u2019 Association was against a board spill, citing the considerable change at the board level over the past year. Its chief executive, Rachel Waterhouse, believed Qantas\u2019 decision to commission the governance report into what went wrong at the airline was prudent, but said it was too early to tell if that will bring about substantial change. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a good job of having an independent review and throwing it out there for everyone to see, warts and all,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, there\u2019s a tick there but unfortunately they had to do it because of all the problems. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to know for sure whether everything is on the right track, but they have a very solid, experienced chair in there now,\u201d Waterhouse said. Qantas\u2019 governance review, released in August, found that there was \u201ctoo much deference\u201d by the board to Joyce, who the report notes had overcome multiple past operational and financial crises. The report also noted a lack of board focus on non-financial issues, employees and customers. Progress on this front appears less advanced. Research from polling company Roy Morgan found that Qantas\u2019 reputation continued to slide in the June quarter, moving further up its distrust rankings. It is now the second-most distrusted brand in Australia, overtaking Facebook\u2019s parent Meta. While Qantas\u2019 internal research conflicts with this and shows a slight improvement in its reputation, Webber said the legacy of Joyce\u2019s decisions in areas such as fleet renewal \u2013 where he claims Joyce neglected refreshing aircraft to achieve short-term financial goals \u2013 mean that customers are still flying on comparatively older planes which are more prone to issues that lead to disruptions. While new aircraft deliveries are set to pick up over the next year for Qantas, he stressed it was important for Qantas not to rest on decent financial performances and continue tangible improvements for customers. Waterhouse agreed Qantas still needed to be watched closely and despite the rising share price, there are bigger issues to grapple with. \u201cCulture and change takes time,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reality is there\u2019s just so many costs there and there\u2019s still a lot of challenges. \u201cIt\u2019s going in the right direction but you wouldn\u2019t want to get too excited just yet.\u201d",

The Tigers\u2019 response was immediate, however. A clever grubber from the fledgling centre Joe Woodward was measured perfectly for Ollie Hassell-Collins to gather and dot down before Perese was over for Leicester\u2019s second try on the left after excellent work by Anthony Watson, who claimed a high ball and made significant ground on the right.</p> \n<p>Back came Saracens to within a point when Swiel popped up on the shoulder of Juan Mart\u00edn Gonz\u00e1lez, who had made the crucial break before the fly-half\u2019s penalty edged his side ahead.</p> \n<p>Leicester responded again to take the lead into the interval with a penalty try on the stroke of half-time \u2013 the Saracens tighthead prop Alec Clarey shown a yellow card for his troubles. It got better for the Tigers when the captain Juli\u00e1n Montoya notched their fourth from a driving maul \u2013 Perese doing the initial damage with a fine burst up the middle.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you\u2019re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Another Pollard penalty left Saracens needing three scores with a quarter of the match to go, which became two when Gonz\u00e1lez dotted down from close range.

It meant a start for Tim Swiel, who joined the club this week as short-term cover, and as Mark McCall revealed afterwards, did not know what the calls his teammates were making even meant. \u201cIt\u2019s not a great situation but he managed his way through the game and I thought he did really well,\u201d said McCall. \u201cThere\u2019s a good way to lose and a bad way to lose and that was one of the better ways.\u201d Leicester opened the scoring with a straightforward penalty from Handr\u00e8 Pollard but it was Saracens who registered the first try of the match, finished by Nick Tompkins but owing everything to Willis\u2019s bulldozing ball-carrying. The Tigers\u2019 response was immediate, however. A clever grubber from the fledgling centre Joe Woodward was measured perfectly for Ollie Hassell-Collins to gather and dot down before Perese was over for Leicester\u2019s second try on the left after excellent work by Anthony Watson, who claimed a high ball and made significant ground on the right. Back came Saracens to within a point when Swiel popped up on the shoulder of Juan Mart\u00edn Gonz\u00e1lez, who had made the crucial break before the fly-half\u2019s penalty edged his side ahead. Leicester responded again to take the lead into the interval with a penalty try on the stroke of half-time \u2013 the Saracens tighthead prop Alec Clarey shown a yellow card for his troubles. It got better for the Tigers when the captain Juli\u00e1n Montoya notched their fourth from a driving maul \u2013 Perese doing the initial damage with a fine burst up the middle. Another Pollard penalty left Saracens needing three scores with a quarter of the match to go, which became two when Gonz\u00e1lez dotted down from close range. Again Willis was the provider \u2013 a thundering run up the guts of Leicester\u2019s defence just as Saracens were running out of ideas. Asked if Willis can consider himself unlucky to be out of the England picture, McCall said: \u201cI think so, he\u2019s been outstanding in every game this year, eye-catching in every game this year.\u201d It was one score with nine minutes to go when the replacement hooker James Hadfield squeezed the ball down after a driving maul had been held short but whereas the last-gasp turnaround was forthcoming for Saracens at Bristol last week, Leicester held firm for all five points.",

      "body": "<p>Fury and shock ripped through liberal America over the weekend after news that the <em>Washington Post</em>, home of the Watergate scandal expos\u00e9, the paper that ran the Pentagon Papers, will not now endorse Kamala Harris for president. But angry responses were quickly replaced by two pressing questions: how did it happen, and how could readers best protest?</p> <p>At the centre of the storm is William Lewis, the British \u00adnewspaperman who became <em>Washington Post</em> publisher and CEO in January. The 55-year-old north Londoner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/25/washington-post-endorsement-president-election\">broke the decision to staff on Friday</a> couched in terms that evoked the title\u2019s traditions.</p> <p>The newspaper, he said, was just moving back to its roots in \u00addeclining to back a presidential candidate. This was a return to the convention of non-endorsement the <em>Post</em> gave up 48 years ago to support the Democrat Jimmy Carter. \u201cWe had it right before that, and this is what we are going back to,\u201d said Lewis.</p> <p>Among early public reactions was a call to unsubscribe that quickly became a social media trend #CancelWaPo, alongside a string of attacks on the failure to take a stand against Donald Trump, including from comedian Steve Martin, actor Mark Hamill and the Watergate \u00adjournalists, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.</p> <p>Woodward and Bernstein, whose Watergate \u00adreporting and subsequent book were the basis for the award-winning film <em>All the President\u2019s Men</em>, said: \u201cThis decision 11 days out from the 2024 presidential election ignores the <em>Washington Post</em>\u2019s own overwhelming reportorial \u00adevidence on the threat Donald Trump poses to democracy. </p> <p>\u201cUnder Jeff Bezos\u2019s ownership, the <em>Washington Post</em>\u2019s news \u00adoperation has used its abundant resources to rigorously investigate the danger a second Trump \u00adpresidency could cause to the future of American democracy and that makes this \u00addecision even more surprising and&nbsp;disappointing, especially this late in the electoral process.\u201d</p> <p>The newspaper\u2019s editor-at-large, Robert Kagan, resigned on Friday. Last year he wrote a column headlined: \u201cThe Trump dictatorship: How to stop it\u201d, and he has also argued that the former president could \u201cdestroy\u201d democracy if re-elected.</p>    <p>Cartoon-page editors at the <em>Washington Post</em> got their revenge on Saturday, putting out a dark, streaked image by the Pulitzer Prize-winning illustrator Ann Telnaes. The gloomy picture was called \u201cDemocracy dies in darkness\u201d, the paper\u2019s own Trump-era slogan. Bezos, who is understood to have refused the paper\u2019s editorial board the freedom to make a political endorsement, has not commented.</p> <p>\u201cThe timing of the <em>Post</em> endorsement decision looks craven and undermines the very independence it purports to defend,\u201d said Marcus Brauchli, who edited the paper from 2008 to 2012. \u201cThis is a terrible own-goal,\u201d Brauchli added. \u201cThere are perfectly good reasons a newspaper might give for not endorsing a \u00adpresidential candidate. The <em>Post</em> didn\u2019t offer any, and its timing was awful and looks, whatever the reasoning, gutless or craven.\u201d</p> <p>An editor at the paper told the<a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/political_press/the-washington-post-opinion-editor-approved-a-harris-endorsement-a-week-later-the-papers-publisher-killed-it.php\"> <em>Columbia Journalism Review</em> </a>the editorial work around an endorsement was on track as recently as a week ago. \u201cWe thought we were dickering over language \u2013 not over whether there would be an endorsement,\u201d the <em>Post</em> staffer said. </p> <p>The decision, the <em>Review</em> noted, \u201cseems to us, is what Timothy Snyder, professor of history at Yale University, calls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/26/anticipatory-obedience-newspapers-endorsement-refusal\">\u2018anticipatory obedience\u2019.\u201d</a> The phrase describes, in Snyder\u2019s words, \u201calready giving over your power to the aspiring authoritarian\u201d. </p> <p>It follows a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/25/los-angeles-times-owner-blocks-harris-endorsement\">decision earlier in the week by the <em>Los Angeles Times</em></a>, not to endorse a candidate, which caused several editorial board members to step down. Nika Soon-Shiong, the daughter of the<em> </em>owner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/oct/25/patrick-soon-shiong-the-billionaire-la-times-owner-who-blocked-harris-endorsement\">Patrick Soon-Shiong</a>, a biotech billionaire, said on social media that the decision not to endorse Harris was down to the Democratic candidate\u2019s position on the war in Gaza. </p> <p>She wrote that her father, a South African transplant surgeon, had worked as an emergency surgeon in Soweto hospital during apartheid. \u201cFor my family, Apartheid is not a vague concept.\u201d Maintaining that the decision to endorse was one made by the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> editorial board, Soon-Shiong added: \u201cThis is not a vote for Donald Trump. This is a refusal to ENDORSE a candidate that is overseeing a war on children.\u201d.</p> <p>The tradition of an endorsement goes back to the era&nbsp;when titles were formally attached to political parties, says Bob Thompson, media professor at Syracuse University. </p> <p>\u201cIt does seem odd that newspapers are seemingly \u00adproviding objective reportage then stepping back and having the editorial page and the paper itself make an endorsement.

      "bodyText": "Fury and shock ripped through liberal America over the weekend after news that the Washington Post, home of the Watergate scandal expos\u00e9, the paper that ran the Pentagon Papers, will not now endorse Kamala Harris for president. But angry responses were quickly replaced by two pressing questions: how did it happen, and how could readers best protest? At the centre of the storm is William Lewis, the British newspaperman who became Washington Post publisher and CEO in January. The 55-year-old north Londoner broke the decision to staff on Friday couched in terms that evoked the title\u2019s traditions. The newspaper, he said, was just moving back to its roots in declining to back a presidential candidate. This was a return to the convention of non-endorsement the Post gave up 48 years ago to support the Democrat Jimmy Carter. \u201cWe had it right before that, and this is what we are going back to,\u201d said Lewis. Among early public reactions was a call to unsubscribe that quickly became a social media trend #CancelWaPo, alongside a string of attacks on the failure to take a stand against Donald Trump, including from comedian Steve Martin, actor Mark Hamill and the Watergate journalists, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. Woodward and Bernstein, whose Watergate reporting and subsequent book were the basis for the award-winning film All the President\u2019s Men, said: \u201cThis decision 11 days out from the 2024 presidential election ignores the Washington Post\u2019s own overwhelming reportorial evidence on the threat Donald Trump poses to democracy. \u201cUnder Jeff Bezos\u2019s ownership, the Washington Post\u2019s news operation has used its abundant resources to rigorously investigate the danger a second Trump presidency could cause to the future of American democracy and that makes this decision even more surprising and disappointing, especially this late in the electoral process.\u201d The newspaper\u2019s editor-at-large, Robert Kagan, resigned on Friday. Last year he wrote a column headlined: \u201cThe Trump dictatorship: How to stop it\u201d, and he has also argued that the former president could \u201cdestroy\u201d democracy if re-elected. Cartoon-page editors at the Washington Post got their revenge on Saturday, putting out a dark, streaked image by the Pulitzer Prize-winning illustrator Ann Telnaes. The gloomy picture was called \u201cDemocracy dies in darkness\u201d, the paper\u2019s own Trump-era slogan. Bezos, who is understood to have refused the paper\u2019s editorial board the freedom to make a political endorsement, has not commented. \u201cThe timing of the Post endorsement decision looks craven and undermines the very independence it purports to defend,\u201d said Marcus Brauchli, who edited the paper from 2008 to 2012. \u201cThis is a terrible own-goal,\u201d Brauchli added. \u201cThere are perfectly good reasons a newspaper might give for not endorsing a presidential candidate. The Post didn\u2019t offer any, and its timing was awful and looks, whatever the reasoning, gutless or craven.\u201d An editor at the paper told the Columbia Journalism Review the editorial work around an endorsement was on track as recently as a week ago. \u201cWe thought we were dickering over language \u2013 not over whether there would be an endorsement,\u201d the Post staffer said. The decision, the Review noted, \u201cseems to us, is what Timothy Snyder, professor of history at Yale University, calls \u2018anticipatory obedience\u2019.\u201d The phrase describes, in Snyder\u2019s words, \u201calready giving over your power to the aspiring authoritarian\u201d. It follows a decision earlier in the week by the Los Angeles Times, not to endorse a candidate, which caused several editorial board members to step down. Nika Soon-Shiong, the daughter of the owner Patrick Soon-Shiong, a biotech billionaire, said on social media that the decision not to endorse Harris was down to the Democratic candidate\u2019s position on the war in Gaza. She wrote that her father, a South African transplant surgeon, had worked as an emergency surgeon in Soweto hospital during apartheid. \u201cFor my family, Apartheid is not a vague concept.\u201d Maintaining that the decision to endorse was one made by the Los Angeles Times editorial board, Soon-Shiong added: \u201cThis is not a vote for Donald Trump. This is a refusal to ENDORSE a candidate that is overseeing a war on children.\u201d. The tradition of an endorsement goes back to the era when titles were formally attached to political parties, says Bob Thompson, media professor at Syracuse University. \u201cIt does seem odd that newspapers are seemingly providing objective reportage then stepping back and having the editorial page and the paper itself make an endorsement. Television doesn\u2019t do it. The question is: why is it this particular election?\u201d The closing days of this election are marked by increasing bitterness and pre-emptive political recrimination. This weekend, many American commentators are pointing straight at Bezos, the Amazon billionaire owner of the Washington Post since the summer of 2013. He, it is argued, now suspects that Trump may win on 5 November and that he might take presidential-scale revenge on Bezos and Amazon\u2019s business ventures. While Bezos, not Amazon, owns the newspaper, Amazon is a significant government contractor. In 2021, the US government announced the creation of the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability contract with Amazon Web Services, the most reliably profitable sector of the company. The defense department deal with AWS, the government said, was \u201cdesigned to make cloud services and capabilities available at all classification levels and across all security domains\u201d and \u201ckey to enabling critical warfighter capabilities.\u201d Lewis made the paper\u2019s position clear in an opinion piece saying that it was \u201cconsistent with the values the Post has always stood for\u201d. He wrote: \u201cCharacter and courage in service to the American ethic, veneration for the rule of law, and respect for human freedom in all its aspects. We also see it as a statement in support of our readers\u2019 ability to make up their own minds on this, the most consequential of American decisions \u2013 whom to vote for as the next president.\u201d Lewis, who was knighted on the recommendation of his former political boss, Boris Johnson, is a former editor of the Daily Telegraph, and previously spent six years in New York as publisher of the Wall Street Journal. On arrival at the Post, he inherited its first female executive editor, Sally Buzbee, but she stepped down a few months later, in June. She is believed to have objected to her new boss\u2019s attempts to kill a story about his involvement in the aftermath of the newspaper hacking scandal in Britain. When he was put in charge of the company, Lewis said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to expand. We\u2019re going to get our swagger back.\u201d",

Thousands of Robinson followers were divided from a counter-protest of Stand Up to Racism supporters by barriers, stages and lines of police officers. Between them was the United Families and Friends Campaign (UFFC), made up of relatives of people who have died in police custody. Five family members, including a cousin of Chris Kaba, delivered a handwritten note for Keir Starmer to Downing Street after hundreds had walked from Trafalgar Square. Police made three arrests. The Metropolitan police said there had been a \u201cbrief period of pushing and shoving\u201d near the Stand Up to Racism stage and that an officer had been assaulted when \u201ca group from the Stand Up to Racism demonstration tried to push through a cordon at the end of the Mall\u201d. The other arrests were for a racially aggravated public order offence and for breach of the peace at the Uniting the Kingdom demonstration in support of Robinson, the English Defence League founder who was in custody after being arrested on Friday. The 41-year-old, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is accused of being in contempt of court after the airing of a film at a protest in Trafalgar Square in July. He went to Folkestone police station on Friday, where he was remanded before a hearing at Woolwich crown court on Monday concerning allegations that he breached a 2021 high court order barring him from repeating libellous allegations against a Syrian refugee who successfully sued him. Robinson was separately charged on Friday with failing to provide his mobile phone access code to police under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, Kent police said. The campaign group Hope Not Hate estimated that 15,000 to 20,000 people joined the Uniting the Kingdom demonstration on Saturday. Robinson has recently focused on Peter Lynch, a 61-year-old who died in prison this month having pleaded guilty to violent disorder at the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham during the riots in August. Lynch, who had four children and three grandchildren, had yelled \u201cscum\u201d and \u201cchild killers\u201d at police and was seen holding a placard accusing judges, the World Health Organization and Nasa of corruption. Some at the Uniting the Kingdom protest wore T-shirts or carried placards saying \u201cI am Peter Lynch\u201d. After arriving at Parliament Square, supporters stayed to watch a screening of a new documentary by Robinson, which took the place of a stump speech.

Kaba was shot dead by firearms officer Martyn Blake in 2022 when police tried to stop his car; the officer in question was acquitted of murder last week. It was also reported last week that Kaba had been captured on CCTV days before shooting a man on a nightclub dancefloor. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, tried to calm police anger that Blake had been put on trial by pledging that firearms officers\u2019 identities would be protected if they are prosecuted, unless they are convicted.

      "bodyText": "Pep Guardiola said he is happy to lead from the front after Manchester City\u2019s 1-0 win over Southampton at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday gave the champions top spot in the Premier League table for 24 hours at least. City lead Liverpool by two points but they can be overhauled at the summit should Arne Slot\u2019s side win at Arsenal in Sunday\u2019s late match. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have 23 points now,\u201d the City manager said: \u201cI will watch [Arsenal play Liverpool]. I prefer to be top than not top. \u201cVilla drop points, Brighton drop points. It is so difficult. We won at Wolves in 95 mins. Today we had chances. Expected goals much higher. Today was such a demanding game for us.\u201d Erling Haaland\u2019s 14th goal of the season, scored in the fifth minute, secured victory against a defiant Saints. \u201cMany times this happens \u2013 not the first time thanks to Erling we win,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cHe scores the most to win the game for us.\u201d Southampton are bottom with one point but Guardiola believes he can learn from the patient approach of their manager, Russell Martin. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer in the process of the build up [play],\u201d he said. \u201cI prefer my players to get the ball to their feet, not teeth. We were not sloppy \u2013 we struggled to get the ball because they are really good. \u201cI\u2019m a spectator first. I like to see the opponent do things I like. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll learn the movements \u2013 why they do it, to link to the striker, players on the side. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, we create enough chances to win by more. But Wolves [last week] and now Southampton: I like to win in that way. \u201cIn the Premier League everyone can beat everyone, that is the truth. Every game is a battle. When the opponent is good you have to accept it.\u201d Martin will serve a touchline ban for Stoke\u2019s EFL Cup visit on Tuesday after receiving a third yellow card of the season for protesting at Flynn Downes\u2019s booking by Tony Harrington for his challenge on Bernardo Silva. Martin said: \u201cI don\u2019t really speak about [referee\u2019s decisions] but I am going to miss next week\u2019s game for throwing my arms up at a bad decision. I didn\u2019t swear at the fourth official. \u201cIf I am wrong and deserve a yellow card then I hold my hands up but I think that\u2019s nonsense.

In her first budget she will spell out plans to raise an eye-watering sum of about \u00a340bn from tax rises and spending reductions to wipe the slate clean and to pump funds into public services. She will also confirm changes to debt rules that will release up to \u00a350bn more to borrow for long-term investment in new national infrastructure.</p> <p>In terms of raising immediate day-to-day spending, the chancellor\u2019s problem is that promises were made to voters in before the election that, if honoured, would severely restrict her options.

      "body": "<p>When the old guard told us we were brave to start a political party, hardly anyone meant that as a compliment. Perhaps it is naive to believe in the possibility of a better future, but inequality was yawning ever wider, with women and girls at the sharp end. Frankly, setting up the <a href=\"https://www.womensequality.org.uk/\">Women\u2019s Equality party</a> (WE) wasn\u2019t so much brave as a no-brainer.</p> <p>Why not simply join a mainstream party or use our media platforms to campaign? Well, we saw old parties adopting the rhetoric of populism to woo voters, while editors platformed toxic views in the name of balance, and clickbait-hungry broadcasters turned dangerous buffoons into reality stars.</p> <p>For almost a decade, WE thrived, offering transformative solutions and making a real difference, not because of our own efforts but thanks to the thousands of brilliant people who picked up the idea and ran with it. Just this May, <a href=\"https://www.basingstokegazette.co.uk/news/24298018.first-womens-equality-party-borough-councillor-elected-basingstoke/\">Stacy Hart won a seat</a> on Basingstoke borough council, trouncing the Tory incumbent and securing 59% of the vote. She joined a growing band of WE councillors including our first elected representative, Kay Wesley in Congleton, already re-elected for a second term.</p> <p>Each of these women models how much political upstarts can achieve. Despite this, we have come to the reluctant conclusion that this beloved organisation, part movement, part community, passionate and extraordinary, has run its course. At November\u2019s special conference, we will back a motion proposing its closure.</p> <p>We reached this decision after much soul-searching and against the pleadings of our own hearts. WE\u2019s executive and steering committees have been examining options, and we both initially gravitated towards ideas that would preserve the party, keenly aware of the implications for staff, volunteers, members, supporters, elected representatives and voters.</p> <p>Whatever conference decides, our immediate concern is to ensure that not a single activist takes this discussion as a deterrent to ambition. WE\u2019s history carries exactly the opposite message, a prompt to action on as grand a scale as possible. If one small, but mighty party can do so much, what could not be achieved with more resources?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>WE showcased a different route to winning, fielding survivors of violence to stand against five MPs facing unresolved allegations of abuse and harassment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Money has always been a problem, with most of the party\u2019s income coming from members who were already cash-strapped before the one-two punch of the pandemic and cost of living crisis. Unlike other parties, we have never received large donations from corporates or super-rich individuals. In fact, in the early days of the party we turned down a gamechanging sum after the potential donor explained the strings attached: we would have to change the name of the party. Yep, ditch \u201cWomen\u201d. Thanks, but no thanks.</p> <p>If funding were the only issue, we would almost certainly advocate for keeping going. But business as usual is not an option. The world has changed and so we are calling for an end as a new beginning.</p> <p>Let us explain.</p> <p>Our founding idea was simple: if we could show there were votes in feminism, the old parties would attempt to neutralise us by mimicking us, just as we had seen them do with Ukip and its successors.</p> <p>The ploy worked. WE racked up a whacking number of votes in our very first election, triggering the anticipated response. From then on, WE delivered each of our successive manifestos to other parties with a label reading \u201cplease steal us\u201d, and they did. They put up women against us, too, and echoed our positions on vital subjects they had previously ignored. As a result, wherever WE ran, WE won.</p> <p>Winning seats is, of course, the main change mechanism for traditional political parties. Despite direct victories, we never expected to make much of a dent that way. First-past-the-post elections most sharply disadvantage exactly those people whose voices are lacking in politics, marginalised women and minorities. At the 2019 general election, WE showcased a different route to winning, fielding survivors of violence to stand against five MPs facing unresolved allegations of abuse and harassment. Not one of those MPs returned to parliament. Which other parties do you know that can boast an electoral clean sweep?</p> <p>This proud record sits alongside WE\u2019s substantial contribution to grassroots campaigning on reproductive rights, tackling misogyny and racism in the police and other institutions, and spotlighting discrimination in its many forms including sexual harassment and the gender pay gap. WE held a members\u2019 assembly to try to shed light and diminish heat in the fight between trans inclusive and gender critical feminism that is weakening the women\u2019s movement to the delight of regressive populists. This list represents just a tiny fraction of the party\u2019s positive impacts and legacy.</p> <p>Perhaps WE\u2019s greatest contribution \u2013 and most enduring change mechanism \u2013 has been to bring exceptionally talented people into politics. Within a few short years of the wonderful Mandu Reid attending her first meeting, she became the first woman of colour ever to helm a UK political party. As Zoe Williams recently observed in the <em>Guardian</em>: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/18/sane-world-sandi-toksvig-politician-nigel-farage-entertainer\">in a world with rational priorities, she would be a much bigger household name.</a>\u201d</p> <p>Other parties have been quick to notice, recruiting former WE candidates with promises of safer seats. As a result, our candidates can find themselves contesting seats alongside sisters-in-arms who wear the colours of another party but were or are WE members.</p> <p>UK politics operates as a club. WE have always aimed to open doors, rather than pull up drawbridges. That is why WE are the only party to extend membership to members of other parties, and sometimes endorse their candidates in return for them embracing our policies. WE have worked particularly closely with the Green party, helping to draft a cross-party bill, and exploring a range of collaborative models from joint candidacies up to a permanent alliance. Climate change is gendered in its causes and its outcomes. At the general election earlier this year, WE <a href=\"https://sianberry.org.uk/2024/06/20/the-womens-equality-party-endorses-sian-as-candidate-in-brighton-pavilion/\">endorsed the Green\u2019s Si\u00e2n Berry</a>, and unveiled a joint policy platform, <em>A New Deal for Care</em>. She in turn won a seat in parliament promising to champion our flagship universal free childcare policy.</p>    <p>It even used to be possible to work with those Conservatives who regarded gender inequality and climate change as urgent issues rather than fodder for culture wars. As recently as Theresa May\u2019s premiership, one of her chief advisers called us to Downing Street to discuss which WE policies the government might incorporate in its legislative programme. Now we operate in a political landscape where the Tories\u2019 attempts to contain the electoral threat from the hard right has instead seen them fully captured by it.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour has also veered to the right, fixated on discipline, both fiscal and within its own ranks. The leadership barely listens to its MPs and wider membership, so it is hardly likely to pay heed to us. Nor would they be tempted by our policies.

      "bodyText": "When the old guard told us we were brave to start a political party, hardly anyone meant that as a compliment. Perhaps it is naive to believe in the possibility of a better future, but inequality was yawning ever wider, with women and girls at the sharp end. Frankly, setting up the Women\u2019s Equality party (WE) wasn\u2019t so much brave as a no-brainer. Why not simply join a mainstream party or use our media platforms to campaign? Well, we saw old parties adopting the rhetoric of populism to woo voters, while editors platformed toxic views in the name of balance, and clickbait-hungry broadcasters turned dangerous buffoons into reality stars. For almost a decade, WE thrived, offering transformative solutions and making a real difference, not because of our own efforts but thanks to the thousands of brilliant people who picked up the idea and ran with it. Just this May, Stacy Hart won a seat on Basingstoke borough council, trouncing the Tory incumbent and securing 59% of the vote. She joined a growing band of WE councillors including our first elected representative, Kay Wesley in Congleton, already re-elected for a second term. Each of these women models how much political upstarts can achieve. Despite this, we have come to the reluctant conclusion that this beloved organisation, part movement, part community, passionate and extraordinary, has run its course. At November\u2019s special conference, we will back a motion proposing its closure. We reached this decision after much soul-searching and against the pleadings of our own hearts. WE\u2019s executive and steering committees have been examining options, and we both initially gravitated towards ideas that would preserve the party, keenly aware of the implications for staff, volunteers, members, supporters, elected representatives and voters. Whatever conference decides, our immediate concern is to ensure that not a single activist takes this discussion as a deterrent to ambition. WE\u2019s history carries exactly the opposite message, a prompt to action on as grand a scale as possible. If one small, but mighty party can do so much, what could not be achieved with more resources? Money has always been a problem, with most of the party\u2019s income coming from members who were already cash-strapped before the one-two punch of the pandemic and cost of living crisis. Unlike other parties, we have never received large donations from corporates or super-rich individuals. In fact, in the early days of the party we turned down a gamechanging sum after the potential donor explained the strings attached: we would have to change the name of the party. Yep, ditch \u201cWomen\u201d. Thanks, but no thanks. If funding were the only issue, we would almost certainly advocate for keeping going. But business as usual is not an option. The world has changed and so we are calling for an end as a new beginning. Let us explain. Our founding idea was simple: if we could show there were votes in feminism, the old parties would attempt to neutralise us by mimicking us, just as we had seen them do with Ukip and its successors. The ploy worked. WE racked up a whacking number of votes in our very first election, triggering the anticipated response. From then on, WE delivered each of our successive manifestos to other parties with a label reading \u201cplease steal us\u201d, and they did. They put up women against us, too, and echoed our positions on vital subjects they had previously ignored. As a result, wherever WE ran, WE won. Winning seats is, of course, the main change mechanism for traditional political parties. Despite direct victories, we never expected to make much of a dent that way. First-past-the-post elections most sharply disadvantage exactly those people whose voices are lacking in politics, marginalised women and minorities. At the 2019 general election, WE showcased a different route to winning, fielding survivors of violence to stand against five MPs facing unresolved allegations of abuse and harassment. Not one of those MPs returned to parliament. Which other parties do you know that can boast an electoral clean sweep? This proud record sits alongside WE\u2019s substantial contribution to grassroots campaigning on reproductive rights, tackling misogyny and racism in the police and other institutions, and spotlighting discrimination in its many forms including sexual harassment and the gender pay gap. WE held a members\u2019 assembly to try to shed light and diminish heat in the fight between trans inclusive and gender critical feminism that is weakening the women\u2019s movement to the delight of regressive populists. This list represents just a tiny fraction of the party\u2019s positive impacts and legacy. Perhaps WE\u2019s greatest contribution \u2013 and most enduring change mechanism \u2013 has been to bring exceptionally talented people into politics. Within a few short years of the wonderful Mandu Reid attending her first meeting, she became the first woman of colour ever to helm a UK political party. As Zoe Williams recently observed in the Guardian: \u201cin a world with rational priorities, she would be a much bigger household name.\u201d Other parties have been quick to notice, recruiting former WE candidates with promises of safer seats. As a result, our candidates can find themselves contesting seats alongside sisters-in-arms who wear the colours of another party but were or are WE members. UK politics operates as a club. WE have always aimed to open doors, rather than pull up drawbridges. That is why WE are the only party to extend membership to members of other parties, and sometimes endorse their candidates in return for them embracing our policies. WE have worked particularly closely with the Green party, helping to draft a cross-party bill, and exploring a range of collaborative models from joint candidacies up to a permanent alliance. Climate change is gendered in its causes and its outcomes. At the general election earlier this year, WE endorsed the Green\u2019s Si\u00e2n Berry, and unveiled a joint policy platform, A New Deal for Care. She in turn won a seat in parliament promising to champion our flagship universal free childcare policy. It even used to be possible to work with those Conservatives who regarded gender inequality and climate change as urgent issues rather than fodder for culture wars. As recently as Theresa May\u2019s premiership, one of her chief advisers called us to Downing Street to discuss which WE policies the government might incorporate in its legislative programme. Now we operate in a political landscape where the Tories\u2019 attempts to contain the electoral threat from the hard right has instead seen them fully captured by it. Meanwhile, Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour has also veered to the right, fixated on discipline, both fiscal and within its own ranks. The leadership barely listens to its MPs and wider membership, so it is hardly likely to pay heed to us. Nor would they be tempted by our policies. WE view care as an investment; they see it as an expense that can be cut. All of this means that merely tweaking our approach cannot be enough, and this isn\u2019t just about WE. The last Westminster election might have looked like a return to safer ground, just as the 2020 US presidential contest did, but such results are misleading. In many countries, populism and tech-driven polarisation are winning, to the benefit of the far right and other extremists, dictators and repressive regimes around the globe. We must do more, not less, to confront the storm. Far from giving up the fight for equality, the two of us, like many other activists, are hard at work on ways to gear it up, to regroup, renew, and return, roaring. And if the conference decides that the Women\u2019s Equality party is no longer the most effective vehicle for change, we know that its energy, inspiration, knowledge and, above all, its people are more than capable of leading a new charge. \u2022 Catherine Mayer and Sandi Toksvig are co-founders of the Women\u2019s Equality party",

Confounding criticism that she speaks in \u201cword salads\u201d, she bested Trump in their only live TV debate, to the extent he declined a return bout. Harris seems to have the happy knack of connecting on a personal level with people she meets.

Nor is she charismatic like Barack Obama. Her national <a href=\"https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/trump-harris-approval-ratings-lowest-68-years-poll\">approval ratings are historically low</a>.

This is the crux around which the election turns. American voters may think they have a choice. But if they value their democracy, if they value their laws, institutions and constitution, if they value personal liberty, their country\u2019s safety and international peace and security, indeed if they hope ever to vote again, then they really do not. The only choice is Harris.</p> <h2 data-note-id=\"b8d4dde3-6fcf-424e-8ba3-56c9d2b8264e\" data-type=\"subhead\">A retribution presidency</h2> <p>An exaggeration? Not at all. Trump has a plan for a second term that could make his first spell in the Oval Office \u2013 when his former chief of staff, John Kelly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/24/trump-fascist-reaction-john-kelly\">says he behaved like a fascist</a> \u2013 look normal. Narcissistic Trump says it will be a retribution presidency. For him it\u2019s all about getting even. Yet, if it happens, it will also be about abuse of power on a scale never before seen in America.</p> <p>Just look at what he\u2019s promising: mass deportations of immigrants; the jailing of political opponents and anyone he dislikes; the use of the US military against civilians, loosely defined as \u201cenemies within\u201d; officially approved vigilantism; and the abandoning, again, of the Paris climate agreement.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/25/opinion/what-trump-says.html\">Trump\u2019s stated agenda</a> includes possible, devastating military action to destroy the cities of hostile countries such as Iran; the deserting of US allies such as Britain and Ukraine and the appeasing of Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia; a likely global trade war involving punitive import tariffs, principally aimed at China; and, overall, utter disregard for America\u2019s treaty obligations, global responsibilities, international law and the UN system.</p> <p>Even if Trump does not do half of what he threatens, victory for him would be a disaster for America and the world \u2013 and this time, there will be few if any \u201cadults in the room\u201d to restrain him. His first victim could be US democracy, targeted on 6 January 2021 by his Maga mobsters, and now once again in his sights. Basically, Trump wants to change federal, state and local rules to ensure future elections produce the \u201cright\u201d results.</p> <p>Trump appears only too happy to further subvert the supreme court and the justice department in pursuit of this objective. Abortion rights, a key issue for Harris, will be further eroded if Trump wins, cheered on by conservative Christian evangelicals and Republican-led state legislatures. And human rights in general will suffer, whether they be those of migrants and their families, black men and other minorities, or gay and trans people. Free speech and independent journalism will also be at risk. Trump cannot abide contradiction. He demands sycophancy or silence.</p> <p>The prospect of Trump #2 should make America\u2019s allies tremble. This is the man who kowtowed to Russian, North Korean and Saudi dictators, tore up the landmark Iran nuclear deal, threatened to quit Nato and rowed constantly with Europe\u2019s leaders. Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/23/netanyahu-bibi-trump-pact-wrecked-prospects-regional-peace\">encouraged Israel\u2019s hard-right prime minister</a>, Benjamin Netanyahu, to ignore the Palestinians, cut money-making deals with Gulf Arabs and call it peace.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s past stupidity and cupidity played a big role in stoking the Middle East crisis, which has escalated with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/idf-israel-iran-strikes-explosions-tehran\">Israel\u2019s latest bombing of Iran</a>. On China, America\u2019s most important global relationship, Trump promises only greater confrontation, especially after last week\u2019s revelations that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/us/politics/trump-vance-hack.html\">Chinese hackers targeted him</a> and his weird running mate, JD&nbsp;Vance. On Ukraine, his policy is betrayal and surrender.</p> <p>All this can and must be avoided, yet America\u2019s friends and allies, looking on powerlessly (despite the well-intentioned interventions of some Labour party activists), have no say in heading off disaster. Nor, in effect, do most Americans, because of the anachronistic, scandalously unreformed electoral college system. The Harris-Trump result in at least 40 of the 50 states is a foregone conclusion.</p> <h2 data-note-id=\"0643ff1a-b0c6-454d-81b3-22e5eede0103\" data-type=\"subhead\">Brutal, desperate personal attacks</h2> <p>This election may pivot on choices made by a few thousand people in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia and Arizona. It could be that, as happened to Clinton in 2016, Harris wins the national popular vote but loses the electoral college. Or this wacky system could produce the opposite result. It\u2019s estimated that about 15% of voters remain undecided. That\u2019s more than enough to settle the outcome. It\u2019s still all up for grabs.</p> <p>It\u2019s going to get frantic. It could be terrifying. Expect bread and butter economic issues \u2013 food prices, jobs and housing \u2013 along with abortion and migration to dominate the final days, not weighty questions of governance, ethics and foreign policy. And expect ever more brutal, desperate personal attacks as each candidate demonises the other.</p> <p>This behaviour comes naturally to Trump. Not so Harris, though that will not stop her doubling down on her justified belief that this unhinged convicted felon, ageing rou\u00e9, and most divisive, immoral and vindictive of politicians is indeed a fascist who cares only for himself and will sacrifice democracy, liberty and the constitution in an egotistic orgy of self-worship. Harris will doubtless remind voters, too, that Trump is again refusing to promise to accept the result if he loses. Endless, vexatious litigation and furious disputes are a certainty. Violence is a distinct possibility.</p> <p>It\u2019s ironic \u2013 but those Americans who truly believe in democracy really have no choice at all on 5 November. The US remains a great country. It has many strengths. It also has many problems. Trump is not the answer. He&nbsp;will only make it worse. Vote Harris!</p>",

Nor, in effect, do most Americans, because of the anachronistic, scandalously unreformed electoral college system. The Harris-Trump result in at least 40 of the 50 states is a foregone conclusion. Brutal, desperate personal attacks This election may pivot on choices made by a few thousand people in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia and Arizona. It could be that, as happened to Clinton in 2016, Harris wins the national popular vote but loses the electoral college. Or this wacky system could produce the opposite result. It\u2019s estimated that about 15% of voters remain undecided. That\u2019s more than enough to settle the outcome. It\u2019s still all up for grabs. It\u2019s going to get frantic. It could be terrifying. Expect bread and butter economic issues \u2013 food prices, jobs and housing \u2013 along with abortion and migration to dominate the final days, not weighty questions of governance, ethics and foreign policy. And expect ever more brutal, desperate personal attacks as each candidate demonises the other. This behaviour comes naturally to Trump. Not so Harris, though that will not stop her doubling down on her justified belief that this unhinged convicted felon, ageing rou\u00e9, and most divisive, immoral and vindictive of politicians is indeed a fascist who cares only for himself and will sacrifice democracy, liberty and the constitution in an egotistic orgy of self-worship. Harris will doubtless remind voters, too, that Trump is again refusing to promise to accept the result if he loses. Endless, vexatious litigation and furious disputes are a certainty. Violence is a distinct possibility. It\u2019s ironic \u2013 but those Americans who truly believe in democracy really have no choice at all on 5 November. The US remains a great country. It has many strengths. It also has many problems. Trump is not the answer. He will only make it worse. Vote Harris!",

When I was at secondary school, our sixth form was a couple of prefab huts in the playground and our school library was turned into a classroom because there were more students than space.</p> <p>\u201cI felt very strongly that the governments of Thatcher and Major didn\u2019t care very much about schools like mine, communities like mine and the kids I went to school with. I wanted to do something about it and I did so by joining the Labour party \u2026 Being able to rebuild schools is fulfilling what I came into politics to do \u2013 to ensure children from ordinary backgrounds get a good chance in life.\u201d</p> <p>Even her cabinet colleagues have struggled for face time with the country\u2019s first female chancellor over the last three months. So when asked whether she has been able to see as much as she would like of her young family since the general election, she laughs ruefully.</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m in Washington, so you can draw your own conclusions! It is half-term next week and I will be delivering the budget. Maybe I get more points for being a good chancellor than being a good mother right now.\u201d</p> <p>Reeves knows the short-term price she is paying, but also the enormity of what she is doing. She compares what she hopes will be the effects of the budget with other huge moments in her party\u2019s history, and turning points for the country: the arrival of the Attlee government of 1945 which created the NHS; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/sep/19/harold-wilson-white-heat-technology-speech\">Harold Wilson and the \u201cwhite heat of technology</a>\u201d in 1964; and the drive and ambition of New Labour to rebuild public services after 1997.</p> <p>Inevitably, given the mind-boggling sums involved \u2013 she will announce moves to raise around \u00a340bn from tax rises and spending cuts, as well as changes to fiscal rules that will give room for up to \u00a350bn of new long-term investment \u2013 much coverage ahead of the budget has centred on which taxes will go up, who will be hit hardest, possible adverse market reactions to more borrowing, and which promises in Labour\u2019s manifesto will be broken in letter or spirit.</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t dodge the fact that it will be tough for many, describing what will be unveiled as the product of a twin-track strategy that is desperately needed to break free of 14 years of Tory short-termism and mismanagement. \u201cBy making the difficult decisions around tax and spending to bring the current budget into balance, but then to have the space to make these capital investments to rebuild our schools and hospitals, and leverage in private investment, that is going to be the big change,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Those \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d will involve panning business with a massive hike in employer national insurance contributions that will bring in a hefty \u00a320bn. Reeves is also likely to extend years of Tory freezes on tax thresholds for up to another two years beyond 2028, dragging hundreds of thousands more people into paying tax, and even more into higher rates as their pay rises.</p> <p>Asked whether this meant breaking Labour\u2019s manifesto commitments, at least in spirit (it promised not to raise national insurance or income tax), she swerves, and attempts to turn the argument completely on its head. \u201cThe day after the budget, people are not going to see those main taxes that they pay \u2013 income tax, national insurance, VAT \u2013 going up \u2026 We promised at the election that we wouldn\u2019t put up those taxes for working people. One of the things that has eroded trust in politics and politicians has been a failure to stick to manifesto commitments.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be that sort of government; I don\u2019t want to be that sort of chancellor. We made a commitment that we were not going to put up those key taxes paid by working people, and that is what I am determined to do on Wednesday.\u201d</p> <p>That will not convince many. But Reeves and Starmer seem to think they have built themselves some leeway with the public, some sort of permission to bend their own rules, because they have argued so incessantly that the Tories left the public finances in an even worse position than they had believed was the case before the election. Reeves suggests she has had to do what she is doing because it will be in the public interest. Hard but fair. Bending a promise or two, not breaking them.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone knows with the state of the public finances and the public services I have inherited that a responsible chancellor has got to make tough decisions on spending, welfare and tax to put our public finances on a sustainable footing, but I will do it in a way that people see I have done everything in my power to protect the living standards of working people.\u201d</p> <p>While tax rises will be the story of budget day, the really big change could turn out to be creating space for more long-term investment. If it works, it stands the chance of being transformational. Reeves describes the potential as \u201creally exciting\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason we changed the second of our fiscal rules is because otherwise we are stuck on a path with investment in our economy declining \u2026 having inherited a plan from the previous government where public sector capital investment would be falling during the course of this parliament \u2026 that would mean schools and hospitals not being built.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is a new settlement on Wednesday to rebuild our country and seize the massive opportunities in technology and energy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt would mean not taking massive opportunities to grow our economy in digital and in the energy sector. We would miss out on that opportunity and jobs would go elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cI am not happy with that path of decline, and the solution to it is investment. So if the Tories oppose our new fiscal rules next week, they would be saying they are happy with that path of decline.\u201d</p> <p>Two weeks ago Reeves and the government announced \u00a321bn of investment in carbon capture and storage. \u201cThat is only possible because we are changing the way that we measure debt and take into account assets as well as liabilities. The second type of investment will be in the public realm. The number of schools that have been affected by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/aug/31/what-is-raac-reinforced-autoclaved-aerated-concrete-schools-buildings-england-close\">Raac concrete</a> \u2026 \u00a31.4bn for school rebuilding, which will mean 50 schools a year will be rebuilt \u2026 It would not have been possible to make these investments without changing the fiscal rules.\u201d</p> <p>She may be under the most intense pressure but Reeves seems to sense a possible place in history, having only been chancellor since early July. \u201cThis is only the fourth time that Labour has gone from opposition into government. In 1945, we rebuilt after the war; in 1964, we rebuilt with the white heat of technology; and in 1997, we rebuilt our public services. We need to do all of that now.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a new settlement on Wednesday to rebuild our country and seize the massive opportunities in technology and energy that are out there.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a global race on for those jobs and we need to seize them for Britain. If we can unlock that investment, public and private, then we can do great things as a country again.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Georgia\u2019s ruling party is leading in a pivotal parliamentary election widely seen as a make-or-break vote for the country\u2019s long-held aspiration for EU membership. Early official results, with 70% of precincts counted, showed the ruling Georgian Dream (GD) party had won 53% of the vote, the electoral commission said. But a united block of pro-western opposition parties have also declared victory, claiming they had clinched a collective majority, setting the stage for a confrontation over the future of the Caucasus country. Voters in the country of almost 4 million people on Saturday headed to the polls in a watershed election to decide whether the increasingly authoritarian GD party, which has been in power since 2012 and steered the country into a conservative course away from the west and closer to Russia, secures another four-year term. Bidzina Ivanishvili, the shadowy billionaire founder of GD, claimed victory shortly after polls closed, in what has been called the most consequential election since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. \u201cIt is a rare case in the world that the same party achieves such success in such a difficult situation \u2013 this is a good indicator of the talent of the Georgian people,\u201d Ivanishvili, widely considered to be the country\u2019s most powerful figure, said. If the central election projection holds, GD will secure a parliamentary majority, thwarting the opposition\u2019s hopes for a pro-western coalition of four blocs and effectively stalling the country\u2019s aspirations for EU integration. Rival exit polls offered starkly different projections: three indicated the opposition would secure a majority, while another predicted a comfortable win for the ruling GD party. Exit polls by the pro-opposition Formula and Mtavari Arkhi channels showed big gains for pro-western opposition parties, which they suggested would be able to form a majority together in the 150-seat parliament. An exit poll by the Georgian Dream-supporting Imedi TV channel said the ruling party would win a majority of 56%. \u201cThe exit polls are showing an impressive 10% margin of victory for the opposition. We believe the Georgian public has voted clearly for a future at the heart of Europe and no amount of posturing will change that,\u201d said Tinatin Bokuchava, leader of the biggest opposition party, United National Movement (UNM), urging the GD party to step down. For the past three decades, Georgia has maintained strong pro-western aspirations, with polls showing up to 80% of its people favour joining the EU. In recent years, however, the government, led by the populist GD party, has increasingly shifted away from the west in favour of Russia, showing reluctance to condemn Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. Many expected that GD would become the biggest party yet might fall short of a majority and struggle to form a government, with all other blocs refusing to collaborate with it. The ruling GD was facing an unprecedented union of four pro-western opposition forces which had vowed to form a coalition government to oust it from power and put Georgia back on track to join the EU. The biggest opposition force is the centre-right UNM, a party founded by Mikheil Saakashvili, the former president who is in prison on charges of abuse of power which his allies say are politically motivated. Opposition exit polls predicted the UNM party would come second, followed by the Coalition for Change, an alliance that brings together several parties led by former UNM leaders. The results will be closely monitored in Moscow and Brussels, with the EU saying the vote would shape Tbilisi\u2019s prospects of joining the bloc. GD has run its campaign on accusations that the pro-western opposition was trying to pull Georgia into a Ukraine-style conflict. In 2008, Georgia fought a war with Russia that lasted five days but left deep scars, and the invasion of Ukraine has left some in the country wary of the possible consequences of provoking Russia by moving closer to the west. The party has also been accused by critics of plans to move the country in an authoritarian direction after Ivanishvili vowed to ban all the leading opposition parties and remove opposition lawmakers if his party was re-elected. \u201cThe government is openly pledging to transform Georgia into a one-party state \u2013 a move unprecedented in modern Georgian history,\u201d said Tina Khidasheli, chair of the non-governmental organisation Civic Idea and a former defence minister. Outside polling stations in central Tbilisi some voters echoed this sentiment. \u201cThis is the most important day in our modern history.

Support for the pro-western opposition groups generally comes from urban and younger voters, who envision their political future with the EU. \u201cOur democracy and future in Europe is at stake.

The ruling Georgian government, aligned with the deeply conservative and influential Orthodox church, has sought to galvanise anti-liberal sentiments by campaigning on \u201cfamily values\u201d and criticising what it portrays as western excesses. In the summer, the parliament passed legislation imposing sweeping restrictions on LGBTQ+ rights, a move critics say mirrors laws enacted in neighbouring Russia, where authorities have implemented a series of repressive measures against sexual minorities. Georgia\u2019s notoriously divided opposition has attempted to unite by forming four pro-European blocs, which have all endorsed the Georgian charter, an initiative proposed by the country\u2019s pro-western president, Salome Zourabichvili, urging them to prevent GD from forming a coalition and remaining in power. Zourabichvili, whose role is largely ceremonial, wrote on X on Saturday: \u201cEuropean Georgian is winning by 52%.\u201d The EU granted Georgia candidate membership status last year but has put its application on hold in response to a controversial \u201cforeign agents\u201d bill which was passed in May, requiring media and NGOs receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as \u201cagents of foreign influence\u201d. The bill, which triggered weeks of mass protests in the spring, has been labelled a \u201cRussian law\u201d by critics, who liken it to legislation introduced by the Kremlin a decade earlier to silence political dissent in the media and elsewhere. Independent NGOs have warned that GD will attempt to undermine the parliamentary elections, relying on their \u201cadministrative resources\u201d \u2013 an umbrella term that includes pressing state employees to vote and offering cash handouts to mostly rural voters. On Saturday morning, several videos circulated online appearing to show ballot stuffing and voter intimidation at various polling stations across Georgia. \u201cBidzina Ivanishvili\u2019s thugs are desperate to cling on to power and will resort to anything to subvert the election process,\u201d Bokuchava, the UNM leader, said as voting was under way. The opposition has warned that the ruling party may attempt to manipulate the results, which could trigger mass protests, potentially followed by a harsh police crackdown. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t expect Georgians to tolerate electoral fraud. People won\u2019t stand by as their future is taken from them,\u201d Bokuchava said.",

      "body": "<p>Spare a thought for beleaguered Pennsylvanians. During the past few weeks, they have been pummeled with <a href=\"https://go.adimpact.com/24-presidential-report-pt-2\">$280m worth</a> of election ads blazing on their TV and computer screens, part of an eye-popping $2.1bn spent so far on the US presidential election.</p> \n<p>Pennsylvania is one of the seven battleground states that, when it comes to choosing presidents, can seem as revered as the seven wonders of the world. Forget Democratic California, ditch reliably Republican Texas \u2013 it is these seven states that, come 5 November, will decide the outcome of one of the most consequential elections in modern times.</p> \n<p>Their names are seared into the minds of politically aware Americans: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Under the US\u2019s arcane electoral system, the occupant of the Oval Office is elected not through the popular vote but by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/19/election-electoral-college-explained\">electoral college votes</a> harvested state by state.</p> \n<p>Among them, the seven states control 93 electoral college votes (Pennsylvania has the largest number, 19, which is why its residents are so bombarded). In the final days, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris and their running mates, JD Vance and Tim Walz, will be scrambling all over them in an effort to reach the magic number for victory: 270 electoral college votes.</p> \n<p>The states are called battlegrounds for a reason \u2013 their loyalty cannot be taken for granted by either side. This year, though, their unpredictability has reached dizzying heights. The Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/aug/23/presidential-polls-kamala-harris-donald-trump-election\">presidential poll tracker</a> shows five of them essentially tied within a three-point margin of error, with only Arizona (where Trump is up four points) and Wisconsin (where Harris is up five) pulling away. Nate Cohn, the New York Times\u2019 polling expert, has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/upshot/trump-harris-polls-election.html?searchResultPosition=2\">drily noted</a> that the presidential polls are \u201cstarting to run out of room to get any closer\u201d.</p> \n<p>Guardian reporters are on the ground in each of the seven battlegrounds to test these confounding waters.</p> \n<p>\u2013<em> Ed Pilkington</em></p> \n<p>***</p> \n<h2><strong>Arizona</strong></h2> \n<p><em><strong>\u2018Why isn\u2019t Trump doing a little better here?\u2019</strong></em></p> \n<p>On a stiflingly hot afternoon last month, Lynn and Roger Seeley relaxed into an air-conditioned co-working space in a suburb east of Phoenix. They had come to hear the Democratic candidate for US Senate, Ruben Gallego, make his pitch to a roomful of small-business owners. Lifelong Republicans, they might have felt out of place at a Democratic campaign event in the pre-Trump era. But not now.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Arizona Republican party is not the same Republican party,\u201d said Lynn Seeley, who plans to vote for Kamala Harris in November. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t represent me any more.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Seeleys are among a group of disaffected Arizonans known as \u201cMcCain Republicans\u201d \u2013 moderates and independents who prefer the \u201cmaverick\u201d brand of politics of the late Arizona senator John McCain to Trump\u2019s Maga movement.</p> \n<p>The Trumpification of the state GOP, as well as rapid population growth, a large number of young Latino voters and a suburban shift away from the Republican party have created an opening for Democrats in recent election cycles, turning once ruby-red Arizona into a desert battleground.</p> \n<p>Polling shows Donald Trump with a narrow edge over Harris in the presidential race. The <a href=\"https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings\">Senate race</a>, which is critical to the party\u2019s slim hope of maintaining control of the chamber, appears to trend in Gallego\u2019s favor. The state also features <a href=\"https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings\">two of the most competitive</a> House races in the country, both key to winning the speaker\u2019s gavel. Arizonans are also voting on an initiative to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution.</p> \n<p>Across the sprawling Phoenix region, one of the fastest-growing in America, Trump and Harris signs dot xeriscaped yards. But roughly a third of Arizonans are unaffiliated, and since Trump\u2019s election in 2016 they have broken for Democrats in key statewide races.</p> \n<p>In 2020, Trump lost the state by fewer than 11,000 votes, the narrowest of any margin. It was the first time a Democratic presidential candidate had won Arizona since Bill Clinton in 1996, and before then, it was Harry Truman in 1948.</p> \n<p>\u201cArizona is not a blue state,\u201d said Samara Klar, a professor of political science at the University of Arizona. \u201cArizona has had very high inflation rates, very high increases in the cost of living, and an increase in the cost of gas. It\u2019s a border state during a border crisis. A Republican candidate should be cleaning up in Arizona. So the question is: why isn\u2019t Trump doing a little better here?\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>Lauren Gambino</strong><em><strong> | </strong>Chandler, Arizona</em></p> \n<p>***</p> \n<h2><strong>Georgia</strong></h2> \n<p><em><strong>Early voting hits records \u2013 but offers few clues</strong></em></p> \n<p>Mary Holewinski lives in Carrollton, Georgia, which is home turf for the far-right representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. But Holewinski is a Kamala Harris supporter and has a sign in her yard. It draws nasty looks, she said: \u201cI\u2019ve lost neighbor friends.\u201d</p> \n<p>Those tensions are ratcheting up, because the presidential election is already well under way in Georgia. More than 2 million Georgians - a quarter of its electorate - have already gone to the polls, setting early voting records each day.</p> \n<p>Both Harris and Trump consider Georgia \u2013 no longer a stereotypical \u201cdeep south\u201d state but one propelled by the economic and cultural clout of Atlanta - a crucial pickup. In 2020, the state went for Joe Biden by 11,779 votes, and Trump has since been charged in an election interference case after calling Georgia\u2019s secretary of state and asking him to \u201cfind\u201d 11,780 votes. A Georgia victory would represent belated validation for the former president.</p> \n<p>The candidates might as well have leased apartments in Atlanta, for all the time they\u2019re spending here.

      "bodyText": "Spare a thought for beleaguered Pennsylvanians. During the past few weeks, they have been pummeled with $280m worth of election ads blazing on their TV and computer screens, part of an eye-popping $2.1bn spent so far on the US presidential election. Pennsylvania is one of the seven battleground states that, when it comes to choosing presidents, can seem as revered as the seven wonders of the world. Forget Democratic California, ditch reliably Republican Texas \u2013 it is these seven states that, come 5 November, will decide the outcome of one of the most consequential elections in modern times. Their names are seared into the minds of politically aware Americans: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Under the US\u2019s arcane electoral system, the occupant of the Oval Office is elected not through the popular vote but by electoral college votes harvested state by state. Among them, the seven states control 93 electoral college votes (Pennsylvania has the largest number, 19, which is why its residents are so bombarded). In the final days, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris and their running mates, JD Vance and Tim Walz, will be scrambling all over them in an effort to reach the magic number for victory: 270 electoral college votes. The states are called battlegrounds for a reason \u2013 their loyalty cannot be taken for granted by either side. This year, though, their unpredictability has reached dizzying heights. The Guardian\u2019s presidential poll tracker shows five of them essentially tied within a three-point margin of error, with only Arizona (where Trump is up four points) and Wisconsin (where Harris is up five) pulling away. Nate Cohn, the New York Times\u2019 polling expert, has drily noted that the presidential polls are \u201cstarting to run out of room to get any closer\u201d. Guardian reporters are on the ground in each of the seven battlegrounds to test these confounding waters. \u2013 Ed Pilkington *** Arizona \u2018Why isn\u2019t Trump doing a little better here?\u2019 On a stiflingly hot afternoon last month, Lynn and Roger Seeley relaxed into an air-conditioned co-working space in a suburb east of Phoenix. They had come to hear the Democratic candidate for US Senate, Ruben Gallego, make his pitch to a roomful of small-business owners. Lifelong Republicans, they might have felt out of place at a Democratic campaign event in the pre-Trump era. But not now. \u201cThe Arizona Republican party is not the same Republican party,\u201d said Lynn Seeley, who plans to vote for Kamala Harris in November. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t represent me any more.\u201d The Seeleys are among a group of disaffected Arizonans known as \u201cMcCain Republicans\u201d \u2013 moderates and independents who prefer the \u201cmaverick\u201d brand of politics of the late Arizona senator John McCain to Trump\u2019s Maga movement. The Trumpification of the state GOP, as well as rapid population growth, a large number of young Latino voters and a suburban shift away from the Republican party have created an opening for Democrats in recent election cycles, turning once ruby-red Arizona into a desert battleground. Polling shows Donald Trump with a narrow edge over Harris in the presidential race. The Senate race, which is critical to the party\u2019s slim hope of maintaining control of the chamber, appears to trend in Gallego\u2019s favor. The state also features two of the most competitive House races in the country, both key to winning the speaker\u2019s gavel. Arizonans are also voting on an initiative to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution. Across the sprawling Phoenix region, one of the fastest-growing in America, Trump and Harris signs dot xeriscaped yards. But roughly a third of Arizonans are unaffiliated, and since Trump\u2019s election in 2016 they have broken for Democrats in key statewide races. In 2020, Trump lost the state by fewer than 11,000 votes, the narrowest of any margin. It was the first time a Democratic presidential candidate had won Arizona since Bill Clinton in 1996, and before then, it was Harry Truman in 1948. \u201cArizona is not a blue state,\u201d said Samara Klar, a professor of political science at the University of Arizona. \u201cArizona has had very high inflation rates, very high increases in the cost of living, and an increase in the cost of gas. It\u2019s a border state during a border crisis. A Republican candidate should be cleaning up in Arizona. So the question is: why isn\u2019t Trump doing a little better here?\u201d Lauren Gambino | Chandler, Arizona *** Georgia Early voting hits records \u2013 but offers few clues Mary Holewinski lives in Carrollton, Georgia, which is home turf for the far-right representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. But Holewinski is a Kamala Harris supporter and has a sign in her yard. It draws nasty looks, she said: \u201cI\u2019ve lost neighbor friends.\u201d Those tensions are ratcheting up, because the presidential election is already well under way in Georgia. More than 2 million Georgians - a quarter of its electorate - have already gone to the polls, setting early voting records each day. Both Harris and Trump consider Georgia \u2013 no longer a stereotypical \u201cdeep south\u201d state but one propelled by the economic and cultural clout of Atlanta - a crucial pickup. In 2020, the state went for Joe Biden by 11,779 votes, and Trump has since been charged in an election interference case after calling Georgia\u2019s secretary of state and asking him to \u201cfind\u201d 11,780 votes. A Georgia victory would represent belated validation for the former president. The candidates might as well have leased apartments in Atlanta, for all the time they\u2019re spending here. The difference between a Democrat winning 80% and 90% of Black men\u2019s votes could be larger than the overall margin of victory. But Georgia is no longer a state defined by Black and white voters. Asian and Latino population growth has changed the political landscape in suburban Atlanta, which helped drive the Biden victory here in 2020. And the conflict between conventional conservative Republicans and the Maga insurgency may also be determinative: suburban moderates in the Atlanta region turned against Trump in 2020, and he has done little since to win them back. Still, while historically Democrats in Georgia have been more likely to vote early than Republicans, Trump has pointedly instructed his supporters to vote early in person in Georgia, and many appear to be doing just that. \u201cI could care less about whether you like him or not. It\u2019s not a popularity contest,\u201d said Justin Thompson, a retired air force engineer from Macon. \u201cIt\u2019s what you got done. And he did get things done before the pandemic hit. And the only reason why he didn\u2019t get re-elected was because the pandemic hit.\u201d George Chidi | Atlanta, Georgia *** Michigan Turnout is key in state where many are angry over Gaza The trade union official had much to say, but he wasn\u2019t going to say it in public. The leader of a union branch at a Michigan factory, he was embarrassed to admit that most of its members support Donald Trump \u2013 even though he\u2019s also disparaging about what he saw as the Democratic party elite\u2019s failure to put the interests of working people ahead of powerful corporations. \u201cI don\u2019t want to disagree with the members in public because they have their reasons to do what they think is good for protecting their jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to explain that they\u2019re wrong but they don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d Like many in Michigan, he found himself torn: despairing of Trump yet not greatly enthused by Harris. A Rust belt state that once prospered from making cars, steel and other industrial products, Michigan lost many jobs to Mexico after the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) by Bill Clinton, an enduring source of resentment against the Democrats for some voters that helped Trump to power. That goes some way to explain why opinion polls continue to have the two candidates neck-and-neck in Michigan, even though the Harris campaign is heavily outspending Trump here and appears to have a better ground game with more volunteers. Turnout will be key: Trump won here by just 10,704 votes in 2016, then lost narrowly to Biden four years later. High on the list of demographic targets are Black voters in Michigan\u2019s largest city, Detroit, whose low turnout in 2016 was a factor in Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat in the state. Harris is also targeting white suburban women, many of whom previously supported Trump but have cooled on him over abortion rights, his continued false claims of election fraud and his criminal convictions. For all of that, the election in Michigan may be decided by events far away. More than 100,000 Michigan Democrats, many of them from the state\u2019s Arab American community around Detroit, abstained from supporting Biden in the Democratic primaries earlier this year because of his support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. So far, Harris has not significantly wavered from Biden on the issue. With polls this close, it could be decisive if Harris loses a fraction of these voters. Chris McGreal | Saginaw, Michigan *** Nevada Is Harris or Trump better for the working class? Urbin Gonzalez could have been working inside, in the air conditioning, at his regular job as a porter on the Las Vegas Strip. Instead, in the final days before the US election, he had chosen to go door-knocking in the 104F (40C) heat. \u201cI don\u2019t care because I\u2019m fighting for my situation,\u201d said Gonzalez, dabbing the sweat from his neck. \u201cAll Trump wants to do is cut taxes for his buddies, for his rich friends, not for us. Not for workers \u2026 This is personal.\u201d While the US economy broadly bounced back from the pandemic, Nevada has lagged behind. Nearly a quarter of jobs here are in leisure or hospitality, and although the Las Vegas Strip, where Gonzalez works, is back to booming with tourists, unemployment in Nevada remains the highest of any US state, and housing costs have soared. Both Trump and Harris have promised to turn things around: both have promised to eliminate federal income taxes on workers\u2019 tips, and both have vowed to expand tax credits for parents \u2013 though their plans widely differ when it comes to the finer points. Although Nevada has leaned Democratic in every presidential election since 2008, winning candidates have scraped by with slim margins. About 40% of voters don\u2019t identify with either Democrats or Republicans, and although a growing number of Latino voters \u2013 who now make up 20% of the electorate \u2013 have traditionally backed Democrats, the party\u2019s popularity is slipping. The state, which has just six electoral votes, is notoriously difficult to accurately poll \u2013 in large part because the big cities, Reno and Las Vegas, are home to a transient population, many of whom work unpredictable shifts in the state\u2019s 24/7 entertainment and hospitality industries. But many voters remember the days early in the Trump administration when costs were lower. \u201cI think the economy was just better when Trump was president,\u201d said Magaly Rodas, 32, while shopping at her local Latin market.

She was locked inside her home without power for eight days when Hurricane Helene struck western North Carolina last month. So when she uses the experience as a frame through which to view the impending election, she is not being frivolous. \u201cIf Trump doesn\u2019t get in, it\u2019s going to be worse than the hurricane,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be world war three.

It affected a rural mountainous region that is Trump\u2019s natural base \u2013 some 23 out of the 25 stricken counties are majority-Maga. So any decline in turnout would most likely hurt him.

White, blue-collar voters in these rural areas have sharply shifted away from Democrats in recent elections. Some Democrats expected Harris to choose the popular governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, as her running mate, given his impressive ability to secure consistent victories in such a closely contested state. Harris instead chose Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor, a decision that could come back to haunt her depending on the results in Pennsylvania. In her attempt to sway undecided voters, Harris has walked back some of her most progressive proposals from her 2020 presidential campaign \u2013 such as a ban on fracking, a major industry in Pennsylvania, on which she has now reversed her stance. It could all come down to Pennsylvania. Tom Morrissey, a 67-year-old voter from Harleysville attending a Democratic campaign event last month, was optimistic . \u201cWe love the enthusiasm. It\u2019s so important at this time,\u201d Morrissey said. \u201cWe have to save democracy.\u201d Joan E Greve | Ambler, Pennsylvania *** Wisconsin \u2018Let the anxiety wash over you and then refocus\u2019 Wearing matching hats emblazoned with the words \u201cSauk County Democrats\u201d, Deb and Rod Merritt, a retired couple from southern Wisconsin, joined the crowd to hear Barack Obama stump for Kamala Harris. \u201cWe\u2019re so apprehensive that the polls say they\u2019re close,\u201d said Rod Merritt. Sauk county is one of a handful of Wisconsin counties that has flipped from Democrats to Republicans and back. It\u2019s exactly the kind of place \u2013 a swing county in a swing state \u2013 that the campaigns are fighting over. A midwestern state in the Great Lakes region known for dairy production, manufacturing and healthcare, Wisconsin is considered to be part of the \u201cblue wall\u201d \u2013 the states Democrats consistently won in the 1990s and early 2000s. Trade unions historically helped drive voter turnout for Democrats, but a series of anti-labor laws passed under the Republican-controlled state government in 2011 dealt them a blow. Rural areas have increasingly turned to Republican candidates, leaving cities like Milwaukee \u2013 Wisconsin\u2019s most racially diverse \u2013 and the liberal stronghold of Madison as Democratic bastions. With the economy the top issue, it all comes down to turnout, with Republicans focusing on rural voters and young men, who have increasingly looked to conservative politics. The Democrats, meanwhile, hope the closeness of the race \u2013 in which a half-million people have already voted \u2013 will mobilize volunteers. \u201cIn some ways, the most important thing is learning some breathing exercises so that you can let the anxiety wash through you \u2013 and then refocus on knocking on the next door,\u201d said Ben Wikler, the chair of the Democratic party of Wisconsin.

By 2023 she was a scrappy outsider no longer, having moved to Faber with a second novel (<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/28/penance-by-eliza-clark-review-art-or-porn\">Penance</a></em>, presented as a true-crime story of a murder among teenagers) <em>and</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/15/grantas-best-of-young-british-novelists-meet-the-class-of-23\">scored a place</a> on <em>Granta</em>\u2019s once-in-a-decade list of 20 best fiction writers under 40.

She lives in south-east London.</p> <p><strong>What appeals to you about the short story?<br></strong>It\u2019s a little self-contained thing. It\u2019s nice to give yourself space to experiment with different stuff \u2013 to have a bunch of ideas that you can explore and a bunch of worlds that you can play with. This has been the most fun I\u2019ve had with a project because so much of it was so old, it didn\u2019t even feel as if I\u2019d written it. I could dramatically change and improve it, which is really satisfying.</p> <p><strong>Where do you find your inspiration?<br></strong>The title story [about a boy in a matriarchal fishing village who catches and keeps a mermaid-like \u201cfinwife\u201d]<strong> </strong>was inspired by a chapter in <em>Killing for Company</em>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/aug/25/biography.features1\">Brian Masters</a> book about Dennis Nilsen, where he talks about the culture of the fishing villages in Aberdeenshire that Nilsen grew up in, and I\u2019d wanted to do something with the idea of having this mythical creature and keeping it. That comes in part from a couple of Japanese films, <em>Marebito</em> by Takashi Shimizu, and Hideshi Hino\u2019s <em>Guinea Pig: Mermaid in a Manhole</em>. The creature is often quite submissive, and I was interested in changing that.</p> <p><strong>Tell me about the decision to include content warnings. Neither of your previous books carried them, right?<br></strong>No, and I felt a bit \u2013 not bad about it, but when I get tagged in a review, people generally say: \u201cYou should really check content warnings on this one.\u201d I think there\u2019s a lot of value in them, but they can be quite spoiler-y which is why they\u2019re at the back.</p> <p><strong>Parasitic infestations, cannibalism and </strong><strong>\u201cpustules and rot</strong><strong>\u201d are all listed. Do you have any rules when you\u2019re writing the gory bits?<br></strong>I recently saw <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/sep/22/the-substance-review-demi-moore-is-fearless-in-visceral-female-body-horror-coralie-fargeat\">The Substance</a></em>. The last half-hour is really heavy on prosthetic effects, and I was like, wow, I wish every film ended like this. When I\u2019m writing about that stuff I guess I\u2019m thinking about films that I like, which is actually not a very good thing because it can lead to quite bad prose, but I try to have a light hand and keep descriptions short and effective.</p> <p><strong>How do you feel about the collection being marketed as horror?<br></strong>I can already tell that there are going to be loads of people who pick this up expecting it to just be horror from start to finish. I would definitely like to work more in horror \u2013 I\u2019m so influenced by it but feel I\u2019d struggle not to pollute it with something else.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The way other people talk about writing I think, why do you do it? I wouldn\u2019t write if it wasn\u2019t my favourite thing to do</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>What are some of the positive and negative aspects of being a writer today?<br></strong>It can be a lot easier to find a niche and an audience but I often struggle with the signing table. I\u2019m not very good with eye contact and being on best behaviour. I sometimes feel really jealous of writers who were working before the \u201cyou\u2019re shit and I hate you\u201d era of social media, too.</p> <p><strong>Is it worse for young women?<br></strong>Definitely. There\u2019s also the classic thing of a young man publishing his debut novel and there\u2019s this immediate attempt to shove it into a canon \u2013 it\u2019s just like Kerouac or Bukowski. Whereas when you\u2019re a young woman, you\u2019re compared to this other woman that had this book published six months ago. Career-wise, I\u2019m looking forward to being an older writer.</p> <p><strong>Are things getting any better?<br></strong>I feel like we genuinely are publishing more young female writers, I just don\u2019t think we\u2019re respecting them. When they announced the Granta list, a male journalist wrote this incredibly effusive paragraph \u2013 <em>paragraph</em> \u2013 about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/13/the-young-team-graeme-armstrong-review\">Graeme Armstrong</a>. I\u2019m not saying Graeme Armstrong doesn\u2019t deserve a whole paragraph, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/23/cursed-bread-by-sophie-mackintosh-sex-death-and-baking\">Sophie Mackintosh</a> got two sentences, and then below that, \u201cmore in this vein with Eliza Clark, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/10/strangers-at-the-port-by-lauren-aimee-curtis-review-an-island-controlled-by-men\">Lauren Aimee Curtis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/20/children-of-paradise-by-camilla-grudova-review-loner-life-at-a-crumbling-cinema\">Camilla Grudova</a>\u201d. I\u2019d never felt so profoundly disrespected in my career, particularly because that vein is so broad. It felt so flagrantly sexist and reductive.</p> <p><strong>Did you write as a child?<br></strong>In school I would always write pages and pages and pages, and then be sent home with my own exercise book to write stories in. I never really did \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to keep up a sustained writing practice when you\u2019re eight \u2013 but at 13 or 14, I started writing fan fiction, and with an audience became super-prolific.</p> <p><strong>Do you have a writing routine?<br></strong>I don\u2019t sleep very well and the idea of me doing work before midday is very unlikely but I\u2019m quite happy to sit and work until two o\u2019clock in the morning. Sometimes when I see the way other people talk about writing I think, why do you do it? It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re having fun. I wouldn\u2019t write if it wasn\u2019t my favourite thing to do.</p> <p><strong>What are you working on now?<br></strong>I\u2019ve been working on a third novel for nearly two years, kind of in a speculative space. There\u2019s definitely a version that\u2019s very commercial, that could do really well, and there\u2019s definitely quite an off-putting version. It\u2019s been interesting thinking, what do I want to do with this?</p> <p><strong>Who are your literary influences?<br></strong>My first favourite author and one of my most influential is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/oct/11/stephen-king-i-loved-lord-of-the-flies-the-way-kids-love-harry-potter\">Stephen King</a>. That was what I cut my teeth on.</p> <p><strong>What have you read lately that you\u2019d recommend?<br></strong><em><a href=\"https://www.apocalypse-party.com/negativespace.html\">Negative Space</a></em> by BR Yeager, an independently published horror novel. It was so, so good \u2013 like, here\u2019s what you can do with a novel. Also, <em>The Sluts</em> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/04/dennis-cooper-george-miles-cycle-closer-cult-author-interview\">Dennis Cooper</a>, which I couldn\u2019t believe I hadn\u2019t read before. It\u2019s one of those books that feels like it should have been super-foundational. If you\u2019re stuck with reading, I recommend <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/07/mario-vargas-llosa-five-essential-novels\">The Time of the Hero</a></em> by Mario Vargas Llosa. It\u2019s published everywhere else as <em>The City and the Dogs</em><em>,</em> which is a much better title.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s next on your reading pile?<br></strong>I\u2019ve been quite bad for bouncing around a bunch of authors and not focusing on one to get a better sense of their whole oeuvre, so I\u2019m going to read more Dennis Cooper. I could do with reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/jan/24/essential-novels-ursula-k-le-guin\">more Ursula K Le Guin</a> as well. I read <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em> last year and found it revolutionary.</p> <p><strong>How do you arrange your books?<br></strong>Our shelves are colour-coded, which I always feel deeply embarrassed about. When we moved into our flat my partner was like, \u201cShall we colour code our books?\u201d And I said no. It does actually look really nice but it\u2019s a nightmare to find anything.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>She\u2019s Always Hungry</em> is published by Faber (\u00a39.99) on 7 November.

How do you feel about the collection being marketed as horror? I can already tell that there are going to be loads of people who pick this up expecting it to just be horror from start to finish. I would definitely like to work more in horror \u2013 I\u2019m so influenced by it but feel I\u2019d struggle not to pollute it with something else. What are some of the positive and negative aspects of being a writer today? It can be a lot easier to find a niche and an audience but I often struggle with the signing table. I\u2019m not very good with eye contact and being on best behaviour. I sometimes feel really jealous of writers who were working before the \u201cyou\u2019re shit and I hate you\u201d era of social media, too. Is it worse for young women? Definitely. There\u2019s also the classic thing of a young man publishing his debut novel and there\u2019s this immediate attempt to shove it into a canon \u2013 it\u2019s just like Kerouac or Bukowski. Whereas when you\u2019re a young woman, you\u2019re compared to this other woman that had this book published six months ago. Career-wise, I\u2019m looking forward to being an older writer. Are things getting any better? I feel like we genuinely are publishing more young female writers, I just don\u2019t think we\u2019re respecting them. When they announced the Granta list, a male journalist wrote this incredibly effusive paragraph \u2013 paragraph \u2013 about Graeme Armstrong. I\u2019m not saying Graeme Armstrong doesn\u2019t deserve a whole paragraph, but Sophie Mackintosh got two sentences, and then below that, \u201cmore in this vein with Eliza Clark, Lauren Aimee Curtis and Camilla Grudova\u201d. I\u2019d never felt so profoundly disrespected in my career, particularly because that vein is so broad. It felt so flagrantly sexist and reductive. Did you write as a child? In school I would always write pages and pages and pages, and then be sent home with my own exercise book to write stories in. I never really did \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to keep up a sustained writing practice when you\u2019re eight \u2013 but at 13 or 14, I started writing fan fiction, and with an audience became super-prolific. Do you have a writing routine? I don\u2019t sleep very well and the idea of me doing work before midday is very unlikely but I\u2019m quite happy to sit and work until two o\u2019clock in the morning. Sometimes when I see the way other people talk about writing I think, why do you do it? It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re having fun. I wouldn\u2019t write if it wasn\u2019t my favourite thing to do. What are you working on now? I\u2019ve been working on a third novel for nearly two years, kind of in a speculative space. There\u2019s definitely a version that\u2019s very commercial, that could do really well, and there\u2019s definitely quite an off-putting version. It\u2019s been interesting thinking, what do I want to do with this? Who are your literary influences? My first favourite author and one of my most influential is Stephen King. That was what I cut my teeth on. What have you read lately that you\u2019d recommend? Negative Space by BR Yeager, an independently published horror novel. It was so, so good \u2013 like, here\u2019s what you can do with a novel. Also, The Sluts by Dennis Cooper, which I couldn\u2019t believe I hadn\u2019t read before. It\u2019s one of those books that feels like it should have been super-foundational. If you\u2019re stuck with reading, I recommend The Time of the Hero by Mario Vargas Llosa. It\u2019s published everywhere else as The City and the Dogs, which is a much better title. What\u2019s next on your reading pile? I\u2019ve been quite bad for bouncing around a bunch of authors and not focusing on one to get a better sense of their whole oeuvre, so I\u2019m going to read more Dennis Cooper. I could do with reading more Ursula K Le Guin as well. I read The Left Hand of Darkness last year and found it revolutionary. How do you arrange your books? Our shelves are colour-coded, which I always feel deeply embarrassed about. When we moved into our flat my partner was like, \u201cShall we colour code our books?\u201d And I said no. It does actually look really nice but it\u2019s a nightmare to find anything. \u2022 She\u2019s Always Hungry is published by Faber (\u00a39.99) on 7 November.

Sale\u2019s start could hardly have been worse. Du Toit, soon to link up with South Africa for their autumn campaign, immediately produced a sublime offload to Muir, who scorched over the try-line after 65 seconds. Guy Pepper\u2019s clever pick-and-go took Bath within a couple of metres, allowing Reid to bash over on 20 minutes. Du Toit\u2019s cute dummy and speedy finish left Tadgh McElroy, Sale\u2019s debutant hooker, grasping at thin air six minutes later. The Sale prop James Harper had coughed up three scrum penalties in the first 15 minutes and was hooked after half an hour, Asher Opoku-Fordjour\u2019s introduction stabilising the visitors\u2019 set-piece. But they trailed 21-6 at half time. Hill capitalised on more uncharacteristically slack defence to clinch the bonus point before Butt, Bath\u2019s inside centre, was shown a red card by Karl Dickson for upending Le Roux Roets. Bath\u2019s prop Beno Obano had led the hosts out on his 150th appearance, and was withdrawn on 55 minutes to a grateful ovation. Sale then stirred when Joe Carpenter\u2019s beautiful grubber was finished off by a diving Will Addison. Robert du Preez stroked over the conversion but an unlikely comeback evaporated when Thomas was dismissed for an upright tackle on Muir as the wing dived for the corner. Carr-Smith and Van Wyk completed Bath\u2019s overwhelming victory. \u201cSome man,\u201d Van Graan said of Obano. \u201cWe gave him his cap in the changing room and you just needed to listen to the applause to appreciate the calibre of the man. What he\u2019s done for the club in good and bad times. \u201cGetting a red card in [last season\u2019s Premiership] final, how he\u2019s dealt with that not only as a player and a human being, is an example to all.\u201d Bath are increasingly the real deal but Sale have hard work ahead. \u201cI know I\u2019m going to put it right,\u201d said Sanderson, adding that the Premiership\u2019s four-week break for the autumn internationals comes at a good time. \u201cWe are going to put it right as a group and we know what to put right, which is to be better defensively.\u201d",

It created what the Israelis call an encircling \u201cring of fire\u201d, building an \u201caxis of resistance\u201d involving Shia militias such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and groups in Iraq and Syria \u2013 as well as the Sunni Islamists of Hamas.</p> <p>Ever since 7 October 2023, Israel\u2019s hard-right government, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, has gradually, some would say intentionally, expanded the Gaza war in order to hit back at these groups \u2013 and Iran itself. Netanyahu has long viewed the encirclement, especially Hezbollah\u2019s incessant rocket attacks and Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, as existential threats.</p> <p>Something had to give. And on 1&nbsp;April this year, it did. Israel bombed Iran\u2019s diplomatic consulate in Damascus, killing two senior generals. It claimed they had been masterminding attacks. Iran, outraged, hit back on 13 April, mounting its first direct military assault on Israeli territory. The taboo was broken.</p> <p>Israel subsequently retaliated in kind, but neither side did much damage \u2013 probably deliberately. Yet the ensuing calm couldn\u2019t last. Two devastating and humiliating Israeli assassinations, of Hamas\u2019s political chief, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran in July and of Hezbollah\u2019s leader, Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut last month, shifted the dial once again.</p> <p>Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, an anti-western hardliner, was a personal friend of Nasrallah \u2013 and was reportedly deeply aggrieved by his death. Khamenei also declared that Haniyeh\u2019s killing, while he was a guest in Iran\u2019s capital city, was an insult that could not be borne. So on 1 October, Iran launched its second, larger direct attack.</p>    <p>This is the attack that Israel responded to on Saturday, after three weeks of keeping the region guessing over what it would do. There was disagreement at the highest levels. Hawks argued that Israel should use this opportunity to target Iran\u2019s nuclear and energy facilities, even to try to eliminate Khamenei and other top leaders.</p> <p>The fact that, in the event, Israel confined itself to hitting military bases, and was apparently careful to avoid civilian casualties, is being seen as a success for American diplomacy. US president Joe Biden privately pressured Netanyahu not to contribute further to the escalatory spiral. He sent his secretary of state, Antony Blinken, to Jerusalem last week to drive home the point.</p> <p>Biden seems to have prevailed, this time \u2013 a rare instance, since 7&nbsp;October, of Netanyahu accepting American advice. But Israel\u2019s leader evidently still reserves the right to hit nuclear facilities and other high-value targets should Tehran retaliate yet again. And Iran\u2019s damaged air defences may now be less able to fend off future attacks.</p> <p>Knowing this could all still spin out of control, the weekend message to Iran from the Pentagon was crystal clear: do not even think about hitting back. Cease and desist. Draw a line. That same message was repeated by Keir Starmer, UK prime minister,, speaking at the Commonwealth summit in&nbsp;Samoa.</p> <p>\u201cI am clear that Israel has the right to defend itself against Iranian aggression. I\u2019m equally clear that we need to avoid further regional escalation and urge all sides to show restraint. Iran should not respond,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cWe will continue to work with allies to de-escalate the situation.\u201d</p> <p>Two weeks away from a knife-edge presidential election in which Donald Trump is claiming Biden and his protege, Kamala Harris, are hopelessly failing to control the crisis, the US administration badly wants to calm things down. For that same reason, the Pentagon stressed US forces had not been involved in the latest Israeli strikes.</p> <p>Early indications suggest Iran has got the message, that it is inclined to play down this latest round of hostilities, and that it will not return fire immediately. But there is no shortage of hawks in Tehran, too. They will press for tougher action.</p> <p>As Blinken\u2019s latest futile attempts to restart talks on a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal showed last week, the root causes of all this corrosive enmity, violence and chronic instability remain fundamentally unaddressed. Even as Israel and Iran trade blows, so far with one hand tied behind their backs, the appalling human tragedy in Gaza continues unchecked \u2013 and, worse, is pushed out of the headlines.</p> <p>And yet, unless and until Gaza and the wider Palestinian question is resolved, it is only a matter of time before the next, even more dangerous round of direct Israel-Iran fighting explodes across the face of the Middle East.</p>",

Two devastating and humiliating Israeli assassinations, of Hamas\u2019s political chief, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran in July and of Hezbollah\u2019s leader, Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut last month, shifted the dial once again. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, an anti-western hardliner, was a personal friend of Nasrallah \u2013 and was reportedly deeply aggrieved by his death. Khamenei also declared that Haniyeh\u2019s killing, while he was a guest in Iran\u2019s capital city, was an insult that could not be borne. So on 1 October, Iran launched its second, larger direct attack. This is the attack that Israel responded to on Saturday, after three weeks of keeping the region guessing over what it would do. There was disagreement at the highest levels. Hawks argued that Israel should use this opportunity to target Iran\u2019s nuclear and energy facilities, even to try to eliminate Khamenei and other top leaders. The fact that, in the event, Israel confined itself to hitting military bases, and was apparently careful to avoid civilian casualties, is being seen as a success for American diplomacy. US president Joe Biden privately pressured Netanyahu not to contribute further to the escalatory spiral. He sent his secretary of state, Antony Blinken, to Jerusalem last week to drive home the point. Biden seems to have prevailed, this time \u2013 a rare instance, since 7 October, of Netanyahu accepting American advice. But Israel\u2019s leader evidently still reserves the right to hit nuclear facilities and other high-value targets should Tehran retaliate yet again. And Iran\u2019s damaged air defences may now be less able to fend off future attacks. Knowing this could all still spin out of control, the weekend message to Iran from the Pentagon was crystal clear: do not even think about hitting back. Cease and desist. Draw a line. That same message was repeated by Keir Starmer, UK prime minister,, speaking at the Commonwealth summit in Samoa. \u201cI am clear that Israel has the right to defend itself against Iranian aggression. I\u2019m equally clear that we need to avoid further regional escalation and urge all sides to show restraint. Iran should not respond,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cWe will continue to work with allies to de-escalate the situation.\u201d Two weeks away from a knife-edge presidential election in which Donald Trump is claiming Biden and his protege, Kamala Harris, are hopelessly failing to control the crisis, the US administration badly wants to calm things down. For that same reason, the Pentagon stressed US forces had not been involved in the latest Israeli strikes. Early indications suggest Iran has got the message, that it is inclined to play down this latest round of hostilities, and that it will not return fire immediately. But there is no shortage of hawks in Tehran, too. They will press for tougher action. As Blinken\u2019s latest futile attempts to restart talks on a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal showed last week, the root causes of all this corrosive enmity, violence and chronic instability remain fundamentally unaddressed. Even as Israel and Iran trade blows, so far with one hand tied behind their backs, the appalling human tragedy in Gaza continues unchecked \u2013 and, worse, is pushed out of the headlines. And yet, unless and until Gaza and the wider Palestinian question is resolved, it is only a matter of time before the next, even more dangerous round of direct Israel-Iran fighting explodes across the face of the Middle East.",

Neal\u2019s Yard Dairy, a distributor and retailer of British artisan cheese, delivered 22 tonnes of award-winning clothbound cheddar to the alleged fraudster posing as a wholesale distributor for a large French retailer before realising it had been duped. Oliver, 49, described the incident involving more than 950 wheels of cheddar as a \u201cbrazen heist of shocking proportions\u201d. He told followers on Instagram to be alert if they heard anything about \u201clorryloads of very posh cheese\u201d being offered \u201cfor cheap\u201d, adding that the cheddar would have originally been worth about \u00a3300,000.

The three cheeses sell for between \u00a37.15 and \u00a312.90 for a small piece weighing 250-300g. Neal\u2019s Yard Dairy added it was working with the Metropolitan police to identify the perpetrators.

Writing on-the-whistle match reports is stressful even when nothing happens in the last 20 minutes. So spare a thought for John Brewin who was at Brighton for us today. Writing on-the-whistle match reports is stressful even when nothing happens in the last 20 minutes. So spare a thought for Peter Lansley, who was at Villa Park for us today. \u201cRoy, your reaction?\u201d Writing on-the-whistle match reports is stressful even when nothing happens in the last 20 minutes. So spare a thought for Ben Bloom, who was at Brentford for us today. The updated Premier League table Don\u2019t forget to join Barry Glendenning for the late game That was all a bit frantic. But it\u2019s over now, It must have been good, but I lost it somehow and these are the final scores in our featured games. Premier League Aston Villa 1-1 Bournemouth Brentford 4-3 Ipswich Brighton 2-2 Wolves Manchester City 1-0 Southampton Championship Bristol City 0-0 Leeds Burnley 0-0 QPR Sunderland 2-0 Oxford Bundesliga Leipzig 3-1 Freiburg Ian Holloway\u2019s Swindon\u2122 scored an injury-time equaliser to draw 1-1 with Gillingham. That\u2019s a cracking result, especially as they had ten men for 81 minutes plus added time. Brentford have won a deranged classic at the Gtech. Championship full times: Burnley 0-0 QPR, Sunderland 2-0 Oxford Sunderland\u2019s lead is now a very healthy five points. Full times: Aston Villa 1-1 Bournemouth, Brighton 2-2 Wolves Brentford 4-3 Ipswich Liam Delap has hit the post! Dear me. Football, effing hell. Bryan Mbeumo\u2019s second goal has shattered Ipswich, who had equalised with 10 men. What a crazy game. \u201cI mean, I guess Joe Pearson has a point,\u201d writes Matt Dony. \u201cIt could be worse. He could be a drummer. Or a right back.\u201d An unrelated quiz question: guess where I played for the school team? Erling Haaland\u2019s early goal was enough for City, who go top of the league for at least 24 hours. Haaland also missed from two yards after half-time; even more astonishingly, City kept a clean sheet. There\u2019s late drama here, there and everywhere: the substitute Evanilson has equalised with a brilliant header! A stunning comeback from Wolves! Brighton muffed a four-on-one break and moments later Matheus Cunha equalised for Wolves! Brentford 3-3 Ipswich \u201cThankfully switched to watch Brentford at half time,\u201d says Martin Widdicks. \u201c Best described as a \u2018magnificent game\u2019 (with a Barry Davies voice).\u201d You have to see he was magnificent. I can him now in the mind\u2019s ear: \u2018Pulsating stuff!\u2019 GOAL! Wayne Rooney\u2019s Plymouth\u2122 3-3 Preston Another crazy afternoon at Home Park, where Plymouth have come from 3-0 down to equalise! Awp, it\u2019s not over yet at the Amex. \u201cNot Prem era, but I just about remember Wednesday blowing a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 to Villa on the opening day of the 1991-92 season,\u201d says Joe Ludlam. \u201cLike his son today, David Hirst scored and ended up on the losing side.\u201d Of course, the return of Judas! (And yes, Joe wrote his email before Ipswich\u2019s equaliser.) Another twist at the Gtech, where ten-man Ipswich have equalised through the substitute Liam Delap! The substitute Evan Ferguson smashes Brighton into a 2-0 lead \u2013 and up to fourth place in the Premier League table. Brentford 3-2 Ipswich \u201cI\u2019m really sorry for how it\u2019s working out for Ipswich at the moment,\u201d says Jeremy Boyce. \u201cStill outside the bottom three, but for how long? It\u2019s all been up and up up to now, but they\u2019re into the reality check. Like many before, they\u2019ve spent to fill out the thin promotion squad, the new players are still integrating, but the Premier League doesn\u2019t give you time to think, yet alone plan. \u201cWorse still, they\u2019ve brought Kalvin in, and he\u2019s not in a good place. I\u2019m a Leeds fan and was sorry to see him go. He\u2019s had a bad story since then, and done no favours to West Ham or Ipswich yet. He\u2019s Leeds till he dies, and the sooner he gets back there the better, for him and for everyone else, and lift the Albatross he\u2019s been carrying the last few years. Alone, alone, all all alone, alone on the deep blue sea\u2026\u201d I\u2019ve not seen Ipswich\u2019s games so can\u2019t just Kalvin Phillips\u2019 overall performances but he did play an excellent pass in the build up to their first goal today. The first 3-2 win from 2-0 down of the Premier League era \u201cI\u2019d hazard a guess it was Man United beating City at Maine Road with Keane scoring the winner,\u201d says Jeff Black. That game, in November 1993, was my first thought as well. But it was preceded by Dave Beasant\u2019s worst nightmare. Villa have finally broken Bournemouth down. The goal was scored by a substitute \u2013 not Jhon Duran but Ross Barkley, who hooked a close-range shot past Mark Travers from Leon Bailey\u2019s header. It\u2019s his first in the Premier League for Villa, who will go third if they win this. They\u2019re also top of the Champions League. Unai Emery, bloody hell. \u201cWould Matt Dony be ashamed if his son turned out to be the next Chris Squire, Tony Levin, or Bootsy Collins?\u201d sniffs Joe Pearson. \u201cI think not. Come on Matt, get him one of those Fender five-string fretless basses!\u201d \u201cCity v Southampton is is sooo boring,\u201d writes Louise. \u201cIs this what we get when they have too many matches to play? City playing at 70%? Imagine, what do you pay as City fan for a season ticket\u2026\u201d Aston Villa 0-0 Bournemouth The substitute Jhon Duran has shot wide when - by all accounts, because I can\u2019t legally watch the game so I\u2019m reliant on others \u2013 he should have scored. Poor Harry Clarke, making his first Premier League start, has had a Woodgate Plus. He scored an own goal (though it should have been given to Yoane Wissa), gave away a penalty and has now been sent off for a second yellow card. Okay, quiz question: who were the first team to come from 2-0 down to win 3-2 in the Premier League era? Taking the positive Ipswich haven\u2019t won a game but they\u2019re still outside the relegation places as things stand. Brentford 3-2 Ipswich It sounds like Brentford are well on top now. This will shatter Ipswich if they lose, especially as they had chances to go 3-0 up just before the nightmare began. Everton v Fulham is the late Premier League game. Barry Glendenning is your man for the team news and so much more. Brentford 3-2 Ipswich \u201cMy recollection of Livy (some 60 years ago) is that Gaius Mucus Scaevola put his right hand in a fire to convince Lars Porsena, the king of the besieging Etruscans, that Rome would never surrender,\u201d begins Simon Legg. \u201cScaevola\u2019s crazed determination gave \u2018sinister\u2019 an otherworldly air. \u201cAs an aside Edith Wharton has form on this. Newland Archer\u2019s boss tells him that he \u2018wouldn\u2019t put his hand in the fire for that one\u2019, referring to the oh-so-beautiful Ellen - a clear reference to Scaevola. We know (or think we know) that Wharton had seen the Tiepolo picture of Scaevola at the Ca\u2019 Dolfin in Venice because she wrote in 1922 that, while she was loth to differ in any way from the judgement of Henry James, she very much admired this particular Tiepolo. Except . .the painting had already been sold and shipped to Russia by the time the wonderful Edith rocked up in La Serenissima. Given that \u2018The Age of Innocence\u2019 is a delicious melange of faked up history designed to mislead the reader it\u2019s no small joy to find out that the (dread word) \u2018backstory\u2019 has its own complications. \u201cNone of which matters but you\u2019ll see from my email address that I\u2019m in Suffolk and, right now, the pain that is football is too great to bear.\u201d Aberdeen v Dundee United (5.30pm) \u201cDear Mr Smyth, please disregard the previous email sent from this address,\u201d writes Simon McMahon. \u201cYour parcel has incorrect delivery information. Please reply to this email with your bank details immediately to enable us to arrange a transfer to account number 1909, sort code 1982/83. Kind regards, come on United!\u201d \u201cIt feels like there have been a ridiculous number of 2-0 deficits turned into 3-2 leads in the Premier League this season,\u201d says Adam Becker. \u201cIs it always this way and I haven\u2019t been paying attention?\u201d Since football became a disgrace to democracy, it\u2019s been fairly common to see the richest teams come from 2-0 down to win. This season it feels like it\u2019s happening more in games that involve the have-nots. It\u2019s turning into a really good day for Sunderland. Leeds drew, Burnley are drawing and Wilson Isidor has just doubled their lead with a brilliant goal. The latest scores in our featured games Premier League Aston Villa 0-0 Bournemouth Brentford 3-2 Ipswich Brighton 1-0 Wolves Manchester City 1-0 Southampton Championship Bristol City 0-0 Leeds (FT) Burnley 0-0 QPR Sunderland 1-0 Oxford Bundesliga Leipzig 3-1 Freiburg (2.30pm) \u201cShaun Tooze\u2019s message brought to mind one of my favourite quiz questions,\u201d says Adam Griffiths. \u201c\u2018Sunderland did it in 1979, Villa did it in 1981. Who did it in 1980?\u2019 \u201cThe answer being Trevor Brooking (scorer of winning goals in FA Cup finals).\u201d Bryan Mbeumo has completed a remarkable comeback, scoring nonchalantly from the spot after a penalty was awarded by VAR for a foul by poor Harry Clarke on Keane Lewis-Potter. Brentford have scored three goals since the 43rd minute. Man City 1-0 Southampton And now Erling Haaland has missed an absolute sitter from Savinho\u2019s cross. He was barely two yards out and passed it wide. Ramsdale was flying towards him so you can understand why he tried to be so precise. But it\u2019s never a great look to miss from two yards, especially when you\u2019re the world\u2019s deadliest footballer. GOAL! Leipzig 3-1 Freiburg (Openda 75) Leipzig are heading top of the Bundesliga, at least for 24 hours. Bayern Munich play at Bochum tomorrow. Championship Wayne Rooney\u2019s Plymouth\u2122 are having a bit of a nightmare at home to Preston. Brad Potts has made it 3-0 right at the start of the second half. \u201cCoventry scored for Wrexham against Charlton,\u201d notes Shaun Tooze. \u201cJust a thought, but that has to be made into a weird, trick quiz question somehow? There have to have been other examples like this too, right??\u201d Wouldn\u2019t be so sure. I mean, have you ever heard of a footballer called with the surname Charlton? \u201cAjax 1971 had 11 left-footers,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201c11 right-footers too.\u201d And industrial quantities of Kool-Aid! \u201cA clarification, Rob - Ian Holloway isn\u2019t taking charge of Swindon today,\u201d writes Rob Francis. \u201cI\u2019m at the County Ground right now and I wonder if he\u2019s starting to worry about what he\u2019s got himself into\u2026 we\u2019re sliding towards non-league.\u201d Yes, apologies, I realised my mistake, was about to correct it and then somebody scored and that was the end of that. \u201cYoung Master Dony is right-handed, but left-footed,\u201d writes Matt Dony. \u201cI always told him that decent left-footers are like sought after, and he\u2019ll always have a place in a team. Maybe I should get him a bass, too. Decent bassists are similarly rare. Of course, the problem is, then he would actually be a bassist. And the guitarist in me couldn\u2019t live with the shame. What a quandary. Anyway, he once came home from training and excitedly told me that his coach had asked him to play on the right wing, and come inside; \u2018So, dad, I\u2019m basically like Messi.\u2019 Ah, the confidence of youth.\u201d It\u2019s high time the cocky little git was informed that Messi stopped playing regularly on the right in 2008-09. That\u2019s really sweet, he sounds like a lovely kid. So much so that I think the Clockwatch community should club together to buy him a bass guitar. And a load of lessons with Nicky Wire. The half-time scores in our featured games Premier League Aston Villa 0-0 Bournemouth Brentford 2-2 Ipswich Brighton 1-0 Wolves Manchester City 1-0 Southampton Championship Burnley 0-0 QPR Sunderland 1-0 Oxford GOAL! Leipzig 2-1 Freiburg (Geertruida 58) All change at the Red Bull arena. Willi Orban equalised and now another defender, Lutsharel Geertruida, has put them ahead. Half time: Manchester City 1-0 Southampton The Southampton manager Russell Martin was booked just before half time and he\u2019s chuntering away furiously at somebody. Eventually Jan Bednarek guides him down the tunnel. Brentford 2-2 Ipswich There was a long check for offside but the goal stands. And it has gone down as an own goal from the defender Harry Clarke, even though Wissa\u2019s shot was on target. When did that change? GOAL! Leipzig 1-1 Freiburg (Orban 47) Manchester City 1-0 Southampton Cameron Archer has hit the bar for Southampton, though he was offside so it wouldn\u2019t have counted. Yoane Wissa strikes again! Brentford played through the press superbly, with Wissa put through on goal by an excellent pass. His shot was half blocked by Muric and then slid into his own net by Harry Clarke. It was going in anyway. Danny Welbeck\u2019s dream season continues! He made a well-timed run to meet a sohrt through pass from Georginio Rutter and banged a first-time shot across Jose Sa. Good finish. \u201cThe funny thing about the Old Trafford brawl in 1990, apart from it involving, the ever so mild-mannered Denis Irwin, was that there was an actual points deduction for poor behaviour on the field of play,\u201d writes Niall Mullen. \u201cYet somehow the earth continued to spin on its axis and nary a team of high-powered lawyerbots was engaged. Different times I guess.\u201d Aye. In those days the only available response was a siege mentality. He\u2019s back. Ipswich missed a couple of chances to go 3-0 up; now the game is back in the balance. Vitaly Janelt maded a good run and crossed low towards Wissa, who hit a decisive first-time finish past Muric. Proper player, him. \u201cI seem to recall the decidedly fun fact that Mark Travers once scored a league goal for Weymouth on his debut,\u201d writes Dan Osborn. \u201cWhich begs the question: how many other goalkeepers have scored goals on debut?\u201d That sounds like one for The Knowledge. If I remember I\u2019ll put it in \u2018Can you help?\u2019 this week. Aston Villa 0-0 Bournemouth Another excellent save from Mark Travers, this time to deny Ezri Konsa. It sounds like he\u2019s having a blinder. Man City 1-0 Southampton Aaron Ramsdale almost gives a goal away with a dodgy pass to Bernardo Silva. Taylor Harwood-Bellis gets him out of trouble with a sliding block. I\u2019ve said it before, I\u2019ll say it again: John Beck\u2019s Cambridge never had this problem. Brentford 0-2 Ipswich Chiedozie Ogbene has been stretched off, with Wes Burns replacing him. It sounds like he may have jarred something in the build up to the second goal. Manchester City 1-0 Southampton \u201cLook, Rob,\u201d says Ian Copestake, \u201cwe don\u2019t have to be etymological experts to know that too many left footed players is literally, as the Latins would say, sinister. This reason alone should see City lose at least three titles!\u201d Can we please find a game in which Liverpool 2013-14 played six left-footers? That way Jose can claim another title. The latest scores in our featured games Premier League Aston Villa 0-0 Bournemouth Brentford 0-2 Ipswich Brighton 0-0 Wolves Manchester City 1-0 Southampton Championship Bristol City 0-0 Leeds (FT) Burnley 0-0 QPR Sunderland 1-0 Oxford Bundesliga Leipzig 0-1 Freiburg (2.30pm) George Hirst made the first; now he\u2019s scored the second! Conor Chaplin put him through on goal with a killer angled pass and Hirst calmly clipped the ball over the outrushing Flekken. Two lovely goals from Ipswich, although Thomas Frank won\u2019t be happy with how space they had. The Bournemouth players have all been to Specsavers; the ball was fractionally out of play so the goal will not count. An expert finish from Sammie Szmodics has given Ipswich a surprise lead at Brentford. Kalvin Phillips fired a really good pass into George Hirst, who turned smartly and played in Szmodics. He opened his body and shaped a first-time curler past Flekken from the edge of the area. John McGinn has put Villa in front. Bournemouth stopped playing, thinking the ball had gone out of play. Ollie Watkins continued and teed up McGinn to score on his Premier League return. It\u2019s being checked by Stockley Park\u2019s finest. La Liga Villarreal have moved up to third after a 2-1 win at Valladolid. Leicester alumnus Ayoze Perez scored a late winner to continue their fine start to the season (a tonking at home to Barcelona notwithstanding). Aston Villa 0-0 Bournemouth The Bournemouth keeper Mark Travers, in for the injured/unwell/lookIdon\u2019tknowokay Kepa, has apparenetly made two or three fine saves already. \u201cOh, Choccy,\u201d says Martin Widdicks, \u201cnot sure I remember many good goals that he scored, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll correct me! Also, one of the instigators of that Arsenal - United brawl, I think\u2026 \u201cDecided to watch Brighton - Wolves. Really don\u2019t understand how Wolves are struggling so much. They were decent against Forest and look dangerous against Brighton. Is it just their tough fixture list?\u201d Brian McClair did score some cracking volleys. The most famous was against Liverpool on New Year\u2019s Day in 1989 but his best was surely this one early in his United career. (As for the brawl, he poured petrol on it by hoofing Nigel Winterburn in the back, but it was sparked by Anders Limpar going over the top. Well, that and nearly eight years of mutual enmity.) \u201c\ufeffRobster!\u201d writes somebody who appears to have hacked Simon McMahon\u2019s email. \u201cLatest scores from Scotland? Your guess is as good as mine. I\u2019ve not been able to concentrate since I dropped eldest daughter and dedicated Tangerine Army foot soldier Evie at the train station this morning for tonight\u2019s big game at Pittodrie between Aberdeen and Dundee United. \u201cSecond v fourth, should be a cracker. Aberdeen are flying high after 13 straight wins followed by a draw from 2-0 down at Celtic last week, but they\u2019ve not played us yet. We were 2-1 down at home to Hibs in the 93rd minute, and still won. What a team! All together now, IT\u2019S UNITED, THEY\u2019RE MY OWN TEAM, IT\u2019S UNITED, BLACK AND TANGERINE, IT\u2019S UNITED, IT\u2019S GOT TO BE, D.U.F.C.!!! Come on United!!!\u201d Hacking a person\u2019s email is a crime you know. Ian Holloway\u2019s first game as Swindon manager isn\u2019t quite going to plan: they\u2019re already a man and a goal down at home to Gillingham. GOAL! Sunderland 1-0 Oxford (Bellingham 16) Bellingham the Younger has headed the Championship leaders in front. \u201cLeeds Utd 2021-22 (the Bielsa team),\u201d offers Jeremy Boyce. \u201cMeslier, Cooper, Klich, Raphinha, Harrison, Firpo, Bamford...\u201d The latest scores in our featured games Premier League Aston Villa 0-0 Bournemouth Brentford 0-0 Ipswich Brighton 0-0 Wolves Manchester City 1-0 Southampton Championship Bristol City 0-0 Leeds (FT) Burnley 0-0 QPR Sunderland 0-0 Oxford Bundesliga Leipzig 0-1 Freiburg (2.30pm) \u201cPoor show,\u201d says Brendan Large. \u201cBernardo Silva...so it\u2019s six by my count.\u201d Gah, my mistake. So now I need to find a team with seven? Urgh. \u201cHopefully Brendan is not suggesting that Manchester City have broken any rules in having a severality of left-footers available for selection?\u201d says Jeremy Boyce. \u201cBut isn\u2019t it obvious? The game is played on a central axis, spread on either side. Wouldn\u2019t any team want an equal number of left and right footers to ensure balance and harmony? When I was a nipper I spotted that 90% of people were right footed, so managed to wangle myself a place in the team at left back by teaching myself to kick left-footed as well as right.\u201d I don\u2019t think Brendan was being critical of Our Pep, he\u2019s just a sucker for a bit of trivia. The beast is in the mood. Matheus Nunes gets round the back on the left and crosses towards the far post, where Erling Haaland quietly ragdolls Taylor Harwood-Bellis and slams the ball into the roof of the net. A quick follow-up to Brendan\u2019s question When Aston Villa lost 1-0 at home to Manchester City in April 1996, their starting XI included at least six left-footers: Mark Bosnich, Alan Wright, Steve Staunton, Andy Townsend, Tommy Johnson and Savo Milosevic. I always knew I was special. Brighton v Wolves team change Brighotn captain Lewis Dunk has done himself a mischief in the warm-up, so Igor Julio comes into the side. \u201cThat City line-up has a lot of left footers in it,\u201d says Brendan Large. \u201cIs that the most to start a PL game for one side?\u201d Look, I know I\u2019m special, but I\u2019m not so special I can instantly run through tens of thousands of Premier League line-ups in my head to see whether any team has started with more left-footers. Give me till 3.10pm at least. How many left-footers do you make it? Ederson, Gvardiol, Foden, Savinho, Haaland? On this day in 1999\u2026 Dennis Wise does San Siro. There\u2019s been all sorts of hype about Chido Obi-Martin, the Danish 16-year-old who recently joined Manchester United from Arsenal and made his debut today. Fair to say it went pretty well: he scored his first goal after 13 seconds. On this day in 1996\u2026 Southampton smash Manchester United 6-3, Matthew Le Tissier and Eyal Berkoviv score glorious goals and Roy Keane becomes the first player in football history to be sent off for sporting a menacing beard. GOAL! Leipzig 0-1 Freiburg (Doan 16) First blood to Freiburg in the big Bundesliga game. Ritsu Doan gets in round the back to head Vincenzo Grifo\u2019s excellent pass/cross into the net. \u201cStress-free football weekend for us Forest fans as we keep rewatching the highlights of last night\u2019s game,\u201d chirps Martin Widdicks. \u201cTrying to decide which of the four games to watch in my relaxed state - all bar the City game could be interesting although nothing will match that McClair goal\u2026. John Helm is so annoyed!\u201d Have you seen McClair\u2019s first goal a couple of minutes earlier? It\u2019s almost as good/bad. On this day in 1994\u2026 Ilie Dumitrescu is sent off as Notts County thrash Spurs in the League Cup. Championship Bristol City 0-0 Leeds Coventry 3-2 Luton Watford 1-0 Blackburn League One Mansfield 1-1 Birmingham Reading 1-0 Bristol Rovers League Two Colchester 1-2 Salford Morecambe 2-5 Chesterfield On this day in 1997\u2026 Emmanuel Petit puts hands on the referee Paul Durkin and is sent off. Coventry have come from 2-0 down to lead Luton 3-2, with Haji Wright putting them ahead in the 92nd minute. I say! 84 min: Bristol City 0-0 Leeds Still goalless at Ashton Gate, though it sounds like Leeds have been all over Bristol City in the second half. Brian McClair scores the greatest goal in football history. Unai Emery makes two changes from last weekend\u2019s win over Fulham: Ezri Konsa and John McGinn return for Villa in place of Diego Carlos and Leon Bailey. Ryan Christie and Justin Kluivert, who came off the bench to score in Bournemouth\u2019s win over Arsenal, come into the starting XI along with Mark Travers and Enes Unal. Alex Scott, Marcus Tavernier, Kepa and Evanilson drop out. Brentford are boosted by the return from injury of the excellent Yoane Wissa. He replaces Kevin Schade and Mads Roerslev is in for the injured Kristoffer Ajer. Kieran McKenna has made six changes to his Ipswich side, although most are due to injury and illness. Harry Clarke, Jens Cajuste, Sam Szmodics, Chiedozie Ogbene, Conor Chaplin and George Hirst replace Luke Woolfenden, Omari Hutchinson, Sam Morsy, Wes Burns, Jack Clarke and Liam Delap. Three changes for Brighton. Pervis Estupinan, Kaoru Mitoma and Jan Paul van Hecke come in for Igor Julio, Evan Ferguson and Jake Hinshelwood. That means Danny Welbeck is fit to start. Just the one change for Wolves: Tommy Doyle replaces Andre in midfield. Our Pep makes three changes from last weekend\u2019s win at Molineux. Manuel Akanji replaces goal machine John Stones, Phil Foden is in for Jeremy Doku and Matheus Nunes replaces Ilkay Gundogan. City have only named five outfield subs. It looks like Southampton have switched to a back five. Jack Stephens, Adam Lallana come in for Yukinari Sugawara and Joe Aribo. On the same night\u2026 Dragan Stojkovic strolls through the legendary AC Milan defence. On this day in 1988\u2026 a sizzling finish from Mike Phelan helps Norwich secure the second of five successive wins over Manchester United. EFL latest It\u2019s half-time in the 12.30pm games. In-form Leeds are being held by Bristol City, whose manager Liam Manning is back in the dugout after the awful death of his young son Theo, while Luton are 2-0 up at Coventry. Willum Willumsson has put the League One leaders Birmingham in front at Mansfield. You can get the latest from all the games on our live scores page.

      "body": "<p>Redemption for Gary O\u2019Neil. His Wolves side have rarely been faulted for lack of effort but while their manager\u2019s piercing gaze may regularly blaze with a sense of injustice at officialdom, individual mistakes, star players sold in the summer and lapses of concentration have piled up. They looked likely to be costly here, too, but at last, that hard work, the flashes of quality paid off. Wolves fought to the end when all seemed lost, mounting a thrilling two-goal comeback capped by Matheus Cunha\u2019s last-gasp equaliser.</p> \n<p>Danny Welbeck\u2019s 45th-minute opener had undone Wolves\u2019 solid first-half efforts. In the second half, the quality of the visitors\u2019 finishing had let them down before Evan Ferguson\u2019s first goal since November 2023 had put Brighton two up. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/oct/26/manchester-city-v-southampton-brighton-v-wolves-and-more-clockwatch-live\">Manchester City 1-0 Southampton, Brentford 4-3 Ipswich and more: clockwatch \u2013 live</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cTwo costly giveaways,\u201d O\u2019Neil said. Could he survive until next Saturday\u2019s meeting with fellow strugglers Crystal Palace? The odds were surely against that.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe decided to do it the hard way,\u201d said O\u2019Neil, in perpetual motion on the sideline but afterwards looking relaxed for the first time in many months. His team had edged away from the bottom of the Premier League. \u201cIt went crazy in the end \u2026 at 2-0 down, I thought I had some tough questions coming.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fabian H\u00fcrzeler, Brighton\u2019s wunderkind manager, is learning valuable lessons and will do so from a game that slipped from his grasp. Cunha\u2019s goal immediately followed four Brighton attackers charging forward with abandon towards the Wolves goal. \u201cWe failed today in our development,\u201d said H\u00fcrzeler. \u201cWe were not mature enough to win this game.\u201d</p> \n<p>At Brighton, H\u00fcrzeler will be given time to learn from mistakes.

      "bodyText": "Redemption for Gary O\u2019Neil. His Wolves side have rarely been faulted for lack of effort but while their manager\u2019s piercing gaze may regularly blaze with a sense of injustice at officialdom, individual mistakes, star players sold in the summer and lapses of concentration have piled up. They looked likely to be costly here, too, but at last, that hard work, the flashes of quality paid off. Wolves fought to the end when all seemed lost, mounting a thrilling two-goal comeback capped by Matheus Cunha\u2019s last-gasp equaliser. Danny Welbeck\u2019s 45th-minute opener had undone Wolves\u2019 solid first-half efforts. In the second half, the quality of the visitors\u2019 finishing had let them down before Evan Ferguson\u2019s first goal since November 2023 had put Brighton two up. \u201cTwo costly giveaways,\u201d O\u2019Neil said. Could he survive until next Saturday\u2019s meeting with fellow strugglers Crystal Palace? The odds were surely against that. \u201cWe decided to do it the hard way,\u201d said O\u2019Neil, in perpetual motion on the sideline but afterwards looking relaxed for the first time in many months. His team had edged away from the bottom of the Premier League. \u201cIt went crazy in the end \u2026 at 2-0 down, I thought I had some tough questions coming.\u201d Fabian H\u00fcrzeler, Brighton\u2019s wunderkind manager, is learning valuable lessons and will do so from a game that slipped from his grasp. Cunha\u2019s goal immediately followed four Brighton attackers charging forward with abandon towards the Wolves goal. \u201cWe failed today in our development,\u201d said H\u00fcrzeler. \u201cWe were not mature enough to win this game.\u201d At Brighton, H\u00fcrzeler will be given time to learn from mistakes. For O\u2019Neil, whose team last won in the league against Luton in April, the time for experimentation has long expired, even if Tommy Doyle\u2019s midfield passing range being employed from the start was a change of tack. If O\u2019Neil saw \u201cfight, passion and effort\u201d as key to his team\u2019s revival, he admitted disappointment in himself for the negative team selection of five in defence. It was Doyle who intercepted Mats Wieffer\u2019s pass to set up Cunha\u2019s equaliser, making up for blowing Wolves\u2019 best first-half chance, laid on by Cunha. In Doyle, Rayan A\u00eft-Nouri, scorer of their first goal, Jo\u00e3o Gomes and Cunha, Wolves do not lack for individual flair. A lack of solidity and concentration continue to be their weaknesses. In a hard-fought, intriguing tactical battle of a first half, O\u2019Neil, understandably given his employment prospects, was the antsier of the managers. Shaun Derry, the assistant assuming the role of the recently discarded set-piece coach, Jack Wilson, rousted defenders into position as the corners piled up for Brighton. It seemed they might see out the first half, only for Georginio Rutter to lay up Welbeck for a simple finish, his sixth goal of the season; the evergreen Mancunian is in the form of his life. Half-time brought changes, Pablo Sarabia and Carlos Forbs for Toti and Mario Lemina, attacking changes mirroring Brighton\u2019s shape; O\u2019Neil was going for broke. Gradually, Wolves gained more territory though concurrently left space on the counter. Welbeck should have done better when Sarabia inadvertently played him through while Yasin Ayari, a buzzing presence in Brighton\u2019s midfield, also shot wide. Then came Wolves\u2019 best chance yet. Sarabia\u2019s laser-guided pass finding Cunha, the finish rather less accurate. H\u00fcrzeler made his first changes, Welbeck withdrawn for Ferguson but the chances kept falling to Wolves before Wieffer\u2019s extra height was then fatefully introduced by H\u00fcrzeler. \u201cGames like this, you don\u2019t win in a beautiful way, you have to win in an ugly way,\u201d said H\u00fcrzeler of the closing moments in which his team lost control despite the two-goal lead. \u201cWe got punished.\u201d Ferguson\u2019s goal, assisted by the fellow substitute Tariq Lamptey, could have extinguished Wolves hopes and O\u2019Neil\u2019s chances of still being their manager only for A\u00eft-Nouri to almost immediately scramble home and set up the madness that Brighton failed to cope with. \u201cToo passive,\u201d said H\u00fcrzeler.

Adventurous, brave, entertaining \u2013 yes. But porous. And, most importantly, winless.</p> <p>\u201cIt was an incredible game,\u201d said McKenna, who confirmed Chiedozie Ogbene had suffered a suspected achilles tear when he left on a stretcher after 35 minutes.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a mixture of great pride in the performance on an individual level and team level. The quality, resilience that we\u2019ve shown through a really challenging week led to so many good things in the performance.</p> <p>\u201cBut of course it\u2019s extreme disappointment, devastation about the late goal that means we don\u2019t get any points for our efforts. We showed so many things today that are back on the right track. We showed our real identity as a team. I think, although we don\u2019t have any points to show for it, it was a step in the right direction.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps his counterpart, Thomas Frank, has unintentionally stumbled across an unlikely winning formula. Brentford had taken the lead in seven of their previous eight league games, before throwing away a league-high 11 points from those positions; an alarming statistic following the unwanted record of squandering 30 points after taking the lead last season. Then again, maybe this was just one of those peculiar, unexplainable encounters. Before what appears to be a distinctly hospitable run of games in November, the hosts are now into the top half of the table.</p>    <p>\u201cWe are in the entertainment business, so I thought we had to give you a bit for your money,\u201d joked Frank, who admitted that Brentford had produced \u201c40 of our worst minutes in the Premier League\u201d to start the game.</p> <p>By that point, his side were two goals down, Ipswich striking twice in three minutes on the counterattack through Sam Szmodics and George Hirst\u2019s excellent finishes.</p> <p>From fleeting elation, the familiar flat feeling soon returned for the travelling contingent. With half-time approaching, the ever-lively Keane Lewis-Potter began a move that culminated in Yoane Wissa burying a first-time strike.</p> <p>Two minutes later, parity was restored when Wissa\u2019s shot from a tight angle came off Harry Clarke to go down as an own goal.</p> <p>Clarke\u2019s first Premier League start quickly turned into a nightmare. Soon after half-time he dragged down Lewis-Potter for what was initially deemed a free-kick but then upgraded to a penalty by the VAR. Mbeumo confidently smashed home the spot-kick.</p> <p>Clarke was booked for his troubles and his disastrous day ended early when Lewis-Potter drew him into another rash challenge, prompting a second yellow card.</p> <p>Despite Brentford\u2019s dominance, Ipswich thought they had grabbed the unlikeliest of points when Leif Davis\u2019s brilliant cross allowed substitute Liam Delap to convert. But their joy, again, was short-lived.</p> <p>Mbeumo\u2019s cross in injury time evaded everyone and Delap\u2019s strike in the final few seconds cannoned off the Brentford post to the heartache of the travelling fans. \u201cFootball is relentless,\u201d summarised a relieved Frank.</p>",

And, most importantly, winless. \u201cIt was an incredible game,\u201d said McKenna, who confirmed Chiedozie Ogbene had suffered a suspected achilles tear when he left on a stretcher after 35 minutes. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a mixture of great pride in the performance on an individual level and team level. The quality, resilience that we\u2019ve shown through a really challenging week led to so many good things in the performance. \u201cBut of course it\u2019s extreme disappointment, devastation about the late goal that means we don\u2019t get any points for our efforts. We showed so many things today that are back on the right track. We showed our real identity as a team. I think, although we don\u2019t have any points to show for it, it was a step in the right direction.\u201d Perhaps his counterpart, Thomas Frank, has unintentionally stumbled across an unlikely winning formula. Brentford had taken the lead in seven of their previous eight league games, before throwing away a league-high 11 points from those positions; an alarming statistic following the unwanted record of squandering 30 points after taking the lead last season. Then again, maybe this was just one of those peculiar, unexplainable encounters. Before what appears to be a distinctly hospitable run of games in November, the hosts are now into the top half of the table. \u201cWe are in the entertainment business, so I thought we had to give you a bit for your money,\u201d joked Frank, who admitted that Brentford had produced \u201c40 of our worst minutes in the Premier League\u201d to start the game. By that point, his side were two goals down, Ipswich striking twice in three minutes on the counterattack through Sam Szmodics and George Hirst\u2019s excellent finishes. From fleeting elation, the familiar flat feeling soon returned for the travelling contingent. With half-time approaching, the ever-lively Keane Lewis-Potter began a move that culminated in Yoane Wissa burying a first-time strike. Two minutes later, parity was restored when Wissa\u2019s shot from a tight angle came off Harry Clarke to go down as an own goal. Clarke\u2019s first Premier League start quickly turned into a nightmare. Soon after half-time he dragged down Lewis-Potter for what was initially deemed a free-kick but then upgraded to a penalty by the VAR. Mbeumo confidently smashed home the spot-kick. Clarke was booked for his troubles and his disastrous day ended early when Lewis-Potter drew him into another rash challenge, prompting a second yellow card. Despite Brentford\u2019s dominance, Ipswich thought they had grabbed the unlikeliest of points when Leif Davis\u2019s brilliant cross allowed substitute Liam Delap to convert. But their joy, again, was short-lived. Mbeumo\u2019s cross in injury time evaded everyone and Delap\u2019s strike in the final few seconds cannoned off the Brentford post to the heartache of the travelling fans. \u201cFootball is relentless,\u201d summarised a relieved Frank.",

In one of the images of Kaylin submitted into evidence at the trial, Smelko used her face from a photo posted on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/instagram\">Instagram</a> when she was 12, working on set, and superimposed it onto the naked body of someone else.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve had my fair share of crying uncontrollably because I don\u2019t understand how some people are so evil,\u201d she tells the Guardian in an interview. \u201cI can never really wrap my head around that.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related:</span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jun/12/predators-using-ai-generate-child-sexual-images\">Child predators are using AI to create sexual images of their favorite \u2018stars\u2019: \u2018My body will never be mine again\u2019</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Kaylin lives in Ventura, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california\">California</a>, and Smelko was based in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a> when he committed these crimes against her. She was shocked when she learned her case could only be brought to trial because it was an interstate crime. Possessing depictions of child sexual abuse is criminalized under US federal law. But under California state laws, it wasn\u2019t considered illegal.</p> \n<p>Kaylin turned her horror into action. This year, she became a staunch public advocate in support of a new California bill, AB 1831, that expands the scope of existing laws against child sexual abuse material (CSAM) to include images and videos that are digitally altered or generated via AI. In June, she testified in support of the bill at the state capitol in Sacramento.</p> \n<p>\u201cI talked about how I felt violated and that I was absolutely appalled that this wasn\u2019t already a crime in California,\u201d says Kaylin. \u201cCalifornia is such a huge part of the acting industry, and there are so many kids who were not protected from this crime.\u201d</p> \n<p>At the end of September, California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, signed the measure into law. Child predators creating such material can face imprisonment and fines of up to $100,000 in the state.</p> \n<p>While the new law focuses on AI in the hands of child predators, other factors in Kaylin\u2019s life put her at risk of encountering Smelko or those like him, according to her and her parents, Mark and Shalene Hayman.</p> \n<p>Kaylin was 10 years old when she first got her Instagram account. The social network <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/3237561506542117\">requires</a> that its users must be at least 13 to sign up with the exception of accounts managed by parents. Smelko downloaded photos from her profile to create sexual images that combined her face with naked bodies of other girls and women.</p> \n<p>\u201cDisney set up her Instagram account specifically to promote the show and themselves,\u201d says Mark. \u201cBut when these companies are employing these kids and making them post on there and not providing support \u2013 that\u2019s where the bigger issue lies.\u201d</p> \n<p>This support should include training on dealing with harassment and blocking accounts, and counseling, he says. Kaylin likewise lays the blame at Disney\u2019s feet.</p> \n<p>\u201cDisney\u2019s PR team had me and all of the kids at Disney sign up for an app. They used to send us clips to post on Instagram every week that an episode would come out,\u201d says Kaylin. \u201cIt started with my job and them planting that seed. I would like them to take some responsibility, but that has yet to happen.\u201d</p> \n<p>In recent years, men have harassed Kaylin via her Instagram and TikTok accounts by sending her nude photos. She has reported the unwanted messages to both social media companies, but she says no action has been taken.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s certainly had her fair share of creepy stalkers who continue to taunt her,\u201d says Shalene.</p> \n<p>Mark believes that Sag-Aftra, the Hollywood actor\u2019s union, also needs to be more proactive in educating its members on the risks of predators using AI and social media to victimize public figures. Both parents regularly check Kaylin\u2019s accounts, which she still uses and has access to.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe do read a lot of comments and think, \u2018What is wrong with people?\u2019, but I don\u2019t know if you can get away from it. It\u2019s difficult to be in this industry and not be on social media,\u201d says Shalene. \u201cI would like to see the social media companies do some responsible censoring and protections.\u201d</p> \n<p>Over the past few years, Instagram has announced several initiatives to increase protections for its users under 16, including parental controls and measures to determine who can message them. In September, the company announced it would make all accounts for users under 18 private by default, a move praised by child safety advocates. The same restrictions apply to minors\u2019 verified accounts, according to Meta\u2019s guidelines.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are so many inappropriate images circulated on Instagram. I just don\u2019t understand why they are able to be sent to kids,\u201d says Kaylin, who turns 17 this month. \u201cInstagram should be like, \u2018No, that\u2019s not allowed,\u2019 and take it down. But it doesn\u2019t happen, and I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p> \n<p>Meta said in a statement: \u201cWe have <a href=\"https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/policies/community-standards/child-sexual-exploitation-abuse-nudity/\">detailed and robust policies</a> against child nudity and exploitation, including real and images and those created using GenAI.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cSAG-AFTRA has been educating, bargaining, and legislating about the dangers of deepfake technology since at least 2018, \u201d said Jeffrey Bennett, the general counsel for Sag-Aftra.

      "bodyText": "Reflecting the instincts of a cold war veteran, Joe Biden\u2019s strategy was familiar: contain the conflict. When the US president spoke in Warsaw in March 2022, a month after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he drew a red line at Vladimir Putin\u2019s toes. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about moving on one single inch of Nato territory,\u201d he warned. The western allies would provide weapons and aid to Kyiv, impose sweeping economic and financial sanctions on Moscow and reduce the rouble to \u201crubble\u201d, Biden vowed. Though Ukraine is not a Nato member, the US would help the country win this symbolic battle for freedom and democracy. But it would not directly confront Russia unless Russia first attacked Nato. Thirty months on, Biden\u2019s containment strategy is failing miserably. Like an untreated cancer, Ukraine\u2019s crisis metastasises uncontrollably. Far from being confined to the mud and ice of the Donbas, the war\u2019s spreading, toxic fallout grows more globally destructive by the day. It contaminates and blights everything it touches. True, a \u201chot\u201d war between Russia and Nato has been avoided so far. Yet Polish and Romanian territory has been affected by stray missiles and maritime attacks. The entire Black Sea region is embroiled, as is Belarus. Putin claims that the west is already waging war on Russia and threatens it with nuclear weapons. Propagandists vow to vaporise Poland. The crisis has triggered US-Europe splits in Nato and within the EU. Rows flare over sending troops and long-range missiles to Ukraine, inviting Kyiv to join the alliance, and forging a separate European \u201cdefence identity\u201d. France\u2019s newly hawkish stance is cancelled out by German caution. Neutral Sweden and Finland were panicked into joining Nato. The Baltic republics fear renewed Russian aggression. Hungary and Serbia appease the Kremlin. Italy wavers. No one feels safe. The war is fuelling right-left political extremism as support surges for Putin\u2019s paid-for populist apologists. In Moldova, last weekend\u2019s EU membership referendum was grossly distorted by what its president, Maia Sandu, called a huge bribery operation by \u201ccriminal groups working together with foreign forces\u201d \u2013 namely, Kremlin stooges. Now Moscow is eyeing this weekend\u2019s elections in Georgia where it covertly conspires to ensure pro-western parties lose. Such hybrid warfare \u2013 subversion, disinformation, influence operations, cyber-attacks, scams, online trolling \u2013 has mushroomed worldwide since 2022, as authoritarian regimes follow Russia\u2019s lead. Failure to contain the war is encouraging seismic geopolitical shifts, most notably the China-Russia \u201cno-limits\u201d partnership. China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, gets cheap oil; ostracised Putin gets sanctions-busting dual-use tech plus diplomatic backing. But it\u2019s so much more than that. At last week\u2019s Brics summit \u2013 hosted by Putin \u2013 Russia, China, India, Brazil and South Africa were joined by Iran, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela and, alarmingly, Nato member Turkey (among many others). Putin envisages a global anti-western alliance, Xi a post-American, China-led 21st-century new world order. These are no idle dreams. For many second-tier countries, the west\u2019s condemnation of Russian aggression in Ukraine and its refusal to condemn, and active facilitation of, Israeli aggression in Palestine represents an intolerable double standard. Some are switching sides. What better illustrates the unbounded nature of this inexorably expanding conflict than the startling news that North Korea, in a breath-taking counterpoint to US and UK military intervention in the Korean war nearly 75 years ago, is deploying troops to the Ukraine theatre? And how appalling that Donald Trump can cynically use Ukraine\u2019s \u201cforever war\u201d to persuade US voters that Democrats like Kamala Harris cannot control a chaotic world, Nato is a con-trick run by freeloading Europeans and the UN is useless. The war diverts attention from other grave conflicts, from Sudan to Myanmar. Attacks on Kyiv\u2019s grain exports have caused food shortages and price spikes hurting poorer countries. It disrupts cooperative action on climate; indeed, it has greatly increased greenhouse gas emissions While Putin, indicted for war crimes, goes unpunished, respect for international law and the UN charter plummets.

He has fulminated against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/13/trump-president-agenda-climate-policy-wind-power\">windmills</a>, a frequent source of his disdain. He has conflated legal asylum, the process by which people from other countries seek protection when fleeing persecution, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/05/donald-trump-migrants-hannibal-lecter\">insane asylums</a>.

On Truth Social on Friday, he issued a lengthy, informal \u201ccease and desist\u201d message to Democrats, who he continues to insist engaged in \u201crampant Cheating and Skullduggery\u201d in 2020, depriving him of a second term. \u201cTherefore, the 2024 Election, where Votes have just started being cast, will be under the closest professional scrutiny and, WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long term prison sentences so that this Depravity of Justice does not happen again,\u201d he threatened. \u201cWe cannot let our Country further devolve into a Third World Nation, AND WE WON\u2019T! Please beware that this legal exposure extends to Lawyers, Political Operatives, Donors, Illegal Voters, &amp; Corrupt Election Officials. Those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country.\u201d His campaign is also spending big on anti-trans ads, capitalizing on a culture war issue that elicits anger in many. His campaign is blitzing the airwaves, with $29m in anti-trans ads over the past five weeks, the Bulwark reported based on AdImpact data, compared with $5m on economy-focused TV ads during the same time period. \u201cThat makes the topic, by far, the biggest focal point when it comes to Trump\u2019s ad spending \u2013 one of the best barometers of messaging priority there is,\u201d the outlet\u2019s Marc Caputo wrote. Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. Get our free app and sign up for election alerts In the final stretch of campaigning, Trump will reportedly try to rein in the rambles that have made some question his mental fitness. He has said it\u2019s an intelligent speaking style, dubbing it \u201cthe weave\u201d. The Washington Post, by comparison, called it \u201cstrikingly erratic, coarse and often confusing, even for a politician with a history of ad-libbing in three consecutive presidential runs\u201d. Over the last year, the speaking style has revealed his preoccupations to voters. Some of his comments have suggested that thinks Hannibal Lecter, the fictional cannibal, is a real person who has died. He is mad about bacon. He has fulminated against windmills, a frequent source of his disdain. He has conflated legal asylum, the process by which people from other countries seek protection when fleeing persecution, with insane asylums. He spread a false rightwing conspiracy on the presidential debate stage that migrants were eating household pets. He said Harvey Weinstein got \u201cschlonged\u201d. He complimented Arnold Palmer\u2019s penis size. His speeches are often impossible to quote directly without significant editing and context-adding. Between rambles, he has honed the racist, threatening messages he believes are his best hope for getting his old job back. The media is \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d, Kamala Harris is a \u201cshit vice-president\u201d, Joe Biden is a \u201cstupid fool\u201d and Nancy Pelosi is \u201ccrazy as a bed bug\u201d. As in 2016, he has cast himself as the only person who can fix all the problems his enemies created. \u201cWe stand on the verge of the four greatest years of the history of our country,\u201d he told his supporters in Arizona. \u201cWe will redeem America\u2019s promise. We will put America first, and we will take back the nation that we love. We\u2019re going to take it back from these people that have no idea what they\u2019re doing.\u201d With just 10 days to go until election day, Trump\u2019s campaign undoubtedly wants to keep him on message. But his track record \u2013 including a recent town hall that devolved into a 40-minute dance event \u2013 indicates he might not be capable. His last attempt to win over voters includes the message he\u2019s reiterated for four years: that his reign was stolen from him, and he\u2019s trying to get it back. His supporters need to turn out en masse to make his lead \u201ctoo big to rig,\u201d a line his fans now echo. He delivered that message during a staged appearance working a McDonald\u2019s fryer, where he would not commit to accepting the results of the election. Leaning out of the drive-thru window, he told reporters he was up in the polls. Would he accept the results of the election? \u201cIf it\u2019s a fair election,\u201d he responded.",

      "body": "<p>As the crowd of baying teenagers drew closer, clambering up on to the pool table and bar in scenes the <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-radar/sports-team-chaotic-album-launch-interview-2611607\"><em>NME</em> compared</a> to zombie film <em>World War Z</em>, I wondered if my mum hadn\u2019t been right after all that this was \u201cvery ill-conceived\u201d. It was 2020, we had just announced the debut Sports Team album <em>Deep Down Happy</em><em>,</em> and our latest single, Here\u2019s the Thing, was Radio 1\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000fgm1\">Hottest Record in the World</a>. </p> <p>We were celebrating with an impromptu gig, announced via a tweet, in an old-school Camberwell pub, the Nag\u2019s Head. A few songs in, things were getting out of hand. I spied our bass player seeking refuge atop his amp, only to lose balance \u2013 tumbling into a crash cymbal that collided with the head of our drummer. A trickle of blood ran down her forehead. The show went on. It was perfect.</p> <p>From the Beatles in 1969 on the roof of their Savile Road HQ to Prince playing to fans in Lianne La Havas\u2019s living room in 2014, the concept of a \u201cguerrilla gig\u201d \u2013 a free concert in an offbeat location \u2013 is nothing new. But at a time when stadiums are full of the same superstar names, and smaller venues are shutting, they are enjoying a resurgence. As Margate-based promoter Sammy Clarke puts it: \u201cNothing is as exciting as the idea of having a space for just one night.\u201d</p> <p>The last year has seen guerrilla gigs put on by everyone from French electronic act Air to American pop-punk band Blink-182.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely about seizing back space for people,\u201d says Clarke , who has staged shows in bowling alleys, abandoned buildings and an underground network of chalk caves. He seeks \u201ca sense of belonging that isn\u2019t overly commercialised with adverts all over the venue and extortionately priced alcohol\u201d.</p> <p>Fans are sometimes left feeling powerless in the face of ticket-company monopolies, whose surge pricing led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/sep/01/oasis-ticketmaster-in-demand-standing-tickets\">Oasis tickets costing upwards of \u00a3350</a> for the reunion tour. Bands are also feeling the pinch, frequently walking away from touring after making a loss.

      "bodyText": "As the crowd of baying teenagers drew closer, clambering up on to the pool table and bar in scenes the NME compared to zombie film World War Z, I wondered if my mum hadn\u2019t been right after all that this was \u201cvery ill-conceived\u201d. It was 2020, we had just announced the debut Sports Team album Deep Down Happy, and our latest single, Here\u2019s the Thing, was Radio 1\u2019s Hottest Record in the World. We were celebrating with an impromptu gig, announced via a tweet, in an old-school Camberwell pub, the Nag\u2019s Head. A few songs in, things were getting out of hand. I spied our bass player seeking refuge atop his amp, only to lose balance \u2013 tumbling into a crash cymbal that collided with the head of our drummer. A trickle of blood ran down her forehead. The show went on. It was perfect. From the Beatles in 1969 on the roof of their Savile Road HQ to Prince playing to fans in Lianne La Havas\u2019s living room in 2014, the concept of a \u201cguerrilla gig\u201d \u2013 a free concert in an offbeat location \u2013 is nothing new. But at a time when stadiums are full of the same superstar names, and smaller venues are shutting, they are enjoying a resurgence. As Margate-based promoter Sammy Clarke puts it: \u201cNothing is as exciting as the idea of having a space for just one night.\u201d The last year has seen guerrilla gigs put on by everyone from French electronic act Air to American pop-punk band Blink-182. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely about seizing back space for people,\u201d says Clarke , who has staged shows in bowling alleys, abandoned buildings and an underground network of chalk caves. He seeks \u201ca sense of belonging that isn\u2019t overly commercialised with adverts all over the venue and extortionately priced alcohol\u201d. Fans are sometimes left feeling powerless in the face of ticket-company monopolies, whose surge pricing led to Oasis tickets costing upwards of \u00a3350 for the reunion tour. Bands are also feeling the pinch, frequently walking away from touring after making a loss. According to figures from the Music Venue Trust, artists are playing an average of 11 shows on the UK grassroots circuit in 2024, compared with 22 in 1994. Sometimes the chance to play a particular location is just too alluring to turn down. London post-punk quartet Dry Cleaning had planned to take the summer off to focus on writing.

Shnaider won three straight games to leave the opening set at 4-3, defended three set points to hold under pressure for 5-4 and then saved another to break Zheng\u2019s serve for a second time and level at 5-5. Zheng rallied to win the tie-break, taking three consecutive points to win it 7-5. Early in the second set, Zheng\u2019s first-serve percentage dropped and Shnaider broke for 2-1, but the top seed broke right back and followed up with another for a 4-2 lead which she would not relinquish.",

      "body": "<p>The theory is that journalists should report the news rather than headline it \u2013 but on Friday the <em>Washington Post</em>, the celebrated ally of American democracy during Watergate, broke that principle. The paper <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/25/washington-post-endorsement/\">came out</a> refusing to endorse the candidate in the forthcoming election who will defend the rule of law, against the convicted criminal who has shown time and again \u2013 not least on 6 January 2021 \u2013 that he explicitly aims to overturn it. </p> <p>The <em>Post\u2019s</em> British chief executive, Will Lewis, wrote an editorial that stated the <em>Post</em> would sit on the fence for the most significant US election of modern times (bringing to mind that old truth \u201cthe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do&nbsp;nothing\u201d). </p> <p>That editorial, however, was followed by an act of open sedition from the news desk of the <em>Post</em>, which broke&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/10/25/washington-post-endorsement-president/\">the inside story</a> of the alleged influence on that decision from Jeff Bezos, the Amazon oligarch who bought&nbsp;the newspaper for $250m in 2013. </p> <p>Bezos now finds himself in what might be called the \u201clibertarian\u201d billionaire\u2019s dilemma. Having guaranteed the editorial independence of the <em>Post,</em> he can\u2019t quite be seen to shut down the current&nbsp;story of his own interference; the result is that \u2013 at a paper that trumpets \u201cdemocracy dies in darkness\u201d \u2013 the craven decision-making of owner and chief executive stand exposed for all to see. </p> <p>And for those many of us who first nurtured the idea of becoming journalists after&nbsp;watching <em>All the President\u2019s Men</em>, it is cheering to read Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein <a href=\"https://x.com/brianstelter/status/1849969817312268516\">still to the fore</a> in this latest deep throat expos\u00e9.</p> <h2 data-note-id=\"9d480b8f-a871-4388-996e-fcf5f944275f\" data-type=\"subhead\">Follow the money</h2> <p>At the Serpentine North Gallery in London\u2019s Hyde Park there is an intriguing exhibition devoted to perhaps the most consequential legal struggle of our times \u2013 the question of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/25/unjust-threat-murdoch-and-artists-align-in-fight-over-ai-content-scraping\">who owns</a> individual human creativity: are the words of writers and the melodies of musicians simply data to be \u201cscraped\u201d by AI companies, who seek to replicate them for their own profit, or should those individual human acts be protected, in the normal way, by copyright? </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/about/press/holly-herndon-and-mat-dryhurst-the-call/\">The Call</a>, a collaboration between artists Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst, dramatises this question in compelling ways \u2013 including with a cacophony of \u201cvocal datasets\u201d that are made to swell with human voices in digital concert. </p> <p>The exhibition invites the idea that, used thoughtfully, AI can help the world to sing in perfect harmony. But there&nbsp;is another age-old principle at stake here: <em>cui bono</em>, follow the money. </p> <p>If multinational conglomerates are so very keen to use all of our ideas to train their machines, the obverse has to apply: their highly guarded content-creating algorithms must also become open, for the transparent and regulated benefit of us all.</p> <h2 data-note-id=\"04604104-ded6-4e46-917c-0ced84e87cdf\" data-type=\"subhead\">Mind the Gap</h2>    <p>Few acts of vandalism have had quite the same emotional impact as the chopping down of the beloved Sycamore Gap tree in Northumberland.

In small part, I confess, this was an act of overdue contrition to all those kindly correspondents who have written to me and colleagues over the years to enquire, politely: \u201cHow many trees had to die for this bollocks to be printed?\u201d </p> <p>What better chance finally to begin to redress the balance?</p> <p>\u2022 Tim Adams is an Observer columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "The theory is that journalists should report the news rather than headline it \u2013 but on Friday the Washington Post, the celebrated ally of American democracy during Watergate, broke that principle. The paper came out refusing to endorse the candidate in the forthcoming election who will defend the rule of law, against the convicted criminal who has shown time and again \u2013 not least on 6 January 2021 \u2013 that he explicitly aims to overturn it. The Post\u2019s British chief executive, Will Lewis, wrote an editorial that stated the Post would sit on the fence for the most significant US election of modern times (bringing to mind that old truth \u201cthe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing\u201d). That editorial, however, was followed by an act of open sedition from the news desk of the Post, which broke the inside story of the alleged influence on that decision from Jeff Bezos, the Amazon oligarch who bought the newspaper for $250m in 2013. Bezos now finds himself in what might be called the \u201clibertarian\u201d billionaire\u2019s dilemma. Having guaranteed the editorial independence of the Post, he can\u2019t quite be seen to shut down the current story of his own interference; the result is that \u2013 at a paper that trumpets \u201cdemocracy dies in darkness\u201d \u2013 the craven decision-making of owner and chief executive stand exposed for all to see. And for those many of us who first nurtured the idea of becoming journalists after watching All the President\u2019s Men, it is cheering to read Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein still to the fore in this latest deep throat expos\u00e9. Follow the money At the Serpentine North Gallery in London\u2019s Hyde Park there is an intriguing exhibition devoted to perhaps the most consequential legal struggle of our times \u2013 the question of who owns individual human creativity: are the words of writers and the melodies of musicians simply data to be \u201cscraped\u201d by AI companies, who seek to replicate them for their own profit, or should those individual human acts be protected, in the normal way, by copyright? The Call, a collaboration between artists Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst, dramatises this question in compelling ways \u2013 including with a cacophony of \u201cvocal datasets\u201d that are made to swell with human voices in digital concert. The exhibition invites the idea that, used thoughtfully, AI can help the world to sing in perfect harmony. But there is another age-old principle at stake here: cui bono, follow the money. If multinational conglomerates are so very keen to use all of our ideas to train their machines, the obverse has to apply: their highly guarded content-creating algorithms must also become open, for the transparent and regulated benefit of us all. Mind the Gap Few acts of vandalism have had quite the same emotional impact as the chopping down of the beloved Sycamore Gap tree in Northumberland. In one response, the National Trust\u2019s \u201cTrees of Hope\u201d campaign invited communities to make claims to 49 sycamore saplings (one for each foot of the height of the original) to be planted in homage. On Friday, I put in a last-minute application for one of those saplings on behalf of this newspaper and its stalwart community of readers. In small part, I confess, this was an act of overdue contrition to all those kindly correspondents who have written to me and colleagues over the years to enquire, politely: \u201cHow many trees had to die for this bollocks to be printed?\u201d What better chance finally to begin to redress the balance? \u2022 Tim Adams is an Observer columnist",

He said he had not earned enough to pay income tax since 2017 and had subsequently lived off savings, small amounts from odd jobs and money from a legal settlement that is non-taxable.</p> <p>He said confusion had played a major part in his case. \u201cI was sent reminders for tax, I ignored them and they sent more and the fines kept increasing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then they sent me a letter saying, \u2018we can now see you haven\u2019t been making enough to tax so actually you\u2019re not due anything\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>He said he believed this was the end of the issue, yet a few months later he received an even larger demand. \u201cTwo or three months later they sent me a bill for \u00a33,000, not for tax due but for fines,\u201d he said. He said that the fines, combined with the struggling to restart his business during the pandemic, had left him in a \u201cdark place\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMentally I\u2019ve struggled and all of this is quite burdening. There seems to be an attitude of \u2018you are guilty unless you can prove you\u2019re innocent\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The latest figures on fines, however, do suggest their use is falling. In the previous year, 92,000 people among the lowest paid 10% of the population <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/26/hmrc-fined-184000-low-earners-for-not-filing-return-despite-no-tax-owing\">were fined by HMRC</a> for late filing of their tax return. In an attempt to deal with the issue, a new system is being introduced that gives people warnings before they are given a fine. However, tax campaigners say that delays to the new system have caused confusion and unfairness.</p> <p>\u201cThe current penalty regime will continue alongside the new regime for a few years,\u201d said Joanne Walker, a technical officer for the <a href=\"https://www.litrg.org.uk/\">Low Incomes Tax Reform Group</a>. \u201cThis has the potential to be unfair on those who remain in the current, arguably harsher, regime, especially those on low incomes as it is recognised that the new regime will be fairer.</p> <p>\u201cWe suggest that, until the new system can be introduced for everyone, HMRC should take steps to make late filing penalties fairer and more consistent for all taxpayers.\u201d</p> <p>An HMRC spokesperson said: \u201cThe government recognises that taxpayers who occasionally miss the filing deadline should not face financial penalties and reform of the system is under way. Our aim is to support all taxpayers, regardless of income, to get their tax right and avoid fines.</p> <p>\u201cThe overwhelming majority of customers file on time.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tens of thousands of people who earn too little to pay tax are still receiving hundreds of pounds in fines for failing to file a tax return on time, according to new data seen by the Observer. More than 83,000 people earning less than the threshold were issued with a \u00a3100 penalty by the tax authorities in 2021-22. Only 17,000 of those fines were later cancelled on appeal. By contrast, only 20,000 people earning \u00a3100,000 or more were penalised. Those with low incomes fare even worse when it comes to the \u00a3300 fines handed out for filing a year late. Half of all the 61,000 fines were to people who earn too little to pay tax. Some 12,000 were successful on appeal. Only 5,000 people earning more than \u00a3100,000 a year were fined. The figures have been uncovered under the Freedom of Information Act by the Tax Policy Associates (TPA) thinktank. It has raised concerns about the extent to which people who are vulnerable or facing financial hardship are being issued with the penalties for failing to submit a self-assessment tax form on time, which self-employed workers must do. Currently, anyone who earns less than \u00a312,570 does not pay income tax. There are now calls to go back to an old system in which anyone who did not pay any tax was effectively spared a fine. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful that tens of thousands of people on very low incomes, often with difficult lives, have their lives made more difficult by HMRC penalties,\u201d said Dan Neidle, the founder of TPA. \u201cWe should go back to how things were before 2010: nobody should have to pay a penalty if their income is too low for them to have a tax bill.\u201d One of the thousands to have faced the issue, a self-employed photographer who wished to remain anonymous told the Observer that he had been issued with many fines, despite the tax authorities acknowledging he did not earn enough to pay tax. He said he had not earned enough to pay income tax since 2017 and had subsequently lived off savings, small amounts from odd jobs and money from a legal settlement that is non-taxable. He said confusion had played a major part in his case. \u201cI was sent reminders for tax, I ignored them and they sent more and the fines kept increasing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then they sent me a letter saying, \u2018we can now see you haven\u2019t been making enough to tax so actually you\u2019re not due anything\u2019.\u201d He said he believed this was the end of the issue, yet a few months later he received an even larger demand. \u201cTwo or three months later they sent me a bill for \u00a33,000, not for tax due but for fines,\u201d he said. He said that the fines, combined with the struggling to restart his business during the pandemic, had left him in a \u201cdark place\u201d. \u201cMentally I\u2019ve struggled and all of this is quite burdening. There seems to be an attitude of \u2018you are guilty unless you can prove you\u2019re innocent\u2019.\u201d The latest figures on fines, however, do suggest their use is falling. In the previous year, 92,000 people among the lowest paid 10% of the population were fined by HMRC for late filing of their tax return. In an attempt to deal with the issue, a new system is being introduced that gives people warnings before they are given a fine. However, tax campaigners say that delays to the new system have caused confusion and unfairness. \u201cThe current penalty regime will continue alongside the new regime for a few years,\u201d said Joanne Walker, a technical officer for the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group. \u201cThis has the potential to be unfair on those who remain in the current, arguably harsher, regime, especially those on low incomes as it is recognised that the new regime will be fairer. \u201cWe suggest that, until the new system can be introduced for everyone, HMRC should take steps to make late filing penalties fairer and more consistent for all taxpayers.\u201d An HMRC spokesperson said: \u201cThe government recognises that taxpayers who occasionally miss the filing deadline should not face financial penalties and reform of the system is under way. Our aim is to support all taxpayers, regardless of income, to get their tax right and avoid fines. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of customers file on time.\u201d",

When you have a very bad race, exactly the same. You have to be as balanced as possible and not get carried away by the noise around, because that can bite you.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s even more true when you are driving for Ferrari, because the noise around the team is at a very high level. So whenever you do well, things are exaggerated in a good way and when you do badly it\u2019s exaggerated in a bad&nbsp;way.\u201d</p> <p>This feels an awfully stifling way of operating and a superhuman feat to carry out successfully that has a danger of bleeding over into his life. So is he flatlining away from the&nbsp;track?</p>    <p>\u201cNot at all. Come and see me at a padel game you will see that,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cI am letting myself go but then I adapt to the situation whenever I am inside the team.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve done since I was four or five years old. It\u2019s about consistency at the highest level possible because you can\u2019t avoid bad races. It\u2019s about trying to minimise them as much as possible.\u201d</p> <p>For one so relatively young, Leclerc speaks as a veteran from a career that has been far from easy but instrumental in forging his character. In 2017, we met at the Hungarian GP when Leclerc was in F2 and just 19, eyeing a place in F1. He was charming and his talent was already impossible to ignore.</p> <p>A Ferrari junior, he was taken on by Alfa Romeo in 2018 and promoted to Ferrari in 2019. It proved a revelatory season as he outraced his teammate, the four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, and took his first two wins, including Ferrari\u2019s home race in&nbsp;Monza.</p> <p>He was a world champion in waiting it seemed but, seven years on, is still waiting. Ferrari have failed to produce a title-winning car and Leclerc has wrestled the best he can, sometimes struggling but more often far outperforming the machinery. This season he has three wins and a swathe of podiums, some of which should have been beyond him. Ferrari has surely tested an even temperament.</p> <p>For Leclerc, this is not a simple matter of closing down an emotional connection with the sport he took up as a child and still adores. He was in tears this season on the last few laps of his home grand prix for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/may/26/charles-leclerc-wins-monaco-f1-gp-for-ferrari-to-delight-of-home-crowd\">debut win in Monte Carlo</a>.

The pair have long got on well. In 2019, Hamilton inherited a win in Bahrain after Leclerc was denied victory when his engine lost a cylinder while he was leading, but acknowledged his performance. \u201cYou drove great,\u201d Hamilton told him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a great future ahead of&nbsp;you.\u201d</p>    <p>It seems unlikely that either driver at the time thought they would be sharing that future at Ferrari so how does Leclerc, who says he dreamed of making it to F1 and racing against Hamilton when he was a kid, view it? \u201cI don\u2019t think there will be any problems.</p> <p>\u201cThe way of working will be different to Mercedes and this will take a little bit of time to adapt,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we are speaking about Lewis Hamilton, I am pretty sure he does not need advice on that.</p> <p>\u201cI am super excited to be working alongside him. To be, yes, learning from him but at the same time it\u2019s such an exciting challenge for me to be in the same car as such a successful driver and to be able to show what I am capable of.</p> <p>\u201cBoth of us will want to beat each other, that\u2019s the way it is in F1, but I\u2019m sure it will be a healthy competition.\u201d</p> <p>Leclerc knows about noise already but when Hamilton arrives at Ferrari it will reach an altogether different pitch and the scrutiny on how the two fierce competitors interact will be immense. Leclerc, however, is unconcerned. Balancing complex dynamics is, after all, his forte.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a great relationship and I always have a good relationship with my teammates,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about a separation between what happens on track and what happens off the track, I won\u2019t have any problems with Lewis, I am sure.\u201d</p>",

In 2019, Hamilton inherited a win in Bahrain after Leclerc was denied victory when his engine lost a cylinder while he was leading, but acknowledged his performance. \u201cYou drove great,\u201d Hamilton told him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a great future ahead of you.\u201d It seems unlikely that either driver at the time thought they would be sharing that future at Ferrari so how does Leclerc, who says he dreamed of making it to F1 and racing against Hamilton when he was a kid, view it? \u201cI don\u2019t think there will be any problems. \u201cThe way of working will be different to Mercedes and this will take a little bit of time to adapt,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we are speaking about Lewis Hamilton, I am pretty sure he does not need advice on that. \u201cI am super excited to be working alongside him. To be, yes, learning from him but at the same time it\u2019s such an exciting challenge for me to be in the same car as such a successful driver and to be able to show what I am capable of. \u201cBoth of us will want to beat each other, that\u2019s the way it is in F1, but I\u2019m sure it will be a healthy competition.\u201d Leclerc knows about noise already but when Hamilton arrives at Ferrari it will reach an altogether different pitch and the scrutiny on how the two fierce competitors interact will be immense. Leclerc, however, is unconcerned. Balancing complex dynamics is, after all, his forte. \u201cWe have a great relationship and I always have a good relationship with my teammates,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about a separation between what happens on track and what happens off the track, I won\u2019t have any problems with Lewis, I am sure.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The LNP leader, David Crisafulli, has claimed election victory to become the 41st premier of Queensland and form a majority government. The outgoing premier and Labor leader, Steven Miles, conceded that his party could not form majority government. In his victory speech, Crisafulli said he hoped to achieve \u201cgenerational government\u201d and that the LNP had achieved its biggest achievement in more than a decade. Crisafulli batted away criticism of the party\u2019s handling of abortion \u2013 refusing to rule out a conscience vote if the KAP brings forward a private member\u2019s bill on the matter. He told the crowd in Brisbane the \u201cscare\u201d campaign wouldn\u2019t \u201ccome to fruition\u201d because \u201cthis isn\u2019t America, we don\u2019t pander to extremes\u201d. Miles told the party faithful in his electorate of Murrumba he had \u201cno regrets about the campaign or [his] last 10 months as premier\u201d. He also took aim at the LNP and said: \u201cThis election finishes with many more questions about [their] plans than answers.\u201d As it now stands, the ABC\u2019s Antony Green is projecting that the LNP has secured 49 seats to form a majority and Labor 30 seats. He projects that Katter\u2019s Australian party has picked up three seats, and that One Nation and the Greens might have no representation in the next parliament. Labor senator says inner-city voters turning away from Greens The Labor senator for Queensland Murray Watt has weighed in on the state election results, arguing that voters in the inner city had turned against the Greens: Inner-city voters have turned against an arrogant and aggressive Greens party more interested in grandstanding than delivering progressive change. The ABC is projecting that One Nation will not be represented in the next parliament. The Greens might not win any seats, it projects, while Katter\u2019s Australian party is projected to have won at least three seats. It projects the LNP will win 49 seats and Labor 31. Crisafulli doesn\u2019t say if he and Miles have spoken The premier in waiting, David Crisafulli, has spoken to reporters as he walked off the stage in Brisbane after his victory speech. Asked how it felt to be the first premier to actively support the North Queensland Cowboys, he says: Now that\u2019s an achievement! Crisafulli is also asked if he had received a call from the Labor leader, Steven Miles, but says he doesn\u2019t want to say. At the conclusion of David Crisafulli\u2019s speech, he referenced Gough Whitlam\u2019s Labor party campaign song of 1972 \u2013 It\u2019s time. Wrapping up his speech, David Crisafulli has given these final remarks: We asked Queenslanders to choose hope over fear and they did. We asked Queenslanders to vote for a fresh start and they did. And now, tomorrow we get to work \u2026 We do what we say we were going to do, we don\u2019t do what we say we wouldn\u2019t do, and we have a contract with Queenslanders and we intend to honour it. And, finally, to the future. We haven\u2019t won back-to-back elections in this state since 1986, and you need to understand how important it is if you believe in the values of your political movement and the people of your state, it has to be about generational government. So we govern with humility and decency and vision and tenacity and, in doing so, we get the opportunity to govern for a longer period of time. And if we get that opportunity we can do great things for our party, for our kids, for our state. To borrow a phrase from a different era and a different political movement, it\u2019s time \u2013 it\u2019s time. It\u2019s time for a fresh start for Queensland. David Crisafulli thanks the people of Broadwater for their endorsement, and says \u201cnobody can do this job without being a local member and I\u2019m really grateful for the opportunity as well\u201d. He also thanks his family, stating that he and his wife have done a lot to shield their daughters from the spotlight. Crisafulli says that next week he will be appointed premier but is \u201cnot even the best parent in my house\u201d, thanking his wife, Tegan, for all of her support. David Crisafulli is now moving on to the thank yous, first to the people of Queensland for \u201cbacking us\u201d. He also thanks his team, and the party\u2019s three former leaders. He has a message for the party\u2019s newly elected members: To the newly elected team members, spread throughout the state, we really look forward to welcoming you to the parliament and I know your communities will embrace the opportunity for a fresh face, as part of a fresh government. David Crisafulli notes that many people voted for the LNP for the first time today and says he wants to create a state where \u201cwe have a great tolerance [and] where we are a compassionate society\u201d. I am mindful that many of those public servants and, indeed, other Queenslanders may have not voted for us tonight, they were distracted by a scare campaign. To that I say, the good news for us as a political movement and a state is that scare campaign won\u2019t be able to be run in four years\u2019 time. When all of those allegations and when all of the scare, all of the fear, doesn\u2019t come to fruition, well, then we can look to deliver a second-term LNP government. Because, friends, this isn\u2019t America. We don\u2019t pander to extremes. On the housing crisis, David Crisafulli says the LNP will remove the tax to open home ownership for young Queenslanders, stating: History will show this is a turning point to make sure that government does all it can to lower those structural cost-of-living challenges and to make sure that working Queenslanders can keep the lights on, make sure that working Queenslanders can afford to dream, to make better for their children, and we are determined to make sure that we have respect for your money, and that means a culture of budget blowouts will end. Crisafulli says his vision for Queensland centres on building \u201cgenerational infrastructure to open up opportunities\u201d and \u201cwhere this state returns to the economic powerhouse of the country\u201d. David Crisafulli is also speaking on the LNP\u2019s plan for health, stating that \u201cambulance ramping will not remain the highest in the country, at 45%\u201d. And you will know that because within 100 days, you will see what\u2019s happening in your hospital in real time, and you will have doctors and nurses back in charge of those hospitals. David Crisafulli says the LNP is \u201cdetermined to make sure that this state returns to the powerhouse we all know it can be\u201d. Of the last 12 general elections in this state, we have only won one on election night, and tonight we get to celebrate the biggest achievement we have had in over a decade. But that is not what is important about elections. Elections are about people, and it\u2019s about doing good for those who don\u2019t have a voice, and what history will show is that tonight was the turning corner of the youth crime crisis. And it will be the turning corner to mean that there are fewer victims in this state and, by Christmas, adult crime, adult time will be law. David Crisafulli begins by acknowledging the outgoing premier Steven Miles, and says: I want to start by thanking premier [Miles] for his service as deputy premier of this state and, indeed, as the premier. And to think that the son of a factory worker could be the 40th premier of his state, that tells you everything you need to know about how great Queensland is. And I want to thank Steven and his wife, Kim, for their service to Queensland. He also acknowledged those who had lost their seats tonight. The LNP leader, David Crisafulli, has made his way through a cheering crowd of party faithful, addressing them as the LNP is set to form majority government. He says that tonight, Queenslanders had \u201cvoted for a majority LNP government\u201d. At the LNP election campaign party, the LNP president, Lawrence Springborg, has arrived with the state director, Ben Riley, and told the gathered press: I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have to wait too much longer. The LNP faithful have started a chant in the main room, but it\u2019s difficult to make out from the hallway. The ABC election analyst Antony Green says it is possible the Greens will have no seats in Queensland after today\u2019s election. Expectation growing for appearance by LNP deputy leader Jarrod Bleijie Expectation is building at the LNP election night event for the arrival of the deputy leader, Jarrod Bleijie. He\u2019s expected to be the first tonight to make a speech. Later, the boss, David Crisafulli, will arrive to make his speech \u2013 likely to claim victory. Cameron Dick defends Miles\u2019s election night speech Cameron Dick has been speaking on the ABC about whether Labor has officially conceded defeat in the election. Dick defers to Steven Miles and says it is up to the party leader to do so. Asked if Miles made an error of judgment tonight with his speech, Dick says he had not \u2013 and that he was speaking from the heart and said what he thought was \u201cappropriate for the circumstances\u201d. The LNP leader, David Crisafulli, who is expected to become Queensland\u2019s next premier, is due to speak shortly at the W hotel in Brisbane, where party faithful have been gathering. The ABC is now projecting the LNP has secured 47 seats \u2013 enough to form a majority government. Here are some photos from the LNP campaign room in Brisbane, as the results filter through: The ABC is now projecting 46 seats for the LNP \u2013 one away from a majority. It is projecting 32 for Labor, one for the Greens, three for Katter\u2019s Australian party and one for a minor party/independent. Former premier Borbidge says LNP \u2018nearly there\u2019 The Courier Mail is reporting that the former premier Rob Borbidge says the LNP\u2019s results tonight should not be underestimated: Winning 14 [extra] seats in a 93-seat parliament was always going to be a challenge, and it looks like we\u2019re nearly there \u2026 I think the law and order issue at the end of the day was a gamechanger and a vote changer for people, because it affects people, and if people have been hurt in that manner, they want it fixed and they want something done. Cameron Dick says it\u2019s still unclear if LNP can form a majority The deputy Labor leader, Cameron Dick, is speaking on the ABC following Steven Miles\u2019 speech and has provided his interpretation: I think it is unclear whether the LNP can form a majority and given what David Crisafulli has said about not forming a minority government, I think quite fairly Steven\u2019s saying we want to know there is 47 in the bag for the LNP, that there\u2019s a majority, and if he\u2019s not going to form a minority government we continue on \u2026 He is saying what everyone in the Labor party thinks tonight after everyone thought we were going to be absolutely smashed to rubble \u2026 Steven Miles says that \u201cwhatever the final number of seats, I will keep doing what matters for Queensland\u201d. Wrapping up his speech amid loud cheers of support from party faithful, the outgoing Labor premier says: I will never stop fighting for our Labor agenda. And I will never stop holding the LNP to account. Thank you all so much for your support. Steven Miles is now taking aim at the incoming LNP premier, David Crisafulli, saying: David Crisafulli ducked and weaved and tied himself into the tiniest small target Queensland has ever seen. Never before has a party taken to an election with so little detail of their agenda. This election finishes with many more questions about the LNP\u2019s plans than answers. Will he give back billions of dollars to multinational coal companies? Will he savage the public service \u2013 doctors and nurses, ambos, teachers, firies \u2013 just like he did with Campbell Newman last time to pay for his promises? Will he have a conscience vote on the Katter\u2019s abortion bill and allow that right to be stripped from Queenslanders? Addressing the cheering crowd, Steven Miles says he is proud of the progressive policy agenda he put forward: I said at the beginning of this that I wasn\u2019t going to die wondering, and I stand by that tonight \u2026 The biggest cost-of-living relief package of any state ever, paid for by billionaire multinational coal companies; $1,000 off every Queenslander\u2019s energy bill \u2026 He mentions the satellite hospitals, free children\u2019s lunches and more, stating good leaders \u201cdon\u2019t just help with now, they have a plan for the future\u201d. This election I sought a mandate in my own right to do the big structural changes that will benefit Queenslanders for generations. Steven Miles thanks his deputy, Cameron Dick, saying he \u201cknow[s] a thing or two about being a deputy premier and Cameron has been a good one\u201d. He also thanks the Queensland trade union movement for \u201ceverything you have done to support our campaign\u201d, and \u201cmost of all\u201d he thanks his family. Steven Miles congratulates those who won their seats, and for the volunteers who supported the campaign. He thanks Labor\u2019s state secretary, Katie Flanders, for an \u201cexceptional campaign, bringing people together from all different backgrounds and turning them into a united, thriving team\u201d. No regrets about campaign, Miles says Steven Miles says more will be known as counting continues in the coming days, with many seats too close to call. He says it is an \u201cextraordinary result\u201d given what the party was up against: It was always going to be a challenging election for Labor but I have no regrets about the campaign or indeed the last 10 months as premier. Addressing the party faithful in Murrumba, the Labor leader, Steven Miles, has conceded he won\u2019t form a majority government. As he took the stage with his family, there were loud cheers throughout the room. He told those gathered that he gave the election everything he had: Being Queensland\u2019s premier for 10 months has been the greatest honour of my life. For that kid from Petrie it is more than I could ever have dreamed of. Watching the results tonight it is clear that that hasn\u2019t been enough to secure a majority of seats for Labor, and also that the LNP is unlikely to have a majority. The Labor leader and premier, Steven Miles, has arrived at the campaign party in Murrumba Downs Tavern in his electorate, where he is expected to speak in a moment. Cameron Dick says it would be \u201cvery, very difficult for [Labor] to form government\u201d, but pointed to David Crisafulli\u2019s comments that he wouldn\u2019t lead a minority government. Because of that, does he think Steven Miles won\u2019t necessarily concede? Dick tells the ABC: I don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s see what he has to say and we need to give him that opportunity. Palaszczuk says it is a matter for Miles if he wishes to run for opposition leader The former premier Annastacia Palaszczuk says it is \u201ca matter for [Steven Miles]\u201d if he wants to run for opposition leader. As the Courier Mail reports, she said: Let\u2019s wait and see. He\u2019ll give that some thought, but the result tonight is a credit to him. The whole team, party office, Kate Flanders also did a great campaign with their social media team and all the candidates. There\u2019s a lot of candidates and members who have lost their seats. So when you put yourself forward for public office, you want to do a community service, but also to spend time away from your family, and I just commend everyone who\u2019s been out there working on the campaign, on all sides of politics. LNP top brass begin to arrive at election night party LNP top brass have started to arrive at their party celebration this evening. The Brisbane lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, has entered the building, but has yet to speak on camera. The manager of opposition business, Andrew Powell, spoke to Nine a few minutes ago, and said: All I can say is that in Glasshouse I\u2019m the most popular MP since 2013 and that\u2019s saying something. Powell said \u201cwe always knew there was going to be three counts\u201d \u2013 on the day, pre-poll and postals. The veteran MP was not ready to call an outcome yet, and said: What this is showing is what we\u2019ve always said which is if we won, it would be close. The deputy Labor leader, Cameron Dick, speaking on the ABC, says he has had a \u201cbrief exchange\u201d with Steven Miles ahead of his expected concession speech in the next 10 minutes. Dick says this is \u201ca speech Steven would never have wanted to give\u201d. But that is the nature of politics and we have to respect ultimately this incredible democracy that we have in Queensland, and what it has given our state for 160 years \u2026 Respecting the people\u2019s choice today is just so important \u2026 If we can hold 35 seats, I just think it is a testament to the strength and the resilience of our members. The Labor leader, Steven Miles, is expected to address party faithful at the Murrumba Downs Tavern in his electorate within the next 10 minutes, amid projections the LNP will form government and win the election. We\u2019ll bring you the latest as soon as he begins speaking. The Courier Mail reports that KAP\u2019s Robbie Katter has done \u201cno deal\u201d, when asked if he favours Steven Miles or David Crisafulli. He told Nine: It\u2019s about who is going to back north Queensland, it\u2019s pretty simple. We go to whichever side will turn around these policies that have destroyed industries up here and who will invest in infrastructure in north Queensland. Labor has done such a bad job running this state for so long. But David Crisafulli has done himself a disservice in the way he has conducted himself in the past week-and-a-half. The election analyst Kevin Bonham writes that the LNP would be \u201cvery unlucky not to get a majority from here\u201d. The ABC is projecting the LNP will form government and David Crisafulli will become the 41st premier of Queensland. Labor\u2019s Cameron Dick is asked if the party can be a credible opposition with 35 seats, and responds: We showed that we could be credible opposition with seven and destroy Campbell Newman with seven, so we have five times [as many] \u2026 I think we\u2019ll see a replay of that film. David Crisafulli has no answers on abortion, their energy plan has been absolutely shredded during the campaign \u2026 they\u2019ve got no answers on debt. Bancroft MP predicts \u2018surprises will keep coming\u2019 with postal votes If you were going by polls that consistently predicted a Labor wipeout for months \u2013 until suddenly they didn\u2019t \u2013 tonight\u2019s results have been full of surprises. But newly re-elected Labor MP in the northern Brisbane seat of Bancroft, Chris Whiting, is predicting \u201ca couple more surprises\u201d over the next few days as postal votes flip seats both sides might go to bed tonight thinking they hold. \u201cThe surprises are going to keep coming,\u201d he said from the Murrumba Downs Tavern. Still, Whiting was under no illusion about the fact Labor would lose its majority. Cameron Dick himself said he would be surprised if we won. And there was never any doubt about the task we had ahead. There have been huge cheers at the LNP party this evening as Sky News called the election for the opposition. \u201cDC, DC, DC, DC,\u201d young members of the party cheered at a huge television screen. The party has been relatively sedate this evening with no locked in win to celebrate. But as pre-poll numbers came in, several seats have begun to firm up. A number of LNP hard heads have told the Guardian they\u2019re predicting a narrow majority. The crowd quickly turned to boos when Bob Katter appeared on the TV. The final result \u2013 whether majority or minority \u2013 is yet to be determined and several seats will come down to the wire. LNP MP says mere mention of abortion in parliament won\u2019t necessarily mean conscience vote Circling back to LNP MP John-Paul Langbroek\u2019s interview on Sky News earlier. As the Brisbane Times reports, he was questioned on whether MPs would be granted a conscience vote on abortion if it comes before parliament, and responded: Just mentioning the word abortion in the parliament doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it always has to be a conscience vote. I mean, my sense was that if you\u2019re talking about saying, we\u2019re going to talk about recriminalising it, that sort of debate would be one where you would say, that\u2019s not actually about the issue itself. That\u2019s not a life and death issue, and we\u2019re prepared to say we\u2019re not going to recriminalise it, therefore that\u2019s not a life and death matter, and it won\u2019t be a conscience vote. That\u2019s just my personal view, having watched it over the last couple of weeks. The ABC\u2019s Antony Green is projecting that the Liberal National party will form government in Queensland. Labor Townsville MP says LNP push on youth justice cost him his seat The Labor MP for Townsville, Scott Stewart, has conceded defeat in the election, with the LNP\u2019s Adam Baillie set to win the seat. Stewart spoke to the ABC and said he had come in second place, thanking the people of Townsville for their support over the past 10 years. Asked why voters have turned away from Labor, he responded: It is clear in Townsville, this has always been fought around that youth justice issue and while we have had a number of great policies and the funding that goes behind it, this has been the key issue and people said to me they want it stopped and they want to give someone else a go \u2026 This has been a key issue fought on, and we know that the LNP have certainly hedged their bets on this one issue. Stewart said issues of youth justice couldn\u2019t have a \u201csilver bullet approach\u201d when asked if Labor acted too slowly: Not one thing is going to fix this complex issue that has been building for decades and generations. LNP MP says questions on abortion could have been handled better by party leader Sky News is reporting that the LNP\u2019s John-Paul Langbroek has conceded questions on abortion could have been handled better by David Crisafulli. Speaking to Sky, Langbroek said he had \u201cno doubt\u201d the issue had cost votes: There\u2019s just no doubt about the fact that it took a while to get a definitive answer about the issue \u2026 We must have thought that we didn\u2019t think this was going to be an issue that was resonating and then through relentless Labor campaigning and a lot of social media I think it obviously did. Labor\u2019s Crawford says he\u2019s still in the running in Barron River The Labor MP Craig Crawford has told party members he is in the running to retain his seat of Barron River, according to the ABC: [Scrutineers] are reporting that we are holding on to Barron River so it\u2019s going to be tight \u2026 you don\u2019t get the government without my seat. Election analysis from Ben Raue The election analyst Ben Raue, from the Tally Room, says that among the 12 Labor seats on margins of 7% to 12%, Labor is leading in every seat. The ABC has called Maryborough for Labor. Raue thinks Labor is also \u201cwell ahead\u201d in Cooper, Ferny Grove, Murrumba and Bulimba, writing: They\u2019re leading by a decent lead but not quite as big in five others. Only in two of these seats is it very close \u2013 Capalaba and Rockhampton. Things are much messier in the seats under a 7% margin, but Labor is still leading in many seats. Labor is leading in 10 of these 18 seats, the LNP is leading in eight. So on those numbers, right now Labor has regained Ipswich West and South Brisbane, and is trailing in eight others. That would be a net loss of six, which would leave them on 45 seats. There are 11 others where the ALP lead is quite narrow. If they lost all of those seats, that would give the LNP a majority. Labor MP Brittany Lauga concedes defeat The Courier Mail is reporting that the Labor MP for Keppel, Brittany Lauga, has conceded defeat, telling supporters: I feel your heart breaking, because my heart has broken too. We have worked so hard for our community. Photos from Labor\u2019s Murrumba Downs Tavern campaign party Here are some more photos rolling in from Labor\u2019s campaign party at the Murrumba Downs Tavern, in the Murrumba electorate of the premier, Steven Miles: Antony Green says there is a 5.6% swing to the LNP at the moment, with a 5.7% swing needed for a majority. It is still looking like the LNP will win more seats, but it is not clear if it will get to majority, and there\u2019s a lot more counting to come. The ABC election analyst, Antony Green, says that the LNP could still win a majority. Just earlier, he said: I think they can reach majority, but it isn\u2019t there yet. At this stage, I would say they have a better chance of finishing with more seats than Labor. So that is what the picture may be by the end of the evening. Mood remains high in Murrumba despite projections Labor has lost majority The ABC psephologist Antony Green may have declared Queensland Labor has officially lost its majority \u2013 but that hasn\u2019t dampened the mood at Murrumba Downs Tavern where party faithful are awaiting the local MP and current premier, Steven Miles. \u201cTake that Bianca!\u201d yells a voice from the crowd as the Gold Coast seat of Gaven is called for rising Labor star Meaghan Scanlon, who fended off a swing from the former Sunrise TV reporter Bianca Stone. \u201cYeah Bart!\u201d yells another, as the count in the Brisbane seat of Aspley shows the transport minister, Bart Mellish, ahead with 36.8% of the vote counted there. \u201cIt feels good,\u201d the Australia Post courier and Transport Workers Union member Bradley Begozzi says. It feels better than the polls said it would be. His wife, Robyn, who cares for their three children \u2013 their youngest non-verbal \u2013 says the family has really been feeling the cost-of-living crunch and has benefited from Labor\u2019s $1,000 energy rebate and stands to benefit from its free school lunch policy should they scrape into a minority government. Bradley says: Cost of living has been the biggest issue of the campaign. And Steven has been really strong on that. The LNP\u2019s star candidate, Amanda Stoker, has said the party \u201cshould look at\u201d nuclear power, in a stunning interview that breaks ranks with the party\u2019s position just hours after the polls have closed. The issue of nuclear power has split the state and federal LNP. Peter Dutton is pushing for it federally. David Crisafulli has ruled it out, and has said \u201cit\u2019s not part of our plan\u201d. Just as with abortion, throughout the campaign LNP candidates have been steadfast in sticking to the party line. Stoker is a former federal senator who has previously been supportive of nuclear. She\u2019s kept her head down during the campaign. Interviewed on ABC, the likely new member for Oodgeroo, Stoker began by saying it was not part of the plan, but eventually broke ranks: I have always been open-minded to whatever the science takes us to see. Now, lots of other countries use nuclear, Australia doesn\u2019t. If it became a part of the federal scene we should look at it. But we have a commitment as a team that it isn\u2019t in the plan. LNP\u2019s Stoker asked if she would like to see changes to abortion laws Amanda Stoker, the LNP candidate for Oodgeroo, is expected to win the seat. She is speaking with the ABC, and is asked if she would like to see changes to the laws in Queensland regarding abortion: The LNP\u2019s position on this has been clear \u2013 it is not going to change. I am disappointed that Labor were able to frighten so many people across Queensland into a position that really doesn\u2019t reflect the pain points for people day to day in our community. As we\u2019re reported previously, David Crisafulli has claimed the laws will not change \u2013 but he cannot rule this out if he cannot rule out a conscience vote. Shadow treasurer questioned on LNP view of federal opposition nuclear plan Sticking with energy policy for a moment and the shadow treasurer, David Janetzki, was just questioned on the federal opposition\u2019s nuclear plans. Asked if the LNP position is still no nuclear power in Queensland, he responds: Our position has been that it is a decision for Canberra, it is not for us, it\u2019s not part of our plan \u2026 We\u2019re not looking at it, it is one for our federal colleagues. David Crisafulli has previously said he would oppose Peter Dutton\u2019s plan for two nuclear plants in Queensland if elected. Janetzki is asked what he would do if Dutton wins and wants to roll out nuclear in Queensland, and says: That is hypothetical, heaped on hypothetical \u2026 We have said all the way through it is not part of our plan and that remains the case. Watt says federal Labor can learn from \u2018strong, bold agenda\u2019 in Queensland The federal Labor minister Murray Watt has told Sky News that one key takeaway from the Queensland election is the benefit of a \u201cstrong, bold agenda\u201d. According to the Brisbane Times, Watt told the program: I think we\u2019ll obviously have a good look at the Queensland election result here to see the lessons that can be gained. He also said if David Crisafulli and the LNP win, there will be \u201ca massive conflict between federal and the state LNP\u201d. I think Peter Dutton needs to learn that there is a price to be paid by not giving people straight answers in the way that he\u2019s continuing to refuse talking to people about the cost of nuclear power and a range of other issues there. Early figures could change substantially once pre-polling counted It\u2019s important to keep in mind that the early figures we\u2019re seeing tonight could change substantially when pre-poll votes are counted. That doesn\u2019t mean that they will. But while there\u2019s a lot we already know tonight, there\u2019s even more we don\u2019t. At the start of October, polls showed the LNP on course for a landslide win. By election day things got much tighter. Tonight they are tighter still. Labor\u2019s primary vote \u2013 which is up over 34% \u2013 is higher than any poll has predicted for the past few years. We absolutely expect that early voting likely favoured the LNP. The logic is that these voters were eager to chuck the government out, and had made their minds up. LNP folks are saying \u201cwait for the pre-polls\u201d before writing off the party\u2019s chances of winning a majority tonight. Shadow treasurer reiterates Crisafulli comments there will be \u2018no deals\u2019 The shadow treasurer, David Janetzki, is asked about the LNP position if there is a hung parliament. He says \u201cno deals, we want to get through the count\u201d. As Ben Smee noted earlier, the opposition leader, David Crisafulli, said \u201ccategorically\u201d yesterday he would not form a minority government if his party polled fewer than the 47 seats needed to win. Janetzki told the ABC just a moment ago there is \u201cso much counting left to go\u201d: I\u2019m still really hopeful \u2026 I\u2019m not going to get into any hypotheticals \u2026 No deal \u2026 But if Robbie Katter says we will back you on supply and confidence, that isn\u2019t a deal, that\u2019s just a handshake? But Janetzki repeats: \u201cNo deals.\u201d We are a long way from having any of those considerations, none of it, because there\u2019s going to be no deals \u2026 I want to see majority Liberal National government first. The ABC election analyst, Antony Green, is predicting Labor has lost its majority. Here is where the ABC\u2019s projections currently stand: LNP: 37 seats Labor: 32 seats Katter\u2019s Australian party: 2 seats Greens: 1 Other (minor party/independent): 1 Earlier, the federal sports minister, Anika Wells, said she still thinks a Labor win is \u201coptimistic\u201d. Here\u2019s a look at the mood inside Labor\u2019s campaign party at Murrumba Downs Tavern: Speaking to the ABC, Wayne Swan is asked if he is concerned by the biggest swings against Labor occurring in outer suburbs \u2013 and what might happen nationally? He says the next federal election will be \u201cwon in many of those outer suburbs and regional areas\u201d. But Labor\u2019s got room to make tremendous gains in Queensland in the next federal campaign, and what the results of tonight show is that it is indeed possible \u2013 if we get the right infrastructure and the right policy mix in place and talk about it effectively. The spectacular success of this campaign has been the strength for Labor of the under-40s vote, and to some extent they have taken that away from the Greens as well tonight. Swan says swing to Labor shows \u2018rejection of Trump, anti-abortion segment of LNP\u2019 Wayne Swan, the federal president of the Labor party, is speaking to ABC TV from the party\u2019s campaign party at Murrumba Downs Tavern. (We had more from Swan earlier in the blog, here.) As the two-hour mark approaches, Swan is asked if there is a prospect of Labor holding up tonight? He says \u201cthere may be\u201d, and that this has been the \u201cmost exciting and one of the most effective campaigns seen in Queensland since the 1989 campaign that knocked the National party out\u201d. Whether they get the numbers tonight we may not know, but what we do know is that the swing to Labor during the last month or two has been strong and has been on the back of the cost-of-living initiatives that the government has put in place. And I think it also shows rejection of the conservative style, Trump/Republican anti-abortion segment of the LNP in Queensland. Optimism abounds in Murrumba \u2013 far from the downer many were expecting \u201cBundy, we\u2019ve held Bundy!\u201d yells an excitable voice in the Murrumba Downs Tavern. Too excitable, as it turns out \u2013 as of 7.35pm only 18.1% of the vote in the ultra-marginal Labor-held seat had been counted, with the incumbent, Tom Smith, only narrowly ahead on 50.7%. It\u2019s way too early to call, the 17-year-old North Lakes volunteer Isa Bowen soon realises. Still, they are starting to get hyped: The odds were really against us in so many areas, so seeing Bundy so close \u2026 I\u2019m hoping this means we can retain a lot of the key seats and people we will need to be an effective opposition. I put in a lot of calls to Bundy. And the buzz is starting to build. \u201cIt\u2019s early days,\u201d another punter says, \u201cbut this is a good place to be.\u201d A roar goes up with early counts showing a big swing to Labor in the Greens-held seat of South Brisbane. Whatever happens, Murrumba Downs is far from the downer many were expecting not so long ago. Labor appears to be largely holding its ground \u2013 at least in terms of the election night figures \u2013 in the \u201cPalaszczuk pensioners\u201d seats that helped the party win a majority at the 2020 Covid election. The caveat for these places, like the rest of the state, is that large numbers of people voted early, and the polls seemed to tighten late \u2013 so numbers on the night are very much subject to change. But in Bundaberg, Nicklin, Redcliffe, Caloundra and Pumicestone, the two-party preferred numbers are not showing big swings to the LNP. We had even expected there would be a natural realignment in these places, even before the statewide swing comes into play. Reminder that Crisafulli \u2018categorically\u2019 ruled out forming minority government An important reminder at this point, as the early results show a complicated count and the potential for a hung parliament. The opposition leader, David Crisafulli, said \u201ccategorically\u201d yesterday he would not form a minority government if his party polled fewer than the 47 seats needed to win. Of course, it\u2019s a time-honoured tradition for political leaders to say things like \u201cno deals\u201d in order to encourage voters to hand them the keys without the complication of having to negotiate with a crossbench. But Crisafulli\u2019s comments on the matter were more strident than usual. He may be beginning to worry they\u2019ll come back to bite him. Deputy premier says Greens \u2018overpromised and underdelivered\u2019 to Labor\u2019s benefit Back on the ABC\u2019s election panel, the deputy premier, Cameron Dick, is asked if he is shocked by the results so far, and responds: By this time of the broadcast I thought we were going to be in deep trouble and that we would all be preparing a particular speech to give \u2013 and that is not the case. And I think the LNP will be alarmed by Ipswich West, because it goes to one of the most important issues in the campaign, which is the more people saw [opposition leader] David Crisafulli, the less they liked him \u2026 Has the premier, Steven Miles, written two speeches? Dick says he doesn\u2019t know, but \u201cwe are all waiting to see what happens\u201d. On the Greens, in a seat like Cooper, we are seeing basically a direct transfer, almost, from the Greens to Labor. And on the two-party preferred \u2026 the Greens [are] down six, Labor up six. I think the Greens have overpromised and underdelivered and I think we may be the beneficiary of that. Dick also says the Legalise Cannabis party was polling very strongly and \u201cI think that could be a really significant factor\u201d. The story of the election so far is a statewide swing to the LNP and some places in regional Queensland where Labor has clearly lost \u2013 three seats in Townsville, Keppel, Mackay and Rockhampton. Earlier, the deputy premier, Cameron Dick, said \u201cit would be a surprise for Queensland Labor to win the election\u201d. But there are also quite a few bright spots for Labor. The party is in the contest in Bundaberg, which was the state\u2019s most marginal seat, and leading in Gaven, where the highly regarded housing minister, Meaghan Scanlon, is defending her seat on the Gold Coast. Labor could pick up Ipswich West from the LNP and might even \u2013 unexpectedly \u2013 win back South Brisbane from the Greens. And while there had been some predictions the Greens could even pick up seats, the early results seem to show Labor holding firm in the seats being targeted by the minor party: Cooper, Greenslopes and Miller. As the ABC\u2019s Antony Green has said: \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s going to be a long night.\u201d Shadow youth justice minister set to retain seat and remains committed to \u2018adult crime, adult time\u2019 The ABC says that Laura Gerber, the LNP MP for Currumbin, will easily retain her seat. Gerber, who is the shadow youth justice minister, spoke to the broadcaster and said the party remains committed to \u201cadult time for adult crime\u201d. Asked about criticism from those who say imposing longer sentences and placing children in an already struggling detention system would not reduce offending, the MP said \u201cnot everyone is going to agree with everything that we put forward\u201d. \u2026 We are doing detention with a purpose, we\u2019re doing circuit breaker sentencing, giving judges other options aside from either putting kids back into our community \u2013 which is what invariably happens \u2013 or putting them into detention, they can send them to circuit breaker sentencing for rehabilitation and to work with their families. Nestled between a service station and a Maccas on a six-lane road off the Bruce Highway in Brisbane\u2019s outer north, Labor faithful are awaiting the arrival of \u2013 for now at least \u2013 the Queensland premier, Steven Miles. Among the sea of red is the party\u2019s national president and former federal treasurer Wayne Swan, who spent the day at several booths in Stafford, an electorate held by the party on a margin of 11.9%. He says it was \u201creally quiet\u201d. If you were expecting big throngs of people with baseball bats, well, there was none of that. It didn\u2019t have the feel of a huge change-of-government election. But Swan concedes the party has a \u201cbig mountain to climb to win a fourth term\u201d. We\u2019ve been underdogs, and we remain underdogs. Regardless of the result, the party heavyweight says Queensland Labor had \u201crun a really strong, values-based campaign\u201d and \u201cexposed the small target\u201d of opposition leader, David Crisafulli, and the LNP. Particularly their US-style culture war position on abortion. The ABC has now projected 19 seats for the LNP, nine for Labor, two for Katter\u2019s Australian party, one for the Greens and one for a minor party/independent. 5.3% swing to LNP on early polling: Antony Green Antony Green, the ABC\u2019s election analyst, says there is a 5.3% swing to the LNP on early polling. It needs 5.7% to change government. LNP feeling increasingly comfortable amid early results Really, really early results still, but feedback from across the board is the LNP is feeling increasingly comfortable. Take, for example, Chermside West, which is the only booth to report back in the bellwether seat of Aspley. The LNP wants to win it. Labor thought it might have a chance, particularly given the impact of the abortion debate and 50c public transport fares. In Chermside West the Labor vote is down 10%; the LNP is up 9%. It\u2019s a big seat, and a big state. But the little flecks so far are mostly good news for the LNP in search of a majority. The ABC has already begun calling a number of seats, so far projecting seven for the LNP and one for Labor (Ferny Grove). Early Rockhampton numbers are 10% swing on primaries Rockhampton is one of the few seats where we\u2019ve got results from election day booths. Labor has held the seat for almost 100 years, but is looking shaky. Early numbers are a 10% swing on primaries. The big question is who will capitalise. The independent Margaret Strelow (a former Labor member, and a former mayor) and the LNP are both still in that contest. They\u2019ve directed preferences to each other. Katter asked about plans in case of minority government Robbie Katter is also asked about the possibility of a minority government, and whether the KAP would only do a deal with the LNP. He responds that \u201cyou would be a fool as a minor party, saying we will only deal with one side\u201d. If you say you will never do a deal with one side, you have nothing to negotiate, you have no leverage, and you can\u2019t go to the people in government and say, \u2018we want X, Y, Z, a new dam or upgrades or whatever it is\u2019 \u2013 you can\u2019t demand that if you have already picked a side before getting to the dealing table \u2026 It is whoever will come along with north Queensland and pick us, not who we would pick. Robbie Katter is speaking on ABC TV, and is asked whether he is confident of increasing his presence in parliament. He responds: All I can say is I hope so \u2026 It is very difficult as a minor party, particularly when you occupy seats full of troubles that you are pretty bogged down in consistent work, rather than being in the media all the time and trying to promote your party. He is asked to clarify what legislation he would introduce, regarding a private member\u2019s bill on abortion. Katter says he would put bring back the Babies Born Alive bill and beyond that was \u201cwilling to test something in parliament\u201d. And there are so many combinations \u2026 of what could be done, whether it is repeals, amendments, new bills \u2026 It wasn\u2019t a priority for me to pin down because I didn\u2019t go to the election with this as an issue, but the propositions were put to me. LNP MP says party up against challenge \u2018taller than Everest\u2019 The shadow minister David Janetzki was also up on ABC TV, and said the LNP was facing a challenge \u201ctaller than Everest\u201d. Looking back over the last 30 to 35 years in Queensland political history, we have won once on the night since 1986 \u2026 That tells you the Everest we are climbing, perhaps even taller than Everest, but that is what we\u2019re up against. The deputy premier, Cameron Dick, has said it would be a \u201csurprise\u201d for Queensland Labor to win the election. Speaking on an ABC TV election night panel, he said: As difficult as it is for me to say, I think it would be a surprise for Queensland Labor to win the election. That is my belief. But Queensland politics is very volatile and unpredictable and anything is possible, but I do think it is a challenge for us to get over the line tonight. Dick said that from where Labor was to where it is now, it has been \u201can enormous improvement for us\u201d. We were facing an absolute wipeout last year \u2026 I think the observations are right that we won the campaign, and so it has tightened up enormously. But I think it is going to be difficult. Party supporters gather for election night The major parties will gather with their candidates and supporters tonight to watch the results of the election roll in. David Crisafulli and the LNP will be at the W hotel in Brisbane. The premier, Steven Miles, is at a venue in his electorate of Murrumba. Miles and Crisafulli thank supporters and volunteers as polls close The premier, Steven Miles, and opposition leader, David Crisafulli, have both issued thanks to their supporters and volunteers as the polls officially closed. Miles shared a photo to X from his final stop on the campaign trail, Mango Hill, and wrote: Huge thank you to everyone who has voted for me to keep doing what matters for Queensland. Crisafulli thanked \u201cevery one\u201d of the LNP volunteers for \u201call your efforts to deliver a Fresh Start for Queensland\u201d. Katter\u2019s Australian party is weighing up taking legal action over election signage \u201clies\u201d displayed at their electorates today. The signs, reading \u201cThey\u2019ve done a deal. Don\u2019t risk it\u201d, accused the party of being in bed with Labor. They were reportedly displayed at every polling booth in every electorate contested by the party. Robbie Katter has said: Lies and mudslinging are the refuge of the intellectually bankrupt \u2013 it\u2019s what you do when you have nothing else left. While the KAP are promoting positive policy changes, solutions to crime, nation-building infrastructure, or desperately needed road improvements, the Brisbane-based opposition have demonstrated that they are more intent to drag others down, rather than present a real reason to vote for them. If this is the way they intend on governing the state, it\u2019s a really poor sign \u2013 and to think that the opposition leader himself was asking voters to vote for hope and not fear \u2013 well there\u2019s no hope in their message for north Queensland. The KAP says it asked the Electoral Commission of Queensland to order the signs be taken down, but the request was refused. The party is now holding talks with lawyers \u2013 but with polls closed, the damage, if any, is done. Counting under way Preliminary counting has now commenced, after polls closed just minutes ago. The electoral commissioner, Pat Vidgen, says the Electoral Commission of Queensland has now begun counting millions of votes: Queenslanders have had their say, choosing a variety of ways to vote including almost 1 million voting on election day and almost 2 million people voting early, by postal vote or other methods. The final voter turnout will be determined after the postal vote return deadline on 5 November, and when the scrutiny of declaration votes is completed. Vidgen says: Votes are counted by hand by election staff in the presence of scrutineers. There are millions of ballot papers to count, and they are all counted more than once, to ensure accuracy of the results. It\u2019s hit 6pm in Queensland, meaning voting in the state election has officially ended. Counting will now begin, with \u201cthe unofficial preliminary count and the indicative count\u201d tonight and the official count beginning tomorrow morning, the Electoral Commission of Queensland says. More from the seat of McConnel The member for McConnel, Labor MP Grace Grace, holds the seat on an 11% margin, and has held the seat for all but two years since 2007. But as AAP reports, this is a situation the Greens candidate, Holstein Wong, has been on a mission to change. Grace said she was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d at the polling booth today: The Greens tried last time, but I\u2019m a very solid, strong candidate and have lived here all my life. However, Wong believes she could win the seat thanks to voters who are disenchanted with the major parties: I\u2019m quietly optimistic that our team has done the groundwork over the last six months to talk to as many people in McConnel as possible. Grace said the abortion issue might help her support after the opposition was plagued for weeks over questions about whether it would allow a conscience vote on any private bill to repeal reproductive rights laws. A lot of women are saying to me they can\u2019t believe that it is actually a possibility that we could be criminalising abortion again. Volunteers from the three main parties report an extraordinarily quiet election day, with a record number casting their ballot early \u2013 just under 2 million people, as we flagged earlier. The Greens are struggling to wrest the seats of Cooper and McConnel from the Labor government. The Cooper candidate Jonty Bush and former MP Kate Jones were spotted at St Finbarr\u2019s school, normally one of the busiest in the seat. But booths in both seats were virtually deserted by voters this afternoon, according to campaigners. Two alleged incidents at polling booths today Police have reportedly responded to two incidents at polling booths today. Queensland police said they were called to a polling booth at Kawana Waters state college at aout 10am after reports of a public nuisance incident. Police said a 70-year-old Sunshine Coast man was given a move on direction. And according to the Courier Mail, police were also called to the Alexandra Hills state high school polling booth after a man allegedly wielded a pipe and approached volunteers, swearing about abortion and the state\u2019s laws. No charges were laid and nobody was injured, according to the report. Charity worker running for Greens in Labor safe seat And another contest could be instructive for those interested (or threatened) by the Greens\u2019 progress in Brisbane. The charity worker Ansary Muhammed is running in Labor\u2019s safest seat, Woodridge, where the Greens polled 7% last time. Muhammed has run a massive campaign and has been endorsed by a host of local figures, including a professional boxer, who would, to put it mildly, not fit the stereotype of your typical Greens voter. At the start of the campaign, the Greens were very confident of winning at least two new seats \u2013 Cooper and McConnel \u2013 and running close in Greenslopes and Miller. Things have changed due to the trajectory of the campaign, especially Labor\u2019s focus on abortion, and the signal it sends to the sorts of voters who might have changed allegiance to the Greens. Labor is even briefing that one of the Greens\u2019 existing seats, South Brisbane, is at risk if the LNP drops to third, due to the flow of preferences. While that is unlikely, the state of play is that the Greens might win one seat, or they might win six. The Greens are still confident, but decidedly less confident than three weeks ago. If today is anything to go by, Labor thinks it can hold these seats, or at least it will be close. Steven Miles visited Cooper, Greenslopes, Miller and McConnel today. And Labor volunteers were at those polling booths in big numbers. For context, the Greens have smashed Labor in terms of door knocking and field campaigning in the inner city. Today at some of these booths red shirts outnumbered green ones by 2:1. Earlier today, the Electoral Commission of Queensland confirmed that just under 2 million Queenslanders had voted in pre-poll. The ECQ also said that one report, stating printer issues had impeded voting, was not correct: Election staff are continuing to work tirelessly to take votes across Queensland including addressing minor issues as they arise in any of the over 1,000 polling booths currently open across the state. As we mentioned earlier, voters have until 6pm tonight to cast their votes. Postal votes should be returned as soon as possible, and by 5 November, to be included in the count, the commission said. People who requested a postal vote can choose to vote in person today, and should \u201cdispose of their postal ballot papers safely\u201d. Counting will begin at 6pm tonight. The counts on election night are \u201cthe unofficial preliminary count and the indicative count\u201d, and the official count begins tomorrow morning, the commission said. More than 3.68 million Queenslanders are enrolled to vote in the election. Contests throughout the south-east for LNP and Labor In the south-east there are also a lot of contests. Aspley and Mansfield are usually bellwethers, but tonight they\u2019ll be a test of whether the LNP can break back through in Brisbane\u2019s middle suburbs, where they\u2019ve polled poorly for a long time. Labor is also looking unsure about holding Pine Rivers, Springwood, Redlands, Capalaba, Mount Ommaney. The party has put an almighty effort into defending Gaven, on the northern Gold Coast, and the popular housing minister, Meaghan Scanlon, who is tipped as a future leader. That contest should be close. Ipswich will also be interesting. Labor lost Ipswich West at a byelection with a 17% swing. If that holds, the neighbouring seat of Ipswich could also fall. If not, regaining Ipswich West could be a lone bright spot for Labor. Action set for seats along the coastline Seats along the coastline \u2013 from just north of Brisbane to the tip of Cape York \u2013 is where a lot of the action is going to be. Labor seats at risk include Pumicestone (Bribie Island), Redcliffe, Caloundra, Nicklin (Sunshine Coast), Hervey Bay, Bundaberg, Keppel, Rockhampton, Mackay, Mundingburra, Thuringowa, Townsville, Mulgrave, Cairns, Barron River and Cook. There are only two in that stretch of coastline \u2013 Gladstone and Maryborough \u2013 where Labor is comfortable. If either of those look shaky, we\u2019re in landslide territory. One of the things that\u2019s usually fascinating about Queensland elections is that voters are not one big homogeneous group. And so before tonight begins, a word of caution about \u201cthe swing\u201d \u2013 it often goes in different directions in different parts of the state. But that also doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t get a good read on the election from early results. The easy bit first \u2013 no one in their right mind expects any sort of upset in Queensland\u2019s west, or its agricultural areas. Everything west of the Great Dividing Range is staying put. Those seats are mostly held by the LNP, other than Traeger, which is Robbie Katter\u2019s seat. What\u2019s at stake this election Before we take a look at the state of play across the state, you can read Ben Smee\u2019s explainer or watch below for a refresher on what\u2019s at stake: Good afternoon, and welcome to Guardian Australia\u2019s coverage of the 2024 Queensland state election. My name is Emily Wind, and I\u2019ll be taking you through all the action as polls close at 6pm and counting continues through the night. The Labor party is vying for a fourth term in government, after the former premier Annastacia Palaszczuk ousted the LNP\u2019s Campbell Newman back in 2015. Palaszczuk announced her retirement from politics last December, with her deputy, Steven Miles, stepping up to become premier. He has had just 10 months to prove he deserves a four-year term in his own right, and will today go head-to-head with the LNP leader, David Crisafulli \u2013 who is hoping to nab power back from Labor after nearly a decade. Labor has governed Queensland for 30 of the last 35 years. Katter\u2019s Australian party, the Greens and One Nation are running multiple candidates, with several independents and minor parties also throwing their hat in the ring for the 93-electorate parliament. In the lead up to today, the polls all pointed to a major LNP win \u2013 with the party needing 12 seats to form majority government. Yesterday, polls suggested Crisafulli was losing support but could still achieve a narrow victory. Depending on how close the race is, we could have a winner within hours. However, with nearly 2 million people voting in pre-poll, this could delay results. We have the whole Queensland team on deck to bring us updates throughout the night \u2013 including Ben Smee, Andrew Messenger and Joe Hinchliffe. With that, let\u2019s get started.",

Ministers last week announced an independent commission into the water sector and regulation, in what is expected to be the largest review of the industry since privatisation.

From 2021 to 2023, there were about 120,000 samples taken at sewage plants in England, with about 5,000 recorded as no-flows. Wasp has compiled 18 examples at 14 plants involving seven water firms from 2021 to 2023 where no-flows were reported on the day that a sampler arrived. In some cases, previous tests had already shown the plants were at risk of breaching or had breached the environmental conditions of their permits. Wasp says the agency should properly investigate the reasons in each case and it is unacceptable that the plant was deemed to be compliant when no samples were taken.

These include a blockage, a power cut, planned maintenance, tankering of sewage to other plants and intermittent flow. They say there are strict safeguards to prevent manipulation of operator self-monitoring or abuse of the system.

The current approach has tightly-controlled requirements that include detailed obligations about the timing and frequency of samples, and how they should be taken.\u201d The Environment Agency said the rules were being updated from 1 January, which would require water firms to reschedule a sample in the event of no flow of effluent from the plant. Water firms will be required to document when and why no-flows have occurred and make this available for subsequent audit by the agency. The agency said that. on average, about 5% of samples a year are no-flows and this compares with no-flow rates when the agency took the samples. Officials say a water company may legitimately choose to tanker flows away from a plant rather than allow poor quality effluent to be discharged. An Environment Agency spokesperson said: \u201cWe investigates no-flow samples where there is a risk to the environment or if we suspect that an offence has occurred.\u201d It is already carrying out its largest ever criminal investigation into potential widespread non-compliance by water companies.

Middle Eastern countries universally called for de-escalation, while criticising the Israeli operation, codenamed \u201cDays of Repentance\u201d, for violating Iran\u2019s sovereignty. Saudi Arabia, the Sunni Muslim world\u2019s geopolitical linchpin, said it condemned the Israeli attack as a \u201cviolation of international laws and norms\u201d. Relations between Riyadh and Tehran, which vie for dominance in the region, have improved in the past year. In a deal brokered by China in 2023, the countries have re-established diplomatic relations. The Gulf states Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, which like Saudi Arabia could be drawn into a regional escalation, also denounced the Israeli airstrikes. \u201cThe UAE strongly condemns the military targeting of the Islamic Republic of Iran and expresses deep concern over the continued escalation and its impact on regional security and stability,\u201d the UAE foreign ministry said. The attack was a \u201cblatant violation of Iran\u2019s sovereignty and a clear breach of international law\u201d, the Qatari foreign ministry said, adding that the international community must step up diplomatic efforts aimed at \u201cending the suffering of the peoples of the region, particularly in Gaza and Lebanon\u201d. Egypt, which along with Qatar has mediated indirect ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas over the past year, said it \u201ccondemns all actions that threaten the stability of the region\u201d. A deal is the \u201conly way to de-escalate\u201d, a statement from the ministry of foreign affairs said. The Iraqi prime minister\u2019s office said Israel \u201ccontinues its aggressive policies and expansion of conflict in the region, employing blatant acts of aggression without deterrence\u201d. The neighbouring country, which briefly closed its airspace after the Israeli attack, also reiterated calls for ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that Israel is fighting in Gaza, said on the messaging app Telegram: \u201cWe consider this a flagrant violation of Iranian sovereignty and an escalation that threatens the security of the region and the safety of its people, placing full responsibility on the occupation [Israel] for the consequences of this aggression, supported by the United States of America.\u201d There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia also allied with Iran, against which Israel launched a ground invasion earlier this month. Syria, a staunch Iranian ally, which was also targeted by reported Israeli airstrikes overnight, expressed \u201csolidarity\u201d with Tehran. A statement from the foreign ministry said Damascus supported \u201cIran\u2019s legitimate right to defend itself and protect its territory and the lives of its citizens\u201d. Jordan, Pakistan, Turkey and Malaysia also joined the chorus of condemnation of Israel on Saturday morning. The Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said Moscow was worried about an \u201cexplosive escalation\u201d in hostilities between Iran and Israel that could spiral out of control.",

Astrology in the middle ages was a much more scientifically minded pursuit. People gave it a lot of credence as a principle for understanding the passage of time, and the influence of the sun and moon and other planets on the body. It had much more to do with daily life: diet, medicine, activities you should be undertaking at a particular moment of the year.</p> <p><strong>How many people across </strong><strong>medieval Europe would have known their sign?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s a fascinating question, and it\u2019s difficult to answer. The zodiac and astrology was definitely part of intellectual discourse. It was part of university learning. It was part of medical practice. It\u2019s fair to say most people who are being treated for medical ailments of any kind would have come into contact with some sort of astrological ideas, whether that has to do with the balance of humors in their body [fluids like blood and phlegm, which were thought to influence personality], or the right time to bloodlet, for example. Whether that meant every peasant in the countryside of medieval France [knew their sign] \u2013 probably not.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re saying astrology was used as part of medical treatment? Would people who were sick and trying to get treatment be asked about their astrological sign?</strong></p> <p>Within medicine, you have a huge variation in practices. You might have someone like a barber surgeon, who is performing more elaborate, slightly more invasive surgeries and doing more bloodletting, and you might have someone who is a folk medicine practitioner who is prescribing herbal remedies or doing some light bloodletting. In both of those cases, there would be some consultation with astrological ideas, whether that meant a more in-depth analysis of someone\u2019s sun sign and the time of year or their humors and their ailment \u2013 or it could be much more surface level: is this a good season to take medicine generally? It was believed that different signs ruled different parts of the body.</p>    <p><strong>This exhibit explains to visitors that, according to medieval astrology, your astrological sign might be different from the one you have today. Why is that?</strong></p> <p>In the middle ages, the system was much simpler: each month was associated with a sign. With increased precision in astronomical observation, we have much greater information today about the position of certain constellations at certain times of year, which informs a greater specificity in the dates assigned to corresponding zodiac signs.</p> <p>The idea that you could have a different sign in the middle ages \u2013 it shakes people\u2019s identity in a way that I think is quite fascinating. Our astrological sign is part of our personality in a way that makes us legible to other people. I\u2019m a September Virgo. In the medieval system, I\u2019m a Libra, and I don\u2019t identify as a Libra at all. People who have the same sign in the middle ages and today, they\u2019re reassured that sign is really who they are, and they have a sense of superiority about it.</p> <p><strong>Was there as much s</strong><strong>kepticism about astrology in the middle ages as there is today?</strong></p> <p>It was pretty common practice for noble and royal courts to employ an astrologer, who consults with kings and rulers on macro-level decisions, military decisions. There were always whispering about counselors who are too influential, or which ruler put too much stock in what his astrologer says. That\u2019s where the skepticism started to come in. They were skeptical of the idea of using astrological interpretation for future-telling, or aspects of divination, because it presumes something about humans being able to figure out God\u2019s plan in a way that is maybe overstepping boundaries.</p> <p>People who dismiss astrology today dismiss the whole idea. Medieval opinion was a little more nuanced.</p> <p><strong>We think today of astrology being separate from Christianity \u2013 maybe even a spiritual competitor, or an alternative to religious practice. Was that the case in the middle ages?</strong></p> <p>The zodiac signs often appeared in devotional or religious books, and the interpretation of the movement of celestial bodies was really consistent with a Christian worldview. It was believed that God not only divinely created everything, he individually placed the stars where they were ordained to go. The interpretation of those divinely created objects was consistent with what God wants humans to do.</p> <p><strong>You recently hosted a conversation with online astrologers</strong><strong>. One of the </strong><strong>panelists, Kyle Thomas, said </strong><strong>there have been big changes in the culture of astrology in just the past few years, and that </strong><strong>gen Z and other young people have a much more rigid and literal approach to astrological guidance than previous generations.

It makes me wonder if, in 600 years, people will think of 2024 as a particularly astrological time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/11/how-astrology-paved-way-predictive-analytics\">How astrology paved the way for predictive analytics</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>What\u2019s one of the biggest similarities you found between astrology centuries ago and now?</strong></p> <p>Towards the end of the 15th and 16th centuries, some of these astrological treatises went into print. The information became much more widely disseminated, and there was an increased knowledge about different temperaments based on the humors and astrological signs. There was a cultural parallel between that, and people today having a greater access to the details of astrology via social media and apps. I think it\u2019s fueling an increased interest in astrology, in the same way that print did in the fifteenth century.</p> <p><strong>You mentioned that medieval astrological illustrations are very popular with people on social media today</strong><strong>; these very old images are still relatable, even sharable, content. Do you think people from the middle ages would also be able to relate to today\u2019s online astrology content?</strong></p> <p>I believe the average medieval person would love Instagram, because it really is an inherently visual experience. They would be able to recognize some of the astrological content that we have today, especially representations of the Zodiac symbols. I think they would get a little lost in the idea of personality, like, \u2018Because you\u2019re a Virgo, you\u2019re this.\u2019</p> <p><strong>What advice does medieval astrology offer for us this </strong><strong>October and November?</strong></p> <p>October is a good time for battling and fighting, that\u2019s a very Scorpio thing. Also a good time for taking medicine generally. November is Sagittarius. It\u2019s a particularly good time for gathering acorns<strong>,</strong> harvesting and getting married, as well as reconciling with enemies and bloodletting from the arms.</p> <p>People always ask if it\u2019s a good season for bloodletting. That\u2019s all people want to know.</p>",

It makes me wonder if, in 600 years, people will think of 2024 as a particularly astrological time. What\u2019s one of the biggest similarities you found between astrology centuries ago and now? Towards the end of the 15th and 16th centuries, some of these astrological treatises went into print. The information became much more widely disseminated, and there was an increased knowledge about different temperaments based on the humors and astrological signs. There was a cultural parallel between that, and people today having a greater access to the details of astrology via social media and apps. I think it\u2019s fueling an increased interest in astrology, in the same way that print did in the fifteenth century. You mentioned that medieval astrological illustrations are very popular with people on social media today; these very old images are still relatable, even sharable, content. Do you think people from the middle ages would also be able to relate to today\u2019s online astrology content? I believe the average medieval person would love Instagram, because it really is an inherently visual experience. They would be able to recognize some of the astrological content that we have today, especially representations of the Zodiac symbols. I think they would get a little lost in the idea of personality, like, \u2018Because you\u2019re a Virgo, you\u2019re this.\u2019 What advice does medieval astrology offer for us this October and November? October is a good time for battling and fighting, that\u2019s a very Scorpio thing. Also a good time for taking medicine generally. November is Sagittarius. It\u2019s a particularly good time for gathering acorns, harvesting and getting married, as well as reconciling with enemies and bloodletting from the arms. People always ask if it\u2019s a good season for bloodletting. That\u2019s all people want to know.",

But the crisis has left a deep, melancholy dread about the future.</p> <p>\u201cCubans have a cheerful idiosyncrasy,\u201d said Julio C\u00e9sar Rodr\u00edguez, 52. \u201cEven when things are bad we laugh. But this is really bad.\u201d</p> <p>This current crisis began on 17 October, when an order went out for all non-essential state workers to go home.</p> <p>The effort to save power didn\u2019t save the system, and a day later, the island went dark. Antonio Guiteras, one of the main power stations, shut down, crashing all the other big generating stations in the system.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to restart a power station,\u201d said a retired engineer from Antonio Guiteras, who asked to remain anonymous. \u201cYou need to produce a lot of electricity just to get it going.\u201d</p> <p>Antonio Guiteras was built in 1989, and is now battered and obsolete. \u201cThe truth is that it was built rotten,\u201d said the engineer. He told harrowing stories of working with faulty safety equipment, political management who would disappear when problems arose and a system long pushed to its limit.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a scheduled maintenance programme, but it was never followed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe requirements were too tight. We were told: \u2018The factory has to produce, so patch it up.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The government acknowledges the parlous state of its system, blaming the 62-year old-trade embargo imposed by the United States. President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel said \u201cfinancial and energy persecution\u201d made it difficult to \u201cimport fuel and other resources necessary\u201d.</p>    <p>For most of its existence, Cuba\u2019s government has relied on the largesse of allies \u2013 first Russia and then Venezuela. But those countries, facing their own difficulties, have cut supplies heavily. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to keep a sinking ship afloat with corks,\u201d said one European diplomat.</p> <p>In a televised address, Cuba\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Marrero, said the emerging private sector would have to pay more for its power, while the government looks to renewables to secure its future energy needs.</p> <p>The island is blessed by sunshine, but the multiple attempts to start solar projects have nearly all failed when the companies involved failed to get paid. \u201cThe government isn\u2019t stupid,\u201d said a foreign businessman. \u201cBut there is no money.\u201d</p> <p>Instead a deal has been cut with a Chinese firm to provide the materials for a slew of solar farms in return for access to Cuba\u2019s nickel deposits. But with well over 10% of Cuba\u2019s population <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/06/cuba-health-education-workers-leaving\">having fled the economic crisis</a> on the island in the last two years, there is scepticism whether the expertise remains to build such systems.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> has said that while he\u2019s \u201ctough\u201d on the Cuban government, he supports the Cuban people. But Washington could do much more help Cuba, argued the US academic William LeoGrande in the latest issue of Foreign Policy magazine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/20/scarce-food-and-stifling-homes-sputtering-grid-pushes-cuba-nearer-collapse\">Scarce food and stifling homes: sputtering grid pushes Cuba nearer collapse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe proponents of regime change should be careful what they wish for,\u201d he <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/10/22/cuba-united-states-electrical-grid-outage-humanitarian-crisis-migration/\">wrote</a>. \u201cA collapse of the regime would be a humanitarian disaster, spurring an emigration tsunami far larger than what we have seen so far. A breakdown of social order could unleash a surge of criminal violence.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/18/cuba-protests-food-electricity-shortage\">during previous power cuts</a>, there has been very little protest this time, beyond the bashing of some pots and pans. People seem exhausted and government ministers have made it clear that the government will come down hard on any \u201cindecent\u201d behaviour.</p> <p>Recent months have seen a new round of intimidation of journalists, with several forced to flee the country. On Wednesday, Amnesty International declared four people currently in Cuban jails \u2013 the journalist F\u00e9lix Navarro and his daughter, Sayli Navarro, as well as protesters Roberto P\u00e9rez Fonseca and Luis Robles \u2013 as \u201cprisoners of conscience\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, one crisis begets another. Failures have been reported in the equally obsolete water supply system. Six hundred thousand people lack regular running water, but the blackouts appear to have multiplied that number by damaging pumps and pipes. Much of Havana is dry.</p> <p>Dariel Ram\u00edrez was sitting on his stoop in the old town. He didn\u2019t have much to eat because he had shared his stored food with others before it spoiled.</p> <p>Asked how he was preparing for any repeat of the power crisis, he pointed towards the Museum of the Revolution, where the central symbol of communist rule is displayed: the boat on which Fidel and Ra\u00fal Castro arrived from Mexico in 1956.</p> <p>\u201cIf this happens again, we need to prepare the Granma yacht,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we can all sail away.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Eileen Sosin</em></p>",

She lives in the shelter because her home collapsed, a regular occurrence in the poorest, oldest parts of the beautiful city. Cuba\u2019s government has spent the last days attempting to get the island\u2019s national grid functioning after repeated island-wide blackouts. Without power, sleep becomes difficult in the heat, food spoils and the water supply fails. Parts of Cuba\u2019s communist system still function: the municipality sent Maria food. \u201cWe are three families here,\u201d she said. \u201cI live alone, the lady who lives next to me [does] also, and there are two children, the children\u2019s mother, her aunt and an elderly man.\u201d A week after the blackout, the island has returned to the status quo ante with regular power cuts of up to 20 hours a day. But the crisis has left a deep, melancholy dread about the future. \u201cCubans have a cheerful idiosyncrasy,\u201d said Julio C\u00e9sar Rodr\u00edguez, 52. \u201cEven when things are bad we laugh. But this is really bad.\u201d This current crisis began on 17 October, when an order went out for all non-essential state workers to go home. The effort to save power didn\u2019t save the system, and a day later, the island went dark. Antonio Guiteras, one of the main power stations, shut down, crashing all the other big generating stations in the system. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to restart a power station,\u201d said a retired engineer from Antonio Guiteras, who asked to remain anonymous. \u201cYou need to produce a lot of electricity just to get it going.\u201d Antonio Guiteras was built in 1989, and is now battered and obsolete. \u201cThe truth is that it was built rotten,\u201d said the engineer. He told harrowing stories of working with faulty safety equipment, political management who would disappear when problems arose and a system long pushed to its limit. \u201cThere was a scheduled maintenance programme, but it was never followed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe requirements were too tight. We were told: \u2018The factory has to produce, so patch it up.\u2019\u201d The government acknowledges the parlous state of its system, blaming the 62-year old-trade embargo imposed by the United States. President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel said \u201cfinancial and energy persecution\u201d made it difficult to \u201cimport fuel and other resources necessary\u201d. For most of its existence, Cuba\u2019s government has relied on the largesse of allies \u2013 first Russia and then Venezuela. But those countries, facing their own difficulties, have cut supplies heavily. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to keep a sinking ship afloat with corks,\u201d said one European diplomat. In a televised address, Cuba\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Marrero, said the emerging private sector would have to pay more for its power, while the government looks to renewables to secure its future energy needs. The island is blessed by sunshine, but the multiple attempts to start solar projects have nearly all failed when the companies involved failed to get paid. \u201cThe government isn\u2019t stupid,\u201d said a foreign businessman. \u201cBut there is no money.\u201d Instead a deal has been cut with a Chinese firm to provide the materials for a slew of solar farms in return for access to Cuba\u2019s nickel deposits. But with well over 10% of Cuba\u2019s population having fled the economic crisis on the island in the last two years, there is scepticism whether the expertise remains to build such systems. Joe Biden has said that while he\u2019s \u201ctough\u201d on the Cuban government, he supports the Cuban people. But Washington could do much more help Cuba, argued the US academic William LeoGrande in the latest issue of Foreign Policy magazine. \u201cThe proponents of regime change should be careful what they wish for,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA collapse of the regime would be a humanitarian disaster, spurring an emigration tsunami far larger than what we have seen so far. A breakdown of social order could unleash a surge of criminal violence.\u201d Unlike during previous power cuts, there has been very little protest this time, beyond the bashing of some pots and pans. People seem exhausted and government ministers have made it clear that the government will come down hard on any \u201cindecent\u201d behaviour. Recent months have seen a new round of intimidation of journalists, with several forced to flee the country. On Wednesday, Amnesty International declared four people currently in Cuban jails \u2013 the journalist F\u00e9lix Navarro and his daughter, Sayli Navarro, as well as protesters Roberto P\u00e9rez Fonseca and Luis Robles \u2013 as \u201cprisoners of conscience\u201d. Meanwhile, one crisis begets another. Failures have been reported in the equally obsolete water supply system. Six hundred thousand people lack regular running water, but the blackouts appear to have multiplied that number by damaging pumps and pipes. Much of Havana is dry. Dariel Ram\u00edrez was sitting on his stoop in the old town. He didn\u2019t have much to eat because he had shared his stored food with others before it spoiled. Asked how he was preparing for any repeat of the power crisis, he pointed towards the Museum of the Revolution, where the central symbol of communist rule is displayed: the boat on which Fidel and Ra\u00fal Castro arrived from Mexico in 1956. \u201cIf this happens again, we need to prepare the Granma yacht,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we can all sail away.\u201d Additional reporting by Eileen Sosin",

She has not sought to be an icon or be put on a pedestal \u2013 but she will be a model for others. \u201cIn court last week I represented a victim who was raped as a nine-year-old, and she wanted the hearing held in public. She said that because Gis\u00e8le Pelicot had the courage to do it, so would she.\u201d",

And, at an earlier stop, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/24/trump-arizona-rally-immigration\">repeated his assertion</a> that migration had turned the US into a \u201cgarbage can for the world\u201d. Before sitting for her own podcast interview with vulnerability researcher Bren\u00e9 Brown, Harris responded to Trump\u2019s remark, calling it \u201canother example of how he really belittles our country\u201d.</p> \n<p>Harris does not expect to win Texas. But Democrats here are suddenly hopeful after polls suggest an unexpectedly close senate race between the Republican incumbent, Ted Cruz, and the Democrat, Dallas-area congressman Colin Allred.</p> \n<p>Senate Democrats face a daunting map this cycle. With a loss in West Virginia all but certain, and Montana slipping away, their hopes of maintaining narrow-control of the chamber increasingly rest on an upset in the Lone Star state.</p> \n<p>In his remarks, Allred taunted his opponent for supporting Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, which led to the January 6 assault on the US Capitol, and for fleeing to Canc\u00fan, Mexico, during a winter storm that devastated the state.</p> \n<p>\u201cEverything is bigger in Texas. But Ted Cruz is too small for Texas,\u201d Allred said, holding his hand low for emphasis.</p> \n<p>The emotional heart of the evening was the personal stories of Texas women who had nearly died from pregnancy-related complications because they did not receive proper care.</p> \n<p>Ondrea Cummings, a Texas woman who appeared in a new Harris campaign, became emotional as she shared her harrowing experience after a miscarriage at 16 weeks and needing an emergency abortion that she was denied under the state\u2019s law. A video played before her remarks showed her with a wound and scars that stretched down her body, from her breast to her pelvis, after a six-hour surgery in which she said doctors had to cut open her torso in order to save her life.</p> \n<p>\u201cTexas\u2019 abortion bans unleashed by Donald Trump almost cost me my life and have left me with physical and emotional scars,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Amanda and Josh Zurawski, residents of Austin, Texas, also shared their story. At 18 weeks pregnant with a girl she planned to name Willow, Amanda Zurawski began to suffer complications and needed an abortion. There was no chance the fetus would survive, but doctors refused to terminate the pregnancy until she eventually developed sepsis, days later.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was finally close enough to death to deserve healthcare in Texas,\u201d said Amanda Zurawski, who has been a powerful surrogate for Harris on the campaign trail.</p> \n<p>Todd Ivey, an OB-GYN in Houston, addressed the crowd surrounded by a team of doctors and medical professionals in white coats. He emphasized the challenges of administering care to patients under a law that threatens physicians with jail time for performing abortions. Since the Texas\u2019s abortion law took effect the state\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/24/texas-abortion-ban-infant-deaths\">infant mortality has risen</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese laws are designed to handcuff me \u2013 literally,\u201d he said, declaring: \u201cThere is no place for Donald Trump in my exam room.\u201d</p> \n<p>Among those in the crowd was Sara Gonzales, of Splendora, Texas, who rescheduled her work schedule so that she could drive straight to the stadium after finishing an early-morning shift at Starbucks. The 32-year-old said she considers herself an independent and in 2020, wrote in a candidate for president. But the political stakes changed, Gonzales said, the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, and Texas enacted its near-total ban on abortion. She plans to vote for Harris in the 5 November election.</p> \n<p>\u201cBeing a woman in Texas right now, it\u2019s not OK,\u201d she said. \u201cI should have freedom over my own body.\u201d</p>",

On Friday night, Willie Nelson, the country music star who was introduced as a \u201cTexas voter\u201d, performed a handful of his best-known songs, including On the Road Again and actor Jessica Alba urged women to vote. Beyonc\u00e9 was joined by her mother, Tina Knowles, and her former bandmate Kelly Rowland, who gave a rousing call to action on Harris\u2019s behalf. \u201cWe are grabbing back the pen from those who are trying to write an American story that would deny the right for women to make our own decisions about our bodies,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cToday that means grabbing that pen and casting my vote for Kamala Harris.\u201d The night before, Harris held her first campaign event with Barack Obama. They were joined onstage in Atlanta by rocker Bruce Springsteen, who played a three-song set and branded Trump an \u201cAmerican tyrant.\u201d On Saturday, Harris will rally with Michelle Obama in Michigan. Trump was also in Texas on Friday, where he taped a lengthy podcast interview with Joe Rogan. And, at an earlier stop, he repeated his assertion that migration had turned the US into a \u201cgarbage can for the world\u201d. Before sitting for her own podcast interview with vulnerability researcher Bren\u00e9 Brown, Harris responded to Trump\u2019s remark, calling it \u201canother example of how he really belittles our country\u201d. Harris does not expect to win Texas. But Democrats here are suddenly hopeful after polls suggest an unexpectedly close senate race between the Republican incumbent, Ted Cruz, and the Democrat, Dallas-area congressman Colin Allred. Senate Democrats face a daunting map this cycle. With a loss in West Virginia all but certain, and Montana slipping away, their hopes of maintaining narrow-control of the chamber increasingly rest on an upset in the Lone Star state. In his remarks, Allred taunted his opponent for supporting Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, which led to the January 6 assault on the US Capitol, and for fleeing to Canc\u00fan, Mexico, during a winter storm that devastated the state. \u201cEverything is bigger in Texas. But Ted Cruz is too small for Texas,\u201d Allred said, holding his hand low for emphasis. The emotional heart of the evening was the personal stories of Texas women who had nearly died from pregnancy-related complications because they did not receive proper care. Ondrea Cummings, a Texas woman who appeared in a new Harris campaign, became emotional as she shared her harrowing experience after a miscarriage at 16 weeks and needing an emergency abortion that she was denied under the state\u2019s law. A video played before her remarks showed her with a wound and scars that stretched down her body, from her breast to her pelvis, after a six-hour surgery in which she said doctors had to cut open her torso in order to save her life. \u201cTexas\u2019 abortion bans unleashed by Donald Trump almost cost me my life and have left me with physical and emotional scars,\u201d she said. Amanda and Josh Zurawski, residents of Austin, Texas, also shared their story. At 18 weeks pregnant with a girl she planned to name Willow, Amanda Zurawski began to suffer complications and needed an abortion. There was no chance the fetus would survive, but doctors refused to terminate the pregnancy until she eventually developed sepsis, days later. \u201cI was finally close enough to death to deserve healthcare in Texas,\u201d said Amanda Zurawski, who has been a powerful surrogate for Harris on the campaign trail. Todd Ivey, an OB-GYN in Houston, addressed the crowd surrounded by a team of doctors and medical professionals in white coats. He emphasized the challenges of administering care to patients under a law that threatens physicians with jail time for performing abortions. Since the Texas\u2019s abortion law took effect the state\u2019s infant mortality has risen. \u201cThese laws are designed to handcuff me \u2013 literally,\u201d he said, declaring: \u201cThere is no place for Donald Trump in my exam room.\u201d Among those in the crowd was Sara Gonzales, of Splendora, Texas, who rescheduled her work schedule so that she could drive straight to the stadium after finishing an early-morning shift at Starbucks. The 32-year-old said she considers herself an independent and in 2020, wrote in a candidate for president. But the political stakes changed, Gonzales said, the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, and Texas enacted its near-total ban on abortion. She plans to vote for Harris in the 5 November election. \u201cBeing a woman in Texas right now, it\u2019s not OK,\u201d she said. \u201cI should have freedom over my own body.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Georgians have headed to the polls in a pivotal parliamentary election that could determine whether Georgia shifts away from its long-held western orientations towards stronger ties with the Kremlin. Voters will decide on Saturday whether the Georgian Dream (GD) party, which has been in power since 2012 and steered the country into a conservative course away from the west and closer to Russia, secures another four-year term. GD was founded by the shadowy billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s and is viewed by many friends and foes alike as Georgia\u2019s most powerful figure, even though he has not held public office for more than a decade. Casting his vote on Saturday morning, Ivanishvili, whose wealth is estimated to be $7.5bn (\u00a35.8bn) in a country whose GDP is $30bn, said the election was a choice between electing a government for \u201cthe Georgian people\u201d and an \u201cagent of a foreign country\u201d. GD has run its campaign on accusations that the pro-western opposition was trying to pull Georgia into a Ukraine-style conflict. In 2008, Georgia \u2013 a country of 3.6 million people nestled in the Caucasus mountains \u2013 fought a war with Russia that lasted five days but left deep scars, and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has left some in the country wary of the possible consequences of provoking Russia by moving closer to the west. The party has also been accused by critics of plans to move the country into an authoritarian direction after Ivanishvili vowed to ban all major opposition parties and remove opposition lawmakers if his party was re-elected. \u201cThe government is openly pledging to transform Georgia into a one-party state \u2013 a move unprecedented in modern Georgian history,\u201d said Tina Khidasheli, the chair of the non-governmental organisation Civic Idea and a former defence minister. Outside polling stations in central Tbilisi, some voters echoed this sentiment. \u201cThis is the most important day in our modern history, the situation is very dangerous,\u201d said Mariam Khvedelidze, a 23-year-old student who voted for Save Georgia, an opposition bloc centred around the party of Mikheil Saakashvili, the former president who is in prison on charges of abuse of power that his allies say are politically motivated. Support for the pro-western opposition groups generally comes from urban and younger voters, who envision their political future with the EU. \u201cOur democracy and future in Europe is at stake. We can not become puppets of the Kremlin,\u201d Khvedelidze added. But other Georgians said they had voted for the ruling party, believing it was the only force that could keep the country out of war with Russia. \u201cRight now, we need stability and friendly relations with Moscow,\u201d said Elene Kiknadze, a 74-year-old woman. Voting for GD, Kiknadze said, would also ensure Georgia would keep its \u201ctraditions\u201d, referring to its conservative values, including opposition to rights for LGBTQ+ people. \u201cLet Europe have their freedoms. We don\u2019t need gay parades in this country,\u201d she added. The ruling Georgian government, aligned with the deeply conservative and influential Orthodox church, has sought to galvanise anti-liberal sentiments by campaigning on \u201cfamily values\u201d and criticising what it portrays as western excesses. In the summer, the parliament passed legislation imposing sweeping restrictions on LGBTQ+ rights, a move critics say mirrors laws enacted in neighbouring Russia, where authorities have implemented a series of repressive measures against sexual minorities. Georgia\u2019s notoriously divided opposition has attempted to unite by forming four pro-European blocs, which have all endorsed the Georgian charter, an initiative proposed by the pro-western president, Salome Zourabichvili, urging them to prevent GD from forming a coalition and remaining in power. The four blocs have vowed to form a coalition government to oust GD from power and put Georgia back on track to join the EU. \u201cI am confident that Georgians will choose for the European future,\u201d Tinatin Bokuchava, the leader of the biggest opposition party, United National Movement (UNM), said on Friday. The EU granted Georgia candidate membership status last year but has put its application on hold in response to a controversial \u201cforeign agents\u201d bill that was passed in May requiring media and NGOs receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as \u201cagents of foreign influence\u201d. The bill, which triggered weeks of mass protests in the spring of this year, has been labelled a \u201cRussian law\u201d by critics, who liken it to legislation introduced by the Kremlin a decade earlier to silence political dissent in the media and elsewhere. Independent NGOs have warned that GD will attempt to undermine the parliamentary elections, relying on their \u201cadministrative resources\u201d \u2013 an umbrella term that includes pressing state employees to vote and offering cash handouts to mostly rural voters. On Saturday morning, several videos circulated online appearing to show ballot stuffing and voter intimidation at various polling stations across Georgia. \u201cWe are reporting dozens, if not hundreds of electoral violations taking place across the country,\u201d UNM wrote on X. Predicting the elections is hard, given the absence of reliable polling. Surveys sponsored by the ruling party predict a landslide victory for GD, while media sympathetic to the opposing sides have published rival polls, with pro-opposition broadcasters forecasting the ruling party will lose its majority. Observers generally agree that GD will become the biggest party but might come short of claiming a majority, and struggle to form a government, with all other blocs refusing to collaborate with it. The opposition has warned that the ruling party may attempt to manipulate the results, which could trigger mass protests, potentially followed by a harsh police crackdown. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t expect Georgians to tolerate electoral fraud. People won\u2019t stand by as their future is taken from them,\u201d said opposition leader Bokuchava.",

      "body": "<p>When two American billionaires blocked the newspapers they own from endorsing Kamala Harris this month, they tried to frame the decision as an act of civic responsibility.</p> <p>\u201cI think my fear is, if we chose either one, that it would just add to the division,\u201d Patrick Soon-Shiong, the biotech billionaire who owns the Los Angeles Times, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/25/los-angeles-times-owner-blocks-harris-endorsement\">said</a>. He emphasised that though some might assume his family is \u201cultra-progressive\u201d, he is a registered \u201cindependent\u201d.</p> <p>At the Washington Post, which reported that its billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, was behind the decision, publisher William Lewis described the retreat from making presidential endorsements as \u201ca statement in support of our readers\u2019 ability to make up their own minds\u201d.</p> <p>Veteran journalists and media critics are using a very different phrase to describe Soon-Shiong\u2019s and Bezos\u2019s choice: they\u2019re saying the two billionaires, among the richest men on the entire globe, are performing \u201c<a href=\"https://x.com/brianstelter/status/1849972714020208717\">anticipatory</a> <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/political_press/the-washington-post-opinion-editor-approved-a-harris-endorsement-a-week-later-the-papers-publisher-killed-it.php\">obedience</a>\u201d to Donald Trump.</p> <p>Yes, \u201c<a href=\"https://x.com/PostBaron/status/1849847940761657353\">cowardice</a>\u201d has also been a popular way to describe the choice by the billionaire owners of two of the country\u2019s major newspapers to not to risk angering Trump by allowing their papers to endorse his opponent.</p> <p>But \u201canticipatory obedience\u201d is more specific. The term comes from On Tyranny, the bestselling guide to authoritarianism by Timothy Snyder, a historian of eastern and central Europe. The phrase describes, in Snyder\u2019s words, \u201cthe major lesson of the Nazi takeover, and what was supposed to be one of the major lessons of the twentieth century: don\u2019t hand over the power you have before you have to. Don\u2019t protect yourself too early.\u201d It\u2019s a way of describing what Europeans did wrong as totalitarians came to power: by \u201cmentally and physically conceding, you\u2019re already giving over your power to the aspiring authoritarian\u201d, Snyder explains.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/piescarcega/status/1850009987122069941\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Journalists attempting to earn a living and do good work are too often in the unenviable position of working for people who don\u2019t always have the public interest in mind.

If elected, they wrote, Trump would probably mimic Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and use the power of the state to \u201cneutralize the media\u201d through a \u201cbarrage of audits, investigations, and regulatory harassment\u201d. Even before the election, the activists wrote, there were plenty of signs that Trump\u2019s campaign to muzzle the press was already working, including with the selection of Lewis, a controversial veteran of Rupert Murdoch-owned conservative media outlets, as Bezos\u2019s new publisher of the Washington Post.</p>    <p>Media reporters like CNN\u2019s <a href=\"https://x.com/brianstelter/status/1849972714020208717\">Brian Stelter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/political_press/the-washington-post-opinion-editor-approved-a-harris-endorsement-a-week-later-the-papers-publisher-killed-it.php\">Sewell Chan</a>, the editor of the Columbia Journalism Review, turned to the concept of \u201canticipatory obedience\u201d this week as a way of understanding the current motivations of America\u2019s newspaper billionaires.</p> <p>In a phone interview on Friday, Snyder himself, a history professor at Yale University, said that the media reporters were right: \u201cIt is indeed anticipatory obedience.\u201d</p> <p>The arguments by Soon-Shiong, and Bezos\u2019s publisher, that refusing to endorse a presidential candidate would make the newspapers appear more \u201cindependent\u2019 was nonsense, Snyder said.</p> <p>\u201cOligarchs, the very wealthy people, want to tell us that they\u2019re just \u2018staying out of politics\u2019. But of course, when you stay out of politics in a way that harms democracy, what you are really doing is saying, we, the really wealthy people, are going to be fine in the new post-democratic order,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat they are saying is: after democracy dies in darkness, they\u2019ll be the ones who will be moving happily about in the shadows.\u201d</p>    <p>The fact that this \u201canticipatory obedience\u201d to Trump was being demonstrated by newspaper publishers was particularly alarming, Snyder said. When it comes to opposing authoritarianism, \u201cit\u2019s definitely the case that journalists have very often been the people who have held on the longest, and have set the best example. So a signal from wealthy publishers that journalists should not do that is a very negative phenomenon.\u201d</p> <p>Snyder said he also saw the billionaire newspaper owners\u2019 actions not only as a sign of early obedience to Trump, but also as a very clear message to their own employees.</p> <p>\u201cThis pose of neutrality is in fact a signal to the actual investigative journalists that they are not supposed to be doing their jobs,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cIt\u2019s not neutral to say, \u2018We\u2019re going to ignore the evidence of nearly a decade as to what the election of Donald Trump would mean for freedom of speech, the profession of journalism, and the American republic generally.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo profess neutrality in such a moment is to say that the work and value of the honest journalist means nothing.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Media capture\u2019 comes to the US</strong></h2> <p>So far, the response from journalists at the papers owned by Bezos and Soon-Shiong has been resistance, some of it coming at a personal cost. Three members of the Los Angeles Times\u2019 editorials board, including the section\u2019s editor and a recent Pulitzer prize winner, have resigned in protest since the news was made public. At least one editor at the Washington Post has <a href=\"https://x.com/maxwelltani/status/1849873607163289666\">also resigned</a>, according to Semafor.</p> <p>At the Los Angeles Times, the news that the paper\u2019s owner had refused to let the editorial board publish a planned endorsement of Kamala Harris was only made public when the opinion page editor, Mariel Garza, spoke publicly about her resignation and why she thought the decision had undermined the paper\u2019s integrity: \u201c\u201cI am resigning because I want to make it clear that I am not okay with us being silent,\u201d Garza told the Columbia Journalism Review. \u201cIn dangerous times, honest people need to stand up.\u201d</p> <p>Unions representing journalists who work at both the <a href=\"https://x.com/latguild/status/1849266160988307664\">Los Angeles Times</a> and the <a href=\"https://x.com/PostGuild/status/1849868082900250885\">Washington Post</a> have made public statements about their members\u2019 concern over the decisions, while also pleading with readers not to cancel their subscriptions to already economically struggling newspapers over the behaviour of their billionaire owners.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BradfordPearson/status/1849862572998262981\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It&#39;s so disheartening to see people cancelling their LA Times and Washington Post subscriptions due to decisions made by billionaires.

We also expect that our journalists be permitted to thoroughly cover the news of this city \u2013 including when it occurs at this newspaper \u2013 and do their jobs without fear of being blamed for their employer\u2019s decisions,\u201d the journalists wrote.</p> <p>Sheila Coronel, an investigative journalist from the Philippines who is now a professor at the Columbia Journalism School, said the experience of \u201cmedia capture\u201d, in which media outlets are constrained by pressures from the state and corporations or other special interests, is a familiar one for many reporters around the world</p> <p>After the end of the Marcos regime in the Philippines, she said, there was an explosion of new newspapers, many of them established by people who had business or political interests to advance. \u201cI remember one newspaper editor told me: \u2018A newspaper, to them, is like a gun in the holster.

      "bodyText": "When two American billionaires blocked the newspapers they own from endorsing Kamala Harris this month, they tried to frame the decision as an act of civic responsibility. \u201cI think my fear is, if we chose either one, that it would just add to the division,\u201d Patrick Soon-Shiong, the biotech billionaire who owns the Los Angeles Times, said. He emphasised that though some might assume his family is \u201cultra-progressive\u201d, he is a registered \u201cindependent\u201d. At the Washington Post, which reported that its billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, was behind the decision, publisher William Lewis described the retreat from making presidential endorsements as \u201ca statement in support of our readers\u2019 ability to make up their own minds\u201d. Veteran journalists and media critics are using a very different phrase to describe Soon-Shiong\u2019s and Bezos\u2019s choice: they\u2019re saying the two billionaires, among the richest men on the entire globe, are performing \u201canticipatory obedience\u201d to Donald Trump. Yes, \u201ccowardice\u201d has also been a popular way to describe the choice by the billionaire owners of two of the country\u2019s major newspapers to not to risk angering Trump by allowing their papers to endorse his opponent. But \u201canticipatory obedience\u201d is more specific. The term comes from On Tyranny, the bestselling guide to authoritarianism by Timothy Snyder, a historian of eastern and central Europe. The phrase describes, in Snyder\u2019s words, \u201cthe major lesson of the Nazi takeover, and what was supposed to be one of the major lessons of the twentieth century: don\u2019t hand over the power you have before you have to. Don\u2019t protect yourself too early.\u201d It\u2019s a way of describing what Europeans did wrong as totalitarians came to power: by \u201cmentally and physically conceding, you\u2019re already giving over your power to the aspiring authoritarian\u201d, Snyder explains. Activists Ian Bassin and Maxmillian Potter warned earlier this month, in an opinion piece that now looks prescient, that the US media companies were already headed down the road of \u201canticipatory obedience\u201d. If elected, they wrote, Trump would probably mimic Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and use the power of the state to \u201cneutralize the media\u201d through a \u201cbarrage of audits, investigations, and regulatory harassment\u201d. Even before the election, the activists wrote, there were plenty of signs that Trump\u2019s campaign to muzzle the press was already working, including with the selection of Lewis, a controversial veteran of Rupert Murdoch-owned conservative media outlets, as Bezos\u2019s new publisher of the Washington Post. Media reporters like CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter and Sewell Chan, the editor of the Columbia Journalism Review, turned to the concept of \u201canticipatory obedience\u201d this week as a way of understanding the current motivations of America\u2019s newspaper billionaires. In a phone interview on Friday, Snyder himself, a history professor at Yale University, said that the media reporters were right: \u201cIt is indeed anticipatory obedience.\u201d The arguments by Soon-Shiong, and Bezos\u2019s publisher, that refusing to endorse a presidential candidate would make the newspapers appear more \u201cindependent\u2019 was nonsense, Snyder said. \u201cOligarchs, the very wealthy people, want to tell us that they\u2019re just \u2018staying out of politics\u2019. But of course, when you stay out of politics in a way that harms democracy, what you are really doing is saying, we, the really wealthy people, are going to be fine in the new post-democratic order,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they are saying is: after democracy dies in darkness, they\u2019ll be the ones who will be moving happily about in the shadows.\u201d The fact that this \u201canticipatory obedience\u201d to Trump was being demonstrated by newspaper publishers was particularly alarming, Snyder said. When it comes to opposing authoritarianism, \u201cit\u2019s definitely the case that journalists have very often been the people who have held on the longest, and have set the best example. So a signal from wealthy publishers that journalists should not do that is a very negative phenomenon.\u201d Snyder said he also saw the billionaire newspaper owners\u2019 actions not only as a sign of early obedience to Trump, but also as a very clear message to their own employees. \u201cThis pose of neutrality is in fact a signal to the actual investigative journalists that they are not supposed to be doing their jobs,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cIt\u2019s not neutral to say, \u2018We\u2019re going to ignore the evidence of nearly a decade as to what the election of Donald Trump would mean for freedom of speech, the profession of journalism, and the American republic generally.\u201d \u201cTo profess neutrality in such a moment is to say that the work and value of the honest journalist means nothing.\u201d \u2018Media capture\u2019 comes to the US So far, the response from journalists at the papers owned by Bezos and Soon-Shiong has been resistance, some of it coming at a personal cost. Three members of the Los Angeles Times\u2019 editorials board, including the section\u2019s editor and a recent Pulitzer prize winner, have resigned in protest since the news was made public. At least one editor at the Washington Post has also resigned, according to Semafor. At the Los Angeles Times, the news that the paper\u2019s owner had refused to let the editorial board publish a planned endorsement of Kamala Harris was only made public when the opinion page editor, Mariel Garza, spoke publicly about her resignation and why she thought the decision had undermined the paper\u2019s integrity: \u201c\u201cI am resigning because I want to make it clear that I am not okay with us being silent,\u201d Garza told the Columbia Journalism Review. \u201cIn dangerous times, honest people need to stand up.\u201d Unions representing journalists who work at both the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post have made public statements about their members\u2019 concern over the decisions, while also pleading with readers not to cancel their subscriptions to already economically struggling newspapers over the behaviour of their billionaire owners. The Los Angeles Times journalists raised an additional concern in an open letter on Friday: they put a spotlight on the fact that their own paper, unlike the Washington Post, had not yet run a news story on the non-endorsement controversy as of Friday morning. \u201cWe all expect The Times to be transparent with readers. We also expect that our journalists be permitted to thoroughly cover the news of this city \u2013 including when it occurs at this newspaper \u2013 and do their jobs without fear of being blamed for their employer\u2019s decisions,\u201d the journalists wrote. Sheila Coronel, an investigative journalist from the Philippines who is now a professor at the Columbia Journalism School, said the experience of \u201cmedia capture\u201d, in which media outlets are constrained by pressures from the state and corporations or other special interests, is a familiar one for many reporters around the world After the end of the Marcos regime in the Philippines, she said, there was an explosion of new newspapers, many of them established by people who had business or political interests to advance. \u201cI remember one newspaper editor told me: \u2018A newspaper, to them, is like a gun in the holster. You use it when you have to.\u2019\u201d There was a time, she said, when journalists in the Philippines would look to the US, and its first amendment, as a place where journalists had an easier time and more protections. But now, Coronel said, \u201cThe US is becoming increasingly like the rest of the world, right? It\u2019s like a regression to the mean.\u201d \u201cThe way journalists are delegitimized, the way they are insulted, the way they are being relentlessly harassed online, and, to some extent, physically.\u201d That \u201cAmerican notion of press freedom\u201d was rooted in the fact that newspapers and televisions were, for a time, \u201cvibrant businesses\u201d that actually made enough money to support themselves, Coronel said. Profitability guaranteed a degree of independence. That equation changes, she said, \u201cwhen the media is no longer a viable business\u201d, and when it must depend on owners who make their money in other industries, and who have other financial interests to support. \u201cTrump hasn\u2019t even won,\u201d Bassin, the activist who raised concerns about anticipatory obedience, wrote in response to Fridya\u2019s Washington Post\u2019s non-endorsement decision. \u201cTerrifying trajectory for press freedom and independence if he actually returns to power.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 27 October 2024 to correct a reference to \u201canticipatory obedience\u201d from \u201cparticipatory obedience\u201d.",

The ending of a recorded, animated message before the bottom of the eighth sounded more emphatic: \u201cWake up, LA!\u201d The fans awoke that inning when Ohtani lined a double off the top of the right-field wall, then took third base when second baseman Gleyber Torres mishandled Soto\u2019s throw. Betts followed with a sacrifice fly that sent Ohtani home and forced a 2-2 tie. The Yankees regained a 3-2 advantage in the top of the 10th. But in the bottom of the inning \u2013 with the bases loaded, two out and the fans chanting his first name \u2013 Freeman provided the ultimate stimulant by propelling Nestor Cortes\u2019 first pitch, a 92mph fastball, halfway up the right-field bleachers. As the crowd erupted, as the ball soared, Freeman held his bat high and started walking to first base. Once the ball cleared the outfield fence, Freeman started trotting. He exchanged a low five with first-base coach Clayton McCullough, pointed toward left field and smiled, tossed his batting helmet off as he jogged down the third-base line, stomped on home plate and received exuberant hugs from teammates. Then Freeman went to his father sitting near home plate. The two men clasped hands through the netting in celebration. As he was savoring his home-run trot, the Dodgers\u2019 first baseman was \u201cjust kind of floating\u201d, he said. \u201cThose are the kind of things, the scenarios you dream about when you\u2019re five years old with your two older brothers and you\u2019re playing wiffle ball in the backyard: two outs, bases loaded in a World Series game.\u201d Freeman\u2019s father did his part to help his son advance beyond wiffle ball. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t throw me batting practice \u2013 if he didn\u2019t love the game of baseball \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t be here playing this game,\u201d the first baseman said. \u201cHe\u2019s been throwing me batting practice since I can remember. He still throws me batting practice. My swing is because of him. My approach is because of him. I am who I am because of him.\u201d Yet three days before Freeman made his contribution to America\u2019s most storied athletic rivalry, Flaherty essentially said that one home run does not a Series make. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a grind,\u201d Flaherty said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard fought between both sides, and at the end of the day, we\u2019re going to give everything that we got.\u201d Elated fans along the left-field concourse \u2013 including strangers exchanging high fives \u2013 might reply with the word they were chanting as they were leaving Dodger Stadium. \u201cFred-dee, Fred-dee, Fred-dee!\u201d",

      "body": "<p>As Sandro Tonali trudged towards the touchline Eddie Howe looked momentarily puzzled. Then comprehension dawned. As boos, albeit a gentle smattering, greeted his decision to withdraw the Italy midfielder, Newcastle\u2019s manager received a reminder that the widespread adoration he commands on Tyneside is no longer unconditional.</p> <p>It was last Saturday at St James\u2019 Park and, with 65 minutes gone, Newcastle were heading towards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/19/newcastle-brighton-premier-league-match-report\">a 1-0 defeat against Brighton</a>. If the outward show of dissent was muted, plenty of home supporters disagreed with the decision to replace the influential, if tiring, Tonali. Significantly, a manager who prides himself on an ability to read the room conceded his introduction of Joe Willock had failed to exert the desired effect.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/25/eddie-howe-tells-alexander-isak-to-focus-on-football-not-a-new-deal-newcastle-united\">Eddie Howe tells Alexander Isak to \u2018focus on football\u2019 not a new deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Two weeks, 8 November, marks the third anniversary of Howe\u2019s installation at Newcastle but with a largely long-serving squad turning stale and, worryingly, struggling to regain its previous harmony, his once near irrepressible tactical templates are starting to look chipped around the edges.</p> <p>Just over a year ago, Newcastle produced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/04/newcastle-psg-champions-league-match-report\">breathtaking 4-1 Champions League home win</a> over Paris Saint-Germain. Today, though, the fanbase are debating whether the impending three matches \u2013 Chelsea away on Sunday in the Premier League, Wednesday\u2019s Carabao Cup date with Chelsea at St James\u2019 and Arsenal\u2019s league visit on Saturday \u2013 should be regarded as sink or swim fixtures for&nbsp;Howe.</p> <p>While he remains an outstanding coach and no one is really suggesting he should be sacked any time soon, his hopes of leading Newcastle back to Europe and lifting a trophy are being undermined by capricious tailwinds partly outside his control.</p> <p>The high-intensity pressing game that blew PSG, and others, away arguably prompted the series of injuries responsible for last season\u2019s disappointing seventh-placed finish and the appointment of James Bunce as Newcastle\u2019s new performance director. In the hope of minimising soft tissue injuries, Bunce has modified Howe\u2019s demanding training regimen but such tweaks possibly explain the slow start to the campaign.</p> <p>It has left Newcastle mid-table and having scored eight goals in eight league games. The season is far from over, but with Newcastle desperate to secure their first major silverware since 1969, Wednesday\u2019s cup tie seems pivotal.</p> <p>Given that Newcastle\u2019s Saudi Arabian owners certainly do not lack cash, things would surely have been very different had the board not needed to expand the club\u2019s commercial income to comply with the Premier League profit and sustainability rules. Instead, the past two transfer windows have been quiet, leaving Howe short of the new right-winger, centre-half and central striker he craves.</p> <p>The need to meet PSR requirements allied to the departure of minority co-owners Amanda Staveley and Mehrdad Ghodoussi in July have created a sense that behind the scenes, Newcastle have become a bit corporate, slightly soulless even.</p>    <p>Meanwhile, a summer involving key performers Alexander Isak, Bruno Guimar\u00e3es and Anthony Gordon becoming the subject of transfer speculation and the manager being linked with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/18/eddie-howe-fa-england-manager-role-thomas-tuchel-newcastle\">England job</a> disrupted once watertight unity. The contentious decision to replace Kieran Trippier as captain with the more emotional Guimar\u00e3es only exacerbated any fault lines.</p> <p>For some time the 34-year-old Trippier served as the lodestar of Newcastle\u2019s metamorphosis but the team miss the full-back\u2019s leadership qualities and his stellar crossing and dead ball deliveries. Tino Livramento is a sufficiently talented right-back to be part of the England squad but he is not as transformational an attacking outlet as Trippier at his best. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/21/premier-league-saudi-arabia-newcastle-deal-mohammed-bin-salman\">Premier League will not review Saudi Newcastle deal after Bin Salman claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was a difficult summer, for lots of different reasons, for a catalogue of things,\u201d says Howe. \u201cWhen you have multiple players affected by different things, it becomes harder. The general feel of the squad at the start of the season was different to previous years.</p> <p>\u201cMy job is to get the focus and harmony back where it should be, but it\u2019s taking longer than we initially hoped. We\u2019ve come through some really rocky spells in the past but underpinning the strength of the group was always a sense of duty, professionalism, love for the club and positive momentum. It meant we could ride through some difficult patches.</p> <p>\u201cNow we\u2019ve just got to make sure all those qualities are underpinning the squad again because our ability is unquestionable. But for every player to be at their best, there needs to be that unity, that ambition.\u201d</p> <p>Dressing rooms are fragile ecosystems and, as Newcastle enter a potentially season-defining seven days, Howe accepts a watershed moment beckons. \u201cI\u2019ve seen things, very quickly, go the wrong way in football,\u201d he says. \u201cSo everyone connected with Newcastle has a big job to try to keep that momentum positive and the dreams really big. That\u2019s absolutely crucial.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "As Sandro Tonali trudged towards the touchline Eddie Howe looked momentarily puzzled. Then comprehension dawned. As boos, albeit a gentle smattering, greeted his decision to withdraw the Italy midfielder, Newcastle\u2019s manager received a reminder that the widespread adoration he commands on Tyneside is no longer unconditional. It was last Saturday at St James\u2019 Park and, with 65 minutes gone, Newcastle were heading towards a 1-0 defeat against Brighton. If the outward show of dissent was muted, plenty of home supporters disagreed with the decision to replace the influential, if tiring, Tonali. Significantly, a manager who prides himself on an ability to read the room conceded his introduction of Joe Willock had failed to exert the desired effect. Two weeks, 8 November, marks the third anniversary of Howe\u2019s installation at Newcastle but with a largely long-serving squad turning stale and, worryingly, struggling to regain its previous harmony, his once near irrepressible tactical templates are starting to look chipped around the edges. Just over a year ago, Newcastle produced a breathtaking 4-1 Champions League home win over Paris Saint-Germain. Today, though, the fanbase are debating whether the impending three matches \u2013 Chelsea away on Sunday in the Premier League, Wednesday\u2019s Carabao Cup date with Chelsea at St James\u2019 and Arsenal\u2019s league visit on Saturday \u2013 should be regarded as sink or swim fixtures for Howe. While he remains an outstanding coach and no one is really suggesting he should be sacked any time soon, his hopes of leading Newcastle back to Europe and lifting a trophy are being undermined by capricious tailwinds partly outside his control. The high-intensity pressing game that blew PSG, and others, away arguably prompted the series of injuries responsible for last season\u2019s disappointing seventh-placed finish and the appointment of James Bunce as Newcastle\u2019s new performance director. In the hope of minimising soft tissue injuries, Bunce has modified Howe\u2019s demanding training regimen but such tweaks possibly explain the slow start to the campaign. It has left Newcastle mid-table and having scored eight goals in eight league games. The season is far from over, but with Newcastle desperate to secure their first major silverware since 1969, Wednesday\u2019s cup tie seems pivotal. Given that Newcastle\u2019s Saudi Arabian owners certainly do not lack cash, things would surely have been very different had the board not needed to expand the club\u2019s commercial income to comply with the Premier League profit and sustainability rules. Instead, the past two transfer windows have been quiet, leaving Howe short of the new right-winger, centre-half and central striker he craves. The need to meet PSR requirements allied to the departure of minority co-owners Amanda Staveley and Mehrdad Ghodoussi in July have created a sense that behind the scenes, Newcastle have become a bit corporate, slightly soulless even. Meanwhile, a summer involving key performers Alexander Isak, Bruno Guimar\u00e3es and Anthony Gordon becoming the subject of transfer speculation and the manager being linked with the England job disrupted once watertight unity. The contentious decision to replace Kieran Trippier as captain with the more emotional Guimar\u00e3es only exacerbated any fault lines. For some time the 34-year-old Trippier served as the lodestar of Newcastle\u2019s metamorphosis but the team miss the full-back\u2019s leadership qualities and his stellar crossing and dead ball deliveries. Tino Livramento is a sufficiently talented right-back to be part of the England squad but he is not as transformational an attacking outlet as Trippier at his best. \u201cIt was a difficult summer, for lots of different reasons, for a catalogue of things,\u201d says Howe. \u201cWhen you have multiple players affected by different things, it becomes harder. The general feel of the squad at the start of the season was different to previous years. \u201cMy job is to get the focus and harmony back where it should be, but it\u2019s taking longer than we initially hoped. We\u2019ve come through some really rocky spells in the past but underpinning the strength of the group was always a sense of duty, professionalism, love for the club and positive momentum. It meant we could ride through some difficult patches. \u201cNow we\u2019ve just got to make sure all those qualities are underpinning the squad again because our ability is unquestionable. But for every player to be at their best, there needs to be that unity, that ambition.\u201d Dressing rooms are fragile ecosystems and, as Newcastle enter a potentially season-defining seven days, Howe accepts a watershed moment beckons. \u201cI\u2019ve seen things, very quickly, go the wrong way in football,\u201d he says. \u201cSo everyone connected with Newcastle has a big job to try to keep that momentum positive and the dreams really big. That\u2019s absolutely crucial.\u201d",

A host of business owners, already seasoned Dodgers fans, were quick to create Ohtani-themed menu specials to support the hero from their homeland. A towering mural of the two-way star adorning the Miyako Hotel has become a top tourist attraction, drawing legions of new shoppers and diners to revitalize a historic enclave under growing threats of gentrification and displacement.</p> \n<p>In the country\u2019s second-oldest Japantown, the impact of Ohtani\u2019s 10-year, $700m contract with the Dodgers has been stratospheric. Adam Burke, the president and CEO of Los Angeles\u2019s tourism board, said it\u2019s possible the number of Japanese tourists to the city could exceed 400,000 this year, nearly doubling total visitors from 2023. The Miyako Hotel\u2019s general manager said 98% of its occupants on game days were there to watch Ohtani.</p> \n<p>Mariko Lochridge, the small-business coordinator at the nonprofit Little Tokyo Service Center, said while love for Ohtani has clearly boosted tourism from Japan, his more lasting impact is on increasing the visibility of Japanese language and pop culture in the US.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe long-term effect of Ohtani fever is on the \u2018cool factor\u2019 of Little Tokyo because our identity is tied to Japan,\u201d Lochridge said. \u201cIt gives us hope that people will find the neighborhood and fall in love with it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Along the four streets that make up historic Little Tokyo, bars and dessert joints are turning food into Ohtani merch. The confectionery Fugetsu-Do, which has been making mochi for 121 years, launched the \u201cSho-mochi\u201d: Dodger-blue wrapping filled with white chocolate and ganache.

Some would visit the bar afterward.</p> \n<p>The mural towers over Bunkado, a family-owned gift shop that opened in 1946. Natsuki Quartz, who runs Nostalgiana, a crafts pop-up stand that carries traditional Japanese products like teacup candles and vintage kimono coasters, said she rarely saw any Japanese customers come into the store until Ohtani joined the Dodgers. Since the mural was unveiled in March, she estimated that total visitors to the gift shop has more than doubled from the year before, often reaching more than 500 people on busy days.</p> \n<p>\u201cOhtani-san for sure has made a big change to Little Tokyo,\u201d Quartz said, addressing Ohtani by the Japanese honorific. \u201cRather than just going to restaurants here, people are now looking to experience Japanese culture, too.\u201d</p> \n<p>At Mr Ramen, the last family-owned and operated ramen shop on First Street, Ohtani mania has ushered in an avalanche of sales from new customers eager to experience Japanese food, said co-owner Ryusei Yamamoto.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a big influx of people who are interested in the Japanese community,\u201d said Yamamoto, 36. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing of people who speak Japanese and know Japanese culture and history moving back to Little Tokyo.\u201d</p> \n<p>Like Far Bar, Mr Ramen has capitalized on Ohtani\u2019s star power, offering 50% off the first 17 bowls of ramen the day after he hits a home run. While the majority of the restaurant\u2019s patrons are LA residents, Yamamoto said Ohtani has brought in a swell of Japanese tourists and visitors from out of state.</p> \n<p>The resurgence came after a particularly arduous stretch in the restaurant\u2019s history. Yamamoto\u2019s father, who founded Mr. Ramen in 1993, died suddenly in 2020, leaving him and his two younger brothers with the difficult choice of selling or taking over the business. The three sons wanted to work in music and acting, but decided to rebuild the restaurant to honor their parents\u2019 legacy.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we sold for the lowballing amount people offered us during Covid,\u201d Yamamoto said, \u201chow disrespectful would it be to our parents?\u201d</p> \n<p>Yamamoto said Little Tokyo is experiencing a resurgence that he hopes will continue. Yet, development pressures remain a serious existential threat for family-owned establishments in Little Tokyo, which turned 140 years old this summer.

      "body": "<h2>The abortion surveillance state</h2> <p>Ever heard of <a href=\"https://www.babelstreet.com/babel-street-analytics?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwg-24BhB_EiwA1ZOx8vteK2NWjHvnitxTx8f1Orl8uu3HWpU-QIgh5hnUML7bOmt_TvyIAxoC5j0QAvD_BwE\">Babel Street</a>? Unless you\u2019re a data and analytics enthusiast, it\u2019s likely you haven\u2019t. The Virginia-based technology company isn\u2019t a household name the way that Google and Facebook are. And yet the company most likely knows a hell of a lot about you and everyone else in your household.</p> <p>Babel Street, you see, has a people-tracking service called Locate X, that allows customers to track individual mobile users by their Mobile Advertising ID: a string of characters that uniquely identifies your phone or other smart device. Where it gets really creepy is that, according to recent reporting from <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/10/the-global-surveillance-free-for-all-in-mobile-ad-data/?ref=404media.co\">Krebs on Security</a> and other outlets, Babel Street allows its customers, which include government agencies, to \u201cdraw a digital polygon around nearly any location on a map of the world, and view a slightly dated (by a few days) time-lapse history of the mobile devices seen coming in and out of the specified area\u201d.</p> <p>What does this mean? Well, among many other disturbing things, it means that you could use Locate X to zoom in on an abortion clinic and see exactly who is going in and out of it. In fact, this is exactly what a group of privacy advocates recently did. They looked at an abortion clinic in Florida and tracked one individual leaving it. Then they leaked a video of the demonstration to media outlets including 404 Media.</p> <p>\u201cThis phone started at a residence in Alabama in mid-June,\u201d 404 Media says in a description of the demonstration. \u201cIt then went by a Lowe\u2019s Home Improvement store, traveled along a highway, went past a gas station, visited a church, crossed over into Florida, and then stopped at the abortion clinic for approximately two hours.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t immediately obvious who the individual being tracked was. However, 404 Media notes that \u201cit would be trivial for US authorities, some of which already have access to this tool, to go one step further and unmask this or other abortion clinic visitors\u201d.</p> <p>Locate X\u2019s location-tracking capabilities aren\u2019t new news: the service has popped up in various headlines over the years. In 2020, for example, it <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/secret-service-phone-location-data-babel-street/\">was reported</a> that the US Secret Service (USSS) had signed a contract to use Locate X.

      "body": "<p>The Cure have long dwelled in a kind of rarefied artistic blue zone in which the years pile up but the end of the band is serenely defied \u2013 maybe due to a diet rich in red wine, combined with a dogged aversion to modernity. Band leader Robert Smith does not own a smartphone; the band\u2019s consumption of polyphenols in the 1980s was legendary.</p> <p>Having crested <a href=\"https://www.thecure.com/\">the Cure</a>\u2019s jubilant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/03/the-cure-anniversary-1978-2018-live-in-hyde-park-london-review-robert-smith-tim-pope\">40th anniversary</a> in 2018, Smith swiftly announced a new album for release in 2019. Cure songs often tend to take a little while to warm up \u2013 the introduction to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx9SVAtMkJM\">Alone</a>, the opening track of <em>Songs of a Lost World</em>, clocks in at six minutes; three minutes elapse before Smith draws breath to sing. Likewise, a mere five years on from that announcement (including two years of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/10/the-cure-first-direct-arena-leeds-live-review-the-doyens-of-doom\">generous, fan-pleasing gigs</a>), the first new Cure album since 2008 has finally been deemed ready to drop.</p> <p>At a succinct eight tracks and a downright sprightly 49-minute run time, it\u2019s a thunderous statement on grief, anomie and regret \u2013 and the passage of time, a specialist subject. What you might call \u201cthe drear oblivion of lost things\u201d, according to the Victorian poet Ernest Dowson \u2013 whose <a href=\"https://allpoetry.com/poem/8509801-Dregs-by-Ernest-Christopher-Dowson\">Dregs</a> became the jumping-off point for Alone \u2013 is a major focus.</p>    <p>All, pretty much, is lost: youth, loved ones, the familiar. The album\u2019s cover does away with the squiggly artwork long favoured by the band, to be replaced by a lump of half-formed granite: <em>Bagatelle</em>, a 1975 work by Janez Pirnat, redolent of a damaged classical sculpture rescued from beneath the waves. Its grey tones recall the cover of <em><a href=\"https://www.thecure.com/release/faith/\">Faith</a></em>, the band\u2019s dolorous epic from 1981.</p> <p>Throughout their history, the Cure have very often bucked the gothic thumbnail sketch of their output by rotating through crisp post-punk (the early years), romantic whimsy (the pop songs) and wild psychedelic disarray (<em>Pornography</em>). Existential melancholy is, though, their calling card bar none. And <em>Songs of a Lost World</em> delivers resonantly on the first part of Smith\u2019s promise of a triptych of new material: one album that\u2019s \u201cvery, very doom and gloom\u201d, one that \u201cisn\u2019t\u201d, and a solo work of \u201cnoise\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Another theme eats caustically away at many of these songs: the question of Smith\u2019s own selfhood</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is a record that dolefully eats its own tail, an ouroboros of bleak finality that begins with Alone (\u201cthis is the end of every song that we sing\u2026 we toast, with bitter dregs, to our emptiness\u201d) and concludes with the stately, remorseless <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKwhA1A_qn4\">Endsong</a> (\u201cIt\u2019s all gone, it\u2019s all gone, it\u2019s all gone, left alone with nothing, at the end of every song\u201d). The latter\u2019s lead guitar part feels like an acidic paean to the foolishness of strutting and fretting even a minute upon the stage, much like Hendrix upended The Star-Spangled Banner into a rebuttal of the Vietnam war.</p> <p>Both of these bookends benefit from the emphatic pummel of Jason Cooper\u2019s drum kit, driving home the message of inexorability. These tracks were written in response to a spate of losses among Smith\u2019s family and friends pre-pandemic, but encompass the sucker punch of 2020-21 too; birds fall from the sky, nodding to the climate crisis. The most direct track is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-62c9yKf_Co\">I Can Never Say Goodbye</a>, marking the passing of Richard, the music-savvy elder brother looked up to by the young Smith. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qh-1-Bo4bk\">And Nothing Is Forever</a> \u2013 laden with piano and strings \u2013 deals with his deep regret at having made a promise to be with someone on their deathbed, one he could not keep. Another theme eats caustically away at many of these songs: the question of Smith\u2019s own selfhood. It seems to be fracturing, even as every music fan has a pretty solid idea of who this monumental figure is.</p> <p>The stage is set for <em>Songs of a Lost World</em> to be lugubrious and overwrought from end to end. Wisely, Smith opts to spike his pain with bitterness and paranoia too. Warsong musters the sour hum of organ to deal with an intractable conflict: two people locked in enmity for ever.</p> <p>The record\u2019s crowning glory, though, is its unexpected pop banger, Drone: Nodrone, a pacier, snarkier cut about self-doubt prompted by the arrival of a drone above Smith\u2019s garden. In the lyrics, he is initially full of caustic bewilderment; his centre is not holding.

      "bodyText": "The Cure have long dwelled in a kind of rarefied artistic blue zone in which the years pile up but the end of the band is serenely defied \u2013 maybe due to a diet rich in red wine, combined with a dogged aversion to modernity. Band leader Robert Smith does not own a smartphone; the band\u2019s consumption of polyphenols in the 1980s was legendary. Having crested the Cure\u2019s jubilant 40th anniversary in 2018, Smith swiftly announced a new album for release in 2019. Cure songs often tend to take a little while to warm up \u2013 the introduction to Alone, the opening track of Songs of a Lost World, clocks in at six minutes; three minutes elapse before Smith draws breath to sing. Likewise, a mere five years on from that announcement (including two years of generous, fan-pleasing gigs), the first new Cure album since 2008 has finally been deemed ready to drop. At a succinct eight tracks and a downright sprightly 49-minute run time, it\u2019s a thunderous statement on grief, anomie and regret \u2013 and the passage of time, a specialist subject. What you might call \u201cthe drear oblivion of lost things\u201d, according to the Victorian poet Ernest Dowson \u2013 whose Dregs became the jumping-off point for Alone \u2013 is a major focus. All, pretty much, is lost: youth, loved ones, the familiar. The album\u2019s cover does away with the squiggly artwork long favoured by the band, to be replaced by a lump of half-formed granite: Bagatelle, a 1975 work by Janez Pirnat, redolent of a damaged classical sculpture rescued from beneath the waves. Its grey tones recall the cover of Faith, the band\u2019s dolorous epic from 1981. Throughout their history, the Cure have very often bucked the gothic thumbnail sketch of their output by rotating through crisp post-punk (the early years), romantic whimsy (the pop songs) and wild psychedelic disarray (Pornography). Existential melancholy is, though, their calling card bar none. And Songs of a Lost World delivers resonantly on the first part of Smith\u2019s promise of a triptych of new material: one album that\u2019s \u201cvery, very doom and gloom\u201d, one that \u201cisn\u2019t\u201d, and a solo work of \u201cnoise\u201d. This is a record that dolefully eats its own tail, an ouroboros of bleak finality that begins with Alone (\u201cthis is the end of every song that we sing\u2026 we toast, with bitter dregs, to our emptiness\u201d) and concludes with the stately, remorseless Endsong (\u201cIt\u2019s all gone, it\u2019s all gone, it\u2019s all gone, left alone with nothing, at the end of every song\u201d). The latter\u2019s lead guitar part feels like an acidic paean to the foolishness of strutting and fretting even a minute upon the stage, much like Hendrix upended The Star-Spangled Banner into a rebuttal of the Vietnam war. Both of these bookends benefit from the emphatic pummel of Jason Cooper\u2019s drum kit, driving home the message of inexorability. These tracks were written in response to a spate of losses among Smith\u2019s family and friends pre-pandemic, but encompass the sucker punch of 2020-21 too; birds fall from the sky, nodding to the climate crisis. The most direct track is I Can Never Say Goodbye, marking the passing of Richard, the music-savvy elder brother looked up to by the young Smith. And Nothing Is Forever \u2013 laden with piano and strings \u2013 deals with his deep regret at having made a promise to be with someone on their deathbed, one he could not keep. Another theme eats caustically away at many of these songs: the question of Smith\u2019s own selfhood. It seems to be fracturing, even as every music fan has a pretty solid idea of who this monumental figure is. The stage is set for Songs of a Lost World to be lugubrious and overwrought from end to end. Wisely, Smith opts to spike his pain with bitterness and paranoia too. Warsong musters the sour hum of organ to deal with an intractable conflict: two people locked in enmity for ever. The record\u2019s crowning glory, though, is its unexpected pop banger, Drone: Nodrone, a pacier, snarkier cut about self-doubt prompted by the arrival of a drone above Smith\u2019s garden. In the lyrics, he is initially full of caustic bewilderment; his centre is not holding. But soon we\u2019re back on message, into the record\u2019s unified thematic groove, with Smith \u201cstaring down the barrel of the same warm gun\u201d. The direction of travel is \u2013 yes \u2013 \u201cdown, down, down\u201d. But here, Smith and the rest of the Cure are full of fight and electricity, with melodies to spare. Bring on the next two records.",

Mitchell also mentioned the UK government\u2019s decision in 2013 to recognise the torture of Kenyans by British colonial forces during the Mau Mau uprising, which resulted in a \u00a320m payout. \u201cI have no doubt \u2026. that the arc of history always goes in the right direction,\u201d he said. </p> <p>An expert said the summit could come to be seen as historic.

Asked after the summit what form the discussions would take, Patricia Scotland, the outgoing secretary general of the Commonwealth, said: \u201cOur Commonwealth is going to take exactly the same approach to considering these matters \u2026 that they have taken to every difficult issue which has been painful and has been a matter of concern for our members.\u201d Starmer downplayed the significance of the section in question. \u201cThe slave trade, slave practice, was abhorrent, and it\u2019s very important that we start from there. Abhorrent is the right word,\u201d the prime minister told reporters in Samoa. \u201cThere is \u2026 the paragraph in the communique about reparatory justice, which does two things: it notes calls for discussion and it agrees that this is the time for a conversation.\u201d He said the section on reparations was a small part of \u201cquite a long communique\u201d and that the \u201cabsolute priority\u201d for Commonwealth countries at the summit had been to discuss resilience to the climate crisis. The prime minister added that the next opportunity to discuss the issue would be the UK-Caribbean Forum next year. During the summit, he told other leaders he recognised the \u201cstrength of feeling\u201d about reparations. The communique\u2019s section on reparatory justice referred not just to the slave trade across the Atlantic but also to the Pacific. It said most Commonwealth countries \u201cshare common historical experiences in relation to this abhorrent trade, chattel enslavement, the debilitation and dispossession of Indigenous people\u201d. It referred to the \u201cenduring effects\u201d of slavery and mentioned the practice of \u201cblackbirding\u201d, where Pacific islanders were forced into slave or cheap labour in colonies including Australia. The document said: \u201cHeads, noting calls for discussions on reparatory justice with regard to the transatlantic trade in enslaved Africans and chattel enslavement, and recognising the importance of this matter to member states of the Commonwealth \u2026 agreed that the time has come for a meaningful, truthful and respectful conversation towards forging a common future based on equity. \u201cHeads further agreed to continue playing an active role in bringing about such inclusive conversations addressing these harms, paying special attention to women and girls, who suffered disproportionately from these appalling tragedies in the history of humanity.\u201d Starmer said none of the discussions at the summit had concerned money. \u201cWell, no figure,\u201d Frederick Mitchell, the foreign minister of the Bahamas told BBC Radio\u2019s Today programme on Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens going forward.\u201d He said he hoped a report on the issue would follow, which nations would discuss in the future. Mitchell also mentioned the UK government\u2019s decision in 2013 to recognise the torture of Kenyans by British colonial forces during the Mau Mau uprising, which resulted in a \u00a320m payout. \u201cI have no doubt \u2026. that the arc of history always goes in the right direction,\u201d he said. An expert said the summit could come to be seen as historic. Kingsley Abbott, the director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies at the University of London, said: \u201cThe commitment to conversations on reparatory justice wedges open the door for dialogue. \u201cThe Commonwealth and its new secretary general should see this as an opportunity to lead on a potentially historic process, and to do so with vision and courage.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Two hundred years before that hilarious farce<em> </em><em>The Play That Goes Wrong</em><em> </em>became a West End hit, Italian playwrights had come up with a similar comic formula, targeting the often disastrous nature of rehearsals before a show. Later, Gaetano<strong> </strong>Donizetti grabbed the idea and took it into the realm of opera, walking us backstage to witness the tantrums, jealousies, fist-fights and sheer panic that sets in when the clock is ticking inexorably towards curtain-up.</p> <p>His two-act comedy <strong><a href=\"https://www.wexfordopera.com/programme/festival-programme/le-convenienze-ed-inconvenienze-teatrali\">Le convenienze ed inconvenienze teatrali</a></strong><strong> </strong>this year joins a laudably long list of rarely heard works revived by Ireland\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.wexfordopera.com/\">Wexford Festival Opera</a> since 1951. It\u2019s a piece that fits perfectly into this season\u2019s theme of \u201ctheatre within theatre\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.orphaphelan.com/\">Orpha Phelan</a>\u2019s brilliantly inventive new production, graced with a golden cast, has the whole house rocking with laughter from start to finish. </p> <p>Canadian coloratura soprano Sharleen Joynt combines superb technique with great comic timing as the impossible prima donna Daria, who refuses to rehearse with a mere <em>secondo</em> soprano Luigia (Paola Leoci) \u2013 a decision that hastens the arrival of every director\u2019s nightmare: Luigia\u2019s domineering mother, Agata, played by the outrageous bass-baritone Paolo Bordogna. Agata steamrollers her way into the opera, shamelessly promoting her daughter, demanding cuts and rewrites and ignoring all objections. She can\u2019t read music, sings badly, dances hilariously (even on pointe) and scatters cheerful catastrophe wherever she goes. It\u2019s a wonderful performance.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Stanford was plainly not above mercilessly lampooning opera\u2019s pretensions, plots and stars</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Wexford\u2019s new edition of this firecracker updates the 19th-century tradition of including in it music not written by the composer; the tenor Guglielmo (Alberto Robert) turns up thinking he\u2019s rehearsing <em>The Sound of Music</em>.

      "bodyText": "Two hundred years before that hilarious farce The Play That Goes Wrong became a West End hit, Italian playwrights had come up with a similar comic formula, targeting the often disastrous nature of rehearsals before a show. Later, Gaetano Donizetti grabbed the idea and took it into the realm of opera, walking us backstage to witness the tantrums, jealousies, fist-fights and sheer panic that sets in when the clock is ticking inexorably towards curtain-up. His two-act comedy Le convenienze ed inconvenienze teatrali this year joins a laudably long list of rarely heard works revived by Ireland\u2019s Wexford Festival Opera since 1951. It\u2019s a piece that fits perfectly into this season\u2019s theme of \u201ctheatre within theatre\u201d. Orpha Phelan\u2019s brilliantly inventive new production, graced with a golden cast, has the whole house rocking with laughter from start to finish. Canadian coloratura soprano Sharleen Joynt combines superb technique with great comic timing as the impossible prima donna Daria, who refuses to rehearse with a mere secondo soprano Luigia (Paola Leoci) \u2013 a decision that hastens the arrival of every director\u2019s nightmare: Luigia\u2019s domineering mother, Agata, played by the outrageous bass-baritone Paolo Bordogna. Agata steamrollers her way into the opera, shamelessly promoting her daughter, demanding cuts and rewrites and ignoring all objections. She can\u2019t read music, sings badly, dances hilariously (even on pointe) and scatters cheerful catastrophe wherever she goes. It\u2019s a wonderful performance. Wexford\u2019s new edition of this firecracker updates the 19th-century tradition of including in it music not written by the composer; the tenor Guglielmo (Alberto Robert) turns up thinking he\u2019s rehearsing The Sound of Music. Later we get a very classy burst of Leonard Bernstein\u2019s Candide. Amy Share-Kissiov devises some terrific dancing, and Danila Grassi conducts the festival orchestra with passion and precision. At the curtain call she wept as the opening night\u2019s rapturous applause rang out; surely not the only tears of joy shed that night.

      "body": "<p>I\u2019ve been writing about beauty for almost two decades, and in that time my ardent pursuit of hacks and game-changing advice has had two goals: to make my routine faster, and to get a better overall effect.</p> <p>Over the last few years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/anita-bhagwandas\">my weekly columns</a> for the Guardian have taken that quest to the next frontier. I\u2019ve tried every viral beauty trend going. TikTok, in particular, is awash with DIY beauty tips to make our lives easier.</p> <p>Honestly, I\u2019d say a solid 80% of what I\u2019ve tried was utter tripe, and actually designed to court attention for being outlandish. But amid all the trial and error, there has been a smattering of hacks that are genuinely useful. </p> <p>More recently, I\u2019ve answered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/the-beauty-q-a\">your pressing questions about beauty</a> every week, and it\u2019s clear that people feel overwhelmed by how many products and treatments there are on offer \u2013 a feeling I share even as a beauty editor. </p> <p>I\u2019ve also been floored by the response I\u2019ve had every time I\u2019ve written about my struggle with eczema \u2013 which at its worst can feel uncontrollable, painful and with no end in sight. It\u2019s clearly a topic that resonates because it affects so many people, and yet is seldom spoken about in the mainstream press (the same applies for conditions such as psoriasis or rosacea). Through trial and error I found<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Skin-Cream-Natural-Chinese-Relief/dp/B0D92FX3ND/\">Meitrend Natural Face Cream</a><strong> </strong>(\u00a311.99), a steroid-free product using traditional Chinese medical herbs, helps me manage flare-ups, and <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-8206421\">Av</a><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/av%C3%A8ne-tol%C3%89rance-soothing-skin-recovery-cream-40ml-10298238?https%3A%2F%2Fwww.boots.com%2Fav%C3%A8ne-tol%C3%89rance-soothing-skin-recovery-cream-40ml-10298238%3Fcm_mmc=bmm-buk-google-ppc-_-PLAs_HeroCompare-_--_-pmax_skincare__gg_shopping__hc-skincare___pmedia&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;utm_source=ShopMy-740219&amp;amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Editorial+Content&amp;amp;utm_term=&amp;amp;utm_content=&amp;amp;sv1=affiliate&amp;amp;sv_campaign_id=740219&amp;amp;awc=2041_1727962862_1d3254dcdd4328b22bdb1d12cdbd009e\">\u00e8</a><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/av%C3%A8ne-tol%C3%89rance-soothing-skin-recovery-cream-40ml-10298238\">ne\u2019s Tolerance Control Soothing Skin Recovery Cream for Sensitive Skin</a> (\u00a321) soothes my skin, too.</p>    <p>Readers have been so honest with me, which I have always appreciated. I know as well as anyone the shame that can go with feeling unhappy with your appearance and have written about it in my book <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/ugly-9781788705356/\">Ugly: Why the World Became Beauty-Obsessed and How to Break Free</a>. In our age of supposed inclusivity and body positivity, we\u2019re still struggling to fit into the beauty norms that our generation has grown up with. Many of the questions I\u2019ve received are from readers who care deeply about what others think of their appearance and ask for ways to navigate the ageing process \u2013 which, sadly, is impossible to fix in a 300\u2011word weekly column.</p> <p>One of the things that\u2019s helped me dial down the toxic messaging around getting older has been filling my life, TV screens and social media feed with people who are ageing on their own terms, from their sartorial and beauty choices through to defying societal and gender expectations of what 50, 60 and 70 \u201clooks like\u201d<strong> </strong>\u2013 people like actors Chlo\u00eb Sevigny and Poorna Jagannathan and fashion icons Mich\u00e8le Lamy and the late Iris Apfel.<strong> </strong>That has helped to mitigate some of the pressure to freeze time and age backwards.</p> <p>So, as my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/the-beauty-q-and-a\">Beauty Q&amp;A column</a> comes to a close, it feels as though it is the right time to share my truly top tips: these are the products and tricks that are actually worth your time and money. </p>    <h2><strong>The key to perfect coverage \u2026</strong></h2> <p>Should you apply your foundation with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/nov/06/is-using-a-straw-to-apply-foundation-and-blusher-a-good-idea\">straw?</a> Unsurprisingly, the answer is a resounding no. However, what changed the way I apply my foundation and concealer is using the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/19/can-i-get-the-no-makeup-look-using-the-pros-patchwork-method\">patchwork</a>\u201d method, which is how professional makeup artists such as Lisa Eldridge, who coined the term, apply it.</p> <p>Instead of slathering foundation all over your face, which can look dry and cakey, use your base products with a small brush in the smallest amounts and only apply to parts of the face you think need it. Leave the rest of your skin natural, and blend until the patchwork of real skin and made-up skin is seamless.</p> <p>Whenever I\u2019ve done this I can see I look measurably fresher in both photos and in the mirror \u2013 although it can take a little longer than the \u201cslather and go\u201d method.</p> <h2><strong>\u2026 and how to keep it off your clothes</strong></h2> <p>Make sure you <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/29/can-hairspray-protect-white-clothing-from-makeup-smears\">spray your clothes</a> with hairspray to protect them from makeup transfer. I was elated when I discovered this hack.</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t be swayed by others\u2019 opinions of you</strong></h2> <p>Makeup is an incredible way to express yourself. That\u2019s why I also rate the idea of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/nov/20/can-unapproachable-makeup-work-as-a-man-repellent\">unapproachable makeup</a>\u201d, from the TikTokers using bold makeup as a \u201cman repellant\u201d to subvert the traditional notion of pretty makeup, aimed at the male gaze.</p> <p>I do believe that makeup should be expressive and feel joyful rather than used to cover up or hide. But if a bold look repels anyone, of any gender, because they\u2019re judgmental about your appearance, then that\u2019s an added bonus.</p>    <h2><strong>The e</strong><strong>ye</strong><strong>-makeup trick that gives </strong><strong>Sophia Loren glamour</strong></h2> <p>One of the hacks I\u2019m still enamoured with is the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/oct/31/how-to-get-sultry-sophia-loren-style-siren-eyes\">siren eyes</a>\u201d, TikTok\u2019s take on the ever-popular winged eyeliner look. Instead of a clean flicked-out wing, doing your liner with an eyeshadow or pencil to create a gentle elongated line looks softer and is far easier.</p> <p>I use an <a href=\"https://www.allbeauty.com/estee-lauder-double-wear-24-hour-waterproof-gel-eye-pencil-12g-various-shades/13496474.html\">Est\u00e9e Lauder Waterproof Gel Eye Pencil</a> (\u00a317.95), and then flick the edges out using a good <a href=\"https://www.lookfantastic.com/p/bobbi-brown-ultra-precise-eyeliner-brush/11512193/\">eyeliner brush</a> such as Bobbi Brown\u2019s Ultra Precise Eyeliner Brush (\u00a329) before the liner sets.</p>    <h2><strong>The hack I share most in real life</strong></h2> <p>If you struggle with strong-smelling sweat and body odour, using <a href=\"https://www.boots.com/acnecide-face-wash-5-percent-w-w-gel-50g-10289479\">Acnecide,</a> an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/24/can-underarm-odour-be-eliminated-using-face-cleanser\">antibacterial</a> face wash (\u00a310.99), in the shower kills any bacteria under the arms that causes our usually odourless sweat to smell grim. </p> <h2><strong>Reframe your routine</strong></h2> <p>According to TikTok, we should all be having an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/01/should-an-everything-shower-be-a-weekly-selfcare-ritual\">everything shower</a>\u201d, a weekly slot to blitz everything in one go: optional hair removal, exfoliation and a face mask etc. I\u2019ve always done this on Monday evenings as a regular routine, but giving it a name is fun \u2013 certainly better than the depressing \u201cbeauty admin hour\u201d, which is what I had it down in my diary as previously.</p>    <h2><strong>LED masks: my verdict</strong></h2> <p>I receive a lot of questions about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/article/2024/jun/03/would-infrared-light-therapy-improve-the-elasticity-of-my-south-asian-skin\">LED face masks,</a> probably because they\u2019re an investment buy.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ve been writing about beauty for almost two decades, and in that time my ardent pursuit of hacks and game-changing advice has had two goals: to make my routine faster, and to get a better overall effect. Over the last few years, my weekly columns for the Guardian have taken that quest to the next frontier. I\u2019ve tried every viral beauty trend going. TikTok, in particular, is awash with DIY beauty tips to make our lives easier. Honestly, I\u2019d say a solid 80% of what I\u2019ve tried was utter tripe, and actually designed to court attention for being outlandish. But amid all the trial and error, there has been a smattering of hacks that are genuinely useful. More recently, I\u2019ve answered your pressing questions about beauty every week, and it\u2019s clear that people feel overwhelmed by how many products and treatments there are on offer \u2013 a feeling I share even as a beauty editor. I\u2019ve also been floored by the response I\u2019ve had every time I\u2019ve written about my struggle with eczema \u2013 which at its worst can feel uncontrollable, painful and with no end in sight. It\u2019s clearly a topic that resonates because it affects so many people, and yet is seldom spoken about in the mainstream press (the same applies for conditions such as psoriasis or rosacea). Through trial and error I found Meitrend Natural Face Cream (\u00a311.99), a steroid-free product using traditional Chinese medical herbs, helps me manage flare-ups, and Av\u00e8ne\u2019s Tolerance Control Soothing Skin Recovery Cream for Sensitive Skin (\u00a321) soothes my skin, too. Readers have been so honest with me, which I have always appreciated. I know as well as anyone the shame that can go with feeling unhappy with your appearance and have written about it in my book Ugly: Why the World Became Beauty-Obsessed and How to Break Free. In our age of supposed inclusivity and body positivity, we\u2019re still struggling to fit into the beauty norms that our generation has grown up with. Many of the questions I\u2019ve received are from readers who care deeply about what others think of their appearance and ask for ways to navigate the ageing process \u2013 which, sadly, is impossible to fix in a 300\u2011word weekly column. One of the things that\u2019s helped me dial down the toxic messaging around getting older has been filling my life, TV screens and social media feed with people who are ageing on their own terms, from their sartorial and beauty choices through to defying societal and gender expectations of what 50, 60 and 70 \u201clooks like\u201d \u2013 people like actors Chlo\u00eb Sevigny and Poorna Jagannathan and fashion icons Mich\u00e8le Lamy and the late Iris Apfel. That has helped to mitigate some of the pressure to freeze time and age backwards. So, as my Beauty Q&amp;A column comes to a close, it feels as though it is the right time to share my truly top tips: these are the products and tricks that are actually worth your time and money. The key to perfect coverage \u2026 Should you apply your foundation with a straw? Unsurprisingly, the answer is a resounding no. However, what changed the way I apply my foundation and concealer is using the \u201cpatchwork\u201d method, which is how professional makeup artists such as Lisa Eldridge, who coined the term, apply it. Instead of slathering foundation all over your face, which can look dry and cakey, use your base products with a small brush in the smallest amounts and only apply to parts of the face you think need it. Leave the rest of your skin natural, and blend until the patchwork of real skin and made-up skin is seamless. Whenever I\u2019ve done this I can see I look measurably fresher in both photos and in the mirror \u2013 although it can take a little longer than the \u201cslather and go\u201d method. \u2026 and how to keep it off your clothes Make sure you spray your clothes with hairspray to protect them from makeup transfer. I was elated when I discovered this hack. Don\u2019t be swayed by others\u2019 opinions of you Makeup is an incredible way to express yourself. That\u2019s why I also rate the idea of \u201cunapproachable makeup\u201d, from the TikTokers using bold makeup as a \u201cman repellant\u201d to subvert the traditional notion of pretty makeup, aimed at the male gaze. I do believe that makeup should be expressive and feel joyful rather than used to cover up or hide. But if a bold look repels anyone, of any gender, because they\u2019re judgmental about your appearance, then that\u2019s an added bonus. The eye-makeup trick that gives Sophia Loren glamour One of the hacks I\u2019m still enamoured with is the \u201csiren eyes\u201d, TikTok\u2019s take on the ever-popular winged eyeliner look. Instead of a clean flicked-out wing, doing your liner with an eyeshadow or pencil to create a gentle elongated line looks softer and is far easier. I use an Est\u00e9e Lauder Waterproof Gel Eye Pencil (\u00a317.95), and then flick the edges out using a good eyeliner brush such as Bobbi Brown\u2019s Ultra Precise Eyeliner Brush (\u00a329) before the liner sets. The hack I share most in real life If you struggle with strong-smelling sweat and body odour, using Acnecide, an antibacterial face wash (\u00a310.99), in the shower kills any bacteria under the arms that causes our usually odourless sweat to smell grim. Reframe your routine According to TikTok, we should all be having an \u201ceverything shower\u201d, a weekly slot to blitz everything in one go: optional hair removal, exfoliation and a face mask etc. I\u2019ve always done this on Monday evenings as a regular routine, but giving it a name is fun \u2013 certainly better than the depressing \u201cbeauty admin hour\u201d, which is what I had it down in my diary as previously. LED masks: my verdict I receive a lot of questions about LED face masks, probably because they\u2019re an investment buy. I\u2019ve certainly seen a difference since using one regularly; they help soothe my eczema, and I like the fact you can multitask while wearing one. Current Body has an LED mask (\u00a3482) that covers your face, neck and chest, which is excellent, but Beauty Pro has a good basic model that\u2019s cheaper (\u00a3195). When to splurge \u2026 My thoughts are that you should spend money on treatments, such as massages, facials, and hair and nail sessions, to ensure you get a good standard of treatment and that the people doing this for you are treated well and compensated. If the workers seem to fear their employer and seem anxious or distressed \u2013 if they\u2019re not allowed to talk to each other, and/or if tips are communal \u2013 that could be a sign you need to investigate the establishment, and potentially contact the police. When it comes to aesthetic procedures, you get what you pay for in terms of safety, expertise and the ability to fix any complications. But whatever clinic you choose, if you\u2019re upsold or made to feel uncomfortable or bad about your appearance in any way, that\u2019s a massive red flag. \u2026 and when to budget Everything else \u2013 makeup, skincare, fragrance \u2013 is available at price points to suit everyone. A few cheap but excellent products I rate are Beauty Bay\u2019s eyeshadow palettes (\u00a315.00) in a huge range of shades; Maybelline\u2019s Sky High Mascara (\u00a312.95); and e.l.f.\u2019s Halo Glow Liquid Filter (\u00a315) for a brilliant skin tint and glow booster. Anyone with dry skin should use CeraVe Moisturising Cream (\u00a313.60); the ceramides soothe and repair the skin\u2019s barrier function. Get the curl without the heat As a vintage-beauty obsessive, I\u2019ve long been a fan of heatless ways to curl the hair, as people did in the past. But instead of pin curls and sleep rollers, socks and bathrobe belts have taken over TikTok as ways to create curls as you sleep. Those two methods didn\u2019t work that well for me, but I do get a nice wave from Silke\u2019s heatless curler kit (\u00a342), which I\u2019ve even seen people wearing on planes. The hack that works on stray hairs Another hack that\u2019s worth a shot is using tumble-dryer sheets or dental floss as a hair smoother. They\u2019re coated in wax/conditioner, which flattens stray hairs. Viral got2b\u2019s Brow and Edges Gel (\u00a35.50) is good for slicking down baby hairs. The best way to go nail gel-free I\u2019m giving my nails a rest after years of gel-polish removal has left them weak. If you\u2019re in the same boat, use CND Rescue RX (\u00a325.95) to strengthen them, then nail oil to maintain. L\u2019Occitane\u2019s Shea Nail and Cuticle Nourishing Oil (\u00a315.50) will slip into a handbag, and there\u2019s also lots of joy in Dior\u2019s Cr\u00e8me Abricot Strengthening Nail Care (\u00a329). I stick to easy-to-wear shades like Nails Inc Glowing Out polish (\u00a39) that enhances the natural colour. How to perfume on the cheap As a scent fiend, my biggest takeaway is that a \u201cdupe\u201d generally doesn\u2019t have the same effect as the original scent. So, if you like a certain fragrance, my money-saving hack is to see if there\u2019s a body mist or hair perfume version. These cost less but it\u2019s the same scent, just in a less potent guise. For example, Chanel\u2019s Coco Mademoiselle as a perfume is \u00a3122 for 100ml, but the body mist is \u00a346 for 100ml. And if you use moisturiser or a little petroleum jelly under the scent, it\u2019ll stay on the skin for longer by evaporating more slowly.

      "body": "<p>A recent <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39431909/\">study</a> has revealed that some people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) cope best during periods of high stress.</p> <p>Maggie Sibley, a clinical psychologist and psychiatry professor at the University of Washington and the study\u2019s lead author, initially set out to learn whether it is possible for adults to recover from ADHD. In an earlier study, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34384227/\">published in 2022</a>, she investigated a National Institute of Mental Health data set that tracked 600 patients with ADHD over 16 years, starting from childhood.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we found was this pattern of fluctuating ADHD, and most of the people that were getting better, they would then get back to ADHD again,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/16/a-diagnosis-can-sweep-away-guilt-the-delicate-art-of-treating-adhd\">\u2018A diagnosis can sweep away guilt\u2019: the delicate art of treating ADHD</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the more recent study, published last week in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, she went back to that same data set to try and figure out what circumstances might lead to relief from ADHD symptoms.</p> <p>Sibley thought that ADHD patients would experience the most relief during periods of low stress. What she found was more counterintuitive.</p> <p>Her study identified three different groups of ADHD patients: those who experienced periods of apparent full recovery, those who experienced partial remission, and those whose ADHD symptoms remained steady over time.</p> <p>People who experienced temporary full recovery were most likely to experience it during times of \u201chigh environmental demand\u201d, or, put more simply, stress. Those who had periods of partial recovery were also more likely to have comorbid anxiety.</p> <p>Arij Alarachi, a psychology phD student at McMaster University who has researched ADHD and anxiety with St Joseph\u2019s hospital in Hamilton, Canada, says it makes sense that ADHD would respond differently to different circumstances.</p> <p>ADHD brains might not change that much, said Alarachi, but people can adapt their circumstances to better cope with their ADHD. As Sibley\u2019s study shows, though, even among people with ADHD, those strategies might look different, since \u201cADHD comes in a lot of different shapes and sizes,\u201d Alarachi added.</p> <p>\u201cADHD patients may do best when they have to rise to the occasion. And we see that on the micro level \u2026 deadlines [could feel] helpful, or when things are more urgent, you\u2019re able to be your most productive and hyperfocus,\u201d said Sibley.</p> <p>Although it\u2019s impossible to completely untangle how much this is a result of ADHD patients choosing to take on more stress when their symptoms are in check.</p> <p>Sara Vranes, who was diagnosed with ADHD at 36, relates to this idea. She said she sees her ability to hyperfocus under pressure as a \u201csuperpower\u201d. Vranes now works with homeless communities, but had 15 years of experience as a midwife and doula before that, and she says she was most calm in crisis.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to be hurt, but I was able to handle it because my brain just can hyperfocus. I could see everything clearly and see a process in my mind, and act on it in real time.\u201d During downtime, however, she\u2019s often anxious and can\u2019t focus.</p> <p>More than half of adults with ADHD <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165178122000373\">also experience anxiety.</a> But, Sibley\u2019s study shows this might not always be a bad thing.</p> <p>\u201cWe call it a protective factor in ADHD,\u201d she said, explaining that multiple studies have found that children <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275896526_Managing_Anxiety_in_Children_With_ADHD_Using_Cognitive-Behavioral_Therapy_A_Pilot_Randomized_Controlled_Trial\">with ADHD and anxiety</a> respond better to behavioral treatment, like cognitive behavioral therapy, <a href=\"https://www.scielo.br/j/prc/a/8RGx4kwqy6YSGGYMrmVs79H/?lang=en\">than children who just have ADHD</a>.</p> <p>Alarachi said that in her research, too, she\u2019s come across people with ADHD who say anxiety helps them keep impulsivity in check. They will say: \u201cMy anxiety [has] kind of helped me stop myself from maybe acting on some of those impulses, or it\u2019s kind of made me think about some of the consequences.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThink about it like the gas and the brakes in a car, right? The ADHD might be the gas, and then the anxiety is putting the brakes on, like getting people to inhibit a little bit,\u201d said Sibley.</p> <p>Anxiety and impulsivity might be more extreme in people with ADHD, \u201cbut somehow they\u2019re canceling each other out in a way that kind of makes neither of those processes as problematic as they might be on their own, which is kind of an interesting concept\u201d, Sibley added.</p> <p>Alarachi and Sibley agree that people with ADHD should look within to figure out how best to relax and keep their anxiety to a reasonable level where it\u2019s useful. Vranes has a hard time just relaxing in front of the TV, but says playing phone games and watching TV at the same time can help stop her mind from wandering.</p> <p>Sibley has encountered ADHD patients who are most relaxed while exercising and socializing.</p> <p>\u201cI always tell people with ADHD, you have to learn to write your own owner\u2019s manual,\u201d Sibley said. \u201cSo you have to figure out, what is your brand of relaxation? What is your brand of decompressing?\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A recent study has revealed that some people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) cope best during periods of high stress. Maggie Sibley, a clinical psychologist and psychiatry professor at the University of Washington and the study\u2019s lead author, initially set out to learn whether it is possible for adults to recover from ADHD. In an earlier study, published in 2022, she investigated a National Institute of Mental Health data set that tracked 600 patients with ADHD over 16 years, starting from childhood. \u201cWhat we found was this pattern of fluctuating ADHD, and most of the people that were getting better, they would then get back to ADHD again,\u201d she said. For the more recent study, published last week in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, she went back to that same data set to try and figure out what circumstances might lead to relief from ADHD symptoms. Sibley thought that ADHD patients would experience the most relief during periods of low stress. What she found was more counterintuitive. Her study identified three different groups of ADHD patients: those who experienced periods of apparent full recovery, those who experienced partial remission, and those whose ADHD symptoms remained steady over time. People who experienced temporary full recovery were most likely to experience it during times of \u201chigh environmental demand\u201d, or, put more simply, stress. Those who had periods of partial recovery were also more likely to have comorbid anxiety. Arij Alarachi, a psychology phD student at McMaster University who has researched ADHD and anxiety with St Joseph\u2019s hospital in Hamilton, Canada, says it makes sense that ADHD would respond differently to different circumstances. ADHD brains might not change that much, said Alarachi, but people can adapt their circumstances to better cope with their ADHD. As Sibley\u2019s study shows, though, even among people with ADHD, those strategies might look different, since \u201cADHD comes in a lot of different shapes and sizes,\u201d Alarachi added. \u201cADHD patients may do best when they have to rise to the occasion. And we see that on the micro level \u2026 deadlines [could feel] helpful, or when things are more urgent, you\u2019re able to be your most productive and hyperfocus,\u201d said Sibley. Although it\u2019s impossible to completely untangle how much this is a result of ADHD patients choosing to take on more stress when their symptoms are in check. Sara Vranes, who was diagnosed with ADHD at 36, relates to this idea. She said she sees her ability to hyperfocus under pressure as a \u201csuperpower\u201d. Vranes now works with homeless communities, but had 15 years of experience as a midwife and doula before that, and she says she was most calm in crisis. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to be hurt, but I was able to handle it because my brain just can hyperfocus. I could see everything clearly and see a process in my mind, and act on it in real time.\u201d During downtime, however, she\u2019s often anxious and can\u2019t focus. More than half of adults with ADHD also experience anxiety. But, Sibley\u2019s study shows this might not always be a bad thing. \u201cWe call it a protective factor in ADHD,\u201d she said, explaining that multiple studies have found that children with ADHD and anxiety respond better to behavioral treatment, like cognitive behavioral therapy, than children who just have ADHD. Alarachi said that in her research, too, she\u2019s come across people with ADHD who say anxiety helps them keep impulsivity in check. They will say: \u201cMy anxiety [has] kind of helped me stop myself from maybe acting on some of those impulses, or it\u2019s kind of made me think about some of the consequences.\u201d \u201cThink about it like the gas and the brakes in a car, right? The ADHD might be the gas, and then the anxiety is putting the brakes on, like getting people to inhibit a little bit,\u201d said Sibley. Anxiety and impulsivity might be more extreme in people with ADHD, \u201cbut somehow they\u2019re canceling each other out in a way that kind of makes neither of those processes as problematic as they might be on their own, which is kind of an interesting concept\u201d, Sibley added. Alarachi and Sibley agree that people with ADHD should look within to figure out how best to relax and keep their anxiety to a reasonable level where it\u2019s useful. Vranes has a hard time just relaxing in front of the TV, but says playing phone games and watching TV at the same time can help stop her mind from wandering. Sibley has encountered ADHD patients who are most relaxed while exercising and socializing. \u201cI always tell people with ADHD, you have to learn to write your own owner\u2019s manual,\u201d Sibley said. \u201cSo you have to figure out, what is your brand of relaxation? What is your brand of decompressing?\u201d",

One day, the conversation turned to children\u2019s films and superhero movies. Why, Schubert wondered, did he cry at their endings?</p> <p>After some thought and discussion, the researchers began to suspect that this immediate, involuntary reaction reflected an emotion that hadn\u2019t been studied scientifically. \u201cAll psychologists assumed that crying meant sadness,\u201d says Fiske, yet the tears that Schubert was describing <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29342799/\">occurred during positive events</a>. In a superhero film, for instance, you are less likely to cry when the superhero is crushed and defeated than when his friends come to save him \u2013 a moment of hope. \u201cWe were just so intrigued by this emotion that we started studying it,\u201d says Fiske, who is based at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p> <p>Their first challenge was to gather as much information as possible on people\u2019s experiences of the emotion and when they experienced it, through in-depth interviews, experiments and ethnographic observations.

Kama muta, the researchers argued, is a brief and positive (or bittersweet) feeling that is often described with metaphors depicting motion such as being \u201cmoved\u201d or \u201cstirred\u201d. It is accompanied by a warmth in the chest, goosebumps on the skin, chills down the neck and tears in the eyes, and occurs during the sudden intensification of \u201ccommunal sharing relationships\u201d \u2013 with friends, family, lovers or members of the same community.</p> <p>The triggers may vary widely. \u201cThe classic example that we use is that you have this old friend whom you haven\u2019t seen in ages, and then you suddenly reunite,\u201d says <a href=\"https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/jz%40mgmt.au.dk\">Janis Zickfeld</a>, an assistant professor at Aarhus University and co-author with Schubert, Seibt and Fiske. But there are <a href=\"https://kamamutalab.org/about/\">many other prompts</a>. It could be your elderly neighbour making you soup when you are ill. You might hear a poet describe hardships that you have experienced. Or you may be at a commemoration for military heroes and the sacrifices they have made for you and your country. In each case, the goosebumps and tears arise from the enhanced connection that you are either witnessing or experiencing for yourself.</p> <p>Kama muta enhances our commitment to our relationships and encourages us to act with greater compassion and kindness, both towards the person or people that have provoked the feeling, and more generally. \u201cIt helps you appreciate the relationships that you have,\u201d says Fiske. \u201cThe feeling may last only 30 seconds or a minute, but the motivation endures.\u201d It\u2019s the reason, he says, that we might feel like hugging a stranger at a concert; kama muta may lie behind Swifties\u2019 habit of handing out friendship bracelets to other fans.</p> <p>Fiske has found that descriptions of kama muta feel instantly familiar to most people, even though they have never heard the term or definition before. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite eye-opening to realise that people have emotions that they don\u2019t know they have,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never given a talk about this where people have said: \u2018I don\u2019t recognise what you\u2019re talking about.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>By 2018, Fiske and his colleagues had completed <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29888936/\">an enormous survey</a> of kama muta across 19 countries \u2013 including the US and UK, Germany, Portugal, India, China and Japan. In some cases, the researchers asked people to recall an episode in their life that had triggered \u201cpositive tears\u201d. In others, the team showed participants various videos depicting some kind of relationship intensification, such as a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH-Bm7V6_Vg&amp;list=PLc8nlHQh9a0EfZZx--UHug1n04Q3SyhOM&amp;index=3\">montage clip of a couple kissing</a>, from young adulthood to old age. Participants then had to fill in a detailed questionnaire about the experience.</p> <p>Sure enough, after these prompts, the participants were far more likely to report feeling the different elements of kama muta described above, compared with when they were encouraged to contemplate sad, amusing or awe-filled events \u2013 confirmation that the team had hit upon a viable psychological construct that sits apart from those better-known emotions.</p>    <p>The fact that kama muta was recognisable in every country should not be surprising: caring relationships are a basic human need and so it is natural that we have evolved an emotion that motivates us to maintain them. When people felt kama muta, they were more likely to agree with statements such as: \u201cI felt like telling someone how much I care about them\u201d; \u201cI wanted to hug someone\u201d; or \u201cI wanted to do something extra-nice for someone\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/psyp.13662\">Zickfeld\u2019s later research</a> found that participants\u2019 skin temperature around the chest rose slightly after watching videos that evoked kama muta, suggesting that the clips were almost literally \u201cheartwarming\u201d. Interestingly, however, the participants\u2019 heart rates and breathing rates tended to drop after feeling the emotion. \u201cIt could be something that soothes your body,\u201d Zickfeld says. \u201cYou have a [momentary] increase in arousal and then the feeling brings it down again to the baseline.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One experiment found that evoking kama muta tended to improve Republicans\u2019 views of Democrats and vice versa</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.26613/esic.1.1.12/html\">Storytellers across time</a> have evoked kama muta to captivate audiences. Fiske believes that we can trace it back to Odysseus\u2019s return home to Ithaca after 20 years of turmoil, and his ultimate reunion with his wife. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from the text that they feel this emotion,\u201d he says. Today, many people report experiencing it when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KUBX5GwV3M\">Wall-E reunites with Eve</a> in the 2008 romantic science fiction film.</p> <p>Kama muta is also evident in countless viral clips. Cute cat videos are just one iteration, as their vulnerability triggers our parental instincts. A study by <a href=\"https://www.oslomet.no/en/about/employee/kamillak/\">Kamilla Knutsen Steinnes</a> at Oslo Metropolitan University <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00387/full\">found that the kittens\u2019 cuteness</a> is directly correlated with the intensity of the kama muta that participants experience. \u201cYou fall in love with the kitten,\u201d Fiske says. \u201cYouTube is this vehicle for kama muta. People are posting these videos because they enjoy experiencing this emotion, and the people watching them then want to share it.\u201d His personal favourite is a commercial for Extra Gum, called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwWEw4w7Ivs\">The Story of Sarah and Juan</a>, about a high-school couple. \u201cKama muta is all over marketing,\u201d Fiske says.</p> <p>Mental health professionals have started to take notice of the emotion\u2019s potential to heal the psyche. Krystina Alessandrini, a lecturer at the Integrative Institute of Counselling and Psychotherapy, Dublin, says that very small human gestures \u2013 such as making the client a cup of tea, or a walk outside together \u2013 can inordinately influence people\u2019s responses to therapy. \u201cThe clients feel moved by these moments of connection,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd they really seem to make a difference to them in their healing processes.\u201d Her <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/capr.12713\">interviews with other therapists</a> about their experiences with clients, and their own experiences in therapy, suggest that kama muta may lie behind this. \u201cIt often had this kind of motivational effect\u2026 It made people want to connect to others in the same way that their therapist had connected with them.\u201d</p>    <p>Other researchers have been interested in the ways that certain rituals can evoke kama muta in large groups. Zabala recently investigated <a href=\"https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjso.12723\">people\u2019s experiences of the Korrika festival</a>, which involves an uninterrupted relay race across the historical territory of the Basque Country. The baton contains a message, written in Euskara<em>, </em>the Basque language,<em> </em>and the race is often accompanied by music and speeches<em>. </em>\u201cIt<em> </em>symbolises the legacy of Euskara \u2013 that Euskara does not stop, and does not disappear as long as there are speakers who practise it.\u201d As you might expect, the communal experience strengthens people\u2019s feelings of shared identity with other Euskara speakers \u2013 and this is mediated by the kama muta felt during the ceremony.</p> <p>Politicians may use this to their advantage, with studies finding that <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2018.1441128\">Democrat and Republican campaign adverts</a> in the 2016 presidential election prompted kama muta among their supporters \u2013 and increased their intention to vote. With the right messaging, however, the emotion may help to heal political divides. <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/13684302211067152\">One recent experiment</a> found that evoking kama muta tended to improve Republicans\u2019 views of Democrats and vice versa. The videos did not need to be overtly political; the romantic Sarah and Juan clip from the chewing gum commercial helped people to feel more trust in their political rivals. The greatest effects, however, were roused by videos that combined kama muta with a sense of national pride \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlHMQEegpFs\">Ray Charles\u2019s performance of America the Beautiful</a> before the baseball World Series, a few weeks after 9/11.</p> <p>More than a decade after his first conversations on the topic, Fiske now considers himself to be a \u201cconnoisseur\u201d of the emotion in all its flavours. \u201cI put myself in the way of it and I stop to notice when I have it,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the lovely things about discovering this emotion is that you can savour it\u2026 When you feel it, you realise that you\u2019re a loving person, and that other people love you.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>David Robson is the author of <em>The Laws of Connection: 13 Social Strategies That Will Transform Your Life</em>, published by Canongate (\u00a318.99).

Zickfeld\u2019s later research found that participants\u2019 skin temperature around the chest rose slightly after watching videos that evoked kama muta, suggesting that the clips were almost literally \u201cheartwarming\u201d. Interestingly, however, the participants\u2019 heart rates and breathing rates tended to drop after feeling the emotion. \u201cIt could be something that soothes your body,\u201d Zickfeld says. \u201cYou have a [momentary] increase in arousal and then the feeling brings it down again to the baseline.\u201d Storytellers across time have evoked kama muta to captivate audiences. Fiske believes that we can trace it back to Odysseus\u2019s return home to Ithaca after 20 years of turmoil, and his ultimate reunion with his wife. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from the text that they feel this emotion,\u201d he says. Today, many people report experiencing it when Wall-E reunites with Eve in the 2008 romantic science fiction film. Kama muta is also evident in countless viral clips. Cute cat videos are just one iteration, as their vulnerability triggers our parental instincts. A study by Kamilla Knutsen Steinnes at Oslo Metropolitan University found that the kittens\u2019 cuteness is directly correlated with the intensity of the kama muta that participants experience. \u201cYou fall in love with the kitten,\u201d Fiske says. \u201cYouTube is this vehicle for kama muta. People are posting these videos because they enjoy experiencing this emotion, and the people watching them then want to share it.\u201d His personal favourite is a commercial for Extra Gum, called The Story of Sarah and Juan, about a high-school couple. \u201cKama muta is all over marketing,\u201d Fiske says. Mental health professionals have started to take notice of the emotion\u2019s potential to heal the psyche. Krystina Alessandrini, a lecturer at the Integrative Institute of Counselling and Psychotherapy, Dublin, says that very small human gestures \u2013 such as making the client a cup of tea, or a walk outside together \u2013 can inordinately influence people\u2019s responses to therapy. \u201cThe clients feel moved by these moments of connection,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd they really seem to make a difference to them in their healing processes.\u201d Her interviews with other therapists about their experiences with clients, and their own experiences in therapy, suggest that kama muta may lie behind this. \u201cIt often had this kind of motivational effect\u2026 It made people want to connect to others in the same way that their therapist had connected with them.\u201d Other researchers have been interested in the ways that certain rituals can evoke kama muta in large groups. Zabala recently investigated people\u2019s experiences of the Korrika festival, which involves an uninterrupted relay race across the historical territory of the Basque Country. The baton contains a message, written in Euskara, the Basque language, and the race is often accompanied by music and speeches. \u201cIt symbolises the legacy of Euskara \u2013 that Euskara does not stop, and does not disappear as long as there are speakers who practise it.\u201d As you might expect, the communal experience strengthens people\u2019s feelings of shared identity with other Euskara speakers \u2013 and this is mediated by the kama muta felt during the ceremony. Politicians may use this to their advantage, with studies finding that Democrat and Republican campaign adverts in the 2016 presidential election prompted kama muta among their supporters \u2013 and increased their intention to vote. With the right messaging, however, the emotion may help to heal political divides. One recent experiment found that evoking kama muta tended to improve Republicans\u2019 views of Democrats and vice versa. The videos did not need to be overtly political; the romantic Sarah and Juan clip from the chewing gum commercial helped people to feel more trust in their political rivals. The greatest effects, however, were roused by videos that combined kama muta with a sense of national pride \u2013 such as Ray Charles\u2019s performance of America the Beautiful before the baseball World Series, a few weeks after 9/11. More than a decade after his first conversations on the topic, Fiske now considers himself to be a \u201cconnoisseur\u201d of the emotion in all its flavours. \u201cI put myself in the way of it and I stop to notice when I have it,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the lovely things about discovering this emotion is that you can savour it\u2026 When you feel it, you realise that you\u2019re a loving person, and that other people love you.\u201d David Robson is the author of The Laws of Connection: 13 Social Strategies That Will Transform Your Life, published by Canongate (\u00a318.99).

You get a whole sequence of black, Kushite pharaohs.\u201d</p> <p>Rynn works primarily with international police, helping to identify bodies, producing a likeness from a skull so friends and family might recognise the individuals. He said: \u201cThe face on the sarcophagus is totally different \u2013 a long face with a long narrow nose. I looked into how unusual it is that the sarcophagus did not look like its inhabitant. It was quite common. But, on the inside of the lid, there\u2019s a painting of a woman with much darker skin.\u201d</p> <p>In Rynn\u2019s portrayal, the woman is bald. He said: \u201cAll the priestesses and priests would have shaved every hair off the body because they were embalming dead bodies. It was both ceremonial and a hygiene thing.

The chokehold lasted at least 5 minutes.</p> <p>Neely\u2019s death sparked immediate protests. On the subway platform at Broadway-Lafayette, where EMTs had attempted to revive Neely, a support column had been daubed with \u201cWho killed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jordan-neely\">Jordan Neely</a>?\u201d</p> <p>Tensions soon turned into hostility toward New York\u2019s policy for the unhoused and transit authority police.</p> <p>\u201cThis was a horrible lynching \u2013 the murder of someone needing help,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/03/jordan-neely-death-new-york-city-subway\">student Shifa Rahman told the Guardian last year.</a> \u201cHe was at a point of desperation and a citizen, acting in racial bias, acted to suppress that.\u201d</p> <p>Penny told police that Neely was ranting in an \u201cinsanely threatening\u201d way, shouting \u201cI\u2019m gonna\u2019 kill you\u201d and saying he was \u201cready to die\u201d or go to jail for life before he placed him in the chokehold.</p> <p>Witnesses on the subway car have offered differing accounts of what took place.

      "bodyText": "New York City central criminal courthouse braced this week for the start of a trial that will shed light on and perhaps assign accountability for the death of a 30-year-old unhoused Black man. Was Daniel Penny, the 24-year-old former US Marine accused of causing the death of Jordan Neely, an unhoused former Michael Jackson impersonator, acting recklessly when he placed Neely in a chokehold allegedly for more than six minutes on the subway last May? Along the way, the case will also be a referendum on the safety of the city\u2019s transit system, the effectiveness of its mental health services, and where limits on citizen interventions in situations where they may perceive themselves or others to be under physical threat may lie. Last week, as more than 100 potential jurors were being screened ahead of opening arguments, Judge Maxwell Wiley granted a request by prosecutors to conceal the identity of the jury, acknowledging that \u201cthreats\u201d had been made to all parties in the case. \u201cI believe that\u2019s wise,\u201d Wiley said. \u201cThere\u2019s not just opinions, but very, very strong opinions. There\u2019s been people who have not been afraid to make threats.\u201d Wiley asked potential jurors if they had heard of the case. Nearly everyone raised their hand. \u201cNot a surprise,\u201d the judge remarked. Penny, who has pleaded not guilty to second-degree manslaughter and negligent homicide, told investigators that Neely, who suffered from schizophrenia, threatened to kill other passengers and was merely was trying to hold Neely down until help arrived. The chokehold lasted at least 5 minutes. Neely\u2019s death sparked immediate protests. On the subway platform at Broadway-Lafayette, where EMTs had attempted to revive Neely, a support column had been daubed with \u201cWho killed Jordan Neely?\u201d Tensions soon turned into hostility toward New York\u2019s policy for the unhoused and transit authority police. \u201cThis was a horrible lynching \u2013 the murder of someone needing help,\u201d student Shifa Rahman told the Guardian last year. \u201cHe was at a point of desperation and a citizen, acting in racial bias, acted to suppress that.\u201d Penny told police that Neely was ranting in an \u201cinsanely threatening\u201d way, shouting \u201cI\u2019m gonna\u2019 kill you\u201d and saying he was \u201cready to die\u201d or go to jail for life before he placed him in the chokehold. Witnesses on the subway car have offered differing accounts of what took place. One said Neely had been acting aggressively and frightening people but hadn\u2019t attacked anyone. Other witnesses claim Neely was not threatening. \u201cJordan Neely did not attempt to physically injure anybody on that train so the question is whether a majority of white people on a jury are going to let another white guy kill a Black man in the middle of Manhattan because the man is scary,\u201d says veteran New York criminal defense attorney Ron Kuby. \u201cHistorically, the answer to that has been, sure,\u201d he adds. \u201cSo we\u2019ll see whether things have changed \u2026 \u201d Penny was not charged for nearly two weeks, sparking further protests across the city. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of the manslaughter charge. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to kill the guy,\u201d Penny told investigators, according to court papers, and said he was \u201cnot a confrontational guy\u201d. Outside Manhattan criminal court, Penny was greeted with shouts of \u201cmurderer!\u201d by social justice protestors, some held signs that read \u201cJustice for Jordan Neely: End Racist Vigilantism Now!\u201d Neely\u2019s family and supporters have said he was simply crying out for help. They say his mental health had deteriorated after his mother\u2019s body was found stuffed in a suitcase in the Bronx. Neely\u2019s aunt, Carolyn Neely, later said her nephew became a \u201ccomplete mess\u201d, noting he was schizophrenic and suffered from both PTSD and depression. \u201cThe whole system just failed him. He fell through the cracks of the system,\u201d she told the New York Post. City authorities had placed Neely, who was on the psychosis-inducing synthetic marijuana K2, according to an autopsy report, was on a list informally known as \u201cthe Top 50\u201d of people known for the severity of their mental health troubles and resistance to accepting help. \u201cJordan Neely\u2019s life mattered,\u201d New York mayor Eric Adams said before Penny was charged. \u201cHe was suffering from severe mental illness. That was not the cause of his death. His death is a tragedy that never should have happened.\u201d Other New York political figures, among them progressive council member Chi Osse, have pointed to a failure of mental health services and disparities in the way that Penny was arrested and released, and the way a Black man might have been treated if the situation was reversed. Penny\u2019s defense fund has raised more than $3m via a pledge drive that describes the criminal charges as \u201cstemming from him protecting individuals on a NYC subway train\u201d. Tensions around the case seep deep into issues confronting New Yorkers that have played into difficulties even selecting a jury to hear the case and what may be admitted into evidence. Last week, prosecutors reportedly asked the judge in the case to bar witnesses from calling Penny a \u201chero\u201d or \u201cgood Samaritan\u201d. According to an email exchange between lawyers obtained by Gothamist, assistant district attorney Dafna Yoran said the use of those terms was subjective and \u201cthe equivalent of a determination that the [defendant] was justified\u201d. But defense lawyer Thomas Kenniff countered that witnesses used those words soon after the incident. \u201cIt describes what they perceived, Neely acting as the aggressor, and Mr Penny acting to defend and protect,\u201d he wrote. The trial is expected to last six weeks.",

A large, long fence surrounds much of the complex, part of which is being demolished to be replaced with a museum and a memorial to the victims of the attack. But as Pittsburgh\u2019s Jewish community prepared to mark the sixth anniversary of the day that a shooter opened fire in the synagogue during Shabbat services, fear of rising antisemitism in Pennsylvania and across the US has increased rather than dissipated in the years since the attack. In a battleground state such as Pennsylvania, Jewish voters \u2013 traditionally a cohort the Democratic party can rely on \u2013 are considering who might best address their concerns going to the polls in next month\u2019s presidential election. Pennsylvania is home to about 300,000 Jews of voting age, according to the American Jewish Population Project, the largest number in any of the seven battleground states. As with Arab Americans, who polls suggest are deserting the Democrats this year, Donald Trump and his backers see an opportunity in Pennsylvania\u2019s Jewish community. The Republican Jewish Coalition is spending $15m on TV ads featuring Jewish voters in battleground states that portray the Democratic presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, as being out of step with Israel\u2019s security concerns. \u201cThat is the largest [amount] ever by any Jewish group targeting Jewish voters in an election,\u201d says Sam Markstein, the RJC\u2019s national political director. \u201cJewish Americans make up roughly 2% of the [US] population but we are subjected to roughly 60% of all religious hate crimes last year.

They have been visible in the pro-Palestinian movement that has spread in the last year. \u201cThe Jewish population is a relatively small portion of the state\u2019s voters so it\u2019s often hard to pinpoint their behaviors \u2026 but it\u2019s no surprise that when we\u2019re talking about cleavages [it\u2019s] issues related to Israel and the war,\u201d says Berwood Yost, director for the Center of Opinion Research at Franklin &amp; Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Yost says that Lee, who has outraised her Republican challenger, James Hayes, by millions of dollars, is unlikely to lose despite reservations from some Jewish voters. \u201cBut you never know because the election environment is so bad for Democrats right now. But it would be a surprise.\u201d He added that in a recent poll of Pennsylvanians, those who said foreign affairs and Israel were a major concern were split in their support for Trump and Harris, highlighting the tightness of the race in in the state. But despite advances by Trump and his backers, Jewish voters across all swing states are still expected to back Harris \u2013 even if some see her as the lesser of two bad candidates. For Ella-Gabriel Mason, a Philadelphia-based massage therapist and choreographer who is Jewish, casting her early vote for Harris was \u201ca little bit of a harm-reduction vote\u201d. \u201cI really want to see an end to the US arming Israel and unfortunately neither candidate is going to provide that right now,\u201d they say. \u201cI find the way that [Trump] talks about Israel and antisemitism incredibly infuriating because it\u2019s really the way that he\u2019s supported and emboldened white supremacist violence.\u201d Two years ago, Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, visited the Tree of Life Synagogue. Harris has played a role in establishing the first National Strategy to Combat Antisemitism, a Biden administration project founded last year. She has also refused to break from Joe Biden on his full-throated support for Israel, angering Arab Americans whose votes could also prove decisive. Trump, meanwhile, has been criticized for suggesting last month that Jewish people would share a significant amount of blame if he loses the election, and that Jews who vote for Democrats \u201chate Israel\u201d. Markstein, however, sought to play down some of Trump\u2019s comments and doesn\u2019t see them as a warning or threat from the former president. \u201cAll he was saying is the inverse of what we\u2019ve been saying \u2013 that the Jewish community is going to play a key voting role,\u201d he says. Busis, the newspaper publisher, agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to suddenly see it go 50-50 but it could swing a little bit more towards the Trump side, and in a very close election in a swing state that could tip the balance nationally.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 28 October 2024. A previous version incorrectly attributed a quote made by Sam Markstein to Jim Busis.",

      "body": "<p>There is little doubt that Donald Trump will refuse to accept a defeat in November\u2019s US presidential election.</p> <p>The former president, who is deadlocked in the polls with Kamala Harris, has spent months priming his supporters to believe the only way he could lose is through fraud. \u201cIf I lose \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you what, it\u2019s possible. Because they cheat. That\u2019s the only way we\u2019re gonna lose, because they cheat,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/30/politics/fact-check-trump-election-lies-2024/index.html\">he said</a> at a rally in September.</p> <p>He has refused to say, several times, that he will unequivocally accept the results of the election, only going as far to say that he will <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/live-blog/presidential-debate-trump-biden-live-updates-rcna157191\">if \u201cit\u2019s fair and legal and good\u201d</a>. Having escaped any accountability for the attack on the Capitol on January 6, he has embraced those who violently attacked the US government to protest against the 2020 election results, calling it a <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-january-6-univision-town-hall/\">\u201cday of love\u201d</a>.</p> <p>JD Vance, his running mate, has, at times, been even more forthright. The Ohio senator has said he would not have certified the 2020 race. During the vice-presidential debate in early October, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/01/walz-vance-debate-2020-election\">he refused to say</a> that Trump lost the 2020 election. He<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/17/jd-vance-trump-2020-election-lost\"> later said, more definitively</a>, that he did not believe Trump lost four years ago.</p> <p>But this year the Trump ticket\u2019s efforts to pre-emptively deny the results in case of a loss of the election go beyond rhetoric. They are now backed up by widespread party support and a highly organized, massive legal apparatus.</p> <p>\u201cThe effort to try to subvert the outcome is more thought-out, more strategic, more organized, more coordinated than in 2020,\u201d said Sean Morales-Doyle, director of the voting rights program at the Brennan Center for Justice.</p> <p>Republicans are primed to support Trump\u2019s efforts. Nearly one in five Republican voters believe Trump should declare the election result invalid if he loses, according to a recent <a href=\"https://www.prri.org/press-release/survey-one-in-four-republican-trump-supporters-say-that-if-trump-loses-the-election-he-should-declare-results-invalid-and-do-whatever-it-takes-to-assume-office/\">survey by the Public Religion Research Institute</a> (12% of Democrats said Harris, who has committed to accepting the election results, should do the same).</p> <p>Dozens of people who have challenged the results of the last presidential election are in local offices where they have power over certifying vote totals. Led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jul/02/cleta-mitchell-republican-election-denial\">Cleta Mitchell</a>, a Trump ally who aided his efforts to overturn the election four years ago, Republicans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/31/far-right-groups-non-citizen-voting-misinformation\">have organized</a> a massive effort to monitor election offices, challenge voters, and work in election precincts.</p> <p>At least 35 officials who have refused to certify elections since 2020 will have a role over certifying the vote this fall, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25252051-electioncertificationunderthreat-2-1\">according to a report</a> by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), a watchdog group.</p> <p>The Republican National Committee has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/16/republican-litigation-election\">spent months filing frivolous lawsuits</a> that contain specious allegations of fraud. Legal experts say Republicans have no chance of winning the suits ahead of the election \u2013 many have already been thrown out of court \u2013 but they are instead designed to generate headlines and create the impression that something is amiss with the voter rolls.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/21/trump-overturn-vote-kamala-harris-lawyers/\">The Harris campaign</a>, voting rights lawyers, and civil rights groups are all preparing for the possibility of a chaotic post-election period that could include a flood of lawsuits trying to get ballots thrown out in an attempt to swing the election.</p> <p>While there is little doubt that Trump will try and contest an election loss, experts are also nearly certain that he will not succeed. Judges turned away nearly every case Trump filed to try and overturn the election results \u2013 61 in total \u2013 and experts expect that they will do so again.</p> <p>Lawyers and election officials have also spent the last four years learning from what happened and are prepared to swiftly go to court at the first whiff of disruption. The month following election day could be chaotic and confusing, but they\u2019re confident that the rightful winner of the election will ultimately be certified.</p> <p>\u201cThe response to these attempts is also more coordinated and prepared. Election officials have seen what the election deniers playbook looks like over the last couple of elections and know what to prepare for,\u201d Morales-Doyle said.</p> <h2>Vote-rigging allegations</h2> <p>Trump\u2019s effort to contest a possible loss is likely to begin as votes are counted on election night. Just like 2020, it is likely that there will not be a winner declared on election night and key swing states are going to take hours or even days to count their ballots. The closer the election margin \u2013 and it could be very close this year \u2013 the longer it will take for news outlets to be confident enough to call the race, which could add to the uncertainty.</p> <p>There\u2019s nothing unusual about that lag. But Trump is planning to declare that the vote against him is rigged and that the slow count is evidence something is amiss, Rolling Stone <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-election-rigged-slow-vote-count-2024-1235133890/\">reported in October</a>.</p> <p>That declaration of fraud is likely to be accompanied by swift lawsuits alleging various irregularities with the vote, supported by affidavits from people who say they saw something unusual at the polls or when workers are counting votes. While those claims are likely to be debunked, they\u2019re likely to fuel the narrative that something wrong happened in 2020.</p> <p>The Republican National Committee is already forecasting what these suits will look like. Over the last several months, they have filed suits in swing states alleging that states have dead people, non-citizens and other ineligible people on their voter rolls and asked courts to remove them. Judges have already tossed many of the lawsuits.</p> <p>In Michigan, a swing state, for example, the Republican National Committee<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/14/rnc-michigan-voting-rolls-lawsuit\"> filed a lawsuit in March claiming</a> that 76 of the state\u2019s 83 counties had more eligible voters than citizens eligible to vote or \u201csuspiciously high\u201d voter registration rates. The RNC sent out a press release accompanying the suit, saying it showed Michigan had \u201cinflated and inaccurate voter rolls ahead of the 2024 election\u201d and the suit earned many headlines.</p> <p>Michigan officials noted that the RNC had not identified a \u201csingle voter in any Michigan county who is ineligible to be registered but nonetheless appears as an active voter.\u201d A federal judge <a href=\"https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-10-22-Order-and-opinion-granting-defendants-motion-to-dismiss.pdf\">dismissed the case on 22 October</a>, finding that Michigan already had reasonable procedures for removing voters (federal law requires a waiting period before a state can remove a voter it suspects has moved from rolls).</p> <p>The watchdog group Protect Democracy calls these and similar lawsuits <a href=\"https://protectdemocracy.org/work/the-lurking-danger-of-zombie-lawsuits/\">\u201czombie lawsuits\u201d </a>and predicts that Trump and allies could try and revive them after election day to challenge the election results.</p>    <p>Nikhel Sus, a lawyer with Crew, predicted Trump and allies would revive some of the suits they\u2019ve already filed, but that they wouldn\u2019t go far.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to see these zombie lawsuits come back to life in a strategic tactical way. And perhaps that was the goal from the outset,\u201d he said. \u201cYou still need evidence to win a court case.\u201d</p> <p>Filing a case challenging voter eligibility before the election doesn\u2019t give it a better chance of succeeding afterwards, Morales-Doyle of the Brennan Center said. Still, he said the litigation gives a false imprimatur to Trump\u2019s claims of fraud.</p> <p>\u201cI do think you\u2019re going to see after the election if people are upset about the outcome, pointing to \u201cwe\u2019ve been saying for the last 8 months that they had bloated rolls and dead people on the rolls. Non-citizens on the rolls and the courts didn\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>After those suits are filed, Trump could move on to trying to stop certification of the vote at the local level. Long a little-followed process of elections, certification takes place at the local and state level to officialize vote totals after all of the ballots are tallied. Local boards \u2013 often staffed with party loyalists or little-known government officials \u2013 are responsible for undertaking this task, and generally do not have discretion not to certify.</p> <p>But since 2020, Trump-aligned Republicans have embraced the idea that officials can refuse to certify the vote, something voting experts say is illegal. Across the country this year, officials on local boards of election have refused to certify primary and other elections, citing vague concerns about fraud. None of those efforts have been successful, and all of the boards have been forced to certify the results in the end.</p> <p>Georgia, one of the seven battleground states, has been at the center of this push. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/04/republican-julie-adams-georgia-election-integrity-network\">Republican commissioners</a> in Fulton county, home to Atlanta, have refused to certify elections twice this year. Trump-aligned Republicans on the State Election Board also passed last-minute rules this year that could have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/06/georgia-local-election-boards-allowed-withhold-vote-certification\">paved the pathway</a> for local election officials to not certify the vote in November. A local judge<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/22/politics/georgia-supreme-court-maintains-block-on-controversial-new-election-rules/index.html\"> blocked the rules</a>, and said that discretion in the state is mandatory.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Sus said he still expects that there will be local officials throughout the country who refuse to certify the vote, forcing groups to go to court to force certification.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-guardian-live-world-news/id409128287?mt=8\">Get our free app</a> and sign up for election alerts</strong></p></li> </ul> <p>\u201cEven though it\u2019s illegal and there will be potential stiff legal consequences for doing that sort of thing, it will cause some level of disruption,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a chance that by sowing distrust at the county level if president Trump loses the election that they\u2019re going to lay the groundwork to dispute the results on January 6 2025 on the grounds that there was uninvestigated fraud or irregularities in particular states.\u201d</p> <p>Trump and Republicans could try and bring a final challenge when Congress issues the final certification of the electoral college vote on January 6, 2025.

And that\u2019s why they\u2019re allowing them to come into our country.\u201d</p> <p>Other top Republicans have followed suit and amplified the false claims. And Republican election officials in a handful of states \u2013 Alabama, Texas, Virginia, and Tennessee \u2013 have all <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/03/trump-republicans-non-citizen-voters-myth-stolen-election\">tried to back up Trump </a>by releasing statements claiming to have found thousands of non-citizens on the rolls.

      "bodyText": "There is little doubt that Donald Trump will refuse to accept a defeat in November\u2019s US presidential election. The former president, who is deadlocked in the polls with Kamala Harris, has spent months priming his supporters to believe the only way he could lose is through fraud. \u201cIf I lose \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you what, it\u2019s possible. Because they cheat. That\u2019s the only way we\u2019re gonna lose, because they cheat,\u201d he said at a rally in September. He has refused to say, several times, that he will unequivocally accept the results of the election, only going as far to say that he will if \u201cit\u2019s fair and legal and good\u201d. Having escaped any accountability for the attack on the Capitol on January 6, he has embraced those who violently attacked the US government to protest against the 2020 election results, calling it a \u201cday of love\u201d. JD Vance, his running mate, has, at times, been even more forthright. The Ohio senator has said he would not have certified the 2020 race. During the vice-presidential debate in early October, he refused to say that Trump lost the 2020 election. He later said, more definitively, that he did not believe Trump lost four years ago. But this year the Trump ticket\u2019s efforts to pre-emptively deny the results in case of a loss of the election go beyond rhetoric. They are now backed up by widespread party support and a highly organized, massive legal apparatus. \u201cThe effort to try to subvert the outcome is more thought-out, more strategic, more organized, more coordinated than in 2020,\u201d said Sean Morales-Doyle, director of the voting rights program at the Brennan Center for Justice. Republicans are primed to support Trump\u2019s efforts. Nearly one in five Republican voters believe Trump should declare the election result invalid if he loses, according to a recent survey by the Public Religion Research Institute (12% of Democrats said Harris, who has committed to accepting the election results, should do the same). Dozens of people who have challenged the results of the last presidential election are in local offices where they have power over certifying vote totals. Led by Cleta Mitchell, a Trump ally who aided his efforts to overturn the election four years ago, Republicans have organized a massive effort to monitor election offices, challenge voters, and work in election precincts. At least 35 officials who have refused to certify elections since 2020 will have a role over certifying the vote this fall, according to a report by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), a watchdog group. The Republican National Committee has spent months filing frivolous lawsuits that contain specious allegations of fraud. Legal experts say Republicans have no chance of winning the suits ahead of the election \u2013 many have already been thrown out of court \u2013 but they are instead designed to generate headlines and create the impression that something is amiss with the voter rolls. The Harris campaign, voting rights lawyers, and civil rights groups are all preparing for the possibility of a chaotic post-election period that could include a flood of lawsuits trying to get ballots thrown out in an attempt to swing the election. While there is little doubt that Trump will try and contest an election loss, experts are also nearly certain that he will not succeed. Judges turned away nearly every case Trump filed to try and overturn the election results \u2013 61 in total \u2013 and experts expect that they will do so again. Lawyers and election officials have also spent the last four years learning from what happened and are prepared to swiftly go to court at the first whiff of disruption. The month following election day could be chaotic and confusing, but they\u2019re confident that the rightful winner of the election will ultimately be certified. \u201cThe response to these attempts is also more coordinated and prepared. Election officials have seen what the election deniers playbook looks like over the last couple of elections and know what to prepare for,\u201d Morales-Doyle said. Vote-rigging allegations Trump\u2019s effort to contest a possible loss is likely to begin as votes are counted on election night. Just like 2020, it is likely that there will not be a winner declared on election night and key swing states are going to take hours or even days to count their ballots. The closer the election margin \u2013 and it could be very close this year \u2013 the longer it will take for news outlets to be confident enough to call the race, which could add to the uncertainty. There\u2019s nothing unusual about that lag. But Trump is planning to declare that the vote against him is rigged and that the slow count is evidence something is amiss, Rolling Stone reported in October. That declaration of fraud is likely to be accompanied by swift lawsuits alleging various irregularities with the vote, supported by affidavits from people who say they saw something unusual at the polls or when workers are counting votes. While those claims are likely to be debunked, they\u2019re likely to fuel the narrative that something wrong happened in 2020. The Republican National Committee is already forecasting what these suits will look like. Over the last several months, they have filed suits in swing states alleging that states have dead people, non-citizens and other ineligible people on their voter rolls and asked courts to remove them. Judges have already tossed many of the lawsuits. In Michigan, a swing state, for example, the Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit in March claiming that 76 of the state\u2019s 83 counties had more eligible voters than citizens eligible to vote or \u201csuspiciously high\u201d voter registration rates. The RNC sent out a press release accompanying the suit, saying it showed Michigan had \u201cinflated and inaccurate voter rolls ahead of the 2024 election\u201d and the suit earned many headlines. Michigan officials noted that the RNC had not identified a \u201csingle voter in any Michigan county who is ineligible to be registered but nonetheless appears as an active voter.\u201d A federal judge dismissed the case on 22 October, finding that Michigan already had reasonable procedures for removing voters (federal law requires a waiting period before a state can remove a voter it suspects has moved from rolls). The watchdog group Protect Democracy calls these and similar lawsuits \u201czombie lawsuits\u201d and predicts that Trump and allies could try and revive them after election day to challenge the election results. Nikhel Sus, a lawyer with Crew, predicted Trump and allies would revive some of the suits they\u2019ve already filed, but that they wouldn\u2019t go far. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see these zombie lawsuits come back to life in a strategic tactical way. And perhaps that was the goal from the outset,\u201d he said. \u201cYou still need evidence to win a court case.\u201d Filing a case challenging voter eligibility before the election doesn\u2019t give it a better chance of succeeding afterwards, Morales-Doyle of the Brennan Center said. Still, he said the litigation gives a false imprimatur to Trump\u2019s claims of fraud. \u201cI do think you\u2019re going to see after the election if people are upset about the outcome, pointing to \u201cwe\u2019ve been saying for the last 8 months that they had bloated rolls and dead people on the rolls.

      "body": "<p>It was my post-college girlfriend who introduced me to Avital. She was seeing Avital herself. From my apartment on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side, I took the F train down to Midwood in south Brooklyn and walked past rows of low-slung homes until I reached hers. I used the below-ground entrance, as I\u2019d been told.</p> <p>Avital herself answered the door. (Most of the names here have been changed.) She wore sneakers, a below-the-knee skirt and a wig. She kept her right hand out of the way so I wouldn\u2019t try to shake it. Behind her was a suburban-style basement converted into a kind of doctor\u2019s office, with a treatment room off the main hallway. Inside, I removed my shirt and sat on a medical table laid with exam-table paper.</p> <p>When Avital came in, she rubbed a numbing cream all over my shoulders and back. I tried to relax. I was here for a treatment. There was no other circumstance under which an Orthodox Jewish woman could be alone in the same room with me, let alone touching my body.</p> <p>Avital wrapped my chest in clingfilm so the cream wouldn\u2019t rub off, and sent me to wander the neighbourhood for 40 minutes while it did its work. To make things extra weird, I walked from eastern Midwood, dominated by religious Jews, to western Midwood, dominated by ex-Soviet immigrants, like my family. I stopped in front of my grandfather\u2019s apartment building. He thought religious people were nuts, but otherwise he was as traditional as Avital, and he would have been mortified \u2013 terrified \u2013 to learn his grandson was getting his body hair lasered off by an Orthodox&nbsp;Jewish woman a 15-minute walk from his home.</p> <p>Easy for him: his body was as smooth as a grape. I took after my father, whose line passes down no hair on the head and too much everywhere else.

Miriam was from a Modern Orthodox Jewish family \u2013 the Modern part signifies a greater integration with the secular world. But even this liberalisation left us far apart. My maternal grandmother was a Holocaust survivor and I, too, had felt my share of violent antisemitism before I left the country, aged nine.

Others, too: I fantasised about the American west, which felt freer and less formed, and she idolised New York.</p> <p>Perhaps it was unfair to put the question to Avital, who also lasered Miriam, but I put it: what else could Miriam and I try? Looking away, Avital said, \u201cMaybe you\u2019ve tried everything there is to try.\u201d For all the boundary-crossing we did in that room, I hadn\u2019t expected such directness. I hadn\u2019t considered that there might be no way to save something so promising.</p> <p>It was many years before I understood that Avital was giving me a great gift \u2013 the gift of candour. Candour is the mark of true intimacy, and candour is risky \u2013 I was a little afraid of asking Avital\u2019s opinion after that.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>I didn\u2019t have to \u2013 Miriam learned that waxing was less expensive than lasering and we bid Avital a bittersweet farewell. We made our way to Shira, on the Upper West Side. Shira was a divorced Israeli woman with a shy, ailing son. A daughter of Yemenite immigrants, she was as secular as I was and I joked to Miriam that at least in the depilation department, the pendulum had swung toward my view of the world.</p> <p>Shira was a true artist of the trade \u2013 though waxing was even more painful than lasering, she was done before I had finished my first story. But I wanted to keep telling it, and listening to hers \u2013 she told me about her divorce, her worries that it had made her son reticent, her dreams of moving to Florida. She was a warm and attractive woman, with a dash of Israeli abrasiveness, so, with her permission, I tried to find her a partner.</p> <p>It was during the Shira era that, after eight years, Miriam finally broke up with me. Shira heard about it a lot, and never made me feel self-indulgent. But she was as direct as Avital: Miriam and I didn\u2019t belong together.</p> <p>Not a lot of people get waxed more often than they need to, but during those years I did. Shira was politically conservative, and I wasn\u2019t, but it never got in the way of our, yes, friendship. We commiserated about dating in New York \u2013 it was even harder for her, a woman in her late 40s. We laughed until we snorted about that time I ate a bowl of my aunt\u2019s garlicky roasted peppers right before a date and radiated garlic out of my pores in the sweltering heat of the bar. My date kept asking why the bar smelled so strongly of garlic when they didn\u2019t have a food menu. Shira\u2019s stories were less funny \u2013 men stood her up; they made disrespectful demands; they intended to tell her who she could be.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I thought twice before taking off my shirt at the pool, in the locker room, on the beach, in the bedroom</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Perhaps because I was less at pains to avoid even the intimation of bodily contact that I had with Avital, I allowed myself to consider Shira as a physical being. It seems impossible not to when a hand of the opposite gender is dripping hot wax on your body and then soothing the depilated spot with a touch of her latex glove, her waistline inches from your nose. Avital had been slim, almost gaunt; Shira was full-bodied, with dyed corkscrew curls and a neat pedicure \u2013 from my vantage point, belly-down on her exam table, it was the only part of her I could see.</p> <p>This country, every country, is full of Shiras \u2013 nail technicians, masseuses, hairdressers, waxers. Many of us are grateful to them, but how many of us wonder where they go for touch, for <em>their</em> shearing and renewal? Shira waxed herself, which felt like a bittersweet metaphor for her life.</p> <p>I saw Shira for nearly a decade, enough time to publish my first novel, meet the woman I married, have my first child, and for Shira to get a real-estate licence and watch her son grow up to become more self-possessed. One of the first things I did after meeting Jessica, my wife, was to bring her to Shira\u2019s house for dinner \u2013 Shira taught me how to make the poached fish of her ancestors. Jessica (her real name) comes from Wasps who don\u2019t touch, but she hugged Shira as soon as she came in. As we were leaving, Shira said, with an affectionate eye roll, \u201cLooks like you finally did it.\u201d The moment felt right, and I gave her a hug.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>I left Shira only because we left New York during Covid. The years that followed were as unstable in the waxing realm as in every other: I had waxers in Miami Beach; Bellingham, Washington; and, finally, Missoula, Montana, where I was teaching in a literary programme. Montana is a physical place \u2013 people hike and hunt, work in manual trades \u2013 but it\u2019s not a place of the body. In New York, the sultriness steams off the sidewalk and people are forever fixing themselves and touching each other. In Montana, people dressed to conceal, and interacted without much physical contact. Surreally, it felt more transgressive to undress in Heather\u2019s waxing studio in Missoula than in Avital\u2019s in Brooklyn.</p> <p>It\u2019s the curse of every person with multiple identities \u2013 if I felt hopelessly secular around Avital and American around Shira, I felt ethnic and east coast-ish around Heather. But we were bound by other things: we were contemporaries; had started over in different American places; she was embarking on a new relationship, as I had. These experiences had left her with a humility I revere in people \u2013 a sign of wisdom and strength. She told me about her sons, and I told her she was the first regular waxer I\u2019d found without Miriam.</p>    <p>There was one subject from which I stayed away: Montana. If there\u2019s one thing on which even politically unalike Montanans agree, it\u2019s that it\u2019s the last best place, as the local phrase has it. I had been dreaming about it for decades. To have found a teaching job there felt like grace after nearly 20 years of hard survival as a writer.</p> <p>Montana was magnificent: calm, affordable, an easy place to raise children. But it was also earnest and plainspoken, and Jessica and I couldn\u2019t shake a vicious longing for the ferment \u2013 the knowing wit, the irreverence, the hustle \u2013 of a large city like the one that had raised us. I knew the answer to the question in our minds. It had been given to me by Avital and Shira all those years ago: sometimes, even the perfect thing isn\u2019t right. It was a bitter understanding: for decades, I had sought a way out of New York. When it finally came, I was too much of a New Yorker to make it there. But is that the same thing as home?</p> <p>The last time I saw Heather, only I knew it was the last time. Could the word \u201cbetrayal\u201d apply to a relationship as \u201ccasual\u201d as a waxer\u2019s with a client, the term mine always used for me, no matter how close we became? Just then, the unequivocal answer seemed to be yes.</p> <p>I told her we were leaving. I added, truthfully, that her studio was one of the few places where the interpersonal disconnect didn\u2019t apply. It takes a great deal of emotional maturity to acknowledge someone else\u2019s views without pretending they\u2019re your own, and that is the parting gift Heather gave me. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first bright light this town has lost,\u201d she said. It\u2019s one of the most generous things anyone has ever said to me.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>That summer, I gave up my job and we drove 2,500 miles \u201cback to where I came from\u201d, as I\u2019d been told to do so often by my no-mercy classmates in Brooklyn. I called Miriam, who had become a dear friend, and told her she\u2019d been right about New York. \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t been,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019ll be so good to have you near.\u201d</p> <p>My family settled in rural New Jersey. Jessica and I joke that it\u2019s the \u201cMontana of New Jersey\u201d, an otherwise liberal state \u2013 our county went for Trump, and the smokestacks and highway exits most people associate with New Jersey couldn\u2019t feel more remote here. It\u2019s painfully pretty, and empty, and as plainspoken as an in-your-face place like New Jersey gets. Go figure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/nov/29/i-stopped-trying-to-control-my-body-the-women-who-gave-up-grooming-in-2020\">\u2018I stopped trying to control my body\u2019: the women who gave up grooming in 2020</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even before we\u2019d settled in, I found myself a waxer. I was born 7,000 kilometers away, and Erin has never been on a plane. She lives paycheck to paycheck; I have a retirement investment account. We both love country music, but only I love it a little ironically. Still, by this point, it takes effort not to give her a hug every time I come into her fluorescent-lit office at the local European Wax Center. I know when she is getting married, how much she paid for the DJ, what the cake will look like.</p> <p>Even if the script feels familiar \u2013 even if, over the last 20 years, Erin and her predecessors have provided a singular companionship during the anonymity of life in New York and then the instability of so many moves \u2013 the script always changes. The other day, I looked in the mirror and, like a delayed reaction dislodging from the autopilot of a too-busy life, I saw something I never thought I would: the hair on my body had thinned out so much that I wasn\u2019t sure I needed my forthcoming appointment. Either that, or I\u2019d finally become comfortable with myself as I was.</p> <p>I was stunned. I had dreamed of this moment for decades. How many times had I stood in front of the mirror, squinting and scrutinising? How many times had I thought twice before taking off my shirt at the pool, in the locker room, on the beach, in the bedroom? How hard had I worked to keep my eastern European peasant body in shape, to make up for the fact that it had so much hair? How hard had I worked, in therapy and beyond, to become OK with myself?</p> <p>I still don\u2019t like New Jersey; I feel at home in America less than ever; writing as a profession never gets simpler. However, at some point over the last decade, the dream \u2013 The Mission \u2013 morphed from achievement to serenity, to aligning with my circumstances instead of overpowering them. I am as far away from serenity as I\u2019ve ever been. But I think I\u2019m dreaming about the right thing now. In front of that mirror, I felt like my body was rewarding me for it. It was telling me: <em>Keep going</em>.</p> <p>Who knows what I\u2019ll do next time it\u2019s time for a wax \u2013 it still hurts, it still costs a lot \u2013 but I kept my appointment with Erin. She told me she can\u2019t go grocery shopping with her fiance because he\u2019s an impulse shopper. I told her what I\u2019d felt in front of that mirror. </p> <p><em>Boris Fishman\u2019s new novel, The Unwanted, will be published in the US in March.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "It was my post-college girlfriend who introduced me to Avital. She was seeing Avital herself. From my apartment on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side, I took the F train down to Midwood in south Brooklyn and walked past rows of low-slung homes until I reached hers. I used the below-ground entrance, as I\u2019d been told. Avital herself answered the door. (Most of the names here have been changed.) She wore sneakers, a below-the-knee skirt and a wig. She kept her right hand out of the way so I wouldn\u2019t try to shake it. Behind her was a suburban-style basement converted into a kind of doctor\u2019s office, with a treatment room off the main hallway. Inside, I removed my shirt and sat on a medical table laid with exam-table paper. When Avital came in, she rubbed a numbing cream all over my shoulders and back. I tried to relax. I was here for a treatment. There was no other circumstance under which an Orthodox Jewish woman could be alone in the same room with me, let alone touching my body. Avital wrapped my chest in clingfilm so the cream wouldn\u2019t rub off, and sent me to wander the neighbourhood for 40 minutes while it did its work. To make things extra weird, I walked from eastern Midwood, dominated by religious Jews, to western Midwood, dominated by ex-Soviet immigrants, like my family. I stopped in front of my grandfather\u2019s apartment building. He thought religious people were nuts, but otherwise he was as traditional as Avital, and he would have been mortified \u2013 terrified \u2013 to learn his grandson was getting his body hair lasered off by an Orthodox Jewish woman a 15-minute walk from his home. Easy for him: his body was as smooth as a grape. I took after my father, whose line passes down no hair on the head and too much everywhere else. At the steam baths, people said, \u201cThere goes the Bear.\u201d They said it affectionately, and he was never self-conscious about it. But I felt desperately ashamed of the inheritance. The Soviet Union was full of men like my father. (Women, too.) But our new homeland seemed to venerate grooming \u2013 of hair, of scent, even of touch.

It was a bitter understanding: for decades, I had sought a way out of New York. When it finally came, I was too much of a New Yorker to make it there. But is that the same thing as home? The last time I saw Heather, only I knew it was the last time. Could the word \u201cbetrayal\u201d apply to a relationship as \u201ccasual\u201d as a waxer\u2019s with a client, the term mine always used for me, no matter how close we became? Just then, the unequivocal answer seemed to be yes. I told her we were leaving. I added, truthfully, that her studio was one of the few places where the interpersonal disconnect didn\u2019t apply. It takes a great deal of emotional maturity to acknowledge someone else\u2019s views without pretending they\u2019re your own, and that is the parting gift Heather gave me. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first bright light this town has lost,\u201d she said. It\u2019s one of the most generous things anyone has ever said to me. * * * That summer, I gave up my job and we drove 2,500 miles \u201cback to where I came from\u201d, as I\u2019d been told to do so often by my no-mercy classmates in Brooklyn. I called Miriam, who had become a dear friend, and told her she\u2019d been right about New York. \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t been,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019ll be so good to have you near.\u201d My family settled in rural New Jersey. Jessica and I joke that it\u2019s the \u201cMontana of New Jersey\u201d, an otherwise liberal state \u2013 our county went for Trump, and the smokestacks and highway exits most people associate with New Jersey couldn\u2019t feel more remote here. It\u2019s painfully pretty, and empty, and as plainspoken as an in-your-face place like New Jersey gets. Go figure. Even before we\u2019d settled in, I found myself a waxer. I was born 7,000 kilometers away, and Erin has never been on a plane. She lives paycheck to paycheck; I have a retirement investment account. We both love country music, but only I love it a little ironically. Still, by this point, it takes effort not to give her a hug every time I come into her fluorescent-lit office at the local European Wax Center. I know when she is getting married, how much she paid for the DJ, what the cake will look like. Even if the script feels familiar \u2013 even if, over the last 20 years, Erin and her predecessors have provided a singular companionship during the anonymity of life in New York and then the instability of so many moves \u2013 the script always changes. The other day, I looked in the mirror and, like a delayed reaction dislodging from the autopilot of a too-busy life, I saw something I never thought I would: the hair on my body had thinned out so much that I wasn\u2019t sure I needed my forthcoming appointment. Either that, or I\u2019d finally become comfortable with myself as I was. I was stunned. I had dreamed of this moment for decades. How many times had I stood in front of the mirror, squinting and scrutinising? How many times had I thought twice before taking off my shirt at the pool, in the locker room, on the beach, in the bedroom? How hard had I worked to keep my eastern European peasant body in shape, to make up for the fact that it had so much hair? How hard had I worked, in therapy and beyond, to become OK with myself? I still don\u2019t like New Jersey; I feel at home in America less than ever; writing as a profession never gets simpler. However, at some point over the last decade, the dream \u2013 The Mission \u2013 morphed from achievement to serenity, to aligning with my circumstances instead of overpowering them. I am as far away from serenity as I\u2019ve ever been. But I think I\u2019m dreaming about the right thing now. In front of that mirror, I felt like my body was rewarding me for it. It was telling me: Keep going. Who knows what I\u2019ll do next time it\u2019s time for a wax \u2013 it still hurts, it still costs a lot \u2013 but I kept my appointment with Erin. She told me she can\u2019t go grocery shopping with her fiance because he\u2019s an impulse shopper. I told her what I\u2019d felt in front of that mirror.

When residents are unable to pay for their property taxes from the previous year, their land could be auctioned at an annual tax sale in October, which is how dozens of Gullah owners have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/03/gullah-geechee-auction-land-real-estate-south-carolina\">lost their properties</a> in recent years. \u201cSo the CPO has absolutely no advantages for the Gullah people.\u201d <br><br>Ultimately, the proposed golf course has served as an ideological battleground for St Helena residents, with some advocating for increased development and infrastructure and others considering it a threat to environmental preservation and the Gullah Geechee way of life. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep asking the question of the people who live within the CPO district,\u201d said Emory Campbell, a former Penn Center executive director. \u201cAre you satisfied with your lifestyle now versus the lifestyle of [the more developed island] Hilton Head?\u201d</p> <h2>A \u2018dangerous and bad precedent\u2019</h2> <p>St Helenaville was once a small village and a port for steamers transporting cotton from the island to the mainland until the civil war, when the white residents fled and Black freedmen from other parts of the south occupied the area.</p> <p>In 1867, after President Andrew Johnson <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbpe.23600800/?sp=2&amp;st=image\">pardoned Confederate landowners</a> and allowed them to <a href=\"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/a73616da14944289ae1c832d5fe3bd1a\">return to their properties</a>, white people started to flock back to St Helena Island. Still, for several centuries, the Gullah Geechee have preserved their distinct culture and customs. The island remains one of the last largely undeveloped sites in the area, which can be partly attributed to the CPO\u2019s success in protecting the land from outside developers.</p>    <p>Despite tens of thousands of petition signatures and dozens providing opposing testimony at county council meetings for over a year, the developer Elvio Tropeano has <a href=\"https://www.islandpacket.com/news/local/article277161218.html\">challenged</a> Beaufort county\u2019s efforts to prevent the golf course in state and federal district courts. His legal challenges question the validity of the CPO as he has pushed for his luxury golf course plan to be approved by county government. Tropeano denied multiple requests for an on-the-record interview.</p> <p>On 16 September, in a win for proponents of the CPO, the Beaufort county council hosted an executive meeting where they voted 8-3 to reject Tropeano\u2019s golf course plans and to back the zoning requirements. But hearings are yet to be set for the state and federal appeals. If Tropeano is granted an exception to the CPO to allow for the development of his golf course, it could create a \u201cdangerous and bad precedent for Beaufort County and St Helena\u201d, said Jessie White, a director at the environmental advocacy organization the Coastal Conservation League, which helped form the CPO and is one of several organizations that <a href=\"https://coastalconservationleague.org/news/partner-groups-file-coordinated-motions-to-intervene-in-pine-island-case/\">filed a motion </a>to intervene in the case. On 18 October, the Beaufort county council filed a motion to dismiss in the federal case.</p> <p>\u201cIt signals that St Helena is basically open for any developer to come to Beaufort county and try to use financial means, political pressure to get whatever rules they want for a development,\u201d said White about the threat the cases pose. \u201cIt essentially undermines the continuation of the CPO, because the CPO has very specific and limited restrictions and if the county were to allow one developer to pursue those very explicit restrictions, there\u2019s really no way for them to say no to the next person who comes and asks for the same treatment.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Young people leave and don\u2019t come back\u2019</h2> <p>As a journalist covering Beaufort county in the 1990s, Gullah Geechee resident Theresa White observed members of her community and family hosting fish fries, selling cakes and pies to raise money to pay for their property taxes. She witnessed older people on fixed incomes borrow loans to cover their taxes and then have to take out another loan when taxes came due, she said. The endless cycle of debt that she saw in her community inspired White to found the Pan-African Family Empowerment and Land Preservation Network to help people find solutions to stay in their homes. Theresa White sees the CPO as a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d that helps protect the land at the expense of Gullah Geechee residents.</p>    <p>\u201c[The CPO] keeps the resorts and whatever it is they don\u2019t want to come from coming, but it also keeps the people who own land that could be profitably developed and create generational wealth and that wouldn\u2019t have to be lost because they couldn\u2019t pay taxes from being developed,\u201d said White. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like they\u2019re choking themselves to death.\u201d</p> <p>As of 2022, she said that her organization spent more than $80,000 helping people retain their properties including by paying people\u2019s property taxes and redeeming properties that were sold at tax sales. White said that she supports Tropeano because she believes that he\u2019s standing up for Gullah people who want to have more freedom in what they choose to do with their land. In her work, she said that she\u2019s seen people lose their homes to delinquent property taxes because they were hamstrung by the CPO.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people sold property that they wouldn\u2019t otherwise because they couldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d White said. \u201cPeople are afraid to come out and say that \u2018our family has lost land because of the CPO and we could lose our land because of the CPO because we can\u2019t do anything with it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Enslaved Africans <a href=\"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/a73616da14944289ae1c832d5fe3bd1a\">made up the majority of St Helena Island</a> prior to the civil war, but today white residents are 65% of the population. Black residents compose just a quarter of St Helena\u2019s population <a href=\"https://data.census.gov/table/DECENNIALDHC2020.P8?g=060XX00US4501392927\">according to 2020 census data</a>.</p> <p>Marilyn Hemingway, the founder of the Gullah Geechee chamber of commerce, is also in support of the Pine Island development because she believes that residents were not properly informed of Tropeano\u2019s plans to create jobs on the golf course and to use revenue to invest in the community. While originally in opposition to the plan, she said that after meeting Tropeano at Pine Island and learning more about his plans that she had a change of heart and encouraged the city council to negotiate with him.</p>    <p>Hemingway argues that some development on St Helena Island could bring vitality to the area. \u201cYoung people leave for education and economic opportunities. And by and large, they don\u2019t come back,\u201d Hemingway said. \u201cSo the question becomes, what actions can we do to reverse that?\u201d She envisions that the golf course development would help create jobs and invest in the local community so that young Gullah Geechee adults don\u2019t have to leave St Helena to make a living.</p> <h2>\u2018Unwise planning can impact them for a lifetime\u2019</h2> <p>On a traffic-free drive around St Helena Island in late spring, Marquetta L Goodwine, an author and artist known as Queen Quet, passed one-story houses and oak trees draped with Spanish moss. As the car slowed down to let a wake of buzzards cross the road, she exclaimed: \u201cThat\u2019s life in the country!\u201d</p> <p>As the chair of the cultural protection overlay district committee, she works with Beaufort county to strengthen zoning ordinances. According to Queen Quet, the CPO has no bearing on delinquent taxes: \u201cThere\u2019s nobody that\u2019s been displaced here by the cultural protection overlay district. The environment has been protected. Land ownership has been maintained by native Gullah Geechees.\u201d Instead, she sees Tropeano\u2019s development plan as a colonialist tactic meant to sow division among her community.</p> <p>For many Gullah Geechee people, golf courses have been considered the \u201cbeginning of the end\u201d, said the Penn Center\u2019s director, Robert Adams. \u201cAt the heart of the idea of the CPO is \u2018no golf course\u2019. It invites all of the tourist infrastructure and it raises the prices of taxes for local residents who are already having a hard time holding on to their land.\u201d</p> <p>Campbell, the former Penn Center executive director, sees the effects of the CPO whenever he drives from Hilton Head Island, which has a four-lane highway, to St Helena Island, where the highway switches to two lanes.</p>    <p>In light of new threats to the overlay, the Penn Center will revive its educational program in 2025 and rename it the Emory Shaw Campbell Preservation School. Participants will range in age from teenagers to middle age \u2013 a demographic that the Penn Center believes will lead the future of the community. The center plans to have four cohorts of 360 people from throughout Beaufort county. It hopes that the new iteration of the school will help participants recreate the CPO in other cities and islands.</p> <p>Campbell said he believes that younger generations hold the key to the island\u2019s preservation: \u201cWe gotta make sure that [young people] understand the value of their lifestyle now on St Helena versus the lifestyle of urbanized areas.\u201d</p> <p>As they spoke against the Pine Island development at county council meetings throughout 2023, the Penn Center realized that people born after 1970 were not civically engaged, said Deloris Pringle, the chair of the Penn Center\u2019s board of trustees. \u201cThey just don\u2019t know the tactics,\u201d said Pringle. \u201cThey don\u2019t know the issues and they don\u2019t know how unwise decisions and unwise planning can impact them for a lifetime and impact their descendants.\u201d</p> <p>The Penn Center hopes that St Helena\u2019s CPO will be used as a model for other sea islands along the coast and that with additional funding that it will spread. Pringle added: \u201cIt is one of the best tools that communities can use in order to create good land use policy and development policy.\u201d</p>",

Marilyn Hemingway, the founder of the Gullah Geechee chamber of commerce, is also in support of the Pine Island development because she believes that residents were not properly informed of Tropeano\u2019s plans to create jobs on the golf course and to use revenue to invest in the community. While originally in opposition to the plan, she said that after meeting Tropeano at Pine Island and learning more about his plans that she had a change of heart and encouraged the city council to negotiate with him. Hemingway argues that some development on St Helena Island could bring vitality to the area. \u201cYoung people leave for education and economic opportunities. And by and large, they don\u2019t come back,\u201d Hemingway said. \u201cSo the question becomes, what actions can we do to reverse that?\u201d She envisions that the golf course development would help create jobs and invest in the local community so that young Gullah Geechee adults don\u2019t have to leave St Helena to make a living. \u2018Unwise planning can impact them for a lifetime\u2019 On a traffic-free drive around St Helena Island in late spring, Marquetta L Goodwine, an author and artist known as Queen Quet, passed one-story houses and oak trees draped with Spanish moss. As the car slowed down to let a wake of buzzards cross the road, she exclaimed: \u201cThat\u2019s life in the country!\u201d As the chair of the cultural protection overlay district committee, she works with Beaufort county to strengthen zoning ordinances. According to Queen Quet, the CPO has no bearing on delinquent taxes: \u201cThere\u2019s nobody that\u2019s been displaced here by the cultural protection overlay district. The environment has been protected. Land ownership has been maintained by native Gullah Geechees.\u201d Instead, she sees Tropeano\u2019s development plan as a colonialist tactic meant to sow division among her community. For many Gullah Geechee people, golf courses have been considered the \u201cbeginning of the end\u201d, said the Penn Center\u2019s director, Robert Adams. \u201cAt the heart of the idea of the CPO is \u2018no golf course\u2019. It invites all of the tourist infrastructure and it raises the prices of taxes for local residents who are already having a hard time holding on to their land.\u201d Campbell, the former Penn Center executive director, sees the effects of the CPO whenever he drives from Hilton Head Island, which has a four-lane highway, to St Helena Island, where the highway switches to two lanes. In light of new threats to the overlay, the Penn Center will revive its educational program in 2025 and rename it the Emory Shaw Campbell Preservation School. Participants will range in age from teenagers to middle age \u2013 a demographic that the Penn Center believes will lead the future of the community. The center plans to have four cohorts of 360 people from throughout Beaufort county. It hopes that the new iteration of the school will help participants recreate the CPO in other cities and islands. Campbell said he believes that younger generations hold the key to the island\u2019s preservation: \u201cWe gotta make sure that [young people] understand the value of their lifestyle now on St Helena versus the lifestyle of urbanized areas.\u201d As they spoke against the Pine Island development at county council meetings throughout 2023, the Penn Center realized that people born after 1970 were not civically engaged, said Deloris Pringle, the chair of the Penn Center\u2019s board of trustees. \u201cThey just don\u2019t know the tactics,\u201d said Pringle. \u201cThey don\u2019t know the issues and they don\u2019t know how unwise decisions and unwise planning can impact them for a lifetime and impact their descendants.\u201d The Penn Center hopes that St Helena\u2019s CPO will be used as a model for other sea islands along the coast and that with additional funding that it will spread. Pringle added: \u201cIt is one of the best tools that communities can use in order to create good land use policy and development policy.\u201d",

Her memoir, Vanessa Bares All, is out now.</p> <h2><strong>Vanessa</strong></h2> <p>This photograph was the beginning of everything.

As they didn\u2019t have especially smart or bright clothes, the American company that co-produced the show sent me a&nbsp;suit for free.

Within minutes of the show ending, my husband left. It was as if he&nbsp;thought: \u201cRight, there\u2019s no point sticking around any longer.\u201d For the first time in my life, I was so devastated I couldn\u2019t eat. I lost the most prodigious amount of weight, so I gave all my TV suits to Oxfam. They had to send a&nbsp;truck because there were dozens: seven royal blue, 17 turquoise, 12 pink, 20 beige. For a&nbsp;brief moment, I&nbsp;was slim, and would wear PVC trousers, or other ill-advised garments I\u2019d never fitted into previously.

College students amble around the shops as streets away worshippers march uphill to the mosque for afternoon prayer. The scene is not one of political upheaval and yet, a little over three months ago, that is exactly what took place in this industrial Lancashire town. Formerly a Labour stronghold, steeped in the working traditions of its textile making past, Blackburn is no longer represented by the red rose party. In July, its voters rejected Labour in favour of the independent candidate, Adnan Hussain, a 34-year-old solicitor who narrowly won the seat by 132 votes. It is the first time since the creation of the single member constituency in 1955 that Blackburn has not voted Labour.

The set of results \u2013 which all came in constituencies with high Muslim populations \u2013 was undoubtedly born of a deep dissatisfaction over Labour\u2019s stance on the war in Gaza. But election night also showed how a major British political party could be vulnerable to independents, something previously unthinkable in the UK electoral system where power gravitates toward the established political authorities. For Labour, the shock waves were dampened by its resounding overall win, but for the constituents of Blackburn, Birmingham, Leicester and Dewsbury and Batley, uncharted waters lay ahead: parliamentary representation by an MP with no party machine behind them. Despite their voice in Westminster now being a political outsider, voters in Blackburn are already warming to Hussain.

Adnan Hussain said he had been true to his election pledges over the past 100 days in office on both foreign policy and domestic \u2013 issues such as the winter fuel allowance cuts and two-child benefit cap. Representing \u201cone of the most economically deprived\u201d towns in the UK, and one that is \u201cdeeply segregated along racial lines\u201d, he added that one of the most challenging moments was to ensure the unrest from the summer riots did not reach Blackburn.

      "body": "<p>\u2018I\u2019d love to work again, to have a reason to get out of bed in the morning,\u201d says Michelle. The former accountant from Barnsley has been out of work since the pandemic, but has found jobhunting tough amid a battle with the depression and anxiety she has faced since her teenage years.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve come out of a 30-year marriage. I got my first sicknote at the age of 57, first time unemployed. And everything went down hill from there,\u201d she says, wringing her hands under the table in a dimly lit room at the town\u2019s adult learning centre, alongside a dozen others in a similar position.</p> <p>Across the country there are more than 9 million people like Michelle who are not employed or currently seeking a job \u2013 a position statisticians describe as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peoplenotinwork/economicinactivity\">economically inactive</a>\u201d. For almost 3 million, the main reason is long-term ill-health, which is near to its highest level on record, fuelling the sharpest decline in Britain\u2019s workforce since the 1980s.</p> <p>Next week, Rachel Reeves is expected to prioritise the issue in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/budget\">Labour\u2019s first budget since 2010</a>. Getting more people back to work is seen by the chancellor as one of the most powerful ways to reboot economic growth, while her tax and spending decisions \u2013 alongside plans to fix public services \u2013 will be geared up to boost workforce participation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/archive-2-zip/giv-4559FTm5DD73bG57/\" data-alt=\"Health related inactivity in Barnsley\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/archive-2-zip/giv-4559FTm5DD73bG57/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>In Barnsley, the problem is particularly acute: an economic inactivity hotspot, it was visited by Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, in July for <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/getting-britain-working\">a landmark speech</a> setting out how the newly elected government would reform employment support.</p> <p>For decades, the South Yorkshire former coalmining town experienced mass unemployment and above-average deprivation \u2013 the legacy of pit closures. But in the past four years, for the first time since deindustrialisation, Barnsley has a new challenge: more vacancies than people looking for work. While <a href=\"https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/la/1946157120/printable.aspx\">3,000 residents are unemployed and seeking a job, 10 times as many are economically inactive</a> \u2013 more than a third because of a health condition, significantly above the national average.</p> <p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t dream about that 20 years ago. But suddenly employers are struggling to get people, and there aren\u2019t enough around,\u201d says Steve Houghton, leader of the local Labour-run council, who set up a groundbreaking commission, Pathways to Work, to investigate the issue.</p> <p>Drawing together some of Britain\u2019s top experts in employment and health, and chaired by the Blair-era health secretary Alan Milburn, the commission this summer recommended a four-year pilot scheme to help 2,200 people into work. The town, alongside the three neighbouring districts \u2013 Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield \u2013 is asking for \u00a347m from Reeves\u2019s budget to get it off the ground.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re hoping there\u2019s a line somewhere in the budget statement that says a pilot for South Yorkshire. If it confirms that, then we can crack on with the detail,\u201d Houghton says.</p> <p>\u201cEconomic inactivity is a big thing holding Barnsley back, particularly the health issues scarring the community. Some of that is long-term, from coalmining and industry, but there\u2019s also a wider problem.\u201d</p>    <p>Experts debate the causes of rising inactivity, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/09/uk-economy-being-held-back-by-worsening-health-of-british-public-andy-haldane-warns\">crumbling public services are agreed by many to be one of the driving forces</a>.

      "bodyText": "\u2018I\u2019d love to work again, to have a reason to get out of bed in the morning,\u201d says Michelle. The former accountant from Barnsley has been out of work since the pandemic, but has found jobhunting tough amid a battle with the depression and anxiety she has faced since her teenage years. \u201cI\u2019ve come out of a 30-year marriage. I got my first sicknote at the age of 57, first time unemployed. And everything went down hill from there,\u201d she says, wringing her hands under the table in a dimly lit room at the town\u2019s adult learning centre, alongside a dozen others in a similar position. Across the country there are more than 9 million people like Michelle who are not employed or currently seeking a job \u2013 a position statisticians describe as \u201ceconomically inactive\u201d. For almost 3 million, the main reason is long-term ill-health, which is near to its highest level on record, fuelling the sharpest decline in Britain\u2019s workforce since the 1980s. Next week, Rachel Reeves is expected to prioritise the issue in Labour\u2019s first budget since 2010. Getting more people back to work is seen by the chancellor as one of the most powerful ways to reboot economic growth, while her tax and spending decisions \u2013 alongside plans to fix public services \u2013 will be geared up to boost workforce participation. In Barnsley, the problem is particularly acute: an economic inactivity hotspot, it was visited by Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, in July for a landmark speech setting out how the newly elected government would reform employment support. For decades, the South Yorkshire former coalmining town experienced mass unemployment and above-average deprivation \u2013 the legacy of pit closures. But in the past four years, for the first time since deindustrialisation, Barnsley has a new challenge: more vacancies than people looking for work. While 3,000 residents are unemployed and seeking a job, 10 times as many are economically inactive \u2013 more than a third because of a health condition, significantly above the national average. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t dream about that 20 years ago. But suddenly employers are struggling to get people, and there aren\u2019t enough around,\u201d says Steve Houghton, leader of the local Labour-run council, who set up a groundbreaking commission, Pathways to Work, to investigate the issue. Drawing together some of Britain\u2019s top experts in employment and health, and chaired by the Blair-era health secretary Alan Milburn, the commission this summer recommended a four-year pilot scheme to help 2,200 people into work. The town, alongside the three neighbouring districts \u2013 Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield \u2013 is asking for \u00a347m from Reeves\u2019s budget to get it off the ground. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping there\u2019s a line somewhere in the budget statement that says a pilot for South Yorkshire. If it confirms that, then we can crack on with the detail,\u201d Houghton says. \u201cEconomic inactivity is a big thing holding Barnsley back, particularly the health issues scarring the community. Some of that is long-term, from coalmining and industry, but there\u2019s also a wider problem.\u201d Experts debate the causes of rising inactivity, but crumbling public services are agreed by many to be one of the driving forces. NHS waiting lists have surged to record levels, with more than 6 million people awaiting treatment, while employment support has been slashed. The pandemic also had an impact. Even though inactivity was rising beforehand, the additional pressure on an already overwhelmed health service has made it harder to keep the nation fit for work. And while Covid had a direct health impact for many, the resulting recession and lockdowns had far-ranging consequences that are still being felt. Outside the new Glass Works shopping centre there is a reminder that Barnsley suffered more than most \u2013 in a bronze memorial to the key workers who kept the country going, with words on its plinth by the local poet Ian McMillan: Barnsley\u2019s fierce love holds you forever in its heart. \u201cCovid hit here really hard. Over 1,000 died,\u201d says Houghton. \u201cWe got hit hard, as did most economically deprived areas, and why is that? Because the health was poor to start with, and this just came off and finished people off in some cases.\u201d Research by the Resolution Foundation shows the rise in economic inactivity has been \u201cU-shaped by age\u201d, fuelled by those aged 16-24 and 50-64, who account for 90% of the increase.

Michelle Williams, 40, juggles looking after her two children with studying at Barnsley college.

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s an enormous amount of pressure for couples choosing the right song to soundtrack their wedding\u2019s first dance. It\u2019s not just that it\u2019s three minutes (or more) where all your friends and family are staring at you. It\u2019s also about what that song says about you and your relationship. What about when you\u2019re a musician getting married? Choose wrong and, well, it\u2019s not just your career in question. A range of musicians across different genres have bravely put their reputations on the line for you to judge \u2013 and not all of them stand by their choices \u2026</p>    <h2><strong>Charlie Simpson, Busted</strong></h2> <p><strong>Hopp\u00edpolla by Sigur R\u00f3s</strong><br>My wife and my first dance song was Hopp\u00edpolla by Sigur R\u00f3s, which was a really weird choice. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think it\u2019s an unbelievable song and it means something special to us, but if we could go back and do it again, we would probably pick a different one. I don\u2019t think my wife will be angry at me for saying that.</p> <p>We went through quite a few different options, but we just wanted something that was really moving and a song that we could enjoy in the moment. What we didn\u2019t think through was what everyone else would do while we danced. Usually people come in and join the proceedings, but that vibe never really materialised because the song is so slow and it\u2019s not that well known. </p> <p>To be honest though, when I was dancing with my wife, it didn\u2019t really matter what song was playing. At that moment, everyone and everything just disappeared except me and her and I was able to take in the gravity of what it meant to commit my life to another person.<br><em>Tickets for Busted v</em><em> McFly\u2019s 2025 tour are on sale now.</em></p>    <h2><strong>Kate Pierson, </strong><strong>the</strong> <strong>B-52s</strong></h2> <p><strong>Crush</strong><strong> Me With Your Love by Sia</strong><br>My wife and I have been together for almost 20 years, but we got married in 2015 after it became legal in the United States, and it was really beautiful. But we couldn\u2019t get it together to actually organise the wedding. We thought: \u201cShouldn\u2019t we just get married in Hawaii?\u201d Sure enough, the B-52s had a gig in Hawaii, so we got married there. Our friend Sia was there and she sang Crush Me With Your Love, which is a song she wrote for me for my first solo album. </p> <p>I\u2019m also a wedding officiant and I\u2019ve done about five weddings. Every one that I\u2019ve officiated, they want to play Love Shack or have me sing Love Shack. It\u2019s definitely a must-play at weddings. But if I had to choose another first dance song that wasn\u2019t by the B-52s, I&nbsp;would say The Best Is Yet to Come by Frank Sinatra and Count Basie.<br><em>Kate Pierson\u2019s Radios &amp; Rainbows is out now.</em></p>    <h2><strong>Chesney Hawkes, </strong><strong>90s&nbsp;soft rocker</strong></h2> <p><strong>Unforgettable by Nat King Cole</strong><br>When we got married on the Fourth of July in 1997 we chose Unforgettable by Nat King Cole as our first dance song.</p> <p>The lyrics to that song are so beautifully romantic for me, and in a classic way, say all that a perfect wedding song should say. It\u2019s incredible that someone so unforgettable thinks I am unforgettable, too.</p> <p>It\u2019s quite funny, though \u2013 when I was asked to do this, my wife sent me a text telling me she couldn\u2019t remember what the song was! I laughed to myself because it\u2019s supposed to be unforgettable! So it was a beautiful moment remembered by me, forgotten by my wife.<br><em>Chesney Hawkes\u2019 new single, </em><em>Get </em><em>a Hold </em><em>of Yourself,</em><em> is&nbsp;out&nbsp;now.</em></p>    <h2><strong>Jax Jones, </strong><strong>chart-topping</strong><strong> house DJ</strong></h2> <p><strong>I Got U by Duke Dumont ft Jax Jones</strong><br>We chose one of my songs, I Got U, which I did with Duke Dumont and which samples Whitey Houston\u2019s My Love Is Your Love, because it\u2019s a song that meant a lot to myself and my wife. It was inspired by the beginning of our relationship when we got together and it reflected that early honeymoon period. I was 24, I\u2019d been dropped by my record label and was just starting out again, dabbling in house music. I Got U was one of the first tracks I made and I remember how much she loved it when I first played it to her. I\u2019ve always loved the Whitney original, so I just repurposed it to impress my wife.</p> <p>I tried to get Mariah Carey to come to my wedding. My wife wanted to see who we could get to come and sing. She was like: \u201cWhy can\u2019t we utilise your fame to sort this out?\u201d We started at Mariah Carey and had to work our way down when we found out she costs $1m.</p> <p>In the end, we got Ella Henderson to record a version of the Jackson 5 song I\u2019ll Be There for the wedding, which I blended it into I Got U, so it became a mashup. All of our friends were aware of how much that song means and what it represents for us.<br><em>Tickets for Jax Jones\u2019s It\u2019s </em><em>the Pop Up Tour But Bigger</em><em> Tour</em><em> in the UK are on sale now.</em></p>    <h2><strong>The Blessed Madonna, </strong><strong>DJ-producer</strong></h2> <p><strong>Devotion by Ten City</strong><br>Well it wasn\u2019t the most traditional of weddings to begin with. Our friends threw it for us at someone\u2019s house, which was a condo that was created for the purpose of shooting pornography. But my friends lived there and one of the upsides was that it had a dancefloor and a bar. We didn\u2019t have a first dance. It just didn\u2019t happen and I think that\u2019s fair because my husband and I have had thousands of other dances. Our entire relationship has played out on dancefloors. But what I can say was the closest we had to a first dance on that day was Devotion by Ten City. I have lots of wonderful memories of playing that record in a very specific way for me.</p> <p>The most important dance of that night was one with my mother-in-law, who is Ukrainian. We found the one single common ground musically, sonically and culturally, which was Abba. They say there are no universals in life, but surely one has to be Abba.<br><em>The Blessed Madonna\u2019s </em><em>debut album, Godspeed</em><em>, is&nbsp;out&nbsp;now.</em></p>    <h2><strong>Oh Wonder, married alt-pop duo</strong></h2> <p><strong>All My Friends by LCD Soundsystem</strong></p> <p>We judge weddings on the last song of the night&nbsp;because&nbsp;that\u2019s like the bow on a present and the&nbsp;final&nbsp;chance for everyone to give it their all. So we&nbsp;actually focused our energy on the last song of&nbsp;our&nbsp;wedding, which was All My Friends by LCD&nbsp;Soundsystem. It\u2019s a nearly eight-minute song&nbsp;that&nbsp;just&nbsp;builds and builds, and you really have&nbsp;to lock into it&nbsp;because&nbsp;it\u2019s&nbsp;very repetitive. So by the end&nbsp;of&nbsp;the song&nbsp;it was all our mates and immediate family with our arms around each other in a huge circle&nbsp;just jumping. That was the highlight of the wedding for us.<br><em>Shark</em><em>: 10 Years On </em><em>is out now.</em></p>    <h2><strong>Melissa Bonny, Ad Infinitum vocalist</strong></h2> <p><strong>Hold My Hand by Lady Gaga</strong><br>We picked Hold My Hand by Lady Gaga from Top Gun: Maverick. We watched the movie together when it came out and we instantly fell in love with the song. When we were thinking about our first dance, I knew that we both loved this song, so when I suggested it to my husband he said: \u201cLet\u2019s go for it.\u201d</p> <p>What was interesting was at the wedding right after we&nbsp;had our first dance, my husband and I were performing together with two guys from my band. I&nbsp;found the dance part to be the scariest because you\u2019re&nbsp;in the middle of everybody with all eyes on you. Then once Hold My Hand finished, we went straight to&nbsp;our instruments and started playing Paramore\u2019s Still&nbsp;Into You.</p> <p><em>Tickets for Kamelot: Awaken the World Tour are now&nbsp;on&nbsp;sale.</em></p>    <h2><strong>Paul Russell, TikTok-powered rapper and singer</strong></h2> <p><strong>Georgia on My Mind by Ray Charles</strong></p> <p>We had our wedding planned for 2020, but then Covid happened. So we got married on Zoom, and then we had a real wedding in 2021 where we had our first dance to Ray Charles\u2019s Georgia on My Mind. From pretty early on, we had decided that was going to be the one. It\u2019s always been a song that my wife loves, and I\u2019m from Georgia originally. We always thought it was kind of a funny thing that she loved the song, but she\u2019s not from Georgia at all.</p> <p>When I proposed, I made sure Georgia on My Mind was playing. So the song has connections from different moments in our relationship and it has that quality where it feels very sincere. It just felt like the right choice.<br><em>Paul Russell\u2019s </em><em>debut EP Again </em><em>Sometime? </em><em>is out now</em><em>.</em></p>    <h2><strong>Tigran Hamasyan, Armenian</strong><strong> jazz pianist</strong></h2> <p><strong>Tamzara, traditional Armenian folk dance</strong><br>I got married nine years ago and it was a traditional Armenian wedding. This meant the first dance was the Tamzara and it\u2019s actually instrumental, so there\u2019s no singing. It\u2019s also not just my wife and I alone on the dancefloor. We did the Tamzara as a circle dance which meant we were in the centre and surrounded by our friends and family. This dance in Armenia is really about the community and the energy&nbsp;I&nbsp;felt that day was something I\u2019ve never experienced before.<br><em>Tigran Hamasyan </em><em>is performing at </em><em>Cadogan Hall, London on 17 November.</em></p>    <h2><strong>Tamar-kali</strong><strong>, alt-rocker and </strong><strong>OutKast collaborator</strong></h2> <p><strong>Just </strong><strong>the Two </strong><strong>of Us by Bill&nbsp;Withers and Grover Washington Jr</strong><br>We love music&nbsp;and my partner is a very serious jazz head and our wedding was also around the time that there was&nbsp;that documentary, Still Bill, about Bill Withers that had just&nbsp;come out. So the song my husband and I chose was Just the Two of Us by&nbsp;Bill Withers and Grover Washington Jr.</p> <p>Usually our favourite Bill songs to listen to are Grandma\u2019s Hands or Use Me. But for some reason we were listening to Just the Two of Us and maybe because it was a popular 80s hit, people underestimate the lyrical content of that song. They say some very profound things about love and we used some of it for our vows. There\u2019s a line that says \u201cwe look for love, no time for tears / Wasted water\u2019s all that is, it and it don\u2019t make no flowers grow\u201d, and that beautiful metaphor and language really spoke to us.<br><em>Tamar-kali\u2019s latest opera work, </em><em>SWANN</em><em>, is out now.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Millions of dollars worth of Beatles memorabilia changes hands every year, so the owners of a mixing console used to create Abbey Road hoped they might reap a \u00a31.4m bonanza when they auctioned it last year. But bids didn\u2019t meet their reserve price, so now they have taken a different tack: instead of targeting fans, they are appealing to musicians who might actually use it. Although there is no Beatlemania index showing fluctuations in the value of John Lennon\u2019s handwritten lyrics or Paul McCartney\u2019s collarless jackets, markets for vintage wines, rare whiskies, classic cars and fine art have seen a downturn in the past year, as people who view these luxuries as investment vehicles have turned elsewhere for profit. Musical instruments and equipment are different: both objects of desire and inspirations of creativity. Musicians can spend years lusting after a microphone or synthesiser they believe will allow them to create a particular sound. \u201cMusic gear is meant to be played,\u201d said Antoine Bourgougnon, vintage electronics expert at Reverb, an online marketplace for musical instruments. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so special about the Abbey Road console \u2013 of course, it\u2019s a piece of history, but it\u2019s also been restored to be in perfect working condition, so that it can go on to make even more music for years to come.\u201d The EMI TG12345 Mk1 desk will be available to buy on Tuesday from Reverb, where Noel Gallagher, Green Day and Evanescence have all sold equipment in the past.

Like every other sovereign country in the world, the state of Israel has the right and the duty to respond.\u201d</p> \n<p>Israel is fearful of a costly war of attrition with Iran while it is already fighting ground operations in two different theatres. After Tehran fired its first ever direct salvo at Israel in April in retaliation for the killing of a senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander in Syria, Israel heeded western calls for restraint, striking an air defence battery at an Iranian airbase.</p> \n<p>Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said this week that enemies would \u201cpay a heavy price\u201d for trying to harm Israel.</p> \n<p>The White House was notified shortly before Israel carried out airstrikes on Iran, a spokesperson said, and the president, Joe Biden, was closely following developments. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, had said on Wednesday that Israel\u2019s retaliation should not lead to greater escalation.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe understand that Israel is conducting targeted strikes against military targets in Iran as an exercise of self-defence and in response to Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack against Israel on October 1st,\u201d said Sean Savett, the White House national security council spokesperson.</p> \n<p>State media in Syria also reported Syrian air defences had intercepted \u201chostile targets\u201d and \u201csounds of explosions\u201d near the capital city, Damascus, on Saturday. </p>",

However, an Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander hinted on Thursday that Tehran would be unlikely to retaliate further if Israel\u2019s attack was considered \u201climited\u201d and did not cause casualties. The US news outlet Axios reported on Saturday that US and Israeli officials assess that Iran will respond militarily, but in a limited fashion. It also said that Israel had conveyed a message to Iran on Friday warning the Iranians not to respond. There has been no change to the Israeli Home Front\u2019s guidance for civilians, suggesting that an Iranian retaliation is not expected to be imminent. In the statement on Saturday, Israel\u2019s military said the attacks were a retaliation for a number of attacks against Israel, including the 7 October 2023 raid by the Iran-allied Palestinian group Hamas, in which 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 abducted. Israel responded by launching the war in the Gaza Strip, which has devastated the region and killed at least 42,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas health ministry. Israel has also launched aerial and ground operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah, another powerful militia in Tehran\u2019s \u201caxis of resistance\u201d, after a year of tit-for-tat cross-border fire that displaced hundreds of thousands of people on both sides of the border. The fighting in Gaza has drawn in other Iranian proxies operating in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. The IDF statement read: \u201cThe regime in Iran and its proxies in the region have been relentlessly attacking Israel since October 7th \u2013 on seven fronts \u2013 including direct attacks from Iranian soil. Like every other sovereign country in the world, the state of Israel has the right and the duty to respond.\u201d Israel is fearful of a costly war of attrition with Iran while it is already fighting ground operations in two different theatres. After Tehran fired its first ever direct salvo at Israel in April in retaliation for the killing of a senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander in Syria, Israel heeded western calls for restraint, striking an air defence battery at an Iranian airbase. Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said this week that enemies would \u201cpay a heavy price\u201d for trying to harm Israel. The White House was notified shortly before Israel carried out airstrikes on Iran, a spokesperson said, and the president, Joe Biden, was closely following developments. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, had said on Wednesday that Israel\u2019s retaliation should not lead to greater escalation. \u201cWe understand that Israel is conducting targeted strikes against military targets in Iran as an exercise of self-defence and in response to Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack against Israel on October 1st,\u201d said Sean Savett, the White House national security council spokesperson. State media in Syria also reported Syrian air defences had intercepted \u201chostile targets\u201d and \u201csounds of explosions\u201d near the capital city, Damascus, on Saturday.",

They were keen to add a top striker to Enzo Maresca\u2019s squad and the Sweden international was prominent in their thoughts. Was a deal possible?

      "bodyText": "It was an idea briefly explored, a conversation that soon died a death, but there was a moment last summer when Chelsea were talking about including Nicolas Jackson as part of a deal that would have taken Newcastle\u2019s Alexander Isak in the opposite direction. There was much admiration for Isak at Chelsea. They were keen to add a top striker to Enzo Maresca\u2019s squad and the Sweden international was prominent in their thoughts. Was a deal possible? Newcastle had concerns regarding profitability and sustainability regulations, although they were never going to sell Isak on the cheap. The only way to make it work was to follow the route favoured by a lot of Premier League clubs: alter the fee by throwing in players as part of the bargain. The talks never went anywhere, though, and perhaps that is just as well for Chelsea given that Jackson is in flying form before Newcastle visit on Sunday afternoon. The Senegal international scored his fifth goal of the season in last weekend\u2019s unfortunate defeat by Liverpool and is doing much to silence suggestions that the only thing missing from Maresca\u2019s squad, other than a reliable goalkeeper, is a world-class No 9. How, pundits have wondered, can it be that Chelsea have spent so much without ensuring that they had a lethal finisher leading the line? How could the co-sporting directors, Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart, be so shortsighted? How could the owners not have moved heaven and earth to sign Victor Osimhen from Napoli? The irony is that Chelsea are being rewarded for gambling on Jackson in the summer of 2023. They have overspent on some signings, but Jackson is beginning to look like a bargain. He joined from Villarreal for only \u00a331.8m \u2013 Rasmus H\u00f8jlund cost Manchester United \u00a372m \u2013 and despite occasionally being a target of derision during his debut season in England, is clearly moving in the right direction under Maresca\u2019s guidance.

      "body": "<p>Whether or not the term Silk Roads is&nbsp;a myth or a handy catch-all for a dauntingly wide geographical network spanning mountain chains, deserts, cities and seas, the idea of it still entices travellers. There are countless extraordinary places to explore along its various strands from Asia to Europe, and these 10 choices represent only a handful of highlights. </p> <p>There were as many Silk Road threads passing through war-torn lands centuries ago as there are today. Some of these destinations are currently off the traveller\u2019s map for ethical or&nbsp;safety reasons, but given their historical importance it would be wrong to leave them off the list.</p> <h2><strong>Old City of Damascus, Syria</strong></h2>    <p>Damascus is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, a place of living antiquity that has drawn invaders \u2013 among them the Greeks, the Abbasids and the Seljuk Turks \u2013 and curious travellers for centuries. The city\u2019s craft industry was&nbsp;famed for its decorated swords and lace, and while Damask silk originated in China it takes its name from the trading city of Damascus. One of the most arresting sights is the Umayyad mosque (pictured), also known as the Great Mosque of Damascus, a gem of&nbsp;the early Islamic world dating to the&nbsp;period when the Umayyads established their capital in Damascus in 661. After the start of the Syrian civil war the ancient city of Damascus was added to Unesco\u2019s list of world heritage in danger in 2013.</p> <h2><strong>\u0130shak Pasha Palace, Turkey</strong></h2>    <p>Set on a lonely rock, close to the town of Do\u011fubayaz\u0131t in eastern Turkey, is the strikingly photogenic \u0130shak Pasha Palace, with its dramatic stone-domed mosque and minaret boasting Ottoman, Persian and Seljuk influences. Commissioned by the family of \u0130shak Pasha, who was vizier of the area, it was completed after the Silk Roads era&nbsp;in 1784, though its lofty position was strategic, overlooking the entire valley, which is crisscrossed with old Silk Roads pathways leading to Georgia and Iran and the caravan route from Tabriz to the Black Sea ports. The road to the palace also passes the ancient <a href=\"https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bayazit-bayazid-osm\">Bayazit Castle</a>, a&nbsp;fortress in the shadows of Mount Ararat, where merchants travelling the&nbsp;Silk Roads would stop and store their goods.</p> <h2><strong>Selim Caravanserai, Armenia</strong></h2>    <p>Sometimes called Orbelian\u2019s Caravanserai, after the noble family who built it, this is an ancient inn or hostel for merchants completed in 1332 and located by the remote Selim Pass in southern Armenia. It is a long, low-slung and dimly lit building, with just one entrance (a useful barrier against thieves and bitter winters) and it doesn\u2019t take too much imagination, as&nbsp;you enter through a doorway decorated with a bull and a lion, to picture merchants of old gathered in one arched section, their animals in another with their basalt feeding troughs. The caravanserai sits on an ancient international trade passage connecting to bordering Iran, though for modern-day travellers it is handily on one of the <a href=\"https://transcaucasiantrail.org/en/home/\">Trans-Caucasian Trail</a> walking routes. You can drive up to&nbsp;it,&nbsp;too.</p> <h2><strong>Uplistsikhe, Georgia</strong></h2>    <p>To see this once-thriving trading town, one of the oldest known settlements in the Caucasus, head east&nbsp;from the Georgian city of Gori, the&nbsp;birthplace of Stalin, to honeycomb-coloured Uplistsikhe where strands of&nbsp;the Silk Roads once ran close by.&nbsp;From the sixth century BC, Uplistsikhe, built high on the rocky bank of the Mtkvari River, developed into a religious centre and metropolis that was slowly hewn from solid stone. What is left today are the remains of the inner city, where once 20,000 people lived with a market, temples, palaces, winery, bakery and sewers. Given the foundations that remain, it&nbsp;is surprisingly easy to imagine the daily life of its citizens. The rest of ancient Uplistsikhe was flattened by the Mongols in the 13th century.</p> <h2><strong>Tabriz, Iran</strong></h2>    <p>A network of interconnected bazaars stretching over at least 100 hectares (250 acres), the Unesco-listed <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1346/\">Tabriz Historic Bazaar Complex</a> is set in handsome domed halls and under fine brick vaulting with sections selling leather, silver, copper, spices and, of course, rugs. With its origins dating to&nbsp;the 10th century, it was one of the most important commercial centres on&nbsp;the Silk Roads thanks to its strategic location and policies of tax exemptions, though it was also known as a place of&nbsp;social gatherings and education. Today, it remains a living example of Silk Roads culture where craftspeople, artists, tobacconists, tailors, calligraphers and bookbinders from different cultures mix and trade in its&nbsp;laneways.</p> <h2><strong>Merv, Turkmenistan</strong></h2>    <p>With its fortifications, mosques and mausoleums, the ancient city of Merv,&nbsp;in Turkmenistan\u2019s Mary region, has been home to human settlements since the bronze age; some historians have suggested that by the 10th century it was the third largest city in&nbsp;the world. But that isn\u2019t all. It&nbsp;was also once one of the most important cities in the Islamic world, attracting traders, scholars and travellers from distant regions, and today it is considered one of the oldest and best-preserved of the oasis-cities on&nbsp;central Asia\u2019s Silk Roads. A&nbsp;particularly eye-catching sight is the recently restored 12th-century Sultan Sanjar Mausoleum, a rare example of Seljuk commemorative architecture. The Mary regional museum, with its Seljuk bronze-ware and Mongol ceramics, is also recommended.</p> <h2><strong>Termez, Uzbekistan</strong></h2>    <p>Close to Afghanistan, Termez is the southernmost city of Uzbekistan, set&nbsp;on&nbsp;the ancient Amu Darya (Oxus) River. It became an important commercial centre under the ancient Kushan Empire, stretching from northern India&nbsp;to Afghanistan and parts&nbsp;of central Asia, which promoted trade not&nbsp;only of goods but, in classic Silk Roads style, also craftsmanship, ideas and religious renaissance. Today Termez attracts small&nbsp;numbers of Silk Roads enthusiasts who arrive for the ancient Buddhist sites on the outskirts of town.&nbsp;Fayoz-Tepe is the most visited, a&nbsp;Buddhist monastery complex, that&nbsp;appears a little&nbsp;like a Star Wars film&nbsp;set, with its&nbsp;sand-coloured dome&nbsp;the size and shape of an igloo. Surrounding the platform lay fragmented foundations of&nbsp;former meditation halls, kitchens, sleeping cells and ancient water pipes that drew&nbsp;from the nearby river. The city also has a good museum for context.</p> <h2><strong>Taxila, Pakistan</strong></h2>    <p>Easily reachable by car from Islamabad (though Alexander the Great took the long road to get here), Taxila is a Unesco world heritage site and a true archaeological wonder. Situated at a Silk Roads crossroads, the \u201cCity of Cut Stone\u201d was one of the ancient capitals of Gandhara, a territory stretching between the Oxus and Indus rivers. Among the vast site today is a Mesolithic cave and, most crucially, Buddhist monuments and the remains of monasteries dotted through the Taxila valley, evidence of how it was once a religious heartland and a destination for pilgrims and monks who had travelled from China and central Asia. The city\u2019s museum, close to the excavations, is home to at least 2,000 priceless objects.</p> <h2><strong>Issyk-Kul, Kyrgyzstan</strong></h2>    <p>Ringed by mountains, sea buckthorn bushes and Soviet-era sanatoriums once popular with commissars and cosmonauts, Lake Issyk-Kul is where Kazakhs, Russians and Kyrgyz go to&nbsp;sunbathe and swim in the summer. A branch of the Silk Roads once ran from the lake, known as the \u201cpearl of Kyrgyzstan\u201d, across the border to Kashgar in Xinjiang, China, homeland of the Muslim Uyghurs. For more than 2,000 years Kashgar was a hub of regional trade and cultural exchange, full of teahouses, mosques and marketplaces. Today, much of old Kashgar, as with other Uyghur towns and cities, has been demolished or irrecoverably altered by&nbsp;Beijing as the brutal crackdown against the Uyghur people continues.</p> <h2><strong>Dunhuang, China</strong></h2>    <p>Dunhuang is an oasis city and pilgrimage site in north-west China that is home to the magnificent <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/440/\">Mogao grottoes</a>. One of the most important collections of Buddhist art in the world, housed in cells and sanctuaries lining a cliff face above the Dachuan River, the wall paintings tell an illustrated story of the Silk Roads from the fourth to the 14th centuries. Almost 500 caves have been preserved, housing countless murals and more than 2,000 painted sculptures. Cave 302 from the Sui dynasty period contains a particularly classic Silk Roads scene: a two-humped Bactrian camel pulling a wagon with a merchant inside.</p> <p><em>Caroline Eden\u2019s latest book</em><em> is Cold Kitchen: a Year of Culinary Journeys (Bloomsbury, \u00a318.99).

Situated at a Silk Roads crossroads, the \u201cCity of Cut Stone\u201d was one of the ancient capitals of Gandhara, a territory stretching between the Oxus and Indus rivers. Among the vast site today is a Mesolithic cave and, most crucially, Buddhist monuments and the remains of monasteries dotted through the Taxila valley, evidence of how it was once a religious heartland and a destination for pilgrims and monks who had travelled from China and central Asia. The city\u2019s museum, close to the excavations, is home to at least 2,000 priceless objects. Issyk-Kul, Kyrgyzstan Ringed by mountains, sea buckthorn bushes and Soviet-era sanatoriums once popular with commissars and cosmonauts, Lake Issyk-Kul is where Kazakhs, Russians and Kyrgyz go to sunbathe and swim in the summer. A branch of the Silk Roads once ran from the lake, known as the \u201cpearl of Kyrgyzstan\u201d, across the border to Kashgar in Xinjiang, China, homeland of the Muslim Uyghurs. For more than 2,000 years Kashgar was a hub of regional trade and cultural exchange, full of teahouses, mosques and marketplaces. Today, much of old Kashgar, as with other Uyghur towns and cities, has been demolished or irrecoverably altered by Beijing as the brutal crackdown against the Uyghur people continues. Dunhuang, China Dunhuang is an oasis city and pilgrimage site in north-west China that is home to the magnificent Mogao grottoes. One of the most important collections of Buddhist art in the world, housed in cells and sanctuaries lining a cliff face above the Dachuan River, the wall paintings tell an illustrated story of the Silk Roads from the fourth to the 14th centuries. Almost 500 caves have been preserved, housing countless murals and more than 2,000 painted sculptures. Cave 302 from the Sui dynasty period contains a particularly classic Silk Roads scene: a two-humped Bactrian camel pulling a wagon with a merchant inside.

      "bodyText": "The television ads show seniors playing tennis, golfing and riding motorcycles. In others, celebrity pitchmen seniors will know \u2013 such as actor William Shatner, NFL star Joe Namath and former Republican Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee \u2013 promise new benefits alongside pictures of government-issued ID cards. All of these are ads for Medicare Advantage and if Donald Trump wins the White House, Americans might be seeing a lot more of them. That\u2019s because one of Republicans\u2019 only healthcare policy specifics involves further privatizing the program \u2013 selling more plans that commercials just like these advertise. \u201cWe groan when we see [Medicare] Advantage as insurance,\u201d said Dr Karen Kinsell, the only doctor in Fort Gaines, Georgia, a rural community where more than a third of the population lives below the poverty line. Medicare Advantage is private insurance paid for by the federal government, a program authorized in 1997 amid concerns about Medicare\u2019s cost. Insurance companies promised cheaper plans with better benefits. One of the most important differences for patients is the imposition of \u201cnetworks\u201d in Medicare Advantage plans, or a limited number of doctors and hospitals a patient can see at a discounted rate. Traditional Medicare does not include networks \u2013 98% of providers in the US participate. Most people pay a standard monthly rate of $174.70 for both Medicare and Medicare Advantage. Medicare Advantage plans can be enticing because they often include food or transportation cards, $0 monthly premiums for drugs benefits, and hearing, vision and dental benefits \u2013 none of which are included in traditional Medicare. Kinsell notes that the problems usually start when people get sick. \u201cPatients have been unable to get into rehab, or stay,\u201d she said. Others were charged $50 a day for rehab when the service is normally free for a short period in traditional Medicare. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a lot of time in our district office with seniors who got hoodwinked by these corporate insurance plans,\u201d said Democratic US representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington state. Jayapal has called for \u201curgent reforms\u201d and consumer protections to be added to Medicare Advantage. \u201cThey took the name \u2013 so seniors actually think they\u2019re signing up for Medicare,\u201d she said. Despite complaints from doctors and patients, fraud investigations, allegations insurers used artificial intelligence models to deny care to seniors, and a pile of evidence that Medicare Advantage costs taxpayers more, Republicans have continued to boost the program. The most specific healthcare policy proposals are set forth by Project 2025, the conservative playbook by the Heritage Foundation. Amid a thicket of gripes about vaccine mandates and no less than 199 mentions of abortion, the document also proposes further privatizing Medicare through Medicare Advantage. Medicare Advantage \u201cprovides beneficiaries with a wide range of competitive health plan choices \u2013 a richer set of benefits than traditional Medicare provides and at a reasonable cost\u201d, Project 2025 argues. Republicans should make it the default enrollment option and \u201cremove burdensome policies that micromanage\u201d plans, the document said. The document also proposes to \u201cgive beneficiaries direct control of how they spend Medicare dollars\u201d, which Democrats argue describes a voucher program, something Republicans tried to push in the Trump administration. \u201cThat has been the playbook for privatization of Medicare really since these corporate Medicare \u2018dis-Advantage\u2019 plans \u2013 that\u2019s what I call them \u2013 started,\u201d said Jayapal. \u201cIt was their in-road.\u201d That, like a lot of Donald Trump\u2019s proposals, is likely to cost the federal government a lot of money. \u201cThe federal government is significantly overpaying Medicare Advantage plans in relation to what it spends on an individual and traditional Medicare \u2013 without corresponding significant gains to show for it,\u201d said David Lipschutz, co-director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy. Studies show Medicare Advantage plans will cost the federal government an estimated $83bn more than traditional Medicare in 2024 without corresponding improvements in health, according to the congressionally commissioned nonpartisan research agency Medicare Payment Advisory Council. Using default enrollment could increase that cost to an additional $2tn over 10 years, according to the left-leaning Center for American Progress.

Critics argue debates about \u201ceconomic incentives\u201d mask what are in fact \u201ccatastrophic\u201d health costs. Medicare Advantage plans are allowed to require patients to spend as much as $13,300 per year for out-of-network providers in 2024.

In the past 14 years, leaders have walked past these problems, created fictions, and I\u2019m not prepared to do that. We\u2019re going to fix the foundations. And having fixed the foundations, we\u2019re going to rebuild our country.\u201d He said there was light at the end of the tunnel for the public after the difficult decisions that would be made in the budget. \u201cWhat I want to be judged on is: one, have we made people better off? Do they feel better off under the Labour government, because we fixed the foundations? And secondly, that we genuinely get the NHS back up on its feet.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "More than 80 private schools closed every year in England on average over the last decade, official data has shown, with no apparent increase in the trend since Labour announced it was imposing VAT on fees. A number of media reports have highlighted the closure of some private schools as supposedly being caused by the policy, which is intended to raise money for more teachers in state schools. The Conservatives have also said it will lead to a rush of private school closures, increasing pressures on the state sector. Kemi Badenoch, the favourite to succeed Rishi Sunak as party leader, has said rescinding the policy would be the first thing she would do if she became prime minister. But data from a government register of private schools in England, collated in response to a parliamentary question tabled by the shadow education secretary, Damian Hinds, indicated that a churn in individual institutions is a longstanding trend. Since 1987, when data started to be collected, 2,583 schools have opened and 2,674 have shut. In the decade from 2013 to 2023, 847 schools closed \u2013 an average of nearly 85 a year. The 2024 data, which goes up to 6 October, shows that 46 schools have closed, slightly below the average trend, with 77 opening. While the Conservatives and the private school sector say that the real effects will be felt after the VAT is imposed from 1 January, the data seems to indicate that there has yet to be a notable impact despite a series of schools blaming closure on the prospect of the VAT imposition. The Daily Telegraph, which opposes the policy, has reported nine private schools closing since May which have cited the change. However, on the decade-long average, about seven schools a month would be expected to close anyway. A government source said: \u201cIndependent schools are evidently in rude health, despite the fearmongering of the private schools lobby and their Tory MP lackeys.

Graves reportedly swam out to the boy, brought him to safer waters, passed him off to a relative and instructed them to get back to shore.</p> <p>Family members realized something else was wrong when Graves didn\u2019t follow.

Belt recalled how \u201che loved them all\u201d, making it a point to dote on and travel with all of them particularly after retiring following his service in the US navy from 1968 to 1972 as well as his career at a power plant.</p> <p>\u201cHe just wanted all of his kids together all the time,\u201d Belt told WALA.</p> <p>According to the news station and his <a href=\"https://neptunesociety.com/obituaries/daphne-al/charles-graves-12025106\">obituary</a>, Graves had retired to Florida to spend his golden years soaking up the warmer weather there, participating in a vibrant pickleball scene and fishing.</p> <p>He planned in January to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his wedding to Maura Teasley Graves.</p> <p>Graves\u2019s obituary said his remains were being cremated, and his memory would be honored later at a celebration of life.</p>",

Loved ones of 75-year-old Charles \u201cChuck\u201d Graves told the Alabama news station WALA that his life\u2019s final act vividly demonstrated how important family was to him. \u201cThat was always the one thing,\u201d Graves\u2019s daughter-in-law, Valerie Belt, told the outlet. \u201cHe was definitely one of a kind.\u201d In a piece that went viral in digital circles dedicated to spotlighting stories of people helping others, WALA recounted how Graves \u2013 born and raised in Paducah, Kentucky, before moving to Estero, Florida \u2013 was visiting the beach vacation locale of Dauphin Island, Alabama, with relatives on 9 October. A current at one point swept Graves\u2019s five-year-old grandson into waters off the island, and he immediately dove in to try to help the child. Graves reportedly swam out to the boy, brought him to safer waters, passed him off to a relative and instructed them to get back to shore. Family members realized something else was wrong when Graves didn\u2019t follow. They initially feared he was drowning, and first responders pulled Graves out and flew him by helicopter to a hospital, the Alabama news station WPMI reported. Graves arrived to the hospital in critical condition, and his family later learned that he had endured a fatal heart attack after saving his grandson. \u201cWe think \u2026 Chuck already knew something was wrong or that something was happening because he never made an attempt to swim in, even though he was out of harm\u2019s way already,\u201d Belt said to WALA. \u201cThat\u2019s when we figured he was having the heart attack, which ultimately is what took him.\u201d Graves\u2019s survivors include a son, two daughters, four grandchildren and his wife, Maura. Belt recalled how \u201che loved them all\u201d, making it a point to dote on and travel with all of them particularly after retiring following his service in the US navy from 1968 to 1972 as well as his career at a power plant. \u201cHe just wanted all of his kids together all the time,\u201d Belt told WALA. According to the news station and his obituary, Graves had retired to Florida to spend his golden years soaking up the warmer weather there, participating in a vibrant pickleball scene and fishing. He planned in January to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his wedding to Maura Teasley Graves. Graves\u2019s obituary said his remains were being cremated, and his memory would be honored later at a celebration of life.",

A 1.5kW air fryer, for example, would cost 18p to run for 30 minutes.\u201d</p> <p>However, a conventional oven can be very useful when cooking for large gatherings that require the use of both shelves, she adds. \u201cGas is much cheaper than electricity, so a 2kW conventional gas oven would cost 11p if used for an hour, or 5p for a half hour. In general, a gas oven is likely to be cheaper to use than an air fryer, unless you\u2019re cooking a small amount of food for a short time.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Is it cheaper to boil the kettle to do the washing-up or use hot water from the tap?</strong></p> <p>The answer depends on whether your water heater is powered by gas or electricity and the amount of water being boiled. \u201cElectric kettles are generally more efficient at heating water than most hot water systems, so for smaller volumes of water this may work out cheaper, but don\u2019t scald yourself,\u201d Melville warns. \u201cFor larger volumes, a gas-powered water heater will be a more sensible choice, and you\u2019re likely using more water than a kettle can heat in one go.\u201d</p>    <p><strong>What is the most efficient way to use central heating? Set it at a lower temperature for longer</strong><strong> or at a higher one for less time? Should it come on first thing or keep the house warm overnight?</strong></p> <p>As temperatures drop, so begins the annual debate about when and how to use the central heating. The first step is to make sure your room thermostat is set to the right temperature, with most people opting for 18-21C. If you want to save money, reducing the temperature by 1C will save you about \u00a390 a year in Great Britain, according to the Energy Saving Trust, the social enterprise that offers advice on energy efficiency.</p> <p>It says that, in general, it is useful to have your heating come on half an hour before you get up and turn off 30 minutes before you go to bed. (Electric blankets are a good option to avoid putting on the heating at bedtime; many models have a timer.)</p>    <p>Is it more efficient to leave the heating on all day? If you have a boiler, then the answer is no. It is better for your bills to have it come on when you need it, the Energy Saving Trust says. However, if you have a heat pump, you can save money by leaving the heating on all day.</p> <p><strong>I keep seeing the \u201ceco mode\u201d on washing machines being touted as a great way to save money. But my eco cycle is locked at 40-60C and takes </strong><strong>more than three hours. My \u201cnormal\u201d wash cycle can be done as quickly as 70 minutes and I can turn the temperature off.

Using a cold water wash may work for some laundry, but you may need to use the eco mode for deeper cleaning.\u201d</p> <p><strong>I live in a 1910 semi-detached house with gas central heating.

The return of darker, colder nights also means that keeping energy costs down becomes a priority for many Britons.

At the White House he received a warm greeting in public, but privately officials responded skeptically to his \u201cvictory plan\u201d against the Russian invasion and refused to grant his request to use US-made missiles to strike targets deep inside of Russia.</p> <p>Then he met Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/27/trump-zelenskyy-meet-high-stakes-ukraine-talks-new-york\">who sought to humiliate Zelenskyy as he met him at Trump Tower</a> in a hastily-arranged summit at the tail end of a visit to the United Nations.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a very good relationship,\u201d Trump said as Zelenskyy looked on stoically. \u201cAnd I also have a very good relationship \u2013 as you know \u2013 with President Putin. And I think if we win, I think we\u2019re going to get it resolved very quickly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt takes two to tango, you know,\u201d Trump added.</p> <p>Meanwhile, diplomats from around the world continue to sit down with Trump and foreign policy thinkers rumoured to be tapped for his team, including with the authors of policy briefs from conservative think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation or the Trump-adjacent America First Policy Institute.</p> <p>\u201cCountries around the world are hedging and they have to be prepared for either outcome,\u201d said Andrew Weiss, vice-president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former director for Russian, Ukrainian and Eurasian Affairs on the national security council staff. \u201cThe Washington professional foreign policy establishment look at the possibility of Trump\u2019s return with great alarm. People know how chaotic his time in office was. They saw various foreign leaders wrap then President Trump around their finger. They saw how vulnerable and susceptible he was to calculations about personal self-interest and self-dealing, and how disinterested he was in preserving our alliances.\u201d</p> <p>A popular parlor game in Washington has been to predict who Trump could choose for his cabinet amongst a dwindling set of foreign policy experts still willing to work with him. Within the Republican party, there is a broader split between two camps supporting Trump: those who think that US should embrace a muscular, hawkish foreign policy traditional to Republicans, and those who believe that the US should occupy a more isolationist position.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not going to be the world\u2019s policeman,\u201d said Elbridge Colby, a deputy assistant secretary of defense during the first Trump administration, in an interview this week with the New York Times. \u201cWe have to understand that, because for the first time in more than a century, we are not clearly the world\u2019s largest economy. And we\u2019re definitely not the world\u2019s largest industrial power.\u201d</p> <p>With Israel expanding its war into Lebanon in the weeks before the election, there is considerable doubt that the White House under Harris or Trump will be prepared to meaningfully rein in Benjamin Netanyahu and find a diplomatic solution to the conflict.</p> <p>\u201cI think America is weak,\u201d said Yossi Melman, an Israeli journalist who specialises in security affairs, and is co-author of Spies Against Armageddon: Inside Israel\u2019s Secret Wars. \u201cAmerica is losing its influence.\u201d</p> <p>Washington under Biden was unable to compel either Iran or Israel to the table, he said. A Trump presidency would be \u201cextremely unpredictable\u201d, he added, but although Trump had suggested he would allow Israel to \u201cfinish what they started\u201d, his own troubled relationship with Netanyahu could interfere.</p> <p>\u201cHis record is not very pro-Israeli in the Netanyahu sense,\u201d said Melman. \u201cI\u2019m not ruling out that if [Trump] is a player, then he would just say: \u2018Fuck off.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, there is considerable skepticism that a Harris administration would meaningfully alter Biden\u2019s policy of support for Israel even while attempting to broker a ceasefire. The vice-president has spoken out more forcefully on her sympathy for the plight of Palestinians, but at the same time she has rejected a potential arms embargo against Israel that could be used to put diplomatic pressure on the Netanyahu administration.</p> <p>\u201cIf Trump is elected, Netanyahu\u2019s margin for maneuver will expand,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, focusing on US foreign policy in the Middle East. \u201cIf Harris wins. I don\u2019t see much of a change in US policy anywhere\u2026 it\u2019s hard to imagine, unless there are ready made opportunities, not just crises, that you know she\u2019s going to be prepared to wade in any in a way that\u2019s different than Biden.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a pattern that has repeated itself with the US relationship with Israel for decades now. Miller recalled when Barack Obama entered office in 2009 that he was told by an official that this time was \u201cgoing to be different.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis person said, you\u2019ll see, particularly with Israel, he\u2019s not going to deal with Netanyahu the same way,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see it\u2019ll be tougher. It\u2019ll be stronger. None of it happened and I doubt any of it\u2019s going to happen now.\u201d</p> <p>As those conflicts rage on, a number of prominent Republicans have called for the US to refocus its attention toward China, with some saying Trump should divert resources from the conflicts both in Russia and in the Middle East toward controlling China\u2019s rise.</p> <p>\u201cThe existential threats to America, to our existence, to our kids, how they live, to our grandkids, come from one place. It\u2019s the Chinese Communist party in Beijing. It\u2019s Xi Jinping and his ambitions,\u201d said Robert O\u2019Brien, Trump\u2019s former national security advisor who is said to be seeking a position in a potential Trump administration.</p> <p>Some foreign officials have said that the potential for pedigreed officials such as O\u2019Brien to return to a potential Trump administration could help control his unpredictability.</p> <p>But new reporting has suggested that Trump has been freelancing his own foreign policy, carrying on private conversations with foreign leaders such as Putin in the years when he was out of the Oval Office. The Wall Street Journal this week reported that Elon Musk, a prominent Trump surrogate who has become his largest donor, has been in \u201cregular contact\u201d with Putin since late 2022. At one point, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/musk-putin-secret-conversations-37e1c187?st=jNT5Ur\">Putin reportedly asked Musk</a> not to turn on his Starlink satellite network over Taiwan as a personal favour to Xi Jinping.

Because he seems bent on being his real self, as opposed to the version that was hemmed in by traditionalists when he came into office.\u201d</p>",

Thiem had certainly paid his dues. He had already reached three major finals, losing to Rafael Nadal twice at the French Open and Novak Djokovic in Australia. Despite the new doubts that followed those defeats, he came back stronger every time. Finally, at his fourth attempt, the odds were in his favour.</p> <p>\u201cThe emotions were great,\u201d says Thiem, smiling, as he recounts the aftermath of that semi-final from a cosy room inside Vienna\u2019s Wiener Stadthalle this week. \u201cGreat dinner, great treatment. Everything was fine. But then, already going to sleep after the semis, I felt like: \u2018OK, I\u2019m really tight. <em>Shit.</em> I cannot think about anything else other than the final, which is not good.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Instead of a straightforward victory for Thiem against Alexander Zverev, chaos reigned. In the blink of an eye, a painfully tight Thiem found himself trailing by two sets. Then, after recovering to force a final set, he stood two points from defeat on Zverev\u2019s serve. By the time Thiem had dragged himself into a final set tie-break, the drama peaking after four hours inside an empty, eerily quiet Arthur Ashe Stadium due to strict Covid protocols, he could barely even walk. Somehow, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/13/us-open-mens-final-2020-dominic-thiem-alexander-zverev\">he held on to win</a>.</p> <p>Not only was this a career-defining moment for Thiem, it was a significant occasion in the recent history of men\u2019s tennis. After so many years of Djokovic, Nadal and Roger Federer wiping out all young challengers, Thiem represented the first crack in their collective armour, the first male player born in the 1990s or beyond to win a grand slam title. Four years on, Medvedev remains the only other 90s-born champion. It seemed as if Thiem had only just reached his peak and would continue to challenge for major titles.</p> <p>The greatest moment of Thiem\u2019s career, instead, turned out to be the beginning of the end. On Tuesday, Thiem retired from professional tennis at 31 years old after losing 7-6 (6), 6-2 to Luciano Darderi on home soil in the first round of the Vienna Open.</p>    <p>It has been a decade since Thiem emerged on the ATP tour, a talented player who was slightly slower to catch fire than some of his peers. He boasted such a brutally physical playing style from the beginning, launching himself into every single stroke and veering between generating wicked, heavy topspin with his forehand and his unforgettable single-handed backhand; battering opponents with his explosive shotmaking from all parts of the&nbsp;court.</p> <p>His approach to the sport, however, was even more striking. Alongside his initial coach, G\u00fcnter Bresnik, Thiem quickly became known for his tireless work ethic. His schedule was relentless. He played week after week, rarely ever coming up for air. Between matches, his training regime was similarly unforgiving.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way I grew up, this training style with a lot of intensity and really giving it 100% every single shot,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was physically very demanding. And also, from a very early age, I got used to high-volume practice, practising like three four hours straight, or three hours twice [a day].\u201d</p> <p>For Thiem, that work ethic was a non-negotiable part of his career, one of the pillars of his success. But it is also ultimately what caused his demise. Having spent his entire career working towards winning a grand slam title, upon scaling that mountain, his efforts quickly caught up with him. By the beginning of 2021, Thiem was physically and mentally burned out. Then, just as he had rediscovered his motivation and drive, his body crumbled. At the Mallorca Open in June 2021, nine months after New York, Thiem badly injured his wrist while reaching for a forehand.</p> <p>\u201cThe last couple of years, it was so difficult to keep up with that [high] volume,\u201d he says. \u201cThe wrist was not able to hold up with that volume of practice, and also the other parts of the body got older and older.\u201d</p>    <p>Over the past few years, as Thiem toiled to rediscover his form of old, he largely spent his time chasing shadows. As he came to terms with his injury that few players recover from, Thiem had to accept his&nbsp;situation.</p> <p>\u201cI think the way we do the sport, it\u2019s not healthy, and at one point, one part or more parts of the body break down,\u201d says Thiem. \u201cYou can see it with almost every player, there is no player who comes injury free through their career. That\u2019s just the way of professional sport. And in my case, it was the wrist. It\u2019s&nbsp;not really surprising, because I was obviously using the wrist so much, especially at the forehand, and it was one of my most important parts the last moments before hitting the ball to accelerate a bit more with the wrist.

      "body": "<p>On the morning of 30 November 2022, Keri-Sue McManus sat down with her three-year-old son, Micah, to watch the TV series Daniel Tiger\u2019s Neighborhood. A preschool animation about a tiger cub, the show sets out to teach life lessons. That day, Keri-Sue chose a specific episode, Daniel Goes to the Hospital, for a reason. She planned to take Micah to hospital and was using the cartoon to reassure him that everything would be OK.</p> <p>She was sensitive to his mood because it wasn\u2019t the first time Micah had visited the emergency room in recent weeks. In fact, it was the third time Keri-Sue had taken her toddler to hospital, and the sixth time that month she had contacted various doctors about his deterioration: he had a lack of appetite, weakness, fatigue and severe dizziness, and these symptoms were getting worse.</p> <p>Each time, she was reassured he would get better. One medic even implied that their frequent visits to the hospital were giving her son anxiety. It was suggested the mother should think twice about taking him in again, for his own sake \u2013 hence the cartoon.</p> <p>In the Daniel Tiger episode, the cub, nervously approaching his appointment, is told: \u201cThe hospital is a place where doctors and nurses work together to help you get better.\u201d But that\u2019s not the way it worked out for Micah, who died just hours after he arrived on this third visit, after a series of clinicians failed to take his condition seriously.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve relived all those moments a thousand times. What if I\u2019d gone to this doctor; what if I\u2019d said it this way instead of that way</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cDaniel goes to hospital and the doctors fix him and everybody\u2019s so nice. And then he gets to go home,\u201d Keri-Sue remembers of the cartoon. \u201cIt\u2019s like a fairytale that we didn\u2019t get to live out.\u201d</p> <p>Micah\u2019s story casts light on how parents, especially mothers, are frequently patronised and dismissed by the medical profession. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any other way to describe it besides gaslighting,\u201d Keri-Sue says when we speak. \u201cIt\u2019s your own child, so you get a feeling or you notice something. You know your child\u2019s normal state better than anybody else and you\u2019re paying attention more than anybody else. I\u2019ve relived all those moments a thousand times. What if I\u2019d gone to <em>this</em> doctor; what if I\u2019d said it <em>this</em> way instead of <em>that</em> way. But the reality is that they weren\u2019t paying attention and doing their job.</p> <p>\u201cPart of my grief has been trying to wrap my head around how it all happened.\u201d</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>When she was 24, Keri-Sue lived in Spain for a year. Out shopping one day, she saw a cute bedroom sign that said <em>Mi habitaci\u00f3n</em> (My room) with a little boy riding a horse. \u201cI bought it and said, \u2018I\u2019m gonna have a son someday, and he\u2019s gonna hang this in his room.\u2019\u201d The sign is still hanging there when I talk to Keri-Sue, two days before what should have been Micah\u2019s fifth birthday.</p> <p>Micah was Keri-Sue\u2019s first child with her husband, Dan. \u201cI was so excited. I knew immediately, I just had this feeling when I found out I was pregnant that it was a boy.\u201d She had only been pregnant a couple of weeks when they chose his name.</p> <p>The family lived a charmed life on a farm two hours north of New York City. Weekenders are drawn to the area\u2019s natural beauty, with the Hudson River cutting through the valley and the Catskill mountains close by. In 2020, when Covid hit, there was an influx of people looking for a taste of the bucolic life.</p> <p>Their farm grows 200 crops, mostly organic vegetables, that they sell at farmers\u2019 markets and to retail stores. Micah loved the lifestyle. \u201cHe was so proud of it. Everywhere we went, he\u2019d say, \u2018I have a farm.\u2019 I wondered at the time if he thought everybody had a farm, because when kids are small it\u2019s like, that\u2019s their only point of reference.\u201d Micah would feed the chickens and collect the eggs. He loved watering their garden and planting and picking flowers. \u201cWe have a farm crew, and he would pick flowers and then walk around the field and give them out to the crew. He loved making people happy; if he saw something got a really positive reaction, he would do it again.\u201d Keri-Sue watched her son grow up quickly. She would occasionally try to freeze a moment, to make sure she was fully aware of her good fortune.</p>    <p>On 14 October 2022, Keri-Sue and Dan were due to be married. But their son, who had turned three just 12 days before, woke them up in the night, burning with fever. The wedding was set to be a low-key event \u2013 just the couple and two friends who were witnesses; they were hoping Micah could join them after the ceremony. Instead, they rushed home to be with him as he lay lethargically on the couch. The next day the doctor told them that he had Covid, and, while the fever went away after a week, the toddler never fully bounced back. His mother watched the pulse in his neck, drumming against the skin.</p> <p>Micah\u2019s primary-care doctor told Keri-Sue the elevated pulse was nothing to worry about, just swollen glands, a vestige of Covid. But Micah, who had grown out of napping, had begun to doze off during the day. He didn\u2019t have the energy to return to his local playgroup. A few times Keri-Sue tried to take him there, but he looked like he might fall asleep in the back of the car, so she aborted each trip. Besides, knowing how playgroups are hotbeds for viruses, she wanted to make sure he was better before she exposed him to any more illnesses.</p> <p>Micah never went back. He stayed home for weeks, summoning up the energy to play in the leaves and dress as a cowboy for Halloween. But at the start of November he came down with RSV (respiratory syncytial virus). Although common, RSV was particularly virulent that year because it hadn\u2019t been circulating as much during the lockdown years.</p> <p>Both Micah and his baby sister, Chloe, coughed their way through the week, but while Chloe, who was two years his junior, soon regained her vitality, Micah became weaker and weaker. He didn\u2019t want to eat. He didn\u2019t want to play. His doctor gave him antibiotics, having suggested that he had a lingering sinus infection from Covid, and that some kids just take longer to recover. But his mother remained concerned.</p> <p>By mid-November, Micah was still barely eating and wouldn\u2019t even watch TV, so for the first time Keri-Sue drove her son an hour to the Albany medical center hospital. Despite his elevated pulse, he didn\u2019t even make it past the triage room and Keri-Sue was told to follow up with his regular doctor.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Part of me wanted to believe them that I was making him anxious and overreacting, because I wanted him to get better</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She says she didn\u2019t have much luck with his regular doctor, either. \u201cI feel like he was just kind of stringing me along. He was like, \u2018Kids just take a while to get better. You need to have patience.\u2019 The whole vibe was that I was giving him anxiety and not allowing the natural process of the illness to take place.\u201d Micah himself tried to articulate the dizziness that he was experiencing: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m going to fall down,\u201d he kept saying.</p> <p>The call logs from the time show Keri-Sue was phoning the doctor every few days. \u201cI was like, \u2018He still won\u2019t eat. I don\u2019t know what to do. Should I bring him back to the hospital?\u2019 And they just kept saying to give it more time.\u201d At one point, the receptionist said pointedly: \u201cI knew you would call \u2013 you call every day!\u201d Keri-Sue was made to feel like an irritating mother who didn\u2019t know when to give it a rest. But, naturally, she deferred to the clinicians. \u201cPart of me wanted to believe them that I was making him anxious and overreacting, because I wanted him to get better. So if they said, \u2018He\u2019s fine, he just needs a few more days,\u2019 I\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh, OK, good.\u2019\u201d She was reassured.</p> <p>By now a month had passed since Micah had become ill. During that period, the whole family had been sick twice, but Micah was the only one who had never got better. He refused to walk, and was increasingly frail, so Keri-Sue started having to carry him around. On 23 November, 10 days after their first visit, she took him to hospital for the second time.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve replayed this scene a million times, because it didn\u2019t have to go this way,\u201d Keri-Sue says. She remembers the resident doctor being cold and accusatory: \u201c\u2018Why are you bringing him here? You just brought him here.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Right, but he\u2019s just not getting better. He\u2019s not eating. He won\u2019t walk. He\u2019s pale, he\u2019s tired, he seems winded to me.\u2019 I told them everything, and she really gave me a hard time, to the point that I actually started to cry.\u201d</p> <p>Keri-Sue tried to explain: \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that I\u2019m wrong, but I wouldn\u2019t have brought him here unless I really was worried.\u201d The doctors carried out some examinations: they checked for any rash and listened to Micah\u2019s chest with a stethoscope. He was given anti-nausea medicine, which allowed him to drink some apple juice and eat a saltine cracker. And then he was discharged. As they were leaving, Keri-Sue remembers a doctor saying: \u201cYou know, he\u2019s probably anxious you keep bringing him to the hospital.\u201d They advised the mother \u201cnot to bring him for a while and let him get better at home\u201d. The paperwork for this visit states: \u201cMicah may be experiencing some stress related to having recently been ill.\u201d</p>    <p>At home, Micah became clingy, telling his mother over and over again that he loved her. \u201cIf I left for any amount of time, I\u2019d come back and he\u2019d say, \u2018I missed you so much, Mama. I love you so much.\u2019\u201d Keri-Sue stopped working on the farm in order to dedicate all her time to her son\u2019s recovery. She took to heart the doctor\u2019s advice, and started playing them both meditation tapes. \u201cI was just trying to do whatever we could to relax. But he wasn\u2019t getting better.\u201d He was listless. When he ate, he only wanted to do so lying down. He still talked about the sensation of falling.</p> <p>On 29 November, Keri-Sue called her regular doctor\u2019s office again, begging them to squeeze Micah in for an appointment. She had stayed up all night Googling, writing down possible causes of her son\u2019s illness, including liver problems, long Covid, inflammation of the heart \u2026</p> <p>\u201cI said we need to be more thorough, and went down a long list. And every single one of them, he was just like, \u2018No, no, that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. Kids are not getting long Covid. No, it\u2019s not anything with his heart, or his fingers would be blue. No, it\u2019s not his liver.\u2019 When we left, I had been given a prescription for an allergy medicine.\u201d</p> <p>Unsatisfied, Keri-Sue called her doctor again later that day to request an echocardiogram, a scan of the heart and nearby blood vessels. She says she was told it wasn\u2019t necessary. She couldn\u2019t sleep. \u201cI just had a horrible feeling.\u201d In the middle of the night, Micah got up to pee, and said, \u2018Ow\u2019. He pointed to his abdomen as the source of pain. \u201cI knew it was his heart or liver. I just knew.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I stood there in this tiny little room while person after person gave my son CPR. I was just pacing around saying, \u2018Micah, I\u2019m here. I\u2019m here\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That third time at the hospital, everything seemed chaotic, and the staff appeared to be overwhelmed. (Albany medical center hospital <a href=\"https://www.timesunion.com/projects/2024/er-visits-searchable-map/\">reportedly has some of the longest ER waiting times for adults in the US</a>.)</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t get a response from anyone and you don\u2019t feel like you get to talk to the same person twice,\u201d Keri-Sue says. Finally, an ultrasound was ordered for Micah\u2019s abdomen. Keri-Sue sang Hush Little Baby to her son and tried to keep her eyes off the screen.</p> <p>The ultrasound technician finished the scan and wished them luck. \u201cI just kept saying, \u2018They\u2019re gonna help you, they\u2019re gonna help you. These people are so nice.\u2019 They weren\u2019t even being that nice,\u201d Keri-Sue recalls, \u201cbut I just kept saying it because I really wanted to make him feel safe.\u201d</p> <p>She started recounting stories from when she was young. \u201cI told him how my parents, my brothers and I went to Cape Cod for the weekend. Our car broke down on the side of the road and we had to hitchhike there. I was scared because we were standing on the side of the highway. But these people with a tow truck came and picked us up, and saved the day. So we made it and we were fine and happy. I was trying to create this analogy of how something scary can happen, but then it turns out OK.\u201d</p> <p>Dan joined them in the hospital; the hours passed as they waited for the ultrasound results. Occasionally, someone would pop their head in the door and say, \u201cHas anyone come to see you yet?\u201d and disappear. Eventually, the doctors confirmed Micah had an enlarged heart and blood clots on his liver. From her earlier Googling, Keri-Sue knew straight away he needed blood thinners, but the clinicians said they wanted to do more tests and start treatment in the morning. At this point, it was early evening, and the family, who had been at the hospital all day, worried about letting another night slip by. They were reassured: \u201cWe have a whole team of doctors that are working on this, and this is really treatable stuff and he\u2019s very stable right now.\u201d</p>    <p>Admitted to stay overnight, they were kept waiting in a cubicle in the ER. Keri-Sue lay next to her son hugging him as he slept. At around 8pm, a nurse came to take observations and put fluid in his IV. Within minutes, Micah woke and started gasping. His eyes turned yellow and, though he hadn\u2019t needed to pee all day, he urinated across the bed. Keri-Sue ran into the hallway yelling that something was wrong. Some of the nurses hurried in, under the impression that the problem was that he had peed. \u201cThey offered to get him a diaper and I\u2019m like, \u2018No, something is wrong. Look at my kid, he\u2019s gasping for breath.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>And then, suddenly, after being ignored for weeks, Micah and his family had a throng of people surrounding them. The doctors put him on oxygen, but his heart rate was plummeting. They called a code blue, the signal for a cardiac arrest, and started CPR.</p> <p>\u201cI stood there in this tiny little room while person after person gave my son CPR. For about an hour and a half he looked like he was dead or dying. I was just pacing around saying, \u2018Micah, I\u2019m here. I\u2019m here.\u2019 At one point, they said: \u2018You should leave the room.\u2019 So we did. We went to the room next door and just stood there asking ourselves: <em>What has happened? How is this real?</em>\u201d</p> <p>A blood clot had travelled to Micah\u2019s lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism. His heart had stopped beating and they couldn\u2019t revive him. Nothing could be done. They put Micah in his mother\u2019s arms and started counting. One, two, three \u2026 when they reached 60 they declared him dead.</p> <p>Keri-Sue and Dan knew they couldn\u2019t just sit there for hours with their son\u2019s lifeless body, but at the same time they couldn\u2019t fathom leaving without it. One of the staff offered to push Keri-Sue out to their car in a wheelchair. But, eventually, they walked through the waiting room and out into the cold night air, passing lines of children with their parents on the way.</p> <p>Apart from receiving a small clay imprint of their son\u2019s hand, taken after he died, they had no further communication from the hospital. There was no explanation, there were no condolences. They simply never heard from them again.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Keri-Sue contacted me after reading in the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/sep/03/13-year-old-daughter-dead-in-five-weeks-hospital-mistakes\">the story of my daughter Martha</a>, who died, aged 13, of septic shock as a result of medical negligence. We live on different continents, in countries with different healthcare systems; our children were different ages and died from different illnesses. But we have this in common: we tried to raise the alarm about our child\u2019s deteriorating condition and we were condescended to and ignored.</p> <p>So when Keri-Sue describes how she plays these memories over and over, willing a different outcome; when she says that \u201cpart of me never left the hospital, is still living that moment, hoping things change\u201d, I know exactly how she feels.</p> <p>\u201cIt was so similar to what happened with you,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was a lot of time and a lot of opportunities for doctors to take it seriously.\u201d</p> <p>Martha was an inpatient at King\u2019s College hospital (KCH) in London. In our case, key bits of information about my daughter\u2019s condition \u2013 details that would have helped me advocate for her \u2013 were held back because they saw me as a problematically anxious mother.</p> <p>Although KCH policy states that parental concern should prompt discussions about a critical care review or a move to intensive care, with Martha the doctors decided <em>not</em> to arrange this potentially life-saving intervention on the basis that it would increase my anxiety.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/sep/03/13-year-old-daughter-dead-in-five-weeks-hospital-mistakes\">\u2018We had such trust, we feel such fools\u2019: how shocking hospital mistakes led to our daughter\u2019s death</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Much has been written about the diagnostic value of parental concern in medical literature. Paediatric doctors-in-training are taught to \u201clisten to the mother and father, they know the patient better than anyone\u201d. But that\u2019s rarely how it plays out. Doctors too often regard parents\u2019 involvement as a problem rather than a vital contribution: the family hasn\u2019t had years of training; in a hospital they have no status and are treated as though they know nothing.</p> <p>And, too frequently, a well-intentioned instinct to put a parent\u2019s mind at ease can inadvertently cause a doctor to reassure <em>themselves</em>. In post-death investigations into what went wrong in Martha\u2019s care, my husband and I were asked a memorable question: \u201cWere you reassured by the doctors?\u201d The problem, of course, was that we were falsely reassured \u2013 and not <em>listened</em> to.</p> <p>On 29 November 2022, 24 hours before Micah died, 13-year-old Chloe Longster was admitted to hospital in Kettering in the English Midlands. She had been suffering from severe chest pain, a cough and other cold-like symptoms before her condition rapidly developed into sepsis. Her mother, Louise, tells me she was with her the whole time. \u201cI felt like I had to try and convince them that she was poorly.\u201d Echoing Keri-Sue, she says: \u201cIt was like they were trying to gaslight us.\u201d</p> <p>This month, a coroner ruled that a hospital\u2019s neglect contributed to Chloe\u2019s death. There were numerous missed opportunities for sepsis screening and treatment. \u201cI really believe Chloe died because there is a pervasive belief that parents are an irritant and they\u2019re wrong,\u201d Louise says.</p> <p>In cases such as Micah\u2019s, a doctor\u2019s counter-argument might be that the vast majority of children they see who have non-specific symptoms like his do get better. Unfortunately, children often exhibit symptoms of serious illness in different ways from adults.</p> <p>Ron Daniels is an intensive care consultant and CEO of the UK Sepsis Trust. He notes: \u201cChildren can compensate for illness longer than adults can. In the case of sepsis, a child can increase their heart rate to a greater degree than an adult, which means they sometimes don\u2019t appear really sick until very late in the day \u2013 at which point they need very urgent intervention.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s a fear that if we empower people we\u2019ll be overrun by hypochondriacs and time-wasters. But most good doctors know that\u2019s not the case</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Equally important is that children communicate differently. \u201cOddly, they are more stoical than adults, and less likely to make a fuss.\u201d Younger children especially perceive pain and discomfort in ways not always obvious to doctors. \u201cWhich means we have to listen to the experts, which in this case is the parents or carers, who just <em>know</em> when their child is seriously unwell.\u201d</p> <p>Daniels accepts that whatever doctors are taught in med school, listening to parents remains a challenge in practice. \u201cThere\u2019s a fear that if we empower people we\u2019ll be overrun by hypochondriacs and time-wasters. But most good doctors know that\u2019s not the case. No one wants to spend a lot of time in A&amp;E or a hospital ward, because they\u2019re not pleasant places to be.\u201d</p> <p>Or as Louise Longster puts it: \u201cChloe had never been to hospital. We\u2019re not those kinds of people. Who sits in A&amp;E for hours on end voluntarily?\u201d</p> <p>Which suggests those parents who <em>do</em> keep pushing deserve to have their fears taken seriously, especially if, like Keri-Sue and Dan, they don\u2019t have a long history of repeatedly contacting a doctor.</p> <p>This is the reason I have campaigned for Martha\u2019s Rule, a patient safety initiative that allows patients, families and junior staff to trigger a rapid review if they have concerns about a patient\u2019s deterioration. Martha\u2019s Rule is being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/may/27/marthas-rule-143-nhs-hospitals-in-england\">introduced at 143 hospitals in England</a>. Micah\u2019s story confirms, however, that a poor listening culture is not a problem unique to the NHS: giving patients and their families more power to raise an alarm is something that needs to happen in healthcare systems around the world.</p>    <p>As it stands, the McManuses have filed a lawsuit against Albany Med Health System for negligence and failing to perform the necessary diagnostic tests. (When approached for comment about Micah\u2019s care, a spokesperson said: \u201c We cannot comment on pending legal matters.\u201d) They are also campaigning to introduce the <a href=\"https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/06/03/grieving-families-act-third-time-vetoed-bill/\">Grieving Families Act</a>, which argues that New York state law inadequately compensates families like them who lose children because of medical malpractice.</p> <p>New York is one of just two states that place little value on the life of a child who doesn\u2019t contribute economically. (The law is similar in the UK, where only negligible compensation is ever given to parents after a child\u2019s death from medical mistakes. I recall one legal firm\u2019s website suggesting that, owing to the high cost of raising children these days, there\u2019s an argument that parents are in fact <em>better off</em> once their child is dead.)</p> <p>Naturally, money is of little consequence when it comes to the avoidable death of a child, but there\u2019s something about a lack of accountability and recompense that feels like an affront. As Keri-Sue says: \u201cThis is not the tragedy to me. The tragedy is that I lost my son. The [resistance to the] Grieving Families Act just makes me feel like my tragedy doesn\u2019t matter much to New York.\u201d</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Flicking through old photographs these days, Keri-Sue finds herself looking for signs of what was to come. \u201cI feel like a murder-mystery detective. Since he died, I\u2019m trying to find clues. But there is nothing to find. I guess I\u2019m just looking for anything; looking for evidence of <em>him</em>.\u201d</p> <p>The McManuses have turned part of their farm into a memorial garden for Micah. It is full of colour \u2013 lots of sunflowers and zinnias and cosmos. Keri-Sue says she has decided to plant mostly annuals there, which complete their life cycle in one growing season, from germination to flowering, setting seed and dying. Annuals have a shorter lifespan, but they bloom consistently and when they flower they are bright, beautiful, unmissable.</p> <p>\u201cThey remind me of Micah,\u201d she says. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t here very long. But while he was here, he was in full bloom.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Merope Mills is editor of the Guardian\u2019s Saturday magazine</p>",

      "bodyText": "On the morning of 30 November 2022, Keri-Sue McManus sat down with her three-year-old son, Micah, to watch the TV series Daniel Tiger\u2019s Neighborhood. A preschool animation about a tiger cub, the show sets out to teach life lessons. That day, Keri-Sue chose a specific episode, Daniel Goes to the Hospital, for a reason. She planned to take Micah to hospital and was using the cartoon to reassure him that everything would be OK. She was sensitive to his mood because it wasn\u2019t the first time Micah had visited the emergency room in recent weeks. In fact, it was the third time Keri-Sue had taken her toddler to hospital, and the sixth time that month she had contacted various doctors about his deterioration: he had a lack of appetite, weakness, fatigue and severe dizziness, and these symptoms were getting worse. Each time, she was reassured he would get better. One medic even implied that their frequent visits to the hospital were giving her son anxiety. It was suggested the mother should think twice about taking him in again, for his own sake \u2013 hence the cartoon. In the Daniel Tiger episode, the cub, nervously approaching his appointment, is told: \u201cThe hospital is a place where doctors and nurses work together to help you get better.\u201d But that\u2019s not the way it worked out for Micah, who died just hours after he arrived on this third visit, after a series of clinicians failed to take his condition seriously. \u201cDaniel goes to hospital and the doctors fix him and everybody\u2019s so nice. And then he gets to go home,\u201d Keri-Sue remembers of the cartoon. \u201cIt\u2019s like a fairytale that we didn\u2019t get to live out.\u201d Micah\u2019s story casts light on how parents, especially mothers, are frequently patronised and dismissed by the medical profession. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any other way to describe it besides gaslighting,\u201d Keri-Sue says when we speak. \u201cIt\u2019s your own child, so you get a feeling or you notice something. You know your child\u2019s normal state better than anybody else and you\u2019re paying attention more than anybody else. I\u2019ve relived all those moments a thousand times. What if I\u2019d gone to this doctor; what if I\u2019d said it this way instead of that way. But the reality is that they weren\u2019t paying attention and doing their job. \u201cPart of my grief has been trying to wrap my head around how it all happened.\u201d * * * When she was 24, Keri-Sue lived in Spain for a year. Out shopping one day, she saw a cute bedroom sign that said Mi habitaci\u00f3n (My room) with a little boy riding a horse. \u201cI bought it and said, \u2018I\u2019m gonna have a son someday, and he\u2019s gonna hang this in his room.\u2019\u201d The sign is still hanging there when I talk to Keri-Sue, two days before what should have been Micah\u2019s fifth birthday. Micah was Keri-Sue\u2019s first child with her husband, Dan. \u201cI was so excited. I knew immediately, I just had this feeling when I found out I was pregnant that it was a boy.\u201d She had only been pregnant a couple of weeks when they chose his name. The family lived a charmed life on a farm two hours north of New York City. Weekenders are drawn to the area\u2019s natural beauty, with the Hudson River cutting through the valley and the Catskill mountains close by. In 2020, when Covid hit, there was an influx of people looking for a taste of the bucolic life. Their farm grows 200 crops, mostly organic vegetables, that they sell at farmers\u2019 markets and to retail stores. Micah loved the lifestyle. \u201cHe was so proud of it. Everywhere we went, he\u2019d say, \u2018I have a farm.\u2019 I wondered at the time if he thought everybody had a farm, because when kids are small it\u2019s like, that\u2019s their only point of reference.\u201d Micah would feed the chickens and collect the eggs. He loved watering their garden and planting and picking flowers. \u201cWe have a farm crew, and he would pick flowers and then walk around the field and give them out to the crew. He loved making people happy; if he saw something got a really positive reaction, he would do it again.\u201d Keri-Sue watched her son grow up quickly. She would occasionally try to freeze a moment, to make sure she was fully aware of her good fortune. On 14 October 2022, Keri-Sue and Dan were due to be married. But their son, who had turned three just 12 days before, woke them up in the night, burning with fever. The wedding was set to be a low-key event \u2013 just the couple and two friends who were witnesses; they were hoping Micah could join them after the ceremony. Instead, they rushed home to be with him as he lay lethargically on the couch. The next day the doctor told them that he had Covid, and, while the fever went away after a week, the toddler never fully bounced back. His mother watched the pulse in his neck, drumming against the skin. Micah\u2019s primary-care doctor told Keri-Sue the elevated pulse was nothing to worry about, just swollen glands, a vestige of Covid. But Micah, who had grown out of napping, had begun to doze off during the day. He didn\u2019t have the energy to return to his local playgroup. A few times Keri-Sue tried to take him there, but he looked like he might fall asleep in the back of the car, so she aborted each trip. Besides, knowing how playgroups are hotbeds for viruses, she wanted to make sure he was better before she exposed him to any more illnesses. Micah never went back. He stayed home for weeks, summoning up the energy to play in the leaves and dress as a cowboy for Halloween. But at the start of November he came down with RSV (respiratory syncytial virus). Although common, RSV was particularly virulent that year because it hadn\u2019t been circulating as much during the lockdown years. Both Micah and his baby sister, Chloe, coughed their way through the week, but while Chloe, who was two years his junior, soon regained her vitality, Micah became weaker and weaker. He didn\u2019t want to eat. He didn\u2019t want to play. His doctor gave him antibiotics, having suggested that he had a lingering sinus infection from Covid, and that some kids just take longer to recover. But his mother remained concerned. By mid-November, Micah was still barely eating and wouldn\u2019t even watch TV, so for the first time Keri-Sue drove her son an hour to the Albany medical center hospital. Despite his elevated pulse, he didn\u2019t even make it past the triage room and Keri-Sue was told to follow up with his regular doctor. She says she didn\u2019t have much luck with his regular doctor, either. \u201cI feel like he was just kind of stringing me along. He was like, \u2018Kids just take a while to get better. You need to have patience.\u2019 The whole vibe was that I was giving him anxiety and not allowing the natural process of the illness to take place.\u201d Micah himself tried to articulate the dizziness that he was experiencing: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m going to fall down,\u201d he kept saying. The call logs from the time show Keri-Sue was phoning the doctor every few days. \u201cI was like, \u2018He still won\u2019t eat. I don\u2019t know what to do. Should I bring him back to the hospital?\u2019 And they just kept saying to give it more time.\u201d At one point, the receptionist said pointedly: \u201cI knew you would call \u2013 you call every day!\u201d Keri-Sue was made to feel like an irritating mother who didn\u2019t know when to give it a rest. But, naturally, she deferred to the clinicians. \u201cPart of me wanted to believe them that I was making him anxious and overreacting, because I wanted him to get better. So if they said, \u2018He\u2019s fine, he just needs a few more days,\u2019 I\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh, OK, good.\u2019\u201d She was reassured. By now a month had passed since Micah had become ill. During that period, the whole family had been sick twice, but Micah was the only one who had never got better. He refused to walk, and was increasingly frail, so Keri-Sue started having to carry him around. On 23 November, 10 days after their first visit, she took him to hospital for the second time. \u201cI\u2019ve replayed this scene a million times, because it didn\u2019t have to go this way,\u201d Keri-Sue says. She remembers the resident doctor being cold and accusatory: \u201c\u2018Why are you bringing him here? You just brought him here.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Right, but he\u2019s just not getting better. He\u2019s not eating. He won\u2019t walk. He\u2019s pale, he\u2019s tired, he seems winded to me.\u2019 I told them everything, and she really gave me a hard time, to the point that I actually started to cry.\u201d Keri-Sue tried to explain: \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that I\u2019m wrong, but I wouldn\u2019t have brought him here unless I really was worried.\u201d The doctors carried out some examinations: they checked for any rash and listened to Micah\u2019s chest with a stethoscope. He was given anti-nausea medicine, which allowed him to drink some apple juice and eat a saltine cracker. And then he was discharged. As they were leaving, Keri-Sue remembers a doctor saying: \u201cYou know, he\u2019s probably anxious you keep bringing him to the hospital.\u201d They advised the mother \u201cnot to bring him for a while and let him get better at home\u201d. The paperwork for this visit states: \u201cMicah may be experiencing some stress related to having recently been ill.\u201d At home, Micah became clingy, telling his mother over and over again that he loved her. \u201cIf I left for any amount of time, I\u2019d come back and he\u2019d say, \u2018I missed you so much, Mama. I love you so much.\u2019\u201d Keri-Sue stopped working on the farm in order to dedicate all her time to her son\u2019s recovery. She took to heart the doctor\u2019s advice, and started playing them both meditation tapes. \u201cI was just trying to do whatever we could to relax. But he wasn\u2019t getting better.\u201d He was listless. When he ate, he only wanted to do so lying down. He still talked about the sensation of falling. On 29 November, Keri-Sue called her regular doctor\u2019s office again, begging them to squeeze Micah in for an appointment. She had stayed up all night Googling, writing down possible causes of her son\u2019s illness, including liver problems, long Covid, inflammation of the heart \u2026 \u201cI said we need to be more thorough, and went down a long list. And every single one of them, he was just like, \u2018No, no, that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. Kids are not getting long Covid. No, it\u2019s not anything with his heart, or his fingers would be blue. No, it\u2019s not his liver.\u2019 When we left, I had been given a prescription for an allergy medicine.\u201d Unsatisfied, Keri-Sue called her doctor again later that day to request an echocardiogram, a scan of the heart and nearby blood vessels. She says she was told it wasn\u2019t necessary. She couldn\u2019t sleep. \u201cI just had a horrible feeling.\u201d In the middle of the night, Micah got up to pee, and said, \u2018Ow\u2019. He pointed to his abdomen as the source of pain. \u201cI knew it was his heart or liver. I just knew.\u201d That third time at the hospital, everything seemed chaotic, and the staff appeared to be overwhelmed. (Albany medical center hospital reportedly has some of the longest ER waiting times for adults in the US.) \u201cYou can\u2019t get a response from anyone and you don\u2019t feel like you get to talk to the same person twice,\u201d Keri-Sue says. Finally, an ultrasound was ordered for Micah\u2019s abdomen. Keri-Sue sang Hush Little Baby to her son and tried to keep her eyes off the screen. The ultrasound technician finished the scan and wished them luck. \u201cI just kept saying, \u2018They\u2019re gonna help you, they\u2019re gonna help you. These people are so nice.\u2019 They weren\u2019t even being that nice,\u201d Keri-Sue recalls, \u201cbut I just kept saying it because I really wanted to make him feel safe.\u201d She started recounting stories from when she was young. \u201cI told him how my parents, my brothers and I went to Cape Cod for the weekend. Our car broke down on the side of the road and we had to hitchhike there. I was scared because we were standing on the side of the highway. But these people with a tow truck came and picked us up, and saved the day. So we made it and we were fine and happy. I was trying to create this analogy of how something scary can happen, but then it turns out OK.\u201d Dan joined them in the hospital; the hours passed as they waited for the ultrasound results. Occasionally, someone would pop their head in the door and say, \u201cHas anyone come to see you yet?\u201d and disappear. Eventually, the doctors confirmed Micah had an enlarged heart and blood clots on his liver. From her earlier Googling, Keri-Sue knew straight away he needed blood thinners, but the clinicians said they wanted to do more tests and start treatment in the morning. At this point, it was early evening, and the family, who had been at the hospital all day, worried about letting another night slip by. They were reassured: \u201cWe have a whole team of doctors that are working on this, and this is really treatable stuff and he\u2019s very stable right now.\u201d Admitted to stay overnight, they were kept waiting in a cubicle in the ER. Keri-Sue lay next to her son hugging him as he slept. At around 8pm, a nurse came to take observations and put fluid in his IV. Within minutes, Micah woke and started gasping. His eyes turned yellow and, though he hadn\u2019t needed to pee all day, he urinated across the bed. Keri-Sue ran into the hallway yelling that something was wrong. Some of the nurses hurried in, under the impression that the problem was that he had peed. \u201cThey offered to get him a diaper and I\u2019m like, \u2018No, something is wrong. Look at my kid, he\u2019s gasping for breath.\u2019\u201d And then, suddenly, after being ignored for weeks, Micah and his family had a throng of people surrounding them. The doctors put him on oxygen, but his heart rate was plummeting. They called a code blue, the signal for a cardiac arrest, and started CPR. \u201cI stood there in this tiny little room while person after person gave my son CPR. For about an hour and a half he looked like he was dead or dying. I was just pacing around saying, \u2018Micah, I\u2019m here. I\u2019m here.\u2019 At one point, they said: \u2018You should leave the room.\u2019 So we did. We went to the room next door and just stood there asking ourselves: What has happened? How is this real?\u201d A blood clot had travelled to Micah\u2019s lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism. His heart had stopped beating and they couldn\u2019t revive him. Nothing could be done. They put Micah in his mother\u2019s arms and started counting. One, two, three \u2026 when they reached 60 they declared him dead. Keri-Sue and Dan knew they couldn\u2019t just sit there for hours with their son\u2019s lifeless body, but at the same time they couldn\u2019t fathom leaving without it. One of the staff offered to push Keri-Sue out to their car in a wheelchair. But, eventually, they walked through the waiting room and out into the cold night air, passing lines of children with their parents on the way. Apart from receiving a small clay imprint of their son\u2019s hand, taken after he died, they had no further communication from the hospital. There was no explanation, there were no condolences. They simply never heard from them again. *** Keri-Sue contacted me after reading in the Guardian the story of my daughter Martha, who died, aged 13, of septic shock as a result of medical negligence. We live on different continents, in countries with different healthcare systems; our children were different ages and died from different illnesses. But we have this in common: we tried to raise the alarm about our child\u2019s deteriorating condition and we were condescended to and ignored. So when Keri-Sue describes how she plays these memories over and over, willing a different outcome; when she says that \u201cpart of me never left the hospital, is still living that moment, hoping things change\u201d, I know exactly how she feels. \u201cIt was so similar to what happened with you,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was a lot of time and a lot of opportunities for doctors to take it seriously.\u201d Martha was an inpatient at King\u2019s College hospital (KCH) in London. In our case, key bits of information about my daughter\u2019s condition \u2013 details that would have helped me advocate for her \u2013 were held back because they saw me as a problematically anxious mother. Although KCH policy states that parental concern should prompt discussions about a critical care review or a move to intensive care, with Martha the doctors decided not to arrange this potentially life-saving intervention on the basis that it would increase my anxiety. Much has been written about the diagnostic value of parental concern in medical literature. Paediatric doctors-in-training are taught to \u201clisten to the mother and father, they know the patient better than anyone\u201d. But that\u2019s rarely how it plays out. Doctors too often regard parents\u2019 involvement as a problem rather than a vital contribution: the family hasn\u2019t had years of training; in a hospital they have no status and are treated as though they know nothing. And, too frequently, a well-intentioned instinct to put a parent\u2019s mind at ease can inadvertently cause a doctor to reassure themselves. In post-death investigations into what went wrong in Martha\u2019s care, my husband and I were asked a memorable question: \u201cWere you reassured by the doctors?\u201d The problem, of course, was that we were falsely reassured \u2013 and not listened to. On 29 November 2022, 24 hours before Micah died, 13-year-old Chloe Longster was admitted to hospital in Kettering in the English Midlands. She had been suffering from severe chest pain, a cough and other cold-like symptoms before her condition rapidly developed into sepsis. Her mother, Louise, tells me she was with her the whole time. \u201cI felt like I had to try and convince them that she was poorly.\u201d Echoing Keri-Sue, she says: \u201cIt was like they were trying to gaslight us.\u201d This month, a coroner ruled that a hospital\u2019s neglect contributed to Chloe\u2019s death. There were numerous missed opportunities for sepsis screening and treatment. \u201cI really believe Chloe died because there is a pervasive belief that parents are an irritant and they\u2019re wrong,\u201d Louise says. In cases such as Micah\u2019s, a doctor\u2019s counter-argument might be that the vast majority of children they see who have non-specific symptoms like his do get better. Unfortunately, children often exhibit symptoms of serious illness in different ways from adults. Ron Daniels is an intensive care consultant and CEO of the UK Sepsis Trust. He notes: \u201cChildren can compensate for illness longer than adults can. In the case of sepsis, a child can increase their heart rate to a greater degree than an adult, which means they sometimes don\u2019t appear really sick until very late in the day \u2013 at which point they need very urgent intervention.\u201d Equally important is that children communicate differently. \u201cOddly, they are more stoical than adults, and less likely to make a fuss.\u201d Younger children especially perceive pain and discomfort in ways not always obvious to doctors. \u201cWhich means we have to listen to the experts, which in this case is the parents or carers, who just know when their child is seriously unwell.\u201d Daniels accepts that whatever doctors are taught in med school, listening to parents remains a challenge in practice. \u201cThere\u2019s a fear that if we empower people we\u2019ll be overrun by hypochondriacs and time-wasters. But most good doctors know that\u2019s not the case. No one wants to spend a lot of time in A&amp;E or a hospital ward, because they\u2019re not pleasant places to be.\u201d Or as Louise Longster puts it: \u201cChloe had never been to hospital. We\u2019re not those kinds of people. Who sits in A&amp;E for hours on end voluntarily?\u201d Which suggests those parents who do keep pushing deserve to have their fears taken seriously, especially if, like Keri-Sue and Dan, they don\u2019t have a long history of repeatedly contacting a doctor. This is the reason I have campaigned for Martha\u2019s Rule, a patient safety initiative that allows patients, families and junior staff to trigger a rapid review if they have concerns about a patient\u2019s deterioration. Martha\u2019s Rule is being introduced at 143 hospitals in England. Micah\u2019s story confirms, however, that a poor listening culture is not a problem unique to the NHS: giving patients and their families more power to raise an alarm is something that needs to happen in healthcare systems around the world. As it stands, the McManuses have filed a lawsuit against Albany Med Health System for negligence and failing to perform the necessary diagnostic tests. (When approached for comment about Micah\u2019s care, a spokesperson said: \u201c We cannot comment on pending legal matters.\u201d) They are also campaigning to introduce the Grieving Families Act, which argues that New York state law inadequately compensates families like them who lose children because of medical malpractice. New York is one of just two states that place little value on the life of a child who doesn\u2019t contribute economically. (The law is similar in the UK, where only negligible compensation is ever given to parents after a child\u2019s death from medical mistakes. I recall one legal firm\u2019s website suggesting that, owing to the high cost of raising children these days, there\u2019s an argument that parents are in fact better off once their child is dead.) Naturally, money is of little consequence when it comes to the avoidable death of a child, but there\u2019s something about a lack of accountability and recompense that feels like an affront. As Keri-Sue says: \u201cThis is not the tragedy to me. The tragedy is that I lost my son. The [resistance to the] Grieving Families Act just makes me feel like my tragedy doesn\u2019t matter much to New York.\u201d * * * Flicking through old photographs these days, Keri-Sue finds herself looking for signs of what was to come. \u201cI feel like a murder-mystery detective. Since he died, I\u2019m trying to find clues. But there is nothing to find. I guess I\u2019m just looking for anything; looking for evidence of him.\u201d The McManuses have turned part of their farm into a memorial garden for Micah. It is full of colour \u2013 lots of sunflowers and zinnias and cosmos. Keri-Sue says she has decided to plant mostly annuals there, which complete their life cycle in one growing season, from germination to flowering, setting seed and dying. Annuals have a shorter lifespan, but they bloom consistently and when they flower they are bright, beautiful, unmissable. \u201cThey remind me of Micah,\u201d she says. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t here very long. But while he was here, he was in full bloom.\u201d \u2022 Merope Mills is editor of the Guardian\u2019s Saturday magazine",

      "body": "<p>Jonathan Coe takes himself off to a classical concert when he\u2019s stuck with his writing. Some authors walk it out, or nap to get around a mental brick wall, but for Coe, who&nbsp;at 63 is publishing his 15th novel, the experience of \u201csitting there for two or three hours with your thoughts wandering, but in a disciplined way because the music is guiding them\u201d can help resolve the toughest of literary&nbsp;puzzles. The process works particularly well, he adds mildly, at those concerts \u201cwhere you\u2019re not really into&nbsp;the music\u201d.</p> <p>For Coe, this approach to problem solving was especially necessary during the writing of The Proof of My Innocence, a hugely enjoyable, genre-busting novel set during the 49 days of Liz Truss\u2019s premiership. The book, which is divided into three discrete sections, is a murder mystery, a piece of dark academia and an experiment in autofiction. Like so much of Coe\u2019s writing, it takes a big, ambitious swing at the recent past \u2013 all the venom, absurdity and sentimentality of British political life since the pandemic \u2013 and metabolises it to bring about something like meaning. Coe did this most famously for the Thatcher years in his hit novel of 1994, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/02/jonathan-coe-carve-up-book-club\">What a Carve Up!</a>, and more recently in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/16/middle-england-by-jonathan-coe-review\">Middle England</a>, his attempt to explain to himself as much as to anyone else why so many people had voted for Brexit. In The Proof of My Innocence, Coe\u2019s project was to examine the decades-long rightwards drift of the Conservative party and the polarisation of public discourse; the fact, as he puts it, that \u201cwhat\u2019s different about Edward Heath and Harold Wilson in the 1970s and, say, Keir Starmer and Liz Truss now, is that [their] narratives don\u2019t intersect at all. Which is alarming, I think. If we can\u2019t agree on any form of shared truth, then it\u2019s very difficult to have public conversations about anything.\u201d A&nbsp;description, perhaps, that makes the book sound rather serious. Because it\u2019s Coe, of course, the whole thing is as light as a souffle and tremendously funny.</p> <p>In fact, Truss as a background condition only came about later in his thought process. In the first instance, says Coe, it was the challenge of trying a new genre that appealed to him. The novel, which follows the dire fortunes of a leftwing blogger who attends a rightwing conference in a country hotel, is structured around a central mystery. \u201cI\u2019d flirted with detective fiction in What a Carve Up! and in Number 11, and really enjoyed it \u2013 it\u2019s very challenging because you can\u2019t let yourself off the hook. The plot can\u2019t dissolve into <em>meaningful ambiguity</em>, there has to be a resolution, because that\u2019s what people are reading it for.\u201d</p> <p>All genre writing, says Coe, is \u201chighly disciplined\u201d, and he has enormous respect for the crime writers who work exclusively in this mode. \u201cYou have to spin a lot of plates at the same time and the great crime writers do this yearly. I\u2019m slack-jawed with admiration for the way they do it, because you have to have a very special kind of mind.\u201d</p>    <p>What is so arresting about The Proof of My Innocence is the other genres the book takes in its stride. Coe likes to keep an eye on the Amazon top 100 and BookTok \u2013 \u201cto know what people are actually reading\u201d \u2013 and the&nbsp;sales of cosy crime, and cosy romance, caught his eye. \u201cA book called The <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/discover/pumpkin-cafe-book\">Pumpkin Spice Cafe</a> had been lodged in the Amazon top 10 for the last two weeks,\u201d he says. These are the literary versions of Hallmark movies, safe reads, says Coe, \u201cbecause people for obvious reasons are reading for comfort, which is not the only reason for reading, but in a fairly mixed-up world people increasingly turn to it. I want to try and&nbsp;give readers the satisfactions and comforts of writing in this book, which is why I try to enter wholeheartedly into the conventions and give them a country house murder and a secret passage. But I try and do slightly more wacky things around the edges at the same time.\u201d</p> <p>The wacky things include two gen Z sleuths; a brilliant, tank-like detective called Prudence who gets wasted and eats her own bodyweight in dessert before effortlessly solving the crime; and a creepy, cult-like Conservative shadow movement that has been playing a long game to put a rightwing nutter in No 10. This is prescient of Coe, given the exposure this US election season has given to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/14/project-2025-election\"> Project 2025</a>, the shadowy rightwing movement hell-bent on having Donald Trump elected so he can fire half the civil service and replace them with political appointees. In Coe\u2019s novel, the roots of the movement go back to a Cambridge professor called Sir Emeric Coutts, who \u201chad read Adam Smith and Edmund Burke at an early age and had soon concluded that in an ideal society the duty of the politician was simply to stand back and interfere as little as possible in the equitable, harmonious workings of the free market\u201d. Half a century later this conviction results in Truss as prime minister and, as the novel puts it, the feeling that \u201ceverything seemed to have become unmoored from reality\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve reacted against nationalism and facetiousness by electing the most humourless prime minister we could find</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Alongside the political story are the traditional pleasures of a Coe production: a perfectly rendered and warmly sketched outline of family life, including a twentysomething on a zero-hours contract feeling stifled in her parental home, an arms-length adoptive dad doing his best, minor marital strife, and a young man, based on the author, struggling in his first year at Cambridge. For the gen Z characters, Coe had his own twentysomething daughters to draw inspiration&nbsp;from, not least their teenage love of the TV&nbsp;show Friends, storylines from which crop up in the&nbsp;novel as a kind of&nbsp;sardonic shadow text. Coe\u2019s aim&nbsp;is&nbsp;to interrogate nostalgia, its dangers and appeal&nbsp;to&nbsp;those on all sides&nbsp;of&nbsp;the political divide, and across the generations.&nbsp;\u201cI\u2019m quite fascinated by the love for Friends by gen Z,\u201d he says, \u201cin the same way that I am by the way people turn to cosy crime; it\u2019s a safe place. And I watched every episode of Friends with my daughters, twice, when they were in their teens. It was clear that the 1990s was a safe zone for them, because it was just about pre-internet and pre-mobiles. And that gave me the whole idea for the theme that runs through&nbsp;the book of being nostalgic for a time before you were born.\u201d</p> <p>Coe, who was born near Bromsgrove, south-west Birmingham, to a research physicist father and music teacher mother, understands that \u201cyou don\u2019t want to go back and live in those worlds, because there\u2019s so much wrong with them. But the way they\u2019re presented on screen can be an incredible balm for the soul.\u201d This nostalgia is particularly appealing for writers who came&nbsp;of age when the cost of living was cheap and the&nbsp;social safety net generous. After Cambridge, Coe&nbsp;moved to London. \u201cFor me as a white, straight male&nbsp;it was a very good time, because society was really&nbsp;geared up to looking after my interests,\u201d he says. \u201cI came to London in the 80s when Thatcherism was&nbsp;only just starting and I was able to start my career&nbsp;as a writer in a way that wouldn\u2019t be possible now.\u201d He&nbsp;moved into a shared council house with a bunch of&nbsp;medical students in Bermondsey, south-east London,&nbsp;and his overheads were enough to make someone in the equivalent position today weep. \u201cI paid \u00a38 a week,\u201d says Coe, \u201cand I was signing on and getting \u00a330 a week and living on that in London, quite comfortably in a way. And that gave me the leisure to become a writer. That kind of safety net, that entry point into a creative life, is not available to young writers or musicians now.\u201d</p> <p>After the promise of Cambridge, were his parents dismayed by his lifestyle? \u201cMy parents were never very ambitious people. Comfortable, middle-class suburbia was their aspiration, really. So they always assumed that I would go into academia and have a steady job as an English lecturer in some nice Russell Group university. That was the aspiration. Well into my late 30s my father was still clipping out job adverts from the papers and sending them to me and saying \u2018this looks worth applying for\u2019. Quite rightly, they didn\u2019t think that writing novels was a viable career path, really. And it\u2019s not in many ways. Through luck as much as anything else I\u2019ve managed to spin it out. I was first published in 87, so 37 years now.\u201d</p>    <p>This is a characteristically modest summary of an extremely successful career, worn with such winning lightness it is easy to forget what a heavyweight Coe is. In those 37 years of writing, Coe has been awarded, among other prizes, the Samuel Johnson prize (in 2005, for Like a Fiery Elephant, his biography of BS Johnson), the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse prize (in 2001, for his comic novel The Rotters\u2019 Club), the Costa book award (in 2019, for Middle England), and in 1994, the John Llewellyn Rhys prize for What a Carve Up!. His productivity is quite something, and I suggest he must be enormously stubborn. \u201cI suppose that is the right word, although it didn\u2019t feel like it at the time. Dogged, maybe. I always found writing a necessity for my mental health, and was determined to do it. And I didn\u2019t have ambitions to be a Nobel prize winner or a bestseller or anything like that. But if you\u2019re going to spend a lot of your time writing books you might as well publish them. Simple as that, really.\u201d</p> <p>In recent years, it appears that Coe has become even quicker and more efficient at turning his novels around. The writing of The Proof of My Innocence took under six months, an experience Coe says he found thoroughly enjoyable because the thing just flew out of him. \u201cIf&nbsp;you&nbsp;set yourself a target of two or three pages a day,&nbsp;then 150 days later you\u2019ve got a full-length novel. And I suppose since my kids have left home there are fewer distractions.\u201d Hilariously, and contrary to every other writer talking about jamming their wifi signal to ward off distraction, Coe says that \u201cthe interesting thing is that the increase in my productivity correlates with me going on social media. I hate X now because of what&nbsp;Elon Musk has done to it, but for a while it was a really nice conversational space and I got a lot of ideas there.\u201d He writes for all the usual reasons of bursting to tell a story or to nail an undocumented state, but also, he has come to realise, because \u201cwriting is a necessity for me. I\u2019m only really happy, or functioning, when I\u2019m writing. And then between books I vegetate and slip into inertia and get very depressed. So these days, as soon as I finish a book I think, \u2018right, I\u2019d better start another one as soon as possible\u2019. I\u2019m already clocking on with the next one.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m not as cynical about people as I was \u2013 I hope as a writer I\u2019m not as ready to judge my characters\u00a0</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Coe thinks his writing may have undergone a general softening since his earliest novels. This was brought home to him particularly while he was working on Middle England, when he strained to understand why people had voted for Brexit. \u201cMiddle England was a book written deliberately to try and empathise with two completely opposite points of view, and I guess that has lingered in the books I\u2019ve written since,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not as cynical about people as I was in my early 30s, and I\u2019m not as cocksure. And I hope as a writer I\u2019m not as ready to judge my characters. I hope that makes what I write these days a bit more generous and a bit more inclusive than a novel like What a Carve Up!, for instance.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s true that the Tories in his latest book aren\u2019t cut\u2011out villains, although there are some satisfyingly horrendous toffs in the Cambridge section. Meanwhile, hovering over the narrative like a deranged ghost is the spectre of Liz Truss\u2019s premiership. Coe met the former prime minister once at a dinner at the French ambassador\u2019s house in Kensington Gardens, and the encounter went exactly as you might imagine. \u201cIt was a very starry table with movie stars, Kazuo Ishiguro, a&nbsp;lot of senior Tory politicians. And there was Liz Truss, who I was introduced to briefly and she was clearly very,&nbsp;very unimpressed to meet me. It became obvious&nbsp;within seconds of conversation that we were&nbsp;ideologically poles apart, and she wasn\u2019t there to build a conversational bridge. It was a very uncomfortable encounter for both of us, I think, although she was less fazed.\u201d Coe smiles, devilishly. \u201cShe was probably more used to that kind of discomfort&nbsp;than I was.\u201d</p> <p>Coe once memorably described the British character as a combination of \u201cnationalism and facetiousness\u201d, the purest expression of which was the election of Boris Johnson, and which, he says, \u201cwe\u2019ve reacted against by electing the most humourless prime minister we could find\u201d. What interests him as a novelist, however, is what people tell themselves, collectively and individually, to explain their own decisions. At the end of the new novel, one of the gen Z sleuths reads a news story about Truss, now on the scrap heap, addressing a conservative forum in the US. Quoting Truss\u2019s self-justifying narrative in words taken verbatim from the real speech, Coe allows his young character to experience a moment of empathy for the fallen prime minister. After all, he says now, \u201cwe all tell stories to make sense of what has happened\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 The Proof of My Innocence will be published by Viking on 7&nbsp;November.

This was brought home to him particularly while he was working on Middle England, when he strained to understand why people had voted for Brexit. \u201cMiddle England was a book written deliberately to try and empathise with two completely opposite points of view, and I guess that has lingered in the books I\u2019ve written since,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not as cynical about people as I was in my early 30s, and I\u2019m not as cocksure. And I hope as a writer I\u2019m not as ready to judge my characters. I hope that makes what I write these days a bit more generous and a bit more inclusive than a novel like What a Carve Up!, for instance.\u201d It\u2019s true that the Tories in his latest book aren\u2019t cut\u2011out villains, although there are some satisfyingly horrendous toffs in the Cambridge section. Meanwhile, hovering over the narrative like a deranged ghost is the spectre of Liz Truss\u2019s premiership. Coe met the former prime minister once at a dinner at the French ambassador\u2019s house in Kensington Gardens, and the encounter went exactly as you might imagine. \u201cIt was a very starry table with movie stars, Kazuo Ishiguro, a lot of senior Tory politicians. And there was Liz Truss, who I was introduced to briefly and she was clearly very, very unimpressed to meet me. It became obvious within seconds of conversation that we were ideologically poles apart, and she wasn\u2019t there to build a conversational bridge. It was a very uncomfortable encounter for both of us, I think, although she was less fazed.\u201d Coe smiles, devilishly. \u201cShe was probably more used to that kind of discomfort than I was.\u201d Coe once memorably described the British character as a combination of \u201cnationalism and facetiousness\u201d, the purest expression of which was the election of Boris Johnson, and which, he says, \u201cwe\u2019ve reacted against by electing the most humourless prime minister we could find\u201d. What interests him as a novelist, however, is what people tell themselves, collectively and individually, to explain their own decisions. At the end of the new novel, one of the gen Z sleuths reads a news story about Truss, now on the scrap heap, addressing a conservative forum in the US. Quoting Truss\u2019s self-justifying narrative in words taken verbatim from the real speech, Coe allows his young character to experience a moment of empathy for the fallen prime minister. After all, he says now, \u201cwe all tell stories to make sense of what has happened\u201d. \u2022 The Proof of My Innocence will be published by Viking on 7 November.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s us done for this match and indeed the series. Thanks on behalf of all the OBO team for your company and correspondence throughout. We\u2019ll be back for the West Indies white ball stuff next week (!) and for the Test tour of New Zealand next month. Until then, goodbye! Simon\u2019s full and finished report is up: Brendon McCullum is having an honest chat with Ian Ward and a still bristling Nasser Hussain on Sky. It\u2019s worth seeking out to watch in full. Sajid Khan is Player of the Series with his 19 wickets at 21.10: Off the field I\u2019m a funny guy and you should be that inside as well to keep spirits up. On this pitch if you took time to play, like Saud did, there wasn\u2019t that much in it. You had to vary pace, hit the right areas here. Nomi bhai (Noman Ali) is one of the most experienced players on the Pakistan circuit, we should be sharing this Man of the Series award\u201d England captain Ben Stokes: It\u2019s disappointing. We got thrown some challenges over these last two games and weren\u2019t able to stand up to them. All credit to Pakistan. You get thrown challenges all over the world\u2026 in a couple of weeks we go to New Zealand and will have to try to match them as well. You do what you\u2019ve got to do. We had guys playing a one-day series at home and then coming out here. The lads trained hard but when you get out in the middle it can be completely different. Whether you do well or not, you should always try to take the positives. There have been some unbelievable individual performances throughout the series. A lot to take out. Rehan and Bash coming to play Test cricket here, we know how much that means to their families. Two incredibly talented cricketers, the only way is up.\u201d Pakistan captain Shan Masood speaks: Like London buses (Test victories) come together! The first win came after a long time and it was backed up by a series win. It\u2019s special. For everyone, to stand up and give their best, it means a lot. It\u2019s about character. To be here and standing as the wining team, it\u2019s the most special thing for us. There are always going to be individual performances - Saud\u2019s was one of the best innings I\u2019ve seen. But it\u2019s small efforts combined with the big efforts that count. Our ground fielding was outstanding in this match. Little things you do turn into big things. There have been so many characters in this series and everyone has chipped in. We haven\u2019t played in these conditions ourselves. This was challenging from day one. The onus is on us now to keep taking 20 wickets. Bowlers win you matches but our first-innings batting in 2024 has been superb. We have posted scored that set games up and now we\u2019re taking 20 wickets we\u2019re getting results as well. It\u2019s heartening to have good players come in and people have grown in stature. It\u2019s about the whole team. We\u2019d like to dedicate this to the people of Pakistan, who\u2019ve been through a lot. Hopefully this will put a smile on people\u2019s faces.\u201d I\u2019ll bring you some quotes from the post match presentation in a second. Cricket never stops though and Brian Withington knows it: \u201cCongratulations to Pakistan who have turned a crisis into a dramatic drubbing of England over the last two tests. I\u2019m not sure Jason Gillespie thinks it\u2019s necessarily a blueprint for the future, but it\u2019s certainly livened up the present. Can I recommend all cricket fans now get themselves in front of the India chase against NZ, where the former are going at more than 6 an over in pursuit of 350 odd, urged on by a crowd that is bubbling with excitement at the thrill of the chase.\u201d India need 225 runs with six wickets remaining. Virat Kohli and Washington Sundar are in the middle. Simon Burnton\u2019s report is hot and fresh out the stadium: A series that started with England breaking records ended with England simply broken. Where they needed to fight they faltered, where the situation demanded strength they surrendered as Pakistan raced to a nine-wicket win, and 2-1 series success in Rawalpindi\u201d England\u2019s post mortem will rumble on but Pakistan are revelling in the moment. A week is a long time in Test cricket. Nasser Hussain describes spin as Bazball\u2019s Kryptonite and is visibly ticking about the manner of the defeat. Taking nothing away from Pakistan at all, I think he is more upset by way England folded, the old fighter in him finds it hard to stomach such a stark capitulation, especially with the talent England have. Question of temperament, ticker and talent will no doubt swirl after this. A smattering of immediate reactions: OBO don Rob Smyth pops up with a telling stat: Before Joe Root was out in the first innings in Multan England had scored 1034 for 9 in the series. After that, 603 for 38. and another: England have never lost a three-Test series after going 1-0 up. They\u2019ve lost longer series, most recently in India this year, but not three. Sealed with a six! Shan launches Bashir down the ground and hugs Shafique in the middle of the wicket. Fantastic scenes, Pakistan win their first series at home since 2021. What a reversal, we\u2019ll be unpicking this series for a long time to come. 3rd over: Pakistan 31-1 (Shafique 5, Masood 17) Shan Masood on the charge! The Pakistan skipper comes to the crease and smashes four fours in a row off Leach! One more hit will do it\u2026 Leach strikes! 2nd over: Pakistan 14-0 (Ayub 8, Shafique 5) Shoaib Bashir from t\u2019other end. England go upstairs to see if Abdullah Shafique got a tickle to Jamie Smith. Flat line. Nowt doing. 1st over: Pakistan 10-0 (Ayub 8, Shafique 1) Leach opens the bowling and so begin the last rites. Saim Ayub is in a hurry, two sweeps sent to the fence in succession. Pakistan\u2019s openers are out in the middle. \u201cMasterclass of spin bowling across the two Tests from Sajid and Noman. Big plaudits though to the glovework of Rizwan . Well done Pakistan. What a turn around.\u201d You are not wrong John Jones. \u201cA devastating turnaround\u201d Says Michael Atherton on the tv commentary. Noman Ali finishes with 20 wickets at 13.85 Sajid Khan with 19 wickets at 21.10 \u201cMorning James\u201d It is, Felix Wood. \u201cAs dispiriting as this is, I think the mammoth effort expended by England in the first Test should be taken into account. For Root and Brook the physical impact of their efforts must have been huge and that doesn\u2019t go away after a few days. Pakistan\u2019s rotation wasn\u2019t only good for the mindset reset, it also brought in significant freshness. England\u2019s problem has been that the players who didn\u2019t score big in that test haven\u2019t been able to take their turn stepping up. Duckett\u2019s turbocharged style hides the fact he\u2019s a pretty solid opener, runs wise, and I\u2019ve accepted the feast or famine argument about Crawley, but 3 is a big problem. I\u2019d worry about Smith going there and keeping wicket, Lawrence has gone backwards...what\u2019s the answer broseph?\u201d Always nice to be called broseph before 8am Felix. I think Root should bat three. He doesn\u2019t want to but it seems the only answer at the minute. I think the manner of this defeat will be what sticks in the craw for a lot of England fans. Stokes and co don\u2019t do draws but there\u2019s something to be said about fighting to the last, digging in and showing some spirit. That\u2019s a huge part of the game and one that this side don\u2019t want to seem to particularly entertain. I love the smell of wickets in the morning Leach is comprehensively stumped and that is England run through. A lovely moment as Sajid Khan and Noman Ali walk off hand in hand clutching the ball between them and raising it to the crowd. They have taken 39 wickets between them in the last two matches. What a story. WICKET! Jack Leach st Mohammad Rizwan b Noman Ali 10 37th over: England 109-9 (Leach 8, Bashir 3) England\u2019s innings nearly all over as Bashir is given lbw but the decision is overturned on DRS. It hit young Shoaib outside the line. On we go\u2026 36th over: England 109-9 (Leach 8, Bashir 3) England lead by 32 runs with one wicket left. Oh ye of little faith. 35th over: England 107-9 (Leach 8, Bashir 0) Shoaib Bashir is England\u2019s last man. \u201cJust watched Jethro Tull here in Naples.\u201d Writes Colum Fordham. \u201cNice to see Sajid Khan\u2019s celebration of a wicket by balancing on one leg resembles Ian Anderson\u2019s classic pose. They\u2019re both exhuberant performers. Sajid has been superb in these two tests, turning the series around. As has his spin twin Noman Ali. England currently in Noman\u2019s land.\u201d Rehan moves across his stumps to play a cute dab but makes a mess of it, the ball evading his stroke but not the stumps. One more to go. Sajid Khan kisses the pitch in celebration, that\u2019s his tenth wicket of the match. 34th over: England 106-8 (Rehan Ahmed 7, Leach 8) \u201cIf England can somehow get a lead of around 100 you just never know I suppose\u201d Simon McMahon sees sense mid email by the looks of it. 33rd over: England 104-7 (Rehan Ahmed 6, Leach 7) Here comes Jack Leach, he\u2019s going to have some fun by the looks of it. Reverse-sweeping Sajid with aplomb for four and then driving handsomely through the covers for three more. England do make 100, I doubt they\u2019ll make lunch\u2026 \u201cThere are many things I miss about the old country\u201d writes Phil Withall. \u201cProper pubs, football, family. Right now, I miss the fact that I can\u2019t go back to bed and ignore the cricket. I shall just have to go to the local unpub like pub and hope they aren\u2019t showing it...\u201d A good ol\u2019 fashioned England batting collapse Phil, if you weren\u2019t homesick before\u2026 Stumps splattered! Big off break from Sajid and Atkinson wafts all around it. 32nd over: England 97-7 (Atkinson 10, Rehan Ahmed 6) An Atkinson single. 31st over: England 96-7 (Atkinson 9, Rehan Ahmed 6) England inch towards a hundred and lead by 19 runs. Oh, but they\u2019ve lost seven wickets. Apologies if these are the first words you are reading as an England fan waking up with hope in your heart this Saturday morning. 30th over: England 92-7 (Atkinson 9, Rehan Ahmed 2) Rehan takes a single down to long on. Root\u2019s wicket was Noman\u2019s fifth of the innings by the way. What an impact he and Sajid Khan have had on this series. Pakistan have found a way to win it after going 1-0 down and conceding 800 runs in an innings in the first game at Multan. 29th over: England 91-7 (Atkinson 9, Rehan Ahmed 1) Gus Atkinson reverse sweeps for four, Rehan cuts away to get off the mark. England lead by 14 runs. How\u2019s your morning going? 28th over: England 85-7 (Atkinson 4, Rehan Ahmed) The players take drinks. Pakistan\u2019s first hour I reckon. Goodnight Viennetta. Lovely piece of bowling from Noman who sends down a beauty to see the back of Root and more or less seal the series for Pakistan. Flight, dip and just enough turn to lure the shot and take the edge. Root rips off his gloves and shakes his head, there wasn\u2019t too much he could\u2019ve done about that one. I\u2019m still trying to find a clip of Ben Stokes\u2019 wicket complete with befuddling leave. Here\u2019s Jamie Smith\u2019s for good measure: 27th over: England 79-6 (Root 28, Atkinson 3) Sajid Khan to Root. Penny for his thoughts. A swept single sees the more experienced man keep the strike. \u201cIs Tim de Lisle (LATER) about to have a day off?\u201d Muses Tom in Guatemala. Ha! Tim and I exchanged emails last evening about a potential handover time. Fair to say there was a soup\u00e7on of gallows of humour. 26th over: England 78-6 (Root 27, Atkinson 3) Gus Atkinson whips for two runs off his pads. England now lead by one run! You\u2019re still thinking about the bad news aren\u2019t you? \u201cFollowing from Essaouira in Morocco.\u201d Writes Andrew Sparrow. \u201cJust woken here by the call to prayer, expecting more wickets but good to read the Yorkies fighting back.\u201d This email was sent about 12 minutes ago. A fair bit has happened since. 25th over: England 76-6 (Root 26, Atkinson 1) Gus Atkinson arrives and knocks his first ball for a single. England trail by one run and are no reliant an on almighty tail wag and something special from Joe Root. Otherwise we are outta here in a hurry. Gah! Smith is gone gone gone! He comes charging down the pitch and attempts a wild hoick into the leg side, Sajid sees him coming and beats him all ends up in the flight. Stumps splattered and England have had a mad twenty minutes. Joe Root surveying the carnage from the non-strikers end. 24th over: England 74-5 (Root 26, Smith 3) Dot follows dot. Noman Ali stitches together a maiden to Jamie Smith. 23rd over: England 74-5 (Root 26, Smith 3) Smith needs to repeat his first innings heroics if England are to get themselves a sniff here. He drives for three to open his account. 22nd over: England 70-5 (Root 25, Smith 0) Jamie Smith arrives and blocks out four dots to Noman as everyone comes to terms with what has just happened. \u201cMorning all\u201d Here\u2019s Rob Harper to provide some much needed perspective\u2026 \u201cI\u2019ve been consultant on call for obstetrics overnight at my local hospital, so I\u2019ve spent the usual restless night on the sofa. What a wonderful pleasure it has been to follow this series. I enjoyed the record blitz of the first one, but there\u2019s nothing like a tight low scoring game, whether defending a score of 120 in club cricket, or the second and third tests here.\u201d \u201cA complete brain fade\u201d says Nasser Hussain on the tv commentary\u2026 Stokes leaves a ball from Noman and it thunks into his back leg bang in front of all three. Stokes does not review, stomping off in disbelief at what he has just done. Understatement: England did not need that. 21st over: England 68-4 (Root 25, Stokes 1) Root clips off his hip for one. Stokes is off the mark with a drive to cover. \u201cI\u2019m in dreary Matlock for a 30th birthday weekend tossing up the merits of more sleep vs following the cricket.\u201d Writes Michael Robinson. \u201cI wonder what\u2019ll bring me more pain: Englands inevitable collapse and innings defeat, or trying to get through today on 5 hours sleep? At least the signal is patchy so any flurry of wickets will be slower for me.\u201d A load of blokes scaling the Heights of Abraham is it Micky? God speed. 20th over: England 66-4 (Root 24, Stokes 0) Ben Stokes arrives in the middle, he needs a score. His side need him to get a score. Just as it seemed England were settling in for a decent partnership Noman Ali steps up to snare the wicket! There was 13kph difference between the ball before and the ball that Brook got an edge to, suckered by the change of pace, he didn\u2019t need to play at it but dangled his bat outside off, a big nick swallowed by Rizwan and Pakistan celebrate with glee. The lead is down to 11 runs but England lose their fourth wicket. 19th over: England 65-3 (Root 23, Brook 23) Another decent over for England, six runs pocketed off it with no alarms and no surprises\u2026 18th over: England 59-3 (Root 21, Brook 22) Shot! Root reverse sweeps Sajid Khan for four and each batter collects a single. My daughter is engrossed in \u2018Stick Man\u2019 by the side of me. Each to their own. I\u2019m more of a Smed and a Smoo kind of guy. 17th over: England 53-3 (Root 16, Brook 21) Brook punches and collects three runs into the off side. Root sweeps fine for a single. Fifty up for England, the deficit down to 24 runs. 16th over: England 48-3 (Root 14, Brook 18) Root clips for a single behind square. This pair looking, I\u2019m not going to say comfortable\u2026 sprightly. Let\u2019s go with sprightly. 15th over: England 47-3 (Root 13, Brook 18) Sajid Khan rattles whizzes through an over at warp speed. Someone think of the OBO scribe? Just a Root single off it. Warp speed chic Hair down to there Impressive moustache Love Wickets came in a bottle with a twist off cap 14th over: England 46-3 (Root 12, Brook 18) Root does exceedingly well to drop his hands and block out a grubber that shot towards his ankles in front of all three stumps. Phew. Brook gets out the paddle sweep for a single. It is cat and mouse between bowler and batter, absorbing Test cricket. 13th over: England 43-3 (Root 11, Brook 16) Now then, Harry Brook goes on the offensive, slapping Sajid Khan through cover and then biffing down the ground for back to back boundaries! Drop! Next ball Brook gets a tickle on and the ball flies to short leg but the close in fielder can\u2019t snaffle it! Let off for Brook. Two more worked into the leg side make it ten off the over. 12th over: England 33-3 (Root 11, Brook 6) Root and Brook have started busily, picking up the runs on offer and scampering between the wickets. There\u2019s signs of turn out there but it isn\u2019t ragging square at the moment. There are runs out there still, but you\u2019ve gotta graft for them. 11th over: England 26-3 (Root 8, Brook 5) Sajid Khan from t\u2019other end. He\u2019s up and at them, offering a few choice words to Root as the batter works a single from outside off into the leg side. Sajid skids it on, targeting the pads and stumps. England desperate not to lose an early wicket and get a partnership building. Two more singles collected. Who\u2019s out there? Do drop us a line if you are one of the bleary eyed or far flung followers this morning. 10th over: England 26-3 (Root 6, Brook 4) The sun beats down in Rawalpindi, a hotter day today by all accounts. Certainly some heat on England\u2026Brook blocks the first ball of the day from Noman Ali and then drives into the off side for a single. Close! Root is saved by an inside edge onto his pad which umpire Chris Gaffaney spotted and so did Shan Masood who decides against a review. Root takes a single down the ground to keep strike. Here we go, Harry Brook is on strike to Noman Ali. Let\u2019s play! Our man on the ground, Simon Burnton, sends in a quick missive: \u201cThe entrance used by the media to access the ground here in Rawalpindi is called Poultry Gate, so called because it\u2019s in the middle of a big chicken farm, and accessed by a long, single-track road with large hen houses on either side. It is noisy and smelly but the birds themselves look in good health. The headless chickens are inside the ground. Early start today to make up for lost time. England\u2019s problem is lost causes.\u201d Scratch that, play starts in about five minutes due to the early finish yesterday. I knew that really, I was just testing you\u2026 Hello and welcome to what is probably the last OBO of this enthralling series. Pakistan have England right where they want them at the start of day three, namely trailing by 53 runs in their second innings and having seen their top three batters chewed up and spun out. All the noise from the England camp is that they still believe they can pull this off, knock off the deficit and set Pakistan a tricksy total batting last. That outcome did seem somewhat unlikely when Noman Ali and Sajid Khan were up cranking up the spin cycle last evening but this is Ben Stokes\u2019 England side and so anything is possible. England\u2019s Rehan Ahmed was feeling plucky after picking up four wickets on day two: We\u2019re still positive\u2026 there\u2019s no sense of negativity or heads down. Everyone knows there\u2019s a job to do and we can\u2019t wait to do it. There\u2019s so much batting to come and we\u2019re still very positive in the changing room. The momentum is with them at the moment, but hopefully we can soak it up a bit, put it back on them and try to get a lead. I think it\u2019s still level, isn\u2019t it? We\u2019ve got so much batting in the locker room. Obviously, three down is not ideal, but it is what it is.\u201d Play starts in just over 30 minutes in Rawalpindi.",

France\u2019s culture minister, Rachida Dati, proposed this week that tourists visiting the Paris cathedral, known as \u201cthe soul of France\u201d and one of the world\u2019s great architectural treasures, should pay a \u20ac5 entrance fee to help preserve the country\u2019s crumbling churches. But while visitors to the most notable cathedrals in neighbouring countries, including Spain, Italy and Britain, routinely pay for the privilege, France\u2019s Roman Catholic church is fiercely opposed to the idea, and experts have warned it could even be illegal. Notre Dame is due to reopen on 8 December after narrowly escaping total destruction in April 2019 when flames tore through its wooden rafters and lead roof, toppling its monumental spire and prompting a mammoth five-year restoration project. President Emmanuel Macron said at the time that the cathedral, visited by 12-14 million people a year before the fire, was \u201cour history, our literature, our collective imagination \u2013 the place where we have lived all our great moments, our wars and our liberations. It is the epicentre of our life.\u201d But Dati told Le Figaro newspaper that, across Europe, people \u201chave to pay to visit remarkable religious edifices\u201d, adding that she had \u201csuggested a very simple idea to the archbishop of Paris: a symbolic fee for all tourist visits to Notre Dame.\u201d The scheme could raise up to \u20ac75m (\u00a362m) a year, which would be \u201ccompletely dedicated to a grand preservation plan for France\u2019s religious heritage\u201d, she said. \u201cNotre Dame would save all the churches of France. It would be a magnificent symbol.\u201d France\u2019s interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, welcomed the idea, telling France Inter radio that if \u201c\u20ac5 can save France\u2019s religious heritage, that\u2019s a good thing, whether one believes in heaven or not: quite simply, this is our landscape.\u201d France\u2019s national heritage charity, the Fondation du Patrimoine, has described the state of many of the nation\u2019s chapels, churches, abbeys and cathedrals as \u201cvery worrying\u201d, with about 5,000 at risk and nearly 500 in such poor condition that they are closed to the public. Guillaume Poitrinal, the body\u2019s president, said it was \u201cdelighted to see that politicians are finally beginning to understand the threat to our religious buildings: \u20ac75m a year could help prevent them from disappearing altogether.\u201d Many European cathedrals charge tourists. Tickets to Milan\u2019s Duomo cost \u20ac10 to \u20ac30 (for a fast track pass and terrace access by lift, rather than the stairs), while St Mark\u2019s Basilica in Venice is a more modest \u20ac3 (plus \u20ac10 for the bell tower). In Spain, the Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba costs \u20ac13, Seville Cathedral charges \u20ac12 and the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia in Barcelona \u20ac26. Canterbury Cathedral in the UK costs \u00a317, Westminster Abbey \u00a330 and St Paul\u2019s \u00a325. For notable cathedrals in cities popular with tourists, the income can be substantial: the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, Antoni Gaud\u00ed\u2019s masterpiece and the largest unfinished Catholic church in the world, raised more than \u20ac125m from its almost 5 million visitors in 2023. France\u2019s Catholic church, however, remains strongly attached to the principle of free access for all, whether worshipper or tourist, although some cathedrals do charge visitors to enter certain parts of the building, such as bell towers, crypts and treasuries. Churches and cathedrals must be able to \u201cwelcome all, unconditionally \u2013 thus necessarily free of charge \u2013 regardless of religion, belief, opinions and financial means\u201d, the diocese of Notre Dame said in a stern statement. It added that given Notre Dame\u2019s design, establishing a system that distinguished between tourists and people coming to the cathedral for private prayer would be \u201cextremely complicated in terms of its practicalities\u201d. It insisted it was open to \u201cother schemes that do not consist of taxing visitors to the cathedral\u201d, but said a universal \u20ac5 entrance fee would \u201cinevitably lead to people declining to visit a building that by its nature should be wide open to all\u201d. The government\u2019s suggestion could also run into legal difficulties under France\u2019s 1905 secularism law, which separated the church and the state, transferring \u2013 among other things \u2013 the ownership of religious buildings from the former to the latter. The law states that church visits \u201ccannot be subject to any tax or duty\u201d. Churches may charge visitors to enter certain rooms, for example, the bell tower, as Notre Dame itself did (for \u20ac17) before the fire, \u201cbut you cannot charge for access to the building itself\u201d, said Ma\u00eblle Comte, a public law lecturer at Jean Monnet University. Since the 1905 law is not part of the French constitution, some legal experts have suggested the government, if it was really determined, could simply rewrite it. Either way, said Ariel Weil, the mayor of central Paris, something needs to be done. \u201cThe minister\u2019s proposal as it stands may not be possible,\u201d Weil told Radio France, \u201cbut it does raise the question of the huge number of visitors to Notre Dame and the colossal investments required in our religious heritage nationwide.\u201d It was by no means absurd, Weil said, to ask \u201cwhether 12, 13, 14 million visitors a year could not do their bit. Perhaps a voluntary contribution, with a suggested fee at the entrance? There\u2019s a price, but you don\u2019t have to pay it.\u201d St\u00e9phane Bern, Macron\u2019s heritage adviser, would go further. \u201cNot when there\u2019s a service on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the house of God; it must be free then. But is it really so bad to charge tourists in shorts, with cameras round their necks?\u201d",

      "body": "<p>If Mikel Arteta needs solace regarding his team\u2019s poor disciplinary record this season the Arsenal manager could look back to the Ars\u00e8ne Wenger era. The Frenchman \u2013 who celebrated his 75th birthday this week \u2013 is remembered for his revolutionary approach to fitness and player nutrition that spelled the end for the infamous Tuesday drinking club. Yet each of the three Premier League titles he won featured at least three Arsenal red cards as they retained the fighting spirit associated with George Graham\u2019s championship winning&nbsp;sides.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/22/not-great-news-arteta-concerned-after-calafiori-joins-arsenal-injury-list\">\u2018Not great news\u2019: Arteta concerned after Calafiori joins Arsenal injury list</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Martin Keown was sent off against Derby on 29 September 2001 for two yellow cards \u2013 the first, Declan Rice take note, for \u201cpreventing a quick free-kick\u201d \u2013 he was the third Arsenal player dismissed only seven matches into the league campaign. Arteta\u2019s team haven\u2019t quite matched that, but William Saliba\u2019s red card in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/19/bournemouth-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">defeat against Bournemouth</a> in their eighth league match last weekend continued their record of dropping points this season only when reduced to 10 men.</p> <p>Since Arteta\u2019s first game in charge on Boxing Day 2019, Arsenal have been shown 18 red cards in the Premier League \u2013 at least five more than any other side. It is an issue that has taken on increased significance before Sunday\u2019s showdown at home against Liverpool given the absence of Saliba. It is a game Arsenal cannot afford to lose when they are four points behind Arne Slot\u2019s side in the table. Arteta could not hide his frustration about the consequences of the France defender\u2019s dismissal at Bournemouth and admitted before the laboured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/22/arsena-shakhtar-donetsk-champions-league-match-report\">1-0 victory over Shakhtar Donetsk</a> on Tuesday that he was at a loss about how to deal with his team\u2019s bad habit. \u201cThe most \u00adeffective way, I have to be very \u00adhonest, is not talking about it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Arsenal\u2019s desperation to finish the job after being runners-up to Manchester City for the past two seasons has not been betrayed by indiscipline alone. The victory over Wolves on the opening day was the only home league fixture they have won comfortably. They were held by Brighton following Rice\u2019s needless red card just after half-time and required late goals to beat Leicester and Southampton. The unavailability of Martin \u00d8degaard has not helped, a lack of creativity in midfield exposed badly since the captain\u2019s ankle injury.</p> <p>At least Bukayo Saka, who was an ever-present in 2020-21 and 2021\u201122 and missed only three league games last season but sat out the defeat at Bournemouth with a hamstring injury, could be back to face a team who have won their six away matches in all competitions this season. A victory over Liverpool would get things back on track, and Arteta knows that they cannot afford to keep making the same mistakes. Wenger\u2019s 2002 double winners ended with six red cards in the league but not since Leicester won the title in 2016 have a club picked up more than two and finished top.</p>    <p>There is another comparison to Wenger that Arteta will not want to hear. Thursday marked the 20th anniversary of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/24/football-daily-email-battle-of-the-buffet\">so-called Battle of the Buffet</a> when Arsenal\u2019s record 49-match unbeaten run was ended by Manchester United at Old Trafford. The fallout from that fiery game, when Cesc F\u00e0bregas threw pizza at United\u2019s manager Sir Alex Ferguson, lingered three months later when the sides met at Highbury, with Wenger furiously defending his side\u2019s disciplinary record in the face of criticism from his old foe. \u201cYou should worry about the other teams,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not angels, but statistically there is no reason to worry about us. We are the fairest team in the league.\u201d</p> <p>That proved to be a sideshow, with Arsenal finishing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/apr/30/newsstory.sport\">12 points behind Chelsea</a> as runners-up, as the balance of power swung to west London.

      "bodyText": "If Mikel Arteta needs solace regarding his team\u2019s poor disciplinary record this season the Arsenal manager could look back to the Ars\u00e8ne Wenger era. The Frenchman \u2013 who celebrated his 75th birthday this week \u2013 is remembered for his revolutionary approach to fitness and player nutrition that spelled the end for the infamous Tuesday drinking club. Yet each of the three Premier League titles he won featured at least three Arsenal red cards as they retained the fighting spirit associated with George Graham\u2019s championship winning sides. When Martin Keown was sent off against Derby on 29 September 2001 for two yellow cards \u2013 the first, Declan Rice take note, for \u201cpreventing a quick free-kick\u201d \u2013 he was the third Arsenal player dismissed only seven matches into the league campaign. Arteta\u2019s team haven\u2019t quite matched that, but William Saliba\u2019s red card in the defeat against Bournemouth in their eighth league match last weekend continued their record of dropping points this season only when reduced to 10 men. Since Arteta\u2019s first game in charge on Boxing Day 2019, Arsenal have been shown 18 red cards in the Premier League \u2013 at least five more than any other side. It is an issue that has taken on increased significance before Sunday\u2019s showdown at home against Liverpool given the absence of Saliba. It is a game Arsenal cannot afford to lose when they are four points behind Arne Slot\u2019s side in the table. Arteta could not hide his frustration about the consequences of the France defender\u2019s dismissal at Bournemouth and admitted before the laboured 1-0 victory over Shakhtar Donetsk on Tuesday that he was at a loss about how to deal with his team\u2019s bad habit. \u201cThe most effective way, I have to be very honest, is not talking about it,\u201d he said. Arsenal\u2019s desperation to finish the job after being runners-up to Manchester City for the past two seasons has not been betrayed by indiscipline alone. The victory over Wolves on the opening day was the only home league fixture they have won comfortably. They were held by Brighton following Rice\u2019s needless red card just after half-time and required late goals to beat Leicester and Southampton. The unavailability of Martin \u00d8degaard has not helped, a lack of creativity in midfield exposed badly since the captain\u2019s ankle injury. At least Bukayo Saka, who was an ever-present in 2020-21 and 2021\u201122 and missed only three league games last season but sat out the defeat at Bournemouth with a hamstring injury, could be back to face a team who have won their six away matches in all competitions this season. A victory over Liverpool would get things back on track, and Arteta knows that they cannot afford to keep making the same mistakes. Wenger\u2019s 2002 double winners ended with six red cards in the league but not since Leicester won the title in 2016 have a club picked up more than two and finished top. There is another comparison to Wenger that Arteta will not want to hear. Thursday marked the 20th anniversary of the so-called Battle of the Buffet when Arsenal\u2019s record 49-match unbeaten run was ended by Manchester United at Old Trafford. The fallout from that fiery game, when Cesc F\u00e0bregas threw pizza at United\u2019s manager Sir Alex Ferguson, lingered three months later when the sides met at Highbury, with Wenger furiously defending his side\u2019s disciplinary record in the face of criticism from his old foe. \u201cYou should worry about the other teams,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not angels, but statistically there is no reason to worry about us. We are the fairest team in the league.\u201d That proved to be a sideshow, with Arsenal finishing 12 points behind Chelsea as runners-up, as the balance of power swung to west London. But Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s withering assessment in 2007 of Wenger\u2019s failure to follow up what remains their most recent league title three years earlier should perhaps concern Arteta. \u201cArsenal have great boys,\u201d he said in a quote that resurfaced this week in reference to the current side. \u201cAbsolutely brilliant young boys, manager top, team with a great future. But they didn\u2019t win.\u201d Despite Arsenal\u2019s undoubted progress in the past two campaigns, their squad remains one of the youngest in the division with an average age of 25.6 and \u2013 the theory goes \u2013 should be expected to keep improving. Things are never quite that simple, however, and there is a feeling among many supporters that this could be the best chance to end the club\u2019s title wait given the expected absence of City\u2019s midfield general Rodri for the rest of the season with an anterior cruciate ligament injury. That doesn\u2019t factor in the possibility this could be Pep Guardiola\u2019s final season in charge of their biggest rivals and that Arsenal would be strong contenders to usurp City if he leaves given their progress recently. More immediately, Arteta must decide how to fix the hole in central defence created by Saliba\u2019s suspension, with Ben White expected to move across from right-back despite being withdrawn at half-time against Shakhtar after picking up a booking. \u201cWe have played enough with 10 men in the recent period,\u201d Arteta said. Arsenal have conceded two goals in three of their past four league games, after doing so twice in their previous 22 matches, and their makeshift defence will be wary of a Liverpool side that have won 11 of their 12 games this season. \u201cWhen we have difficulties we still are better than the opponent \u2013 that\u2019s the objective for the team,\u201d said Arteta before Arsenal\u2019s game against United in pre-season on their tour of the US, when he admitted the only way to guarantee winning the league was to win all 38 games. That was never a realistic prospect, even after they came within a point last season of matching the club\u2019s points record set in the Invincible season of 2003\u201104, but Arsenal will be itching to prove they are in it for the long run again after being blown off course by Bournemouth.",

Or the worst impossible things, which is where body horror cinema comes in: the terror of our natural anatomical order becoming, well, unnaturally disordered.</p> <p>French film-maker Coralie Fargeat, meanwhile, plays on our fear of natural and unnatural bodily deterioration in her swaggering, supersized horror-comedy <strong><a href=\"https://mubi.com/en/gb/films/the-substance\">The Substance</a></strong> (Mubi), a satire on Hollywood ageism that is as broad as a dual carriageway but has enough blunt-force impact to have kept divided audiences talking since its cinema release last month. It cannily makes its streaming debuton 31 October, conveniently sorting out many a Halloween movie night.

      "bodyText": "The surprise success of Terrifier 3 in cinemas this month \u2013 with stories of underage viewers buying tickets to family fare and sneaking into the low-budget gorefest instead \u2013 underlines a constant in the mutable horror genre: people will never lose their morbid fascination with the worst possible things that can happen to our bodies. Or the worst impossible things, which is where body horror cinema comes in: the terror of our natural anatomical order becoming, well, unnaturally disordered. French film-maker Coralie Fargeat, meanwhile, plays on our fear of natural and unnatural bodily deterioration in her swaggering, supersized horror-comedy The Substance (Mubi), a satire on Hollywood ageism that is as broad as a dual carriageway but has enough blunt-force impact to have kept divided audiences talking since its cinema release last month. It cannily makes its streaming debuton 31 October, conveniently sorting out many a Halloween movie night. I found the film overlong and conceptually thin, but there\u2019s gusto in Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley\u2019s dual performances as chemically warring inhabitants of one has-been star\u2019s body, and in its extravagantly disgusting vision of just how far the ageing process can be simultaneously reversed, accelerated and contorted.

In <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614559284\">one study</a>, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in the US found a correlation between how often people experienced hugs, and their ability to fight off colds. Those who received regular hugs in the 14 days before being exposed to a common cold virus were less likely to become infected, and experienced fewer severe symptoms if they did, compared with non-huggers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266887\">Another study</a> found that women who embraced their partner before undergoing a stressful experience had a lower biological stress response, as measured through levels of the stress hormone cortisol, compared with those who didn\u2019t receive a hug.</p> <p>\u201cIn the context of going to an airport and taking a flight, you can see how hugs could play out as beneficial in terms of managing people\u2019s anxiety or stress levels,\u201d says Banissy. \u201cThe three-minute thing is interesting, because technically, the hormones that play a role in modulating these effects can be released within a few minutes, so that could be enough to get the benefit.\u201d</p> <p>Banissy adds:\u201cOn the flip side, we know that touch and hugs are very much influenced by context; touch needs to be wanted and feel appropriate, so you might imagine that if hugging feels unnatural for any reason, you\u2019re not going to get the same level of benefit. There\u2019s a bit of a risk with putting a time cap on it, that people might feel a bit tense about it \u2013 although I\u2019m told they\u2019re not going to have hug police.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>A guide to hugging</strong></h2> <p><strong>Quick squeeze</strong></p>    <p>The most common type of hug is what psychologists refer to as a \u201ccrisscross hug\u201d, where the huggers\u2019 arms are crossed over one another\u2019s shoulders and waists. The duration matters. Although some people may prefer a slightly longer or a shorter hug, when Banissy and his colleagues at the University of Bristol <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691821001918\">studied</a> how pleasant and under control hugs lasting one, five or 10 seconds felt, they found that one-second hugs were consistently rated the least enjoyable. \u201cIf it\u2019s too brief, people may not necessarily feel the benefits in terms of emotional closeness and things like that, but equally, if it\u2019s too long it can start to feel uncomfortable,\u201d says Banissy. \u201cFive to ten seconds appears to be optimal.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Engulfing hug</strong></p>    <p>When you\u2019re feeling down or have received some terrible news, an engulfing hug can provide comfort and emotional support. \u201cIt tends to be restricted to emotive scenarios, as it may feel too intimate in other settings,\u201d says Banissy. \u201cIt is where someone literally wraps their arms around you and effectively engulfs you, bringing you in really close.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Bear hug</strong></p>    <p>Whereas the engulfing hug typically draws the recipient in from the back, the bear hug is more of a random grab and tight squeeze. The purpose and the emotion behind the hug also differs: \u201cBear hugs are often a celebratory thing, like a family reunion, or recognising an accomplishment of some kind, whereas the engulfing hug is much more supportive and tender,\u201d says Banissy.</p> <p><strong>Sporty shoulder press</strong></p>    <p>Physical gestures are a common feature of team sports, including the sideways semi-hug, semi-shoulder bump. Although the cynical might read this as an attempt to avoid contamination with the other person\u2019s sweat, research suggest these positive physical gestures still matter. Banissy says: \u201cIf you look at how often team members engage in positive touches, which includes hugs, but also things like fist bumps and high fives, you find that teams that do this more often early in the season often then go on to win more games. There\u2019s kind of a link with this and their team cohesion.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Global leader hug</strong></p>    <p>Hugging in professional settings can feel awkward, perhaps even more so when the world is watching and scrutinising your intent. So, no wonder politicians look so uncomfortable when they do it. Although there is scant research on how hugs affect professional transactions, \u201cwe do know that other forms of touch in professional settings set the stage for things like cooperation and trust\u201d, says Banissy. \u201cFor instance, people who perform more handshakes before negotiating business deals are more likely to come to joint agreements, or find outcomes that are mutually beneficial. Touch plays a really important role in that space.\u201d</p> <p>Dunbar says we should consider hugs as opening bids to establish the nature of relationships, and just do what feels natural or instinctive. \u201cThere are bound to be mistakes where we overbid or underbid relative to the other person, but my advice is to switch the brain off and let the body take over.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Self-hug</strong></p>    <p>Receiving a hug before a stressful event can help to mitigate its emotional impact, but what if you don\u2019t have anyone to hug? Fortunately, <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9216399/pdf/main.pdf\">research</a> suggests that placing your own hands over your heart or belly, or stroking the skin of your upper arms, appears to have a similar effect.</p> <p>When scientists at Goethe University in Germany compared the impact of these <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9216399/pdf/main.pdf\">self-soothing gestures</a> with receiving a hug from someone else, they found that both groups released lower amounts of the stress hormone cortisol in response to a stressful situation, compared with a control group.</p>",

Although some people may prefer a slightly longer or a shorter hug, when Banissy and his colleagues at the University of Bristol studied how pleasant and under control hugs lasting one, five or 10 seconds felt, they found that one-second hugs were consistently rated the least enjoyable. \u201cIf it\u2019s too brief, people may not necessarily feel the benefits in terms of emotional closeness and things like that, but equally, if it\u2019s too long it can start to feel uncomfortable,\u201d says Banissy. \u201cFive to ten seconds appears to be optimal.\u201d Engulfing hug When you\u2019re feeling down or have received some terrible news, an engulfing hug can provide comfort and emotional support. \u201cIt tends to be restricted to emotive scenarios, as it may feel too intimate in other settings,\u201d says Banissy. \u201cIt is where someone literally wraps their arms around you and effectively engulfs you, bringing you in really close.\u201d Bear hug Whereas the engulfing hug typically draws the recipient in from the back, the bear hug is more of a random grab and tight squeeze. The purpose and the emotion behind the hug also differs: \u201cBear hugs are often a celebratory thing, like a family reunion, or recognising an accomplishment of some kind, whereas the engulfing hug is much more supportive and tender,\u201d says Banissy. Sporty shoulder press Physical gestures are a common feature of team sports, including the sideways semi-hug, semi-shoulder bump. Although the cynical might read this as an attempt to avoid contamination with the other person\u2019s sweat, research suggest these positive physical gestures still matter. Banissy says: \u201cIf you look at how often team members engage in positive touches, which includes hugs, but also things like fist bumps and high fives, you find that teams that do this more often early in the season often then go on to win more games. There\u2019s kind of a link with this and their team cohesion.\u201d Global leader hug Hugging in professional settings can feel awkward, perhaps even more so when the world is watching and scrutinising your intent. So, no wonder politicians look so uncomfortable when they do it. Although there is scant research on how hugs affect professional transactions, \u201cwe do know that other forms of touch in professional settings set the stage for things like cooperation and trust\u201d, says Banissy. \u201cFor instance, people who perform more handshakes before negotiating business deals are more likely to come to joint agreements, or find outcomes that are mutually beneficial. Touch plays a really important role in that space.\u201d Dunbar says we should consider hugs as opening bids to establish the nature of relationships, and just do what feels natural or instinctive. \u201cThere are bound to be mistakes where we overbid or underbid relative to the other person, but my advice is to switch the brain off and let the body take over.\u201d Self-hug Receiving a hug before a stressful event can help to mitigate its emotional impact, but what if you don\u2019t have anyone to hug? Fortunately, research suggests that placing your own hands over your heart or belly, or stroking the skin of your upper arms, appears to have a similar effect. When scientists at Goethe University in Germany compared the impact of these self-soothing gestures with receiving a hug from someone else, they found that both groups released lower amounts of the stress hormone cortisol in response to a stressful situation, compared with a control group.",

      "body": "<p>In Amundsen, a short story by Alice Munro, a young woman comes to teach at a sanatorium during the second world war. Asked by a doctor what she knows about tuberculosis (TB), she tells him she has read The Magic Mountain. Like the Alpine peak above Davos on which it takes place, Thomas Mann\u2019s 1924 novel casts its vast shadow over any fictional work about illness, let alone those set in TB clinics.</p> <p>The Empusium, which the Nobel laureate Olga Tokarczuk has called her \u201cretelling\u201d of The Magic Mountain, takes place in the Silesian settlement of G\u00f6rbersdorf, the real-life model for the sanatorium at Davos. Like Mann\u2019s \u201csimple young fellow\u201d Hans Castorp, Mieczys\u0142aw Wojnicz is also apparently unremarkable, a 24-year-old sanitation engineer who arrives at G\u00f6rbersdorf with a mild case of TB. But there are hints too of a more troubling, undefined medical condition that has persisted throughout his life.</p> <p>While Hans Castorp arrives in Davos for a three-week holiday and stays seven years, Mieczys\u0142aw\u2019s visit to G\u00f6rbersdorf is concise (perhaps, having already written a mega-novel of her own in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/10/the-books-of-jacob-by-olga-tokarczuk-review-a-messiahs-story\">The Books of Jacob</a>, Tokarczuk felt no need to compete with Mann on size). But The Empusium, translated from the Polish by Antonia Lloyd-Jones, incorporates many details familiar from The Magic Mountain, from its playfully intrusive narrator to vivid descriptions of food (the consumptive diet was rich and substantial), homoeroticism (both novels include Freudian schoolboy memories involving the fondling of pencils), two characters who engage in never-ending intellectual arguments, and a foreboding sense of European culture standing on the threshold of the slaughterhouse of the first world war.</p> <p>As the story progresses, however, it feels less like a retelling of The Magic Mountain and more its own strange animal. Appropriately enough for a book in which psychedelic mushrooms crowd the forest floors, waiting to become the main ingredient of the local liqueur that stands on every table, The Empusium is very much on its own trip. Its subtitle is A Health Resort Horror Story, and Tokarczuk makes entertaining use of familiar ingredients: mysterious crones, menacing yokels, strange behaviour at Mieczys\u0142aw\u2019s guesthouse, inexplicable noises from the attic, and the creeping realisation that not everyone at the sanatorium is dying of their disease.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tokarczuk makes entertaining use of familiar ingredients: mysterious crones, menacing yokels, noises from the attic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A local tale claims that insane women haunt the forests around G\u00f6rbersdorf, sometimes tearing men to pieces.

      "body": "<p>Georgians are heading to polls in a critical election that could determine whether one of the once most pro-western former Soviet states will veer towards a more authoritarian, Russia-aligned path.</p> <p>For the past three decades, Georgia \u2013 a country of 3.6 million people nestled in the Caucasus mountains \u2013 has maintained strong pro-western aspirations, with polls showing up to 80% of its residents favour joining the EU.</p> <p>In recent years however, the government, led by the populist Georgian Dream (GD) party, has increasingly shifted away from the west in favour of Russia, showing reluctance to condemn Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>The parliamentary elections are seen by many as the most important since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, said Kornely Kakachia, the director of the Georgian Institute of Politics. \u201cThis is a watershed moment that will determine whether the country becomes a sovereign democracy integrated with the west or falls back into Russia\u2019s sphere of influence,\u201d he said in an interview in the capital, Tbilisi.</p>    <p>Longtime observers stress that these elections should be seen through a broader lens than just a geopolitical tussle between Russia and the west, with the country\u2019s democratic future hanging in the balance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/16/bidzina-ivanishvili-georgias-billionaire-puppet-master-betting-the-house-on-moscow\">Bidzina Ivanishvili: Georgia\u2019s billionaire \u2018puppet master\u2019 betting the house on Moscow</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thomas de Waal, a senior fellow with Carnegie Europe and an expert on the region, said: \u201cWhat is at stake here is Georgian democracy. There is a real risk that the country becomes a one-party state. The Georgian Dream party has been pretty open about the direction it wants to go.\u201d</p> <p>GD, which has been in power since 2012, was founded by the shadowy billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s and is viewed by many friends and foes alike as Georgia\u2019s most powerful figure even though he has not held public office for more than a decade.</p> <p>In recent weeks, Ivanishvili and his allies have vowed to ban all major opposition parties and remove opposition lawmakers after the elections, labelling them as \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d.</p> <p>During a rare public rally on Wednesday in central Tbilisi, Ivanishvili doubled down on the pledge, having promised earlier to hold a \u201cNuremberg trial\u201d of members of UNM, the main opposition party. UNM was founded by Georgia\u2019s former president Mikheil Saakashvili, who is currently in prison on charges of abuse of power that his allies say are politically motivated.</p> <p>GD\u2019s central campaign message has been \u201cChoose peace, not war\u201d, implying that the opposition would pull Georgia into a Ukraine-style conflict, while only their leadership can ensure peace and stability. Splashy billboards for the party have sprung up across the capital featuring images of bombed-out Ukrainian churches and sports arenas, contrasting them with peaceful images from Georgia.</p>    <p>Russia, which invaded Georgia in 2008 and backed armed separatists in the Moscow-backed breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, remains unpopular among ordinary Georgians.</p> <p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine has invigorated the pro-western opposition, which criticises the government for its neutral stance towards Moscow and its reluctance to impose sanctions, viewing it as a sign of allegiance to the Kremlin. But some remain wary of the possible consequences of provoking Russia.</p> <p>GD\u2019s message finds the most support in regions that suffered heavily during the 2008 Russian invasion \u2013 a five-day conflict that some Georgians blame on the reckless policies of Saakashvili, who was president at the time. The war left deep scars in the country, with Russian troops stopping just 25 miles from Tbilisi.</p> <p>Maka Khutsishvili, a shop owner in Tbilisi who is originally from the city of Gori, where he was present during a brief occupation by Russian troops in 2008, said: \u201cI am not against Europe, but we border Russia, not France or Germany. No one will come to support us if Russia invades.

      "bodyText": "Georgians are heading to polls in a critical election that could determine whether one of the once most pro-western former Soviet states will veer towards a more authoritarian, Russia-aligned path. For the past three decades, Georgia \u2013 a country of 3.6 million people nestled in the Caucasus mountains \u2013 has maintained strong pro-western aspirations, with polls showing up to 80% of its residents favour joining the EU. In recent years however, the government, led by the populist Georgian Dream (GD) party, has increasingly shifted away from the west in favour of Russia, showing reluctance to condemn Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The parliamentary elections are seen by many as the most important since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, said Kornely Kakachia, the director of the Georgian Institute of Politics. \u201cThis is a watershed moment that will determine whether the country becomes a sovereign democracy integrated with the west or falls back into Russia\u2019s sphere of influence,\u201d he said in an interview in the capital, Tbilisi. Longtime observers stress that these elections should be seen through a broader lens than just a geopolitical tussle between Russia and the west, with the country\u2019s democratic future hanging in the balance. Thomas de Waal, a senior fellow with Carnegie Europe and an expert on the region, said: \u201cWhat is at stake here is Georgian democracy. There is a real risk that the country becomes a one-party state. The Georgian Dream party has been pretty open about the direction it wants to go.\u201d GD, which has been in power since 2012, was founded by the shadowy billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s and is viewed by many friends and foes alike as Georgia\u2019s most powerful figure even though he has not held public office for more than a decade. In recent weeks, Ivanishvili and his allies have vowed to ban all major opposition parties and remove opposition lawmakers after the elections, labelling them as \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d. During a rare public rally on Wednesday in central Tbilisi, Ivanishvili doubled down on the pledge, having promised earlier to hold a \u201cNuremberg trial\u201d of members of UNM, the main opposition party. UNM was founded by Georgia\u2019s former president Mikheil Saakashvili, who is currently in prison on charges of abuse of power that his allies say are politically motivated. GD\u2019s central campaign message has been \u201cChoose peace, not war\u201d, implying that the opposition would pull Georgia into a Ukraine-style conflict, while only their leadership can ensure peace and stability. Splashy billboards for the party have sprung up across the capital featuring images of bombed-out Ukrainian churches and sports arenas, contrasting them with peaceful images from Georgia. Russia, which invaded Georgia in 2008 and backed armed separatists in the Moscow-backed breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, remains unpopular among ordinary Georgians. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has invigorated the pro-western opposition, which criticises the government for its neutral stance towards Moscow and its reluctance to impose sanctions, viewing it as a sign of allegiance to the Kremlin. But some remain wary of the possible consequences of provoking Russia. GD\u2019s message finds the most support in regions that suffered heavily during the 2008 Russian invasion \u2013 a five-day conflict that some Georgians blame on the reckless policies of Saakashvili, who was president at the time. The war left deep scars in the country, with Russian troops stopping just 25 miles from Tbilisi. Maka Khutsishvili, a shop owner in Tbilisi who is originally from the city of Gori, where he was present during a brief occupation by Russian troops in 2008, said: \u201cI am not against Europe, but we border Russia, not France or Germany. No one will come to support us if Russia invades. Young people protesting against the government might not remember the war but we do \u2026 Right now we need peace and the current leaders can guarantee it.\u201d GD also draws support in conservative regions of the country, far away from the hipster cafes and boutique shops that have made Tbilisi a popular tourist hotspot. In the industrial heartlands, where a centrally planned economy once provided jobs and a degree of welfare, unemployment and mass migration have driven nostalgia for the relative prosperity of the old Soviet era. In these areas the Georgian government, aligned with the deeply conservative and influential Orthodox church, has sought to galvanise anti-liberal sentiments by campaigning on so-called \u201cfamily values\u201d and criticising what it portrays as western excesses. In the summer, the parliament passed legislation imposing sweeping restrictions on LGBTQ+ rights, a move critics say mirrors laws enacted in neighbouring Russia, where authorities have implemented a series of repressive measures against sexual minorities. In a recent interview rife with transphobic and homophobic sentiments, Ivanishvili depicted Georgia as embroiled in a cultural struggle against the west, which he accused of trying to export corrosive values. Among other claims, he asserted that in the west, parents put pressure on children to undergo gender affirmation surgeries, and that \u201cmen\u2019s milk\u201d was regarded as \u201cthe same as women\u2019s\u201d. Ivanishvili\u2019s critics have urged that his inflammatory rhetoric be taken seriously, emphasising the geopolitical stakes involved. Georgia, located between the authoritarian regimes of Iran, Russia and Turkey, provides the only alternative route \u2013 besides Russia \u2013 for central Asian and Azerbaijani trade with the west. The route has become increasingly important as the west seeks to reduce its dependence on Russian energy and turn to the region\u2019s oil and gas resources. \u201cWe are at a unique moment when the government is transforming the geopolitical orientation and DNA of the nation,\u201d said Tina Khidasheli, the chair of the NGO Civic Idea and a former defence minister. \u201cGeorgia\u2019s pro-western course was always an exception in the region.

Zourabichvili, whose role is largely ceremony, ruled out at a press conference on Thursday any scenario other than a victory for pro-European forces. But even seasoned watchers find it difficult to predict Saturday\u2019s outcome, as polls \u2013 each commissioned by different political factions \u2013 show wildly different results. GD is likely to win the most votes, but unless it secures a constitutional majority it may struggle to form a government, with all other blocks refusing to collaborate with it. Few expect a free and fair contest in a country where ruling parties have historically relied on their so-called \u201cadministrative resources\u201d \u2013 an umbrella term that includes pressing state employees to vote and offering cash handouts to mostly rural voters. Opposition and civil society leaders are concerned that if polls show GD and the opposition parties neck and neck, the ruling party may attempt to manipulate the results, which could trigger mass protests, potentially followed by a harsh police crackdown. Another looming question is whether Ivanishvili would voluntarily relinquish power if he were to be defeated.

In a state of despair over access to her children, she had been arrested holding a knife to her own throat outside the place where two of her children were living with her ex-partner.</p> <p>The prison was aware of her history of suicide attempts and self-harm. It had also been warned that her autism coupled with complex PTSD from violence inflicted on her since childhood made the noise, use of force and loss of control in prison hard for her to cope with.</p> <p>Despite 11 self-harm and suicide reviews being conducted in the 19 days Melhuish spent there, a mandatory care plan with support actions was never prepared.</p> <p>On 4 July 2022, less than three weeks after Melhuish arrived at the prison, she was found unconscious in her cell, and she died in hospital three days later, aged 36.</p> <p>Officers had seen her making obvious preparations to end her life that day but did not consider putting her under constant supervision.</p> <p>The family say Melhuish\u2019s case is a stark reminder of the dangers of a justice system that criminalises vulnerable women.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, her daughter Oceana, 20, a care worker from Exeter, said: \u201cMum was ill, not bad.

Yet again we ask why she was ever imprisoned in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>Eastwood Park was given the lowest grade for safety in a 2022 inspection, which warned about concerning gaps in care for the most vulnerable and distressed women.</p>    <p>During her time at Eastwood Park, Melhuish was repeatedly seen cowering with her hands over her ears trying to block out noise, running into walls, punching herself and creating the means to end her own life.</p> <p>A communication support plan was produced by a neurodiversity specialist, who has since left and not been replaced, but the court heard that almost nobody even read it.</p> <p>Oceana said: \u201cThe prison did not try hard enough. They are the reason I lost my mum just before I turned 18 and I\u2019m going to have to go through all my now adult life without my mum \u2013 all five of us kids will have to. All professionals that could have done something, made a change \u2013 literally, just given her a pair of pants or given her a phone \u2013 it just wasn\u2019t even looked at.\u201d</p> <p>Before Melhuish had even entered Eastwood Park there were warnings. She had to be cut from the Serco van having made a credible suicide attempt, and there was a letter from her psychiatrist saying prison would endanger her life.</p> <p>Her best friend, Cathy Goldsmith, had called ahead from court to tell the prison that Melhuish\u2019s neurodiversity and mental health meant it was a dangerous environment for her.</p> <p>Melhuish arrived with none of her medication and when she was given the diazepam she relied on, the dosage was dangerously reduced.</p>    <p>In her last call to Goldsmith she was distressed, telling her friend that she \u201clooked like Batman\u201d after punching herself and that her medications were all wrong.</p> <p>Goldsmith believes that if Melhuish had been given proper access to a phone, \u201cshe would still be here today\u201d. The records show Melhuish trying repeatedly to call her from the prison phone but that it failed to add her number.</p> <p>Goldsmith said of the prison: \u201cThey\u2019ve got blood on their hands. They were warned by professionals and by me. Kay should never have been in prison. Just shut it down and build some therapy units for these poor women.\u201d</p> <p>Ceri Lloyd-Hughes, a solicitor for Melhuish\u2019s family said: \u201cThe tragedy of Kay\u2019s death is that it was avoidable. Two more vulnerable prisoners at Eastwood Park died self-inflicted deaths within six months of Kay. There must now be swift action to address the coroner\u2019s concerns that similar future deaths will occur at Eastwood Park or at other prisons if things do not change.\u201d</p> <p>The story of Melhuish\u2019s eventual imprisonment is also one of missed opportunities to intervene. Her family say that when she was threatening to end her life two years earlier, police used a stun gun against her and she was sectioned. They were expecting her to be treated for 28 days, but two days later she arrived home again, still desperately unwell.</p> <p>Oceana said: \u201cMy mum isn\u2019t the first and she won\u2019t be the last if there is no change. And change obviously won\u2019t bring back Mum, but if we can save lives in the future and save families from going through the grief that we went through, that\u2019s as good as it can be.\u201d</p> <p>A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cOur thoughts remain with the family and friends of Kay Melhuish. The circumstances of her tragic death are why the new government is ending the designation of prison as a \u2018place of safety\u2019 and will soon form a women\u2019s justice board, tasked with reducing the number of women going to prison.</p> <p>\u201cAt HMP Eastwood Park, improvements and training have been carried out so women, especially those in the early days of custody, are better supported.

Despite 11 self-harm and suicide reviews being conducted in the 19 days Melhuish spent there, a mandatory care plan with support actions was never prepared. On 4 July 2022, less than three weeks after Melhuish arrived at the prison, she was found unconscious in her cell, and she died in hospital three days later, aged 36. Officers had seen her making obvious preparations to end her life that day but did not consider putting her under constant supervision.

The water droplets clump together when it\u2019s about to rain, leaving larger spaces between the droplets. Less light is reflected, making the rain cloud appear darker., 2:C - It\u2019s an optical illusion! The moon is an average distance of 384,000km from Earth. When we move, its position in the sky doesn\u2019t really change much, so it seems like it\u2019s following us., 3:C - We smile to show we\u2019re friendly \u2013 other people smile back and it helps us bond. It also releases feelgood chemicals. Though sometimes people do smile when they\u2019re embarrassed or afraid \u2013 it\u2019s complicated!, 4:A - The oldest known cave art that tells a story rather than being abstract markings is in Sulawesi, Indonesia. It shows a pig and three human-like figures, and is at least 51,200 years old., 5:A - Light travels through a vacuum at 186,000 miles a second (about 300,000km a second). According to Nasa, at this speed a human would travel around the equator 7.5 times in one second.</p>\n    <h3 class=\"quiz__scores-title\">Scores</h3>\n    <ol class=\"quiz__scores\" data-result-groups-length=\"6\">\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"5\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">5 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"4\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">4 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"3\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">3 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"2\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">2 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"0\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">0 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"1\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">1 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n    </ol>\n   </div> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.mollyoldfield.co.uk/\">Molly Oldfield</a> hosts <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/everything-under-the-sun/id1442273607?mt=2\">Everything Under the Sun</a>, a podcast answering children\u2019s questions.

      "body": "<p>A small mountainous jewel of a country wedged between Afghanistan and China, Tajikistan has changed since I first visited it as a backpacker in 2009. Back then, landing in the diminutive capital, Dushanbe, at 3am, a permit for trekking and letter of invitation in hand, I was met by a virtually deserted airport and a city lit by few electric lights. Nowadays, you can get a visa on arrival, and everything in Dushanbe is louder, brighter and faster.</p> <p>Countless construction sites disrupt the capital and there has been much misjudged demolition of old theatres, teahouses and cinemas built during the Soviet era, causing (some) outrage. But it is hard to be too down on the city\u2019s central artery, Rudaki Avenue. Partly canopied by mature trees, and with statues, fountains and parks, it remains one of the most handsome streets in central Asia, appearing as&nbsp;a&nbsp;lovers\u2019 lane of sorts, filled with strolling couples. The thoroughfare also hints at the country\u2019s identity.</p>    <p>Tajik is a variety of the Persian language and Dushanbe\u2019s main road is named after the 10th-century master of Persian literature, Rudaki, who was born within Tajikistan\u2019s modern-day borders. Along with the Qur\u2019an, books of Rudaki\u2019s poems remain the most purchased in Tajikistan. Of this heritage, a Tajik friend of mine, Mirzoshah Akobirov, once told me, \u201cFor hundreds of years our culture has had links to Persia, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. Our culture is not, and has never been, Russian.\u201d</p>    <p>As I visited the British Museum\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/sep/24/silk-roads-review-british-museum-london\">Silk Roads exhibition</a> (until 23 February 2025) in London I was reminded of two things: first, that the&nbsp;term \u201cSilk Road\u201d is a convenient label for sprawling geographies, fuzzy-edged spiritual territories and a&nbsp;timeline stretching from roughly 200BC to AD1400. And second, how integral Tajikistan was to it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Silk \u2013 along with garnets and glass, ideas and religions \u2013 went travelling along these vast interlocking networks through deserts and mountains and across countless borders</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ancestors of modern Tajiks were the famed Sogdians, who as middlemen and long-distance traders dominated east-west commerce, with their command peaking around AD500. Their capital was the trading hub of Maracanda (Samarkand), now in Uzbekistan though still with a large Tajik population today.</p> <p>Silk was but one precious item \u2013 along with everything from garnets and glass to ideas and religions \u2013 that went travelling along these vast interlocking networks through deserts and mountains and across countless borders. And today the romantic allure of the Silk Roads still pulls travellers down its various strands, from the cities of the Caucasus and ports of Turkey to the museums of China.</p>    <p>Connecting the Silk Roads dots is addictive and for years I\u2019ve done so, but central Asia still feels like the centre of it all, somewhere you don\u2019t need all that much imagination to picture how it once was.</p> <p>In Uzbekistan, you can shop in covered marketplaces just as merchants once did, and you can sleep in a converted caravanserai where travellers would tie up their animals and rest for the night.

      "bodyText": "A small mountainous jewel of a country wedged between Afghanistan and China, Tajikistan has changed since I first visited it as a backpacker in 2009. Back then, landing in the diminutive capital, Dushanbe, at 3am, a permit for trekking and letter of invitation in hand, I was met by a virtually deserted airport and a city lit by few electric lights. Nowadays, you can get a visa on arrival, and everything in Dushanbe is louder, brighter and faster. Countless construction sites disrupt the capital and there has been much misjudged demolition of old theatres, teahouses and cinemas built during the Soviet era, causing (some) outrage. But it is hard to be too down on the city\u2019s central artery, Rudaki Avenue. Partly canopied by mature trees, and with statues, fountains and parks, it remains one of the most handsome streets in central Asia, appearing as a lovers\u2019 lane of sorts, filled with strolling couples. The thoroughfare also hints at the country\u2019s identity. Tajik is a variety of the Persian language and Dushanbe\u2019s main road is named after the 10th-century master of Persian literature, Rudaki, who was born within Tajikistan\u2019s modern-day borders. Along with the Qur\u2019an, books of Rudaki\u2019s poems remain the most purchased in Tajikistan. Of this heritage, a Tajik friend of mine, Mirzoshah Akobirov, once told me, \u201cFor hundreds of years our culture has had links to Persia, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. Our culture is not, and has never been, Russian.\u201d As I visited the British Museum\u2019s Silk Roads exhibition (until 23 February 2025) in London I was reminded of two things: first, that the term \u201cSilk Road\u201d is a convenient label for sprawling geographies, fuzzy-edged spiritual territories and a timeline stretching from roughly 200BC to AD1400. And second, how integral Tajikistan was to it. Ancestors of modern Tajiks were the famed Sogdians, who as middlemen and long-distance traders dominated east-west commerce, with their command peaking around AD500. Their capital was the trading hub of Maracanda (Samarkand), now in Uzbekistan though still with a large Tajik population today. Silk was but one precious item \u2013 along with everything from garnets and glass to ideas and religions \u2013 that went travelling along these vast interlocking networks through deserts and mountains and across countless borders. And today the romantic allure of the Silk Roads still pulls travellers down its various strands, from the cities of the Caucasus and ports of Turkey to the museums of China. Connecting the Silk Roads dots is addictive and for years I\u2019ve done so, but central Asia still feels like the centre of it all, somewhere you don\u2019t need all that much imagination to picture how it once was. In Uzbekistan, you can shop in covered marketplaces just as merchants once did, and you can sleep in a converted caravanserai where travellers would tie up their animals and rest for the night. In the morning, you can order tea made with classic Silk Roads spices, such as cardamom and saffron, and drink it in chaikhanas (teahouses) which doubled as informal courtrooms and newsrooms back in the old Silk Roads days. During my last visit to Dushanbe, at the National Museum of Tajikistan I peered at a tiny gold earring in the shape of a sphinx that is more than 2,000 years old and was found close to the city, and ancient fragments of Buddhas (the British Museum\u2019s show highlights Buddhism\u2019s progress across central Asia via objects loaned for the first time from Tajikistan). And I gazed at murals from Penjikent, a tiny and welcoming city once at the heart of ancient Sogdiana. In a shared minibus from Dushanbe, I headed north-west to Penjikent for four hours, just as I had done in 2009. As soon as we were out of the capital, spires of mountains appeared, steep and densely stacked, orange marmots went scattering across fields and women sold the ancient nomadic snack qurut (salted dried milk curds rolled into balls) at roadside bends. It\u2019s a logical route as from Penjikent you can easily carry on to the most idealised Silk Roads city of all, Samarkand, providing the Tajik-Uzbek border crossing is open. Penjikent\u2019s museum dedicated to Rudaki, who was born nearby, is worth a stop but really it\u2019s all about visiting the sunbaked \u201cPompeii of Central Asia\u201d, the archaeological site of ancient Penjikent, where on a terrace are the ruins of a once significant Sogdian town and fortress. Windblown and a little desolate, this Silk Roads site has given up immense treasure, including eighth-century frescoes that are on display in Dushanbe (with other sections taken to St Petersburg\u2019s State Hermitage Museum). Penjikent developed because of trade routes and its fertile position by the Zarafshan River, literally the \u201cstrewer of gold\u201d, and it is justifiably proud of its ancient history.

      "body": "  <h2>Steve McQueen on Paul Gilroy</h2> <p>The first book I read by Paul Gilroy was <a href=\"https://sites.gold.ac.uk/goldsmithshistory/there-aint-no-black-in-the-union-jack-by-professor-paul-gilroy/\">There Ain\u2019t No Black in the Union Jack</a>. I was 19 and studying fine art at Goldsmiths, and it turned my head like nothing before. For a young person looking for answers and clues, to have that sort of book was eye-opening. It uncovered and revealed things. And then I read his masterpiece, <a href=\"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674076068\">The Black Atlantic</a>. It was huge. His ideas about modernity and double-consciousness represented a major shift in thinking throughout the world. That book spoke to so many people.</p> <p>The way his books tell the stories of black lives is surgical and detailed, and at the same time poetic. I think that\u2019s important: truth has to be communicated, but it also has to be felt. His work has been a springboard for so many people \u2013 artists, musicians, actors. It has a foundational quality that allows you to jump off. It propels you and allows you to go even further.</p>    <p>He was teaching at Goldsmiths when I was studying there, so I knocked on the door of his office and started asking him all these questions. He welcomed me inside and started to talk to me. This was Paul Gilroy \u2013 the premier intellectual of the UK, if not Europe and the world \u2013 and I was a 19-year-old kid! I was probably asking the most embarrassing things, but he\u2019d send me off with books to read and essays to write. He had this enormous patience and generosity.</p> <p>What\u2019s interesting about Paul is that he cares about getting things done. He doesn\u2019t care about who people think he is, or about being known. It\u2019s all about evidence, and the work finding an audience: he wants to be in the public consciousness, not in the public eye. He\u2019s an unsung hero, but consciously so. He\u2019s not interested in being anyone\u2019s hero.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/steve-mcqueen\">Steve McQueen</a> is a British film producer, screenwriter and video artist, and the director of films including Blitz and 12 Years a Slave</p></li> </ul>    <h2>Vivienne Acheampong on Afua Hirsch</h2> <p>I have been an admirer of <a href=\"https://www.afuahirsch.com/about/\">Afua Hirsch\u2019s</a> work for about 10 years. When I first came across her, as a Black British woman of Ghanian heritage I formed a connection instantly. Her ability to amplify the stories of Black lives past and present was something that I was in awe of.</p> <p>Her book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/18/british-by-afua-hirsch-review\">Brit(ish): On Race, Identity and Belonging</a> resonated with me so deeply I can honestly say it transformed my life. She conveyed so profoundly what it is to be Black and British, and to be part of the diaspora, bringing such a nuanced perspective around race in a way that I hadn\u2019t experienced before.</p> <p>Hirsch consistently confronts, challenges and exposes truths about Britain\u2019s colonial past and its impact on contemporary racial dynamics, and how it still has an influence on racial inequality today.</p>    <p>I love how she celebrates Africa and all the riches and beauty it has to offer, something that we rarely get to witness in mainstream media. Her TV series <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0fpwbxp\">Africa Rising</a> was uplifting and joyous to watch, highlighting the arts and culture pouring out of our great continent and its ongoing reinvention and growing influence on the global stage.</p> <p>I again devoured her most recent book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/oct/19/decolonising-my-body-by-afua-hirsch-review-reclaiming-beauty\">Decolonising My Body</a>, which powerfully explores how our Black bodies have been influenced by colonialism, and how we can reclaim our traditions to redefine our own beauty standards.</p> <p>Quite frankly, Afua Hirsch is a hero to me. Her activism, pursuit of positive change and ability to empower other Black voices to tell our own stories is something I am for ever inspired by.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://officiallondontheatre.com/news/tell-us-ten-vivienne-acheampong/\">Vivienne Acheampong</a> is an actor and comedian best known for playing Lucienne in the Netflix series The Sandman, and her appearances in BBC3\u2019s Famalam. </p></li> </ul>    <h2>Clive Myrie on Frederick Douglass</h2> <p>The task of telling the story of Black lives can simply mean providing depth and context around the actions of Black people in certain situations, historical or contemporary, to correct a false record. Writers such as <a href=\"https://www.garyyounge.com/about\">Gary Younge</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-olusoga\">David Olusoga</a>, in my opinion, properly contextualise Black lives and correct narratives, helping reframe stories from Black perspectives and enriching our understanding of Black lives lived.</p> <p>However, I have decided to focus on a figure from the 19th century as someone I revere for telling the stories of Black lives, who did so not only through the written word but also photographs. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/frdo/index.htm\">Frederick Douglass</a>, the social reformer, abolitionist and statesman, became the most important campaigner for African American civil rights and human rights in general in the Victorian era. Born into slavery, he escaped at the age of 20, but having learned to read as a boy, he went on to become one of the great writers and dazzling orators of his era. He travelled the world speaking in the newly built Victorian meeting halls to packed and rapt audiences on abolition and racism, women\u2019s rights, female suffrage and workers\u2019 rights. He often equated his own suffering with the universal struggles of people throughout the world for freedom and respect.</p>    <p>But there\u2019s more to this great man than the spoken and written word. (He wrote no less than three autobiographies; I\u2019ve struggled to write one!) There are 160 known photographic portraits of Douglass, and that\u2019s a lot. He is in fact one of the most photographed Americans of the 19th century, and in controlling his image, he controlled his own narrative.</p> <p>Was he just vain? Well, he was a good-looking dude and he knew it, never seen without a natty cravat and immaculate frock coat. But I think Douglass also understood the revolutionary potential of the image. The camera showed the truth. It forced the viewer to engage with the subject on a human level and it could be reproduced over and over, reaching millions of people through books, pamphlets and newspapers. That image could change minds.</p> <p>Most pictures of Black people in the 19th century were gross caricatures, racist stereotypes, grotesque minstrels or of lynching victims. Douglass presents himself as a handsome well-dressed man, sitting on well-upholstered chairs, sometimes with a book or papers at hand. He is dignified, intelligent, with a glimpse of the fighter in his eyes. There is one other rather radical photo showing himself with his second wife, who was white, and her sister. He is seated, his wife stands over him: a role reversal of the conventions of Victorian portraiture. A radical image, of a piece with a radical man.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://x.com/CliveMyrieBBC?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Clive Myrie</a> is a BBC News presenter, foreign correspondent and hosts Mastermind</p></li> </ul>    <h2>Abena Oppong-Asare on Paul Boateng</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul-boateng\">Paul Boateng</a> tells our story past and present. He belongs to a generation of political leaders who broke through the barriers of racial discrimination. He inspires me, not only because he cleared a path for a Ghanaian-heritage girl such as me to contemplate a career in public service, but also because of what he did next. He is part of that vital 1987 breakthrough into an all-white House of Commons. He was the first Black government minister, and then the first Black cabinet minister.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/202961.stm\">a minister in the Blair government</a>, he tackled child poverty, fought for disabled people, and at the Treasury delivered billions to Britain\u2019s public services. He was the UK\u2019s high commissioner to post-apartheid South Africa. Now he sits in the House of Lords, sharing his wisdom and articulating his fierce passion for justice. He\u2019s also a brilliant chancellor of my local <a href=\"https://www.gre.ac.uk/\">University of Greenwich</a>.</p>    <p>Some tabloids scoffed when he declared at his election count \u201c<a href=\"https://www.voice-online.co.uk/news/uk-news/2012/06/02/pioneers-who-opened-the-door-2/\">today Brent South, tomorrow Soweto</a>\u201d, but he was right and they were wrong.</p> <p>We take it for granted that there should be Black MPs, but in the 1980s plenty of people disapproved. Even today Black MPs are sadly abused, delegitimised and confused for one another. It is assumed so often that a new Black MP must be in the wrong place. Yet thanks to Paul, alongside Diane Abbott and Bernie Grant, we are here, and we\u2019re staying.</p> <p>Lord Boateng proves that passion plus determination moves mountains. And as he shows whenever I catch up with him in parliament, in politics you can be kind as well as tough.</p> <ul> <li><p>Abena Oppong-Asare is MP for Erith and Thamesmead and parliamentary secretary to the Cabinet Office</p></li> </ul>    <h2>Nels Abbey on Arikana Chihombori-Quao</h2> <p>In western media Arikana Chihombori-Quao, the former African Union ambassador to the US, is a nobody. Practically anonymous. Yet in western diplomatic circles operating in Africa (notably the French), she is a dagger in the ribcage. Most importantly, however, to Africans at home and in the diaspora, Chihombori-Quao is a rock-star historian and political thinker.</p>    <p>What makes the Zimbabwean-born doctor turned diplomat famous in certain diplomatic circles is exactly what makes her one of Africa\u2019s most beloved intellectuals (and perhaps the only African diplomat most people could name). She tells deeply inconvenient truths, with a knack for joining the dots between the atrocities of the past and the disasters of the present. She doesn\u2019t just chronicle and contextualise African history, but uses it as a powerful force to inspire the children of Africa to right the seemingly permanent wrongs of the past in a bid to create a more prosperous, powerful and harmonious future.</p> <p>Chihombori-Quao\u2019s speeches on France\u2019s continued colonial activity in Africa, such as currency issuance and fixing, compulsory foreign exchange deposits and first-refusal rights on resources, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/16/africa/petition-over-sacking-of-au-ambassador/index.html\">earned her the sack</a> from the African Union. The same speeches went on to form the intellectual basis for the slew of popular revolutions (some would say \u201ccoups\u201d) that have swept across former French colonies in Africa (namely: Burkina Faso, Chad, Gabon, Guinea, Mali and Niger) since 2020.</p> <p>Chihombori-Quao\u2019s most important work, however, has been to bring into public consciousness the damning legacy of the 1884 <a href=\"https://youtu.be/jOTEs2UHego?t=79\">Berlin conference</a>, which formalised the European colonisation of Africa and, catastrophically, balkanised Africa into perpetual economic nonstarters. Her powerful use of illustrative examples in this regard, including the normalised insanity of microeconomies such as Djibouti, Togo and Burundi being expected to compete with the US, China and Germany, have rendered her one of this generation\u2019s leading pan-Africans.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nels Abbey is an author and broadcaster</p></li> </ul>    <h2>Maxine Watson on Marlon James</h2> <p>I recently read the novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/31/the-trees-by-percival-everett-review-potent-satire-of-us-racism\">The Trees by Percival Everett</a>. It takes the case of <a href=\"https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/stories/emmett-tills-death-inspired-movement\">Emmett Till</a>, the 14-year-old black boy lynched in Mississippi in 1955, for allegedly whistling at a white woman, and turns it into a modern murder mystery with a touch of the supernatural. It struck me as a compelling way of not only bringing black history to life but also of offering us a chance to have an opinion and express a view on narratives often written about us by others.</p> <p>Black authors who use historic events as the basis for their work perhaps do so as a way of reclaiming the past and rewriting the narrative to explore it with a full-on black gaze. No one does it as uncompromisingly as <a href=\"https://marlonjameswriter.com/\">Marlon James</a>. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/10/brief-history-of-seven-killings-marlon-james-review\">A Brief History of Seven Killings</a>, based on the near fatal shooting of reggae icon Bob Marley in 1976, hits you like a sucker punch. James seeks to locate the players: the \u201cbad man\u201d who run and control the tenement yards of downtown Kingston, within the reality of Jamaican life. They are imbued with dimensions and a humanity that shines through the brutality. James, a black, gay, Jamaican native, brings all of this to bear on the world he creates. There is an authenticity and complexity to the inner lives of his characters that can only be achieved when written by someone with black skin in the game.</p>    <p>His 2009 novel <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2014/12/we-second-that-second-novel-list-marlon-james-the-book-of-night-women.html\">The Book of Night Women</a> is no exception. There are no passive enslaved women here. Each has agency and a point of view. Their voices are rich and varied within a hierarchy of their own making.</p> <p>James\u2019s writing is bold and audacious for sure \u2013 but, like a black cowboy at a Texan rodeo, it is his ability to wrangle our history and bend it so perfectly to his will that sets him apart, and makes him an unflinching and unapologetic chronicler of our story.</p> <ul> <li><p>TV executive Maxine Watson is an award winning former BBC documentary commissioner and producer </p></li> </ul>    <h2>Daniel Kebede on James Baldwin</h2> <p>As we await the US election, I\u2019m reminded of what <a href=\"https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/stories/introduction-james-baldwin\">James Baldwin</a> said during the 1980 presidential race. In an essay for the Nation,<em> </em>he unpicked with customary wit and insight how the political system had failed Black people. Evoking Gabriel on Judgment Day, he writes: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/12012347-the-children-are-always-ours-every-single-one-of-them\">The children are always ours, every single one of them, all over the globe</a>; and I am beginning to suspect that whoever is incapable of recognising this may be incapable of morality.\u201d</p>    <p>In his <a href=\"https://www.baldwincentennialproject.com/\">centenary year</a>, Baldwin still communicates an important message of human equality. As someone at the forefront of the civil rights movement for decades, we would do well to keep his eloquent words in our heads when we see conflict and unrest the world over. My thoughts are always for the plight of children, and what we can do to make their lives better and to set an example for the next generation.</p> <p>Raised in Harlem during the Great Depression, Baldwin saw poverty with his own eyes every day. That experience never leaves you. It shapes you, and in later life it drove him to articulate the voice of the disfranchised. He understood the power of words. His penetrating insights are nothing without his persuasive prose. And if that meant a bit of righteous anger too, then all the better.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://neu.org.uk/about/about-us/who-who\">Daniel Kebede</a> is general secretary of the National Education Union, the largest education union in Europe</p></li> </ul>    <h2>Natasha Beckles on Toni Morrison</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/06/toni-morrison-obituary\">Toni Morrison</a> is the storyteller\u2019s storyteller: the psychological midwife; the Melchizedek prophet-priest who blessed me as a teenager through exquisite words and epigenetically remembered histories.</p> <p>Chloe Anthony Morrison, born Chloe Ardelia Wofford, expressed in essays and demonstrated in interviews a devastating gift of situational insight. Her books were like tents made of seminal statements that opened liminal spaces, into which sojourning readers might enter and discover something about themselves and the world.</p> <p>Her writing is unflinching, uncompromising and unapologetic in its intent. Her unblinking stare and healing hands anoint the faces of racialised people, honouring their \u201cliving while Black\u201d experiences.</p>    <p>Mother Toni\u2019s work exposes whiteness in its atomic genesis, its epidemic acceleration, its systemic and generational violence without ever really giving it the time of day. Instead, she devotes her energy to each of her characters \u2013 kissing their tears, recording their trauma, testifying to their humanity with whispers of love, wisdom and compassion \u2013 while allowing the legacy of their learnings and philosophy to irrigate the observant heart.</p> <p>Her writing takes stories of terror and bends time to hold them tight and precious, stitching them together in love and dignity like jewels. Never to glorify the horror but always to teach the reader to <em>see</em> the faces and not turn away from those who are unseen and not comforted.</p> <p>Her epistemological grip within bewilderingly difficult human experiences taught me to stay present, to think and feel past the entirely appropriate responses of shock, rage, fight or flight. She taught me to find equanimity and resistance by being with myself and others, in the moment.</p> <p>St Toni loaned me respectful hands and arms to truly embrace those who mourn. She taught me how to bear witness to love and hope, by listening and attending to human testimony until the grief within the speaker, the listener and the reader, finds its peace.</p> <p>She curated rooms where self-compassion and courage flourished. That has shaped my leadership and my priesthood.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.stnicholasperivale.church/our-rector\">Natasha Beckles</a> is rector of St Nicholas church, Perivale, west London</p></li> </ul>    <h2>Dean Forbes on Akala</h2> <p>My introduction to Akala was through the songs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCcqS6AP8uI\">Shakespeare</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjvUMr1-AAU\">Find No Enemy</a>. To get a sense of his work, that\u2019s a great place to start. Then listen to any of his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEOKgjoxoto\">Fire in the Booth</a> performance and you\u2019ll hear the freestyle version of him, which is the first version I came across and where his skills really shine.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always been a fan of rap, especially music that has brilliant vocabulary, sharp lyrical content and strong storytelling. Those things all stood out to me when I first heard Akala. What drew me in was his ability to represent topics that are not usually represented in rap music and hip-hop: topics around our heritage, the oppression black people have faced, and his overall societal observations.</p> <p>Akala grew up in a working-class background, just like me, and on the surface he presents as a kind of stereotype: black guy, rapper, not very clean-cut, no suit and tie in sight. But then he opens his mouth \u2013 and what he comes out with is so unexpected, yet so profound. He\u2019s incredibly educated, articulate and able to make his point in such a measured way \u2013 whether that\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUtAxUQjwB4\">addressing the Oxford Union</a>, facing off against <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLr0wdQZzyc\">someone with an opposing view</a> on Question Time, or in his book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/24/natives-race-class-ruins-empire-akala-review\">Natives</a>.</p>    <p>Akala does two things that are very important. First, he\u2019s one of the most relevant spokespeople for the black community, as often a protest is to shout and bang our fists and demand action; and in the most beautiful and elegant way, he challenges racial stereotypes with points that are substantive, well-researched and founded in education, without bluster and emotion.</p> <p>I actually met him a couple of weeks ago. It was at a mutual friend\u2019s party and we were listening to hip-hop and reggae and having a whale of a time. You\u2019re always anxious about meeting someone you hold in high regard in case they let you down, but he was as brilliant, articulate, challenging and engaging as I had hoped he would be.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.forterro.com/en/people/dean-forbes\">Dean Forbes</a> is CEO of tech company Forterro, Chairman of Forbes Family Group and has been named the most influential Black Briton in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/oct/25/dean-forbes-tops-2025-powerlist-uk-most-influential-black-person\">this year\u2019s Powerlist</a></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Micha Frazer-Carroll on Angela Davis</h2> <p>At the turn of the millennium, my primary school celebrated with a dress-up day. We all had to dress as a significant figure from the past 100 years. Aged six, I had no shortage of Spice Girls in my class. But my mum decided to style me as <a href=\"https://nmaahc.si.edu/angela-davis\">Angela Davis</a>, complete with an afro wig and flared jeans. I had no idea who the American Black feminist scholar and activist was, but looking back at age 30, I feel a strong sense of pride in my mum\u2019s radicalism.</p>    <p>My present-day work as a Black feminist writer has been completely shaped by Davis\u2019s thinking, which attempts to transform the material injustices of Black life. In addressing issues that affect Black people globally, Davis puts forward unapologetically radical solutions. When I was 23, my mum gifted me a copy of Davis\u2019s book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/11/rise-up-the-best-books-about-the-power-of-protest\">Freedom Is a Constant Struggle</a>, which was my first introduction to the concept of prison abolition. Having been engaged in the Black Lives Matter movement for years, the idea seemed unthinkable and exhilarating. Davis\u2019s ability to connect the Black struggle to issues of state, gender, class and the economy was firmly rooted in her experience as a Black working-class lesbian and prisoner in the 1970s.</p> <p>When I was 24, I was invited to a Black feminist symposium at Cambridge (my alma mater) that Davis attended. The energy in the room, which was filled with Black female student activists, was electrifying. This was the woman whose work had directly informed initiatives such as FLY, Cambridge\u2019s consciousness-raising group for women of colour, which had been such a crucial lifeline for Black female students at an overwhelmingly white university. Myself and a friend ended up mingling in a circle with Davis, and found ourselves speechless, giggling schoolgirlish messes when the time came to introduce ourselves. Unable to articulate the way she has helped me understand Black womanhood, I wonder if I was a little transported back to being that six-year-old in the Davis wig.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.michafrazercarroll.com/\">Micha Frazer-Carroll</a> is a journalist and author of <a href=\"https://www.plutobooks.com/9780745348490/mad-world/\">Mad World: The Politics of Mental Health</a></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Mike Gayle on Donald Rodney </h2> <p>I\u2019d never heard of the late Birmingham-born artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/article/2024/may/29/donald-rodney-review-spike-island-bristol\">Donald Rodney</a> until I happened across his work at the Nottingham Contemporary gallery earlier this month. But when I was asked to think about who I admire for telling the stories of Black lives, his name jumped into my head. It\u2019s an indicator of just how impactful the show, <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/rodney-visceral-canker-t12769\">Visceral Canker</a>, is, that of all the Black people who have inspired me, he came to the fore. </p>    <p>The show, a collection of his work from 1982 to 1997, spoke profoundly of what it means to be Black and British. In addition, it drew attention to what it means to live with constant pain and be in and out of hospital, as he was as a sufferer of sickle-cell anaemia, a disease that eventually claimed his life at the age of 36.</p> <p>For Rodney, who first studied art in Bournville in Birmingham, then later Nottingham and London, art could be personal and political. That\u2019s a position powerfully established in the photographic work <a href=\"https://www.southlondongallery.org/collection/donald-rodney/\">Flesh of My Flesh</a>, which features a brutal and unflinching close-up of his own hip scar \u2013 caused by a surgeon who believed Black skin was so tough that it needed more stitches than white. His 1992 piece <a href=\"https://portal.cca.edu/events-calendar/richard-hylton-doublethink-donald-rodney-and-challenges-corrective-art-history/\">Doublethink</a>, made of cheap sporting trophies engraved with the casually racist statements he\u2019d gathered from various sources over time, is equally powerful. It serves as a reminder, if one were needed, of how white society venerates Black excellence on the sporting field while denigrating Black society away from it.</p> <p>His work as a whole is at once thought-provoking, enraging and deeply moving. Despite the almost 30 years since his passing, it is still blisteringly relevant today.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.mikegayle.co.uk/\">Mike Gayle</a> is the bestselling author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/mar/10/they-were-treated-terribly-why-lad-lit-veteran-mike-gayle-is-finally-tackling-racism\">All The Lonely People</a>, Half a World Away and A Song of Me and You.

When he tells the stories of black lives, he does so with all the knowledge and credibility of someone who has done the research, but the way he talks about his own story and background makes him very relatable. He\u2019s telling stories for black Britons, and I don\u2019t feel that happens often enough.</p> <p>I first came across him when his 2016 BBC series, Black and British: A Forgotten History, <a href=\"https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a32799275/bbc-black-and-british-forgotten-history-documentary-black-lives-matter/\">was rebroadcast in 2020</a> after the murder of George Floyd. All of the history I\u2019d been taught at school had been about significant white players, and this was the first I\u2019d learned about the history of black British people. It was the first time I really felt a connection to British history. It gave me a sense of validation, and it kind of blew me away.</p>    <p>Last year, he came to speak at the National Black Police Association conference in south Wales. He talked about the impact and history of racism and policing, and how the government around the 1950s painted a picture to the public about the threat that black people coming to the country would pose. Yet simultaneously the government was encouraging migration from West Indian colonies. He told us how, at the time, the government had gone to several chief constables and asked them to conduct research to prove their theory that black people were the cause of all the problems in society.</p> <p>It was really useful to understand the distrust between black communities and policing, and how far back it goes. I think that\u2019s something that should be taught to police officers and importantly future generations in policing, so they understand this is intergenerational trauma and can help build empathy when interacting with black communities.</p> <p>Olusoga honestly opened my eyes to a lot of these things. I just wish more people would watch his programmes and read his books.</p> <ul> <li><p>Kimberley Bownes is a detective sergeant with Hampshire and Isle of Wight police and a cabinet member of the <a href=\"https://www.nationalbpa.com/\">National Black Police Association</a></p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "bodyText": "Steve McQueen on Paul Gilroy The first book I read by Paul Gilroy was There Ain\u2019t No Black in the Union Jack. I was 19 and studying fine art at Goldsmiths, and it turned my head like nothing before. For a young person looking for answers and clues, to have that sort of book was eye-opening. It uncovered and revealed things. And then I read his masterpiece, The Black Atlantic. It was huge. His ideas about modernity and double-consciousness represented a major shift in thinking throughout the world. That book spoke to so many people. The way his books tell the stories of black lives is surgical and detailed, and at the same time poetic. I think that\u2019s important: truth has to be communicated, but it also has to be felt. His work has been a springboard for so many people \u2013 artists, musicians, actors. It has a foundational quality that allows you to jump off. It propels you and allows you to go even further. He was teaching at Goldsmiths when I was studying there, so I knocked on the door of his office and started asking him all these questions. He welcomed me inside and started to talk to me. This was Paul Gilroy \u2013 the premier intellectual of the UK, if not Europe and the world \u2013 and I was a 19-year-old kid! I was probably asking the most embarrassing things, but he\u2019d send me off with books to read and essays to write. He had this enormous patience and generosity. What\u2019s interesting about Paul is that he cares about getting things done. He doesn\u2019t care about who people think he is, or about being known. It\u2019s all about evidence, and the work finding an audience: he wants to be in the public consciousness, not in the public eye. He\u2019s an unsung hero, but consciously so. He\u2019s not interested in being anyone\u2019s hero. Steve McQueen is a British film producer, screenwriter and video artist, and the director of films including Blitz and 12 Years a Slave Vivienne Acheampong on Afua Hirsch I have been an admirer of Afua Hirsch\u2019s work for about 10 years. When I first came across her, as a Black British woman of Ghanian heritage I formed a connection instantly. Her ability to amplify the stories of Black lives past and present was something that I was in awe of. Her book Brit(ish): On Race, Identity and Belonging resonated with me so deeply I can honestly say it transformed my life. She conveyed so profoundly what it is to be Black and British, and to be part of the diaspora, bringing such a nuanced perspective around race in a way that I hadn\u2019t experienced before. Hirsch consistently confronts, challenges and exposes truths about Britain\u2019s colonial past and its impact on contemporary racial dynamics, and how it still has an influence on racial inequality today. I love how she celebrates Africa and all the riches and beauty it has to offer, something that we rarely get to witness in mainstream media. Her TV series Africa Rising was uplifting and joyous to watch, highlighting the arts and culture pouring out of our great continent and its ongoing reinvention and growing influence on the global stage. I again devoured her most recent book, Decolonising My Body, which powerfully explores how our Black bodies have been influenced by colonialism, and how we can reclaim our traditions to redefine our own beauty standards. Quite frankly, Afua Hirsch is a hero to me. Her activism, pursuit of positive change and ability to empower other Black voices to tell our own stories is something I am for ever inspired by. Vivienne Acheampong is an actor and comedian best known for playing Lucienne in the Netflix series The Sandman, and her appearances in BBC3\u2019s Famalam. Clive Myrie on Frederick Douglass The task of telling the story of Black lives can simply mean providing depth and context around the actions of Black people in certain situations, historical or contemporary, to correct a false record. Writers such as Gary Younge and David Olusoga, in my opinion, properly contextualise Black lives and correct narratives, helping reframe stories from Black perspectives and enriching our understanding of Black lives lived. However, I have decided to focus on a figure from the 19th century as someone I revere for telling the stories of Black lives, who did so not only through the written word but also photographs. Frederick Douglass, the social reformer, abolitionist and statesman, became the most important campaigner for African American civil rights and human rights in general in the Victorian era. Born into slavery, he escaped at the age of 20, but having learned to read as a boy, he went on to become one of the great writers and dazzling orators of his era. He travelled the world speaking in the newly built Victorian meeting halls to packed and rapt audiences on abolition and racism, women\u2019s rights, female suffrage and workers\u2019 rights. He often equated his own suffering with the universal struggles of people throughout the world for freedom and respect. But there\u2019s more to this great man than the spoken and written word. (He wrote no less than three autobiographies; I\u2019ve struggled to write one!) There are 160 known photographic portraits of Douglass, and that\u2019s a lot. He is in fact one of the most photographed Americans of the 19th century, and in controlling his image, he controlled his own narrative. Was he just vain? Well, he was a good-looking dude and he knew it, never seen without a natty cravat and immaculate frock coat. But I think Douglass also understood the revolutionary potential of the image. The camera showed the truth. It forced the viewer to engage with the subject on a human level and it could be reproduced over and over, reaching millions of people through books, pamphlets and newspapers. That image could change minds. Most pictures of Black people in the 19th century were gross caricatures, racist stereotypes, grotesque minstrels or of lynching victims. Douglass presents himself as a handsome well-dressed man, sitting on well-upholstered chairs, sometimes with a book or papers at hand. He is dignified, intelligent, with a glimpse of the fighter in his eyes. There is one other rather radical photo showing himself with his second wife, who was white, and her sister. He is seated, his wife stands over him: a role reversal of the conventions of Victorian portraiture. A radical image, of a piece with a radical man. Clive Myrie is a BBC News presenter, foreign correspondent and hosts Mastermind Abena Oppong-Asare on Paul Boateng Paul Boateng tells our story past and present. He belongs to a generation of political leaders who broke through the barriers of racial discrimination. He inspires me, not only because he cleared a path for a Ghanaian-heritage girl such as me to contemplate a career in public service, but also because of what he did next. He is part of that vital 1987 breakthrough into an all-white House of Commons. He was the first Black government minister, and then the first Black cabinet minister. As a minister in the Blair government, he tackled child poverty, fought for disabled people, and at the Treasury delivered billions to Britain\u2019s public services. He was the UK\u2019s high commissioner to post-apartheid South Africa. Now he sits in the House of Lords, sharing his wisdom and articulating his fierce passion for justice. He\u2019s also a brilliant chancellor of my local University of Greenwich. Some tabloids scoffed when he declared at his election count \u201ctoday Brent South, tomorrow Soweto\u201d, but he was right and they were wrong. We take it for granted that there should be Black MPs, but in the 1980s plenty of people disapproved. Even today Black MPs are sadly abused, delegitimised and confused for one another. It is assumed so often that a new Black MP must be in the wrong place. Yet thanks to Paul, alongside Diane Abbott and Bernie Grant, we are here, and we\u2019re staying. Lord Boateng proves that passion plus determination moves mountains. And as he shows whenever I catch up with him in parliament, in politics you can be kind as well as tough. Abena Oppong-Asare is MP for Erith and Thamesmead and parliamentary secretary to the Cabinet Office Nels Abbey on Arikana Chihombori-Quao In western media Arikana Chihombori-Quao, the former African Union ambassador to the US, is a nobody. Practically anonymous. Yet in western diplomatic circles operating in Africa (notably the French), she is a dagger in the ribcage. Most importantly, however, to Africans at home and in the diaspora, Chihombori-Quao is a rock-star historian and political thinker. What makes the Zimbabwean-born doctor turned diplomat famous in certain diplomatic circles is exactly what makes her one of Africa\u2019s most beloved intellectuals (and perhaps the only African diplomat most people could name). She tells deeply inconvenient truths, with a knack for joining the dots between the atrocities of the past and the disasters of the present. She doesn\u2019t just chronicle and contextualise African history, but uses it as a powerful force to inspire the children of Africa to right the seemingly permanent wrongs of the past in a bid to create a more prosperous, powerful and harmonious future. Chihombori-Quao\u2019s speeches on France\u2019s continued colonial activity in Africa, such as currency issuance and fixing, compulsory foreign exchange deposits and first-refusal rights on resources, earned her the sack from the African Union. The same speeches went on to form the intellectual basis for the slew of popular revolutions (some would say \u201ccoups\u201d) that have swept across former French colonies in Africa (namely: Burkina Faso, Chad, Gabon, Guinea, Mali and Niger) since 2020. Chihombori-Quao\u2019s most important work, however, has been to bring into public consciousness the damning legacy of the 1884 Berlin conference, which formalised the European colonisation of Africa and, catastrophically, balkanised Africa into perpetual economic nonstarters. Her powerful use of illustrative examples in this regard, including the normalised insanity of microeconomies such as Djibouti, Togo and Burundi being expected to compete with the US, China and Germany, have rendered her one of this generation\u2019s leading pan-Africans. Nels Abbey is an author and broadcaster Maxine Watson on Marlon James I recently read the novel The Trees by Percival Everett. It takes the case of Emmett Till, the 14-year-old black boy lynched in Mississippi in 1955, for allegedly whistling at a white woman, and turns it into a modern murder mystery with a touch of the supernatural. It struck me as a compelling way of not only bringing black history to life but also of offering us a chance to have an opinion and express a view on narratives often written about us by others. Black authors who use historic events as the basis for their work perhaps do so as a way of reclaiming the past and rewriting the narrative to explore it with a full-on black gaze. No one does it as uncompromisingly as Marlon James. His A Brief History of Seven Killings, based on the near fatal shooting of reggae icon Bob Marley in 1976, hits you like a sucker punch. James seeks to locate the players: the \u201cbad man\u201d who run and control the tenement yards of downtown Kingston, within the reality of Jamaican life. They are imbued with dimensions and a humanity that shines through the brutality. James, a black, gay, Jamaican native, brings all of this to bear on the world he creates. There is an authenticity and complexity to the inner lives of his characters that can only be achieved when written by someone with black skin in the game. His 2009 novel The Book of Night Women is no exception. There are no passive enslaved women here. Each has agency and a point of view. Their voices are rich and varied within a hierarchy of their own making. James\u2019s writing is bold and audacious for sure \u2013 but, like a black cowboy at a Texan rodeo, it is his ability to wrangle our history and bend it so perfectly to his will that sets him apart, and makes him an unflinching and unapologetic chronicler of our story. TV executive Maxine Watson is an award winning former BBC documentary commissioner and producer Daniel Kebede on James Baldwin As we await the US election, I\u2019m reminded of what James Baldwin said during the 1980 presidential race. In an essay for the Nation, he unpicked with customary wit and insight how the political system had failed Black people. Evoking Gabriel on Judgment Day, he writes: \u201cThe children are always ours, every single one of them, all over the globe; and I am beginning to suspect that whoever is incapable of recognising this may be incapable of morality.\u201d In his centenary year, Baldwin still communicates an important message of human equality. As someone at the forefront of the civil rights movement for decades, we would do well to keep his eloquent words in our heads when we see conflict and unrest the world over. My thoughts are always for the plight of children, and what we can do to make their lives better and to set an example for the next generation. Raised in Harlem during the Great Depression, Baldwin saw poverty with his own eyes every day. That experience never leaves you. It shapes you, and in later life it drove him to articulate the voice of the disfranchised. He understood the power of words. His penetrating insights are nothing without his persuasive prose. And if that meant a bit of righteous anger too, then all the better. Daniel Kebede is general secretary of the National Education Union, the largest education union in Europe Natasha Beckles on Toni Morrison Toni Morrison is the storyteller\u2019s storyteller: the psychological midwife; the Melchizedek prophet-priest who blessed me as a teenager through exquisite words and epigenetically remembered histories. Chloe Anthony Morrison, born Chloe Ardelia Wofford, expressed in essays and demonstrated in interviews a devastating gift of situational insight. Her books were like tents made of seminal statements that opened liminal spaces, into which sojourning readers might enter and discover something about themselves and the world. Her writing is unflinching, uncompromising and unapologetic in its intent. Her unblinking stare and healing hands anoint the faces of racialised people, honouring their \u201cliving while Black\u201d experiences. Mother Toni\u2019s work exposes whiteness in its atomic genesis, its epidemic acceleration, its systemic and generational violence without ever really giving it the time of day. Instead, she devotes her energy to each of her characters \u2013 kissing their tears, recording their trauma, testifying to their humanity with whispers of love, wisdom and compassion \u2013 while allowing the legacy of their learnings and philosophy to irrigate the observant heart. Her writing takes stories of terror and bends time to hold them tight and precious, stitching them together in love and dignity like jewels. Never to glorify the horror but always to teach the reader to see the faces and not turn away from those who are unseen and not comforted. Her epistemological grip within bewilderingly difficult human experiences taught me to stay present, to think and feel past the entirely appropriate responses of shock, rage, fight or flight. She taught me to find equanimity and resistance by being with myself and others, in the moment. St Toni loaned me respectful hands and arms to truly embrace those who mourn. She taught me how to bear witness to love and hope, by listening and attending to human testimony until the grief within the speaker, the listener and the reader, finds its peace. She curated rooms where self-compassion and courage flourished. That has shaped my leadership and my priesthood. Natasha Beckles is rector of St Nicholas church, Perivale, west London Dean Forbes on Akala My introduction to Akala was through the songs Shakespeare and Find No Enemy. To get a sense of his work, that\u2019s a great place to start. Then listen to any of his Fire in the Booth performance and you\u2019ll hear the freestyle version of him, which is the first version I came across and where his skills really shine. I\u2019ve always been a fan of rap, especially music that has brilliant vocabulary, sharp lyrical content and strong storytelling. Those things all stood out to me when I first heard Akala. What drew me in was his ability to represent topics that are not usually represented in rap music and hip-hop: topics around our heritage, the oppression black people have faced, and his overall societal observations. Akala grew up in a working-class background, just like me, and on the surface he presents as a kind of stereotype: black guy, rapper, not very clean-cut, no suit and tie in sight. But then he opens his mouth \u2013 and what he comes out with is so unexpected, yet so profound. He\u2019s incredibly educated, articulate and able to make his point in such a measured way \u2013 whether that\u2019s addressing the Oxford Union, facing off against someone with an opposing view on Question Time, or in his book Natives. Akala does two things that are very important. First, he\u2019s one of the most relevant spokespeople for the black community, as often a protest is to shout and bang our fists and demand action; and in the most beautiful and elegant way, he challenges racial stereotypes with points that are substantive, well-researched and founded in education, without bluster and emotion. I actually met him a couple of weeks ago. It was at a mutual friend\u2019s party and we were listening to hip-hop and reggae and having a whale of a time. You\u2019re always anxious about meeting someone you hold in high regard in case they let you down, but he was as brilliant, articulate, challenging and engaging as I had hoped he would be. Dean Forbes is CEO of tech company Forterro, Chairman of Forbes Family Group and has been named the most influential Black Briton in this year\u2019s Powerlist Micha Frazer-Carroll on Angela Davis At the turn of the millennium, my primary school celebrated with a dress-up day. We all had to dress as a significant figure from the past 100 years. Aged six, I had no shortage of Spice Girls in my class. But my mum decided to style me as Angela Davis, complete with an afro wig and flared jeans. I had no idea who the American Black feminist scholar and activist was, but looking back at age 30, I feel a strong sense of pride in my mum\u2019s radicalism. My present-day work as a Black feminist writer has been completely shaped by Davis\u2019s thinking, which attempts to transform the material injustices of Black life. In addressing issues that affect Black people globally, Davis puts forward unapologetically radical solutions. When I was 23, my mum gifted me a copy of Davis\u2019s book Freedom Is a Constant Struggle, which was my first introduction to the concept of prison abolition. Having been engaged in the Black Lives Matter movement for years, the idea seemed unthinkable and exhilarating. Davis\u2019s ability to connect the Black struggle to issues of state, gender, class and the economy was firmly rooted in her experience as a Black working-class lesbian and prisoner in the 1970s. When I was 24, I was invited to a Black feminist symposium at Cambridge (my alma mater) that Davis attended. The energy in the room, which was filled with Black female student activists, was electrifying. This was the woman whose work had directly informed initiatives such as FLY, Cambridge\u2019s consciousness-raising group for women of colour, which had been such a crucial lifeline for Black female students at an overwhelmingly white university. Myself and a friend ended up mingling in a circle with Davis, and found ourselves speechless, giggling schoolgirlish messes when the time came to introduce ourselves. Unable to articulate the way she has helped me understand Black womanhood, I wonder if I was a little transported back to being that six-year-old in the Davis wig. Micha Frazer-Carroll is a journalist and author of Mad World: The Politics of Mental Health Mike Gayle on Donald Rodney I\u2019d never heard of the late Birmingham-born artist Donald Rodney until I happened across his work at the Nottingham Contemporary gallery earlier this month. But when I was asked to think about who I admire for telling the stories of Black lives, his name jumped into my head. It\u2019s an indicator of just how impactful the show, Visceral Canker, is, that of all the Black people who have inspired me, he came to the fore. The show, a collection of his work from 1982 to 1997, spoke profoundly of what it means to be Black and British. In addition, it drew attention to what it means to live with constant pain and be in and out of hospital, as he was as a sufferer of sickle-cell anaemia, a disease that eventually claimed his life at the age of 36. For Rodney, who first studied art in Bournville in Birmingham, then later Nottingham and London, art could be personal and political. That\u2019s a position powerfully established in the photographic work Flesh of My Flesh, which features a brutal and unflinching close-up of his own hip scar \u2013 caused by a surgeon who believed Black skin was so tough that it needed more stitches than white. His 1992 piece Doublethink, made of cheap sporting trophies engraved with the casually racist statements he\u2019d gathered from various sources over time, is equally powerful. It serves as a reminder, if one were needed, of how white society venerates Black excellence on the sporting field while denigrating Black society away from it. His work as a whole is at once thought-provoking, enraging and deeply moving. Despite the almost 30 years since his passing, it is still blisteringly relevant today. Mike Gayle is the bestselling author of All The Lonely People, Half a World Away and A Song of Me and You. His 20th novel, Hope Street, will be published in February 2025 Kimberley Bownes on David Olusoga David Olusoga is a historian but also a storyteller. When he tells the stories of black lives, he does so with all the knowledge and credibility of someone who has done the research, but the way he talks about his own story and background makes him very relatable. He\u2019s telling stories for black Britons, and I don\u2019t feel that happens often enough. I first came across him when his 2016 BBC series, Black and British: A Forgotten History, was rebroadcast in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd. All of the history I\u2019d been taught at school had been about significant white players, and this was the first I\u2019d learned about the history of black British people. It was the first time I really felt a connection to British history. It gave me a sense of validation, and it kind of blew me away. Last year, he came to speak at the National Black Police Association conference in south Wales. He talked about the impact and history of racism and policing, and how the government around the 1950s painted a picture to the public about the threat that black people coming to the country would pose. Yet simultaneously the government was encouraging migration from West Indian colonies. He told us how, at the time, the government had gone to several chief constables and asked them to conduct research to prove their theory that black people were the cause of all the problems in society. It was really useful to understand the distrust between black communities and policing, and how far back it goes. I think that\u2019s something that should be taught to police officers and importantly future generations in policing, so they understand this is intergenerational trauma and can help build empathy when interacting with black communities. Olusoga honestly opened my eyes to a lot of these things. I just wish more people would watch his programmes and read his books.

      "body": "<p>At the age of 13, Luke Evans faced an impossible choice \u2013 either be true to himself and embrace his sexuality, or stay true to God. If he told his Jehovah\u2019s Witness parents that he was gay, they would be honour-bound to inform the church elders, and that would be the end of life as he knew it. If he didn\u2019t tell them, he would be forced into a world of deceit or denial. He chose God.</p> <p>Evans became the youngest boy in his south Wales congregation to be baptised. He formally and publicly devoted his life to Jehovah. If he came out as gay now, he would be banished from the church. All upstanding members of the congregation, including his mother and father, would be expected to break off contact with him; to act as if he was dead or simply had never existed.</p> <p>Today, Evans is a Hollywood regular, cast in blockbusters such as Fast and Furious 6; in The Hobbit trilogy as Bard the Bowman; in Tamara Drewe and Blitz as a love interest for Gemma Arterton and Zawe Ashton respectively, and in Immortals as the Greek god Zeus. He is one of few out gay actors cast as straight leading men and action heroes. But what a punishing odyssey he has been on to get there. One that involves running away from home at 16, living the lie that he had always feared, being expelled from his church, and eventually coming out as gay twice \u2013 once in the UK when starting out in musical theatre, then years later in Hollywood as a superstar. His life would make a fabulous movie.</p> <p>Evans has now written his memoir, Boy from the Valleys. It\u2019s a sober title for a remarkable and shocking story. The 45-year-old grew up in Aberbargoed, a tiny town in south Wales that was home to the largest colliery waste tip in Europe. It also contained an improbable number of devout Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, two of whom were his parents. The way Evans describes his father, David, he could have just as easily been a budding pop star as a young man. \u201cHe was the Harry Styles of the Valleys \u2013 waif-like, handsome, beautiful skin, with floppy hair,\u201d Evans tells me. On 31 December 1975, David decided to devote himself to Jehovah because he had heard that Armageddon was happening that night, and he wanted to be on the right side. He rushed over to his girlfriend Yvonne to tell her the news. God was about to destroy the wicked, resurrect the dead and transform the Earth back into a paradise where the righteous could live in harmony, free from violence, disease and death.</p>    <p>David and Yvonne turned on the television and waited for an update. Although Armageddon didn\u2019t happen that night, they still became devout Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. They devoted themselves to God, worshipped at their local Kingdom Hall, married, and in 1979 Luke, their only child, was born. Evans says the three of them were inseparable, which made what was to happen later even more traumatic.</p> <p>Evans is speaking to me from Portland, Oregon, where he\u2019s currently shooting a film, playing yet another macho man. But for now he\u2019s transported himself back to his childhood. His earliest memories are of knocking on the doors of strangers with his parents, attempting to convert them to the faith.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Knocking on strangers\u2019 doors, knowing that what we were about to say they didn\u2019t want to hear, was terrifying</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Growing up, he says, was in many ways wonderful. \u201cMy childhood was full of love, especially from my mam. Dad was the breadwinner.\u201d While David kept the family afloat as a bricklayer, Yvonne gave as much of herself to young Luke as she did to God. \u201cEvery morning, I\u2019d climb into bed with them on my mam\u2019s side before I went to school,\u201d Evans recalls. He was an extremely picky eater; his mum used to bribe him with Polo sweets to eat a sliver of carrot or a pea. \u201cMam was&nbsp;the one who sat with me patiently when I wouldn\u2019t eat food.\u201d Yet so many of his childhood memories are&nbsp;horrific. There was the door-knocking with his parents \u2013 even today, it upsets him to think about it. \u201cKnocking on a stranger\u2019s door, knowing that what we were about to say they didn\u2019t want to hear, was terrifying. I hated it. In the summer holidays, we knocked on doors even more than when I was at school. Three hours on a Wednesday, the whole day on Friday, then the weekend.\u201d</p> <p>He was expected to shout his allegiance to Jehovah from the mountaintop. Whenever he entered a new class at school, it was his responsibility to address his teacher and fellow pupils about the rules of his religion. At secondary school, there were nine Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, but as the only boy he was designated to do the explaining. \u201cI had to stand up and say, \u2018We don\u2019t do Christmas, we don\u2019t do Easter, we don\u2019t do birthdays and we don\u2019t do assembly in the morning.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>His peers taunted him as \u201cJovey\u201d or \u201cBible-basher\u201d. But that was just the start of it. By the time he was seven, they had decided he was different in another way. That\u2019s when the name-calling got worse: \u201cBender\u201d, \u201cGay boy\u201d. Sometimes the insults were accompanied by floppy-wrist gestures. At first, he didn\u2019t even know what it all meant, or why he was being targeted. But it didn\u2019t take him long to work it out.</p> <p>\u201cWhat hurt the most was being pushed away. Somebody not wanting to sit next to me in class. At break time, not having anyone to hang out with or being safe in a crowd or gang. I didn\u2019t have one. The girls who were Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses had their own group and everyone else just seemed to merge into their little group and I didn\u2019t find mine. That was the hardest part. It\u2019s a terrible thing for a child to have to think, what\u2019s wrong with me? I felt like I was dirty, like I had a disease. I had to keep analysing what it was about me that was making them do this: was it my voice? Was it that I was slightly effeminate?\u201d</p>    <p>By the time he was in secondary school, he knew he was gay. He wanted to tell his mother that he was being bullied, but couldn\u2019t. He was terrified he would go door-knocking with his parents, and one of the bullies would open the door and hurl homophobic abuse at him. \u201cMy mam and dad had no idea I was going through all of that. But when I was in a situation where this could be exposed to them, it terrified me.\u201d Terror is a word he returns to time and again.</p> <p>Does he think the door-knocking helped bring out the actor in him? \u201cNo, it didn\u2019t give me anything other than terror. I simply hated it.\u201d He pauses. There was something that did help him discover his talent for performance, he says. Twice a week, on Thursday and Sunday, he would have to attend his local Kingdom Hall with his parents. Every so often, he\u2019d be assigned to read a passage from the Bible and explain its significance. \u201cAfter the talk, the elders would give advice on how to improve it. They\u2019d say, \u2018Use more illustrations\u2019 or \u2018Pause for emphasis\u2019 or \u2018Use repetition\u2019.\u201d In the early days, he loved that aspect of being a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, just as he loved dressing up in a suit and the sense of belonging. But none of that compensated for the downsides.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>All that was in my head was: if I don\u2019t sort this out, I\u2019m going to lose my mum and dad</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It seems strange that you dedicated yourself to Jehovah with your baptism at 13 when you were sure you were gay, I say. He nods, but explains that he regarded it as his final chance of salvation. \u201cI thought maybe by doing that, the rest would disappear. I was so confused, and I had no one to talk to. The only thing I could talk about to people I knew was the religion. It consumed our conversation. I thought, well, focus on something else and hope the other thing goes away.\u201d Was it as conscious as that? \u201cYes, this could take me away from my thoughts; the bad things. Every night in the congregation they read scriptures saying terrible things about the way I was feeling and who I was possibly turning into. All that was in my head was: if I don\u2019t sort this out, I\u2019m going to lose my mum and dad. I\u2019m going to lose everything I\u2019ve ever known and I\u2019m also going to die at Armageddon, so I\u2019m giving myself a death sentence unless I sort his out.\u201d And you believed the death sentence? \u201cYep, 100%.\u201d</p> <p>What was more frightening \u2013 the thought of being disowned by your parents or Armageddon? Oh, Evans says instantly, losing his parents. \u201cThe only thing that mattered to me was my mam and dad. I didn\u2019t really care about the dying bit once I realised who I was and what I needed to do to be who I was. To be happy, there was only one route I could take, and my only worry was that I\u2019d lose Mam and Dad in the small period I had before Armageddon came. I had to make this decision: either you keep lying and live this life that is making you very unhappy or you take the risk and hope they don\u2019t cut you off and pretend that you are dead.\u201d The religion seems so unforgiving, I say. \u201cIt is,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s inhumane.\u201d</p> <p>At one point, his father discovered gay porn and literature in Evans\u2019 bedroom. Without mentioning it to his son, he burned it. When Evans asked his mother about where his stash had gone, she told him, but said that she didn\u2019t want to know about his sexuality; the implications were too terrible.</p> <p>At 16, Evans left school and town for Cardiff and a new life. He decided that was the only way he could hold on to his parents while being true to himself. He got an admin job in a finance company and began a relationship with his line manager, Tom, 20 years his senior. An anonymous letter was sent to personnel exposing the relationship, and Tom was fired. The couple could see no future for themselves.</p> <p>Evans describes his life as a series of \u201csliding doors\u201d moments, and this is when the biggest door opened. Tom was friendly with an exceptionally wealthy couple who invited them to stay. That night, they discussed Tom\u2019s dismissal from work. Evans, still a shy teenager, revealed that he liked to sing. After some cajoling, he agreed to perform Danny Boy for them. The next morning, the friends said they had a proposition \u2013 they would hire Tom to manage their trust fund and support Evans financially to put him through music and drama&nbsp;school.</p> <p>This is where Evans\u2019 story starts to verge on the implausible. At the age of 16, he was living in London<strong> </strong>with Tom in a luxury block of flats whose residents included Cilla Black. When he looked out of the window, he could see Andrew Lloyd Webber in his apartment opposite. Even today, Evans\u2019 eyes are on stalks when he describes the luxury he was living in. He throws back his head and rocks with laughter at the ludicrousness of it all. \u201cI <em>know</em>, right!\u201d he says. \u201c<em>Exactly</em>!\u201d In his memoir, he refers to the Dracula-like teeth at the back of his mouth, and when he\u2019s laughing I can see them. Fangs apart, he\u2019s James Bond handsome, with a jawline sharp enough to chop wood.</p> <p>After he left for London, he told his parents that Tom was his landlord and rarely at home because he travelled for business. David and Yvonne accepted the story happily. Meanwhile, Evans studied at the London Studio Centre for a three-year diploma in musical theatre, where his tutors recognised him as a star in the making. He had a great time \u2013 partying, shagging, doing drugs.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, his relationship suffered. He and Tom began to feel their age difference, and split up. Evans suddenly found himself a typically impoverished, house-sharing student. The only difference was that when other students went home for the holidays, he felt he couldn\u2019t. He was now 19, broke and feeling bleak in a way he hadn\u2019t for three years. He hated lying to his parents, and was more frightened than ever of losing them. He confessed all to his mother, telling her that Tom had been his boyfriend, they had split up, and he was now living a lifestyle impossible to reconcile with being a Jehovah\u2019s Witness. Yvonne took it in her stride, but did not tell his father. She was as fearful of losing Luke as he was of losing her.</p>      <p>Evans was in his early 20s and working in musical theatre when an interview he had done with gay publication the Advocate, in which he discussed his homosexuality, came to the attention of the Jehovah\u2019s Witness elders. They left a message on his phone saying if it was true that he was a \u201cpractising homosexual\u201d he would be disfellowshipped \u2013 kicked out of the church. The elders demanded he return to Aberbargoed for his punishment. Evans ignored the summons. Instead, he called Yvonne, who agreed it was now time to tell David.</p> <p>His father was devastated, reminded Evans he would die at Armageddon, and told him he was going for a walk. By the time he returned, David had realised he could not break off contact with his son. In absentia, Evans was disfellowshipped; his parents were there to witness his humiliation. I ask Evans how the elders would have worded it. \u201cThey would have said, \u2018Luke Evans is no longer a member of the Christian congregation.\u2019 The subtext is: \u2018You can no longer speak to him, have any relationship with him, he is an outcast, he is now not part of any of our lives.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Was it a relief when he was disfellowshipped? \u201cYes, but it was painful, because I knew my mam and dad were sitting in that Kingdom Hall surrounded by people that knew them and knew me until I was 16. It must have been a horrible moment for them. I think they just went home, hugged each other and got through it. <em>Ptffftssssch</em>.\u201d He exhales loudly, slowly, as if he\u2019s been&nbsp;punctured.</p> <p>His parents proved heroic, he says. They didn\u2019t cast him out, nor did they give up on the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. Somehow they managed to stay true to both. And this is where his feelings about the religion become surprisingly nuanced. \u201cI should be very angry, but I don\u2019t feel it. Because while all this stuff that was happening to me was not pleasant, and I\u2019d never want anyone else to go through it, I see two people who have found a life that works for them. They have wonderful friends, inside and outside the religion.\u201d He stops. \u201cBut if it doesn\u2019t work for somebody, they should have the right to say so. \u2018I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019ve really, really tried, can I go? Is it OK?\u2019 And that\u2019s the bit you can\u2019t do once you get baptised.\u201d</p>    <p>Evans went on to enjoy enough success in musical theatre (the romantic lead in a touring production of Miss Saigon, Taboo, Piaf and Rent Remixed in the West End)<strong> </strong>to help his parents out when his father got sick and could no longer work. He bought the house next door to his parents for them to rent out, providing them with an income. Every so often, the elders would knock on their door and tell David and Yvonne that they knew they were still in touch with Luke and that it was a sin. David comes across in the book as obedient to the point of meekness. But there came a time when he\u2019d had enough. Evans quotes David\u2019s heroic speech to the elders in his book: \u201cWhen I got sick, who put petrol in the car? Who paid for the electricity? Who paid for the food in the fridge? Was it you? No, it was our son.\u201d As I read the passage aloud to Evans, he wells up. It goes on: \u201cEven though you tried to keep us away from him, has Luke ever told us to leave the church? No. He\u2019s moved as far as he possibly can from us so he wouldn\u2019t bring reproach on the religion, and you\u2019re still trying to drag him back into this. Well, never again. Don\u2019t come to our house and tell us not to speak to our son, because if it wasn\u2019t for him we wouldn\u2019t even have this house.\u201d Evans weeps, his words coming out in choked spasms. \u201cYeah \u2026 yeah \u2026 it\u2019s an incredible thing.\u201d He smiles through his tears. \u201cGood on him!\u201d David lost his privileges in the church and was struck off from being a ministerial servant, one step below becoming an elder. And still, despite everything, David and Yvonne remain in the church today.</p> <p>I notice a tattoo circling his forearm. It looks like a&nbsp;thinly sketched trace of a heartbeat. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a D, Y and an L, for David, Yvonne and Luke \u2013 my dad, my mam and me,\u201d Evans says. \u201cIt\u2019s eternal. We\u2019ve been through everything together and I think we will be for&nbsp;ever linked.\u201d Another smile. \u201cIt\u2019s my first tattoo. I&nbsp;was 39. I thought, the only way I\u2019m going to get around this with my mam is to say that I did it with the letters of their names. And it worked a treat!\u201d At 45, he admits he is still a mummy\u2019s boy. \u201cWhen my mam doesn\u2019t like something, I still feel it. I want to please them.\u201d</p> <p>At 30, Evans had another crisis. His career in musical theatre felt precarious. He could go for months without a job, and it wasn\u2019t getting any more secure for him. \u201cI thought, am I still going to be renting a room in a shared flat in 20 years\u2019 time?\u201d </p> <p>He considered giving up theatre for a dull but stable job \u2013 something in the service industry, perhaps. Musical theatre was demanding, and yet it was patronised by so many in the industry \u2013 he was seen as a mere hoofer, not a real actor. He had tried to break into straight theatre to no avail. When he asked his agent to put him up for a part in Peter Gill\u2019s Small Change, about two Welsh boys, the agent told him he was reaching beyond himself. So Evans wrote to the casting director himself \u2013 and ended up getting the job. Another sliding door moment. From there, he got himself a new British agent, then an American one, and within weeks, he was offered the part of Apollo in the remake of Clash of the Titans.</p> <p>It was bonkers, he says. Little Luke Evans who couldn\u2019t get regular work in the West End was then cast in film after film. Five of them in his first year. The more movies he made, the more he found himself in demand and the bigger the paycheque. Hollywood decided he was a natural action man. His sexuality was never questioned. \u201cI played straight rugged masculine men. I am queer, but I present in a masculine way. And&nbsp;thank God, in a way, because bloody hell, I&nbsp;wouldn\u2019t&nbsp;have had the career I\u2019ve had if I presented any other way.\u201d</p> <p>Has he seen any of the school bullies since he\u2019s been making a living playing macho men? \u201cHahaha! It is <em>quite brilliant</em>,<em> </em>isn\u2019t it? It does make me giggle. No, I&nbsp;haven\u2019t.\u201d He made his breakthrough in the era of the Twilight films, when the vogue was for men in touch with their feminine side. \u201cThere were a lot of pretty, young, muscle-bound twinks with no stubble and beautiful big doe eyes that could turn into wolves. But there weren\u2019t a lot of me \u2013 Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton. There was a very small pot of these late-20s, early-30s masculine-presenting men, and I fitted into that category without even trying.\u201d</p>      <p>One day, he walked along the red carpet at a premiere with a female friend. The Daily Mail decided she was his girlfriend and reported it in a gossip column. His management team advised him to say nothing, and he went along with it. But he felt uncomfortable. Although he\u2019d never suggested he was straight, he felt complicit in his silence. Now he began to worry he would be exposed as gay, despite the fact that he had outed himself 20 years earlier and everybody in his life knew he was gay.</p> <p>Sure enough, the rumours began on social media. Trolls suggested Evans was living a lie. They dug up the 2002 interview in the Advocate where he\u2019d talked about refusing to be closeted. Yet as an emerging movie star, he had become coy about his sexuality, for example telling <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/advice/a3177/luke-evans-on-what-you-need-to-know/\">Cosmopolitan in 2010</a> that he hoped to adopt three dogs and \u201cshare them with someone else\u201d. Having lived with homophobic abuse for so much of his life, it was now people in the gay community who began to taunt him.</p> <p>It lasted for three years, and almost broke Evans. \u201cIt brought back an immense amount of PTSD that was connected to what I felt like when I was a kid, thinking I was going to lose my mam and dad.\u201d The thing is, he says, nobody had asked him directly. And if they had, he would have told them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There was a lot of hate. I was being treated as if I\u2019d turned my back on my identity and the community I was a strong part of</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The comments were hideous, including \u201cI hope he dies of Aids\u201d. When he talks about it, you can hear the exasperation in his voice. \u201cThe first thing is they don\u2019t know who they\u2019re talking about. They don\u2019t know me. I didn\u2019t just live as a gay man, I sacrificed all of my childhood friends. I had to move out at 16. I had to navigate London, drugs, sex, with no one to fall back on apart from the new people I\u2019d found in my life. There was never a point where I was ashamed. I had a plan from the age of 12 to escape because I wanted to be the person I am.\u201d He reddens in anger. \u201cThere was a lot of hate. I was being treated as if I\u2019d turned my back on my identity and the community I was a strong part of.\u201d</p> <p>How did he get through it? \u201cBy throwing myself into work and keeping my real friends close to me. Whenever I wasn\u2019t on a film set I was with my friends in London living the most normal of lives. My team was really supportive and I was ready for the conversation when it came up.\u201d</p> <p>When promoting the film Dracula Untold in 2014, he was asked by <a href=\"https://wwd.com/feature/slaying-them-softly-7973152-1009820/\">Women\u2019s Wear Daily</a> if he was setting a new precedent as an openly gay action star. Evans replied: \u201cIt\u2019s good for people to look at me and think, this guy is doing his thing and enjoying what he\u2019s doing and successful at it and living his life.\u201d He waited for the fallout. \u201cI thought it could shatter my casting credibility. But that was all in my head because the jobs kept coming.\u201d Then the coin flipped again, he says, back to old-school homophobia. \u201cI was getting the roles over my straight counterparts. Some were very pissed&nbsp;off.\u201d</p> <p>Evans has overcome amazing odds to get to where he is today. It\u2019s inspiring, and yet at the same time there&nbsp;is something profoundly depressing that he is still an outlier; that Hollywood has made such little progress since the days when James Dean and Rock Hudson were forced to hide their sexuality to protect their careers. \u201cAnd Montgomery Clift,\u201d he adds with a smile. The redness has long subsided. \u201cI thought over a decade ago, you won\u2019t be on your own for long. Of course there are lots of gay actors, but playing the roles I\u2019m playing I don\u2019t think there\u2019s many.\u201d He tells me about the part he\u2019s filming in Portland for a TV series called Criminal, adapted from an Ed Brubaker comic. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m playing the hardest, darkest, most sinister straight man.\u201d</p> <p>How hard is he in real life? \u201cI can stand up for myself, which is something I couldn\u2019t do when I was a kid. Not that I really need to these days.\u201d Has playing hard-man roles toughened him up? \u201cThey\u2019ve definitely given me confidence. Maybe superficial confidence, but they have made me feel stronger in my shoes.\u201d</p> <p>In his memoir, he says that Ian McKellen was one of the first to recognise the glass ceiling Evans had broken through. The great actor and gay activist told him: \u201cOoh look at you, you\u2019re going to be a big butch star!\u201d It meant a lot to McKellen? \u201cIt did. He was very aware of the ground I was treading. I just hoped it would have moved further than it has.\u201d Can he think of any other out gay actors who would be cast in the part he\u2019s currently filming? He thinks about it. \u201cNo,\u201d he finally says. He makes it clear this is a regret, not a boast.</p> <p>Since coming out for the second time, Evans has rarely talked about his private life. In Boy from the Valleys, he lays it all before us \u2013 from his primary school crush on a rugby-playing teacher to his relationships with older men, dating the model and actor Jon Kortajarena, and the three years he\u2019s been with his current partner, Spanish architect Fran Tomas, with whom he has started a fashion and lifestyle business. He and Tomas share homes in London, Lisbon and Ibiza. Some days, he says, they think about having kids together; other times, they think they\u2019ll stick with their godchildren (Evans has five). He says he couldn\u2019t be more content. He has even managed to combine his movie career with singing \u2013 he\u2019s released two albums of cover songs, the last of which reached No 4 in the UK charts.</p> <p>As for the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, he believes they have taught him plenty. \u201cHaving doors slammed in my face from as early as I can remember put me in good stead for when I became an actor and didn\u2019t get a job. I didn\u2019t give a damn. I\u2019d be like, OK, all right, moving on. There\u2019s another 10 doors. I\u2019ll just keep knocking on them.\u201d As an actor, he\u2019s also extending his range \u2013 playing against type, as it were. Last year, he was hugely moving in the film Our Son, about two gay men whose relationship is breaking up and the impact it has on their child.</p> <p>He still insists that a person\u2019s sexuality should be an irrelevance. But, of course, he knows the reality is different. I ask what his life would be like now if he had stayed a Jehovah\u2019s Witness? \u201cI would have lived a very sad, isolated life, because I would have had to renounce my sexuality.\u201d Ultimately, Evans believes that walking away from his religion was a life or death decision for him. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I\u2019d be here today if that had been the life I\u2019d chosen to live,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u2022 Boy from the Valleys: My Unexpected Journey, by Luke Evans, published on 7 November by Ebury Spotlight at \u00a322.

      "bodyText": "At the age of 13, Luke Evans faced an impossible choice \u2013 either be true to himself and embrace his sexuality, or stay true to God. If he told his Jehovah\u2019s Witness parents that he was gay, they would be honour-bound to inform the church elders, and that would be the end of life as he knew it. If he didn\u2019t tell them, he would be forced into a world of deceit or denial. He chose God. Evans became the youngest boy in his south Wales congregation to be baptised. He formally and publicly devoted his life to Jehovah. If he came out as gay now, he would be banished from the church. All upstanding members of the congregation, including his mother and father, would be expected to break off contact with him; to act as if he was dead or simply had never existed. Today, Evans is a Hollywood regular, cast in blockbusters such as Fast and Furious 6; in The Hobbit trilogy as Bard the Bowman; in Tamara Drewe and Blitz as a love interest for Gemma Arterton and Zawe Ashton respectively, and in Immortals as the Greek god Zeus. He is one of few out gay actors cast as straight leading men and action heroes. But what a punishing odyssey he has been on to get there. One that involves running away from home at 16, living the lie that he had always feared, being expelled from his church, and eventually coming out as gay twice \u2013 once in the UK when starting out in musical theatre, then years later in Hollywood as a superstar. His life would make a fabulous movie. Evans has now written his memoir, Boy from the Valleys. It\u2019s a sober title for a remarkable and shocking story. The 45-year-old grew up in Aberbargoed, a tiny town in south Wales that was home to the largest colliery waste tip in Europe. It also contained an improbable number of devout Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, two of whom were his parents. The way Evans describes his father, David, he could have just as easily been a budding pop star as a young man. \u201cHe was the Harry Styles of the Valleys \u2013 waif-like, handsome, beautiful skin, with floppy hair,\u201d Evans tells me. On 31 December 1975, David decided to devote himself to Jehovah because he had heard that Armageddon was happening that night, and he wanted to be on the right side. He rushed over to his girlfriend Yvonne to tell her the news. God was about to destroy the wicked, resurrect the dead and transform the Earth back into a paradise where the righteous could live in harmony, free from violence, disease and death. David and Yvonne turned on the television and waited for an update. Although Armageddon didn\u2019t happen that night, they still became devout Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. They devoted themselves to God, worshipped at their local Kingdom Hall, married, and in 1979 Luke, their only child, was born. Evans says the three of them were inseparable, which made what was to happen later even more traumatic. Evans is speaking to me from Portland, Oregon, where he\u2019s currently shooting a film, playing yet another macho man. But for now he\u2019s transported himself back to his childhood. His earliest memories are of knocking on the doors of strangers with his parents, attempting to convert them to the faith. Growing up, he says, was in many ways wonderful. \u201cMy childhood was full of love, especially from my mam. Dad was the breadwinner.\u201d While David kept the family afloat as a bricklayer, Yvonne gave as much of herself to young Luke as she did to God. \u201cEvery morning, I\u2019d climb into bed with them on my mam\u2019s side before I went to school,\u201d Evans recalls. He was an extremely picky eater; his mum used to bribe him with Polo sweets to eat a sliver of carrot or a pea. \u201cMam was the one who sat with me patiently when I wouldn\u2019t eat food.\u201d Yet so many of his childhood memories are horrific. There was the door-knocking with his parents \u2013 even today, it upsets him to think about it. \u201cKnocking on a stranger\u2019s door, knowing that what we were about to say they didn\u2019t want to hear, was terrifying. I hated it. In the summer holidays, we knocked on doors even more than when I was at school. Three hours on a Wednesday, the whole day on Friday, then the weekend.\u201d He was expected to shout his allegiance to Jehovah from the mountaintop. Whenever he entered a new class at school, it was his responsibility to address his teacher and fellow pupils about the rules of his religion. At secondary school, there were nine Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, but as the only boy he was designated to do the explaining. \u201cI had to stand up and say, \u2018We don\u2019t do Christmas, we don\u2019t do Easter, we don\u2019t do birthdays and we don\u2019t do assembly in the morning.\u2019\u201d His peers taunted him as \u201cJovey\u201d or \u201cBible-basher\u201d. But that was just the start of it. By the time he was seven, they had decided he was different in another way. That\u2019s when the name-calling got worse: \u201cBender\u201d, \u201cGay boy\u201d. Sometimes the insults were accompanied by floppy-wrist gestures. At first, he didn\u2019t even know what it all meant, or why he was being targeted. But it didn\u2019t take him long to work it out. \u201cWhat hurt the most was being pushed away. Somebody not wanting to sit next to me in class. At break time, not having anyone to hang out with or being safe in a crowd or gang. I didn\u2019t have one. The girls who were Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses had their own group and everyone else just seemed to merge into their little group and I didn\u2019t find mine. That was the hardest part. It\u2019s a terrible thing for a child to have to think, what\u2019s wrong with me? I felt like I was dirty, like I had a disease. I had to keep analysing what it was about me that was making them do this: was it my voice? Was it that I was slightly effeminate?\u201d By the time he was in secondary school, he knew he was gay. He wanted to tell his mother that he was being bullied, but couldn\u2019t. He was terrified he would go door-knocking with his parents, and one of the bullies would open the door and hurl homophobic abuse at him. \u201cMy mam and dad had no idea I was going through all of that. But when I was in a situation where this could be exposed to them, it terrified me.\u201d Terror is a word he returns to time and again. Does he think the door-knocking helped bring out the actor in him? \u201cNo, it didn\u2019t give me anything other than terror. I simply hated it.\u201d He pauses. There was something that did help him discover his talent for performance, he says. Twice a week, on Thursday and Sunday, he would have to attend his local Kingdom Hall with his parents. Every so often, he\u2019d be assigned to read a passage from the Bible and explain its significance. \u201cAfter the talk, the elders would give advice on how to improve it. They\u2019d say, \u2018Use more illustrations\u2019 or \u2018Pause for emphasis\u2019 or \u2018Use repetition\u2019.\u201d In the early days, he loved that aspect of being a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, just as he loved dressing up in a suit and the sense of belonging. But none of that compensated for the downsides. It seems strange that you dedicated yourself to Jehovah with your baptism at 13 when you were sure you were gay, I say. He nods, but explains that he regarded it as his final chance of salvation. \u201cI thought maybe by doing that, the rest would disappear. I was so confused, and I had no one to talk to. The only thing I could talk about to people I knew was the religion. It consumed our conversation. I thought, well, focus on something else and hope the other thing goes away.\u201d Was it as conscious as that? \u201cYes, this could take me away from my thoughts; the bad things. Every night in the congregation they read scriptures saying terrible things about the way I was feeling and who I was possibly turning into. All that was in my head was: if I don\u2019t sort this out, I\u2019m going to lose my mum and dad. I\u2019m going to lose everything I\u2019ve ever known and I\u2019m also going to die at Armageddon, so I\u2019m giving myself a death sentence unless I sort his out.\u201d And you believed the death sentence? \u201cYep, 100%.\u201d What was more frightening \u2013 the thought of being disowned by your parents or Armageddon? Oh, Evans says instantly, losing his parents. \u201cThe only thing that mattered to me was my mam and dad. I didn\u2019t really care about the dying bit once I realised who I was and what I needed to do to be who I was. To be happy, there was only one route I could take, and my only worry was that I\u2019d lose Mam and Dad in the small period I had before Armageddon came. I had to make this decision: either you keep lying and live this life that is making you very unhappy or you take the risk and hope they don\u2019t cut you off and pretend that you are dead.\u201d The religion seems so unforgiving, I say. \u201cIt is,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s inhumane.\u201d At one point, his father discovered gay porn and literature in Evans\u2019 bedroom. Without mentioning it to his son, he burned it. When Evans asked his mother about where his stash had gone, she told him, but said that she didn\u2019t want to know about his sexuality; the implications were too terrible. At 16, Evans left school and town for Cardiff and a new life. He decided that was the only way he could hold on to his parents while being true to himself. He got an admin job in a finance company and began a relationship with his line manager, Tom, 20 years his senior. An anonymous letter was sent to personnel exposing the relationship, and Tom was fired. The couple could see no future for themselves. Evans describes his life as a series of \u201csliding doors\u201d moments, and this is when the biggest door opened. Tom was friendly with an exceptionally wealthy couple who invited them to stay. That night, they discussed Tom\u2019s dismissal from work. Evans, still a shy teenager, revealed that he liked to sing. After some cajoling, he agreed to perform Danny Boy for them. The next morning, the friends said they had a proposition \u2013 they would hire Tom to manage their trust fund and support Evans financially to put him through music and drama school. This is where Evans\u2019 story starts to verge on the implausible. At the age of 16, he was living in London with Tom in a luxury block of flats whose residents included Cilla Black. When he looked out of the window, he could see Andrew Lloyd Webber in his apartment opposite. Even today, Evans\u2019 eyes are on stalks when he describes the luxury he was living in. He throws back his head and rocks with laughter at the ludicrousness of it all. \u201cI know, right!\u201d he says. \u201cExactly!\u201d In his memoir, he refers to the Dracula-like teeth at the back of his mouth, and when he\u2019s laughing I can see them. Fangs apart, he\u2019s James Bond handsome, with a jawline sharp enough to chop wood. After he left for London, he told his parents that Tom was his landlord and rarely at home because he travelled for business. David and Yvonne accepted the story happily. Meanwhile, Evans studied at the London Studio Centre for a three-year diploma in musical theatre, where his tutors recognised him as a star in the making. He had a great time \u2013 partying, shagging, doing drugs. Not surprisingly, his relationship suffered. He and Tom began to feel their age difference, and split up. Evans suddenly found himself a typically impoverished, house-sharing student. The only difference was that when other students went home for the holidays, he felt he couldn\u2019t. He was now 19, broke and feeling bleak in a way he hadn\u2019t for three years. He hated lying to his parents, and was more frightened than ever of losing them. He confessed all to his mother, telling her that Tom had been his boyfriend, they had split up, and he was now living a lifestyle impossible to reconcile with being a Jehovah\u2019s Witness. Yvonne took it in her stride, but did not tell his father. She was as fearful of losing Luke as he was of losing her. Evans was in his early 20s and working in musical theatre when an interview he had done with gay publication the Advocate, in which he discussed his homosexuality, came to the attention of the Jehovah\u2019s Witness elders. They left a message on his phone saying if it was true that he was a \u201cpractising homosexual\u201d he would be disfellowshipped \u2013 kicked out of the church. The elders demanded he return to Aberbargoed for his punishment. Evans ignored the summons. Instead, he called Yvonne, who agreed it was now time to tell David. His father was devastated, reminded Evans he would die at Armageddon, and told him he was going for a walk. By the time he returned, David had realised he could not break off contact with his son. In absentia, Evans was disfellowshipped; his parents were there to witness his humiliation. I ask Evans how the elders would have worded it. \u201cThey would have said, \u2018Luke Evans is no longer a member of the Christian congregation.\u2019 The subtext is: \u2018You can no longer speak to him, have any relationship with him, he is an outcast, he is now not part of any of our lives.\u2019\u201d Was it a relief when he was disfellowshipped? \u201cYes, but it was painful, because I knew my mam and dad were sitting in that Kingdom Hall surrounded by people that knew them and knew me until I was 16. It must have been a horrible moment for them. I think they just went home, hugged each other and got through it. Ptffftssssch.\u201d He exhales loudly, slowly, as if he\u2019s been punctured. His parents proved heroic, he says. They didn\u2019t cast him out, nor did they give up on the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. Somehow they managed to stay true to both. And this is where his feelings about the religion become surprisingly nuanced. \u201cI should be very angry, but I don\u2019t feel it. Because while all this stuff that was happening to me was not pleasant, and I\u2019d never want anyone else to go through it, I see two people who have found a life that works for them. They have wonderful friends, inside and outside the religion.\u201d He stops. \u201cBut if it doesn\u2019t work for somebody, they should have the right to say so. \u2018I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019ve really, really tried, can I go? Is it OK?\u2019 And that\u2019s the bit you can\u2019t do once you get baptised.\u201d Evans went on to enjoy enough success in musical theatre (the romantic lead in a touring production of Miss Saigon, Taboo, Piaf and Rent Remixed in the West End) to help his parents out when his father got sick and could no longer work. He bought the house next door to his parents for them to rent out, providing them with an income. Every so often, the elders would knock on their door and tell David and Yvonne that they knew they were still in touch with Luke and that it was a sin. David comes across in the book as obedient to the point of meekness. But there came a time when he\u2019d had enough. Evans quotes David\u2019s heroic speech to the elders in his book: \u201cWhen I got sick, who put petrol in the car? Who paid for the electricity? Who paid for the food in the fridge? Was it you? No, it was our son.\u201d As I read the passage aloud to Evans, he wells up. It goes on: \u201cEven though you tried to keep us away from him, has Luke ever told us to leave the church? No. He\u2019s moved as far as he possibly can from us so he wouldn\u2019t bring reproach on the religion, and you\u2019re still trying to drag him back into this. Well, never again. Don\u2019t come to our house and tell us not to speak to our son, because if it wasn\u2019t for him we wouldn\u2019t even have this house.\u201d Evans weeps, his words coming out in choked spasms. \u201cYeah \u2026 yeah \u2026 it\u2019s an incredible thing.\u201d He smiles through his tears. \u201cGood on him!\u201d David lost his privileges in the church and was struck off from being a ministerial servant, one step below becoming an elder. And still, despite everything, David and Yvonne remain in the church today. I notice a tattoo circling his forearm. It looks like a thinly sketched trace of a heartbeat. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a D, Y and an L, for David, Yvonne and Luke \u2013 my dad, my mam and me,\u201d Evans says. \u201cIt\u2019s eternal. We\u2019ve been through everything together and I think we will be for ever linked.\u201d Another smile. \u201cIt\u2019s my first tattoo. I was 39. I thought, the only way I\u2019m going to get around this with my mam is to say that I did it with the letters of their names. And it worked a treat!\u201d At 45, he admits he is still a mummy\u2019s boy. \u201cWhen my mam doesn\u2019t like something, I still feel it. I want to please them.\u201d At 30, Evans had another crisis. His career in musical theatre felt precarious. He could go for months without a job, and it wasn\u2019t getting any more secure for him. \u201cI thought, am I still going to be renting a room in a shared flat in 20 years\u2019 time?\u201d He considered giving up theatre for a dull but stable job \u2013 something in the service industry, perhaps. Musical theatre was demanding, and yet it was patronised by so many in the industry \u2013 he was seen as a mere hoofer, not a real actor. He had tried to break into straight theatre to no avail. When he asked his agent to put him up for a part in Peter Gill\u2019s Small Change, about two Welsh boys, the agent told him he was reaching beyond himself. So Evans wrote to the casting director himself \u2013 and ended up getting the job. Another sliding door moment. From there, he got himself a new British agent, then an American one, and within weeks, he was offered the part of Apollo in the remake of Clash of the Titans. It was bonkers, he says. Little Luke Evans who couldn\u2019t get regular work in the West End was then cast in film after film. Five of them in his first year. The more movies he made, the more he found himself in demand and the bigger the paycheque. Hollywood decided he was a natural action man. His sexuality was never questioned. \u201cI played straight rugged masculine men. I am queer, but I present in a masculine way. And thank God, in a way, because bloody hell, I wouldn\u2019t have had the career I\u2019ve had if I presented any other way.\u201d Has he seen any of the school bullies since he\u2019s been making a living playing macho men? \u201cHahaha! It is quite brilliant, isn\u2019t it? It does make me giggle. No, I haven\u2019t.\u201d He made his breakthrough in the era of the Twilight films, when the vogue was for men in touch with their feminine side. \u201cThere were a lot of pretty, young, muscle-bound twinks with no stubble and beautiful big doe eyes that could turn into wolves. But there weren\u2019t a lot of me \u2013 Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton. There was a very small pot of these late-20s, early-30s masculine-presenting men, and I fitted into that category without even trying.\u201d One day, he walked along the red carpet at a premiere with a female friend. The Daily Mail decided she was his girlfriend and reported it in a gossip column. His management team advised him to say nothing, and he went along with it. But he felt uncomfortable. Although he\u2019d never suggested he was straight, he felt complicit in his silence. Now he began to worry he would be exposed as gay, despite the fact that he had outed himself 20 years earlier and everybody in his life knew he was gay. Sure enough, the rumours began on social media. Trolls suggested Evans was living a lie. They dug up the 2002 interview in the Advocate where he\u2019d talked about refusing to be closeted. Yet as an emerging movie star, he had become coy about his sexuality, for example telling Cosmopolitan in 2010 that he hoped to adopt three dogs and \u201cshare them with someone else\u201d. Having lived with homophobic abuse for so much of his life, it was now people in the gay community who began to taunt him. It lasted for three years, and almost broke Evans. \u201cIt brought back an immense amount of PTSD that was connected to what I felt like when I was a kid, thinking I was going to lose my mam and dad.\u201d The thing is, he says, nobody had asked him directly. And if they had, he would have told them. The comments were hideous, including \u201cI hope he dies of Aids\u201d. When he talks about it, you can hear the exasperation in his voice. \u201cThe first thing is they don\u2019t know who they\u2019re talking about. They don\u2019t know me. I didn\u2019t just live as a gay man, I sacrificed all of my childhood friends. I had to move out at 16. I had to navigate London, drugs, sex, with no one to fall back on apart from the new people I\u2019d found in my life. There was never a point where I was ashamed. I had a plan from the age of 12 to escape because I wanted to be the person I am.\u201d He reddens in anger. \u201cThere was a lot of hate. I was being treated as if I\u2019d turned my back on my identity and the community I was a strong part of.\u201d How did he get through it? \u201cBy throwing myself into work and keeping my real friends close to me. Whenever I wasn\u2019t on a film set I was with my friends in London living the most normal of lives. My team was really supportive and I was ready for the conversation when it came up.\u201d When promoting the film Dracula Untold in 2014, he was asked by Women\u2019s Wear Daily if he was setting a new precedent as an openly gay action star. Evans replied: \u201cIt\u2019s good for people to look at me and think, this guy is doing his thing and enjoying what he\u2019s doing and successful at it and living his life.\u201d He waited for the fallout. \u201cI thought it could shatter my casting credibility. But that was all in my head because the jobs kept coming.\u201d Then the coin flipped again, he says, back to old-school homophobia. \u201cI was getting the roles over my straight counterparts. Some were very pissed off.\u201d Evans has overcome amazing odds to get to where he is today. It\u2019s inspiring, and yet at the same time there is something profoundly depressing that he is still an outlier; that Hollywood has made such little progress since the days when James Dean and Rock Hudson were forced to hide their sexuality to protect their careers. \u201cAnd Montgomery Clift,\u201d he adds with a smile. The redness has long subsided. \u201cI thought over a decade ago, you won\u2019t be on your own for long. Of course there are lots of gay actors, but playing the roles I\u2019m playing I don\u2019t think there\u2019s many.\u201d He tells me about the part he\u2019s filming in Portland for a TV series called Criminal, adapted from an Ed Brubaker comic. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m playing the hardest, darkest, most sinister straight man.\u201d How hard is he in real life? \u201cI can stand up for myself, which is something I couldn\u2019t do when I was a kid. Not that I really need to these days.\u201d Has playing hard-man roles toughened him up? \u201cThey\u2019ve definitely given me confidence. Maybe superficial confidence, but they have made me feel stronger in my shoes.\u201d In his memoir, he says that Ian McKellen was one of the first to recognise the glass ceiling Evans had broken through. The great actor and gay activist told him: \u201cOoh look at you, you\u2019re going to be a big butch star!\u201d It meant a lot to McKellen? \u201cIt did. He was very aware of the ground I was treading. I just hoped it would have moved further than it has.\u201d Can he think of any other out gay actors who would be cast in the part he\u2019s currently filming? He thinks about it. \u201cNo,\u201d he finally says. He makes it clear this is a regret, not a boast. Since coming out for the second time, Evans has rarely talked about his private life. In Boy from the Valleys, he lays it all before us \u2013 from his primary school crush on a rugby-playing teacher to his relationships with older men, dating the model and actor Jon Kortajarena, and the three years he\u2019s been with his current partner, Spanish architect Fran Tomas, with whom he has started a fashion and lifestyle business. He and Tomas share homes in London, Lisbon and Ibiza. Some days, he says, they think about having kids together; other times, they think they\u2019ll stick with their godchildren (Evans has five). He says he couldn\u2019t be more content. He has even managed to combine his movie career with singing \u2013 he\u2019s released two albums of cover songs, the last of which reached No 4 in the UK charts. As for the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, he believes they have taught him plenty. \u201cHaving doors slammed in my face from as early as I can remember put me in good stead for when I became an actor and didn\u2019t get a job. I didn\u2019t give a damn. I\u2019d be like, OK, all right, moving on. There\u2019s another 10 doors. I\u2019ll just keep knocking on them.\u201d As an actor, he\u2019s also extending his range \u2013 playing against type, as it were. Last year, he was hugely moving in the film Our Son, about two gay men whose relationship is breaking up and the impact it has on their child. He still insists that a person\u2019s sexuality should be an irrelevance. But, of course, he knows the reality is different. I ask what his life would be like now if he had stayed a Jehovah\u2019s Witness? \u201cI would have lived a very sad, isolated life, because I would have had to renounce my sexuality.\u201d Ultimately, Evans believes that walking away from his religion was a life or death decision for him. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I\u2019d be here today if that had been the life I\u2019d chosen to live,\u201d he says. \u2022 Boy from the Valleys: My Unexpected Journey, by Luke Evans, published on 7 November by Ebury Spotlight at \u00a322.

      "body": "<p>From the rooftop of the castle where I\u2019m standing, a panorama of blue-grey turrets stretches into the distance. The effect is like staring into a kaleidoscope. It\u2019s a fairytale sight, the intricate white-painted fronts and curved balconies resembling a collection of adult-sized doll\u2019s houses.</p> \n<p>The fantasy quickly falls apart, though. Many of the castles further into the complex have only bare concrete facades. In between them,<strong> </strong>spaces intended for manicured lawns have been reclaimed by wildflowers, some so tall that their petals and fronds stretch up to the first-floor balconies. An eerie silence is broken only by birdsong and the occasional passing car.</p> \n<p>It is a warm summer day in August 2023 and there is no one here except a bored security guard and Adem Tekg\u00f6z, our tour guide to this bizarre ghost town in the Turkish countryside. Tekg\u00f6z represents the Sarot Group, the developer of this crumbling fantasy land, and his surly demeanour suggests he is not keen to show off their work to new visitors. \u201cIt gets cold in the winter, so we stopped construction. We\u2019re preparing to restart next summer,\u201d he says, brushing aside the question of why no work is taking place now. No matter: Tekg\u00f6z appears confident that a lick of paint and reconnecting the electricity to the wires strung between the castles will breathe life back into the project.</p> \n<p>As we inspect the interiors, where wires dangle from bare ceilings, it\u2019s clear that some of the rooms have water damage, presumably from the snow that blankets the surrounding valley each winter. Tekg\u00f6z\u2019s tour also means stumbling across frequent evidence of neglect, including a bloodied bird carcass and what I hope are animal droppings near a concrete cavity in the basement of one castle. In the deserted centre of the complex, one floor of what is supposed to be a shopping mall and luxury hotel is littered with evidence of how much work is still to do: piles of abandoned filigree mouldings and unused turrets lie on the concrete.</p> \n<p>When drone footage of the complex of 732 castles appeared online a few years ago, they quickly became a viral phenomenon: there are dozens of YouTube videos marvelling at the cluster of Disney-like chateaux. Since then, the mystery of whether they will ever be finished has only deepened.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"56a45c62-8669-4aca-bcf0-272a680c471d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RsUOXI_DWfM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The castles were supposed to bring a welcome injection of Gulf money to this part of Turkey. On paper, it was a tempting pitch for prospective purchasers from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain: a luxury development named Burj Al Babas (a nonsensical mashup of Arabic and Turkish, playing on the name of local hot springs). Each castle, when completed, was meant to have its own pipeline to the healing spring waters, feeding private indoor swimming pools. Then there was the location: a lush spot away from the intense 45C heat of Gulf summers, conveniently located between Istanbul and the capital Ankara, and only a short distance from Mudurnu\u2019s peaceful town square and quiet streets of squat, Ottoman-era wooden houses.</p> \n<p>Instead, since construction abruptly stopped in 2016, the project has become a bizarre white elephant. As the scandal has dragged on, it has sparked multiple lawsuits, one attempted suicide, a bitter vendetta between one contractor and the Sarot Group, and even a minor diplomatic incident between Turkey and Kuwait. The castles have become a freakish local tourist attraction, luring influencers to break into the site and film inside. Music videos have been shot there, including one for an Italian dance act featuring a motorbike and plentiful use of fire and red smoke flares.</p> \n<p>The deserted castles have come to symbolise the financial problems and mismanagement that have<strong> </strong>dominated Turkey\u2019s construction sector during president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s two decades in power. Companies with links to the government have cut corners with impunity \u2013 a state of affairs illustrated most dramatically by 2023\u2019s twin earthquakes,<strong> </strong>in<strong> </strong>which cities were damaged across an area the size of Germany. The castles have also led to a major rift among the villagers in Mudurnu, between those who see the whole development as an eyesore and those who still hold out hope that the project might be good for local businesses. The only thing the hundreds of angry castle owners, local residents and the Sarot Group can agree on is that the castles aren\u2019t going anywhere \u2013 but whether they will ever be completed remains unknown.</p> \n<p>* * *</p> \n<p>\u2018It\u2019s a rich drama,\u201d says Jassim Alfahhad, 55, a Kuwaiti air force colonel turned management consultant and academic, who heads a group of almost 150 disgruntled clients in Kuwait City, each of whom paid $150,000-$450,000 (\u00a3115,000-\u00a3345,000) for their identical castles. \u201cThe property owners have suffered for almost a decade.\u201d</p> \n<p>When we speak by phone, Alfahhad tells me he maintains two homes for his two families and sets of grandchildren (polygamy is legal in Kuwait). One he says was built to resemble a Victorian house, and the other in a more traditional Islamic architectural style. \u201cIt really looks like a castle, but a traditional Moroccan one,\u201d he says. \u201cI like historical architecture.\u201d</p> \n<p>Alfahhad had contemplated buying property in Turkey before, but the idea of a holiday home in a castle, or at least something resembling one, was just too good to ignore. After hearing about the project from a friend in the spring of 2015, he took the Sarot Group up on its offer of a free tour, and found himself enchanted. Where others dismissed them as kitsch, Alfahhad saw in the pointed turrets references to Istanbul\u2019s Galata Tower and the Maiden\u2019s Tower, both of which date back centuries. He remembers studying for a master\u2019s and then a doctorate in Britain, where his weekends were spent touring stately homes and castles across Scotland and Wales. Even though the chateaux were close together, he felt they were perfect for someone like him who longed for the isolation of the temperate Turkish countryside. </p> \n<p>Back in Kuwait, he visited the Sarot Group\u2019s sales office and met co-director B\u00fclent Y\u0131lmaz, who helped Alfahhad pick the idea spot on the hillside, one he said would be away from the bustle of the shopping mall and supermarket. His castle cost $290,000. Alfahhad paid the first of several instalments, and began the wait.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s how the tragedy starts,\u201d he says. \u201cThe contract stated that by 31 December 2018 the project would be finished and we would be able to receive our villas. Of course, that did not happen.\u201d The contract also stated that any delay to the castles\u2019 delivery date would incur a fine of $2,000 a month, payable to each buyer.</p> \n<p>* * *</p> \n<p>Mudurnu is an unlikely location for bold feats of architecture. The townspeople are proud of the 130-year-old wooden clock tower, built in the same style as the Ottoman-era buildings that housed traders travelling the Silk Road. With its population of 5,500, Mudurnu is the kind of place where residents know their neighbours intimately. Locals here have taken to referring to Burj Al Babas as \u201cthe Dracula castles\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a town where people don\u2019t lock their doors. We trust one another,\u201d says Mehmet Cant\u00fcrk, sitting under an awning in the garden of his 200-year-old wooden home. Cant\u00fcrk is a softly spoken, white-haired environmentalist who can name every species of plant in his garden and the surrounding area. Mudurnu, he explains, is a place that\u2019s all about respect for \u201ctraditional values, and that means opposing consumerism\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf I had the power, I would completely destroy the whole thing,\u201d he says of the development. \u201cI would simply grant nature the power to reclaim the entire area.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cant\u00fcrk first heard about the project in 2011, when he sat on the local council. Among his concerns are the way the construction clashes with local traditional architecture, the abundant use of concrete, and assorted prejudices about an influx of Gulf visitors not understanding Mudurnu. Then there is his objection to the privatisation of the Babas hot springs underneath the site to feed the castles\u2019 swimming pools. The Sarot Group acquired the right to extract the spring water from the land, a resource Cant\u00fcrk says should be public.</p> \n<p>He believes that plenty of others share his views, even if they have been less willing to complain to the local authorities. For the residents of Mudurnu, the project steamrolled from a slideshow to a construction site with an eerie sense of inevitability. He adds ruefully: \u201cWhen there\u2019s one person who objects, it doesn\u2019t have a lot of impact on the municipality.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mudurnu, like much of Turkey, is trying to weather high unemployment and an economic crisis that in recent years has seen Erdo\u011fan turn to the Gulf, notably the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, for a bailout. The country is dotted with a string of failed efforts to attract Gulf money, including an abandoned dinosaur park in Ankara that cost $801m, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/desolate-turkish-amusement-park-touted-testament-government-waste-2022-07-26/\">according to the capital\u2019s mayor</a>, who has criticised his predecessor for greenlighting it. None of this dissuaded former Mudurnu mayor Mehmet \u0130neg\u00f6l from granting the Sarot Group planning permission for 80 castles in 2011. Four years later, an adjacent plot of land was rezoned to become part of Mudurnu, and \u0130neg\u00f6l gave Sarot permission to build the rest of the<strong> </strong>732 castles, with half intended for wealthy Gulf buyers and the remainder marketed as timeshares for domestic tourists. He says his motivation was the promise of jobs \u2013 but some also point to \u0130neg\u00f6l\u2019s relationship with Mehmet Yerdelen and the Sarot Group.</p> \n<p>Since then, the Sarot Group\u2019s timeshare empire has spread across the verdant hills outside Mudurnu. There\u2019s the Sarot Thermal Park up a winding path on a hillside, which boasts spa facilities, healing pools and treatment rooms. Next door is the Sarot Thermal Palace with its golden rooftop, a cavernous atrium, timeshare hotel rooms and rows of pink plastic cherry blossom trees near swimming pools that when we visit are bustling with visiting families. The hotel\u2019s pillars and mouldings appear to be carved from crimson marble, but a light touch reveals some far cheaper material and a hollow interior. Adjoining this is a cluster of squat timeshare apartments, the Sarot Thermal Valley Holiday Village.</p> \n<p>One shop owner from Mudurnu cautiously describes how she bought a timeshare there, but was burnt when she bought a second in a nearby valley that was never delivered. This was the Sarot Village \u2013 a group of buildings shaped like giant grey birdhouses, all made entirely from concrete, including the roofing.

According to local media, one of them climbed to the top of a tower that housed the Sarot Group\u2019s on-site concrete manufacturing facility, threatening to jump to his death if he wasn\u2019t paid.

When the local police got involved, along with the town prosecutor, Demircan abandoned his vendetta and left town. He hasn\u2019t returned to Mudurnu since, and has dropped his lawsuit alleging environmental damage and other complaints against the company.</p> \n<p>* * *</p> \n<p>By late 2016, it had started to become clear to Alfahhad, the Kuwaiti buyer, that construction work on the castles wasn\u2019t happening on schedule. The Sarot Group initially blamed the cold winter weather, then the after-effects of a failed military coup, which shook Turkey that July. Cant\u00fcrk and others in Mudurnu began to notice contractors were no longer showing up at the site, and suspected complaints about pay were to blame.</p> \n<p>As the months wore on, the Kuwaiti buyers began discussing other options. Some attempted to sue the Sarot Group, but the cases stalled. Alfahhad claims some members even attempted to<strong> </strong>introduce Yerdelen\u2019s co-director B\u00fclent Y\u0131lmaz to wealthy Kuwaiti investors who offered to take over the project, but that Y\u0131lmaz shrugged them off. Y\u0131lmaz declined to answer questions, claiming he left the Sarot Group in 2017, although records show he remained on its board until last year.</p> \n<p>The Sarot Group entered bankruptcy proceedings in 2018, with Yerdelen blaming the buyers for not making payments on time. Alfahhad shows me a document from the Sarot Group to prove that he has paid in full, and says Yerdelen\u2019s comments only irked them more. Sure enough, an Istanbul bankruptcy court ruled that the Sarot Group was comfortably in credit in late 2022.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We remain optimistic that this will end soon, but some of the buyers lost loved ones \u2013 they died before this project was finished</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>By this time Alfahhad and his group were despairing of the Turkish judicial system, believing that only diplomatic intervention could save their castles. He began using his connections as a former Kuwaiti prime ministerial adviser, calling the Kuwaiti foreign ministry and setting up a meeting with the Turkish ambassador to Kuwait. He also flew to Ankara several times to meet the Kuwaiti ambassador there, reassured by his pledge to treat the castles \u201clike an emergency\u201d and raise the issue at the highest echelons of the Turkish state.</p> \n<p>The issue appeared deadlocked until May this year, when the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, made a state visit to Ankara. Arriving in sunglasses and sweeping gold-fringed robes to a full military welcome, the emir met Erdo\u011fan, and the two leaders <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGSf96J2ZAk\">were pictured</a> walking down a pale blue carpet to the presidential palace, their hands clasped. It was a welcome development for Alfahhad and the other buyers, who understood that the emir and Erdo\u011fan found time to discuss the hundreds of unfinished concrete castles. The Turkish presidency has declined to comment.</p> \n<p>Whatever took place behind the ornate doors of the presidential palace, the emir\u2019s visit does seem to have turned things around for Burj Al Babas. Or, in the words of lawyer Selim Sar\u0131ibrahimo\u011flu, who has advised the castle owners, it has \u201cpumped some warm blood into this issue\u201d. Now an Istanbul court that examines financial and organised crimes has taken up the case, and is combing through the Sarot Group\u2019s finances,<strong> </strong>as prosecutors accuse them of defrauding investors and using Burj Al Babas as a front company for suspicious transactions; Yerdelen says there is no truth to allegations of money laundering. All 14 of the companies run by Yerdelen and the Sarot Group, including those overseeing construction of the castles, have been entrusted to a Turkish state fund partially controlled by Erdo\u011fan\u2019s office and intended to rectify the finances of troubled businesses.</p> \n<p>Sar\u0131ibrahimo\u011flu points to a puzzle that has hung over the project for years: Yerdelen and the Sarot Group had millions of dollars in sales, more than enough to finish building the castles. Surely it would have been easier just to finish the project rather than endure these years of trouble? \u201cIt really is an odd thing,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they put themselves in this situation. But these things can always be solved at a political level. We are happy now that everything is under the control of the Turkish state.\u201d</p> \n<p>Others \u2013 like political consultant Selim Sazak \u2013 contend that the trickle-down corruption of the Turkish state under Erdo\u011fan is what allowed the castles to be built in the first place. </p> \n<p>\u201cThese people were powerful enough, socially and maybe politically, to get the construction permits they got and to market them to the Gulf,\u201d he says of the Sarot Group. The castles, he adds, are \u201ca monstrosity\u201d, a project that shows how even those with political connections far from the presidential palace \u201ccan end up doing something this brazen\u201d.</p> \n<p>As the court proceedings drag on, the castles remain untouched. The weeds and wildflowers have grown taller, but the project remains frozen in time. Yerdelen says he believes \u201cwith all my heart\u201d that his company will one day not only finish building the castles, but throw a grand opening party to celebrate. He dismisses state control of his companies as something \u201ctemporary\u201d, adding: \u201cWe plan to continue construction where we left off.\u201d</p> \n<p>Alfahhad also believes that he and the other buyers will eventually get their castles on the hillside, but not from the Sarot Group. Then there\u2019s the small matter of the late fees that the Sarot Group owe each buyer, which he says they intend to claim. The company currently owes him almost $150,000, half of what he paid for his castle; Yerdelen says buyers should direct their demands about fees to the Turkish state fund.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe remain optimistic that this will end soon \u2013 but of course it won\u2019t be like receiving one five or six years ago,\u201d says Alfahhad. \u201cSome of the other buyers lost loved ones \u2013 they died before this project was finished. They just wanted to go and sit in their castles.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "From the rooftop of the castle where I\u2019m standing, a panorama of blue-grey turrets stretches into the distance. The effect is like staring into a kaleidoscope. It\u2019s a fairytale sight, the intricate white-painted fronts and curved balconies resembling a collection of adult-sized doll\u2019s houses. The fantasy quickly falls apart, though. Many of the castles further into the complex have only bare concrete facades. In between them, spaces intended for manicured lawns have been reclaimed by wildflowers, some so tall that their petals and fronds stretch up to the first-floor balconies. An eerie silence is broken only by birdsong and the occasional passing car. It is a warm summer day in August 2023 and there is no one here except a bored security guard and Adem Tekg\u00f6z, our tour guide to this bizarre ghost town in the Turkish countryside. Tekg\u00f6z represents the Sarot Group, the developer of this crumbling fantasy land, and his surly demeanour suggests he is not keen to show off their work to new visitors. \u201cIt gets cold in the winter, so we stopped construction. We\u2019re preparing to restart next summer,\u201d he says, brushing aside the question of why no work is taking place now. No matter: Tekg\u00f6z appears confident that a lick of paint and reconnecting the electricity to the wires strung between the castles will breathe life back into the project. As we inspect the interiors, where wires dangle from bare ceilings, it\u2019s clear that some of the rooms have water damage, presumably from the snow that blankets the surrounding valley each winter. Tekg\u00f6z\u2019s tour also means stumbling across frequent evidence of neglect, including a bloodied bird carcass and what I hope are animal droppings near a concrete cavity in the basement of one castle. In the deserted centre of the complex, one floor of what is supposed to be a shopping mall and luxury hotel is littered with evidence of how much work is still to do: piles of abandoned filigree mouldings and unused turrets lie on the concrete. When drone footage of the complex of 732 castles appeared online a few years ago, they quickly became a viral phenomenon: there are dozens of YouTube videos marvelling at the cluster of Disney-like chateaux. Since then, the mystery of whether they will ever be finished has only deepened. The castles were supposed to bring a welcome injection of Gulf money to this part of Turkey. On paper, it was a tempting pitch for prospective purchasers from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain: a luxury development named Burj Al Babas (a nonsensical mashup of Arabic and Turkish, playing on the name of local hot springs). Each castle, when completed, was meant to have its own pipeline to the healing spring waters, feeding private indoor swimming pools. Then there was the location: a lush spot away from the intense 45C heat of Gulf summers, conveniently located between Istanbul and the capital Ankara, and only a short distance from Mudurnu\u2019s peaceful town square and quiet streets of squat, Ottoman-era wooden houses. Instead, since construction abruptly stopped in 2016, the project has become a bizarre white elephant. As the scandal has dragged on, it has sparked multiple lawsuits, one attempted suicide, a bitter vendetta between one contractor and the Sarot Group, and even a minor diplomatic incident between Turkey and Kuwait. The castles have become a freakish local tourist attraction, luring influencers to break into the site and film inside. Music videos have been shot there, including one for an Italian dance act featuring a motorbike and plentiful use of fire and red smoke flares. The deserted castles have come to symbolise the financial problems and mismanagement that have dominated Turkey\u2019s construction sector during president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s two decades in power. Companies with links to the government have cut corners with impunity \u2013 a state of affairs illustrated most dramatically by 2023\u2019s twin earthquakes, in which cities were damaged across an area the size of Germany. The castles have also led to a major rift among the villagers in Mudurnu, between those who see the whole development as an eyesore and those who still hold out hope that the project might be good for local businesses. The only thing the hundreds of angry castle owners, local residents and the Sarot Group can agree on is that the castles aren\u2019t going anywhere \u2013 but whether they will ever be completed remains unknown. * * * \u2018It\u2019s a rich drama,\u201d says Jassim Alfahhad, 55, a Kuwaiti air force colonel turned management consultant and academic, who heads a group of almost 150 disgruntled clients in Kuwait City, each of whom paid $150,000-$450,000 (\u00a3115,000-\u00a3345,000) for their identical castles. \u201cThe property owners have suffered for almost a decade.\u201d When we speak by phone, Alfahhad tells me he maintains two homes for his two families and sets of grandchildren (polygamy is legal in Kuwait). One he says was built to resemble a Victorian house, and the other in a more traditional Islamic architectural style. \u201cIt really looks like a castle, but a traditional Moroccan one,\u201d he says. \u201cI like historical architecture.\u201d Alfahhad had contemplated buying property in Turkey before, but the idea of a holiday home in a castle, or at least something resembling one, was just too good to ignore. After hearing about the project from a friend in the spring of 2015, he took the Sarot Group up on its offer of a free tour, and found himself enchanted. Where others dismissed them as kitsch, Alfahhad saw in the pointed turrets references to Istanbul\u2019s Galata Tower and the Maiden\u2019s Tower, both of which date back centuries. He remembers studying for a master\u2019s and then a doctorate in Britain, where his weekends were spent touring stately homes and castles across Scotland and Wales. Even though the chateaux were close together, he felt they were perfect for someone like him who longed for the isolation of the temperate Turkish countryside. Back in Kuwait, he visited the Sarot Group\u2019s sales office and met co-director B\u00fclent Y\u0131lmaz, who helped Alfahhad pick the idea spot on the hillside, one he said would be away from the bustle of the shopping mall and supermarket. His castle cost $290,000. Alfahhad paid the first of several instalments, and began the wait. \u201cThat\u2019s how the tragedy starts,\u201d he says. \u201cThe contract stated that by 31 December 2018 the project would be finished and we would be able to receive our villas. Of course, that did not happen.\u201d The contract also stated that any delay to the castles\u2019 delivery date would incur a fine of $2,000 a month, payable to each buyer. * * * Mudurnu is an unlikely location for bold feats of architecture. The townspeople are proud of the 130-year-old wooden clock tower, built in the same style as the Ottoman-era buildings that housed traders travelling the Silk Road. With its population of 5,500, Mudurnu is the kind of place where residents know their neighbours intimately. Locals here have taken to referring to Burj Al Babas as \u201cthe Dracula castles\u201d. \u201cThis is a town where people don\u2019t lock their doors. We trust one another,\u201d says Mehmet Cant\u00fcrk, sitting under an awning in the garden of his 200-year-old wooden home. Cant\u00fcrk is a softly spoken, white-haired environmentalist who can name every species of plant in his garden and the surrounding area. Mudurnu, he explains, is a place that\u2019s all about respect for \u201ctraditional values, and that means opposing consumerism\u201d. \u201cIf I had the power, I would completely destroy the whole thing,\u201d he says of the development. \u201cI would simply grant nature the power to reclaim the entire area.\u201d Cant\u00fcrk first heard about the project in 2011, when he sat on the local council. Among his concerns are the way the construction clashes with local traditional architecture, the abundant use of concrete, and assorted prejudices about an influx of Gulf visitors not understanding Mudurnu. Then there is his objection to the privatisation of the Babas hot springs underneath the site to feed the castles\u2019 swimming pools. The Sarot Group acquired the right to extract the spring water from the land, a resource Cant\u00fcrk says should be public. He believes that plenty of others share his views, even if they have been less willing to complain to the local authorities. For the residents of Mudurnu, the project steamrolled from a slideshow to a construction site with an eerie sense of inevitability. He adds ruefully: \u201cWhen there\u2019s one person who objects, it doesn\u2019t have a lot of impact on the municipality.\u201d Mudurnu, like much of Turkey, is trying to weather high unemployment and an economic crisis that in recent years has seen Erdo\u011fan turn to the Gulf, notably the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, for a bailout. The country is dotted with a string of failed efforts to attract Gulf money, including an abandoned dinosaur park in Ankara that cost $801m, according to the capital\u2019s mayor, who has criticised his predecessor for greenlighting it. None of this dissuaded former Mudurnu mayor Mehmet \u0130neg\u00f6l from granting the Sarot Group planning permission for 80 castles in 2011. Four years later, an adjacent plot of land was rezoned to become part of Mudurnu, and \u0130neg\u00f6l gave Sarot permission to build the rest of the 732 castles, with half intended for wealthy Gulf buyers and the remainder marketed as timeshares for domestic tourists. He says his motivation was the promise of jobs \u2013 but some also point to \u0130neg\u00f6l\u2019s relationship with Mehmet Yerdelen and the Sarot Group. Since then, the Sarot Group\u2019s timeshare empire has spread across the verdant hills outside Mudurnu. There\u2019s the Sarot Thermal Park up a winding path on a hillside, which boasts spa facilities, healing pools and treatment rooms. Next door is the Sarot Thermal Palace with its golden rooftop, a cavernous atrium, timeshare hotel rooms and rows of pink plastic cherry blossom trees near swimming pools that when we visit are bustling with visiting families. The hotel\u2019s pillars and mouldings appear to be carved from crimson marble, but a light touch reveals some far cheaper material and a hollow interior. Adjoining this is a cluster of squat timeshare apartments, the Sarot Thermal Valley Holiday Village. One shop owner from Mudurnu cautiously describes how she bought a timeshare there, but was burnt when she bought a second in a nearby valley that was never delivered. This was the Sarot Village \u2013 a group of buildings shaped like giant grey birdhouses, all made entirely from concrete, including the roofing. The unconventional design choice is explained by the Sarot Group\u2019s in-house concrete company, which seemingly churned out every part of the strange buildings around the same time as the castles. Now, their deserted rows are lined with tall grass, making this an ideal setting for a horror film. The shop owner refuses to give her name, saying she was too scared to take legal action at the time, and even now fears reprisals from the Sarot Group or those connected to them. \u201cI feel we were scammed,\u201d she says. The Yerdelen family, who primarily control the company, also have deep ties to the Saadet party, a conservative Islamist group that splintered from the same parent organisation as Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Justice and Development party (AKP). At least two members, including Mehmet Yerdelen, have held local office for the party in Istanbul. The wedding of Yerdelen\u2019s son Enes was attended by an array of stars from Turkey\u2019s conservative Islamist movement, and included a fiery speech from the son of the late prime minister Necmettin Erbakan, godfather of Turkish Islamist politics, and Erdo\u011fan\u2019s mentor. Yerdelen insists that the Sarot Group does not \u201chave a political identity\u201d and that purchasers\u2019 fears about reprisals are unfounded. He maintains that approval for the Mudurnu project was granted at a level above \u0130neg\u00f6l, downplaying the former mayor\u2019s role in approving the project. He also says his friendship with \u0130neg\u00f6l pre-dates any thoughts of the castles, describing him as \u201ca friend whose only purpose is to serve the people of Mudurnu\u201d. \u0130neg\u00f6l lost his position as mayor in 2019. He says the Sarot Group has done nothing illegal, and defends what he calls his \u201cacquaintance\u201d with Yerdelen. \u201cPoliticians and investors are always close,\u201d he says. Even now, the former mayor describes the castles as an economic boon to the town just waiting to happen. \u201cUnhappy people could never properly understand the development,\u201d he says. He claims its detractors will someday be the \u201cfirst to bring their children to be employed\u201d there. Yerdelen blames Turkey\u2019s economic crisis for the delay in construction, along with buyers failing to make payments \u2013 a claim contradicted by Alfahhad and his group in Kuwait. He insists the Sarot Group will someday resume building. Mudurnu\u2019s newly elected mayor, Do\u011fan Onurlu, says: \u201cIt\u2019s a private company, so we\u2019re not responsible. It would be good to finish the construction. That\u2019s all we\u2019re going to say,\u201d before hanging up the phone. * * * Construction of the castles ran into problems not long after the Sarot Group broke ground in Burj Al Babas. On arriving at the site in 2014, contractor \u00c7apan Demircan turned whistleblower and filed a complaint with local prosecutors, claiming the construction company was breaching environmental laws by dumping rubble on the pines that cover the hillside. When we meet in the bright conference room at the offices of a local paper near Demircan\u2019s home in Istanbul, he is bursting to talk about what has become a years-long obsession. Demircan has complained persistently to the authorities about the castle project, badgering any official he could find in Mudurnu or the surrounding Bolu provincial government. To hear him tell it, no one was willing to listen. \u201cI was seen as a troublemaker just creating problems out of nothing,\u201d he says. In February 2015, a group of workers began to protest over unpaid wages at the construction site. According to local media, one of them climbed to the top of a tower that housed the Sarot Group\u2019s on-site concrete manufacturing facility, threatening to jump to his death if he wasn\u2019t paid. A photo that ran in many Mudurnu papers shows him gripping the railing on the roof of the building. His death, they said, was ultimately prevented by local firefighters who arrived at the scene. Demircan says he pulled out of the project not long afterwards, citing myriad concerns about how it was run, and by then he says the Sarot Group owed him almost $700,000 in unpaid wages. He describes how, after his initial complaint about environmental violations, he and Yerdelen attempted to sue one another for defamation, but their legal battles eventually fizzled out. His eventual showdown with Yerdelen took place at the Sarot Group\u2019s offices in Mudurnu, in the summer of 2016. Demircan says he arrived at the glass-fronted building to see Yerdelen\u2019s sleek black four-wheel-drive parked outside. Demircan tells me he didn\u2019t plan on getting violent, but describes a heated exchange with a man he says he recognised as an employee of Sarot, who moved to attack him. Demircan says he hit back, striking the man in the nose and mouth, after which Yerdelen abruptly sped off in his car. (Yerdelen denies the incident took place, or that Demircan was owed money.) The former contractor says he received a quarter of his fees, but others weren\u2019t so lucky. Demircan says he tracked down \u0130neg\u00f6l in 2018, at a street festival in Bolu, the provincial capital. Again, Demircan claims he threw a punch, before security and a local official intervened. \u0130neg\u00f6l says he only found out about this incident later from his security team. \u201cIf he made such an attempt, I didn\u2019t notice it,\u201d he says. Demircan says he then drove from the festival to Mudurnu, where he began to patrol in front of \u0130neg\u00f6l\u2019s house. When the local police got involved, along with the town prosecutor, Demircan abandoned his vendetta and left town. He hasn\u2019t returned to Mudurnu since, and has dropped his lawsuit alleging environmental damage and other complaints against the company. * * * By late 2016, it had started to become clear to Alfahhad, the Kuwaiti buyer, that construction work on the castles wasn\u2019t happening on schedule. The Sarot Group initially blamed the cold winter weather, then the after-effects of a failed military coup, which shook Turkey that July. Cant\u00fcrk and others in Mudurnu began to notice contractors were no longer showing up at the site, and suspected complaints about pay were to blame. As the months wore on, the Kuwaiti buyers began discussing other options. Some attempted to sue the Sarot Group, but the cases stalled. Alfahhad claims some members even attempted to introduce Yerdelen\u2019s co-director B\u00fclent Y\u0131lmaz to wealthy Kuwaiti investors who offered to take over the project, but that Y\u0131lmaz shrugged them off. Y\u0131lmaz declined to answer questions, claiming he left the Sarot Group in 2017, although records show he remained on its board until last year. The Sarot Group entered bankruptcy proceedings in 2018, with Yerdelen blaming the buyers for not making payments on time. Alfahhad shows me a document from the Sarot Group to prove that he has paid in full, and says Yerdelen\u2019s comments only irked them more. Sure enough, an Istanbul bankruptcy court ruled that the Sarot Group was comfortably in credit in late 2022. By this time Alfahhad and his group were despairing of the Turkish judicial system, believing that only diplomatic intervention could save their castles. He began using his connections as a former Kuwaiti prime ministerial adviser, calling the Kuwaiti foreign ministry and setting up a meeting with the Turkish ambassador to Kuwait. He also flew to Ankara several times to meet the Kuwaiti ambassador there, reassured by his pledge to treat the castles \u201clike an emergency\u201d and raise the issue at the highest echelons of the Turkish state. The issue appeared deadlocked until May this year, when the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, made a state visit to Ankara. Arriving in sunglasses and sweeping gold-fringed robes to a full military welcome, the emir met Erdo\u011fan, and the two leaders were pictured walking down a pale blue carpet to the presidential palace, their hands clasped. It was a welcome development for Alfahhad and the other buyers, who understood that the emir and Erdo\u011fan found time to discuss the hundreds of unfinished concrete castles. The Turkish presidency has declined to comment. Whatever took place behind the ornate doors of the presidential palace, the emir\u2019s visit does seem to have turned things around for Burj Al Babas. Or, in the words of lawyer Selim Sar\u0131ibrahimo\u011flu, who has advised the castle owners, it has \u201cpumped some warm blood into this issue\u201d. Now an Istanbul court that examines financial and organised crimes has taken up the case, and is combing through the Sarot Group\u2019s finances, as prosecutors accuse them of defrauding investors and using Burj Al Babas as a front company for suspicious transactions; Yerdelen says there is no truth to allegations of money laundering. All 14 of the companies run by Yerdelen and the Sarot Group, including those overseeing construction of the castles, have been entrusted to a Turkish state fund partially controlled by Erdo\u011fan\u2019s office and intended to rectify the finances of troubled businesses. Sar\u0131ibrahimo\u011flu points to a puzzle that has hung over the project for years: Yerdelen and the Sarot Group had millions of dollars in sales, more than enough to finish building the castles. Surely it would have been easier just to finish the project rather than endure these years of trouble? \u201cIt really is an odd thing,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they put themselves in this situation. But these things can always be solved at a political level. We are happy now that everything is under the control of the Turkish state.\u201d Others \u2013 like political consultant Selim Sazak \u2013 contend that the trickle-down corruption of the Turkish state under Erdo\u011fan is what allowed the castles to be built in the first place. \u201cThese people were powerful enough, socially and maybe politically, to get the construction permits they got and to market them to the Gulf,\u201d he says of the Sarot Group. The castles, he adds, are \u201ca monstrosity\u201d, a project that shows how even those with political connections far from the presidential palace \u201ccan end up doing something this brazen\u201d. As the court proceedings drag on, the castles remain untouched. The weeds and wildflowers have grown taller, but the project remains frozen in time. Yerdelen says he believes \u201cwith all my heart\u201d that his company will one day not only finish building the castles, but throw a grand opening party to celebrate. He dismisses state control of his companies as something \u201ctemporary\u201d, adding: \u201cWe plan to continue construction where we left off.\u201d Alfahhad also believes that he and the other buyers will eventually get their castles on the hillside, but not from the Sarot Group. Then there\u2019s the small matter of the late fees that the Sarot Group owe each buyer, which he says they intend to claim. The company currently owes him almost $150,000, half of what he paid for his castle; Yerdelen says buyers should direct their demands about fees to the Turkish state fund. \u201cWe remain optimistic that this will end soon \u2013 but of course it won\u2019t be like receiving one five or six years ago,\u201d says Alfahhad. \u201cSome of the other buyers lost loved ones \u2013 they died before this project was finished. They just wanted to go and sit in their castles.\u201d",

The take is Generation&nbsp;Z (Sunday 27 October, 9pm), the writer is Ben Wheatley, and I am delighted to say that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/11/sue-johnston-actor-family-values\">Sue Johnston</a> is one of the primary zombies. That rustling sound is me rubbing my hands together with glee.</p> <p>The set-up is: an army van carrying some sort of toxin has crashed outside Dambury care home, and the baby boomers inside transform into biters with a sudden taste for young flesh. Four teenagers \u2013 who all keep looking at their damn phones! \u2013 have to stop them. The army are also there but they are not much use.

The main thing is: the zombies are old, and the people they are trying to suck the blood and marrow from are young, and there\u2019s a message there, isn\u2019t there?

The initial toxic leak is done really quickly and, well, it just gets to the point. The show\u2019s gore is enjoyably ghoulish \u2013 somewhere between cartoon splatter and absolute horror \u2013 and the decision to make the zombies half-conscious while they do it was a smart one (Sue Johnston\u2019s extreme pang of guilt for eating the arteries of care workers is very good).

      "bodyText": "There was a sustained moment throughout the aughts where you couldn\u2019t move for zombies. Perhaps it started with 2002\u2019s 28 Days Later \u2013 little Cillian Murphy wandering dazed around a desolate Westminster! \u2013 but there were other takes on the shambling undead every couple of years: 2004\u2019s Shaun of the Dead, 2008\u2019s Dead Set, the novel Pride and Prejudice and Zombies in 2009, Left 4 Dead 2. Zombies quietened down a bit with the advent of 2010\u2019s The Walking Dead \u2013 a franchise that, ironically, refuses to die and keeps shuffling forward while making a low rustling sound \u2013 and we got into other things instead: Westworld\u2019s robots with souls, The Last of Us\u2019s mushroom monsters, every goth thing Game of Thrones could throw at us. The point is: sometimes zombies are popular, sometimes zombies go away. Zombies are popular, again. There have been rumbles for a while \u2013 Danny Boyle\u2019s 2025 sequel, 28 Years Later, looms; indie sleaze is back; and there are a load of new Walking Dead spin-offs creaking onwards for people who collect Funko Pops to watch \u2013 but the real proof that zombies are back is that Channel 4 are making an interesting and writer-led take on the beasts. The take is Generation Z (Sunday 27 October, 9pm), the writer is Ben Wheatley, and I am delighted to say that Sue Johnston is one of the primary zombies. That rustling sound is me rubbing my hands together with glee. The set-up is: an army van carrying some sort of toxin has crashed outside Dambury care home, and the baby boomers inside transform into biters with a sudden taste for young flesh. Four teenagers \u2013 who all keep looking at their damn phones! \u2013 have to stop them. The army are also there but they are not much use. There are some parents but they all have their own thing going on \u2013 there are some subplots that feel as if they\u2019ve got lost on their way to This Is England and decided to stick around \u2013 and the teachers aren\u2019t much use, either. The main thing is: the zombies are old, and the people they are trying to suck the blood and marrow from are young, and there\u2019s a message there, isn\u2019t there? If you do a lot of the thinking yourself and really squint, there\u2019s sort of a message there. There are a lot of things Generation Z gets right, so \u2026 I\u2019m just going to list some of them. The initial toxic leak is done really quickly and, well, it just gets to the point. The show\u2019s gore is enjoyably ghoulish \u2013 somewhere between cartoon splatter and absolute horror \u2013 and the decision to make the zombies half-conscious while they do it was a smart one (Sue Johnston\u2019s extreme pang of guilt for eating the arteries of care workers is very good). They put Robert Lindsay in it, which is always a good idea, and the whole thing manages to avoid some of my least favourite zombie tropes: guy who gets infected but hides it, a hand shooting through a blocked door, the whole world turning into chaos the second the first bite hits (there\u2019s a very funny sequence where, as zombies roam the countryside, Johnny Vegas still grumpily commutes to work). It\u2019s often good, never boring, and feels like a fresh take on a monster I have seen many, many times before. But most of all, Generation Z manages to make actual characters out of its teenagers, which I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen done yet. The concept of gen Z is still very new \u2013 the eldest person in the generation is 27, and I\u2019m not sure their totemic writer and cultural interpreter has stepped forward yet, and the youngest are 12 \u2013 and previous attempts to characterise them have been really bad, like in Douglas Is Cancelled. Wheatley\u2019s gen Zs \u2013 Buket Komur\u2019s Kelly, Viola Prettejohn\u2019s Finn, Lewis Gribben\u2019s Steff and Jay Lycurgo\u2019s Charlie; and I\u2019m only writing the names down here because at least two of them will go on to be very famous \u2013 are all superb, but have well-observed storylines beyond the outbreak (Gribben\u2019s Steff, for instance, gets radicalised by red-pill TikToks in a way that doesn\u2019t feel corny at all) that makes me, you know, care if they live or die. I\u2019m not sure how much the show really says \u2013 there\u2019s an intergenerational war going on here, of course, though I think that gets a little lost in the blood \u2013 but I\u2019m also not sure how much I actually care.

      "body": "<p>Climate campaigners have urged ministers to make steeper cuts in the UK\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions after the government\u2019s statutory adviser on the climate gave its verdict on new targets.</p> <p>The Climate Change Committee, which advises the government, has written to Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, to advise cuts of 81% in the UK\u2019s emissions, compared with 1990 levels, by 2035, if emissions from aviation and shipping are excluded.</p> <p>Miliband now faces the choice of whether to follow the committee\u2019s advice in setting the UK\u2019s new international commitment under the Paris agreement at a forthcoming UN climate summit.</p> <p>A cut of 81% as an international target would be broadly in line with the UK\u2019s existing domestic carbon budgets for the 2030s, which are also set with advice from the CCC and are intended to deliver net zero emissions by 2050.</p> <p>But campaigners urged the government to go further in order to demonstrate global leadership and spur innovation and a low-carbon economy. Mike Childs, the head of policy at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cWith climate change spiralling dangerously out of control, the recommended 81% cut should be seen as the very minimum carbon reduction target the UK government should commit to. Ramping up ambition to make even deeper cuts in practice would show real leadership in global efforts to avert the worst of climate breakdown.\u201d</p> <p>Catherine Pettengell, the executive director of Climate Action Network UK, said: \u201c[This] should be the floor, not the ceiling, of the UK\u2019s ambition and action. A more ambitious and fair target could be achieved if the UK brings its full economic and political will to the table.\u201d</p> <p>Meeting the new target will be a stretch. The UK is far away from meeting the international target in place of a 68% reductions in emissions by 2030, which was set by Boris Johnson before the UK hosted the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in 2021, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/05/uk-miss-paris-climate-targets-emissions\">according to analysis by Friends of the Earth</a>.</p> <p>Doug Parr, the policy director at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cTrue leadership means the government must also set out tangible plans to deliver on its 2035 target.\u201d He called for the fulfilment of Labour\u2019s promise to end new oil and gas licences, at least triple renewables and double energy efficiency rates by 2030, and support workers to transition away from polluting industries.</p> <p>Another key question for Miliband, in drawing up the UK\u2019s international target \u2013 known as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/29/carbon-offsetting-kyoto-protocol-and-ndcs-a-cop28-jargonbuster\">nationally determined contribution, or NDC, under the Paris agreement</a> \u2013 is how to account for emissions from international aviation and shipping to and from the UK.</p> <p>These emissions are now included in the UK\u2019s domestic carbon budgets, but were not explicitly in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/08/the-paris-agreement-five-years-on-is-it-strong-enough-to-avert-climate-catastrophe\">2015 Paris agreement</a>, and previous international pacts, because of the difficulty of apportioning the emissions to particular countries. Some campaigners argue that aviation and shipping are implicitly covered by the Paris agreement, but there is disagreement over this and most countries exclude them from their NDCs.</p> <p>Jonathan Hood, the UK sustainable shipping manager at the Transport &amp; Environment campaigning group, said they should be included. \u201cPassing responsibility for shipping emissions to the ineffective International Maritime Organisation and excluding them from the NDC makes no sense \u2013 particularly when the UK has already accepted legal responsibility for international shipping and aviation emissions by including them in the sixth carbon budget,\u201d he said.</p> <p>If aviation and shipping are included, in effect the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/22/miliband-faces-crunch-decision-on-speed-of-greenhouse-gas-cuts\">headline target for an NDC would be likely to equate to a cut of about 78% by 2035</a>, in line with the UK\u2019s carbon budgets.</p> <p>New NDCs are not due to be submitted to the UN until next February, but Keir Starmer promised that the UK\u2019s would be unveiled early, at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/17/cop29-at-a-crossroads-in-azerbaijan-with-focus-on-climate-finance\">forthcoming Cop29 UN climate summit</a>, taking place in Azerbaijan from 11 November.</p> <p>The prime minister <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-united-nations-general-assembly-speech-26-september-2024\">told other leaders at the UN general assembly in New York</a> last month: \u201cThe UK will lead again, tackling climate change, at home and internationally and restoring our commitment to international development. The threat of climate change is existential and it is happening in the here and now. So we have reset Britain\u2019s approach.\u201d</p> <p>Delivering the NDC early is intended to spur other major economies to do the same. However, the big <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/21/climate-activists-bemoan-scant-progress-on-finance-as-cop29-looms\">question mark hanging over Cop29</a> is whether Donald Trump will win the US presidential election, which takes place just five days before. Trump has vowed to dismantle the green industrial stimulus put in place by Joe Biden, boost fossil fuels, and withdraw the US from the Paris agreement.</p> <p>The UK met the <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/letter-advice-on-the-third-carbon-budget-carry-over/#:~:text=2.,pace%20and%20breadth%20of%20decarbonisation.\">first three five-year carbon budgets set under the Climate Change Act of 2008</a>, but current and future budgets look harder to meet. This carbon budget runs to 2027, and will be assessed at the end of this parliament in 2029. The fifth and sixth carbon budgets call for a cut of 58% in emissions by 2032, and 78% by 2037. The seventh carbon budget will be set by the CCC next year.</p> <p>Robert Jenrick, the Conservative leadership candidate, has pledged to repeal the Climate Change Act, and his rival in the contest, Kemi Badenoch, is also hostile to the UK\u2019s net zero ambitions.</p> <p>A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \u201cBritain is back in the business of climate leadership because the only way to protect current generations in the UK is by making Britain a clean energy superpower, and the only way to protect our children and future generations is by leading global climate action. </p> <p>\u201cWe are grateful to the Climate Change Committee for this expert advice, which we will consider carefully before we announce an ambitious nationally determined contribution target at Cop29 to help limit global warming to 1.5 degrees.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Climate campaigners have urged ministers to make steeper cuts in the UK\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions after the government\u2019s statutory adviser on the climate gave its verdict on new targets. The Climate Change Committee, which advises the government, has written to Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, to advise cuts of 81% in the UK\u2019s emissions, compared with 1990 levels, by 2035, if emissions from aviation and shipping are excluded. Miliband now faces the choice of whether to follow the committee\u2019s advice in setting the UK\u2019s new international commitment under the Paris agreement at a forthcoming UN climate summit. A cut of 81% as an international target would be broadly in line with the UK\u2019s existing domestic carbon budgets for the 2030s, which are also set with advice from the CCC and are intended to deliver net zero emissions by 2050. But campaigners urged the government to go further in order to demonstrate global leadership and spur innovation and a low-carbon economy. Mike Childs, the head of policy at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cWith climate change spiralling dangerously out of control, the recommended 81% cut should be seen as the very minimum carbon reduction target the UK government should commit to. Ramping up ambition to make even deeper cuts in practice would show real leadership in global efforts to avert the worst of climate breakdown.\u201d Catherine Pettengell, the executive director of Climate Action Network UK, said: \u201c[This] should be the floor, not the ceiling, of the UK\u2019s ambition and action. A more ambitious and fair target could be achieved if the UK brings its full economic and political will to the table.\u201d Meeting the new target will be a stretch. The UK is far away from meeting the international target in place of a 68% reductions in emissions by 2030, which was set by Boris Johnson before the UK hosted the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in 2021, according to analysis by Friends of the Earth. Doug Parr, the policy director at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cTrue leadership means the government must also set out tangible plans to deliver on its 2035 target.\u201d He called for the fulfilment of Labour\u2019s promise to end new oil and gas licences, at least triple renewables and double energy efficiency rates by 2030, and support workers to transition away from polluting industries. Another key question for Miliband, in drawing up the UK\u2019s international target \u2013 known as a nationally determined contribution, or NDC, under the Paris agreement \u2013 is how to account for emissions from international aviation and shipping to and from the UK. These emissions are now included in the UK\u2019s domestic carbon budgets, but were not explicitly in the 2015 Paris agreement, and previous international pacts, because of the difficulty of apportioning the emissions to particular countries. Some campaigners argue that aviation and shipping are implicitly covered by the Paris agreement, but there is disagreement over this and most countries exclude them from their NDCs. Jonathan Hood, the UK sustainable shipping manager at the Transport &amp; Environment campaigning group, said they should be included. \u201cPassing responsibility for shipping emissions to the ineffective International Maritime Organisation and excluding them from the NDC makes no sense \u2013 particularly when the UK has already accepted legal responsibility for international shipping and aviation emissions by including them in the sixth carbon budget,\u201d he said. If aviation and shipping are included, in effect the headline target for an NDC would be likely to equate to a cut of about 78% by 2035, in line with the UK\u2019s carbon budgets. New NDCs are not due to be submitted to the UN until next February, but Keir Starmer promised that the UK\u2019s would be unveiled early, at the forthcoming Cop29 UN climate summit, taking place in Azerbaijan from 11 November. The prime minister told other leaders at the UN general assembly in New York last month: \u201cThe UK will lead again, tackling climate change, at home and internationally and restoring our commitment to international development. The threat of climate change is existential and it is happening in the here and now. So we have reset Britain\u2019s approach.\u201d Delivering the NDC early is intended to spur other major economies to do the same. However, the big question mark hanging over Cop29 is whether Donald Trump will win the US presidential election, which takes place just five days before. Trump has vowed to dismantle the green industrial stimulus put in place by Joe Biden, boost fossil fuels, and withdraw the US from the Paris agreement. The UK met the first three five-year carbon budgets set under the Climate Change Act of 2008, but current and future budgets look harder to meet. This carbon budget runs to 2027, and will be assessed at the end of this parliament in 2029. The fifth and sixth carbon budgets call for a cut of 58% in emissions by 2032, and 78% by 2037. The seventh carbon budget will be set by the CCC next year. Robert Jenrick, the Conservative leadership candidate, has pledged to repeal the Climate Change Act, and his rival in the contest, Kemi Badenoch, is also hostile to the UK\u2019s net zero ambitions. A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \u201cBritain is back in the business of climate leadership because the only way to protect current generations in the UK is by making Britain a clean energy superpower, and the only way to protect our children and future generations is by leading global climate action. \u201cWe are grateful to the Climate Change Committee for this expert advice, which we will consider carefully before we announce an ambitious nationally determined contribution target at Cop29 to help limit global warming to 1.5 degrees.\u201d",

In 2018 \u2013 after serving just two years in Congress \u2013 she unseated Republican senator Dean Heller with a five-point margin, largely relying on support from the state\u2019s powerful labour unions and by emphasising her support for the Affordable Care Act and immigration reform. Heller had embraced Trump and voted to repeal the popular health care law.</p> <p>Six years later, Nevada \u2013 like the US at large \u2013 is much more politically polarised. Canvassers for the Libre Initiative, a conservative group affiliated with mega-donor Charles Koch\u2019s political network, have been messaging to mostly Latino voters that Rosen is closely tied with the Biden administration. \u201cShe voted 94% of the time with Joe Biden,\u201d said Eddie Diaz, a strategic director at Libre in Nevada. \u201cAnd people are not better off than they were before.\u201d</p> <p>But unlike many of her colleagues, Rosen has shied away from a national profile, forgoing the Democratic national convention in August in favour of staying in Nevada to campaign there.</p> <p>\u201cI think she\u2019s done a decent job so far, and that\u2019s largely because she\u2019s moderate, and bipartisan,\u201d said Kim, 66, a mental health and wellness educator who said she didn\u2019t want to share her full name because many of her family and clients are staunch Republicans.</p> <p>Her partner, Luis, 55, used to belong to the same synagogue as Rosen. \u201cIt\u2019s a small world,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Gladis Blanco, a political organiser with the Culinary Workers Union in Reno, said she credits Rosen for working with the administration to lower the cost of asthma medication. A single mother of three, Blanco said both she and several of her children have asthma \u2013 and new price caps on inhalers have transformed her family\u2019s monthly budget. \u201cWhen I tell voters about that they get so excited,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/25/ohio-senate-election-power-balance\">Can this Trump-backed car dealer unseat the Ohio Democrat and win Republicans the Senate?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile Miguel Martinez, a Reno city council member who has been canvassing on behalf of Rosen and Harris, said he was especially impressed that Rosen successfully fought against the US postal service plan to move all mail processing from its Reno facility to California, which locals, especially in remote regions of rural northern Nevada, worried would result in delayed medication deliveries and mail ballot processing. \u201cThat was a really big win in our community,\u201d he said.</p> <p>And much like her mentor Reid, who was famous for funnelling funds to the state, Rosen has managed to win allies by delivering federal aid to the state\u2019s cities and rural communities.</p> <p>In recent weeks, several rural Republican officials have backed Rosen over Brown \u2013 noting, simply, that they\u2019re happy with the incumbent\u2019s record. \u201cJacky Rosen helped bring Democrats and Republicans together to pass the largest infrastructure investment in a generation,\u201d said Nathan Robertson, the Republican mayor of the small eastern Nevada town of Ely. \u201cThat law is now leading to better and safer roads for our residents, including $24m in federal transportation funding to improve Ely\u2019s streets and sidewalks and revitalise our downtown.\u201d</p> <p>Ed Lawson \u2013 the Republican mayor of Sparks, a small city just outside Reno \u2013 similarly cited all the funding she has brought to his region. Just a day prior to his endorsement, Rosen and Cortez Masto announced that they had secured $275m in federal funding to enhance a major highway corridor east of Sparks.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a lifelong Republican who has never voted for a Democrat, but this November I\u2019ll be voting for Jacky Rosen,\u201d he said.</p> <p>***</p> <p>It has helped Rosen\u2019s cause that Brown has floundered though the election cycle.</p> <p>With early voting underway, the Senate Leadership Fund \u2013 the Republican party\u2019s main outside group supporting Senate races \u2013 announced it would spend an addition $6.2m on TV, radio and digital ads for Brown. But it\u2019s unclear if the funds will come too late.</p> <p>Brown has often leaned on his personal story in appeals to voters. In 2008, when he was a US army officer in Afghanistan, his Humvee hit a roadside bomb. The explosion caused third-degree burns and Brown had to endure dozens of reconstructive surgeries. The experience was transformative, Brown has said. \u201cGod saved me for a purpose,\u201d he wrote in a recent campaign email.</p> <p>But while he has made clear why he\u2019s running for office, he has struggled to define how for voters he would govern.</p> <p>Trump endorsed Brown just days before the primary elections and since then Brown has clung tightly to the former president and his platform. Brown said he wouldn\u2019t have supported the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law or the Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 Biden administration programs that have brought unprecedented federal dollars into the state and help fund a range of projects. His past support for storing nuclear waste in Nevada\u2019s Yucca Mountain \u2013 a third rail of politics in the state \u2013 has also left the impression that he is out of touch with Nevada.</p> <p>Such missteps have opened the opportunity for an easy critique \u2013 that Brown is a newcomer, one who moved from Dallas to Reno in 2018, and simply doesn\u2019t know enough about the state.</p> <p>His muddled stance on abortion has also played badly. In attack ads, Rosen has called Brown a \u201cMaga extremist\u201d who would take away abortion rights. And though Brown has responded by saying he supports Nevada\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jul/29/abortion-laws-bans-by-state\">current law</a>, which allows abortions up to 24 weeks \u2013 he has repeatedly dodged questions on whether he\u2019ll support the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/20/nevada-signatures-abortion-vote-november\">state\u2019s abortion ballot initiative</a>, which aims to enshrine Nevada\u2019s abortion rights in the state constitution.</p> <p>Nearly 70% of Republicans and 90% of Democrats <a href=\"https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-nevada-voters-want-expanded-birth-control-access-oppose-abortion-criminalization\">said they opposed</a> criminalising abortion, according to a recent poll by the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland.</p> <p>Diane Gutierrez, a 65-year-old real estate agent based in Reno, said she is personally opposed to abortion, due to her faith, but believes it should remain protected. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that that should be taken away from any woman,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not OK to go backwards.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/24/pennsylvania-state-senate-race-election\">This race could affect Pennsylvanians more than the presidential election.

Gladis Blanco, a political organiser with the Culinary Workers Union in Reno, said she credits Rosen for working with the administration to lower the cost of asthma medication. A single mother of three, Blanco said both she and several of her children have asthma \u2013 and new price caps on inhalers have transformed her family\u2019s monthly budget. \u201cWhen I tell voters about that they get so excited,\u201d she said. Meanwhile Miguel Martinez, a Reno city council member who has been canvassing on behalf of Rosen and Harris, said he was especially impressed that Rosen successfully fought against the US postal service plan to move all mail processing from its Reno facility to California, which locals, especially in remote regions of rural northern Nevada, worried would result in delayed medication deliveries and mail ballot processing. \u201cThat was a really big win in our community,\u201d he said. And much like her mentor Reid, who was famous for funnelling funds to the state, Rosen has managed to win allies by delivering federal aid to the state\u2019s cities and rural communities. In recent weeks, several rural Republican officials have backed Rosen over Brown \u2013 noting, simply, that they\u2019re happy with the incumbent\u2019s record. \u201cJacky Rosen helped bring Democrats and Republicans together to pass the largest infrastructure investment in a generation,\u201d said Nathan Robertson, the Republican mayor of the small eastern Nevada town of Ely. \u201cThat law is now leading to better and safer roads for our residents, including $24m in federal transportation funding to improve Ely\u2019s streets and sidewalks and revitalise our downtown.\u201d Ed Lawson \u2013 the Republican mayor of Sparks, a small city just outside Reno \u2013 similarly cited all the funding she has brought to his region. Just a day prior to his endorsement, Rosen and Cortez Masto announced that they had secured $275m in federal funding to enhance a major highway corridor east of Sparks. \u201cI\u2019m a lifelong Republican who has never voted for a Democrat, but this November I\u2019ll be voting for Jacky Rosen,\u201d he said. *** It has helped Rosen\u2019s cause that Brown has floundered though the election cycle. With early voting underway, the Senate Leadership Fund \u2013 the Republican party\u2019s main outside group supporting Senate races \u2013 announced it would spend an addition $6.2m on TV, radio and digital ads for Brown. But it\u2019s unclear if the funds will come too late. Brown has often leaned on his personal story in appeals to voters. In 2008, when he was a US army officer in Afghanistan, his Humvee hit a roadside bomb. The explosion caused third-degree burns and Brown had to endure dozens of reconstructive surgeries. The experience was transformative, Brown has said. \u201cGod saved me for a purpose,\u201d he wrote in a recent campaign email. But while he has made clear why he\u2019s running for office, he has struggled to define how for voters he would govern. Trump endorsed Brown just days before the primary elections and since then Brown has clung tightly to the former president and his platform. Brown said he wouldn\u2019t have supported the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law or the Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 Biden administration programs that have brought unprecedented federal dollars into the state and help fund a range of projects. His past support for storing nuclear waste in Nevada\u2019s Yucca Mountain \u2013 a third rail of politics in the state \u2013 has also left the impression that he is out of touch with Nevada. Such missteps have opened the opportunity for an easy critique \u2013 that Brown is a newcomer, one who moved from Dallas to Reno in 2018, and simply doesn\u2019t know enough about the state. His muddled stance on abortion has also played badly. In attack ads, Rosen has called Brown a \u201cMaga extremist\u201d who would take away abortion rights. And though Brown has responded by saying he supports Nevada\u2019s current law, which allows abortions up to 24 weeks \u2013 he has repeatedly dodged questions on whether he\u2019ll support the state\u2019s abortion ballot initiative, which aims to enshrine Nevada\u2019s abortion rights in the state constitution. Nearly 70% of Republicans and 90% of Democrats said they opposed criminalising abortion, according to a recent poll by the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland. Diane Gutierrez, a 65-year-old real estate agent based in Reno, said she is personally opposed to abortion, due to her faith, but believes it should remain protected. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that that should be taken away from any woman,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not OK to go backwards.\u201d A registered non-partisan, Gutierrez said she\u2019s voted for both Republican and Democratic candidates in the past. But in recent years, she has gotten more involved in volunteering with the Democratic party \u2013 and has largely steered clear of Republicans. \u201cThe party has had time, but they haven\u2019t selected good candidates,\u201d she said, adding they\u2019ve failed to make a good case to voters. Initially, she thought Brown bucked the trend. \u201cBeing from a military family \u2013 my dad was a marine \u2013 I appreciate Sam Brown and thank him for his service because obviously he paid a huge price,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the military, you have respect.\u201d But his failure to define a platform of his own has been disappointing, she said. \u201cI would like him to speak up more,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere\u2019s Sam Brown? Is he in Nevada? It\u2019s like, \u2018Sam \u2013 say something.\u2019\u201d",

The university keeps saying the tree is about to die and it\u2019s not going to last another year but it\u2019s in very good shape and is still fruiting. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it but it\u2019s very neglected and in an unloved state. The surrounding garden is in a bad state.\u201d</p> <p>Every single bramley apple ever eaten can be traced back to the tree, which was planted from a pip by a young girl, Mary Ann Brailsford, in the early 19th century. Brailsford moved out of the house after she married, and did not live to see the fame of the bramley apple.</p> <p>The apple was discovered and first sold by Merryweather in 1876, and was named after a later owner of the house and tree, Matthew Bramley.</p> <p>Merryweather grew grafts from the original tree and successfully produced more bramley apples. Nicknamed the \u201cKing of Covent Garden\u201d, the bramley became the only British cooking apple available all year round, its natural acidity adored by cooks.</p> <p>In 2002 the Queen\u2019s golden jubilee cited the original tree as one of the 50 \u201cgreat British trees\u201d in recognition of its national heritage. For the platinum jubilee of 2022, the bramley was one of 70 ancient trees dedicated to the Queen.</p> <p>Llywelyn Hall\u2019s newly unveiled painting, Swansong of the Mother Bramley, is on show in Southwell Minster during the bramley apple festival. Prints can be purchased via <a href=\"https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/bramley-apple-rescue-fund\">a crowdfunding page</a> to help rescue the tree.</p> <p>A Nottingham Trent University spokesperson said: \u201cThe university is incredibly proud to be custodian of the original bramley apple tree and recognises its significance to the local and wider community. The tree was dying due to an incurable honey fungus infection when NTU became its custodian and it has already outlived its natural life span by quite some time. At some point it will perish due to disease.</p> <p>\u201cDespite this, the tree still bears fruit and the university continues to work hard to look after it to try to prolong its life \u2026 While the tree sits in a private garden, which the university maintains, we open it up for members of the public upon request and also for events, such as the annual Heritage open day and bramley apple festival.\u201d</p>    <h2>Five unusual apple varieties</h2> <p><strong>The </strong><strong>bloody </strong><strong>ploughman</strong></p> <p>The secret to a successful apple is a good origin story. This historic variety, first described in 1883, was said to have grown from a bag of apples stolen by a ploughman who was shot for stealing. The resulting seedling was supposedly saved and nurtured by a fellow labourer. It sounds too perfect to be true, especially when its apples are naturally coloured a vivid blood-red.</p> <p><strong>Flower of Kent</strong></p> <p>This ancient variety \u2013 a red cooking apple rival to the bramley \u2013 is from Isaac Newton\u2019s apple tree. Newton developed his theory of gravity supposedly after watching an apple fall from the tree outside his window at Woolsthorpe Manor in Lincolnshire. Despite being blown down by a storm in 1820, the tree regrew from its original roots and numerous descendants and clones can be found \u2013 especially within universities \u2013 worldwide.</p> <p><strong>The </strong><strong>bardsey </strong><strong>apple</strong></p> <p>Residents of Ynys Enlli had <a href=\"https://www.bardsey.org/the-bardsey-apple\">enjoyed the fruits</a> from a knobbly tree on the tiny Welsh island for generations before they were spotted by Ian Sturrock, a holidaying fruit tree expert. The apple was declared the world\u2019s rarest variety when it was examined by experts and cuttings were taken from the tree the following spring to propagate more of the fruit. The bardsey apple, noted for its lemony aroma and flavour, could be the survivor of an orchard nurtured by monks who moved to the holy island more than 1,000 years ago.</p> <p><strong>The </strong><strong>bastard </strong><strong>foxwhelp</strong></p> <p>This variety is a small cider apple originating in Herefordshire. It sounds like an internet hoax but it was catalogued in the Herefordshire Pomona (1878-84). A small round apple, it has a smooth, glossy skin washed with bright red and darker stripes on the sun-exposed face. The origin of the name is unknown.</p> <p><strong>Roger Deakin\u2019s Kazakhstan apple</strong></p> <p>Roger Deakin was a co-founder of the charity <a href=\"https://www.commonground.org.uk/\">Common Ground</a>, which launched <a href=\"https://www.commonground.org.uk/apple-day/\">Apple Day</a> in 1990 to celebrate the thousands of local, historic apple varieties, many of which were in danger of being obliterated by tasteless supermarket-friendly fruit. On a trip to Kazakhstan, to research the wild ancestors of all domesticated apples, he pocketed some pips belonging to the ur-apple, <em>Malus sieversii. </em><a href=\"https://emergencemagazine.org/essay/east-to-eden/\">Potted by Deakin</a>, and rescued after his death by his successors, one tree planted by his friend Robert Macfarlane in a Cambridge garden continues to bear fruit.</p>",

But the original bramley apple has been neglected and barred from public view, according to descendants of the gardener who discovered it. The 220-year-old apple tree is still fruiting in the garden of a cottage in Southwell, the Nottinghamshire village that on Saturday hosts an annual festival celebrating the bramley apple. But Celia Stevens, great-granddaughter of Henry Merryweather, the man who first spotted the potential of the unique hybrid apple, says the owners of the cottage garden, Nottingham Trent University, are neglecting the tree. According to Stevens, the tree is surrounded by nettles, with honey fungus, a pathogen that is slowly killing the ageing tree, allowed to run rampant. \u201cWhen the university bought the cottage we thought, oh wonderful, they can now take care of the tree and the public can see its importance and what it represents,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s surrounded by nettles and I even saw some honey fungus when I was allowed to visit it. It\u2019s a tiny garden and its surrounds do not reflect this wonderful tree and what it\u2019s done for our country.\u201d The cottages that come with the garden, which were purchased by Nottingham Trent University in 2018, are used as student accommodation and there is no public access to enjoy the tree. The artist Dan Llywelyn Hall has painted the tree and will be raising money from the sale of prints of his paintings to present a fund to the university to pay for a maintenance programme for the tree and provide more public access. He says: \u201cIt\u2019s appalling that it\u2019s not open to the public. The university keeps saying the tree is about to die and it\u2019s not going to last another year but it\u2019s in very good shape and is still fruiting. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it but it\u2019s very neglected and in an unloved state. The surrounding garden is in a bad state.\u201d Every single bramley apple ever eaten can be traced back to the tree, which was planted from a pip by a young girl, Mary Ann Brailsford, in the early 19th century. Brailsford moved out of the house after she married, and did not live to see the fame of the bramley apple. The apple was discovered and first sold by Merryweather in 1876, and was named after a later owner of the house and tree, Matthew Bramley. Merryweather grew grafts from the original tree and successfully produced more bramley apples. Nicknamed the \u201cKing of Covent Garden\u201d, the bramley became the only British cooking apple available all year round, its natural acidity adored by cooks. In 2002 the Queen\u2019s golden jubilee cited the original tree as one of the 50 \u201cgreat British trees\u201d in recognition of its national heritage. For the platinum jubilee of 2022, the bramley was one of 70 ancient trees dedicated to the Queen. Llywelyn Hall\u2019s newly unveiled painting, Swansong of the Mother Bramley, is on show in Southwell Minster during the bramley apple festival. Prints can be purchased via a crowdfunding page to help rescue the tree. A Nottingham Trent University spokesperson said: \u201cThe university is incredibly proud to be custodian of the original bramley apple tree and recognises its significance to the local and wider community. The tree was dying due to an incurable honey fungus infection when NTU became its custodian and it has already outlived its natural life span by quite some time. At some point it will perish due to disease. \u201cDespite this, the tree still bears fruit and the university continues to work hard to look after it to try to prolong its life \u2026 While the tree sits in a private garden, which the university maintains, we open it up for members of the public upon request and also for events, such as the annual Heritage open day and bramley apple festival.\u201d Five unusual apple varieties The bloody ploughman The secret to a successful apple is a good origin story. This historic variety, first described in 1883, was said to have grown from a bag of apples stolen by a ploughman who was shot for stealing. The resulting seedling was supposedly saved and nurtured by a fellow labourer. It sounds too perfect to be true, especially when its apples are naturally coloured a vivid blood-red. Flower of Kent This ancient variety \u2013 a red cooking apple rival to the bramley \u2013 is from Isaac Newton\u2019s apple tree. Newton developed his theory of gravity supposedly after watching an apple fall from the tree outside his window at Woolsthorpe Manor in Lincolnshire. Despite being blown down by a storm in 1820, the tree regrew from its original roots and numerous descendants and clones can be found \u2013 especially within universities \u2013 worldwide. The bardsey apple Residents of Ynys Enlli had enjoyed the fruits from a knobbly tree on the tiny Welsh island for generations before they were spotted by Ian Sturrock, a holidaying fruit tree expert. The apple was declared the world\u2019s rarest variety when it was examined by experts and cuttings were taken from the tree the following spring to propagate more of the fruit. The bardsey apple, noted for its lemony aroma and flavour, could be the survivor of an orchard nurtured by monks who moved to the holy island more than 1,000 years ago. The bastard foxwhelp This variety is a small cider apple originating in Herefordshire. It sounds like an internet hoax but it was catalogued in the Herefordshire Pomona (1878-84). A small round apple, it has a smooth, glossy skin washed with bright red and darker stripes on the sun-exposed face. The origin of the name is unknown. Roger Deakin\u2019s Kazakhstan apple Roger Deakin was a co-founder of the charity Common Ground, which launched Apple Day in 1990 to celebrate the thousands of local, historic apple varieties, many of which were in danger of being obliterated by tasteless supermarket-friendly fruit. On a trip to Kazakhstan, to research the wild ancestors of all domesticated apples, he pocketed some pips belonging to the ur-apple, Malus sieversii. Potted by Deakin, and rescued after his death by his successors, one tree planted by his friend Robert Macfarlane in a Cambridge garden continues to bear fruit.",

Chope later was widely condemned for comments he made about the Tory leadership candidate Kemi Badenoch, saying he was backing her rival Robert Jenrick because Badenoch was \u201cpreoccupied with her own children\u201d. A government source said: \u201cThere are some really big issues on MPs\u2019 outside interests, complaints and culture that the committee is already taking forward. \u201cParliament has long debated sitting hours and what is best for one isn\u2019t good for others. Sitting hours have to balance the needs of MPs across the country. Many of the new MPs have their families outside London and want to sit longer over fewer days to be able to get back to their constituencies, for example. \u201cWhat\u2019s most important is that time in parliament is impactful, effective, and that MPs can better plan with more certainty.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Hospitals shelled, shelters set alight, men and boys separated from their families and taken away in military vehicles; a year into Israel-Hamas war, civilians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/12/northern-gaza-airstrikes-fighting-jabalia-evacuation\">clinging on in northern Gaza</a> say the situation is worse than it has ever been.</p> <p>About 400,000 people have remained in Gaza City and surrounding towns since Israel cut the area off from the rest of the territory and issued evacuation orders. Some are unwilling to leave home, afraid they will never be allowed to return; others decided to stay put for the sake of elderly or disabled family members. Civilians have reported that the routes to the relative safety of the south are unsafe, citing sniper fire and detention by Israeli forces.</p> <p>Now, many believe Israel is trying to finish the job with a new aerial and ground offensive on the area that has killed at least 800 people since it began on 6 October. Tightening the siege and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/15/us-israel-weapons-gaza-aid-letter\">cutting off aid</a> in order to force the remaining population to flee is outlined in a proposal known as \u201cthe generals\u2019 plan\u201d, presented to Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government last month. Experts say such tactics amount to war crimes.</p> <p>First responders have paused operations in northern Gaza altogether after crews were injured in airstrikes or detained by the military and their last fire engine was destroyed by tank shelling. The three struggling hospitals in the area say medical equipment is in such short supply that they are having to decide which patients they can help and which they have to let die. A near total blockade on aid deliveries mean that food and water are running dangerously low.</p>    <p>The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said on X this week: \u201cPeople suffering under the ongoing Israeli siege in north Gaza are rapidly exhausting all available means for their survival.\u201d</p> <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israeli government deny carrying out a deliberate \u201csurrender or starve\u201d campaign and say the new offensive is necessary to stop Hamas fighters regrouping. But the generals\u2019 plan, so called because it was put together by a group of retired military leaders, forms a clear blueprint.</p> <p>Sawsan Zaher, a Haifa-based Palestinian human rights lawyer, said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if Israel says it is doing this or not, if it calls it by a different name or not. What matters in international law is what is happening on the ground, and we can clearly see Israel is trying to erase the Palestinian presence in north Gaza.\u201d</p> <p>The stated aim of the generals\u2019 plan is to avoid a long war of attrition by putting as much pressure as possible on Hamas, forcing the group\u2019s surrender and the return of 100 hostages seized on 7 October 2023 and still held captive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/archive-zip-gaza_aid_2510/giv-4559AAcdA92sq071/\" data-alt=\"Graph showing aid deliveries into Gaza throughout 2024\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/archive-zip-gaza_aid_2510/giv-4559AAcdA92sq071/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The plan suggests giving Palestinians in northern Gaza an ultimatum to leave and then declaring the area a closed military zone. Those who remain would be considered combatants and therefore legitimate targets, it says. Water, food, fuel and medical supplies would be completely cut.</p> <p>After Hamas\u2019s surrender, the Gaza Strip would be permanently divided into two, with Israel in indefinite control in the north until a new civilian Palestinian administration could take over.</p> <p>Human rights groups have condemned the plan, saying it breaches international prohibitions on the use of food as a weapon and forcible transfers. Whether Israel is intentionally limiting the entry of food to Gaza is already a major plank of the genocide case against it at the international court of justice. Israel says humanitarian agencies are to blame for slow deliveries and Hamas is siphoning off aid.</p> <p>But with internationally mediated ceasefire and hostage release deal talks deadlocked since July, and Israel fighting a new war against Hezbollah in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon\">Lebanon</a>, observers say it appears Israel may be experimenting with a change in strategy in Gaza.</p> <p>\u201cThe bright lights aren\u2019t on Gaza any more, even though the Israeli government is making it very clear what they plan to do. The reason why is simple: because they can. The US, the UN, the EU; who is going to stop them?\u201d said Diana Buttu, a lawyer and former Palestinian peace negotiator.</p>    <p>Despite an expected revival of ceasefire talks next week, Israel is believed to be considering only a brief 12-day truce. Senior Israeli defence officials recently told the Israeli daily <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-10-13/ty-article/.premium/israeli-defense-officials-govt-pushing-aside-hostage-deal-eyeing-gaza-annexation/00000192-8585-d988-a3ba-dde59a470000\">Haaretz</a> that the government\u2019s wider aim was now annexing large parts of the Palestinian territory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/north_gaza_zone/giv-4559Ok7Gws5A9SHD/\" data-alt=\"Map of Gaza\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/north_gaza_zone/giv-4559Ok7Gws5A9SHD/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The generals\u2019 plan, or a version of it, would help towards that goal, although Gen Giora Eiland, the main author, told the Guardian that he opposed Israeli resettlement of the Gaza Strip. Siege was a valid tactic under international humanitarian law, he said, and the plan should be viewed as an alternative if a diplomatic solution to end the war could not be reached.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason we had a successful hostage deal in November is because two trucks of aid were going to Gaza a day and Hamas was desperate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that there is some clean way to fight and not kill civilians in modern war is naive \u2026 Many more Palestinians and many more Israelis will die if the war is not brought to an end as soon as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Michael Milstein, a Hamas expert and head of the Palestinian studies forum at Tel Aviv University, said he believed the generals\u2019 plan would not further Israel\u2019s two stated military goals in Gaza \u2013 the defeat of Hamas and the return of the hostages.</p> <p>\u201cAfter a year of fighting and even with [Yahya] Sinwar gone we should realise by now that even if we occupy the whole Strip, Hamas will not stop fighting,\u201d he said, referring to the recent killing of the group\u2019s leader in Rafah.</p> <p>\u201cThere are no good options for Israel in Gaza, but I worry this one will do even more damage to Israel\u2019s image. Many people in Israel still do not understand that the rest of the world does not see what is happening in north Gaza as a just war. That in itself is a big strategic problem.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hospitals shelled, shelters set alight, men and boys separated from their families and taken away in military vehicles; a year into Israel-Hamas war, civilians clinging on in northern Gaza say the situation is worse than it has ever been. About 400,000 people have remained in Gaza City and surrounding towns since Israel cut the area off from the rest of the territory and issued evacuation orders. Some are unwilling to leave home, afraid they will never be allowed to return; others decided to stay put for the sake of elderly or disabled family members. Civilians have reported that the routes to the relative safety of the south are unsafe, citing sniper fire and detention by Israeli forces. Now, many believe Israel is trying to finish the job with a new aerial and ground offensive on the area that has killed at least 800 people since it began on 6 October. Tightening the siege and cutting off aid in order to force the remaining population to flee is outlined in a proposal known as \u201cthe generals\u2019 plan\u201d, presented to Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government last month. Experts say such tactics amount to war crimes. First responders have paused operations in northern Gaza altogether after crews were injured in airstrikes or detained by the military and their last fire engine was destroyed by tank shelling. The three struggling hospitals in the area say medical equipment is in such short supply that they are having to decide which patients they can help and which they have to let die. A near total blockade on aid deliveries mean that food and water are running dangerously low. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said on X this week: \u201cPeople suffering under the ongoing Israeli siege in north Gaza are rapidly exhausting all available means for their survival.\u201d The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israeli government deny carrying out a deliberate \u201csurrender or starve\u201d campaign and say the new offensive is necessary to stop Hamas fighters regrouping. But the generals\u2019 plan, so called because it was put together by a group of retired military leaders, forms a clear blueprint. Sawsan Zaher, a Haifa-based Palestinian human rights lawyer, said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if Israel says it is doing this or not, if it calls it by a different name or not. What matters in international law is what is happening on the ground, and we can clearly see Israel is trying to erase the Palestinian presence in north Gaza.\u201d The stated aim of the generals\u2019 plan is to avoid a long war of attrition by putting as much pressure as possible on Hamas, forcing the group\u2019s surrender and the return of 100 hostages seized on 7 October 2023 and still held captive. The plan suggests giving Palestinians in northern Gaza an ultimatum to leave and then declaring the area a closed military zone. Those who remain would be considered combatants and therefore legitimate targets, it says. Water, food, fuel and medical supplies would be completely cut. After Hamas\u2019s surrender, the Gaza Strip would be permanently divided into two, with Israel in indefinite control in the north until a new civilian Palestinian administration could take over. Human rights groups have condemned the plan, saying it breaches international prohibitions on the use of food as a weapon and forcible transfers. Whether Israel is intentionally limiting the entry of food to Gaza is already a major plank of the genocide case against it at the international court of justice. Israel says humanitarian agencies are to blame for slow deliveries and Hamas is siphoning off aid. But with internationally mediated ceasefire and hostage release deal talks deadlocked since July, and Israel fighting a new war against Hezbollah in Lebanon, observers say it appears Israel may be experimenting with a change in strategy in Gaza. \u201cThe bright lights aren\u2019t on Gaza any more, even though the Israeli government is making it very clear what they plan to do. The reason why is simple: because they can. The US, the UN, the EU; who is going to stop them?\u201d said Diana Buttu, a lawyer and former Palestinian peace negotiator. Despite an expected revival of ceasefire talks next week, Israel is believed to be considering only a brief 12-day truce. Senior Israeli defence officials recently told the Israeli daily Haaretz that the government\u2019s wider aim was now annexing large parts of the Palestinian territory. The generals\u2019 plan, or a version of it, would help towards that goal, although Gen Giora Eiland, the main author, told the Guardian that he opposed Israeli resettlement of the Gaza Strip. Siege was a valid tactic under international humanitarian law, he said, and the plan should be viewed as an alternative if a diplomatic solution to end the war could not be reached. \u201cThe reason we had a successful hostage deal in November is because two trucks of aid were going to Gaza a day and Hamas was desperate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that there is some clean way to fight and not kill civilians in modern war is naive \u2026 Many more Palestinians and many more Israelis will die if the war is not brought to an end as soon as possible.\u201d Michael Milstein, a Hamas expert and head of the Palestinian studies forum at Tel Aviv University, said he believed the generals\u2019 plan would not further Israel\u2019s two stated military goals in Gaza \u2013 the defeat of Hamas and the return of the hostages. \u201cAfter a year of fighting and even with [Yahya] Sinwar gone we should realise by now that even if we occupy the whole Strip, Hamas will not stop fighting,\u201d he said, referring to the recent killing of the group\u2019s leader in Rafah. \u201cThere are no good options for Israel in Gaza, but I worry this one will do even more damage to Israel\u2019s image. Many people in Israel still do not understand that the rest of the world does not see what is happening in north Gaza as a just war. That in itself is a big strategic problem.\u201d",

In case you haven\u2019t heard, it\u2019s the Dodgers and the Yankees bidding for the oversized heavy and expensive jewellery, something they\u2019ve done 11 times prior: seven times via Bronx/Brooklyn NYC subway and four times via continental jet. It\u2019s the first time since they\u2019ve met in the Fall Classic since the Dodgers beat the Yanks in 1981.</p> <p>Both clubs are under enormous pressure to win a World Series title. The Dodgers won in the Covid-19 season of 2020 which, let\u2019s be honest, few take seriously. The Yankees are in their first World Series since 2009, the longest such gap in appearances since the franchise\u2019s founding in 1903. Babe Ruth helped the New York Americans into their first Fall Classic in 1921 v the Giants \u2013 a series played in Manhattan\u2019s Polo Grounds, not in the yet to be built big ballpark in the Bronx.</p> <p>Who has more pressure to win? Personally, I think since Yankees ownership has morphed into accountants under Hal Steinbrenner, son of the less patient George, it\u2019s the Dodgers that need to win this series more. New York just seem happy to be there, which is un-Yankee like to say the least.</p> <p>Both of these teams are loaded with star sluggers and strong bullpens, but the high-profile, overpowering starting pitcher that teams fear facing are notably absent.</p> <p>Gerrit Cole, the solid but not currently spectacular Yankees ace has been inconsistent in a season shortened by elbow inflammation experienced this spring. He\u2019ll start for New York tonight in Game 1. The Dodgers best arm, Yoshinobu Yamamoto has also had his issues, but can hardly complain about his first season in MLB after arriving from Japan this spring. He\u2019ll pitch in Game 2 tomorrow. Tonight LA sends Jack Flaherty to the hill. Acquired from Detroit at the trade deadline, he\u2019s been a reliable arm for the Dodgers, although the Mets roughed him up in Game 5 of the NLCS, after he shut New York down in Game 1.</p> <p>There\u2019s some pomp and circumstance before first pitch, which is scheduled for 17:08 LA time. Team introductions and the my traditional national anthem are yet to come. So sit back, relax pop some corn and grab a bevy.

In between, great pitching performances from Cole and Flaherty, another key home run from Stanton, great defense and base running from Jazz Chisholm, a dramatic choice of Nestor Cortes to enter into the game in a huge spot and so ,uch more. The Yankees did almost everything to win this game, and then lost in absolutely bone crushing fashion. And tomorrow they face Yamamoto needing to win and avoid heading to the Bronx in a 2-0 hole. It left me breathless, that\u2019s what drama filled, high stakes sports can do. Thank you Game 1! And that\u2019s it from us! Wherever you are, thanks for following along! Good morning, good afternoon and goodnight! The first walk-off grand slam in World Series history! It happened in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series and it happened again tonight! Hearing a hero \u201cThat\u2019s the stuff when your five years old in the back yard, that\u2019s a dream come true.\u201d \u2013 Freddie Freeman talking to FOX television in the US after hitting a walk off grand slam to win Game 1 of the World Series! And we didn\u2019t even know if he could play tonight! Freeman takes the first pitch and sends it into the right field stands! He knew it right away, lifting his bat in celebration! It\u2019s a game-winning 10th inning home run for Freeman, doing his best Kirk Gibson impression, winning a World Series game on one foot! Wow! Yankees 3-2 Dodgers, bottom 10th Ohtani fouls it off to the left side, Verdugo is running hard towards the wall. Does he have room? Yes! He makes the catch and falls into the stands, Jeter style, sort of. The runners move up because Verdugo fell into the stands but what a catch! Amazing! So now Betts is intentionally walked, that loads the bases. Freddie Freeman will be tasked with getting a single that can score two Dodgers and win this game for LA! Yankees 3-2 Dodgers, bottom 10th Cortes v Ohtani, with the tying run at second base and the winning run at first. One out. Here we go! Yankees 3-2 Dodgers, bottom 10th Cousins is ahead 0-1 after an atrocious call by the home plate umpire on a ball clearly outside. Then a pitch in the inside of the plate is ruled a strike. That was borderline, but probably correct. Now Edman slaps a ball to the right side that Cabreara, who leans over to try and make the stab, but he can\u2019t handle it! Everyone is safe, two one and one out for Shohei Ohtani! This game keeps giving! And how about this: Yankees starter, now reliever, Nestor Cortes, who was deemed out for the season, probably, and hasn\u2019t pitched in a month, is coming in to face the baseball god from Oshu with it all on the line! Wow, this is good! Chris Taylor is in to pinch run for Lux who is at second base. Yankees 3-2 Dodgers, bottom 10th Cousins walks Lux. Walks are never, ever good. They don\u2019t usually end well. How about now? Edman is heading to the plate to try and move Lux around. Yankees 3-2 Dodgers, bottom 10th OK, Jake Cousins is in for New York to try and close out LA. He faces Will Smith first. The Dodgers catcher skies to right field for the first out. Gavin Lux is next. How the Yankees took the lead in the 10th Will New York hang on? Yankees 3-2 Dodgers, top 10th Wells, an automatic out, is automatically out on a strikeout. Inning over, but the Yankees take the lead after Chisholm steals two bases in an electric Yankees 10th! Can the Dodgers answer? With the infield in, a sharp hit grounder to short \u2013 Edman, who is playing in, making the play that much tougher, rushes because he wants to end the inning with a double play, but he bobbles it! Chisholm comes home to score, Rizzo is out at second base! Volpe is on at first! And then he steals second base! So action everywhere and a Yankees lead! Yankees 2-2 Dodgers, top 10th It\u2019s 2-2 after Volpe checks his swing at a pitch away. Yankees 2-2 Dodgers, top 10th Volpe v Treinen. It\u2019s 0-1 and Treinen has a look at Chisholm at second. Next pitch, Chisholm takes off for third \u2013 no throw! So the go ahead run is at third, a sac fly away! Yankees 2-2 Dodgers, top 10th Chisholm steals second, so now he\u2019s in scoring position for Rizzo with one out! And Rizzo is ahead in the count, 3-0. Now they\u2019ll walk him to set up an inning ending double play and multiple force plays LA pitching coach Mark Prior is out for a chat with Treinen. Yankees 2-2 Dodgers, top 10th Stanton hit his 17th career postseason homer earlier this game. Now he faces Treinen to start the inning, and waves at a breaking pitch away! Strike three! Now Chisholm steps to the plate and promptly slaps a single to right field! Betts makes a great run to keep the ball from going to the wall, hoding Jazz to a single. Rizzo is next. Yankees 2-2 Dodgers, bottom 9th Hernandez hits a ball to shallow left! Verdug runs in, slides and makes a fantastic catch! That ends the inning with a defensive exclamation point for the Yankees! We have extra innings in Game 1 of the World Series! And there\u2019s no ghost runners in the post-season. Yankees 2-2 Dodgers, bottom 9th Well, if you were looking for crisp, tight, well played baseball, with some late, wild antics, you\u2019ve found it! Muncy is ahead 3-1 on Weaver, but then he skies a change up to second base for the second out. So it\u2019s up to Hernandez, who does have a flair for the dramatic. Yankees 2-2 Dodgers, bottom 9th So here\u2019s Teoscar Hernandez to face Weaver. Oswaldo Hernandez is in to play second base for New York after Jasson Dominguez pinch ran for Torres last inning. Hernandez pokes a ball to right fielder for the out. Here\u2019s Max Muncy, and he\u2019s had three home runs off Weaver. Gulp! Yankees 2-2 Dodgers, top 9th Judge swipes at a high fastball and pops it up to short! Easy for Edman, inning over! and what an inning it was! Hernandez, Muncy and Hernandez due up for LA\u2019s bottom of the ninth as they try to escape Game 1 with a victory! Yankees 2-2 Dodgers, top 9th They walk Soto to face Judge, righty on righty. It seems crazy and also makes perfect sense. First and second, two outs, tie game, 1-2 to Judge. How will it end? Not this time! Yankees 2-2 Dodgers, top 9th With Soto on deck and Judge in the hole, Torres gets ahead in the count 2-1. Then he hits a deep drive and that\u2019s a home run!!! But wait! A fan has reached over and caught the ball! That\u2019s fan interference! Except unlike the 1996 ALCS, when Jeffrey Maier slapped a Derek Jeter fly ball into the stands at Yankee Stadium for a home run against the Baltimore Orioles, we have instant replay to fix this nonsense. So that means Torres is placed at second base, and Soto comes to the plate. Roberts is coming to get Kopech, Blake Treinen is coming in to try and keep this game tied! Wild! Yankees 2-2 Dodgers, top 9th The Yanks weak bottom half is coming up: Wells grounds to second for their first out off new Dodger righty reliever Michael Kopech Now Verdugo bounces out to third. Two down. It\u2019s up to Torres in the Yankees ninth. Yankees 2-2 Dodgers, bottom eighth Freeman flies to center for the third out, but we\u2019re tied at two a piece heading into the ninth inning! Betts hits a scorcher to center \u2013 Judge makes the catch, Ohtani tags up to score, tie game! The good news for New York, bases clear, two down. Here\u2019s Freddie Freeman. Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, bottom eighth OK, Ohtani is on third, and the Yankees infield is in. Weaver faces Betts who is behind in the count 1-2 in the biggest of spots here. Ohtani nearly had his first World Series home run, but he\u2019s still on third base. Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, bottom eighth Ohtani hits a line drive that just falls short of a game tying homer! He\u2019s into second base. But Volpe can\u2019t handle a bounced throw from the right fielder, Soto, so Ohtani heads over to third base! So now Ohtani is 90 feet away from tying this game, and Boone is out to get Khanle! The Yankees closer, Luke Weaver is heading in to face Mookie Betts with one out! Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, bottom eighth Edman is behind 0-2 to Kahnle, who remains in the game, for now. He gets Edman to bounce out to short. One down, here\u2019s Ohtani looking to tie this game with a single swing! Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, top eighth Volpe flies out to center, inning over. Ohtani will bat second in LA\u2019s half of the eighth inning. The NLCS MVP Edman, who is all over the place again tonight, leads off. Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, top eighth Volpe is up with two down and nobody on, and the count is even at 2-2. How will it end? Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, top eighth Now Vesia strikes out Rizzo. Two down. Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, top eighth A lefty, Vesia, added to the LA\u2019s roster today, is in to face Chisholm, who made a key play with his glove a short while ago. Chisholm is blown away for the first out. Here\u2019s Rizzo. The line on Cole What can you say, the man delivered tonight. 6IP 6H 1R 1ER 0BB 4K 0HR No free passes, that\u2019s the key. You can\u2019t give a lineup like this anything for free, and he didn\u2019t. Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, bottom seventh Lux grounds to second base, Torres shifts to his right, has the ball, throws it to first and the inning is over! The Yankees survive two on and nobody out to hold onto a one-run lead! Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, bottom seventh Kahnle has been lights out these playoffs: six games, seven innings, no runs. It\u2019s all about his changeup. What will Lux do v Kahnle? Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, bottom seventh Hernandez bunts! And successfully! the runners advance as Wells pops out to make the play and get Hernandez at first. But now Smith pops a sinker to shortstop for an easy second out! Can the Yankees escape this threat? Boone is coming out to get Holmes! A new pitcher is coming in to face Gavin Lux, who will try to save this inning! that\u2019s Tommy Kahnle. Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, bottom seventh One on and nobody out for Muncy. Holmes nearly hits Muncy as the ball goes to the backstop. Hernandez advances, and now they say Muncy was hit! That means two on and no outs \u2013 the Dodgers are threatening, and Hernandez, Mr Dodgers clutch, steps into the batters box to face Holmes! Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, bottom seventh Holmes, the one-time closer before being demoted in favor of new closer Luke Weaver has been a bit better in this role of middle man. Now he faces Smith is a big spot against max Muncy. Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, bottom seventh That\u2019s it for Cole! Wow! I thought he was good enough to try one more batter, but Boone thought otherwise. So the Yankees ace is done, and their bullpen will take over. Clay Holmes enters for the Yankees. Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, bottom seventh Cole has thrown just 82 pitches and is back out to pitch the seventh inning for New York. His first assignment is the dangerous Hernandez, and the count is even at 2-2. Cole has been in big spots before with the Yankees and hasn\u2019t always been at his best, but that\u2019s not the case so far tonight. He\u2019s been absolutely fantastic. Now the count is full: here\u2019s the payoff pitch and it\u2019s lined to center for a lead off base hit for LA! Muncy is next and Boone is out to talk to Cole. is that it for the Yankees ace? Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, top seventh Stanton goes down swinging and the inning is over! It\u2019s stretch time in LA with the home team down a run. Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, top seventh Signs of life from Judge \u2013 a single to center. It\u2019s not sexy, but he\u2019ll take it, and maybe that\u2019s a sign of more things to come from the future AL MVP. Giancarlo Stanton, who has done the Yankee damage tonight, is now back in the batters box to face the righty. Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, top seventh Brusdar Graterol, who hasn\u2019t seen action in a month, is in to face the Yankees beef. Torres taps back to the pitcher, Graterol casually bare hands it and throws to first for the first out of the inning. You can\u2019t be any smoother than Graterol on that play, whop looked like he was fielding in a beer league Sunday game. Now Soto steps in, and he pops up a 3-2 pitch to shortstop for the second out. Here\u2019s Judge. A fourth strikeout for him would mean a \u201cgolden sombrero\u201d on the night. The line on Jack The Dodgers hurler did it all, with the exception of one pitch, which Stanton took to the moon. 5.1 IP 5H 2R 2ER 1BB 6K 1HR Almost jack, almost. Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, bottom sixth Cole is ahead 1-2 on Betts. Now he watches a fastball away \u2013 it\u2019s 2-2. Huge moment here! Betts fouls off a fastball away, then scorches a line drive to third that bounces right in front of Chisholm \u2013 he has it, and throws to first in time to get Betts. Wow! What glove from Jazz! Then Freeman skies to deep right but not deep enough! Soto has it, inning over! LA can\u2019t get a lead off double in to score as Cole puts the hammer down! Six great innings from the Yankees ace! Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, bottom sixth Ohtani bounces a ball up the middle \u2013 it\u2019s going to be close! Ohtani is steaming down the line but the throw by Volpe is a bullet! One down, but now the tying run is 90 feet away, standing at third base for Mookie Betts. The Yankees move the infield in. Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, bottom sixth Edman is everywhere! The NLCS MVP hits a double down the right field line, and now Ohtani is coming up with traffic on the bases. First big test here for Cole in a big spot. Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, top sixth Verdugo strikes out! Inning over, but not before a crushed two-run blast from Stanton! Advantage new York! Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, top sixth Will Wells make LA pay? Wells hits a ball to the right of the second base bag \u2013 Edman, the shortstop runs and dives to his left and stops the ball! There\u2019s no play at first, but the play keeps Chisholm from scoring a third Yankees run. Spectacular run-saving defense from LA! So that means it\u2019s now up to Alex Verdugo to deliver a two out RBI. Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, top sixth Rizzo waves at a pitch away and Banda has a strikeout. Two down for Volpe, but Dave Roberts is going to put him on intentionally so Banda, a lefty, can face Wells, a switch hitter who will bat from the left side. Yankees 2-1 Dodgers, top sixth So now it\u2019s the Dodgers bullpen that\u2019s under the microscope after Flaherty is chased. FOX TV tells us that the damaged Dodgers rotation has pitched just 40% of postseason innings thus far. The leaned on bullpen has mostly pitched well, but here the lefty Banda is greeted rudely with a single to right field by Jazz Chisholm. Now Chisholm steals second base \u2013 the Yankees are cooking in the sixth! Can Rizzo keep the line moving? This one is not coming back! I think it\u2019s safe to say that if Stanton continues to do this these playoffs, all his disappointing, high priced, injury-riddled regular seasons will be forgiven by Yankees fans. Giancarlo Stanton launches a mammoth 412 foot shot to right field! And Flaherty\u2019s lone mistake is deposited into the seats and gives New York the lead! Dave Roberts is out to get his man: Anthony Banda will pitch in relief! Yankees 0-1 Dodgers, top sixth Wow! Judge, swing and a miss and he\u2019s down for the third time on strikes! Will Stanton pick and continue his monster postseason? Flaherty is ahead 0-2! Yankees 0-1 Dodgers, top sixth Can the Yankees answer? Flaherty is now facing the Yanks beef for the third time, and Soto leads off with a single! And here comes Judge! Yankees 0-1 Dodgers, bottom fifth Anthony Rizzo heads over to Cole to have a chat with the hurler in case he needs a bit of a pick-me-up after surrendering the first run of the 120th World Series. Two outs, nobody on base for the eight spot, and that\u2019s Lux. He pops out to center field, Judge puts it away and that\u2019s the inning. But we have a run! Will Smith pops to shallow right, Hernandez is tagging at third. Soto guns it home \u2013 this is going to be close! Smith is in to score! The Dodgers are on the board and have a lead! Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, bottom fifth Cole is ahead yet again, o-2 against Hernandez. But then Hernandez pokes a high fastball into the opposite field right field corner! Soto can\u2019t get to it in time! Kike is running for third and he\u2019s in there! It\u2019s a one-out triple and the Dodgers are a fly ball away for a lead. Here\u2019s Will Smith! Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, bottom fifth You know Cole has it if Max Muncy is bunting, which happened, and he slaps it foul. That\u2019s shows you how much trouble Cole has been for Dodger hitters, and Muncy swings through a fastball for another Cole K! One down! Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, top fifth Top of the Yanks lineup means Torres is at the plate. He bounces to third, Muncy charges, picks a tricky hop and fires to first \u2013 in time! Inning over! Flaherty is through five innings, confident and wildly effective! He\u2019s 74 pitches in! Could he get through seven? Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, top fifth Look at this! A base hit! Verdugo singles to center with two outs! Is this a trend? Stay tuned to find out. Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, top fifth Now Flaherty has five strikeouts. Wells is totally defenseless, which is normal for Wells. How did he stay in the Yankees four hole for so long? (Cashman) Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, top fifth Anthony Volpe is quickly behind 0-2. Now he\u2019s on the bench, having fallen victim to a fourth Flaherty K. Can Wells do any better? Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, bottom fourth Here\u2019s Hernandez, my pick for series MVP, and the count is even, 2-2. A cutter low and away makes the count full. Now Hernandez pops another cutter to short where Edman has it as the fourth inning comes to a close. Just 51 pitches for Cole! Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, bottom fourth Cole breaks Freeman\u2019s bat, twice in two pitches. It\u2019s a ground ball to first that Rizzo will take himself for the second out. Cole has thrown just 45 pitches thus far, super economical. Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, bottom fourth It\u2019s Cole v Betts to start the bottom of the fourth, and the Yankees hurler gets ahead 0-2. Betts evens the count at two before Betts hits a ball to no mans land to shallow right field \u2013 it\u2019s the first baseman Rizzo who is chasing and he makes a fantastic over the shoulder catch! He robbed Betts of a bloop hit! One down! Here\u2019s Freeman, who had a triple in his first at-bat. Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, top fourth Nasty knuckle curve ball to Rizzo for a swinging strike two before the Yanks first baseman pokes a ball to shallow left field. It\u2019s easy for Teoscar Hernandez who makes an easy catch to retire the side. It\u2019s Flaherty\u2019s first 1-2-3 inning of the night, which has taken just 60 pitches. Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, top fourth Moving right along, Stanton flies out to right, Chisholm bounces to second, and two quick outs for Flaherty, who has now navigated through the beef of the Yankees lineup twice and lives to tell the tale! Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, bottom 3rd Just looking at Ohtani, it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone getting him out. The count is 2-2, with Ohtani just missing a fastball, fouling it back. Now Cole shows Ohtani Uncle Charlie and the slugger swings and misses! It\u2019s Cole\u2019s third strikeout, and like Flaherty, has been superb. It seems we have a duel of the pitchers. Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, bottom 3rd Dodger manager Dave Roberts, speaking to FOX TV in the US thinks Flaherty\u2019s \u201cspin is good and the fastball is playing up\u201d \u2013 he\u2019s happy with his hurler and why not, he\u2019s been tremendous. Meanwhile, bottom of the Dodger lineup is heading to the plate, starting with Lux, who lines out to right. Now Edman is up and promptly pops into foul territory on the right side of the infield. Rizzo is in to make the catch, and so it\u2019s two down for Ohtani, which is good news for Cole and the Yankees, because nobody is on base. Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, top 3rd Judge struck out last at-bat and now he\u2019s behind 0-2 to Flaherty. Judge fouls off a pitch, looks at a ball in the dirt, and that waves at a curve ball low. Swing and a miss! So 52 pitches from Flaherty has him unscathed through three innings with three k\u2019s to boot. You can\u2019t ask for anything more from Flaherty, who was beaten up badly by the Mets in his last start. Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, top 3rd It\u2019s 2-2 and Flaherty throws a curve ball in the dirt to even the count. The payoff pitch is hit up the middle \u2013 Edman is behind the second base bag, scoops it up, runs to second to get one out, then fires over to first, in time to get Soto! Double play! So now Judge is up with nobody on, which is what Dodgers fans want exactly. Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, top 3rd Flaherty sees the Yankee lineup for the second time now and Torres strikes a pitch to the hole in short \u2013 I mean super deep! Edman dives, has it, and nearly nails the Yankees second baseman. What a play! Third straight inning the Yanks have the leadoff runner on. Can they get him around? Here\u2019s Soto to give it a whirl. Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, bottom 2nd As we were saying, Cole is throwing darts: his sixth pitch to Smith is too much for the backstop. Two strikeouts for Cole as we head to the third inning, scoreless. Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, bottom 2nd Cole chucks high cheese at Hernandez who just waves. Strike three! For sure, Cole has it so far tonight, which we can\u2019t always say. Two out. Catcher Will Smith is at the plate. Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, bottom 2nd Cole is back on the hill as we resume, facing Max Muncy. He pops up into foul ground on the third base side: Chisholm is running hard and m,akes the catch for out number one. Playoff animal Kike Hernandez is next. Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, top 2nd A Yankee lead? Nope. Verdugo bounces to second and it\u2019s easy for Lux who has it and throws to first base for the out. Side retired. Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, top 2nd Wells hits a ball in the hole closer to first base. Lux runs to his right, chases it down and throws in time to the bag for the second out. Rizzo advances to second on the play. That means Alex Verdugo could potentially give New York a lead with a knock here. Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, top 2nd Flaherty is ahead on Volpe 1-2 before dealing a fastball away that just misses. Even 2-2 count now and Flaherty throws a curveball that Volpe can only whiff at \u2013 strike three! One down for LA here in the second. Austin Wells, a light-hitting catcher heads to the dish. Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, top 2nd So now we get into the less scary part of the Yankees lineup: Anthony Rizzo is leading off. Except Rizzo hits it back to and off Jack Flaherty, nailing the bottom of his ankle, and there\u2019s no play. So for the second straight inning New York has the lead runner on. Here\u2019s the 23-uyear-old shortstop, Anthony Volpe. The reader says\u2026 I don\u2019t know who Karloff is, but could he hit a triple on one leg? Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, bottom 1st Hernandez hits a liner to short and Anthony Volpe handles it for the third out, ending the inning for Cole and the Yankees. So Freeman is left standing at third base and we\u2019re scoreless through one. Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, bottom 1st Now Mookie Betta is at the plate and he hits another deep fly ball, this one is to left field! And Dodger Stadium holds it in again \u2013 Alex Verdugo makes the catch for a second loud out! Freddie Freeman is next, and he strikes a shot to left! It takes an odd bounce off the side wall, Verdugo has to chase it! Hobbling Freeman, who hasn\u2019t had an extra base hit is testing that ankle, running past second base and into third! Wow! His ankle passes the test, for now. Can Teoscar Hernandez drive him home? Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, bottom 1st So here\u2019s Ohtani to face Gerrit Cole, who for a time v New York in the NLCS struggled with nobody on base. First pitch, and it\u2019s a high fly ball, deep to center field! Aaron Judge is on the warning track, has room and makes the catch! Ohtani nearly sent Cole fastball over the fence, but it\u2019s just a loud out. Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, top 1st Chisholm bounces to second, Gavin Lux has it, fires to first for the out, and that\u2019s the inning. So New York leave two on and here comes Shohei Ohtani and the Dodgers in their half of the opening inning. Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, top 1st Flaherty falls behind Stanton, 3-1 before the slugger let\u2019s a close strike go by. On a full count, Stanton hits a grounder to short that Edman bobbles! No throw to first, and now it\u2019s two runners on and two outs for Jazz Chisholm. LA had a bit of the bobblies v the Mets, and they really can\u2019t afford such haphazard defense. Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, top 1st A pinpoint fastball and a tight slider has Flaherty up 0-2 v Judge. The next pitch is a breaking ball in the dirt, ball one. Now it\u2019s a slider and Judge is ahead of it, swinging and missing \u2013 strike three! Judge continues to struggle in the postseason. Giancarlo Stanton, up next, has been the opposite, winning the ALCS MVP. Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, top 1st Flaherty walks Soto on four pitches, which is not desirable considering Aaron Judge is walking into the batters box. Yankees 0-0 Dodgers, top 1st Torres hits a ball on the screws to third base, but it\u2019s right into the glove of Max Muncy. One outfor Jack Flaherty, who now faces a stiffer test, Juan Soto. The match-up of the two best players in baseball, Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge, is finally underway at Dodger Stadium under sunny skies and perfect weather! Los Angeles\u2019 own Jack Flaherty delivers a ball to Gleyber Torres! Let\u2019s go! National Anthem Country music star and Dodgers superfan is signing the national anthem while strumming his electric guitar. It\u2019s a bit slow and low energy. I\u2019m not really into it this at all. I\u2019m giving it a 6.5/10, and that\u2019s wildly low for me. This is what it sounded like when Mr Paisley performed at the 2017 World Series. First pitch is coming soon. Please stand by! First pitch Steve Yeager, a catcher who played on the 1981 Dodger champions, and Orel Hershiser who pitched for the 1988 Dodger title winners are out to throw the ceremonial first pitches. But to honor the passing of the legendary, trailblazing Mexican hurler Fernando Valenzuela, who died this week, the ball was not thrown, but placed next to his no34 etched on the mound. Lineups The players are being introduced at Dodger Stadium. Hard to hear who is getting the loudest boos and cheers over the music, which used to be fun. Oh well. Here\u2019s the starting lineups, which for LA include former MVP Freddie Freeman playing first base. Freeman takes over four hours to get game ready. He\u2019s so hobbled, he\u2019s yet to register an extra base hit during these playoffs, very un-Freeman to say the least! The rosters The 26-man rosters featured some changes to both teams. Infielder John Berti was left off the Yankees roster after getting some time at first base this postseason. In his place is Nestor Cortes, an all-star staring pitcher who has been sidelined since September 25th with a elbow injury thought to be season ending. Should it go wrong for the 29-year-old, he could find himself sidelined next season, but he\u2019s \u201call in for the chip.\u201d Cortes will be a valuable lefty in the bullpen, having gone through rehab and passed a fitness test of a 29-pitch simulated game. New York will have 13 pitchers and 13 position players on their roster. LA also have the 13-13 split. they\u2019ve lost a reliable bullpen arm in Evan Phillips, a righty that may have been used v Aaron Judge in late-inning play. Instead the Dodgers added another right handed reliever, Brusdar Graterol, and lefty fireman Alex Vesia. Kevin Kiermaier will sit. Yesterday and today There\u2019s been piles of pixels dedicated to the Fall Classic history between these two teams, the first one to take place without iconic baseball broadcaster, Vin Scully, who retired in 2016 after 67 seasons as the voice of the Dodgers. This is what the intro to Game 1 back in 1963 when the two teams played their first series since the Dodgers moved from Brooklyn to LA following the 1957 season. The Umps As you can imagine, with the World Series being MLB\u2019s crown jewel event, the league has made sure only the highest ranked umpires would be making the calls. Except, according to Umpire Auditor on \u201cX\u201d, this is not the case at all. Quite the contrary! Well you know what they say: you can\u2019t argue with logic! Good evening, morning and afternoon to you and welcome to our live coverage of Game 1 of Major League Baseball\u2019s 120th World Series. In case you haven\u2019t heard, it\u2019s the Dodgers and the Yankees bidding for the oversized heavy and expensive jewellery, something they\u2019ve done 11 times prior: seven times via Bronx/Brooklyn NYC subway and four times via continental jet. It\u2019s the first time since they\u2019ve met in the Fall Classic since the Dodgers beat the Yanks in 1981. Both clubs are under enormous pressure to win a World Series title. The Dodgers won in the Covid-19 season of 2020 which, let\u2019s be honest, few take seriously. The Yankees are in their first World Series since 2009, the longest such gap in appearances since the franchise\u2019s founding in 1903. Babe Ruth helped the New York Americans into their first Fall Classic in 1921 v the Giants \u2013 a series played in Manhattan\u2019s Polo Grounds, not in the yet to be built big ballpark in the Bronx. Who has more pressure to win? Personally, I think since Yankees ownership has morphed into accountants under Hal Steinbrenner, son of the less patient George, it\u2019s the Dodgers that need to win this series more. New York just seem happy to be there, which is un-Yankee like to say the least. Both of these teams are loaded with star sluggers and strong bullpens, but the high-profile, overpowering starting pitcher that teams fear facing are notably absent. Gerrit Cole, the solid but not currently spectacular Yankees ace has been inconsistent in a season shortened by elbow inflammation experienced this spring. He\u2019ll start for New York tonight in Game 1. The Dodgers best arm, Yoshinobu Yamamoto has also had his issues, but can hardly complain about his first season in MLB after arriving from Japan this spring. He\u2019ll pitch in Game 2 tomorrow. Tonight LA sends Jack Flaherty to the hill. Acquired from Detroit at the trade deadline, he\u2019s been a reliable arm for the Dodgers, although the Mets roughed him up in Game 5 of the NLCS, after he shut New York down in Game 1. There\u2019s some pomp and circumstance before first pitch, which is scheduled for 17:08 LA time. Team introductions and the my traditional national anthem are yet to come. So sit back, relax pop some corn and grab a bevy. Oh, and if you want to see your name (or handle) in the paper, you can get me via tweet @LengelDavid or via email. Do it: I\u2019ll make you famous. More to come: stick with us! David will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s a look at the Guardian\u2019s predictions for this year\u2019s Fall Classic.",

Here are the major developments from today: In Houston, Kamala Harris was joined onstage by superstar singer Beyonc\u00e9, congressman Colin Allred, musician Willie Nelson, actress Jessica Alba, several Texas-based OB-GYNs and families impacted by the state\u2019s abortion ban in what her campaign is calling their largest rally to date. Harris focused her remarks on the state\u2019s abortion ban, which sparked a slew of abortion restrictions nationwide, and was joined on stage by Amanda and Josh Zurawski, a Texas couple who sued the state after Amanda was unable to access treatment for a life-threatening pregnancy complication. Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Traverse City, Michigan was delayed several hours after the ex-president\u2019s interview with podcast host Joe Rogan lasted three hours. Trump Harris and Trump are tied at 48% each for the popular vote for the US presidential election, according to the final New York Times/Siena College national poll published on today. Chinese hackers have targeted phones used by Donald Trump and JD Vance, the New York Times reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. According to the sources, investigators are trying to determine what communication data may have been taken or observed. On Friday, Joe Biden formally apologized for the United States government\u2019s role in running at least 523 Indian boarding schools. His remarks were given at the Gila Crossing community school outside Phoenix, Arizona, and marked his first visit to Indian Country as president. The Washington Post declined to endorse a presidential candidate for the first time since the 1980s. Senior Democratic figure Susan Rice, who was US ambassador to the United Nations and national security adviser under Barack Obama and then director of the US domestic policy council under Joe Biden, made a blistering post on X about the Washington Post. \u201cSo much for \u2018Democracy Dies in Darkness\u2019,\u201d she said, referring to the newspaper\u2019s slogan. Two Senate Democrats have written a letter urging the justice department to investigate, and if necessary prosecute, Elon Musk over his potentially illegal $1m giveaway for registered voters. And another top Democrat is calling for an investigation into Musk for the tech billionaire\u2019s ties to Russia. During his rally in Scranton tonight, Tim Walz took a moment to express his appreciation for Joe Biden, who was born in the Pennsylvania city and remains a popular figure there. \u201cThis country owes a huge debt to you and a huge debt to Joe Biden,\u201d Walz said. Harris raised $97m in the first half of October, compared with Trump\u2019s $16m, according to reports filed with the Federal Election commission. In an appearance on the Cats &amp; Cosby podcast, a conservative talk radio show, Donald Trump said special counsel Jack Smith should be deported. Trump made news yesterday when he said he would fire Smith, the justice department official who is prosecuting him for allegedly plotting to overturn the 2020 election and hide classified documents, \u201cwithin two seconds\u201d of becoming president. Harris has concluded her rally in Houston, calling on voters to cast their ballots in the next 11 days. \u201cDo we trust women? Do we believe in reproductive freedom? Do we believe in the promise of America, and are we ready to fight for it?\u201d Harris said, before concluding, \u201cAnd when we fight, we win.\u201d \u201cWe know weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning,\u201d Harris says, quoting Psalm 30:5 and encouraging voters to get out to the polls before 5 November. Speaking to Gen Z voters in the audience, Harris says that she \u201csees your power\u201d. \u201cIt ain\u2019t right that you may have fewer rights than your mother or your grandmother,\u201d Harris said, before asking the crowd: \u201cCan we applaud our leaders who are voting for the first time?\u201d Seeking to cast herself in contrast to Donald Trump, Harris said she will restore reproductive freedom if elected president. \u201cWhen Congress passes the bill to restore reproductive freedom, I will proudly sign it into law,\u201d Harris said. \u201cSince Roe was overturned, every time reproductive freedom has been on the ballot, from Kansas to California to Kentucky and Michigan, Montana, Vermont and Ohio, the people of America have voted for freedom.\u201d Harris is continuing, speaking about the stakes of the supreme court if Trump is re-elected. \u201cAnd now the attorney general of Texas is suing the United States government so that Texas prosecutors can get their hands on private medical records of women who leave the state to get care,\u201d Harris said. \u201cOn the one hand, Donald Trump won\u2019t let anyone see his medical records. I gave up mine. And on the other hand, they want to get their hands on your medical records. \u201cLet us be clear, if Donald Trump wins again, he will ban abortion nationwide,\u201d Harris said. \u201cNo one is protected if there is a Trump national abortion ban. \u201cIf Donald Trump is president again, he will likely get to appoint at least one justice\u201d to the Supreme court, Harris said. \u201cAt which point Donald Trump will have packed the court with five out of nine justices.\u201d Kamala Harris is continuing to excoriate Donald Trump, sharing the stories of women who\u2019ve been denied healthcare since Roe was overturned. \u201cTexas, what is happening across this state, in our country, is a health care crisis. And Donald Trump is the architect of it,\u201d Harris said. She went on to share the story of Ryan Hamilton, who found his wife alone and bleeding after being denied care for a miscarriage. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, men across America, this needs to be said, men across America do not want to see their sisters and mothers put at risk because their rights have been taken.\u201d Kamala Harris has just shared the story of Kate Cox, a Texas woman who was denied emergency abortion care by the Texas Supreme Court, and is introducing Shanette Williams, the mother of Amber Nicole Thurman. \u201cAmber Nicole Thurman, I promised her mother, I would speak her name, a vibrant 28 year old mother of a six year old son who died of preventive death because of Georgia\u2019s abortion ban,\u201d Harris said. Harris has continued, denouncing Republican leaders who have neglected maternal and infant healthcare while denying abortion care across the US. \u201cFor decades, these extremist leaders, who have neglected prenatal care, maternity care and postpartum care, and who now continuously failing support women and children, claim to care of women and children. I have a question for them, where you been?\u201d Harris said. \u201cWhere have you been when it comes to helping pregnant women and new mothers? Where have you been when it comes to affordable child care?\u201d \u201cThe hypocrisy abounds,\u201d she said, before showing a video combining testimony of families who\u2019ve suffered under abortion bans alongside Donald Trump saying he did \u201ca great thing\u201d by appointing the Supreme court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade. Speaking onstage at her rally in Houston, Kamala Harris is making a powerful call for reproductive rights. \u201cYou are ground zero in the fight for reproductive freedom,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know what\u2019s happening here in Texas, doctors and nurses could go to prison for life simply for providing reproductive care.\u201d \u201cTexas has a law now that offers a cash bounty for turning in someone who merely helps a friend or a family member get the care they need,\u201d Harris added. \u201cIn some counties in Texas, they have passed travel bans to prevent women from going to other states to receive care.\u201d \u201cWhen Donald Trump was president, he hand selected the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v Wade, and as he intended, they did. And now more than 20 states have a Trump abortion ban.\u201d \u201cNow, one in three American women live in a state with a Trump abortion ban,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd let us agree, one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply help to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 has welcomed Kamala Harris on stage, with her song Freedom playing in the background. \u201cIt\u2019s time to sing a new song,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 said. \u201cOur generations of loved ones before us are whispering a prophecy, a quest, a calling, an anthem, our moment right now. It\u2019s time for America to sing a new song.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 and Kelly Rowland are speaking onstage at the Harris rally in Houston. \u201cWe are grabbing back the pen to write a new American story, a story of community, of equality, strength, of kindness and of hope,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cWhen I was a little girl and I pledged allegiance to the United States of America, that flag meant something to me, and today that means grabbing that pen and casting my vote as I already did two days ago, for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not here as a celebrity. I\u2019m not here as a politician. I\u2019m here as a mother,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 said. \u201cImagine our daughters growing up seeing what\u2019s possible with no ceilings, no limitations.\u201d \u201cYour voice has power and magnitude. Your vote is one of the most valuable tools. And we need you. Your freedom is your God given right, your human right,\u201d she added. Tina Knowles, an American businesswoman, fashion designer and mother of Beyonc\u00e9, is speaking now at Harris\u2019 rally in Houston. \u201cI\u2019ve been so blessed to have many careers, many Black jobs,\u201d Knowles opened, referencing Donald Trump\u2019s statement that immigrants are going to take so-called \u201cBlack jobs\u201d from Black Americans. \u201cThe best job that I\u2019ve ever had is being a mother.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so proud to be here with two of my daughters,\u201d Knowles said, before welcoming her daughter Beyonc\u00e9 and good friend Kelly Rowland. After a long intermission, Ondrea Cummings has begun speaking at the Harris rally in Houston. Cummings, a resident of San Antonio, is featured in a new ad that the Harris campaign released earlier this week, telling her story of nearly dying after a pregnancy complication. \u201cIn the fall of 2022, after many prayers, my husband and I found out that we were expecting. Everything changed when my one evening far too early into my pregnancy, after going to the ER and my OB GYN, and learning that my pregnancy was not viable, I was given no options. Despite being at high risk for infection because of Texas extreme laws, I was told I had to wait, which I did in the hospital for days,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cMy baby girl, Emery J, was born five days after my water broke. She lived only for a few minutes, but I hold my baby close to my heart,\u201d she said, describing how she developed a severe infection that left her hospitalized for three weeks afterward. \u201cToday is the first time I\u2019m sharing my story. It\u2019s taken many months of physical and emotional healing to get where I am today,\u201d Cummins said. \u201cTexas abortion bans unleashed by Donald Trump almost cost me my life,\u201d she added before noting that Black and brown womens\u2019 pain is often ignored. The Harris campaign reports that 30,000 people are at her Houston rally tonight, the largest crowd to date for her campaign. Follow along here: Colin Allred, the Democratic congressman running to unseat Texas senator Ted Cruz, is speaking at Kamala Harris\u2019 rally in Texas, denouncing his opponent and recalling his experience in Congress on January 6. \u201cI believe in a very different Texas than Ted Cruz does,\u201d Allred said. \u201cMy time in Congress, I\u2019ve been the exact opposite of Ted Cruz, because I never forgot where I came from, never forgot the folks who gave me a chance. I\u2019ve been the most bipartisan Texan in Congress, because that\u2019s how you get things done.\u201d \u201cTed Cruz is too small for Texas,\u201d Allred said, recalling how Cruz took refuge in a supply closet during the January 6 attack on the Capitol while Allred prepared to defend his colleagues, using the strength he says he built as an NFL linebacker, and how Cruz fled the state during a deadly winter storm. He went on to lead the crowd in a chant of \u201cYou gotta lose your job.\u201d Amanda and Josh Zurawski, a Texas couple who sued the state after Amanda was unable to access treatment for a life-threatening pregnancy complication, are speaking now at Kamala Harris\u2019 rally in Houston. \u201cAfter 18 months of grueling fertility treatments in the spring of 2022 we were thrilled to find out that she was pregnant with our first baby, a girl. We were over the moon,\u201d Josh said. \u201cMy first trimester was smooth sailing, but suddenly at 18 weeks, I suffered complications we were, with 100% certainty going to lose our baby girl. We were devastated. What I needed at that point was an abortion so that I could safely and with dignity, deliver our daughter and begin the healing process,\u201d Amanda added. \u201cBut this was Post Roe Texas, the near total abortion ban had gone into effect just two days after Amanda\u2019s water broke, ending the pregnancy would have been illegal abortion under the Texas ban, our doctor risked losing her license and even face jail time,\u201d Josh continued. \u201cEventually, Amanda\u2019s temperature spiked. She was shaking and disoriented. We rushed to the emergency room, and by this time, Amanda had developed an infection, which had become septic.\u201d \u201cI was finally close enough to death to deserve health care in Texas,\u201d Amanda said. \u201cIt is unthinkable to me that anyone could cheer on the cruel abortion bans that nearly took Amanda\u2019s life, but that\u2019s exactly what Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have done,\u201d Josh said. \u201cThe decision about if and when to start a family should be ours to make. Not Donald Trump\u2019s, not Ted Cruz\u2019s. That\u2019s why we need to elect vice president Harris, representative Colin Allred and Democrats up and down the ballot to restore our reproductive freedom.\u201d Lifelong Texan and beloved musician Willie Nelson is on stage at the rally performing Mammas Don\u2019t Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys and On the Road Again. The 91-year-old Texan wore his signature braids and red bandana as he performed on stage with a band. Yesenia Gamez Gamboa, a Tucson-area immigration lawyer, is sharing her experience healing from an ectopic pregnancy and pursuing IVF in order to conceive a family with her husband. \u201cAccess to a safe and quick abortion was what saved my life and preserved my fertility and now those very same protections are gone,\u201d she said, on stage at Kamala Harris\u2019 Houston rally. \u201cI trust women to make decisions over their own bodies, and I trust Texas Women to tell men like Ted Cruz. JD Vance and Donald Trump that they are done, their turn is over.\u201d Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign is playing another ad between speakers at its Houston rally. This one features a woman who recalls being impregnated by her abusive stepfather at the age of 12. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do. I was a child. I didn\u2019t know what it meant to be pregnant at all. But I had options,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause Donald Trump overturned Roe v Wade, girls and women all over the country have lost the right to choose, even for rape or incest. Donald Trump did this. He took away our freedom.\u201d Todd Ivey, a Houston-based OB-GYN, is speaking now at Kamala Harris\u2019 rally in Texas, and is joined on stage with several colleagues in their white coats. \u201cToday in Texas, because of Donald Trump, I could be thrown in prison for life for providing reproductive health care,\u201d Ivey said. \u201cAs a result, many of my patients with tragic pregnancy complications have been forced to flee up to get the health care that they need and that they deserve.\u201d \u201cNearly 7 in 10 OB-GYNs say that abortion bans have worsened their ability to manage pregnancy related emergencies, and here in Texas, three and four OBGYNs have said they simply can no longer practice evidence based medicine,\u201d he added. \u201cTens of thousands of Texas women traveled out of state for abortion care last year, leaving their jobs, leaving their homes and leaving their families just to get medical care.\u201d \u201cI was shocked when Roe was overturned, but I\u2019ve never been more shocked to hear Donald Trump continue to brag about them,\u201d Ivey said. \u201cSo let me be clear about one thing, there is no place for Donald Trump in my exam room.\u201d Between speakers at Kamala Harris\u2019 rally in Houston, the campaign briefly displayed an ad featuring the family of Amber Nicole Thurman, a Georgia woman who died because of the state\u2019s abortion ban. \u201cThis is the result of what happens when you try to control a woman\u2019s body. My daughter is gone because of what Donald Trump did. She would be here had they helped her,\u201d Thurman\u2019s mother, Shanette Williams, said in the video. Kamala Harris\u2019s rally in Houston has gotten under way this evening, with actor Jessica Alba kicking off the event. \u201cIt was here in Texas that I learned the importance of looking out for your neighbors, lending a hand without hesitation and treating people the way you would want to be treated,\u201d Alba said, noting that she spent a portion of her childhood living in Del Rio, Texas. \u201cAs a woman, I know we need a leader like Kamala Harris who is dedicated to protecting reproductive freedom,\u201d she added, also noting her support for Harris\u2019s proposed child tax credit. \u201cSo let\u2019s hear it Houston, We are not going back,\u201d Alba concluded. Leonard Sanchez is attending the Harris rally with other members of his Local UFCW455, which represents grocery and retail workers in southern Texas and Louisiana. Being a long-time Democrat in a perennially red state can be \u201crough,\u201d he conceded. But he hopes Harris\u2019s star-studded event in the final stretch of the campaign jolt apathetic voters in the state, who feel their vote matters. But he said so much is on the line, especially in Texas, which has a near-total ban on abortion. While Sanchez is supportive of Harris, he also fears a return of \u201cthe other guy\u201d to the White House. \u201cHe\u2019s too anti-immigrant,\u201d he said, adding that Trump was not a real ally of labor. Sanchez said he is baffled by union members who are abandoning Democrats for Republicans, especially in a right-to-work state like Texas. He is hopeful Harris will take on big corporations and fight for better wages, but progress will also depend on changing the state\u2019s politics. \u201cEvery year we get a little bit closer and closer,\u201d Sanchez said. Among the crowd at the Harris rally in Houston, many said they waited for hours to get in, as temperatures climbed to 90F, just shy of a record for late October. Sara Gonzales, 32, of Splendora, Texas, rearranged her work schedule and drove to the stadium as soon as she finished her early-morning shift at Starbucks. Gonzales said she was an independent and and wrote-in a candidate for president in 2020. But the political stakes changed when the Supreme Court overturned Roe, and Texas enacted a near-total ban on abortion. \u201cBeing a woman in Texas right now, it\u2019s not ok. I should have freedom over my own body,\u201d she said. She views Harris as a protector of hard-fought \u201cfreedoms\u201d from abortion access to LGBTQ+ rights. Seated in the front row behind the stage, Tiffany Hiza, 48, and her mother Joyce Hiza, 80, wore green shirts touting their Jamaican ancestry, which they\u2019re proud to share with Harris. Being a Democrat in Texas can feel like \u201cswimming against the tide,\u201d Tiffany Hiza said. She and her mother voted on the first day of early voting this week for Harris, a poignant moment for her mother, who had come to fear she might never see a woman president after Hillary Clinton lost in 2016. In the final stretch, they\u2019ve tuned out the polls and the analysis. Both said they feel sanguine about Harris\u2019s chances. Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Traverse City, Michigan \u2013 originally scheduled for 7:30pm ET \u2013 has been postponed several hours following the ex-president\u2019s interview with podcast host Joe Rogan. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung posted on X that the former president\u2019s interview lasted three hours, delaying his departure from Austin. \u201cWe\u2019re coming now, Michigan!\u201d Cheung wrote. He posted the message at 7:19 pm ET. The Upper Michigan Source reported that Trump is now expected to arrive in the state around 10:30pm ET. During his rally in Scranton tonight, Tim Walz took a moment to express his appreciation for Joe Biden, who was born in the Pennsylvania city and remains a popular figure there. \u201cThis country owes a huge debt to you and a huge debt to Joe Biden,\u201d Walz said. \u201c[Presidents] have always put this country above themselves, no matter the cost to their personal ambitions or what happened to them. Joe Biden has secured his place in history by upholding that tradition.\u201d The Scranton crowd erupted into cheers of \u201cJoe!\u201d as Walz spoke. Michael McNulty, a 47-year-old voter from Scranton, lives down the street from Biden\u2019s childhood home and expressed gratitude for the president but said he felt invigorated by the Harris-Walz ticket. \u201cI think there\u2019s a real sense of optimism and hope here. It\u2019s not just against Trump,\u201d McNulty, wearing a Harris-Walz camo hat, said after the Scranton rally. \u201cThey\u2019re sharing a vision for the future of the country that is one I want to live in. It\u2019s one that I want to raise my children in and that I\u2019m really proud to go out and contribute to make happen.\u201d Biden won Pennsylvania by 1.2 points in 2020, four years after Trump carried the state by 0.7 points. Although polls show a tied race, McNulty is confident that Harris will win the Keystone State this time around. \u201cWe\u2019re going to push this over the finish line here for the Harris-Walz ticket,\u201d he said. \u201cPA is going to deliver, and we\u2019re going to have Madame President.\u201d Thousands of fans waited for hours to attend Kamala Harris\u2019s event in Houston. Inside Shell Energy stadium, the crowd buzzed in anticipation of a performance by Beyonc\u00e9 in her native Houston. Lots of cowboy boots and cowboy hats. Some wore shirts that said \u201cMy president is a Black Woman\u201d. One man wore a sequined white blazer over a \u201ccomma la\u201d T-shirt. It\u2019s been decades since a Democratic presidential nominee stopped in the Lone Star state this close to Election Day and the Democrats here are ecstatic to be on the receiving end of some political love. The DJ just encouraged the crowd to let loose. \u201cIt\u2019s your American right,\u201d he said. The fifth circuit court of appeals ruled today that Mississippi violated federal law by counting mail ballots that are postmarked by election day, but arrive after that. The ruling, which was issued by a panel of three judges, does not require the state to make any changes before the election. The court\u2019s decision is a victory for the Republican National Committee, which brought the lawsuit, and a loss for Democrats and voting rights advocates, who worry the case will impact other states. Although the court\u2019s ruling is only binding in three states under the fifth circuit\u2019s jurisdiction (and not in effect for the current election), Democrats fear the decision could impact the outcome of elections in other states that allow ballots to be counted after election day \u2013 such as Nevada, Ohio, Virginia and Maryland \u2013 especially if the election is contested. Eight Washington Post columnists have issued a response to their paper\u2019s decision not to endorse a presidential candidate. \u201cAn independent newspaper might someday choose to back away from making presidential endorsements. But this isn\u2019t the right moment, when one candidate is advocating positions that directly threaten freedom of the press and the values of the Constitution,\u201d they write. The letter\u2019s signatories include Perry Bacon Jr, EJ Dionne Jr, David Ignatius, Ruth Marcus, Dana Milbank, Eugene Robinson, Jennifer Rubin and Karen Tumulty. A San Antonio election clerk was assaulted at a polling site yesterday \u2013 in what is believed to be the first instance of violence against an election worker this fall, The Texas Tribune reports. The suspect has been arrested on suspicion of injury to an elderly person, a felony. According to a Bexar County sheriff\u2019s report, the suspect, 63-year-old Jesse Lutzenberger, entered the polling location wearing a Make America Great Again hat. Displaying political slogans in polling sites is considered electioneering. The poll worker asked Lutzenberger to remove his hat and Lutzenberger proceeded to vote, but put the hat back on after. As the poll worker escorted Lutzenberger out of the building (after he cast his ballot), Sheriff Javier Salazar said a surveillance video showed Lutzenberger throw \u201cseveral punches right at the face of the victim.\u201d The poll worker received emergency medical treatment and Lutzenberger was booked into jail before being released on a $30,000 bond today. \u201cThis has been an especially contentious elections cycle,\u201d Salazar said at a Friday briefing. \u201cWe\u2019ve had several incidents where people show up wearing inappropriate clothing,\u201d that qualifies as electioneering. Tim Walz is currently campaigning in Joe Biden\u2019s hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania. The vice presidential nominee has praised Biden, saying \u201cThis country owes a huge debt to you and a huge debt to Joe Biden.\u201d Current Guardian polling shows Harris leading Trump by less than a point in the crucial swing state. Meanwhile, former president Barack Obama is in North Carolina campaigning for Kamala Harris. The Democratic Party has not won the swing state since 2008, when Obama was elected president. Our polling shows Harris trailing Trump by two points in the Tar Heel state. Another top Democrat is calling for an investigation into Elon Musk \u2013 this time for the tech billionaire\u2019s ties to Russia. Rep. Adam Smith, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, has called for the defense department to investigate a report that Musk has been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Politico reports. \u201cWe should investigate what Elon Musk is up to to make sure that it is not to the detriment of the national security of the United States,\u201d Smith said. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Armed Services Committee, echoed Smith. \u201cElon Musk\u2014who has billions in contracts that support some of our most sensitive military operations\u2014reportedly has an open line to Putin,\u201d Shaheen said. Musk\u2019s spacecraft company SpaceX has multiple contracts with the defense department and NASA. According to a Wall Street Journal report published yesterday, the billionaire has had previously unreported discussions with Putin since 2022. Musk has been one of Donald Trump\u2019s greatest supporters this election cycle, donating $118m to his pro-Trump super Pac. Trumphas long been a vocal admirer of Putin\u2019s. After concluding his remarks in Austin this afternoon, Donald Trump spoke with executives from Blue Origin, the aerospace company owned by Jeff Bezos. Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, also owns the Washington Post, which announced today that it wouldn\u2019t endorse a candidate for president. The Washington Post Guild, the union that represents many of the paper\u2019s staffers, said that according to the paper\u2019s reporters and Guild members, the endorsement for Harris was already drafted and the decision not to publish was made by Bezos himself. According to the Associated Press, Trump spoke briefly with Blue Origin\u2019s CEO, David Limp, and vice-president of government relations, Megan Mitchell, as he left a hangar where he spoke to supporters and journalists at the Austin airport. Here\u2019s more from the Guardian\u2019s Anna Betts: Although Donald Trump refused to appear in a CNN townhall alongside Kamala Harrris this week, his running mate JD Vance will appear on the network this weekend. The vice presidential nominee will appear on CNN\u2019s State of the Union with Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, alongside former Wyoming congresswoman Liz Cheney, a longtime Republican who has endorsed Harris. Kamala Harris is expected to discuss the \u201cfundamental fight for the freedom of women to make decisions about their own body\u201d at her Houston rally this evening. She\u2019ll appear alongside families that have been affected by abortion bans like Texas\u2019 \u2013 including Amanda and Josh Zurawski, a Texas couple who sued the state after Amanda was unable to access treatment for a life-threatening pregnancy complication, and Shanette Williams, the mother of Amber Nicole Thurman, a Georgia mother who died from an infection she feared seeking treatment for under the state\u2019s restrictive laws. \u201cSadly, the elected leaders of Texas, a lot of them, have made Texas ground zero in this fundamental fight for the freedom of women to make decisions about their own body,\u201d Harris told reporters earlier today. \u201cThis is not just some theoretical concept. Real harm has occurred in our country, a real suffering has occurred. People have died.\u201d At a rally in Austin earlier today, Donald Trump said Harris was only campaigning in Texas in order to \u201crub shoulders with woke celebrities.\u201d Excerpts of Harris\u2019 prepared remarks show that the vice-president also intends to criticize Texas attorney general Ken Paxton (who sued the federal government \u201cso that Texas prosecutors can get their hands on the private medical records of women who leave the state to get care\u201d) and Trump (\u201cDonald Trump won\u2019t let anyone see his medical records. But these guys want to get their hands on yours?\u201d). Harris is also expected to argue that no state will be safe if Trump is re-elected and imposes a nationwide abortion ban \u2013 a policy Trump has fluctuated on despite nominating three of the conservative supreme court justices who ruled to overturn Roe v Wade. \u201cWhat happens in this election will determine the future of reproductive freedom for generations to come,\u201d Harris is expected to say. Two Senate Democrats have written a letter urging the justice department to investigate, and if necessary prosecute, Elon Musk over his potentially illegal $1m giveaway for registered voters. On Wednesday, the justice department sent a letter to Musk\u2019s America Super Pac warning that a $1m-a-day sweepstake the billionaire and Tesla CEO began last week may violate federal elections law. Despite the warning, Musk has continued the giveaway, naming two winners yesterday. In their letter to the attorney general, Merrick Garland, Vermont senator Peter Welch and Connecticut senator Richard Blumenthal urge that the justice department to hold Musk accountable: \u201cPermitting this scheme to proceed without consequences makes a mockery of democracy and the law,\u201d the senators wrote in a letter first obtained by CNN. \u201cWe urge you to investigate whether Elon Musk\u2019s cash prizes are prohibited payments for voter registration and take appropriate enforcement action, including prosecution, if his actions prove to be illegal.\u201d Musk, who has endorsed Trump, has donated more than $118m to his pro-Trump political action committee and has recently begun campaigning for the ex-president in person. Kamala Harris\u2019s rally this evening with superstar singer Beyonc\u00e9 will be far from her last appearance alongside a celebrity musician. On Monday, Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, will campaign in Ann Arbor, Michigan, with singer-songwriter Maggie Rogers. Then, on Wednesday, Harris will rally voters at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, alongside performances by Mumford &amp; Sons, two members of the band the National, Gracie Abrams and Remi Wolf. The performances come in the final days of a high-stakes election season, as both Democrats and Republicans urge voters to get out to the polls. In an appearance on the Cats &amp; Cosby podcast, a conservative talk radio show, Donald Trump said special counsel Jack Smith should be deported. Trump made news yesterday when he said he would fire Smith, the justice department official who is prosecuting him for allegedly plotting to overturn the 2020 election and hide classified documents, \u201cwithin two seconds\u201d of becoming president. The Guardian\u2019s Hugo Lowell has more: Thirteen \u201clifelong Republican\u201d former Trump administration staffers released a letter today echoing former Trump chief of staff John Kelly\u2019s warnings about the ex-president\u2019s authoritarian tendencies. Here\u2019s Joanna Walters with more: A fresh group of \u201clifelong Republican\u201d former aides to Donald Trump added their voices on Friday to the chorus of criticism of the Republican nominee\u2019s character and fitness for the White House, speaking out in support of John Kelly, who earlier this week called his old boss a fascist. \u201cThe revelations General Kelly brought forward are disturbing and shocking. But because we know Trump and have worked for and alongside him, we were sadly not surprised by what General Kelly had to say,\u201d a letter from more than a dozen staffers who worked in Trump\u2019s administration says, as first reported by Politico. Here\u2019s a look at where things stand: Chinese hackers have targeted phones used by Donald Trump and JD Vance, the New York Times reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. According to the sources, investigators are trying to determine what communication data may have been taken or observed. On Friday, Joe Biden formally apologized for the United States government\u2019s role in running at least 523 Indian boarding schools. His remarks were given at the Gila Crossing community school outside Phoenix, Arizona, and marked his first visit to Indian Country as president. The new publisher of the Washington Post, controversial British journalist Will Lewis, squashed the paper\u2019s plans to endorse Kamala Harris for the White House in this election, according to a report. The Columbia Journalism Review has just published an article saying that senior figures at the Post had been preparing to publish the announcement that the Post was endorsing Harris, the Democratic nominee for president \u2013 but there were delays. Senior Democratic figure Susan Rice, who was US ambassador to the United Nations and national security adviser under Barack Obama and then director of the US domestic policy council under Joe Biden, has made a blistering post on X about the Washington Post. \u201cSo much for \u2018Democracy Dies in Darkness\u2019,\u201d she said, referring to the newspaper\u2019s slogan. Joe Biden has formally apologized for the US government\u2019s role in running more than 500 Indian boarding schools. The Guardian\u2019s Adria R Walker reports: On Friday, Joe Biden formally apologized for the United States government\u2019s role in running at least 523 Indian boarding schools. His remarks were given at the Gila Crossing community school outside Phoenix, Arizona, and marked his first visit to Indian Country as president. \u201cAfter 150 years, the United States government eventually stopped the program,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut the federal government has never, never formally apologized for what happened \u2013 until today. I formally apologize, as president of the United States of America, for what we did. I formally apologize. That\u2019s long overdue.\u201d \u201cFederal Indian boarding school policy, the pain it has caused, will always be a significant mark of shame, a blot on American history,\u201d he said. \u201cFor too long, this all happened with virtually no public attention.\u201d For the full story, click here: Chinese hackers have targeted phones used by Donald Trump and JD Vance, the New York Times reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. According to the sources, investigators are trying to determine what communication data may have been taken or observed. They added that Trump\u2019s and Vance\u2019s teams have been alerted this week and that the two men were \u201camong a number of people inside and outside the government whose phone numbers had been targeted through the infiltration of Verizon phone systems\u201d, the New York Times reports. It added that Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung did not directly address whether the phones used by Trump and Vance have been targeted. The outlet did however report that Cheung blamed the Biden-Harris administration for allowing a foreign adversary to target the campaign. In August, the FBI said that Iranian hackers targeted the Trump campaign and sent documents to the Biden campaign. Iran\u2019s efforts include \u201cthefts and disclosures\u201d and \u201care intended to influence the US election process\u201d, a joint statement by the FBI, the office of the director of national intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said at the time. Joining Donald Trump on stage was Alexis Nungaray, the mother of 12-year old Jocelyn, who was murdered earlier this summer. The people accused of killing Jocelyn are Franklin Pena and Johan Jose Martinez Rangel, two undocumented men from Venezuela. Addressing the crowd, Nungaray said: She was just being a child and due to the Biden-Harris policies we have here are why she\u2019s not here any more. She was taken from her vulnerability and they made her a target, and ran with that and now I will for ever be a grieving mother and my son will for ever be a grieving brother who will no longer get to grow up with his sister. Kamala Harris has never reached out to me, just even as a human to give her condolences as a humane person running this country. I think it\u2019s very sad that she can\u2019t even just give me an open apology, sincere apology. She\u2019s attempted to apologize to me just days before this election. I find it very inconvenient and convenient for her. I appreciate everything Donald Trump and Senator Ted Cruz have done for me. They\u2019ve been a tremendous amount of help for me and my family during this incredibly hard, hard journey. Donald Trump has taken the stage at a campaign rally in Austin, Texas. Addressing the latest decision from a federal judge that Virginia must restore voter eligibility to more than 1,600 people after their eligibility was illegally removed, Trump said: The outrageous decision goes against the very bedrock of our democracy. Trump, who has also falsely claimed that the 2020 election was stolen from him, called the decision \u201cblatantly non-American, it\u2019s election interference\u201d, and went on to baselessly accuse Kamala Harris of being \u201cbehind it\u201d. Kamala Harris is talking to reporters in Houston, in one of her new, impromptu quick comments on camera at short notice and willingness to take questions on the hop. She has just criticized Donald Trump for his comments on the campaign trail last night when he called the country a \u201cgarbage can\u201d because of immigration policies under the Biden administration. \u201cIt\u2019s just another example of how he really belittles our country,\u201d Harris said. The Democratic nominee for president is standing against a backdrop of American flags, shortly after arriving in Houston, Texas, which, despite being a strongly Republican-voting state, is a place her campaign thinks is a powerful springboard for a national message. Harris is appearing with Beyonc\u00e9 and Willy Nelson tonight. Harris continued on about Trump, the Republican nominee, about him enjoying a bully pulpit. \u201cAnd this is how he uses it? To tell the rest of the world that the United States is trash?\u201d she said. She said it was not how the president of the United States should behave. Asked whether she has voted yet, she said no, not yet. Asked if she could get pro-choice legislation through Congress to restore the rights of Roe v Wade \u2013 taken away by a US supreme court stacked by Trump to the right \u2013 she pointed out, revealingly, that if Democratic candidate Colin Allred can unseat GOP Senator Ted Cruz in Texas, it will boost her party\u2019s hopes of keeping control of the US Senate, which is crucial to pass legislation. The new publisher of the Washington Post, controversial British journalist Will Lewis, squashed the paper\u2019s plans to endorse Kamala Harris for the White House in this election, according to a report. The Columbia Journalism Review has just published an article saying that senior figures at the Post, including in the opinion section and on the board, had been preparing to publish the announcement that the Post was endorsing Harris, the Democratic nominee for president \u2013 but there were delays. Then earlier today, the publication announced it would not endorse either Harris or her Republican rival Donald Trump \u2013 and that the plan to back Harris had been reversed by Lewis. It quoted a democracy expert, Ian Bassin, from a previous CJR article calling the decision by the Post \u2013 and also this week by the Los Angeles Times, which is also owned by a billionaire \u2013 not to endorse \u201canticipatory obedience\u201d in trying to appease Donald Trump in case he wins. Trump has called the mainstream media \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d. Senior Democratic figure Susan Rice, who was US ambassador to the United Nations and national security adviser under Barack Obama and then director of the US domestic policy council under Joe Biden, has made a blistering post on X about the Washington Post. \u201cSo much for \u2018Democracy Dies in Darkness\u2019,\u201d she said, referring to the newspaper\u2019s slogan. She continued: \u201cThis is the most hypocritical, chicken shit move from a publication that is supposed to hold people in power to account.\u201d There is welling disquiet over the Washington Post\u2019s announcement that it will decline to endorse either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump in this election. A former long-serving senior editor from the paper called it \u201cappalling\u201d, especially \u201cgiven the choice this year\u201d. Robert McCartney has previously speculated that the Post would endorse Harris and also had heard on the grapevine that they would dodge. Here\u2019s his reaction on X now: McCartney had posted yesterday: \u201cThere\u2019s speculation in newsroom that owner Jeff Bezos may want to avoid risk of endangering Amazon\u2019s government contracts if Trump wins.\u201d Publisher Will Lewis was a controversial choice by Bezos at the Post, which the Amazon mogul owns. A British police special enquiry team is examining allegations that Lewis presided over the deliberate destruction of emails at Rupert Murdoch\u2019s UK newspaper business when he worked for the company 13 years ago. Sally Buzbee, the editor who took over from Marty Baron, was forced out last year in a move instigated by Lewis, who wanted to replace her with fellow Brit Robert Winnett, but he shortly after backed out amid uproar at the Post. Marty Baron, the distinguished former editor of the Washington Post, has excoriated his old employer\u2019s decision not to endorse either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump in next month\u2019s presidential election. Baron, who was editor of the Boston Globe before he moved to the capital to run the Post in 2013 \u2013 both of which publications have won Pulitzer prizes under his leadership \u2013 has called the Post\u2019s move to avoid picking a favored nominee for the White House \u201ccowardice\u201d. He posted on X that it represented: \u201cDisturbing spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.\u201d Baron retired from the Washington Post in 2021. You can read the Guardian\u2019s profile of him then, here. As Tim Walz prepares to take the stage in Philadephia for a campaign rally event, here\u2019s a look at where things stand in the world of US politics: For the first time since the 1980s, the Washington Post has said it will not endorse any US presidential candidate this year nor in any future presidential elections. A note from publisher Will Lewis that was posted on X on Friday said: \u201cWe recognize that this will be read in a range of ways, including as a tacit endorsement of one candidate, or as a condemnation of another, or as an abdication of responsibility. That is inevitable. We don\u2019t see it that way.\u201d Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are tied at 48%, according to a new poll by the New York Times and Siena College. Published on Friday, the poll also revealed that 31% of registered voters view Trump as very favorable while 29% view Harris as very favorable. More young Americans favor Kamala Harris over Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race, according to a new Harvard Youth Poll published today by the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School. The poll, which surveyed 2,001 voters under the age of 30 between 3 and 14 October, found that Harris leads Trump by 20 points among registered voters under 30 and by 28 points among likely voters. Joe Biden has issued a statement ahead of his presidential apology for the federal Indian boarding school era, calling it \u201cone of the darkest chapters of American history\u201d. In his statement, Biden said: \u201cThe Federal Indian Boarding School Era is one of the darkest chapters of American history. The trauma experienced in those institutions haunts our conscience to this very day.\u201d Jill Biden is set to campaign alongside Gwen Walz in Michigan and Wisconsin next week. In a press release issued on Friday, the Harris-Walz campaign said that the two educators will campaign in Michigan and Wisconsin, marking the first time they campaign together. With just a few days away from the election, Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign continues to raise significantly more funds than Donald Trump\u2019s. In the first half of October, Harris\u2019s campaign reported $97m raised, according to reports filed on Thursday with the Federal Election Commission, Politico reports. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s campaign raised $16m during this time period. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are taking a detour from barnstorming the battleground states that will decide November\u2019s election with Friday stops in Texas, a conservative state that was the first to implement a near-total abortion ban. Superstar singer Beyonc\u00e9 is expected to join Harris at her Houston stop and perform, two sources told Reuters. Harris has made Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s song Freedom her campaign anthem. For the first time since the 1980s, the Washington Post has said it will not endorse any US presidential candidate this year nor in any future presidential elections. A note from publisher Will Lewis that was posted on X on Friday said: We recognize that this will be read in a range of ways, including as a tacit endorsement of one candidate, or as a condemnation of another, or as an abdication of responsibility. That is inevitable. We don\u2019t see it that way. We see it as consistent with the values The Post has always stood for and what we hope for in a leader: character and courage in service to the American ethic, veneration for the rule of law, and respect for human freedom in all its aspects. We also see it as a statement in support of our readers\u2019 ability to make up their own minds on this, the most consequential of American decisions \u2013 whom to vote for as the next president. Our job at The Washington Post is to provide through the newsroom non-partisan news for all Americans, and thought-provoking, reported views from our opinion team to help our readers make up their own minds. Most of all, our job as the newspaper of the capital city of the most important country in the world is to be independent. And that is what we are and will be. Kamala Harris has released the following statement to mark one year since the Lewiston shootings in Maine when 18 people were killed and another 13 were injured by a gunman who stormed a bowling alley and a restaurant: One year ago, an act of senseless violence carried out with a weapon of war took the lives of 18 loved ones and injured 13 others in Lewiston, Maine. Doug and I join all Mainers in remembering those who lost their lives on that fall night, standing with their families, and thinking of the survivors of this horrific mass shooting. In the 12 months since this tragedy took place at a local restaurant and a bowling alley, the Lewiston community has shown incredible unity, resilience and strength. They have responded by reminding the nation of the unacceptable fact that far too many families have experienced the tremendous pain and trauma caused by the epidemic of gun violence. This is exactly why I have worked to take action to address this issue with the urgency it demands and keep our loved ones safe \u2026 I continue to call on Congress to pass universal background checks, red flag and safe storage laws, a ban on bump stocks, and a renewal of the assault weapons ban. In a new tweet on Friday, Kamala Harris warned of Donald Trump\u2019s threats of using the justice department against his enemies, saying: Donald Trump has been very clear that he would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. You know who does that? Dictators do that. More young Americans favor Kamala Harris over Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race, according to a new Harvard Youth Poll published today by the Institute of Politics (IOP) at Harvard Kennedy School. The poll, which surveyed 2,001 voters under the age of 30 between 3 and 14 October, found that Harris leads Trump by 20 points among registered voters under 30 and by 28 points among likely voters. In the seven key swing states, Harris\u2019s lead narrows to 9 points among registered voters under 30. Interestingly, the survey found that peer influence might play a crucial role in voter turnout for those under 30. When young Americans believe their friends will vote, 79% say they plan to vote as well, per the survey, compared with just 35% for those who think peers will not participate. \u201cThe social dynamic of youth voting has never been more clear: when young Americans believe their friends will vote, they\u2019re nearly two and a half times more likely to cast a ballot themselves,\u201d John Della Volpe, the polling director of the Institute of Politics, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s peer influence, not just politics, that could determine youth turnout this year \u2013 and ultimately who becomes the next president.\u201d Here is the live stream of Tim Walz\u2019s campaign event in Philadelphia: Stay tuned as we bring you the latest updates. Tim Walz is scheduled to attend a campaign rally in Philadephia later this morning. The vice-presidential candidate\u2019s visit to the City of Brotherly Love comes as part of his campaign stops across Pennsylvania, which will also include Allentown and Scranton. Ahead of his Philadelphia rally, Walz spoke to Philadephia-based radio station WHYY on which he said: Donald Trump\u2019s tendencies now are fascist tendencies, he has a long history of his racial comments. His running mate, JD Vance, said voters just don\u2019t like the racist part of Donald Trump. Walz\u2019s comments about Trump follow a slew of similar comments made by Democrats and former Trump allies in recent days who have likened the former president to a fascist. The ongoing elections in Ohio could decide control of the US Senate. Stephen Starr reports for the Guardian: When the Democrat Sherrod Brown was first elected to the US Senate in 2006, Ohio, with its large urban populations and manufacturing industries, was fairly reliable territory for Democrats. Barack Obama claimed the state in 2008 and 2012 on his way to the White House. Democrats boasted strong representation in Ohio\u2019s politics. Analysts zealously watched its voting patterns, such was its prominence as a bellwether state. In the years since, the state has become older, whiter and more conservative. Manufacturing has shrunk and population has stagnated. Brown is now the only Democrat holding a statewide seat in Ohio. And he is weeks out from a crucial Senate election against former luxury car dealer Bernie Moreno, a contest that could reshape US politics for years to come, For one, keeping Brown\u2019s seat is crucial if Democrats hope to maintain their control of the US Senate. For the full story, click here: Joe Biden has issued a statement ahead of his presidential apology for the federal Indian boarding school era, calling it \u201cone of the darkest chapters of American history\u201d. In his statement, Biden said: The Federal Indian Boarding School Era is one of the darkest chapters of American history. The trauma experienced in those institutions haunts our conscience to this very day. Today, I\u2019m in Arizona to issue a long overdue presidential apology for this era \u2013 and speak to how my Administration has worked to invest in Indian Country and our relationships with Tribal Nations, advance Tribal sovereignty and self-determination, respect Native cultures, and protect Indigenous sacred sites. On my watch, we\u2019ll remain committed to ushering in a new era between our government and nation-to-nation relationships \u2013 one that is grounded in dignity and respect. We must remember our full history, even when it\u2019s painful. That\u2019s what great nations do. And we are a great nation. Jill Biden is set to campaign alongside Gwen Walz in Michigan and Wisconsin next week. In a press release issued on Friday, the Harris-Walz campaign said that the two educators will campaign in Michigan and Wisconsin, marking the first time they campaign together. In Bay City, Michigan, they will attend a Women for Harris-Walz event which will focus on reproductive freedoms. In Traverse City, Michigan, the two women will join Harris-Walz campaign supporters for a volunteer mobilization event. In La Crosse, Wisconsin, they will attend an Educators for Harris-Walz event. Former model Stacey Williams says Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein \u2018coordinated\u2019 the groping incident at Trump Towers in 1993. The Guardian\u2019s Jessica Glenza reports: Former model Stacey Williams said she thought Donald Trump groped her to show off to her then boyfriend, the late financier and sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein, when the couple dropped by to visit him in Trump Tower in New York in 1993. In her first detailed, on-camera interview since discussing assault allegations with the Guardian, Williams late on Thursday told CNN that she recalled the former president and Epstein smiled at each other as the property mogul was feeling her up, which gave her the impression the entire incident was a \u201ccoordinated\u201d game between the two men. Her account comes just weeks before the presidential election, in which Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris are essentially tied, according to polls. Trump has denied Williams\u2019s accounts. \u201cThe second he was in front of me, he pulled me into him and his hands were just on me and didn\u2019t come off,\u201d Williams told CNN, echoing her account to the Guardian. \u201cThen the hands started moving on the side of my breasts, on my hips, back down to my butt, back up, sort of \u2013 they were just on me the whole time, and I froze,\u201d she said. For the full story, click here: With just a few days away from election day, Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign continues to raise significantly more funds than Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. In the first half of October, Harris\u2019s campaign reported $97m raised, according to reports filed on Thursday with the Federal Election Commission, Politico reports. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s campaign raised $16m during this time period. The outlet reports: The picture looked slightly better for Trump when looking at his overall political operation, including money raised through joint fundraising committees, but Harris still maintained a significant advantage, with $176 million raised across her network compared to $97 million for Trump when including his affiliated fundraising groups.\u201d It also added that in the first 16 days of October, Harris\u2019s campaign outspent Trump\u2019s campaign significantly \u2013 $166m compared with $99m. For both candidates, paid media was the largest category, with Harris\u2019s campaign spending $127m and Trump\u2019s campaign spending $88m. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are tied at 48%, according to a new poll by the New York Times and Siena College. Published on Friday, the poll, the poll also revealed that 31% of registered voters view Trump as very favorable while 29% view Harris as very favorable. Ms Harris\u2019s position, if anything, may have declined among likely voters since the last Times/Siena College poll, taken in early October. At the time, she had a slight lead over Mr Trump, 49 percent to 46 percent. The change is within the margin of error, but The Times\u2019s national polling average has registered a tightening in polls over the past few weeks as well, suggesting at the very least that this contest has drawn even closer. In response to which candidate would do a better job of handling the issue voters regard as most important, 46% said Harris while 49% said Trump. Additionally, 45% said they believe Harris would do a better job on the economy, compared to 52% who indicated their preference for Trump. On abortion, 55% indicated Harris as the candidate who would do a better job to address the issue, compared to 40% who chose Trump. On immigration, 43% chose Harris while 54% chose Trump. Speaking on CNN in response to what she thinks Kamala Harris needs to do to avoid repeating the 2016 loss to Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton said: \u201cI don\u2019t think she has Jim Comey in the wings waiting to kneecap her so that\u2019s good.\u201d Clinton made the comment in reference to then-FBI director who reopened the investigation into her private email server days before the 2016 election. Clinton went on to add: \u201cI think she is doing what she needs to do, and\u2026a number of the voters who were at [the CNN] town hall have said she convinced them, that she had shown the kind of empathy and concern about their problems, that she had come forward with her ideas, her suggested policies. So, I think she\u2019s doing what she needs to do.\u201d Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are taking a detour from barnstorming the battleground states that will decide November\u2019s election with Friday stops in Texas, a conservative state that was the first to implement a near-total abortion ban. Superstar singer Beyonc\u00e9 is expected to join Harris at her Houston stop and perform, two sources told Reuters. Harris has made Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s song \u201cFreedom\u201d her campaign anthem. Texas hasn\u2019t backed a Democratic president since 1976, and Republican Trump is almost certain to win the state\u2019s 40 electoral college votes, Reuters reported. But Democrats are betting it will provide a powerful backdrop for vice-president Harris to talk about abortion rights in the final days before the election. Harris will speak about the danger former president Trump and Republicans could present to abortion rights across the country if he\u2019s elected, a campaign source said, and be joined by women who have suffered after Texas\u2019 anti-abortion regulations were passed and their family members. Texas implemented a first-of-its kind law in September 2021 that banned abortion after six weeks and allowed anyone to sue abortion patients in violation and those who assisted them. A former model has said Donald Trump and the late sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein were \u201clooking at each other and smiling\u201d while the former president groped her body. Stacey Williams accused the former president of groping and sexually touching her in an incident in Trump Tower in 1993, in what she believed was a \u201ctwisted game\u201d between the two men. Williams, who worked as a professional model in the 1990s, said she first met Trump in 1992 at a Christmas party after being introduced to him by Epstein, who she believed was a good friend of the then New York real estate developer. Williams said Epstein was interested in her and the two casually dated for a period of a few months. Speaking to CNN yesterday, she said Trump greeted them outside his office: The second he was in front of me, he pulled me into him, and his hands were just on me and didn\u2019t come off. And then the hands started moving, and they were on the, you know, on the side of my breasts, on my hips, back down to my butt, back up, sort of then, you know \u2013 they were just on me the whole time. And I froze. I couldn\u2019t understand what was going on. I think I probably was trying to smile and go through the motions of being engaged the way you would in a social situation. But it was an out of body experience. So, I don\u2019t know if I spoke, I don\u2019t know if I answered questions, I don\u2019t know. It was one of the strangest moments of my life. More than 80 Nobel prize winners have endorsed Kamala Harris for the presidency, warning that Donald Trump would \u201cjeopardize any advancements in our standards of living\u201d given his earlier proposals for enormous cuts to science funding. In an open letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, 82 Nobel prize winners from the US in the fields of physics, chemistry, economics and medicine, said \u201cthis is the most consequential presidential election in a long time, perhaps ever, for the future of science and the United States\u201d. The letter, which commends Harris for recognizing that \u201cthe enormous increases in living standards and life expectancies over the past two centuries are largely the result of advances in science and technology\u201d, called Trump a potential threat to progress who could \u201cjeopardize any advancements in our standards of living and impede our responses to climate change\u201d. The Nobel laureates range from a physicist involved in the discovery of remnant light from the Big Bang, to an immunologist instrumental in the development of a specific type of Covid-19 vaccine. They include signatories who won Nobels this month such as molecular biologist Gary Ruvkun, chemist David Baker, physicist John Hopfield and economist Daron Acemoglu. Donald Trump, campaigning in the border swing state of Arizona on Thursday, called the country a \u201cgarbage can\u201d because of immigration policies under the Biden administration. \u201cWe\u2019re like a garbage can, you know, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever said that,\u201d Trump said in Tempe, Arizona, the home of Arizona State University. \u201cAnd every time I come up and talk about what they\u2019ve done to our country, I get angry. First time I\u2019ve ever said garbage can, but you know what, it\u2019s a very accurate description.\u201d Candidates and their surrogates for both presidential campaigns are blitzing swing states like Arizona in the final two weeks before election day. The Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance held two campaign rallies in Arizona earlier this week. Joe Biden and the former president Barack Obama are set to visit this week, as is Tim Walz, the Democratic vice-presidential pick. A banner behind the stage said, \u201cVote early!\u201d \u2013 a change in strategy for Republicans and Trump, who have cast doubt on early and mail-in voting by falsely claiming it is an avenue for widespread fraud. He said of Arizona voting: \u201cThey got a problem. Gotta make it too big to rig.\u201d An image of Trump, raised fist and bloodied ear after his assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, showed before he came out. Early on, he displayed on screens behind him the chart of migration that he has attributed with saving his life. Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump are tied at 48% each for the popular vote for the US presidential election, according to the final New York Times/Siena College national poll published on Friday. Kamala Harris and Barack Obama shared the stage at her Georgia rally on Thursday night. Our video editors have put together this clip from the event: Bruce Springsteen urged voters to back Kamala Harris in the presidential election, warning that Donald Trump is a would-be \u201ctyrant\u201d. \u201cI want a president who reveres the constitution, who does not threaten but wants to protect and guide our great democracy, who believes in the rule of law and the peaceful transfer of power, who will fight for a woman\u2019s right to choose, and who wants to create a middle-class economy that will serve all our citizens,\u201d Springsteen said at the Thursday evening rally. The rally at James R Hallford Stadium in Clarkston, Georgia, drew about 20,000 people, according to the Democratic nominee\u2019s campaign, which would make it her largest political rally yet, besting the 17,000 Harris drew in Greensboro, North Carolina, in early September. \u201cThere is only one candidate in this election who holds those principles dear: Kamala Harris. She\u2019s running to be the 47th president of the United States.\u201d The Born in the USA singer is among the many celebrities stumping for Harris; directors Spike Lee and Tyler Perry, as well as actor Samuel L Jackson, were also in attendance. Good morning and welcome to the US election live blog. I\u2019m Tom Ambrose and I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest from the campaign trail over the next couple of hours. We start with news that vice-president Kamala Harris appeared with Barack Obama for the first time, offering closing arguments targeting Black voters in Atlanta\u2019s eastern suburbs, a vibrant, symbolic part of Georgia. \u201cOurs is a fight for the future,\u201d Harris said at the rally in Clarkston. She touched on familiar themes \u2013 reducing the costs of drugs, housing and groceries. \u201cI come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from. Harris said she believes \u201chealthcare should be a right and not just a privilege for those who can afford it\u201d, and said Trump would gut the Affordable Care Act and roll back the $35 cap on insulin. The Democratic nominee also reaffirmed her support for abortion rights, referring to the death of Amber Nicole Thurman, a Georgia woman whose death was recently found to be a result of the state\u2019s abortion ban. Harris said: \u201cDonald Trump still refuses to acknowledge the pain and suffering he has caused \u2026 women are being denied care during miscarriages.\u201d For more on the rally, see George Chidi\u2019s full report here: Meanwhile, in other news: The family of Amber Nicole Thurman, a Black 28-year-old mother who died just weeks after Georgia\u2019s abortion ban went into effect, was in attendance at the Harris rally. Harris is expected to make another high profile appearance today, this time alongside Beyonc\u00e9 in Houston, where the vice-president hopes to rally support for Senate candidate Colin Allred. Donald Trump rallied supporters in Tempe, Arizona, where he spoke alongside Senate candidate Kari Lake. Earlier in the day, Trump made news when he vowed that, if elected, he would immediately fire Jack Smith, the justice department special counsel who is prosecuting him for allegedly plotting to overturn the 2020 election and hide classified documents. Trump called the country a \u201cgarbage can\u201d because of immigration policies under the Biden administration. \u201cWe\u2019re like a garbage can, you know, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever said that,\u201d Trump said in Tempe, the home of Arizona State University. \u201cAnd every time I come up and talk about what they\u2019ve done to our country, I get angry. First time I\u2019ve ever said garbage can, but you know what, it\u2019s a very accurate description.\u201d Phoenix police arrested a man suspected of setting fire to a mailbox there, damaging mail-in ballots. The news comes just days after Tempe police arrested another man in connection with three shootings at Democratic party campaign offices in Tempe. An Arizona prosecutor said the second man had more than 120 guns and more than 250,000 rounds of ammunition in his home, leading law enforcement to believe he may have been planning a mass casualty event. Harris picked up the endorsement of two Republicans, one a former congressman from Michigan, the other a mayor in a pivotal county in Wisconsin. Joe Biden announced he will issue an apology for the US government\u2019s role in forcing thousands of Indigenous American children to attend Indian boarding schools \u2013 a policy which has been widely recognized as an element of genocide. The news comes as Harris is trailing in the polls in Arizona, a state that Biden famously won in 2020, largely due to the support of Indigenous American voters. More than 29 million people have voted already in the 2024 election, at least partly driven by Republicans embracing early voting at Donald Trump\u2019s direction. So far, Republicans have cast 32% of ballots, up from 27% at this point in 2020. Whereas Democrats have cast 42% of the votes, down from 47% at this point in the last presidential election.",

The White House said it understood Israel was conducting the strikes \u201cas an exercise of self-defence\u201d.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>There was no immediate official Iranian comment about the source of explosions</strong>, which Iranian news outlets reported were under investigation.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Some of the blasts reportedly occurred near Imam Khomeni international airport</strong>.

But that is a difficult balance to strike and a slight miscalculation could lead to devastating consequences for the region.</p> \n  <p>It will still take some time before the precise targets of the pre-dawn raids are confirmed. Israel said they were in part a response to Iran\u2019s launching of more than 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, which in turn was a response to Israel\u2019s assassination of Hezbollah leader <strong>Hassan Nasrallah</strong>.</p> \n  <p>Explosions were reported over Tehran and nearby Karaj, as well as possibly at sites in Isfahan, Mashhad and Kurdistan province. Some of the explosions took place near Imam Khomeni international airport, according to reports, although civilian flights were operating normally as of Saturday morning, according to the Tasnim news agency.</p> \n  <p>Overall, the strikes appeared to target military bases, including a barracks and a military warehouse in Tehran, according to the US broadcaster NBC citing defence sources. A source in Israel told the outlet that it was not targeting nuclear or oil facilities.</p> \n  <p>Biden administration officials will hope that they have dissuaded Israel from targeting some of Iran\u2019s most sensitive infrastructure, including the oil production facilities and those tied to Iran\u2019s nascent nuclear program.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated

today\u2019s strikes, Israel and Iran have been locked in a years-long shadow war.</p> \n  <p>As the Associated Press reports:</p> \n  <p><em>Israel and Iran have been bitter foes since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israel considers Iran to be its greatest threat, citing its leaders\u2019 calls for Israel\u2019s destruction, their support for anti-Israel militant groups and the country\u2019s nuclear program.</em></p> \n  <p><em>A suspected Israeli assassination campaign has killed top Iranian nuclear scientists. Iranian nuclear installations have been hacked or sabotaged, all in mysterious attacks blamed on Israel. Meanwhile, Iran has been blamed for a series of attacks on shipping in the Middle East in recent years, which later grew into the attacks by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels on shipping through the Red Sea corridor.</em></p> \n  <p><em>But since Hamas\u2019 7 October attack, the battle has increasingly moved into the open. Israel has recently turned its attention to Hezbollah, which has been firing rockets into Israel since the war in Gaza began. Throughout the year, a number of top Iranian military figures have been killed in Israeli strikes in Syria and Lebanon.</em></p> \n  <p><em>Iran fired a wave of missiles and drones at Israel last April after two Iranian generals were killed in an apparent Israeli airstrike in Syria on an Iranian diplomatic post. The missiles and drones caused minimum damage, and Israel \u2013 under pressure from western countries to show restraint \u2013 responded with a limited strike.</em></p> \n  <p><em>But after Iran\u2019s early October missile strike, Israel promised a tougher response.</em></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-26T01:13:58.453Z\">at 2.13am

Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Israeli military strikes across Gaza have killed at least 72 Palestinians since Thursday night, including strikes on residential areas in southern Gaza that killed 38 people, including 13 children from the same extended family, Palestinian health officials said. </strong>Gaza\u2019s health ministry reported that dozens of people were wounded as Israeli airstrikes and shelling pounded the southern city of Khan Younis. Palestinians said the neighbourhood was hit with no warning. Israeli strikes on three houses in Beit Lahiya killed 25 people and wounded dozens more, medics said. Later on Friday, an Israeli airstrike killed nine people in Shati camp in Gaza City, medics said.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Israeli forces stormed Kamal Adwan hospital, one of the few medical facilities still functioning in north Gaza, on Thursday night, according to reports. </strong>\u201cIsraeli forces have stormed and are present inside Kamal Adwan hospital\u201d in the city of Jabalia, Gaza\u2019s health ministry said. The World Health Organization said on Friday it lost touch with staff at the hospital, where some had been the night before to deliver supplies and help transfer patients to Shifa hospital in Gaza City. The hospital\u2019s director, <strong>Abu Safiya,</strong> could not be reached on Friday.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The UN rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk,</strong> <strong>described Israel\u2019s renewed assault on northern Gaza as the \u201cdarkest moment\u201d</strong> <strong>of the year-long war on the territory so far. \u201c</strong>We are facing what could amount to atrocity crimes, including potentially extending to crimes against humanity,\u201d T\u00fcrk said in a statement on Friday.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Three journalists from the Hezbollah-affiliated TV stations Al Mayadeen and Al-Manar were killed and several others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on their press station in Hasbaya, southern Lebanon, early on Friday morning. </strong>The strikes hit a group of small chalets that 18 journalists from at least seven different media outlets \u2013 including Al Jazeera, Sky News Arabia and TRT \u2013 were staying in while covering the Israel-Hezbollah war in south Lebanon. Several cars with \u201cPress\u201d signs on them were parked in front of the site. Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, <strong>Najib Mikati,</strong> said the attack was \u201cdeliberate\u201d and \u201caims to terrorise the media to cover up crimes and destruction\u201d.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Lebanon\u2019s health minister, Firass Abiad, said more than 163 rescuers and health workers have been killed and 272 injured in Israeli airstrikes</strong> during more than a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Abiad, speaking to reporters on Friday, said Israel has carried out attacks on 55 hospitals, 36 of which were directly hit. Eight hospitals have been closed while seven are still partially functioning, he said. Attacks against the medical and paramedic sectors in Lebanon are direct and intentional aggressions,\u201d Abiad said. \u201cThis is a war crime.\u201d</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Two people were killed in a strike on Majd al-Krum in northern Israel, Israeli media said on Friday</strong>, following a statement from Hezbollah saying that it targeted the northern Israeli town of Karmiel with a large missile salvo.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>UN peacekeepers withdrew from a observation post in Zahajra town in south Lebanon on Tuesday after Israeli forces fired at it</strong>, <strong>the force said on Friday.</strong> Unifil added that the Israeli military has repeatedly demanded that its peacekeepers vacate its positions along the Blue Line and deliberately damaged camera, lighting and communications equipment at some of these positions.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Lebanon\u2019s transport minister, Ali Hamieh, said Israeli bombing put a second border crossing between the country and Syria out of service -</strong>leaving one official passage between the two nations operational. The UN refugee agency (Unhcr) warned that Israel\u2019s overnight airstrike on the Jousieh crossing in Lebanon\u2019s northern Bekaa area jeopardised the main escape route for people fleeing the conflict in Lebanon in search of refuge in Syria. More than half a million people, mostly Syrians, had crossed into Syrian territory since Israel began heavily striking Lebanon late last month, according to figures by the Lebanese authorities on Friday.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Jordan\u2019s foreign minister,</strong> <strong>Ayman Safadi,</strong> <strong>called for pressure on Israel to end what he called the \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d in Gaza, as he met the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in London. </strong>Blinken, who is still hoping Gaza peace talks can be revived, stopped over in the UK to brief leaders from Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan after he had been unable to meet them on his recent tour of the Middle East.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Blinken also met with Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, Najib Mikati in London on Friday.</strong> The US \u2013 Israel\u2019s biggest arms supplier \u2013 has stopped short of calling for an immediate ceasefire in Israel\u2019s month of bombing of Lebanon, but is instead calling for a diplomatic resolution. Blinken said Israel \u201cmust take the necessary steps to avoid civilian casualties and not endanger UN peacekeepers or the Lebanese armed forces.\u201d</p></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-25T17:56:51.593Z\">at 6.56pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-671bc8b68f08d3f94c2b9d98\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-25T16:48:52.528Z\">5.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d1d2a75c-259c-4152-96d0-a441cfb36b75\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bE7kBOQcwHE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-671bc78e8f08d3f94c2b9d59\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-25T16:30:25.220Z\">5.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Israeli strikes have killed 38 people, many of them children, in Gaza as well as three journalists in Lebanon, as worries grow about supply shortages in Gaza and international pressure for a ceasefire increases.</strong></p> \n  <p>The deaths reported by Gaza health officials were the latest in the southern Gaza City of Khan Younis, where people have in recent days lined up for bread outside the city\u2019s only bakery in operation, AP reported.</p> \n  <p>They come a day after US secretary of state Antony Blinken said that Israel had accomplished its objective of \u201ceffectively dismantling\u201d Hamas and implored both sides to revive negotiations.</p> \n  <p>Hours before Mr Blinken was set to meet with Arab leaders in London on Friday, an Israeli airstrike on guesthouses where journalists were staying in south-east Lebanon killed three members of staff.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-671bc01a8f08d3f94c2b9c9a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-25T15:58:29.655Z\">4.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-671bb04e8f080a42be756729\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-25T15:33:21.179Z\">4.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Two people were killed in a strike on Majd al-Krum in northern Israel, Israeli media said on Friday</strong>, following a statement from Hezbollah saying that it targeted the northern Israeli town of Karmiel with a large missile salvo.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-671bad6b8f080a42be7566f6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-25T14:50:45.650Z\">3.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lebanon has been placed on financial crime watchlist, international body says</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Lebanon has been placed on a so-called \u2018grey list\u2019 of countries under special scrutiny by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the financial crime watchdog said on Friday, despite requests for leniency from Lebanese officials.</strong></p> \n  <p>The FATF said Lebanon had made progress on several recommended actions and would continue to implement reforms, Reuters reported.</p> \n  <p>Lebanon has been in a financial crisis since 2019 and faces destruction from Israeli military operations against armed group Hezbollah.

Blinken is still hoping the Gaza peace talks can be revived.</p> \n  <p>Deploring the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza, Safadi told Blinken: \u201cWe do see ethnic cleansing taking place, and that has got to stop.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He added:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>We really stand at the brink of regional war now. The only path to save the region from that is for Israel to stop the aggressions on Gaza, on Lebanon, stop unilateral measures, illegal measures, in the West Bank, that is also pushing the situation to an abyss.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>On 13 October, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/15/us-israel-weapons-gaza-aid-letter\">Blinken wrote jointly with the US defence secretary Lloyd Austin</a> to Israel urging the country to increase the number of aid trucks entering Gaza to 350 per day within 30 days. But since then no day has seen the number of trucks exceed 114, whilst the number of trucks inside Gaza but unable to distribute aid has risen 470 to 700.</p> \n  <p>The amount of aid entering Gaza is at record low levels in October, and although Blinken in the Middle East claimed to have seen an improvement, Arab diplomatic sources said the figures are nowhere near the level the Biden administration previously said in its letter that would be required for the US administration to stop supplying Israel with arms.</p> \n  <p>Separately in talks with Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister <strong>Najib Mikati</strong>, Blinken said: \u201cWe have a sense of real urgency in getting to a diplomatic resolution and the full implementation of UN security council resolution 1701, such that there can be real security along the border between Israel and Lebanon.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He said it was important so \u201cpeople at both sides of the border can have the confidence to be able to return to their homes.\u201d</p> \n  <p>His remarks stop short of a call for an immediate ceasefire, the position adopted by the French since the US believes that if Hezbollah can be weakened further the political deadlock that prevents the formation of a full government can be broken.</p> \n  <p>Resolution 1701, approved in 2006 after an earlier war, calls for the disarmament of non-state groups in Lebanon \u2013 including to the Hezbollah group, which effectively runs its own armed militia \u2013 and for a full Israeli withdrawal from the country.</p> \n  <p>One precondition for a full implementation of 1701 is strengthening the official Lebanese armed forces.

We\u2019re about to launch a fresh blog on this morning\u2019s retaliatory Israeli strikes on Iran. In the meantime here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments. And all our coverage of the crisis in the Middle East can be seen here. Israel launched airstrikes against Iran early on Saturday, with at least seven explosions reported over the capital, Tehran, and nearby Karaj just after 2.30am local time. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had begun to launch \u201cprecise strikes on military targets in Iran\u201d in response to \u201cmonths of continuous attacks\u201d from Iran against Israel. Iranian state TV reported several strong explosions heard around Tehran. There were no casualties, the state news agency IRNA said. Fresh blasts were reportedly heard around Tehran on Saturday shortly after reports of earlier ones. Continuous explosions and light trails were visible across the sky in central Tehran, Agence France-Presse said. A US official confirmed that Israel notified Washington before carrying out the strikes, and that the US had no involvement in Israel\u2019s military operation. The White House said it understood Israel was conducting the strikes \u201cas an exercise of self-defence\u201d. There was no immediate official Iranian comment about the source of explosions, which Iranian news outlets reported were under investigation. Some of the blasts reportedly occurred near Imam Khomeni international airport. Iran\u2019s Tasnim news agency said civilian flights were operating normally as of Friday morning. Analysis: There was little doubt that Israel would eventually launch Saturday\u2019s counterstrike against Iran in the latest tit-for-tat exchange between the two largest militaries in the Middle East. But the scale and targets of that attack has been the subject of intense diplomatic wrangling between Israel and Washington, as the Biden administration hoped that it could restrain Benjamin Netanyahu from launching a devastating reprisal that could spiral into an all-out war. What the White House hopes is that Israel can fulfil a declaration by defence minister Yoav Gallant to make the world \u201cunderstand [Israel\u2019s] might\u201d but not humiliate Iran to the degree that it would launch an even greater retaliation. But that is a difficult balance to strike and a slight miscalculation could lead to devastating consequences for the region. It will still take some time before the precise targets of the pre-dawn raids are confirmed. Israel said they were in part a response to Iran\u2019s launching of more than 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, which in turn was a response to Israel\u2019s assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Explosions were reported over Tehran and nearby Karaj, as well as possibly at sites in Isfahan, Mashhad and Kurdistan province. Some of the explosions took place near Imam Khomeni international airport, according to reports, although civilian flights were operating normally as of Saturday morning, according to the Tasnim news agency. Overall, the strikes appeared to target military bases, including a barracks and a military warehouse in Tehran, according to the US broadcaster NBC citing defence sources. A source in Israel told the outlet that it was not targeting nuclear or oil facilities. Biden administration officials will hope that they have dissuaded Israel from targeting some of Iran\u2019s most sensitive infrastructure, including the oil production facilities and those tied to Iran\u2019s nascent nuclear program. New blasts have reportedly been heard around the Iranian capital on Saturday, shortly after reports of earlier ones. Continuous explosions and light trails were visible across the sky in central Tehran, according to Agence France-Presse reporters. Vice-president Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee for next month\u2019s US election, has been briefed on the Israeli strikes on Iranian military targets, a White House official said. She is closely following developments and will continue to be updated. As we reported earlier, the White House said it understood Israel was conducting the strikes \u201cas an exercise of self-defence\u201d. Iranian state TV is saying the explosions heard were due to the \u201cactivation of air defence system\u201d, Agence France-Presse reports. As our just-updated full report says, at least seven explosions were heard over Iran\u2019s capital, Tehran, and nearby Karaj just after 2.30am local time on Saturday, as Israeli jets struck what were described as \u201cmilitary targets\u201d in the country. It was not immediately clear if that marked the end of the attack. Iran\u2019s state TV reported several strong explosions heard around Tehran, while the state news agency, IRNA, said there had been no casualties. There was no immediate official comment about the source of explosions, which Iranian news outlets reported were under investigation. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had begun to launch strikes against Iran. Iraq has suspended flights in all its airports until further notice, Reuters cites the state news agency as saying. For more background on today\u2019s strikes, Israel and Iran have been locked in a years-long shadow war. As the Associated Press reports: Israel and Iran have been bitter foes since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israel considers Iran to be its greatest threat, citing its leaders\u2019 calls for Israel\u2019s destruction, their support for anti-Israel militant groups and the country\u2019s nuclear program. A suspected Israeli assassination campaign has killed top Iranian nuclear scientists. Iranian nuclear installations have been hacked or sabotaged, all in mysterious attacks blamed on Israel. Meanwhile, Iran has been blamed for a series of attacks on shipping in the Middle East in recent years, which later grew into the attacks by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels on shipping through the Red Sea corridor. But since Hamas\u2019 7 October attack, the battle has increasingly moved into the open. Israel has recently turned its attention to Hezbollah, which has been firing rockets into Israel since the war in Gaza began. Throughout the year, a number of top Iranian military figures have been killed in Israeli strikes in Syria and Lebanon. Iran fired a wave of missiles and drones at Israel last April after two Iranian generals were killed in an apparent Israeli airstrike in Syria on an Iranian diplomatic post. The missiles and drones caused minimum damage, and Israel \u2013 under pressure from western countries to show restraint \u2013 responded with a limited strike. But after Iran\u2019s early October missile strike, Israel promised a tougher response. Israel\u2019s strikes on Iran occurred just as the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, was arriving back in the US after a tour of the Middle East where he urged Israel to respond to Iran in a way that would not further escalate the conflict in the region and would exclude nuclear sites in Iran. The Associated Press also reports that the White House\u2019s National Security Council spokesman, Sean Savett, said it understood Israel was conducting the strikes against Iranian military targets and referred reporters to the Israeli government for more details on their operation. Iranian media says no fires or explosions were reported at a key Tehran refinery. The Tasnim news agency was referring to a key oil refinery south of the capital, Agence France-Presse reports. The Israeli military posted on X that Lieut Gen Herzi Halevi, the chief of the general staff, is commanding the strike on Iran from the Israeli air force underground command centre in Camp Rabin with the commander of the Israeli air force, Maj Gen Tomer Bar. Here\u2019s our full report, just sent live, on Israel\u2019s strikes on Iran early today. Several military bases in Iran\u2019s west and south-west of Tehran have been targeted by Israel, Reuters cites the semi-official Iranian news agency Fars as reporting. A resident in Tehran says at least seven explosions could be heard and they rattled the Iranian\u2019s capital\u2019s surrounding area. Associated Press reports the resident spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. Iranian state-run media in Tehran initially acknowledged the blasts and said some of the sounds came from air defence systems around the city. Meanwhile in Syria, state media described its air defences as targeting \u201chostile targets\u201d there as well. A US official says the United States has no involvement in Israel\u2019s military operation against targets in Iran. Reuters also cites the White House as saying it understood that Israel was conducting the strikes against military targets \u201cas an exercise of self-defence\u201d. A US official confirmed that Israel notified Washington before carrying out the strikes. For some background, Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant said this week that its planned airstrikes on Iran would make the world understand Israel\u2019s military might As Julian Borger and William Christou reported, the Middle East has been braced for more than three weeks for a threatened Israeli response to Iran\u2019s 1 October missile attack, which was in turn a reprisal for Israel\u2019s killing of Hezbollah\u2019s leader, Hassan Nasrallah. Gallant visited aircrews at Hatzerim airbase on Wednesday and made clear that Israel still intended to strike back. \u201cAfter we attack in Iran, they will understand in Israel and elsewhere what your preparations have included,\u201d Gallant told the crews in a video distributed by his office. On X, Gallant added more about his exchange with the air force personnel, saying: In my conversation with them I emphasised \u2013 after we attack Iran, everyone will understand your might, the process of preparation and training \u2013 any enemy that tries to harm the state of Israel will pay a heavy price. The Guardian\u2019s report continued: The extent of Israel\u2019s target list has been the subject of protracted conversations between Israeli leaders and the Biden administration, which has urged them not to strike Iran\u2019s oil industry infrastructure or its nuclear programme. Washington fears a cycle of escalation, particularly in the last two weeks before the US presidential election. The White House was notified shortly before Israel carried out the airstrikes on Iran, Reuters quotes Fox News as reporting. The Israeli military is now conducting \u201cprecise strikes on military targets in Iran\u201d, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has just posted on X. The strikes are in response to \u201cmonths of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the state of Israel\u201d, the IDF post says. It also says Israel\u2019s \u201cdefensive and offensive capabilities are fully mobilized\u201d. The regime in Iran and its proxies in the region have been relentlessly attacking Israel since October 7th \u2013 on seven fronts \u2013 including direct attacks from Iranian soil. Like every other sovereign country in the world, the state of Israel has the right and the duty to respond. Our defensive and offensive capabilities are fully mobilized. We will do whatever necessary to defend the state of Israel and the people of Israel. Iran\u2019s state TV has reported several strong explosions being heard around Tehran but that there is no official comment about the source of explosions, Reuters is reporting. Semi-official Iranian media said the cause of the blasts was unknown. Israel has been planning a response to a ballistic-missile barrage carried out by Iran on 1 October, Tehran\u2019s second direct attack on Israel in six months. Israeli journalist Barak Ravid, who works for Axios, just posted on X that Israel has conducted airstrikes in Iran, citing two sources as telling him. It has just passed 2.50am in the Iranian capital. At least five explosions have been heard in Iran\u2019s capital, Tehran, and in nearby Karaj city, Reuters has just quoted semi-official Iranian media as saying. This is Adam Fulton restarting our live coverage of the Middle East crisis We\u2019re pausing this blog for the moment but will bring you latest breaking news as it happens. You can read all our latest coverage from the region here: See all our Middle East coverage The EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said journalists are \u201cpaying a heavy price\u201d while covering the conflict in the Middle East. Posting to X after three journalists were killed and several others wounded in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon this morning, Borrell said: Press freedom and access must be guaranteed &amp; journalists protected, always. More than half a million people, mostly Syrians, had crossed into Syrian territory since Israel began heavily striking Lebanon late last month, according to figures by the Lebanese authorities on Friday. A statement from the country\u2019s disaster management unit stated that since 23 September, Lebanon has \u201crecorded the crossing of 348,237 Syrian citizens and 156,505 Lebanese citizens into Syrian territory\u201d. Meanwhile, as we reported earlier, Israeli bombing has reportedly put a second border crossing between Lebanon and Syria out of service, leaving just one official passage between the two nations operational. The UN refugee agency (Unhcr) warned that Israel\u2019s overnight airstrike on the Jousieh crossing in Lebanon\u2019s northern Bekaa area jeopardised the main escape route for people fleeing the conflict in Lebanon in search of refuge in Syria. Unhcr Middle East spokesperson Rula Amin, at a media briefing on Friday, said the crossing \u201cis the only route these people have to escape Lebanon\u201d, adding: This is hindering and really putting at risk a main lifeline that people use to escape the conflict in Lebanon and cross into Syria. Amin said the Jousieh strike hit within 500 metres (550 yards) of the immigration office, with no prior notification given. It is the second such gateway hit by the Israeli army this month. The Israeli military confirmed that it had struck the Jousieh crossing, saying it was being used by Hezbollah to transfer weapons. It\u2019s 8.30pm in Gaza, Beirut and Tel Aviv. Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments: Israeli military strikes across Gaza have killed at least 72 Palestinians since Thursday night, including strikes on residential areas in southern Gaza that killed 38 people, including 13 children from the same extended family, Palestinian health officials said. Gaza\u2019s health ministry reported that dozens of people were wounded as Israeli airstrikes and shelling pounded the southern city of Khan Younis. Palestinians said the neighbourhood was hit with no warning. Israeli strikes on three houses in Beit Lahiya killed 25 people and wounded dozens more, medics said. Later on Friday, an Israeli airstrike killed nine people in Shati camp in Gaza City, medics said. Israeli forces stormed Kamal Adwan hospital, one of the few medical facilities still functioning in north Gaza, on Thursday night, according to reports. \u201cIsraeli forces have stormed and are present inside Kamal Adwan hospital\u201d in the city of Jabalia, Gaza\u2019s health ministry said. The World Health Organization said on Friday it lost touch with staff at the hospital, where some had been the night before to deliver supplies and help transfer patients to Shifa hospital in Gaza City. The hospital\u2019s director, Abu Safiya, could not be reached on Friday. The UN rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk, described Israel\u2019s renewed assault on northern Gaza as the \u201cdarkest moment\u201d of the year-long war on the territory so far. \u201cWe are facing what could amount to atrocity crimes, including potentially extending to crimes against humanity,\u201d T\u00fcrk said in a statement on Friday. Three journalists from the Hezbollah-affiliated TV stations Al Mayadeen and Al-Manar were killed and several others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on their press station in Hasbaya, southern Lebanon, early on Friday morning. The strikes hit a group of small chalets that 18 journalists from at least seven different media outlets \u2013 including Al Jazeera, Sky News Arabia and TRT \u2013 were staying in while covering the Israel-Hezbollah war in south Lebanon. Several cars with \u201cPress\u201d signs on them were parked in front of the site. Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, Najib Mikati, said the attack was \u201cdeliberate\u201d and \u201caims to terrorise the media to cover up crimes and destruction\u201d. Lebanon\u2019s health minister, Firass Abiad, said more than 163 rescuers and health workers have been killed and 272 injured in Israeli airstrikes during more than a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Abiad, speaking to reporters on Friday, said Israel has carried out attacks on 55 hospitals, 36 of which were directly hit. Eight hospitals have been closed while seven are still partially functioning, he said. Attacks against the medical and paramedic sectors in Lebanon are direct and intentional aggressions,\u201d Abiad said. \u201cThis is a war crime.\u201d Two people were killed in a strike on Majd al-Krum in northern Israel, Israeli media said on Friday, following a statement from Hezbollah saying that it targeted the northern Israeli town of Karmiel with a large missile salvo. UN peacekeepers withdrew from a observation post in Zahajra town in south Lebanon on Tuesday after Israeli forces fired at it, the force said on Friday. Unifil added that the Israeli military has repeatedly demanded that its peacekeepers vacate its positions along the Blue Line and deliberately damaged camera, lighting and communications equipment at some of these positions. Lebanon\u2019s transport minister, Ali Hamieh, said Israeli bombing put a second border crossing between the country and Syria out of service -leaving one official passage between the two nations operational. The UN refugee agency (Unhcr) warned that Israel\u2019s overnight airstrike on the Jousieh crossing in Lebanon\u2019s northern Bekaa area jeopardised the main escape route for people fleeing the conflict in Lebanon in search of refuge in Syria. More than half a million people, mostly Syrians, had crossed into Syrian territory since Israel began heavily striking Lebanon late last month, according to figures by the Lebanese authorities on Friday. Jordan\u2019s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, called for pressure on Israel to end what he called the \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d in Gaza, as he met the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in London. Blinken, who is still hoping Gaza peace talks can be revived, stopped over in the UK to brief leaders from Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan after he had been unable to meet them on his recent tour of the Middle East. Blinken also met with Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, Najib Mikati in London on Friday. The US \u2013 Israel\u2019s biggest arms supplier \u2013 has stopped short of calling for an immediate ceasefire in Israel\u2019s month of bombing of Lebanon, but is instead calling for a diplomatic resolution. Blinken said Israel \u201cmust take the necessary steps to avoid civilian casualties and not endanger UN peacekeepers or the Lebanese armed forces.\u201d Israeli strikes have killed 38 people, many of them children, in Gaza as well as three journalists in Lebanon, as worries grow about supply shortages in Gaza and international pressure for a ceasefire increases. The deaths reported by Gaza health officials were the latest in the southern Gaza City of Khan Younis, where people have in recent days lined up for bread outside the city\u2019s only bakery in operation, AP reported. They come a day after US secretary of state Antony Blinken said that Israel had accomplished its objective of \u201ceffectively dismantling\u201d Hamas and implored both sides to revive negotiations. Hours before Mr Blinken was set to meet with Arab leaders in London on Friday, an Israeli airstrike on guesthouses where journalists were staying in south-east Lebanon killed three members of staff. Two people were killed in a strike on Majd al-Krum in northern Israel, Israeli media said on Friday, following a statement from Hezbollah saying that it targeted the northern Israeli town of Karmiel with a large missile salvo. Lebanon has been placed on a so-called \u2018grey list\u2019 of countries under special scrutiny by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the financial crime watchdog said on Friday, despite requests for leniency from Lebanese officials. The FATF said Lebanon had made progress on several recommended actions and would continue to implement reforms, Reuters reported. Lebanon has been in a financial crisis since 2019 and faces destruction from Israeli military operations against armed group Hezbollah. The grey-listing is likely to further deter investment and could affect the links between some Lebanese banks and the global financial system. The international criminal court (ICC) on Friday said it would replace one of its judges on health grounds, in a move that could further delay a decision on the prosecution\u2019s request to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In May, prosecutors asked for warrants for Netanyahu and his defence minister Yoav Gallant as well as three Hamas leaders, saying there were reasonable grounds that the men had committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, Reuters reported. The president of the ICC said the presiding judge in the case, Romanian magistrate Iulia Motoc, had asked to be replaced on health grounds on Friday and was immediately replaced with Slovenian ICC judge Beti Hohler. The replacement is expected to further delay a decision on possible warrants in the case looking at the Gaza conflict as the new judge will need time to catch up on the filings. The Israeli military said on Friday that three of its soldiers were killed in combat in northern Gaza Strip. The UN rights chief, Volker Turk, has issued a statement in which he describes Israel\u2019s renewed assault on northern Gaza as the \u201cdarkest moment\u201d of the year-long war on the territory so far. He said: Unimaginably, the situation is getting worse by the day. The Israeli government\u2019s policies and practices in northern Gaza risk emptying the area of all Palestinians. We are facing what could amount to atrocity crimes, including potentially extending to crimes against humanity. Turk said \u201cmore than 150,000 people are reportedly dead, wounded or missing in Gaza\u201d since the war was launched last October. \u201cMy gravest fear is, given the intensity, breadth, scale and blatant nature of the Israeli operation currently underway in North Gaza, that number will rise dramatically,\u201d he said. Israeli forces began the devastating offensive in the north about three weeks ago with the declared aim of preventing Hamas fighters from regrouping. Residents, however, say the troops have besieged shelters, levelled civilian infrastructure, forced displaced people to leave with nowhere safe to go, while killing many civilians in deadly airstrikes. Medics say at least 800 Palestinians have been killed in northern Gaza since the new offensive was launched. Patrick Wintour is the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor. Jordan\u2019s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, has called for pressure on Israel to end \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d, as he met US secretary of state Antony Blinken in London. Blinken stopped over in London to brief leaders from Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan after he had been unable to meet them on his recent tour of the Middle East. Blinken is still hoping the Gaza peace talks can be revived. Deploring the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza, Safadi told Blinken: \u201cWe do see ethnic cleansing taking place, and that has got to stop.\u201d He added: We really stand at the brink of regional war now. The only path to save the region from that is for Israel to stop the aggressions on Gaza, on Lebanon, stop unilateral measures, illegal measures, in the West Bank, that is also pushing the situation to an abyss. On 13 October, Blinken wrote jointly with the US defence secretary Lloyd Austin to Israel urging the country to increase the number of aid trucks entering Gaza to 350 per day within 30 days. But since then no day has seen the number of trucks exceed 114, whilst the number of trucks inside Gaza but unable to distribute aid has risen 470 to 700. The amount of aid entering Gaza is at record low levels in October, and although Blinken in the Middle East claimed to have seen an improvement, Arab diplomatic sources said the figures are nowhere near the level the Biden administration previously said in its letter that would be required for the US administration to stop supplying Israel with arms. Separately in talks with Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati, Blinken said: \u201cWe have a sense of real urgency in getting to a diplomatic resolution and the full implementation of UN security council resolution 1701, such that there can be real security along the border between Israel and Lebanon.\u201d He said it was important so \u201cpeople at both sides of the border can have the confidence to be able to return to their homes.\u201d His remarks stop short of a call for an immediate ceasefire, the position adopted by the French since the US believes that if Hezbollah can be weakened further the political deadlock that prevents the formation of a full government can be broken. Resolution 1701, approved in 2006 after an earlier war, calls for the disarmament of non-state groups in Lebanon \u2013 including to the Hezbollah group, which effectively runs its own armed militia \u2013 and for a full Israeli withdrawal from the country. One precondition for a full implementation of 1701 is strengthening the official Lebanese armed forces. On Thursday, at a Paris Conference, the international community pledged to pay \u20ac200m to strengthen the Lebanese army, in particular by recruiting soldiers. A further \u20ac800m was raised to help the humanitarian crisis. Mitaki said his government\u2019s priority is reaching \u201ca ceasefire and deterring the Israeli aggression\u201d. He added there are more than 1.4 million people who have been displaced from the areas that are being attacked by Israel. \u201cIsrael is also violating international law by attacking civilians, journalists and medical staff,\u201d he said. He said \u201cwhat is required is a real commitment from Israel to a ceasefire, because the previous experience regarding the American-French call, supported by the Arabs and the international community, for a ceasefire affected everyone\u2019s credibility.\u201d Mitaki was referring to a proposal for an initial 21-day truce agreed at the UN general assembly in the false belief that it had the support of the Israelis. Israel\u2019s military humanitarian unit, Cogat, which oversees aid and commercial shipments to Gaza, said earlier today it had allowed the transfer of 23 patients out of the Kamal Adwan hospital the previous night by Palestinian ambulances and UN vehicles. Cogat said it had allowed the transfer of one fuel truck, \u201c180 blood units and a truckload of medical equipment\u201d donated by UN agencies. In an earlier post, we referenced reports that Israeli troops surrounded Kamal Adwan hospital \u2013 the last functioning hospital in Gaza\u2019s north \u2013 last night. Gaza\u2019s health ministry said hundreds of patients and staff have been detained in north Gaza\u2019s last functioning hospital. \u201cIsraeli forces have stormed and are present inside Kamal Adwan Hospital\u201d in the city of Jabalia, the ministry said in a statement. \u201cThey are detaining hundreds of patients, medical staff and some displaced individuals from neighbouring areas who sought refuge in the hospital from continuous bombardment,\u201d it added. The director general of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said his staff have lost contact with personnel at the facility since reports of the Israeli raid surfaced this morning. He described this as a \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d development as there were many injured patients being treated there and others sheltering from relentless Israeli bombardments in the area. In a post on X, in which he reiterated calls for an immediate ceasefire, the WHO chief added: Kamal Adwan hospital has been overflowing with close to 200 patients - a constant stream of horrific trauma cases. It is also full of hundreds of people seeking shelter. Accessing hospitals across Gaza is getting unbelievably harder and exposes our staff to unnecessary danger. Kamal Adwan has been struggling with shortages since the start of war, but these have been worsened by a renewed Israeli assault on northern Gaza in recent weeks that the IDF says was launched to stop the regrouping of Hamas fighters there. \u201cThere has been no supply or provision of food, medicine, or essential medical supplies needed to save the lives of the injured and sick in the hospital,\u201d Gaza\u2019s health ministry said, calling the situation inside \u201ccatastrophic in every sense of the word\u201d. About 770 people have been killed in Jabalia, along with other parts of the Palestinian territory\u2019s north, since the offensive was launched on 6 October, Gaza\u2019s civil defence reported. \u201cSince the start of operational activity in Jabalia, approximately 45,000 Palestinian civilians have evacuated, and IDF (Israeli army) troops have eliminated hundreds of terrorists\u201d, the Israeli military said. At least nine Palestinians were killed and several were injured on Friday in an Israeli airstrike on Al-Shati, one of the Gaza Strip\u2019s eight historic refugee camps, medics told Reuters. Peacekeepers of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon withdrew from a observation post in Zahajra town in south Lebanon on Tuesday after Israeli forces fired at it, the force said on Friday. The UN mission, known as Unifil, is stationed in southern Lebanon to monitor hostilities along the demarcation Blue Line with Israel \u2013 an area that has seen fierce clashes this month between Israeli troops and Iran-backed Hezbollah fighters. The mission said that when Israeli soldiers conducting house-clearing operations nearby realised they were being observed they fired at the post, which prompted the duty guards to withdrew to avoid being shot. It added that the Israeli military has repeatedly demanded that Unifil vacate its positions along the Blue Line and has deliberately damaged camera, lighting and communications equipment at some of these positions. Here are some of the latest images coming out of Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, where Palestinian officials said Israeli military strikes have killed at least 38 people since Thursday night: The Israeli military has confirmed reports that it had struck a border crossing between Syria and Lebanon that it claimed was being used by Hezbollah to transfer weapons. The airstrike hit Hezbollah \u201cinfrastructure\u201d at the Jousieh crossing (known as Qaa on the Lebanese side) in Lebanon\u2019s northern Bekaa area overnight, the military said. It said Hezbollah \u201cexploits the Jousieh civilian crossing, which is under the control of the Syrian regime and is operated by Syrian military security, to transfer weapons\u201d. Lebanon\u2019s transport minister Ali Hamieh said earlier that the strike had knocked the crossing out of service. This means both Lebanon\u2019s eastern crossings are closed, leaving the northern route as the only way to Syria. The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said the strikes were hindering refugees\u2019 attempts to flee. UNHCR spokesperson Rula Amin said about 430,000 people have crossed to Syria since Israel\u2019s assault on the country started. \u201cThe attacks on the border crossings are a major concern,\u201d Amin said. \u201cThey are blocking the path to safety for people fleeing conflict.\u201d Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, Najib Mikati, has reacted to the news that three journalists were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Hasbaya, south-eastern Lebanon, this morning (see post at 08.12 for more details). In a statement, he said \u201cthe new Israeli aggression targeting journalists\u201d was among the \u201cwar crimes committed by the Israeli enemy\u201d, adding that the attack was \u201cdeliberate\u201d and \u201caims to terrorise the media to cover up crimes and destruction\u201d. Those killed were camera operator Ghassan Najjar and engineer Mohamed Reda from Lebanese news channel Al Mayadeen, as well as camera operator Wissam Qassem from Al-Manar, another TV outlet. Five journalists had been killed in prior Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon, according to the BBC. Eid Sabbah, Kamal Adwan hospital\u2019s director of nursing, sent a voice note to Reuters, after Israeli forces stormed the facility. \u201cSince last night, at midnight, the occupation army tanks and bulldozers reached the hospital. The terrorising of civilians, the injured and children began as they (the Israeli army) started opening fire on the hospital,\u201d Sabbah said. He said when the army retreated, a delegation from the World Health Organisation arrived with an ambulance and evacuated 40 patients from the northern Gaza hospital. But Israeli tanks returned and opened fire on the hospital, which has run out of medical supplies, striking its oxygen stores, before raiding the building and ordering staff and patients to leave, Sabbah told Reuters. An Israeli airstrike killed at least three journalists and injured several others as they slept in guesthouses in southern Lebanon on Friday, Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said, in what Lebanon\u2019s information minister declared a war crime. The Israeli military has not yet commented on the attack. Lebanon\u2019s transport minister said Israeli bombing put a second border crossing between the country and Syria out of service - leaving one official passage between the two nations operational. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, vowed to work with \u201creal urgency\u201d for a diplomatic resolution to end Israel\u2019s war on Lebanon, but did not call for an immediate ceasefire. Blinken is in London meeting Arab leaders, including Lebanese prime minister Najib Mikati, and Jordan\u2019s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, who told him: \u201cWe do see ethnic cleansing taking place, and that has got to stop,\u201d referring to Israel\u2019s renewed assault on northern Gaza. Northern Gaza\u2019s Kamal Adwan hospital has now run out of medical supplies and the Israeli military is conducting mass arrests of men inside of the facility, Al Jazeera reported. The Associated Press reported that 38 people were killed in Israeli attacks in the southern city of Khan Younis in Gaza overnight into Friday, citing health officials. The Israeli army said five soldiers were killed and two others seriously injured in fighting in southern Lebanon. In an earlier post, we cited reporting from Palestinian news agency Wafa that said Israeli airstrikes on Khan Younis killed 28 civilians this morning. The Associated Press is reporting that 38 people were killed overnight into Friday, citing health officials. Palestinians who were killed or injured were taken to the European and Nasser Hospitals. Records from the European hospital obtained by the AP showed at least 15 members from al-Farra family were killed, including 13 children. Gaza Civil Defence spokesperson Mahmoud Bassal posted a video on Friday morning of rescuers recovering the bodies of 9 children from the al-Farra family in al-Manara neighborhood. The Israeli attack, which included airstrikes and shelling, according to health officials, targeted several residential buildings in neighborhoods east of Khan Younis. Six members of the Abdeen family were also killed, according to health officials. As we reported in an earlier post, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has met with the Lebanese prime minister, Najib Mikati, in London, as efforts to bring about a diplomatic resolution to Israel\u2019s war continue. Blinken also met with Jordan\u2019s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, who brought up the devastating Israeli offensive in northern Gaza, where many civilians have been killed and infrastructure levelled in an intense military siege by the Israeli military over recent weeks. Safadi told Blinken: \u201cWe do see ethnic cleansing taking place, and that has got to stop.\u201d Blinken is in the UK meeting Arab leaders, following a diplomatic tour of the Middle East earlier this week, his first to the region since Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, suspected mastermind of the 7 October attack last year. \u201cWe have a sense of real urgency in getting to a diplomatic resolution and the full implementation of UN security council resolution 1701, such that there can be real security along border between Israel and Lebanon,\u201d Blinken said. He was referring to the resolution that ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war and has since been the framework that governs security dynamics on the Lebanese-Israeli border. \u201cMeanwhile, we want to make sure we want to see civilians protected. We want to make sure that Lebanese armed forces are not caught in the crossfire,\u201d Blinken added. Lebanon\u2019s health minister, Firass Abiad, has told reporters that over 163 rescuers and health workers had been killed and 272 injured in Israeli airstrikes during more than a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Hezbollah, the Iranian backed Lebanese militant group, began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Palestinians on 7 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas\u2019s attack on southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed. More than 2,500 people are reported to have been killed in Lebanon since then, many of whom were civilians, including 1,900 in the past five weeks. Israel unleashed its assault on Lebanon last month, claiming its aim was to return tens of thousands of people evacuated from homes in northern Israel due to the cross-border hostilities. US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has met with Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, Najib Mikati in London. The US \u2013 Israel\u2019s biggest arms supplier \u2013 has stopped short of calling for an immediate ceasefire in Israel\u2019s month of bombing of Lebanon, but is instead calling for a diplomatic resolution. Speaking in Doha, the Qatari capital, Blinken said yesterday: We have been very clear that this cannot lead - should not lead - to a protracted campaign and that Israel must take the necessary steps to avoid civilian casualties and not endanger UN peacekeepers or the Lebanese armed forces. The US has called for Lebanon\u2019s central government to take charge of security and for the disarmament of Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shiite movement that effectively has its own military. Northern Gaza\u2019s Kamal Adwan hospital, along with the nearby Indonesian and al-Awda hospitals, have reported dire shortages of fuel and other supplies amid relentless Israeli attacks in the area over recent weeks. Sweeping evacuation orders for the hundreds of thousands people estimated to be still living in the northern third of the territory, the blockage of aid and food deliveries and the targeting of civilian infrastructure have led to accusations that Israel is committing the war crime of seeking to forcibly displace the remaining population. Al Jazeera reports that the Kamal Adwan hospital has now run out of medical supplies and its warehouse is empty. Hussam Abu Safia, director of the hospital, told Al Jazeera yesterday that most of the surgeons have been arrested by Israeli troops, meaning urgent surgeries cannot be performed. The outlet reports: Last night, the Israeli military surrounded the hospital and directly fired shells at the building causing severe damage to the ICU and the emergency department. The bombing also damaged the oxygen station and disrupted the flow of oxygen supplies to the incubators and the ICU, threatening the lives of 150 wounded people and 14 newborns. We can confirm that the Israeli military is conducting mass arrests of men inside Kamal Adwan Hospital and leading them to an unknown area for interrogation. The Israeli military targeted a group of homes on al-Hawaja Street in Jabalia refugee camp, killing and wounding many Palestinians. The Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, has explored how the deterioration in the relationship between the Israeli government and the UN could affect aid delivered by the UN relief and works agency for Palestinians (Unrwa) in the Gaza Strip: The Israeli army said five soldiers were killed and two others seriously injured in fighting in southern Lebanon. The soldiers \u201cfell during combat in southern Lebanon\u201d the previous day, the army said, bringing the total number of Israeli soldiers killed in Lebanon to 32 since 30 September. Lebanon\u2019s transport minister, Ali Hamieh, has told AFP that Israeli bombing put a second border crossing between the country and Syria out of service - leaving one official passage between the two nations operational. \u201cThe Qaa crossing has been put out of service after an Israeli strike on Syrian territory, hundreds of metres from Syrian border guards,\u201d Hamieh said. The UN said on 22 October that an airstrike on the main road at the Masnaa border crossing between Lebanon and Syria left it \u201cimpassable\u201d. The crossing was the main route for people in Lebanon to flee to Syria to escape Israeli bombardments (hundreds of thousands of people have done so). Israel\u2019s war has displaced upwards of one million people, according to Lebanese officials. Journalists from other media organisations, including Lebanese broadcaster Al-Jadeed, Sky News Arabic and Al Jazeera English, were also resting nearby when the deadly Israeli airstrike hit Hasbaya overnight, Agence France-Presse (AFP) is reporting. Lebanon\u2019s information minister, Ziad Makary, has described the Israeli attack \u2013 that reportedly killed at least three journalists as they slept in guesthouses used by media in Hasbaya, southern Lebanon \u2013 as a \u201cwar crime\u201d. In a post on X, he wrote: The Israeli enemy waited for the journalists\u2019 nighttime break to betray them in their sleep... This is an assassination, after monitoring and tracking, with prior planning and design, as there were 18 journalists there representing seven media institutions. This is a war crime. Lebanese television channel Al Mayadeen said its cameraman Ghassan Najjar, as well as broadcast engineer Mohammad Reda, were killed in the Israeli airstrike on Hasbaya. Al Mayadeen said Najjar \u201cwas a father who risked his life for a just cause, dedicated to revealing the truth, and was killed in cold blood\u201d. Another TV outlet, al-Manar, which is run by Hezbollah, said its photographer Wissam Qassem was also killed in the Israeli airstrike in Hasbaya. There are reports of an Israeli airstrike hitting the southern city of Khan Younis this morning, killing at least 28 Palestinian civilians. Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, reported that the attack, which left dozens of people injured, targeted a residential home in the al-Manara neighbourhood of the city. It was among a series of deadly attacks launched by the Israeli military across the Gaza Strip over the last day. According to Al Jazeera, Israeli forces destroyed over 10 residential buildings in Jabalia, which has become the epicentre of a renewed assault on northern Gaza over the past few weeks. Israel claims to be trying to prevent Hamas fighters from regrouping. Al Jazeera said there were \u201cmassive casualties\u201d from the attack that Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency was reported to have described as a \u201cmajor massacre\u201d. The outlet also reported that an \u201cunspecified number of children\u201d were killed after the Israeli military bombed the Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza. The Guardian has not independently verified the figures provided in either report. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of Israel\u2019s wars on Gaza and Lebanon. An Israeli airstrike early on Friday morning killed at least three media staff staying at a guesthouse in Lebanon where several other reporters were staying, Lebanese media reported. Those killed were camera operator Ghassan Najjar and engineer Mohamed Reda of the Lebanese TV channel Al-Mayadeen and camera operator Wissam Qassem, who worked for Hezbollah\u2019s Al-Manar, the outlets said in separate statements. Other reporters at the scene, in Hasbaya in southern Lebanon, said the bungalow where members of those specific outlets were sleeping was directly targeted. US secretary of state Antony Blinken is set to meet with Lebanese prime minister Najib Mikati in London on Friday, as well as with the foreign ministers of Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, two key US partners in a postwar plan for Gaza, the state department said. Blinken said he hoped Iran was getting a clear message that any further attacks on Israel risked its own interests. Israel has vowed retaliation for an Iranian missile barrage on 1 October. It comes as Israel said the chief of its Mossad intelligence agency David Barnea will travel to Doha on Sunday to meet with CIA director William Burns and Qatar\u2019s prime minister as long-stalled efforts to end the Gaza war appeared to gain some precious, if tentative, momentum. \u201cThe parties will discuss the various options for starting negotiations for the release of the hostages from Hamas captivity, against the backdrop of the latest developments,\u201d the office of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. Previous attempts to reach a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal have fallen short. A senior Hamas official told AFP that a delegation from the group\u2019s Doha-based leadership discussed \u201cideas and proposals\u201d related to a Gaza truce with Egyptian officials in Cairo on Thursday. \u201cHamas has expressed readiness to stop the fighting, but Israel must commit to a ceasefire, withdraw from the Gaza Strip, allow the return of displaced people, agree to a serious prisoner exchange deal and allow the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza,\u201d the official said. In other developments: At least 17 people, nearly all women and children, have been killed in Israeli bombing of a school turned shelter in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip, medics in the territory have said. Another 42 people were injured in the strike in the overcrowded camp, according to nearby al-Awda hospital. Among the dead were 13 children under the age of 18 and three women, it said. The strike marked the latest Israeli bombing of a school sheltering displaced people across Gaza. Israel\u2019s military said the school was being used as a Hamas command and control centre. As it braces for an expected retaliatory strike from Israel, Iran has ordered the armed forces to be prepared for war but also to try to avoid it, having witnessed the decimation of its allies in Lebanon and Gaza, the New York Times is reporting. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has ordered the military to devise multiple military plans for responding to an Israeli attack, the report says, citing four unnamed Iranian officials. The scope of any Iranian retaliation, they said, will largely depend on the severity of Israel\u2019s attacks. Several Israeli strikes hit Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs on Thursday, about half an hour after Israel issued evacuation warnings for the Hezbollah bastion after intense strikes the night before. In Beirut\u2019s southern Choueifat Al-Amrousieh area, Israeli warplanes \u201cdestroyed two buildings and ignited a large fire, and black smoke covered the area,\u201d according to the official national news agency. \u201cThe raid that targeted the Saint Therese area also caused the collapse of two buildings near the constitutional council.\u201d Israel had earlier issued evacuation warnings for the Hezbollah bastion following intense assaults the night before. Israel\u2019s military said it had killed a Hamas commander who took part in the 7 October 2023 assault on southern Israel and worked for the UN aid agency in the Gaza Strip. Unrwa confirmed the man, Mohammad Abu Itiwi, was a staff member and was killed on Wednesday. Unrwa said Itiwi\u2019s name was included in a letter received from Israel in July that included a list of 100 staff members who were also allegedly members of armed groups, including Hamas, but that Israeli authorities had not provided more information supporting those allegations. France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, warned Benjamin Netanyahu that \u201ccivilisation is not best defended by sowing barbarism ourselves\u201d. Macron also vowed to help train 6,000 extra Lebanese official forces, and called for a ceasefire and an end to Israeli attacks on UN peacekeepers, as a conference in Paris raised $200m (\u00a3154m) for Lebanon\u2019s official military and $800m in humanitarian aid for the country. Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency said on Thursday that more than 770 Palestinians have been killed in the north of the territory since Israel launched a new offensive in northern Gaza on 6 October. The agency also said it had been forced to suspend operations in northern Gaza after what it called threats from the Israeli military to \u201cbomb and kill\u201d rescue crews working in Jabalia camp. Gaza\u2019s health ministry said on Thursday that 42,847 Palestinians have been killed and 100,544 injured since Israel launched its war last year. An Israeli airstrike struck the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza on Thursday night, with Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency estimating that 150 people \u2013 including women and children \u2013 were killed or injured, the Palestinian news agency, Wafa reported.",

      "bodyText": "The Chinese military is constructing a new counter-stealth radar system on a disputed reef in the South China Sea that would significantly expand its surveillance capabilities in the region, satellite imagery suggests. Analysis by Chatham House suggests China is upgrading its outpost on Triton Island, on the south-west corner of the Paracel archipelago, building what may be a launching point for an anti-ship missile battery, as well as the sophisticated radar system. \u201cBy constraining the US ability to operate stealth aircraft, and threaten stealth aircraft, these capabilities in the South China Sea send a powerful signal to US allies and partners in the region that the US advanced technologies may not be able to stand up to the PLA (People\u2019s Liberation Army),\u201d said Michael Dahm, a senior resident fellow at the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies. Similar counter-stealth radars, known as SIAR, or synthetic impulse and aperture radar, have been built to the south, on Subi reef in the Spratly Island chain, and on Hainan Island, to the north. The construction on Triton will close a gap in its coverage. \u201cTriton Island is another brick in the wall,\u201d said Dahm, who added China has for three decades been building technologies to protect against the advanced stealth capabilities of the US. Triton, a reef about 120ha in size, lies in the farthest south-west corner of the Paracels, an archipelago that has been controlled by China since a violent conflict with Vietnam in 1974. It is also claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam. China claims much of the South China Sea as its own, despite an international tribunal judgment rejecting its arguments. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have overlapping claims in the strategic waterway. The US is not a claimant but says the key trade route is crucial to its national interest, and it often conducts freedom of navigation operations through the area. It has a mutual defence treaty with Manila and has pledged to defend the Philippines from an attack in the South China Sea. Over the past two years China has repeatedly been accused of aggressive behaviour in the waters, with analysts warning such confrontations risk spiraling into conflict. Earlier this month Vietnam accused Chinese law enforcement personnel of assaulting 10 Vietnamese fishers and seizing about four tonnes of fish catch in an incident near the Paracel Islands. The islands are not only rich fishing grounds, but also contain oil and gas reserves. Any construction on Triton \u2013 which lies 135 nautical miles east of Vietnam\u2019s mainland, and 170 nautical miles south of China\u2019s Hainan \u2013 is likely to be of concern to Hanoi. According to Chatham House\u2019s analysis the intelligence structures on Triton would \u201csignificantly diminish [Vietnam\u2019s] capacity to operate undetected in the area\u201d. \u201cAlongside existing radar on Triton which can detect sea-going vessels, Beijing now has the potential to track Vietnamese air movements and gain forewarning of Hanoi\u2019s manoeuvres in the area, including efforts to access oil and gas deposits,\u201d it said. The radar may also complicate attempts by the US, British and Australian navies to navigate in the surrounding waters, it added. Chatham House suggests there are several building projects on Triton. These include a large pad at the end of a road network, which may be used as a launching point for a mobile anti-ship missile battery, while another building, visible on satellite imagery, may be used as a storage facility for missile transport vehicles. Such construction work marked efforts to shore up the south-western edge of the Paracels, according to Dahm. \u201cTriton Island really represents the weak point in the fortress,\u201d said Dahm, who added China had already build significant capabilities on Woody Island and on other reefs in the north-east of the archipelago.",
