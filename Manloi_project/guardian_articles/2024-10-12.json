Beterbiev is moving straight ahead, throwing and landing more shots as Bivol conjures every ounce of technique to block, parry and generally fend off a determined opponent with power combinations. A very close round to end a very close, high-level match between two elite competitors.

Beterbiev\u2019s power shots have finally broken through and Bivol is taking an alarming volume of punches. Bivol is moving backwards, visibly fatigues, as Beterbiev stalks forward and lands blows in combination. Bivol tries to tie up his foe in vain and is left in survival mode until the bell. The best round of the fight for Beterbiev, easily. Three more minutes.</p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Beterbiev 10-9 Bivol (Beterbiev 104-105 Bivol)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-670afb2a8f081a18004e5824\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-12T22:42:00.784Z\">11.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 10</strong></p> <p>Bivol\u2019s disciplined defense and technical skill are on full display. He\u2019s landing the crisper shots while nearly all of Beterbiev\u2019s shots are failing to reach the target, mostly landing in Bivol\u2019s gloves. Beterbiev finished the frame strong but it wasn\u2019t enough to swing the round. </p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Beterbiev 9-10 Bivol (Beterbiev 94-96 Bivol)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-670afa608f081a18004e5820\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-12T22:38:31.804Z\">11.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 9</strong></p> <p>An excellent round by Bivol right when it felt like things were slipping away. Bivol returns to boxing behind that jab and using lateral movement and feints to keep the hard-hitting Beterbiev off balance. Now it\u2019s Beterbiev who is starting to look a little discouraged with three rounds to go. </p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Beterbiev 9-10 Bivol (Beterbiev 85-86 Bivol)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-670af9788f081a18004e581d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-12T22:35:00.451Z\">11.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 8</strong></p> <p>More constant pressure from Beterbiev, finding ways to penetrate his foe\u2019s high guard. Bivol is slowing down and appears to be taking the round off. He tries to steal it in the last 15 seconds, firing off about a dozen unanswered punches, all of which are swallowed up by Beterbiev\u2019s guard.</p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Beterbiev 10-9 Bivol (Beterbiev 76-76 Bivol)</strong></p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-12T23:24:55.093Z\">at 12.24am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-670af8788f08e1594c64bbea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-12T22:30:33.170Z\">11.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 7</strong></p> <p>A promising start to the seventh for Bivol, who returns to the formula that was working so well for him in the early rounds. Bivol then catches Beterbiev with a left hand flush to the jaw on the back end of a one-two combination. And Beterbiev looks hurt! Bivol is chasing down the puncher. But he overcommits and Beterbiev swings the action back in his favor, trapping Bivol against the ropes and opening up. He\u2019s lucky the bell sounded when it did. Close round to score but Beterbiev nicks it here. </p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Beterbiev 10-9 Bivol (Beterbiev 66-67 Bivol)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-670af7928f08e1594c64bbe7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-12T22:26:30.998Z\">11.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 6</strong></p> <p>Beterbiev is starting to catch up to Bivol along the ropes more and more often, landing a couple of thudding shots the appear to visibly slow him down. Bivol under intense mental and physical duress at the moment as the hard-charging Beterbiev looks to turn the tide. </p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Beterbiev 10-9 Bivol (Beterbiev 56-58 Bivol)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-670af6c88f08e1594c64bbdc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-12T22:23:46.970Z\">11.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 5</strong></p> <p>Beterbiev continues to chart improvement, throwing more punches than Bivol with most of them landing on the younger man\u2019s guard. Beterbiev is relentless in there, in full seek-and-destroy mode and fighting downhill as Bivol continues to jab and counter off the back foot. Bivol lands a crunching left hook with about a half-minute to go but Beterbiev finishes the round with a flurry of activity, doing just enough to shade the round on our card. </p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Beterbiev 10-9 Bivol (Beterbiev 46-49 Bivol)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-670af5ce8f087ed1d5a8a4f4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-12T22:19:00.183Z\">11.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 4</strong></p> <p>Beterbiev\u2019s plodding, unsparing pressure not quite enough to offset Bivol\u2019s workrate and effectiveness with the jab, but he\u2019s closing the distance incrementally. Another round for Bivol but this will be the test of a lifetime for his stamina and endurance if he\u2019s to keep this up for the scheduled 12 rounds, especially as Beterbiev begins to find a home for his jab.</p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Beterbiev 9-10 Bivol (Beterbiev 36-40 Bivol)</strong></p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-12T23:25:56.511Z\">at 12.25am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-670af4be8f081a18004e580d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-12T22:14:29.905Z\">11.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 3</strong></p> <p>More of the same from Bivol, who is countering beautifully but also opening up and landing some hard shots in combination. But Beterbiev is doing a better job of closing the distance, moving Bivol closer to the ropes with educated pressure and landing punishing blows of his down. Bivol nicks the round but Beterbiev, traditionally a slow starter, is very much in this fight.</p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Beterbiev 9-10 Bivol (Beterbiev 27-30 Bivol)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-670af39c8f08e1594c64bbcf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-12T22:10:06.823Z\">11.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 2</strong></p> <p>Beterbiev is doing more to dictate the pace early in the second, forcing the issue and trying to disrupt his opponent from settling into a rhythm. But Bivol is boxing beautifully with the jab, maintaining distance, using lateral movement and scoring points with crisp counters. According to Compubox\u2019s punch statistics, Bivol is outlanding Beterbiev <a href=\"https://x.com/CompuBox/status/1845225033876058259\">by a 26-11 edge</a>.</p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Beterbiev 9-10 Bivol (Beterbiev 18-20 Bivol)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-670af29b8f08e1594c64bbcb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-12T22:05:21.020Z\">11.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 1</strong></p> <p>There\u2019s the bell! Bivol throws the first blow, firing the left jab to keep Beterbiev. Beterbiev on the front foot, looking to counter-punch. Bivol is looking to maintain the distance. After a minute it\u2019s largely a feeling-out round, but a tense one! Bivol is doing more behind the jab, enough to win the first, but both men open up near the end of the frame with Bivol showing he\u2019s not afraid to exchange in the pocket. </p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Beterbiev 9-10 Bivol (Beterbiev 9-10 Bivol)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-670af13c8f08e1594c64bbc5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-12T21:59:50.252Z\">10.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The fighters have been announced by ring announcer Michael Buffer.</strong> The final instructions have been given by referee Thomas Taylor the seconds are out and we\u2019ll pick it up with round-by-round coverage from here!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-670af07f8f081a18004e57f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-12T21:57:05.263Z\">10.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The fighters are making their ringwalks.</strong> First it\u2019s Artur Beterbiev, in a spartan kit of white T-shirt and red trunks, approaching the ring at a full canter as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33CD7NMlrLo\">Rizavdi Ismailov\u2019s \u0412\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434 \u0410\u0445\u043c\u0430\u0442</a> plays from the arena soundsystem.

It looks like a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/apr/24/how-jackson-pollock-spattered-his-way-to-fame\">Jackson Pollock painting</a> where blood rather than paint has been sprayed and splashed across the canvas. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that photo,\u201d he says, \u201cand it definitely tells a story and shows the reality of our sport.</p> <p>\u201cI love boxing but it\u2019s dangerous and I have a beautiful family who come first.

There are blockbusters. And there are events like this one which promise to define an era. Tonight\u2019s long-awaited showdown between two unbeaten veterans of the ring and former Russian amateur teammates not simply a delicious clash of styles, but promises to determine generational supremecy in the 175lbs division.</p> <p>Beterbiev (20-0, 20 KO), the WBC, IBF and WBO light heavyweight champion, is a Russian-born Canadian knockout artist known for his relentless pressure and devastating power. Bivol (23-0, 12 KO), the Kyrgyzstan-born and California-based technician who holds the WBA strap, is better known for deft counter-punching, disciplined defense and ring intelligence. (Ask <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/08/dmitry-bivol-canelo-alvarez-fight-upset\">Canelo \u00c1lvarez</a>.)</p> <p>Bivol will look to neutralize Beterbiev\u2019s pressure by maintaining distance, using lateral movement and scoring with crisp jabs and counters. Beterbiev will aim to close the distance, cut off the ring and impose his power with in-fighting and body work. The outcome could hinge on who can impose their style on the other.</p> <p>The main event should kick off in about two hours\u2019 time. Plenty more to come between now and then.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-670acd5b8f087ed1d5a8a449\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-12T19:56:52.342Z\">8.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Bryan will be here shortly.</strong> In the meantime here\u2019s a look at Friday\u2019s weigh-ins, where Beterbiev (174.9lbs) and Bivol (174.12lbs) both came in narrowly under the division limit. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JAUkzuTWM8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_JAUkzuTWM8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Beterbiev and Bivol both made weight after of Saturday\u2019s hotly anticipated light heavyweight title fight. </figcaption> </figure>  </div>   </div>",

Thanks for following along with us and be sure to check out the full fight report here. \u201cI have to do everything perfect,\u201d Bivol says afterward. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have any explanation because it could look like excuses. I just ... Congratulations to Artur and his team. He deserves it.\u201d Bivol is asked if he felt Beterbiev\u2019s power at any point during the fight. He gestures to the ample bruising around his eyes, but notes that most of them came from his own gloves as he blocked his opponent\u2019s offerings. \u201cHe\u2019s powerful,\u201d he says. \u201cVery powerful. And you see, I have a bruise from my from my hand. [His punching] was so hard, even he reached my eye.\u201d Would he want to fight a rematch? \u201cWhy not? Of course,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I had this chance, yes. This is my dream to be undisputed.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I didn\u2019t like this fight,\u201d Beterbiev tells the in-ring interviewer. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be better one day.\u201d From there he\u2019s mostly short and to the point. Was it a tough fight? \u201cIt\u2019s not tough,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a little bit uncomfortable. He is world champion, too. He has good skills. But today, Allah chose me.\u201d What changes did he make during the fight? \u201cDuring the fight, we always try to change something,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to punch him. Maybe that\u2019s why I delivered more punches. I don\u2019t know.\u201d How does it feel to go the distance for the first time after knocking out 20 straight opponents to start his career? \u201cIt\u2019s a new experience,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m happy that for that. Even Muhammad Ali have fights [that went the] full distance. I\u2019m not a bad boxer.\u201d Beterbiev is the undisputed light heavyweight champion of world after winning a majority decision. Two judges handed down scores of 116-112 and 115-113 for Beterbiev while the other had it 114-114 (as did the Guardian). Round 12 Bivol looked completely tapped out by the end of the 11th round and he doesn\u2019t look much better at the start of the 12th. Beterbiev is moving straight ahead, throwing and landing more shots as Bivol conjures every ounce of technique to block, parry and generally fend off a determined opponent with power combinations. A very close round to end a very close, high-level match between two elite competitors. Wonderful stuff. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Beterbiev 10-9 Bivol (Beterbiev 114-114 Bivol) Round 11 What a fight! Beterbiev\u2019s power shots have finally broken through and Bivol is taking an alarming volume of punches. Bivol is moving backwards, visibly fatigues, as Beterbiev stalks forward and lands blows in combination. Bivol tries to tie up his foe in vain and is left in survival mode until the bell. The best round of the fight for Beterbiev, easily. Three more minutes. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Beterbiev 10-9 Bivol (Beterbiev 104-105 Bivol) Round 10 Bivol\u2019s disciplined defense and technical skill are on full display. He\u2019s landing the crisper shots while nearly all of Beterbiev\u2019s shots are failing to reach the target, mostly landing in Bivol\u2019s gloves. Beterbiev finished the frame strong but it wasn\u2019t enough to swing the round. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Beterbiev 9-10 Bivol (Beterbiev 94-96 Bivol) Round 9 An excellent round by Bivol right when it felt like things were slipping away. Bivol returns to boxing behind that jab and using lateral movement and feints to keep the hard-hitting Beterbiev off balance. Now it\u2019s Beterbiev who is starting to look a little discouraged with three rounds to go. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Beterbiev 9-10 Bivol (Beterbiev 85-86 Bivol) Round 8 More constant pressure from Beterbiev, finding ways to penetrate his foe\u2019s high guard. Bivol is slowing down and appears to be taking the round off. He tries to steal it in the last 15 seconds, firing off about a dozen unanswered punches, all of which are swallowed up by Beterbiev\u2019s guard. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Beterbiev 10-9 Bivol (Beterbiev 76-76 Bivol) Round 7 A promising start to the seventh for Bivol, who returns to the formula that was working so well for him in the early rounds. Bivol then catches Beterbiev with a left hand flush to the jaw on the back end of a one-two combination. And Beterbiev looks hurt! Bivol is chasing down the puncher. But he overcommits and Beterbiev swings the action back in his favor, trapping Bivol against the ropes and opening up. He\u2019s lucky the bell sounded when it did. Close round to score but Beterbiev nicks it here. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Beterbiev 10-9 Bivol (Beterbiev 66-67 Bivol) Round 6 Beterbiev is starting to catch up to Bivol along the ropes more and more often, landing a couple of thudding shots the appear to visibly slow him down. Bivol under intense mental and physical duress at the moment as the hard-charging Beterbiev looks to turn the tide. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Beterbiev 10-9 Bivol (Beterbiev 56-58 Bivol) Round 5 Beterbiev continues to chart improvement, throwing more punches than Bivol with most of them landing on the younger man\u2019s guard. Beterbiev is relentless in there, in full seek-and-destroy mode and fighting downhill as Bivol continues to jab and counter off the back foot. Bivol lands a crunching left hook with about a half-minute to go but Beterbiev finishes the round with a flurry of activity, doing just enough to shade the round on our card. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Beterbiev 10-9 Bivol (Beterbiev 46-49 Bivol) Round 4 Beterbiev\u2019s plodding, unsparing pressure not quite enough to offset Bivol\u2019s workrate and effectiveness with the jab, but he\u2019s closing the distance incrementally. Another round for Bivol but this will be the test of a lifetime for his stamina and endurance if he\u2019s to keep this up for the scheduled 12 rounds, especially as Beterbiev begins to find a home for his jab. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Beterbiev 9-10 Bivol (Beterbiev 36-40 Bivol) Round 3 More of the same from Bivol, who is countering beautifully but also opening up and landing some hard shots in combination. But Beterbiev is doing a better job of closing the distance, moving Bivol closer to the ropes with educated pressure and landing punishing blows of his down. Bivol nicks the round but Beterbiev, traditionally a slow starter, is very much in this fight. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Beterbiev 9-10 Bivol (Beterbiev 27-30 Bivol) Round 2 Beterbiev is doing more to dictate the pace early in the second, forcing the issue and trying to disrupt his opponent from settling into a rhythm. But Bivol is boxing beautifully with the jab, maintaining distance, using lateral movement and scoring points with crisp counters. According to Compubox\u2019s punch statistics, Bivol is outlanding Beterbiev by a 26-11 edge. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Beterbiev 9-10 Bivol (Beterbiev 18-20 Bivol) Round 1 There\u2019s the bell! Bivol throws the first blow, firing the left jab to keep Beterbiev. Beterbiev on the front foot, looking to counter-punch. Bivol is looking to maintain the distance. After a minute it\u2019s largely a feeling-out round, but a tense one! Bivol is doing more behind the jab, enough to win the first, but both men open up near the end of the frame with Bivol showing he\u2019s not afraid to exchange in the pocket. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Beterbiev 9-10 Bivol (Beterbiev 9-10 Bivol) The fighters have been announced by ring announcer Michael Buffer. The final instructions have been given by referee Thomas Taylor the seconds are out and we\u2019ll pick it up with round-by-round coverage from here! The fighters are making their ringwalks. First it\u2019s Artur Beterbiev, in a spartan kit of white T-shirt and red trunks, approaching the ring at a full canter as Rizavdi Ismailov\u2019s \u0412\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434 \u0410\u0445\u043c\u0430\u0442 plays from the arena soundsystem. Now it\u2019s Dmitry Bivol\u2019s turn and he\u2019s making his way to the squared circle at a similarly frenetic pace. Both of these guys can\u2019t wait to get started. A quick pause for the national anthem of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Michael Buffer is moving forward with the introductions. Not much longer now. Ciara, Busta Rhymes and Missy Elliott have taken the stage. From a production standpoint it\u2019s at least on par with a Grey Cup half-time show if not the Super Bowl. The 15-minute spectacular is closed by Missy\u2019s Lose Control with the newly minted Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Famer earning the highest marks of the three by some distance. The fighters should be making their entrances in the next few minutes. Timings update! Top Rank Promotions has announced that US television coverage of tonight\u2019s main event on ESPN+ will now begin at 5.30pm ET \u2013 five minutes from now \u2013 instead of 6pm as originally scheduled. Remember: there\u2019s a concert spectacular featuring Ciara, Busta Rhymes and Missy Elliott before we even think about the fighter entrances. What a time to be alive. The broadcasters for tonight\u2019s main event are spinning their wheels with 40 minutes to go until the main event. DAZN has just brought on Wardley\u2019s promoter, Queensberry supremo Frank Warren, who said that Clarke suffered a fractured cheekbone in the co-main. \u201cI went into that first fight with a lot of background stuff, a lot of things,\u201d Wardley said after tonight\u2019s stunning first-round TKO. \u201cWe got them fixed up. We got the game plan right. We put it together [and] executed on the night. \u201cSometimes, war is needed. Sometimes a little bit of brains is needed. But I took enough assessment from the first fight to know, like I said in all of the interviews, I had success in that war mode. We just needed to cuten it a little bit. We just needed to be a little bit sweeter, put it together a little bit nicer, set things up a little bit better, disguise them a little bit better. But look, I can\u2019t help it. War by name, war by nature. \u201cOnce I have my enemies hurt, there\u2019s there\u2019s no help for them unless that bell comes. That\u2019s the only thing that will save you.\u201d Asked what he wants next, the 29-year-old is to the point. \u201cI want belts, I want titles,\u201d he says. \u201cThese look great and stuff, but I want the ones that say \u2018world champion\u2019. Whoever else is hunting them, we\u2019re going to have to meet here.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at how Beterbiev and Bivol measure up ahead of tonight\u2019s main event. Physically, there\u2019s not much to separate these former Russian amateur teammates: Beterbiev has the slightest of advantages in reach while Bivol has an even scanter edge in height. Both came in just beneath the light heavyweight division limit of 175lbs at yesterday\u2019s weigh-in. A sensational first-round knockout in the co-main event at Riyadh\u2019s Kingdom Arena. Wardley detonates a concussive overhand right hand on Clarke\u2019s jaw that badly hurts the Tokyo Olympic bronze medalist near the end of the opening frame, then unloads until Clarke goes to the canvas in a heap. Clarke makes it to his feet but he\u2019s simply not there and referee Victor Loughlin correctly waves it off. That means there will be a nearly hour-and-a-half wait until the main event, which cannot begin until 1pm local time (11pm in London, 6pm in New York). Frazer Clarke has made his way into the ring for his British and Commonwealth heavyweight title bout with Fabio Wardley. It\u2019s a rematch of their gripping encounter from March, which ended in a draw. This one could very well steal the show. Our Donald McRae spoke with Clarke in the run-up. \u201cI wanted to have breakfast with the British title over my lap \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t there. People don\u2019t understand my life and the sacrifices I make, the time I can\u2019t spend with my loved ones, my kids who I missed taking their first steps or saying their first words because I was away at a training camp. People never understand how hard it is to be a boxer.\u201d I show Clarke a photograph of the canvas after his fight with Wardley. It looks like a Jackson Pollock painting where blood rather than paint has been sprayed and splashed across the canvas. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that photo,\u201d he says, \u201cand it definitely tells a story and shows the reality of our sport. \u201cI love boxing but it\u2019s dangerous and I have a beautiful family who come first. That photograph is a little reminder that you don\u2019t want it to be your blood. But I\u2019m human and I wouldn\u2019t want to do any lasting damage to anyone.\u201d Wardley admitted that such fights can take years off a boxer\u2019s career. \u201cIn some cases, definitely,\u201d Clarke agrees. \u201cYou want an exciting fight but you don\u2019t ever want one like that.\u201d Clarke then grins helplessly. \u201cBut we\u2019re fighters and so, in a strange way, I enjoyed it. Then when you look back you think: \u2018Bloody hell!\u2019 A lot of people ask: \u2018How do you do it?\u2019 The honest answer is I don\u2019t know.\u201d When the draw was announced, Clarke looked more disappointed than Wardley. \u201cI knew it was close but a draw was devastating. Still, Fabio and I had a few words full of respect in the changing room. I thanked him because he brought the best out of me. \u201cIt was a really emotional night but there was a beautiful moment when I walked into the bar at the Intercontinental, at the O2, to a standing ovation from 300 people. Everyone wanted to buy me a drink. People were singing my name. Fabio walks in two minutes later to silence. That spoke volumes.\u201d His Excellency Turki Alalshikh has taken the stage to give away a Mercedes G-Wagon. He hits a big red button and the cameras eventually train on to a woman in hijab seated in the north grandstand. Kool &amp; The Gang\u2019s Celebration blasts from the arena soundsystem as she makes her way to the floor to receive the keys. It sure beats the T-shirt cannon! Jai Opetaia has just stopped Britain\u2019s Jack Massey after Masse\u2019s corner threw in the towel during the sixth round. The 29-year-old Sydneysider has successfully defended his IBF cruiserweight title and it leaves only one more undercard bout: Frazer Clarke and Fabio Wardley for the British and Commonwealth heavyweight title. After that, Beterbiev and Bivol will make their entrances. Hello and welcome to Riyadh\u2019s Kingdom Arena for tonight\u2019s summit meeting between Artur Beterbiev and Dmitry Bivol. There are big fights. There are blockbusters. And there are events like this one which promise to define an era. Tonight\u2019s long-awaited showdown between two unbeaten veterans of the ring and former Russian amateur teammates not simply a delicious clash of styles, but promises to determine generational supremecy in the 175lbs division. Beterbiev (20-0, 20 KO), the WBC, IBF and WBO light heavyweight champion, is a Russian-born Canadian knockout artist known for his relentless pressure and devastating power. Bivol (23-0, 12 KO), the Kyrgyzstan-born and California-based technician who holds the WBA strap, is better known for deft counter-punching, disciplined defense and ring intelligence. (Ask Canelo \u00c1lvarez.) Bivol will look to neutralize Beterbiev\u2019s pressure by maintaining distance, using lateral movement and scoring with crisp jabs and counters. Beterbiev will aim to close the distance, cut off the ring and impose his power with in-fighting and body work. The outcome could hinge on who can impose their style on the other. The main event should kick off in about two hours\u2019 time. Plenty more to come between now and then. Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s a look at Friday\u2019s weigh-ins, where Beterbiev (174.9lbs) and Bivol (174.12lbs) both came in narrowly under the division limit.",

The 39-year-old Beterbiev (21-0, 20 KOs) had won all 20 of his previous fights by knockout but was forced the distance by his fellow Russian rival in Riyadh in the early hours of Sunday morning in a fight that had several swings of momentum and was almost too close to call. In the end, two ringside judges scored it 115-113, 116-112 for Beterbiev, with a third judge scoring it as a 114-114 draw. (The Guardian had it 114-114.) The headline clash at the Saudi capital\u2019s Kingdom Arena, postponed from June after Montreal-based Beterbiev suffered a knee injury, put all four major world titles \u2013 WBO, WBA, IBF and WBC \u2013 in the hands of one man for the first time. The last undisputed light-heavyweight champion was the Russian-American Roy Jones Jr who beat Reggie Johnson to unify the WBA, WBC and IBF belts in 1999. Bivol made himself a moving target in a high-quality fight between the big punching and aggressive Beterbiev and a more fluid rival who landed eye-catching early blows and had the better of the early rounds. There was little between the two at the half-way point, with Beterbiev possibly behind but every round a close call in a fight short of fireworks but with plenty for the purists. Beterbiev knew he had to close with a bang in the last two rounds and raised the tempo but Bivol hung in there and fired back some powerful combinations. \u201cI just congratulate Artur and his team, he deserves it,\u201d said Bivol, looking forward also to a possible rematch. \u201cI did my job, I felt I could do better, I always feel I can do better, but that\u2019s the opinion of the judges. He won.\u201d Australia\u2019s Jai Opetaia earlier retained his IBF cruiserweight world title when Jack Massey\u2019s corner threw in the towel two minutes into the sixth round with the beaten Briton bleeding from a cut to the side of his nose. The convincing win took Opetaia\u2019s record to 26-0. Unbeaten Australian Skye Nicolson won the first women\u2019s world title fight held in Saudi Arabia when she defended her WBC featherweight belt against Britain\u2019s Raven Chapman in a unanimous points decision. A light heavyweight fight between Britons Ben Whittaker and Liam Cameron ended in a draw after both crashed out of the ring, while Fabio Wardley stopped Frazer Clarke in the first round of their British heavyweight title fight.",

      "bodyText": "This blog has now closed. You can read all our coverage of the Israel-Gaza war here and Israel\u2019s invasion of Lebanon here. Sixteen patients from Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza have been evacuated in a \u201ccomplex mission\u201d that lasted 12 hours, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has said. Fourteen of the patients\u2019 friends or family members were also successfully evacuated. Israeli forces ordered staff and patients to evacuate the hospital, threatening them with arrest if they did not comply, according to the Palestinian health ministry. There has been an updated death toll. At least 15 people were killed and 37 wounded in Israeli strikes across three areas in Lebanon, the Lebanese health ministry said. One of the targeted locations was in the town of Deir Billa in northern Lebanon, which had not been struck before, Reuters reports. Here\u2019s a look at where things stand: The African Union has joined 104 UN member states in issuing a joint letter of support for UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres after Israel declared him persona non grata. In the letter, the UN member states wrote: \u201cSuch actions undermine the United Nations\u2019 ability to carry out its mandate, which includes mediating conflicts and providing humanitarian support.\u201d Thirty-four Unifil-contributing countries have signed a joint statement reaffirming the protection of Unifil peacekeepers in Lebanon and condemning the latest attacks against them. The letter, which was initiated by Poland, comes after five peacekeepers in Lebanon were wounded in recent days amid Israel\u2019s attacks on the country. Israeli raids on al-al-Maaysra, in the Keserwan district, in Lebanon have killed at least nine people while wounding 15 others, the Lebanese health ministry announced. The health ministry added that in Deir Bella, Batroun, Israeli attacks have killed at least two people and injured four others. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society evacuated 16 patients and 14 of their companions from Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza to al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. The mission, which lasted 12 hours, comes as Israel expands its deadly invasion into north Gaza. In recent days, Israeli strikes have killed dozens of Palestinians sheltering in north Gaza, including 22 people in the area\u2019s Jabalia refugee camp. UN peacekeepers will remain in south Lebanon, despite five of their members being wounded amid Israeli airstrikes on the country. In a statement to Agence France-Presse on Saturday, Andrea Tenenti, spokesperson for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil), said that despite Israel\u2019s request to Unifil to withdraw from positions \u201cup to five kilometers from the blue line\u201d, the peacekeepers refused. Israeli airstrikes have forced 40% of students from their homes in Lebanon, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported on Friday. Additionally, more than 60% of public schools in the country are being used as shelters. Israeli attacks on Lebanon have killed 2,255 people while wounding 10,524 more since Israel launched its attacks on the country several weeks ago, the Lebanese health ministry reported on Saturday. The rising death toll also comes amid Israel\u2019s forced displacement of 1.2 million people in Lebanon, approximately a quarter of the country\u2019s population. Here are some images coming through the newswires from Lebanon, where Israeli forces have killed more than 2,000 people in recent weeks while forcibly displacing 1.2 million people across the country: Gazans who escaped and the diaspora community in Australia spoke to the Guardian of the anguish and guilt of watching a year-long war from afar. The Guardian\u2019s Rafqa Touma and Mostafa Rachwani report: Asmaa Elkhaldi was waking up early to pray. It was a Saturday. Light spilled through the windows of her apartment in Gaza\u2019s north. Then came the sounds of rockets and everything was on fire. Elkhaldi and her husband fled, taking only a laptop and key documents. Later \u201cthe whole building was flattened to the earth without any notification\u201d, she says from south-western Sydney where she now lives. \u201cSome of our neighbours were killed.\u201d Elkhaldi has been in Australia since November. \u201cI still feel it very vividly,\u201d she says this week, almost a year after fleeing her homeland. \u201cMy body has this kind of trauma and I feel there is going to be a bombardment any time.\u201d Being in Sydney, she says, is at times \u201cmore painful than being in Gaza\u201d. There, at least, \u201cwatching the genocide with your family or friends \u2026 you know they\u2019re safe. \u2026 \u201cWhen you are in another country, another continent, your mind can trick you, your worries can exaggerate or can drive you crazy.\u201d For the full story, click here: The African Union has joined 104 UN member states in issuing a joint letter of support for UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres after Israel declared him persona non grata. In the letter, the UN member states wrote: We \u2026 express our deep concern with and condemnation of the recent statement from the minister of foreign affairs of Israel declaring the secretary general persona non grata. Such actions undermine the United Nations\u2019 ability to carry out its mandate, which includes mediating conflicts and providing humanitarian support. Among the countries absent from the signatories are the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. \u201cPersona non grata\u201d is a legal term indicating a country\u2019s refusal to allow a diplomat from entering that country as a diplomat. Israeli raids on al-Maaysra, in the Keserwan district in Lebanon, have killed nine people while wounding 15 others, the Lebanese health ministry announced. The health ministry added that in Deir Bella, Batroun, Israeli attacks have killed two people and injured four others. Additional body parts found in the area of the attacks are undergoing DNA testing to identify the other victims. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society evacuated 16 patients and 14 of their companions from Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza to al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. The mission, which lasted 12 hours, comes as Israel expands its deadly invasion into north Gaza. In recent days, Israeli strikes have killed dozens of Palestinians sheltering in north Gaza, including 22 people in the area\u2019s Jabalia refugee camp. In the last year, Israeli forces have killed more than 42,000 Palestinians while forcibly displacing nearly 2 million survivors across the narrow strip. In addition to targeting healthcare workers and ambulances, Israel has destroyed dozens of hospitals. As of September, only 17 of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals remain partially functional as surviving healthcare workers attempt to treat deluges of patients amid overwhelmed and poorly equipped hospital systems. 34 Unifil-contributing countries have signed a joint statement reaffirming the protection of Unifil peacekeepers in Lebanon and condemning the latest attacks against them. The letter, which was initiated by Poland, comes after five peacekeepers in Lebanon were wounded in recent days amid Israel\u2019s attacks on the country. \u201cWe consider UNIFIL\u2019s role as particularly crucial in light of the escalating situation in the region. We therefore strongly condemn recent attacks on UNIFIL peacekeepers. Such actions must stop immediately and should be adequately investigated,\u201d the letter said. At least 22 people have been killed in airstrikes in northern Gaza, with Israeli forces stepping up their campaign on the besieged Palestinian territory even as fighting in the new war in Lebanon escalates. The Guardian\u2019s Bethan McKernan reports: On Saturday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) renewed its evacuation orders for Palestinians still living in the decimated northern half of Gaza, although many residents say the fighting and Israeli sniper fire make it impossible to leave. Avichay Adraee, an IDF spokesperson, told people that the area includes parts of Gaza City\u2019s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood and sections around Jabalia, the urban refugee camp. In a social media post, Adraee asked people living there to head south to al-Mawasi, a coastal area of southern Gaza where hundreds of thousands of people are already displaced. A total of 84% of the territory is currently under evacuation orders, pushing civilians into ever-dwindling \u201chumanitarian zones\u201d which Israel has bombed regardless. For the full story, click here: Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, released the following statement surrounding reports that Israeli forces attacked a Unifil tower in Lebanon: The United States is deeply concerned about reports that Israeli forces fired on positions and a tower used by @UNIFIL peacekeepers in Lebanon. While Israel is conducting targeted operations near the Blue Line to destroy Hizballah infrastructure, it is critical its forces do not threaten the safety and security of UN peacekeepers. UNIFIL must be able to operate freely and in accordance with its mandate and UN peacekeepers must never be the target of an attack. The Blue Line is a UN-established demarcation that divides Lebanon from Israel and the Golan Heights. Despite five peacekeepers having been wounded in the last few days as Israel expands its attacks across Lebanon, UNIFIL said that it will not remove its peacekeepers from the country. This blog post has been updated to correct that five peacekeepers have been wounded, not killed. UN peacekeepers will remain in south Lebanon, despite five of their members being wounded amid Israeli airstrikes on the country. In a statement to Agence France-Presse on Saturday, Andrea Tenenti, spokesperson for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil), said that despite Israel\u2019s request to Unifil to withdraw from positions \u201cup to five kilometers from the Blue Line\u201d, the peacekeepers refused. \u201cThere was a unanimous decision to stay because it\u2019s important for the UN flag to still fly high in this region, and to be able to report to the Security Council,\u201d Tenenti said. In the last two days, five peacekeepers wounded by gunfire in what Tenenti warned was becoming a \u201ca regional conflict with catastrophic impact for everyone\u201d. Meanwhile, Irish president Michael Higgins, whose country has troops in Lebanon, said Israel \u201cdemanding that the entire Unifil operating under UN mandates walk away\u201d was \u201coutrageous\u201d. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon has released the following statement on Saturday regarding one of its peacekeepers: Last night, a peacekeeper at UNIFIL\u2019s headquarters in Naqoura was hit by gunfire due to ongoing military activity nearby. He underwent surgery at our Naqoura hospital to remove the bullet and is currently stable. We do not yet know the origin of the fire.\u201d It added that one of its buildings in Ramyah \u201csustained significant damage due to explosions from nearby shelling\u201d. Israeli airstrikes have forced 40% of students from their homes in Lebanon, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported on Friday. Additionally, more than 60% of public schools in the country are being used as shelters. Israeli attacks on Lebanon have killed 2,255 people while wounding 10,524 more since Israel launched its attacks on the country several weeks ago, the Lebanese health ministry reported on Saturday. The rising death toll also comes amid Israel\u2019s forced displacement of 1.2 million people in Lebanon, approximately a quarter of the country\u2019s population. In addition to civilians, at least 28 healthcare workers have been killed in Lebanon, the World Health Organization said last week. Israeli forces have also targeted UN peacekeepers in Lebanon this week, prompting the UN to release a statement saying: We remind the IDF and all actors of their obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and property and to respect the inviolability of UN premises at all times. Since Israel launched its war on Gaza last October and most recently Lebanon, nearly 300 humanitarian aid workers, with more than two-thirds being UN staff, have been killed during the conflict. In May, Human Rights Watch released a report stating that Israeli forces are attacking known aid worker locations in the region. \u201cThis pattern of attacks despite proper notification of Israeli authorities raises serious questions about Israel\u2019s commitment and capacity to comply with international humanitarian law, which some countries, including the UK, rely on to continue to license arms exports that end up in Israel,\u201d the HRW added. It has just gone 6pm in Gaza, Tel Aviv and Beirut. Here are the latest developments so far today: The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) said on Saturday that unknown gunfire a day earlier hit a peacekeeper, the fifth wounded in south Lebanon near the Israeli border in just two days. \u201cLast night, a peacekeeper at Unifil\u2019s headquarters\u201d in Naqura \u201cwas hit by gunfire due to ongoing military activity nearby \u2026 We do not yet know the origin of the fire,\u201d a statement said, adding that the peacekeeper was \u201cstable\u201d. A spokesperson for UN peacekeepers in Lebanon on Saturday said that Israel had requested it leave its positions in south Lebanon where Israel is clashing with Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, but they had refused. They asked us to withdraw \u201cfrom the positions along the blue line \u2026 or up to five kilometers (three miles) from the blue line,\u201d UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) spokesperson Andrea Tenenti told Agence France-Presse (AFP), using the term for the demarcation line between both countries. \u201cBut there was a unanimous decision to stay,\u201d he said. The Israeli military on Saturday warned residents of south Lebanon \u201cnot to return\u201d to their homes as troops continued fighting Hezbollah militants in the area. In a statement, 22 southern Lebanese villages were ordered to evacuate to areas north of the Awali River. Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee reiterated an earlier call for health workers and medical teams in southern Lebanon to avoid using ambulances, claiming they are being used by Hezbollah fighters. \u201cWe call on medical teams to avoid contact with Hezbollah members and not to cooperate with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe IDF (Israeli military) affirms that the necessary actions will be taken against any vehicle transporting armed individuals, regardless of its type.\u201d Hezbollah said on Saturday it had launched a drone attack on a military base in north Israel\u2019s Haifa a day earlier. Hezbollah fighters at 8pm local time (5pmGMT/6pm BST) on Friday launched \u201can air attack with a swarm of explosives-laden drones on an air defence base\u201d in Haifa, a statement from the group said. The United Nations food agency said on Saturday that no food aid had entered northern Gaza since 1 October. The World Food Programme (WFP) said that the primary border crossing into the war-ravaged area had been closed for about two weeks, warning that Israel\u2019s ongoing ground operation has a disastrous impact on food security for thousands of Palestinian families there. US forces have conducted airstrikes against multiple Islamic State (IS) group sites in Syria, the military said on Saturday. US forces \u201cconducted a series of airstrikes against multiple known ISIS camps in Syria in the early morning of Oct. 11,\u201d the US Central Command (Centcom) said in a statement on X, using an acronym for the Islamist militant group. The Israeli military on Saturday renewed its orders for Palestinian in the northern Gaza Strip to leave their homes and shelters as troops press on a weeklong offensive against militants. Military spokesperson Avichay Adraee told people to leave parts of Gaza City\u2019s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood and other areas in and around Jabaliya. Israeli strikes on Gaza overnight killed at least 19 Palestinians, while forces continued to push deeper into the Jabalia area, where international relief agencies say thousands of people are trapped. The EU said on Saturday that it was deeply concerned about draft Israeli legislation that would ban the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) from operating in Israel and probably scale back aid distribution across war-ravaged Gaza. \u201cIf adopted, (the bill) would have disastrous consequences, preventing the UN agency from continuing to provide its services and protection to Palestinian refugees in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza,\u201d the EU said in an online statement Iran\u2019s parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf on Saturday visited the site of the deadliest Israeli strike on central Beirut in recent weeks, accompanied by two Hezbollah lawmakers. In northern Gaza, residents told the Associated Press (AP) many were trapped in their homes and shelters with dwindling supplies while seeing bodies uncollected in the streets as the bombing hampered emergency responders. Those who rushed to the scene of the latest deadly airstrikes in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya found a hole 20 meters (65 feet) deep where a home once stood, reports the AP. At least 20 bodies were recovered as of Saturday morning, while others likely were trapped under the rubble, emergency service officials said. Elsewhere in Jabaliya, a strike on a home killed two brothers and injured a woman and newborn baby, the officials said. Israel\u2019s military did not immediately respond to request for comment on the strikes, reports the AP. Military spokesperson Avichay Adraee told people in parts of Jabaliya and Gaza City to evacuate south to an Israeli-designated humanitarian zone as Israel plans to use great force \u201cand will continue to do so for a long time\u201d. Israel has repeatedly returned to parts of Gaza as Hamas and other militants regroup. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. \u201cIt\u2019s like the first days of the war,\u201d a Jabaliya resident, Ahmed Abu Goneim, told the AP. \u201cThe occupation is doing everything to uproot us. But we will not leave.\u201d The 24-year-old told the AP that Israeli warplanes and drones struck many neighboring houses in the past week, He counted 15 relatives and neighbors, including four women and five children as young as 3, killed in neighboring homes. He said there were dead in the streets and \u201cno one is able to recover them because of the bombing.\u201d Hamza Sharif, who stays with his family in a school-turned shelter in Jabaliya, described \u201cconstant bombings day and night\u201d. He told the AP that the shelter has not received aid since the beginning of the month. \u201cFamilies depend on what they have stored, but they will run out of supplies very soon,\u201d he said. The World Food Programme (WFP) said it was unclear how long the limited food supplies it distributed in northern Gaza earlier will last. A spokesperson for UN peacekeepers in Lebanon on Saturday said he feared an Israeli escalation against Lebanese militants Hezbollah in the country\u2019s south could soon spiral out of control. This risks \u201cturning very soon into a regional conflict with catastrophic impact for everyone,\u201d Unifil spokesperson Andrea Tenenti told Agence France-Presse (AFP), calling for a diplomatic solution. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) said on Saturday that unknown gunfire a day earlier hit a peacekeeper, the fifth wounded in south Lebanon near the Israeli border in just two days, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cLast night, a peacekeeper at Unifil\u2019s headquarters\u201d in Naqura \u201cwas hit by gunfire due to ongoing military activity nearby \u2026 We do not yet know the origin of the fire,\u201d a statement said, adding that the peacekeeper was \u201cstable\u201d. A spokesperson for UN peacekeepers in Lebanon on Saturday said that Israel had requested it leave its positions in south Lebanon where Israel is clashing with Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, but they had refused. They asked us to withdraw \u201cfrom the positions along the blue line \u2026 or up to five kilometers (three miles) from the blue line,\u201d UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) spokesperson Andrea Tenenti told Agence France-Presse (AFP), using the term for the demarcation line between both countries. \u201cBut there was a unanimous decision to stay,\u201d he said. It comes after two Sri Lankan members of the Unifil were injured when the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) opened fire on Friday near the peacekeeper\u2019s base in Naqoura. The Israeli army said that its soldiers had targeted what they believed to be a threat 50 metres from the base, adding that it would continue to \u201cexamine the circumstances of the incident\u201d. US forces have conducted airstrikes against multiple Islamic State (IS) group sites in Syria, the military said on Saturday, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). US forces \u201cconducted a series of airstrikes against multiple known ISIS camps in Syria in the early morning of Oct. 11,\u201d the US Central Command (Centcom) said in a statement on X, using an acronym for the Islamist militant group. \u201cThe strikes will disrupt the ability of ISIS to plan, organise, and conduct attacks against the United States, its allies and partners, and civilians throughout the region and beyond.\u201d The US military has about 900 troops in Syria as part of the international coalition against the IS group. The coalition was established in 2014 to help combat the armed group, which had taken over vast swaths of Iraq and Syria. US forces have carried out multiple retaliatory strikes against militant factions in both Iraq and Syria. In September, US forces conducted two separate strikes in Syria, killing 37 \u201cterrorist operatives\u201d including members of IS and al-Qaida affiliate Hurras al-Din. US Central Command said Saturday that its damage assessments were under way and \u201cdo not indicate civilian casualties\u201d. Iran\u2019s highest court has overturned the death sentence of a woman labour rights activist who was accused of links to an outlawed Kurdish group, local media reported on Saturday, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cThe supreme court \u2026 has overturned the verdict against my client, Ms Sharifeh Mohammadi,\u201d her lawyer Amir Raisian was quoted as saying by the reformist Shargh daily. He added that the case was referred for a re-trial. Iran carries out the highest number of executions annually after China, according to rights groups including Amnesty International. Mohammadi, 45, was sentenced to death in early July after her arrest in the northern city of Rasht, according to rights groups. She has since been accused of being a member of the Komala party, an exiled Iraq-based Kurdish separatist group that Tehran considers to be a terrorist organisation. The US has launched airstrikes targeting several camps run by the Islamic State group in Syria in an operation the US military said will disrupt the extremists from conducting attacks in the region and beyond, AP reports. The US Central Command said the airstrikes were conducted yesterday, without specifying in which parts of Syria. About 900 US troops have been deployed in eastern Syria alongside the US-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces that were instrumental in the fight against IS militants. The US military said the strikes will disrupt the ability of the Islamic State group to plan, organise and conduct attacks against the United States, its allies and partners, and civilians throughout the region and beyond. Syria borders Israel via the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, as well as Lebanon. The US said battle damage assessments were underway and there were no civilian casualties. Iran has banned pagers and walkie-talkies on all flights, AFP reports, citing local media, weeks after deadly sabotage attacks in Lebanon which were blamed on Israel. \u201cThe entry of any electronic communication device, except mobile phones, in flight cabins or ... in non-accompanied cargo, has been banned,\u201d ISNA news agency reported, quoting the spokesperson for Iran\u2019s Civil Aviation Organisation, Jafar Yazerlo. The decision came over three weeks since sabotage attacks targeting members of the Iran-allied Hezbollah group in Lebanon that saw pagers and walkie-talkies explode, killing at least 39 people. Nearly 3,000 others were wounded in the attack, which Iran and Hezbollah blamed on Israel. Earlier this month, Dubai-based airline Emirates banned pagers and walkie-talkies onboard its planes. Hezbollah said on Saturday it had launched a drone attack on a military base in north Israel\u2019s Haifa a day earlier, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. Hezbollah fighters at 8pm local time (5pmGMT/6pm BST) on Friday launched \u201can air attack with a swarm of explosives-laden drones on an air defence base\u201d in Haifa, a statement from the Iran-backed group said. The IDF reported sirens sounding in the northern city of Haifa. The military also said it identified about 30 projectiles crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory following sirens that sounded in the Upper Galilee area, which is north of Haifa, close to the border with Lebanon. Reuters reports that Israeli strikes on Gaza overnight killed at least 19 Palestinians, while forces continued to push deeper into the Jabalia area, where international relief agencies say thousands of people are trapped. Residents said Israeli forces continued to pound Jabalia, home to the largest of the enclave\u2019s historic refugee camps. There has been no fresh Israeli comment but the military said in past days that forces operating in Jabalia and nearby areas killed dozens of militants, located weapons and dismantled military infrastructure. Palestinian health officials put the number of people killed in Jabalia over the past week at around 150. \u201cThe bombardment has not stopped. Every minute there are shells, rockets and fire on the buildings and everything that moves\u201d, Areej Nasr, 35, told Agence France-Presse (AFP) after fleeing from Jabalia to Gaza City on Thursday. On Friday, Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency reported 30 people killed in Israeli strikes in the area, including on schools being used as shelter by displaced people. An AFP journalist in Gaza reported heavy artillery shelling, explosions and gunfire Saturday farther south in Gaza City\u2019s Zeitoun neighbourhood. The EU said on Saturday that it was deeply concerned about draft Israeli legislation that would ban the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) from operating in Israel and likely scale back aid distribution across war-ravaged Gaza, reports the Associated Press (AP). According to the AP, earlier this week an Israeli parliamentary committee approved a pair of bills that would ban Unrwa from operating in Israeli territory and end all contact between the government and the UN agency. The bill needs final approval from the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament. \u201cIf adopted, (the bill) would have disastrous consequences, preventing the UN agency from continuing to provide its services and protection to Palestinian refugees in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza,\u201d the EU said in an online statement, reports the AP. Israel has alleged that some of Unrwa\u2019s thousands of staff members participated in the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack. The UN has since fired more than a dozen staffers after internal investigations found they may have taken part in the attack that killed 1,200 people in southern Israel. The UN agency has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to Palestinian civilians during the 12 month conflict in Gaza. Concern about the Israeli bill was echoed by Unrwa\u2019s commissioner general, Philippe Lazzarini, on Wednesday, who said all humanitarian operations in Gaza and the West Bank could \u201cdisintegrate\u201d if the bill was implemented. Lazzarini has previously accused Israel of seeking to close down Unrwa. The United Nations food agency said on Saturday that no food aid had entered northern Gaza since 1 October, reports the Associated Press (AP). The World Food Programme (WFP) said that the primary border crossing into the war-ravaged area had been closed for about two weeks, warning that Israel\u2019s ongoing ground operation has a disastrous impact on food security for thousands of Palestinian families there. \u201cThe north is basically cut off and we\u2019re not able to operate there,\u201d said Antoine Renard, the WFP country director of Palestinian territories, according to the AP. The UN Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, has said that as many as 400,000 people are believed to be trapped by Israel\u2019s latest Gaza offensive. Concerns of a hunger crisis have risen in Gaza roughly a month after the UN\u2019s independent investigator on the right to food accused Israel of carrying out a \u201cstarvation campaign\u201d against Palestinians. Israel has denied such allegations and insisted that it has allowed food and other aid into Gaza in significant quantities. \u201cIsrael has not halted the entry or coordination of humanitarian aid entering from its territory into the northern Gaza Strip. As evidence, humanitarian aid coordinated by Cogat and international organisations will continue to enter the northern Gaza Strip in the coming day as well,\u201d Cogat, the Israeli military body overseeing aid distribution, said in a statement on Wednesday. The WFP said its food distribution points, as well as kitchens and bakeries in northern Gaza, have been forced to shut down due to airstrikes, military ground operations and evacuation orders, reports the AP. It said that the only functioning bakery in north Gaza, supported by WFP, caught fire after being hit by an explosive munition. The WFP said its last remaining food supplies in the north \u2013 including canned food, wheat flour, high-energy biscuits, and nutrition supplements \u2013 have been distributed to shelters, health facilities and kitchens in Gaza City and three shelters in the northern areas. It is unclear how long these limited food supplies will last, said the WFP, warning that the consequences for fleeing families will be dire if the escalation continues. The Israeli military on Saturday renewed its orders for Palestinian in the northern Gaza Strip to leave their homes and shelters as troops press on a weeklong offensive against militants, reports the Associated Press (AP). Military spokesperson Avichay Adraee told people to leave parts of Gaza City\u2019s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood and other areas in and around Jabaliya, the urban refugee camp where Israeli forces carried out several major operations over the course of the war and then returned as militants regroup. In a post on X, Adraee asked people to head south to Muwasi, a packed area in southern Gaza designed by the military as a humanitarian zone, reports the AP. Most of the fighting in the past week was centered in and around Jabaliya that was pounded by Israeli war jets and artillery. The AP reports that residents said they have been trapped inside their homes and shelters. The military also ordered the three main hospitals in northern Gaza to evacuate patients and medical staff. Iran\u2019s parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf on Saturday visited the site of the deadliest Israeli strike on central Beirut in recent weeks, accompanied by two Hezbollah lawmakers, an Agence France-Presse (AFP) photographer said. According to AFP, a source close to Hezbollah has said that the air raid on Thursday night in the densely populated Basta area, which killed at least 22 people, had targeted the Iran-backed group\u2019s security chief Wafiq Safa, but his fate remains unknown. Further to the news that the Israeli military on Saturday warned residents of south Lebanon \u201cnot to return\u201d to their homes as troops continued fighting Hezbollah militants in the area (see 9.38am BST), Reuters has some more detail on the specific area mentioned. According to the news agency, the statement refers to 22 southern Lebanese villages whose residents have been ordered to evacuate to areas north of the Awali River. Images on the newswires show Palestinians fleeing areas in the northern Gaza Strip after a fresh Israeli evacuation order: In a separate post on X to the one we reported on earlier (see 9.38am BST), Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee reiterated an earlier call for health workers and medical teams in southern Lebanon to avoid using ambulances, claiming they are being used by Hezbollah fighters. \u201cWe call on medical teams to avoid contact with Hezbollah members and not to cooperate with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe IDF (Israeli military) affirms that the necessary actions will be taken against any vehicle transporting armed individuals, regardless of its type.\u201d On Saturday, Adraee called on residents of the area around Sheikh Radwan, south of Jabalia refugee camp, to evacuate. \u201cThe specified area, including the shelters within it, is considered a dangerous combat zone,\u201d Adraee said on X, ordering residents to move to the humanitarian zone in the southern part of the strip. In a social media post on X, Unicef has said that children in Lebanon are \u201cliving in fear\u201d. The UN agency says it has been providing displaced children in Lebanon with \u201cessential needs, including mental health support\u201d but that what they \u201creally need is a ceasefire\u201d. The Israeli military on Saturday warned residents of south Lebanon \u201cnot to return\u201d to their homes as troops continued fighting Hezbollah militants in the area, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Israeli forces continue to \u201ctarget Hezbollah posts in or near your villages\u201d, military spokesperson Avichay Adraee said on X. He wrote: For your own protection, do not return to your homes until further notice. Do not go south; anyone who goes south may put his life at risk.\u201d At least 30 people have been killed by Israeli strikes throughout the day in northern Gaza\u2019s Jabalia town and refugee camp, Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency has said, a week after Israel launched an offensive there which it claims is aimed at stopping Hamas regrouping. The agency\u2019s spokesperson, Mahmud Bassal, said a strike that occurred before 9.40pm local time killed 12 people including women and children, while 14 were missing and likely trapped under the rubble. Before that incident, Ahmad al-Kahlut \u2013 director of the agency in northern Gaza \u2013 said 18 people had been killed by several strikes, including hits on eight schools in the camp that were serving as shelters for displaced people. In total, the day\u2019s strikes left at least 110 injured, according to figures provided by Bassal and Kahlut. The Israeli military did not respond to questions posed by the news agency AFP about the strikes on schools in Jabalia, the largest of Gaza\u2019s historic refugee camps. Medics told Reuters that at least 61 Palestinians were killed across the Gaza Strip on Friday. The Israeli military claims it has killed dozens of militants in Jabalia, without providing any evidence. Photos published from the area by news wires have shown many children among the dead. It is not possible to independently verify death tolls from the camp as Israel does not allow foreign journalists in. The charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), meanwhile, said thousands of people remained trapped in the camp while one staff member said people trying to leave \u2013 Israel has issued widespread evacuation orders for northern Gaza \u2013 are being shot. At least 42,175 Palestinians have been killed and 98,336 others injured in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October 2023, Gaza\u2019s health ministry said on Saturday. The ministry does not distinguished not distinguish between militant and civilian deaths. The Unifil peacekeepers have found themselves on the frontline of the Israel-Hezbollah war, which has killed more than 1,200 people in Lebanon, according to an Agence France-Presse (AFP) tally of Lebanese health ministry figures. The latest incident came a day after two Indonesian soldiers were hurt when, according to Unifil, tank fire hit a watchtower. Sean Clancy, the Irish military\u2019s chief of staff, said he did not believe Israel\u2019s explanation of Friday\u2019s incident, reports AFP. \u201cSo from a military perspective, this is not an accidental act,\u201d said Clancy, whose country has troops in Unifil. UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres condemned the firing as \u201cintolerable\u201d and \u201ca violation of international humanitarian law,\u201d while the UK government said it was \u201cappalled\u201d by reports of the wounded. US president Joe Biden said on Friday he was \u201cabsolutely\u201d asking Israel to stop firing at UN peacekeepers, while the French, Spanish and Italian leaders issued a joint statement expressing \u201coutrage.\u201d AFP reports that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, renewed his call for an end to exports of weapons used by Israel in Gaza and Lebanon, while saying the UN peacekeepers had been \u201cdeliberately targeted\u201d. The incidents came more than two weeks into Israel\u2019s war with Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon, which has seen Israeli warplanes conduct extensive strikes since 23 September on the militants\u2019 strongholds, with multiple civilian areas hit, and ground troops deployed across the border. Lebanese militant group Hezbollah on Saturday said it launched a salvo of missiles at an Israeli military base south of the coastal city of Haifa, as Israelis marked the Yom Kippur holiday. Hezbollah fighters struck a base \u201csouth of the city of Haifa, targeting the explosives factory there with a salvo of \u2026 missiles\u201d, the group said in a statement, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The health of Al Jazeera cameraman, Fadi Al-Wahidi, who was shot by Israeli forces in northern Gaza on Wednesday, has deteriorated \u201csignificantly\u201d, his colleague has said, appealing for help in evacuating him from the area. Anas Al-Sharif wrote on X: Fadi was shot by an Israeli sniper while professionally covering events, and he was wearing a press vest clearly marking him as a journalist. We are currently in northern Gaza, under siege by Israeli forces. If he does not receive urgent medical treatment abroad, his life is at serious risk.\u201d In an earlier post Sharif said that Al-Wahidi had been permanently paralysed in the attack. Foreign doctors who have deployed in Gaza have said that many patients who could be saved given the right medical treatment have died in Gaza due to grossly inadequate treatments available in the territory as Israel targets hospitals and limits humanitarian aid. Ireland\u2019s prime minister urged Israel on Saturday to heed \u201cthe concerns of the international community\u201d and not repeat recent firing on UN peacekeepers in southern Lebanon. \u201cIsrael must stop firing on UN peacekeepers serving with Unifil in Lebanon,\u201d Simon Harris said in a statement, his latest comments on the recent incidents that have sparked a fierce diplomatic backlash. He added: Israel must listen to the voice and the concerns of the international community.\u201d Ireland accounts for 347 of the 10,000 soldiers serving in Unifil, the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, which is charged with maintaining peace in the country\u2019s south. Israel said its forces fired at a threat near a Unifil position in Lebanon on Friday, acknowledging that a \u201chit\u201d was responsible for wounding two blue helmets. The two Sri Lankan peacekeepers were hurt at Unifil\u2019s main base in Naqura, southern Lebanon, according to the mission. It follows two Indonesian soldiers suffering injuries when tank fire hit a watchtower the previous day, the mission said. The Irish military has said none of its staff were hurt in Thursday\u2019s incident. Harris, who visited Joe Biden earlier in the week, said he and the US president \u201cagreed that those who serve in blue helmets on behalf of the UN must always be afforded full protection\u201d. Meanwhile in Gaza, at least 61 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes on Friday, nearly half of the them killed in Jabalia, the northern district which is the largest of Gaza\u2019s refugee camps. Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency said at least 30 people were killed by Israeli strikes throughout the day in northern Gaza\u2019s Jabalia town and refugee camp. At least 12 people were killed, including women and children, in an evening strike, it said. Dozens of Palestinians were reported to have been injured when an Israeli military quadcopter drone opened fire on a school sheltering displaced people in the Jabalia camp. In other developments: Hezbollah said on Saturday it launched a salvo of missiles at an Israeli military base south of the coastal city of Haifa, as Israelis marked the Yom Kippur holiday. Hezbollah fighters struck a base \u201ctargeting the explosives factory there with a salvo of \u2026 missiles\u201d, the Lebanese militant group said in a statement. Joe Biden, the US president, said he was asking Israel not to hit UN peacekeepers, and the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, told Israel that attacks on the peacekeeping force were intolerable. Downing Street said Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, was \u201cappalled\u201d at reports Israel deliberately fired on the peacekeepers. The leaders of France, Italy and Spain said in a joint statement the attacks were \u201cunjustifiable\u201d and a \u201cserious violation of the obligations of Israel\u201d under humanitarian international law. Thousands of Palestinians are trapped in Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, the charity Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said, including five of its staff, who were \u201cfearing for their lives\u201d. \u201cNobody is allowed to get in or out \u2013 anyone who tries is getting shot,\u201d MSF project coordinator Sarah Vuylsteke said. It called on Israeli forces to stop forced displacements and stop the \u201call-out war on the people of Gaza\u201d. At least 42,126 Palestinians had been killed by the Israeli military in Gaza since the war started a year ago, according to the latest figures from the Hamas-run health ministry on Friday. The figures were released prior to the latest deadly Israeli strikes on Friday, including in Jabalia in northern Gaza. At least eight people were killed in Israeli airstrikes across villages in southern and eastern Lebanon on Friday evening, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. Three people were killed, including a two-year-old and a 16-year-old, when an Israeli airstrike hit Baysarieh, a village in Sidon province. Three others were injured, the Lebanese ministry said. Five people were killed and five others injured in additional airstrikes in Baalbeck-Hermel province, located in the Bekaa valley, it said. An Israeli airstrike killed two Lebanese soldiers and wounded three others in the southern Bint Jbeil province on Friday, prompting futher concern over Israel\u2019s escalating campaign. Lebanon\u2019s army has not been involved in the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, and it withdrew its forces from the border between the two countries when Israel launched its invasion last month. At least 60 people were killed and 168 injured in the past 24 hours in Lebanon, the country\u2019s crisis response unit said on Friday. The latest figure takes the total number of people killed in Lebanon over the past year to 2,229 killed and 10,380 injured, according to Lebanon\u2019s health ministry. The crisis response unit also reported 57 airstrikes and incidents of shelling in the past day, mostly concentrated in southern Lebanon, the southern suburbs of Beirut and the Bekaa valley. The UN human rights office said more than 100 medics and emergency workers had been killed in Lebanon since a conflict between Israel and Hezbollah began a year ago. Israel\u2019s military said air raid sirens sounded in several areas in central Israel on Friday due to a \u201chostile aircraft infiltration\u201d. Israel\u2019s military said two drones were detected \u201cfrom the moment when they crossed the Lebanese border\u201d late on Friday, and that it had successfully intercepted one of them. However, one building in Herzliya sustained some damage, the IDF and Israeli police said. UN officials voiced concerns that an Israeli offensive and evacuation orders in northern Gaza could affect the second phase of its polio vaccination campaign, scheduled to start next week. Abbas Araqchi, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, said Tehran would not hesitate to take \u201cstronger defensive actions\u201d if Israel retaliated for last week\u2019s missile attack. Araqchi said Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel had been in accordance with its right to self-defence under international law and followed much restraint as it sought a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN relief organisation for Palestinian refugees across the region (Unrwa), said people in Gaza had become accustomed to being moved about \u201clike pinballs\u201d by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) operations. He feared that the people of southern Lebanon were facing a similar plight, he said.",

We call for these attacks to stop and recognise Israel\u2019s right to defend itself. Australia urges the exercise of restraint and protection of civilian lives.\u201d</p> \n<p>7 October 2023</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Peter Dutton, opposition leader</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen people talk about Israel having to show restraint, it\u2019s completely and utterly the wrong time for that sort of language \u2026 I think it\u2019s important for us to speak in a bipartisan way, but the Coalition won\u2019t be using any language about restraint from the Israeli people at the moment. Their focus is on defeating this scourge and making sure that they can recover their citizens.\u201d</p> \n<p>11 October 2023</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Adam Bandt, leader of the Greens</p> \n<p>\u201cThe premeditated targeting of civilians by Hamas is a war crime, as is the bombing of Palestinian civilians by the state of Israel. All perpetrators of war crimes in this conflict must be held to account for their actions in accordance with international law. The Greens condemn the attacks and we condemn the occupation.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Labor and Coalition back a parliamentary motion, Greens dissent</h2> \n<p>16 October 2023</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Anthony Albanese, prime minister</p> \n<p>\u201cThis was not just an attack on Israel. This was an attack on Jewish people. Let us be clear: Hamas is an enemy, but not just of Israel. Hamas is an enemy of all peace-loving Palestinian people who are left to pay a devastating price for this terrorism. Hamas honours no faith. It serves no cause but terror. It is no better than any other group in history that has clung to the twisted belief that victory can be built on the blood of the innocent \u2026 There is no question that Israel has the right to defend itself against a terrorist organisation and to take strong action against it, but we join the calls of President Biden and other partners for Israel to operate by the rules of war.\u201d</p> \n<p>16 October 2023</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Peter Dutton, opposition leader</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Coalition joins with every other person of decent humanity in condemning this attack by Hamas militants on Israel. Israel has every right to exist. Israel has every right to defend itself and its people. Israel has every right to deter future attacks and other acts of aggression, of coercion and of interference. The Coalition supports, and proudly supports, Israel\u2019s right to do what is necessary and needed in the circumstances, with every asset available to safeguard its sovereignty, to bolster its borders, to protect its people and to thwart the threats it now faces \u2013 the existential threats. There must be no restraint shown to those who have shown no restraint themselves in committing these vicious and vile acts of terrorism.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/08/albanese-government-israel-gaza-war-response-guardian-essential-poll\">Guardian Essential poll: more than half of Australians approve of Albanese government\u2019s response to Israel-Gaza war</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>16 October 2023</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Adam Bandt, leader of the Greens</p> \n<p>\u201cThis looming humanitarian catastrophe is something that Australia should be joining other countries in trying everything we can to stop. We join with everyone in this parliament in mourning the 1,300 Israelis* who have lost their lives, but on today\u2019s count there are also between 2,300 and 2,600 Palestinians who have lost their lives, many of who are children. And we mourn them as well. This is now moving beyond self-defence into an invasion, and it is up to Australia as a peace-loving country to join the push to stop it. No to antisemitism, no to Islamophobia and no to the war on Gaza.\u201d * The Israeli death toll was later updated to be about 1,200 killed</p> \n<h2>Australia votes at the UN for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and release of hostages.</h2> \n<p>13 December 2023</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Penny Wong, foreign minister</p> \n<p>\u201cAustralia shares the grave concerns that I have articulated previously about the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. Human suffering is widespread, and it is unacceptable \u2026 This is a collective statement about the need for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire that the world is supporting. So, this is not a unilateral decision by Australia.&nbsp;We made a decision on the basis of the merits of this resolution to join along with many other countries to support the resolution at the General Assembly.\u201d</p> \n<p>13 December 2023</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Simon Birmingham, Coalition foreign affairs spokesperson</p> \n<p>&nbsp;\u201cWar is terrible, and I grieve for absolutely every single life that is lost that is an innocent civilian, particularly those of children. But the reality is, if Israel just adopts the ceasefire that Anthony Albanese has now voted for, it will just give Hamas opportunity to re-arm, regroup and repeat. The terrorist atrocities all over again.\u201d</p> \n<p>13 December 2023</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Adam Bandt, leader of the Greens</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a ceasefire until the bombs stop dropping. The PM must fight like hell to make this ceasefire call a permanent reality. Not a pause before the slaughter starts again. A genuine, permanent ceasefire.\u201d</p> \n<h2>South Africa initiates genocide proceedings against Israel at the international court of justice</h2> \n<p>16 January 2024</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Penny Wong, foreign affairs minister</p> \n<p>\u201cOur support for the ICJ and respect for its independence does not mean we accept the premise of South Africa\u2019s case. We will continue to work for a just and enduring peace between Israelis and Palestinians. I would note Australia is not currently a party to the case and that at this stage the ICJ has not invited interventions from other parties.\u201d</p> \n<p>5 January 2024</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Simon Birmingham, Coalition foreign affairs spokesperson</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Albanese government should rule out supporting South Africa\u2019s unbalanced application against Israel to the ICJ. Mr Albanese has been wildly inconsistent in the positions his government has taken, with Labor deeply divided.

      "bodyText": "The past year in Australian politics has been marked by division over how to respond to the 7 October Hamas attacks and Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza \u2013 with no shortage of accusations about who is politicising the conflict. Those divisions came to a head this week when Peter Dutton\u2019s Coalition refused to support a parliamentary motion marking the first anniversary of 7 October because it also included calls for regional de-escalation and a ceasefire. Explore this timeline to find out how the Labor government, Coalition opposition and Greens have responded to key events over the past 12 months. Hamas attacks Israel; Israel launches airstrikes on Gaza 7 October 2023 Penny Wong, foreign affairs minister \u201cAustralia unequivocally condemns the attacks on Israel by Hamas including indiscriminate rocket fire on cities and civilians. We call for these attacks to stop and recognise Israel\u2019s right to defend itself. Australia urges the exercise of restraint and protection of civilian lives.\u201d 7 October 2023 Peter Dutton, opposition leader \u201cWhen people talk about Israel having to show restraint, it\u2019s completely and utterly the wrong time for that sort of language \u2026 I think it\u2019s important for us to speak in a bipartisan way, but the Coalition won\u2019t be using any language about restraint from the Israeli people at the moment. Their focus is on defeating this scourge and making sure that they can recover their citizens.\u201d 11 October 2023 Adam Bandt, leader of the Greens \u201cThe premeditated targeting of civilians by Hamas is a war crime, as is the bombing of Palestinian civilians by the state of Israel. All perpetrators of war crimes in this conflict must be held to account for their actions in accordance with international law. The Greens condemn the attacks and we condemn the occupation.\u201d Labor and Coalition back a parliamentary motion, Greens dissent 16 October 2023 Anthony Albanese, prime minister \u201cThis was not just an attack on Israel. This was an attack on Jewish people. Let us be clear: Hamas is an enemy, but not just of Israel. Hamas is an enemy of all peace-loving Palestinian people who are left to pay a devastating price for this terrorism. Hamas honours no faith. It serves no cause but terror. It is no better than any other group in history that has clung to the twisted belief that victory can be built on the blood of the innocent \u2026 There is no question that Israel has the right to defend itself against a terrorist organisation and to take strong action against it, but we join the calls of President Biden and other partners for Israel to operate by the rules of war.\u201d 16 October 2023 Peter Dutton, opposition leader \u201cThe Coalition joins with every other person of decent humanity in condemning this attack by Hamas militants on Israel. Israel has every right to exist. Israel has every right to defend itself and its people. Israel has every right to deter future attacks and other acts of aggression, of coercion and of interference. The Coalition supports, and proudly supports, Israel\u2019s right to do what is necessary and needed in the circumstances, with every asset available to safeguard its sovereignty, to bolster its borders, to protect its people and to thwart the threats it now faces \u2013 the existential threats. There must be no restraint shown to those who have shown no restraint themselves in committing these vicious and vile acts of terrorism.\u201d 16 October 2023 Adam Bandt, leader of the Greens \u201cThis looming humanitarian catastrophe is something that Australia should be joining other countries in trying everything we can to stop. We join with everyone in this parliament in mourning the 1,300 Israelis* who have lost their lives, but on today\u2019s count there are also between 2,300 and 2,600 Palestinians who have lost their lives, many of who are children. And we mourn them as well. This is now moving beyond self-defence into an invasion, and it is up to Australia as a peace-loving country to join the push to stop it. No to antisemitism, no to Islamophobia and no to the war on Gaza.\u201d * The Israeli death toll was later updated to be about 1,200 killed Australia votes at the UN for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and release of hostages. 13 December 2023 Penny Wong, foreign minister \u201cAustralia shares the grave concerns that I have articulated previously about the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. Human suffering is widespread, and it is unacceptable \u2026 This is a collective statement about the need for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire that the world is supporting. So, this is not a unilateral decision by Australia. We made a decision on the basis of the merits of this resolution to join along with many other countries to support the resolution at the General Assembly.\u201d 13 December 2023 Simon Birmingham, Coalition foreign affairs spokesperson \u201cWar is terrible, and I grieve for absolutely every single life that is lost that is an innocent civilian, particularly those of children. But the reality is, if Israel just adopts the ceasefire that Anthony Albanese has now voted for, it will just give Hamas opportunity to re-arm, regroup and repeat. The terrorist atrocities all over again.\u201d 13 December 2023 Adam Bandt, leader of the Greens \u201cIt\u2019s not a ceasefire until the bombs stop dropping. The PM must fight like hell to make this ceasefire call a permanent reality. Not a pause before the slaughter starts again. A genuine, permanent ceasefire.\u201d South Africa initiates genocide proceedings against Israel at the international court of justice 16 January 2024 Penny Wong, foreign affairs minister \u201cOur support for the ICJ and respect for its independence does not mean we accept the premise of South Africa\u2019s case. We will continue to work for a just and enduring peace between Israelis and Palestinians. I would note Australia is not currently a party to the case and that at this stage the ICJ has not invited interventions from other parties.\u201d 5 January 2024 Simon Birmingham, Coalition foreign affairs spokesperson \u201cThe Albanese government should rule out supporting South Africa\u2019s unbalanced application against Israel to the ICJ. Mr Albanese has been wildly inconsistent in the positions his government has taken, with Labor deeply divided. Australia should maintain a strong commitment in support of Israel\u2019s inherent right to self-defence after Hamas\u2019s horrific targeting of civilians, while continuing to expect Israel to act with regard to international law.\u201d 18 January 2024 Mehreen Faruqi, deputy leader of the Greens \u201cAustralia must publicly support South Africa\u2019s genocide case against Israel in the international court of justice. The world is watching and Australians are demanding that Anthony Albanese put politics aside, show some guts and be remembered on the right side of history.\u201d Australia pauses funding to Unrwa after Israel accuses 12 staff of involvement in 7 October attacks 27 January 2024 Penny Wong, foreign affairs minister \u201cAustralia is deeply concerned by allegations Unrwa staff may have been involved in the abhorrent October 7 terror attacks. We welcome Unrwa\u2019s immediate response, including terminating contracts and launching an investigation, as well as its recent announcement of a full investigation into allegations against the organisation.\u201d 1 February 2024 Peter Dutton, opposition leader \u201cIf she\u2019s knowingly sent that money to a terrorist organisation, then I think that is an outrage, and I think Penny Wong and the prime minister have more questions than answers in relation to this particular issue.\u201d 29 January 2024 Mehreen Faruqi, deputy leader of the Greens \u201cThe Labor government\u2019s blatant hypocrisy is on full display \u2013 suspending funding to Unrwa while Palestinians are being killed, starved and displaced, but not so much as a slap on the wrist for Israel which is on a genocidal mission.\u201d Australian aid worker Zomi Frankcom is killed in Gaza 4 April 2024 Anthony Albanese, prime minister \u201cPeople would have seen the footage of the vehicle that was hit in this strike by an Israeli missile that clearly is identified as being from the World Central Kitchen. These vehicles were going about carrying the best of humanity, people who\u2019d come from all over the world to help Palestinians who are suffering from extraordinary deprivation in Gaza. And for them to lose their life in these circumstances is outrageous and completely unacceptable. Humanitarian workers are protected under international law. And the Netanyahu government must publish a full and transparent investigation. And they must be held accountable.\u201d 7 April 2024 Simon Birmingham, Coalition foreign affairs spokesperson \u201cThis is a tragedy. It shouldn\u2019t have happened. It is wrong that it happened. We\u2019ve been very clear about that. We have expectations in terms of the investigations that should occur. But we also cannot turn away or be so naive as to pretend that tragedies and mistakes don\u2019t occur in war. They do. They happen all the time. It\u2019s a terrible thing. We\u2019d wish it wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d 4 April 2024 Mehreen Faruqi, deputy leader of the Greens \u201cIsrael\u2019s targeting of a clearly identified convoy of aid workers is just one example of their attacks and undermining of aid agencies and workers. Just a phone call simply isn\u2019t good enough. The Australian government must respond with actions, not words.\u201d Australia among 143 countries to grant additional rights to the Palestinian delegation at the UN 11 May 2024 Penny Wong, foreign affairs minister \u201cWe all know one vote won\u2019t, on its own, end this conflict. It has spanned our entire lifetimes. But we all have to do what we can to build momentum towards peace. I want to be extremely clear again. This vote is not about whether Australia recognises Palestine. We will do that when we think the time is right.

Recognising Palestine won\u2019t by itself stop the slaughter in Rafah, the invasion, or the occupation; but it is an important step towards peace, equality and justice.\u201d International criminal court prosecutor applies for arrest warrants for leaders of Israel and Hamas 23 May 2024 Anthony Albanese, prime minister \u201cWell, I\u2019m not about to go into hypotheticals about things that have not happened \u2026 There\u2019s been an application.

No one is above the law \u2026 What we do here matters. Labor cannot follow Joe Biden\u2019s flagrant disregard for the independent court.\u201d Coalition attacks Labor over visas for Palestinians fleeing Gaza 14 August 2024 Peter Dutton, opposition leader \u201cIf people are coming in from that war zone and we\u2019re uncertain about identity or their allegiances \u2013 Hamas is a listed terrorist organisation, they\u2019ve just committed an atrocity against the Jewish people, the biggest attack on people of Jewish faith since the Holocaust \u2013 and that the government wouldn\u2019t be conducting checks?

Though they dismissed jazz as degenerate \u201cnegro music\u201d, the Nazis never sought a nationwide ban on the music by law, and for a few years the band continued to play Berlin venues under the Germanicised name \u201cDie Weintraubs\u201d.</p>    <p>But a day after watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1933/mar/28/leadersandreply.mainsection\">the burning of the Reichstag</a> on 27 February 1933, the band decided to embark on an international tour from which they would never return. \u201cWeintraubs Syncopators were never officially banned or expatriated, but since the man whose name they bore and most of their members were Jewish, their fate was clear,\u201d said D\u00fcmling.</p> <p>After successful gigs in the Soviet Union and Japan, the band moved to Australia but struggled to get a foothold on the local scene due to the musician union\u2019s opposition. In 1941, not just its German members but also Polish and Chilean nationals in its lineup were interned as enemy aliens. As D\u00fcmling discovered in the National Archives of Australia, a British officer had denounced them as Soviet spies, and for lack of proof or counter-proof for the allegations the Syncopators remained behind razor wire fencing.</p> <p>After the end of the war, most of the band\u2019s members stayed in Sydney but drifted apart, some working as mechanics, others as fridge salesmen.</p> <p>Behind the Oppenheimer portrait of the band, however, also lie the stories of several others exiles brought about by the rise of fascism. The artist himself left Berlin in 1931, later emigrating to Switzerland and the US.</p> <p>The painting\u2019s owner, a prominent lawyer and amateur psychoanalyst called Hugo Staub, also left the city in a haste in mid-March 1933, the artwork staying behind at his apartment off the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm. According to an affidavit signed by Staub\u2019s son in the 1960s, none other than Hitler\u2019s confidant Ernst \u201cPutzi\u201d Hanfstaengl had informed Staub that he was imminently due to be arrested as a prominent member of the League for Human Rights.</p> <p>What happened to the painting over the course of the war and first postwar years is unclear, but in 1962 the artwork was auctioned off to a former Berlin property developer living in exile in Canada. For half a century, it adorned family living rooms in Montreal and Ottawa, before being loaned to the National Gallery of Canada and finally sold to the Jewish Museum in Berlin.</p> <p>\u201cThere came a point where I thought it would be good for these musicians to be celebrated again where they came from,\u201d said Ruth Freiman, whose uncle purchased the painting in 1962.</p> <p>The exchange took place with the permission of the descendants of the painting\u2019s first owner Hugo Staub, who received an ex gratia payment as part of the sale. The various families and individuals tied together by Oppenheimer\u2019s painting are set to attend its unveiling in Berlin on 21 October.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s an enormous sense of completion\u201d, said Michael Fisher, a Zurich-based Australian whose father Emanuel and uncle Addy were part of the Syncopators\u2019 final lineup before their dissolution. \u201cTo see the band return to the city they left behind the day after the Reichstag fire means the world to me.\u201d</p>",

In 1941, not just its German members but also Polish and Chilean nationals in its lineup were interned as enemy aliens. As D\u00fcmling discovered in the National Archives of Australia, a British officer had denounced them as Soviet spies, and for lack of proof or counter-proof for the allegations the Syncopators remained behind razor wire fencing. After the end of the war, most of the band\u2019s members stayed in Sydney but drifted apart, some working as mechanics, others as fridge salesmen. Behind the Oppenheimer portrait of the band, however, also lie the stories of several others exiles brought about by the rise of fascism. The artist himself left Berlin in 1931, later emigrating to Switzerland and the US. The painting\u2019s owner, a prominent lawyer and amateur psychoanalyst called Hugo Staub, also left the city in a haste in mid-March 1933, the artwork staying behind at his apartment off the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm. According to an affidavit signed by Staub\u2019s son in the 1960s, none other than Hitler\u2019s confidant Ernst \u201cPutzi\u201d Hanfstaengl had informed Staub that he was imminently due to be arrested as a prominent member of the League for Human Rights. What happened to the painting over the course of the war and first postwar years is unclear, but in 1962 the artwork was auctioned off to a former Berlin property developer living in exile in Canada. For half a century, it adorned family living rooms in Montreal and Ottawa, before being loaned to the National Gallery of Canada and finally sold to the Jewish Museum in Berlin. \u201cThere came a point where I thought it would be good for these musicians to be celebrated again where they came from,\u201d said Ruth Freiman, whose uncle purchased the painting in 1962. The exchange took place with the permission of the descendants of the painting\u2019s first owner Hugo Staub, who received an ex gratia payment as part of the sale. The various families and individuals tied together by Oppenheimer\u2019s painting are set to attend its unveiling in Berlin on 21 October. \u201cThere\u2019s an enormous sense of completion\u201d, said Michael Fisher, a Zurich-based Australian whose father Emanuel and uncle Addy were part of the Syncopators\u2019 final lineup before their dissolution. \u201cTo see the band return to the city they left behind the day after the Reichstag fire means the world to me.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for joining us today. This blog is closing soon. Here\u2019s where things stand: Kamala Harris released a report on her medical history today \u2013 drawing a contrast with her opponent, who has repeatedly promised and then refused to do the same. The report concludes that Harris \u201cpossesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency\u201d. Harris is campaigning in North Carolina this weekend, spending much of her time with Black faith leaders and on hurricane recovery efforts. Donald Trump attended a roundtable with Latino voters in Las Vegas this afternoon, where he focused on immigration and inflation. He\u2019s on to Coachella, California, later this evening, where he\u2019s expected to speak on immigration and try to convince voters in the reliably blue state to support his candidacy. Our latest polling shows Harris and Trump are neck-and-neck, with Trump gaining ground on Harris in crucial swing states. Currently, Harris has a slight advantage in Pennsylvania, while Trump is leading in Arizona. Ex-president Barack Obama will stump for Harris in Detroit later this month. The announcement comes just days after Trump insulted the manufacturing hub while campaigning there. The New York Times published an hourlong interview with JD Vance today, wherein the vice-presidential nominee refused five times to say that Trump lost the 2020 election. At a rally in Pennsylvania this afternoon, he refused to do so once again. Speaking at a Pennsylvania rally earlier today, JD Vance again refused to say Donald Trump lost the 2020 election. The news came the same day the New York Times released an hourlong interview with Vance, wherein Vance refused five times to say the former president had lost the election. \u201cAs I said in that interview, and I\u2019m gonna say to you right now, I think the election of 2020 had serious problems,\u201d Vance said. Trump\u2019s roundtable in Las Vegas has concluded and he\u2019s en route to a second event this evening in Coachella, California. Attendees waiting in near 100F temperatures are telling the Associated Press that they don\u2019t expect Trump to win their state but are excited to see him all the same. The AP notes that while Trump may not win California, he\u2019ll likely be able to drum up significant financial support in the state. Photos with the former president in Coachella were priced at $25,000, which comes with special seating for two. A \u201cVIP experience\u201d was priced at $5,000. Kamala Harris is en route to North Carolina, where she\u2019ll speak with Black churchgoers and aid in disaster relief efforts. Before her departure, she told reporters a bit about her decision to release her medical report this morning, saying it was in part to pressure Trump to do the same. \u201cI think that it\u2019s obvious that his team, at least, does not want the American people to see everything about who he is,\u201d Harris told reporters before boarding a plane to North Carolina, says Reuters. The Hill reports much of the same: Speaking in Las Vegas this afternoon, Trump focused his remarks on immigration and inflation, arguing that the economic policies of the Biden-Harris administration have disadvantaged Latino families. The former president attempted to strike a tone of respect with members of the Latino roundtable, emphasizing their contributions to the US economy, as compared with the non-citizens he\u2019s denounced at length in recent speeches. \u201cI\u2019ve had such great support from the Hispanic community, and from the Black community. The highest level ever. And there are those that say, we\u2019ll end up breaking the 50% mark,\u201d Trump said. According to a September Pew Research Center report, a majority of Latino-registered voters (57%) say they would vote for Kamala Harris and 39% would vote for Trump. Meanwhile, a recent New York Times/Siena Poll and an August Pew Research Center survey showed that more than three-fourths of Black voters have said they would vote for Harris. The roundtable is ongoing, with Trump about to hear from local Latino business-owners. Trump\u2019s roundtable in Las Vegas has begun, with what appears to be a fairly small crowd. His campaign is more widely touting its event in Coachella this evening with a series of music festival-inspired ads on social media. Former Texas representative Mayra Flores has begun the Las Vegas event by introducing the other guests in attendance, which include Bob Unanue, CEO of Goya Foods, and Sam Brown, a military officer currently running for one of Nevada\u2019s senate seats. Trump has yet to begin speaking. Ex-president Barack Obama will campaign in Detroit later this month for Kamala Harris. The Detroit News reports that Obama will visit the state on 22 October. The announcement of his visit comes just days after Donald Trump insulted the manufacturing hub while campaining there. Obama has begun campaigning for Harris in the final weeks before the 2024 election, hoping to drum up support in swing states. He made his first appearance on behalf of the nominee in Pittsburgh this week. Donald Trump will appear at a roundtable with Latino voters in Las Vegas shortly. We\u2019ll be following along and will share any major takeaways with you \u2013 according to his campaign, Trump is expected to focus on inflation and his \u201dno tax on tips\u201d policy. Meanwhile, JD Vance has been campaigning in Pennsylvania, where Trump\u2019s running mate answered questions from reporters in front of a crowd of supporters. The New York Times published an hour-long interview with JD Vance this morning, covering the vice-presidential nominee\u2019s stance on abortion rights, immigration, the economy and the 2020 election. Vance spoke at length about his Catholic faith and views on reproductive rights, refused to say Joe Biden won the 2020 election, and committed to a peaceful transfer of power \u2013 were Donald Trump to win the 2024 election. He also walked back his criticism of \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d before saying he thought it was \u201cbizarre\u201d and \u201csociopathic\u201d not to have children because of fears around climate change. Our latest polling shows Harris and Trump are neck-and-neck, with Trump gaining ground on Harris in crucial swing states. Robert Tait reports: \u201cthe Guardian\u2019s 10-day polling average tracker showed the vice-president and Democratic nominee with a two-point nationwide lead, 48% to 46%, over her Republican opponent as of 10 October - tellingly, down from a 4% advantage she registered two weeks ago.\u201d Harris enjoys just three, fractional leads in Nevada and Michigan, and a slim one-point advantage in Pennsylvania. Trump has wafer-thin leads in the five remaining swing states \u2013 Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona. Despite Donald Trump\u2019s claims that immigrants are taking \u201cBlack jobs\u201d and \u201cHispanic jobs\u201d, government data shows that immigrant labor has grown the economy and promoted new opportunities for native-born workers, the Associated Press reports. Mass deportations like those Trump has advocated for could cost taxpayers up to a trillion dollars, economists say. Giovanni Peri, a labor economist at the University of California, Davis, told the AP that, because native-born workers and non-citizens often have different language and skill sets, immigrant workers take jobs that citizens are often unwilling to fill, like agriculture and food-production roles. He also added that \u201cwe have many more vacancies than workers in this type of manual labor. In fact, we need many more of them to fill these roles.\u201d Ethan Lewis, an economist at Dartmouth College, added: \u201cThere is a vast amount of research on the labor market impact of immigration in the US, most of which concludes the impact on less-skilled workers is fairly small and, if anything, jobs for US-born workers might by created rather than \u2018taken\u2019 by immigrants.\u201d Since the non-citizen labor force makes up roughly 4% of US GDP annually, Peri estimates that mass deportation would result in a roughly $1tn loss. At a private dinner with several billionaire donors in September, Donald Trump expressed frustration that Republicans had not raised more money for his campaign, the New York Times reports. The likes of hedge fund manager Paul Singer, investment banker Warren Stephens, businessman Joe Ricketts and former education secretary Betsy DeVos were all in attendance at the Trump Tower soiree, where Trump conveyed his annoyance that his campaign had not drawn larger donations \u2013 despite tax policies he said were favorable to the wealthy. In the less than three months that she\u2019s been in the presidential race, Kamala Harris has raised $1bn. That\u2019s allowed her to focus on campaigning in the final weeks of the race, while Trump continues attending fundraisers. In July, August and September, the vice-president raised twice as much as Trump. Back in Washington, Christian nationalists are gathering on the National Mall today to fast and pray, and denounce gender-affirming healthcare for trans youth. The Guardian\u2019s Alice Herman has the story: Less than a month before the presidential election, multilevel marketing professional-turned-Christian \u201capostle\u201d Jenny Donnelly is summoning women to the National Mall to fast, pray and uphold \u201cthe Lord\u2019s authority over the election process and our nation\u2019s leadership\u201d. It\u2019s the first of a series of Christian nationalist gatherings in DC to rally believers to the Capitol ahead of the 2024 election. The pro-Trump influencer has billed the event as a rallying call for mothers concerned about changing gender norms in modern America, gathering women under pink and blue banners emblazoned with the anti-trans hashtag #DontMessWithOurKids. In her promotional materials, Donnelly casts the event at the Capitol as an opportunity for women to stand their ground and play a pivotal role in changing the cultural and political trajectory of the US. In the wake of recent reporting that Donald Trump sent Covid-19 tests to Russia at the height of the pandemic \u2013 and Kamala Harris\u2019s criticism of that move \u2013 the Kremlin said today that Harris\u2019s description of Vladimir Putin as a \u201cmurderous dictator\u201d shows how politicians in Washington are seeking to impose their views on the world, Reuters reports. \u201cThe lofty political establishment of the United States of America, to all appearances, is infused with such a political culture,\u201d Russian news agencies have quoted Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov telling a television interviewer. \u201cThis is probably the quintessence of the very model of international relations that they are trying to foist on the entire world, a model that most in the world are beginning to like less and less.\u201d Tensions with Russia have been high in recent years, between the war in Ukraine and Russian election interference in 2016. Kamala Harris will travel to North Carolina for campaign events in Raleigh and Greenville today and tomorrow, according to her campaign. This evening, she will visit with local Black elected faith and community leaders in Raleigh, while also participating in a volunteer hurricane relief supply drive. Tomorrow, she\u2019ll attend a church service in Greenville, just days after launching her campaign\u2019s \u201cSouls to the Polls\u201d effort to turn out Black churchgoers. After campaigning in Las Vegas this afternoon, Trump will make a stop in Coachella, California. An agricultural town in southern California, Coachella is best known for hosting an internationally acclaimed arts and music festival. It\u2019s not the first place many people expected Trump to campaign, but the Coachella Valley\u2019s large community of migrant farm workers make it ripe for the former president to continue the anti-immigrant message he ramped up in Aurora, Colorado yesterday. Although Trump is unlikely to flip long-blue California, the rally will present an opportunity for him to rail against the state\u2019s Democratic leadership \u2013 as he did in Aurora, Colorado, yesterday. Tim Walz is trading the campaign trail for the prairies of Sleepy Eye, Minnesota, this morning as he kicks off pheasant-hunting season there. The vice-presidential nominee and Minnesota governor has dramatically shifted his stance on gun rights over the years \u2013 going from garnering an A rating from the NRA to straight F\u2019s as his children asked him to back gun-violence protections in the wake of several campus mass shootings. The Harris-Walz campaign has called for an assault weapons ban, while walking a fine line among gun owners in the United States. Both Harris and Walz have emphasized that they themselves are gun owners, with Harris saying on 60 Minutes this week that she owns a Glock. The biggest headline circulating this morning is Kamala Harris\u2019s medical report, which declares her fit for the presidency. For a closer look, here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s Ramon Antonio Vargas: A senior aide to Harris, 59, said the vice-president\u2019s advisers viewed the publication of the health report and medical history as an opportunity to call attention to questions about the Republican White House nominee Donald Trump\u2019s physical fitness and mental acuity. The 78-year-old Trump has also not released any information about his health, though he would be the oldest president elected if Americans give him a second term in the Oval Office. The report \u2013 in the form of a two-page letter from the vice-president\u2019s physician, Joshua Simmons \u2013 described Harris as being in \u201cexcellent health\u201d and asserted that her medical history was notable for seasonal allergies and hives. Harris manages those conditions with over-the-counter medications such as Allegra, Atrovent nasal spray and Pataday eye drops, and she has also been on allergen immunotherapy for three years, the letter said. Otherwise, Harris is mildly nearsighted and wears corrective contact lenses as a result, had abdominal surgery when she was three years old and has a maternal history of colon cancer. \u201cShe has no personal history of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cardiac disease, pulmonary disease, neurological disorders, cancer or osteoporosis,\u201d said the letter from Simmons, who added that the vice-president\u2019s most recent physical examination in April was \u201cunremarkable\u201d. The statement on Harris\u2019s health came on Saturday as Trump has become increasingly incoherent at campaign rallies, something the Guardian US reported on earlier in October. He has been slurring, stumbling over his words, hurling expletives \u2013 and showing signs of cognitive decline consistent with someone approaching his 80s, according to medical experts. Good morning and thanks for joining us this Saturday. With election day just over three weeks away, we\u2019ll be covering the latest developments as they happen. Here\u2019s a quick summary of the latest news from yesterday and where things stand today: At a rally in Aurora, Colorado, yesterday, former president Donald Trump announced \u201cOperation Aurora\u201d, a plan to invoke the 1798 Alien Enemies Act if he is re-elected. The law allows the president to detain and deport non\u2011citizens in times of a declared war or presidentially proclaimed \u201cinvasion\u201d. Meanwhile, speaking in Scottsdale, Arizona, Kamala Harris said she would create \u201ca bipartisan council of advisers\u201d if elected president. She\u2019s drawn remarkable support over the past two and a half months from establishment Republicans, most notably Liz and Dick Cheney. Also yesterday, Vogue magazine released its newest issue, featuring Harris on the cover. The photograph of the vice-president stood in stark contrast to Harris\u2019s first appearance on the magazine\u2019s cover three years ago \u2013 an image that was widely criticized as unserious and disrespectful. This morning, Harris released a report on her medical history \u2013 in contrast to her opponent who has repeatedly promised and then refused to do the same. The report concludes that Harris \u201cpossesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency\u201d. And Trump is scheduled to speak this afternoon at a Hispanic roundtable in Las Vegas. He\u2019s expected to return to the anti-immigrant message that has defined his campaign. In a change of scenery, Tim Walz is taking a break from the campaign trail today to kick of Minnesota\u2019s pheasant hunting season. He\u2019s spending the day at the Governor\u2019s Pheasant Opener \u2013 reiterating the Minnesota governor\u2019s reputation as a hunter despite his firm stance on gun violence regulations. Let\u2019s watch what happens.",

      "bodyText": "The flags on the Scottish parliament building were lowered on Saturday evening to mark the passing of Alex Salmond, who transformed the Scottish National party and led Scotland to the brink of independence as first minister. Voices cross-party and around the world rushed to praise the achievements of this consummate and divisive politician, who dominated the Scottish political landscape for decades. And within the SNP itself, which he moulded into a dynamic, confident, election-winning operation, there was shock and raw grief. But his post-referendum legacy was dominated by the collapse of the defining relationship of his political career with Nicola Sturgeon, who succeeded him as first minister and regarded him as her mentor. A decade on from that referendum, on Saturday there was also quiet reflection among SNP veterans on the bitter legacy of the events of the past seven years that caused Salmond to angrily quit his membership and found another pro-independence party \u2013 called Alba, the Gaelic for Scotland \u2013 to rival it. It was Sturgeon whom Salmond blamed for how the Scottish government handled initial complaints of sexual harassment made against him \u2013 resulting in a criminal trial in which he was sensationally acquitted of all charges \u2013 and a Holyrood inquiry. \u201cIt was a sundering among a comparatively small group of people who were very close and had taken the party to where it was,\u201d said Michael Russell, former Scottish government minister and SNP chief executive under Salmond, and another member of that inner circle along with the current first minister, John Swinney. \u201cIt was very hard but this is the moment to reflect on his achievements.\u201d \u201cThere was nobody to compare him to,\u201d said Russell, who was Salmond\u2019s campaign manager when he first became leader in 1990. \u201cThe party recognised early on that he was an exceptional talent.\u201d \u201cHe was on a personal campaign to convert every person in Scotland.

If the independence referendum of 2014 was the high-water mark of their relationship, after losing his Westminster seat in 2017 he refused to step back and take on the elder statesman role that was waiting for him, making things difficult for his successor.

Of the starting XI in Berlin, only Aymeric Laporte, Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz, Lamine Yamal and Morata began here.

All he was missing, the coach added, was a goal and that was because he had been denied by Schmeichel.</p>    <p>Denmark hadn\u2019t come to pay homage. Top of the group, they wanted to play their part and take their points. In front of 1,500 travelling fans, theirs was the first opportunity too, David Raya saving from Kasper Dolberg.</p> <p>Spain were on the front foot early on but real chances were few \u2013 an \u00c1lex Grimaldo shot was saved easily, Zubimendi poked a volley wide and Morata squeezed beyond the far post before Lamine Yamal\u2019s curler was stopped \u2013 and the intensity would drop. Denmark were starting to see a way through. \u201cWe did some good things in the first half,\u201d Knudsen said. Raya had to be swift after a sharp combination between Christian Eriksen and Albert Gr\u00f8nb\u00e6k and another exchange involving Eriksen and Dolberg saw the latter\u2019s cross almost fly in.

Next Lamine Yamal, clean through, hit over. The second period then opened with Ruiz striking the side netting. Spain dominated but it lacked a little edge, incision. Until, that was, Ruiz\u2019s lovely pass put Morata in.

Lamine\u2019s fast feet worked an opening, the teenager flashing off a shot that Schmeichel saved just as the first Mexican wave began its journey around the ground. Time was slipping away but they were determined to enjoy this anyway.

Summoned to Washington DC by the multilevel marketing professional-turned-Christian \u201capostle\u201d Jenny Donnelly and the anti-LGBTQ+ celebrity pastor Lou Engle, they streamed onto the lawn holding blue and pink banners emblazoned with the hashtag #DontMessWithOurKids \u2013 a nod to the myth that children are being indoctrinated into adopting gay and transgender identities. It was no coincidence that the event was held on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, or that many attendees carried shofars and Israeli flags: evangelicals and charismatic Christians find spiritual meaning in Old Testament scripture, Jewish rituals and support for Israel \u2013 where they believe the end times prophecy will take place. Although most of the day was spent in prayer and worship, November\u2019s presidential election hung heavy over the crowd.

Donnelly billed the event as a rallying call for mothers concerned about changing gender norms in the modern US and casting the gathering at the Capitol as an opportunity for women to stand their ground and play a pivotal role in changing the country\u2019s cultural and political trajectory. The rally is a collaboration organized by multiple far-right Christian leaders affiliated with the New Apostolic Reformation, a movement on the political far right that seeks to establish long-term Christian dominion over government and society as well as get Trump a second presidency in November. Matthew Taylor, a senior scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian and Jewish Studies, said the effort was aimed at \u201ccreating a network \u2013 a mass of people \u2013 who see it as their spiritual mission to take over Washington DC\u201d. Most prominent in the push to turn out women to the National Mall is Engle, a rightwing pastor and staunch opponent of LGBTQ+ rights and abortion, whose tutelage of anti-gay Ugandan pastors and coordination of mass prayer mobilizations has earned him international notoriety and celebrity. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which characterizes Engle as an anti-LGBTQ+ extremist, notes that Engle has in the past compared the anti-LGBTQ+ push to the secessionist south during the American civil war, calling on opponents of gay rights to emulate the Confederate general Robert E Lee, who \u201cwas able to restrain Washington\u201d.

      "body": "<p>History comes in all different shapes and sizes. Heck, there were two different pieces of history on the line here in what felt like one of the most absorbing Grand Finals in history during the buildup.</p> <p>But every now and then, there is a moment in time that surpasses all others. As Wigan lifted the Super League trophy aloft under the lights at Old Trafford, it was difficult not to think we were witnessing a moment that may not be seen again for some time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2024/oct/12/wigan-v-hull-kr-super-league-grand-final-2024-live-score-updates\">Wigan v Hull KR: Super League Grand Final 2024 \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Consider that, before this, only four teams in the 129-year history of rugby league had swept the board and won the four major trophies on offer to them in that particular season: Hunslet in 1907-08, Huddersfield in 1914-15, Swinton in 1927-28 and Wigan in 1994-95. Matt Peet\u2019s side added their name to that exclusive list to become the first team in the Super League era to win a grand slam.</p> <p>While there is an argument that teams from different eras should not be compared, this Wigan side must now be considered one of the greatest ever. In a salary-capped sport, for one club to win every domestic trophy on offer in a single season is nothing short of sensational.</p> <p>And there was an eerie warning to the rest from Peet after the match. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the end,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got so much more learning to do and so much more to build connection-wise. I think it\u2019s for others to make comparisons, there have been some very good teams.\u201d</p> <p>Having already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/feb/24/wigan-penrith-world-club-challenge-rugby-league-match-report\">won the World Club Challenge</a> in February, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/08/warrington-wigan-challenge-cup-final-rugby-league-report\">Challenge Cup at Wembley in June</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/19/wigan-salford-super-league-rugby-league-match-report#:~:text=Wigan%20retain%20League%20Leaders'%20Shield%20with%20rout%20of%20depleted%20Salford,-Wigan%2064%2D0&amp;text=Wigan%20are%20no%20strangers%20to,for%20all%20the%20right%20reasons.\">League Leaders\u2019 Shield</a> a little over three weeks ago, you always felt it would take something special from Hull KR \u2013 themselves bidding for a slice of history \u2013 to prevent the inevitable.</p> <p>In testing conditions, this was an attritional game. But that is exactly what Wigan like; they have made it their business to win matches of this nature, where the margins can be fine and the stakes at their highest. The decisive play came midway through an absorbing first half, when you sensed the wind disappearing from Hull KR\u2019s sails in one moment of brilliance.</p> <p>Rovers had dominated the opening quarter in terms of territory but had little to show for it. Then, with Wigan mounting their first meaningful attack, Bevan French stepped off his right foot to puncture the Hull KR line before doing the same again to bamboozle Niall Evalds and open the scoring in sensational fashion.</p> <p>On a night when French became the recipient of the inaugural Rob Burrow Award for player of the match, it was a fitting moment, given how Burrow scored an equally superb try here 13 years earlier. When Harry Smith kicked a drop goal on the stroke of half-time to make it 7-0 and open up a two-score lead, it felt like a significant margin.</p>    <p>\u201cHe can do things other players can\u2019t,\u201d the beaten coach, Willie Peters, said of French. \u201cWigan are still the leaders in this competition and they showed it again tonight.\u201d</p> <p>For the Robins, who earned so many admirers throughout 2024, this was a game too far. Bottom of Super League in 2020, they have emerged as a force this year but their wait for a first trophy since 1985 continues.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m extremely proud to be head coach of this team,\u201d Peters said afterwards. \u201cThe players didn\u2019t let anyone down tonight.\u201d As he pointed out, the Smith drop goal was a big moment.

      "bodyText": "History comes in all different shapes and sizes. Heck, there were two different pieces of history on the line here in what felt like one of the most absorbing Grand Finals in history during the buildup. But every now and then, there is a moment in time that surpasses all others. As Wigan lifted the Super League trophy aloft under the lights at Old Trafford, it was difficult not to think we were witnessing a moment that may not be seen again for some time. Consider that, before this, only four teams in the 129-year history of rugby league had swept the board and won the four major trophies on offer to them in that particular season: Hunslet in 1907-08, Huddersfield in 1914-15, Swinton in 1927-28 and Wigan in 1994-95. Matt Peet\u2019s side added their name to that exclusive list to become the first team in the Super League era to win a grand slam. While there is an argument that teams from different eras should not be compared, this Wigan side must now be considered one of the greatest ever. In a salary-capped sport, for one club to win every domestic trophy on offer in a single season is nothing short of sensational. And there was an eerie warning to the rest from Peet after the match. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the end,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got so much more learning to do and so much more to build connection-wise. I think it\u2019s for others to make comparisons, there have been some very good teams.\u201d Having already won the World Club Challenge in February, the Challenge Cup at Wembley in June and the League Leaders\u2019 Shield a little over three weeks ago, you always felt it would take something special from Hull KR \u2013 themselves bidding for a slice of history \u2013 to prevent the inevitable. In testing conditions, this was an attritional game. But that is exactly what Wigan like; they have made it their business to win matches of this nature, where the margins can be fine and the stakes at their highest. The decisive play came midway through an absorbing first half, when you sensed the wind disappearing from Hull KR\u2019s sails in one moment of brilliance. Rovers had dominated the opening quarter in terms of territory but had little to show for it. Then, with Wigan mounting their first meaningful attack, Bevan French stepped off his right foot to puncture the Hull KR line before doing the same again to bamboozle Niall Evalds and open the scoring in sensational fashion. On a night when French became the recipient of the inaugural Rob Burrow Award for player of the match, it was a fitting moment, given how Burrow scored an equally superb try here 13 years earlier. When Harry Smith kicked a drop goal on the stroke of half-time to make it 7-0 and open up a two-score lead, it felt like a significant margin. \u201cHe can do things other players can\u2019t,\u201d the beaten coach, Willie Peters, said of French. \u201cWigan are still the leaders in this competition and they showed it again tonight.\u201d For the Robins, who earned so many admirers throughout 2024, this was a game too far. Bottom of Super League in 2020, they have emerged as a force this year but their wait for a first trophy since 1985 continues. \u201cI\u2019m extremely proud to be head coach of this team,\u201d Peters said afterwards. \u201cThe players didn\u2019t let anyone down tonight.\u201d As he pointed out, the Smith drop goal was a big moment. Conditions deteriorated after half-time, making penetrating a resolute Wigan defence an impossible ask. This Wigan side are renowned for closing out contests when they are ahead. Unfortunately for Rovers and their 20,000-strong army of travelling supporters, they did not really have much of a spark to even suggest a comeback could be possible. A penalty from Mikey Lewis reduced Wigan\u2019s lead to five points but four minutes later Adam Keighran responded to make the gap seven again. That left the remaining 15 minutes feeling more like a procession than a grandstand finale. From there, Wigan did what Wigan now so often do: see it out with minimal fuss to cement their place in history.",

      "body": "<p>Dean and I met in 1967 at the University of Adelaide when we were 18 years old and in the second year of our science degrees. We worked back to back in the biochemistry laboratory. I soon discovered to my delight that he was on top of the subject and could answer my questions. I remember thinking: \u201cThis man is smart, and useful.\u201d Soon I would \u201caccidentally\u201d come across him at the cafeteria, library and bookshop. Eventually he asked me out but we only dated for a few months. There was no drama. We drifted apart. He told me later he found me too frivolous; I found him too serious.</p> <p>Fast forward two years and we were both studying for our honours. We began running into each other late at night in the library and we fell back into comfortable conversation. My mother noticed that he was being mentioned more often and invited him to my 21st birthday party. He looked so handsome at the door holding a big bunch of flowers, and got on so easily with my friends. As he climbed into his car to leave, he asked me out to the movies.</p> <p>A week later we were early to the movie session, so we window-shopped. We talked and talked; he had such wide interests. Every time he spoke I learned something. He was kind and quietly self-confident and I sensed a gentle strength about him. He wasn\u2019t as serious as I thought. I could make him laugh \u2013 the ultimate compliment. I was filled with joy. I didn\u2019t want the window-shopping to end.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019d both retire to his bedroom and shut the door \u2013 to listen to classical music</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That night he took me to see Charly, with Cliff Robertson; later, it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/21/space-odyssey-kubrick-science-fiction\">2001: A Space Odyssey</a>. Maybe it was a test since science fiction was one of his passions. If so, I passed.</p> <p>Being with Dean was so intellectually stimulating. He opened up new worlds for me. I began to work through his science fiction library. I\u2019d have dinner with his family and then we\u2019d both retire to his bedroom and shut the door \u2013 to listen to classical music. The family said later they wondered what we were doing. Beethoven!</p> <p>We shared an interest in astronomy and combined our meagre savings to buy a telescope. He understood the scientific and technical aspects; I knew my way around the sky and could show him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/sep/15/saturns-rings-the-remnants-of-a-moon-that-strayed-too-close-say-scientists\">Saturn\u2019s rings</a>. His main hobby was shell collecting, and his idea of the perfect date was us crawling on our stomachs along the beach, looking for tiny shells. It became my favourite activity. We became inseparable.</p>    <p>Dean was reserved, independent and hid his emotions. I didn\u2019t expect declarations of undying love. About three months into our relationship, he went away to a week-long science conference \u2013 I told him I\u2019d miss him. His reply: \u201cI\u2019m going to have a good time.\u201d</p> <p>I met the bus when he returned, waiting excitedly at the stop late at night. As he came down the bus steps, I realised he looked a little pale and seedy. We hugged. Then as we turned to leave he said, \u201cI missed you\u201d, not looking at me, not in a romantic way but almost defiant. How dare I get under his skin! How dare I force him to express an emotion! I took a moment to process what he\u2019d said and then the words hit me like a thunderbolt. That\u2019s when I knew he loved me. And he\u2019d broken through a hangover to express it.</p> <p>He was never going to get rid of me after that. We went back to our respective homes and I think he must have slept well but I was possessed by a happy restlessness.</p>    <p>We married in 1971 (I asked him) and have been together for 53 years. What I didn\u2019t perhaps appreciate at first was Dean\u2019s kindness, patience, respect for others and loyalty. His calmness balanced my more outgoing personality. He did half the housework and eventually took over the cooking. He was a hands-on parent to our daughter from the start, changing nappies and comforting a restless baby all night. This was not so common for men in the 1970s! He nursed me through two bouts of breast cancer. Older people called on him to help with odd jobs and computer wrangling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jun/09/the-moment-i-knew-i-burst-into-the-living-room-with-his-letter-held-high-and-screeched-im-getting-married\">The moment I knew: I burst into the living room with his letter held high and screeched, \u2018I\u2019m getting married!\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course we sometimes clashed.

Love is knowing there\u2019s always someone who\u2019s on your side.</p> <p>It\u2019s been a life of adventure, travel, learning and sharing. We loved the outdoors. We studied and wrote about nature, and spread the conservation message. We\u2019ve experienced ancient fossil sites, active volcanoes and the Arctic tundra; camped alone in a vast red desert, hiked the Rocky Mountains, and journeyed to places in Kyoto mentioned in ancient Japanese literature.

      "bodyText": "Dean and I met in 1967 at the University of Adelaide when we were 18 years old and in the second year of our science degrees. We worked back to back in the biochemistry laboratory. I soon discovered to my delight that he was on top of the subject and could answer my questions. I remember thinking: \u201cThis man is smart, and useful.\u201d Soon I would \u201caccidentally\u201d come across him at the cafeteria, library and bookshop. Eventually he asked me out but we only dated for a few months. There was no drama. We drifted apart. He told me later he found me too frivolous; I found him too serious. Fast forward two years and we were both studying for our honours. We began running into each other late at night in the library and we fell back into comfortable conversation. My mother noticed that he was being mentioned more often and invited him to my 21st birthday party. He looked so handsome at the door holding a big bunch of flowers, and got on so easily with my friends. As he climbed into his car to leave, he asked me out to the movies. A week later we were early to the movie session, so we window-shopped. We talked and talked; he had such wide interests. Every time he spoke I learned something. He was kind and quietly self-confident and I sensed a gentle strength about him. He wasn\u2019t as serious as I thought. I could make him laugh \u2013 the ultimate compliment. I was filled with joy. I didn\u2019t want the window-shopping to end. That night he took me to see Charly, with Cliff Robertson; later, it was 2001: A Space Odyssey. Maybe it was a test since science fiction was one of his passions. If so, I passed. Being with Dean was so intellectually stimulating. He opened up new worlds for me. I began to work through his science fiction library. I\u2019d have dinner with his family and then we\u2019d both retire to his bedroom and shut the door \u2013 to listen to classical music. The family said later they wondered what we were doing. Beethoven! We shared an interest in astronomy and combined our meagre savings to buy a telescope. He understood the scientific and technical aspects; I knew my way around the sky and could show him Saturn\u2019s rings. His main hobby was shell collecting, and his idea of the perfect date was us crawling on our stomachs along the beach, looking for tiny shells. It became my favourite activity. We became inseparable. Dean was reserved, independent and hid his emotions. I didn\u2019t expect declarations of undying love. About three months into our relationship, he went away to a week-long science conference \u2013 I told him I\u2019d miss him. His reply: \u201cI\u2019m going to have a good time.\u201d I met the bus when he returned, waiting excitedly at the stop late at night. As he came down the bus steps, I realised he looked a little pale and seedy. We hugged. Then as we turned to leave he said, \u201cI missed you\u201d, not looking at me, not in a romantic way but almost defiant. How dare I get under his skin! How dare I force him to express an emotion! I took a moment to process what he\u2019d said and then the words hit me like a thunderbolt. That\u2019s when I knew he loved me. And he\u2019d broken through a hangover to express it. He was never going to get rid of me after that. We went back to our respective homes and I think he must have slept well but I was possessed by a happy restlessness. We married in 1971 (I asked him) and have been together for 53 years. What I didn\u2019t perhaps appreciate at first was Dean\u2019s kindness, patience, respect for others and loyalty. His calmness balanced my more outgoing personality. He did half the housework and eventually took over the cooking. He was a hands-on parent to our daughter from the start, changing nappies and comforting a restless baby all night. This was not so common for men in the 1970s! He nursed me through two bouts of breast cancer. Older people called on him to help with odd jobs and computer wrangling. Of course we sometimes clashed. I was neat and he was messy. He was cautious, I was more impulsive. We were both stubborn but we learned to say \u201csorry\u201d and mean it. Most of all, we had such fun. Love is knowing there\u2019s always someone who\u2019s on your side. It\u2019s been a life of adventure, travel, learning and sharing. We loved the outdoors. We studied and wrote about nature, and spread the conservation message. We\u2019ve experienced ancient fossil sites, active volcanoes and the Arctic tundra; camped alone in a vast red desert, hiked the Rocky Mountains, and journeyed to places in Kyoto mentioned in ancient Japanese literature. After retiring from our science careers, I worked on the moth collection in Museums Victoria. Dean was down the corridor working on shells. I\u2019m now the only one who carries these memories. Dean has severe dementia and is in a home. When I visit he recognises me occasionally. Then he smiles and takes my hand. We walk in the garden of the home and, as always, our love for the outdoors brings us together.",

After 2012, the landslide win by Campbell Newman, the LNP quickly became unstuck by factional warfare. The party\u2019s MPs went to war with its organisational wing.</p> \n<p>The nature of the 2012 landslide also meant the election of new MPs who the party might not have expected to win.

With the LNP cruising in the polls, moderates had held out hope of beating Labor in middle suburban seats \u2013 Ferny Grove, Stafford, Mansfield, Mount Ommaney and Aspley \u2013 areas beyond the reach of Greens insurgency, but still places where votes have more \u201csmall-l\u201d liberal values. Many of these areas vote for the LNP at local and federal elections but are Labor strongholds in the state parliament. A Labor source says the reality is the state LNP is \u201cway too wacko for Brisbane to stomach\u201d. The added concern for LNP moderates is the potential makeup of the LNP party room after the election, if the party wins regional or city fringe seats but not Brisbane ones. \u201cWe need moderates in the next parliament,\u201d one party member says. Prospect of a conscience vote Party sources say the \u201cChristian soldiers\u201d grouping within the LNP has relatively little influence within the current state parliamentary team. There are really only two hardcore members of the Christian right in the LNP party room \u2013 the retiring rightwinger Mark Robinson and the veteran Sunshine Coast MP Fiona Simpson. Others often attributed as being associated with the faction, such as Tim Mander or Christian Rowan, are more neatly aligned with Peter Dutton\u2019s mainstream conservative grouping. But before elections, factions always battle for influence. Robinson is handing his seat to Stoker, the former federal senator and figurehead of the Christian right. Candidates who have won preselection for winnable LNP seats include several who have a history of opposing abortion rights, or with links to Pentecostal churches. Particularly concerning to LNP moderates is the recent takeover of a large inner-city party division \u2013 and the attempted takeover of another \u2013 by the Christian right. The party\u2019s Griffith federal divisional council \u2013 covering Queensland\u2019s most progressive federal seat \u2013 is now helmed by Alan Baker, a veteran of anti-abortion campaigns in the state. Baker sent a pre-election email on party letterhead saying the government had been \u201ccaptured by transgender ideology\u201d. \u201cFringe infiltrators can see an election victory around the corner and are desperate to increase their influence,\u201d an LNP source said at the time Baker won control of the branch. With polls still pointing to a comfortable LNP win, the risk for Crisafulli is that the prospect of a conscience vote \u2013 brought about by Katter \u2013 serves to highlight internal conflicts that have been paused, rather than solved. The opposition leader won\u2019t say publicly whether he would allow a conscience vote, in line with party convention. The federal MP Colin Boyce said it would be \u201cextraordinary\u201d not to. Crisafulli\u2019s backers are mostly moderates, and MPs say the opposition has been \u201cremarkably united\u201d during the past term. But they also acknowledge that concern about abortion springs from \u201clegitimate concern about what happens when we get in\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s also difficult because we don\u2019t have a track record to point back to,\u201d the MP says. \u201cWe obviously try not to hark back to the Newman years.\u201d In more than three decades, the conservatives have only won one Queensland election. After 2012, the landslide win by Campbell Newman, the LNP quickly became unstuck by factional warfare. The party\u2019s MPs went to war with its organisational wing. The nature of the 2012 landslide also meant the election of new MPs who the party might not have expected to win. A state that voted for Newman, framed as a more moderate Liberal, wound up with a party room that veered more conservative and pushed that agenda in government. Griffith University political scientist and commentator Paul Williams says he expects those sorts of internal issues to come to the fore within 12 months of an LNP election win. \u201cThose things are still there in the background,\u201d he said. \u2018Not part of the plan\u2019 LNP figures predicted Labor attacks about abortion when Stoker \u2013 who lost her Senate seat in 2022 \u2013 was preselected to run in Oodgeroo. Stoker announced herself to the public with a firebrand speech on the Senate floor, describing Queensland\u2019s abortion decriminalisation laws as \u201cbarbarism [with] the cloak of civility\u201d. In 2022, she told the Conservative Political Action Conference the Coalition would be in opposition for a \u201cvery long time\u201d if it did not focus on conservative social issues. But since being announced as a candidate, Stoker has been uncharacteristically quiet as the LNP attempts to stifle intensifying debate about abortion and other social issues, and instead focus on kitchen-table ones. Her appearances on Sky News and rightwing podcasts and anti-abortion rallies have all been replaced with community breakfasts and visits to small businesses. Asked on Thursday whether she would support changes to Labor\u2019s 2018 abortion laws, Stoker used the party line: \u201cIt\u2019s not part of our plan, the LNP has ruled it out.\u201d The LNP\u2019s continued refusal to engage beyond its rehearsed line \u2013 that abortion reform is \u201cnot part of our plan\u201d \u2013 now risks backfiring amid ramping pressure from different sides of the debate. At a pre-election meeting of a conservative Christian group last month, attenders were urged to email, call or speak to candidates and \u201cjust ask them the question: how would you vote if abortion came up\u201d. \u201cThe fact you say that puts it in their mind that abortion is an election issue,\u201d the forum moderator said. The LNP has not responded to the Australian Christian Lobby\u2019s pre-election survey, which includes questions about abortion. The pro-choice service Children by Choice also sent questions to every state MP asking whether they supported, and would protect, ongoing access to termination of pregnancy. None have responded. \u201cIt feels ominous, it\u2019s a scary position,\u201d says Jill McKay, the chief executive officer of Children by Choice. \u201cIt\u2019s a very simple question. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to polarise who people vote for, but it is a very deep concern that one of our major political parties is unable to present to Queensland what their policies are. \u201cWomen who vote for the LNP need to access abortion. Women who vote for the ALP need to access abortion. Women who vote for the Greens need to access abortion.\u201d LNP sources acknowledge that the Katter plan to bring the issue to the next parliament \u201cfucks us\u201d. \u201c[Crisafulli] needs to come out and say something more definitive,\u201d one party source says. But another warns that sticking to the agreed lines remains the only tactic that could keep the informal stability arrangement in place. \u201cThe discipline that this whole campaign has been built on would dissolve in a second,\u201d the source says.",

      "body": "<p>Est\u00eav\u00e3o didn\u2019t think twice about how to celebrate his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/18/chelsea-close-to-securing-60m-transfer-for-palmeiras-youngster-estevao-willian\">move to Chelsea</a>. As soon as he had signed from Palmeiras<strong> </strong>in a deal that could top \u00a351m, the Brazilian decided to honour Cole Palmer and usher in what could be a new era for the English club.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I signed for Chelsea, the next day I scored a goal and celebrated like Palmer. His celebration was trend, very popular,\u201d says Est\u00eav\u00e3o before discussing his first interaction with the England forward. \u201cWe talked on social media, I tagged him on Instagram, he called me a star, I said he\u2019s a star too. He said we\u2019re going to do a lot of great things together for Chelsea.\u201d</p> <p>Palmer\u2019s promise to his future teammate may come as a surprise to many, but not to those who have been following Est\u00eav\u00e3o\u2019s progress in Brazil. At the age of 17 he is the country\u2019s most exciting young talent since Neymar. </p> <p>In addition to his performances, which have been described as superior to those of Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior and Endrick at the same age, the prodigy also exhibits less exotic behaviour than his predecessors, who have adopted a more public profile surrounded by celebrities.</p> <p>Big names in the Brazil national team have also been impressed by Est\u00eav\u00e3o. Called up for the first time recently for the games against Ecuador and Paraguay, which Brazil won and lost 1-0 respectively, he presented his calling card to the country\u2019s No&nbsp;1 goalkeeper. \u201cIn shooting training, I started to hit all the shots and Alisson got a bit angry. He said he was still warming up, that I should wait a little bit. But I took it a bit seriously and scored many goals [against] him,\u201d Est\u00eav\u00e3o laughs. \u201cHe took it all in jest, but I hope that next year I can do again against him in [Premier League] matches. We\u2019ll see a lot of each other in England.\u201d</p>    <p>Est\u00eav\u00e3o used his talent to overcome his nervousness over being called up to his country\u2019s senior ranks. \u201cThe first few days you get nervous, there\u2019s no way round it. You get more shy, but then you start to get more intimate and chat to the guys in training,\u201d he says. \u201cThis helps a lot because on the pitch you show that you have potential and why you\u2019re there. Then it becomes easier and they start to accept you.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time as having to deal with the stars of world football, Est\u00eav\u00e3o also has teenage things to attend to, such as schoolwork, which he considers even more difficult than his football opponents. \u201cSchool is the rest of my day. It\u2019s not easy,\u201d he beams. \u201cThere are some very difficult subjects. Physics is the hardest. It\u2019s very difficult to remember the formulas, how to work it out.\u201d</p> <p>Since the beginning of the year, Est\u00eav\u00e3o has been taking online classes because of Palmeiras\u2019 training and match schedule. When&nbsp;he moves to Chelsea next year, he will need to maintain his school routine. \u201cI will study in London as well,\u201d Est\u00eav\u00e3o says. \u201cBut I will continue at the same school, I will continue studying online, like&nbsp;nowadays.\u201d</p> <p>Despite not being an exemplary student, Est\u00eav\u00e3o misses going to school and socialising with people his own age. \u201cAt Palmeiras, I end up seeing the same person every day. When you\u2019re at school, you see lots of different students, your class is always changing, new people are joining the school,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have your best friend there. I miss that. At school there are people with the same age as me too. At football, they are older, more experienced people. Everyone treats me well, but it\u2019s different.\u201d</p>    <p>The move to London will be the fourth of Est\u00eav\u00e3o\u2019s life. Born in Franca, in the countryside of S\u00e3o Paulo, he moved to Belo Horizonte at the age of eight to play for Cruzeiro. From a poor background, he remembers the difficulties of that&nbsp;time and compares them to going to London.</p> <p>\u201cThe hardest move was from Franca to Belo Horizonte,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was the first time, I was very young, it meant being away from my&nbsp;family, the people I liked, school. It was a very different environment, a very different time. The journey was very difficult. I remember we managed to get the whole move in a&nbsp;van and a lorry came behind. It was a big struggle. Now London will be easier. You don\u2019t have to take things in the van, you can buy everything there.\u201d</p> <p>Est\u00eav\u00e3o has been dealing with fame since the age of 10, when he was featured in a television report. The appearance brought him into the national spotlight and led to the signing of his first contract with a sports equipment company. That deal also raised doubts about his future, with many fearing Est\u00eav\u00e3o\u2019s early fame would hinder his rise. \u201cIt all happened very quickly, but my parents helped me a lot,\u201d he says \u201cThey shielded me from everything that came from outside. I never had much contact with what was going on, what people were saying or thinking about it. I\u2019m very grateful to my parents for everything they did for me because that shielding was very important.</p> <p>\u201cMy father [Ivo] helps me more on the pitch, my mother [Hetiene] helps me off it. She helped me understand things about the day, life, the importance of eating well and to adapt to each new place. We\u2019ve moved around a lot. She\u2019s always done everything for me. Can you imagine leaving home, being away from your parents, to build a dream with me like my mum did? My mum plays a fundamental role in my life. She\u2019s the one who charges me on a daily basis and helps me understand life better.\u201d</p> <p>Raised in a deeply religious environment, Est\u00eav\u00e3o learned to play the drums in church and uses music to help him concentrate and relax before matches. \u201cI learned to play the drums when I was about six, seven years old,\u201d he says. \u201cI saw a friend of my father\u2019s playing in church and I started to like it. Music helps me a lot. I grew up in church, I listen to a lot of gospel music. I always listen to it before matches. But I listen to my own music, if I listen to my mates\u2019 music, I\u2019m lost. The guys like really dirty music.\u201d</p> <p>For many years, Est\u00eav\u00e3o has been dubbed <em>Messinho</em>: \u201cLittle Messi\u201d. It is a label and comparison that bothers the Brazilian but he admits the Argentinian is his great inspiration. \u201cI like Neymar a lot too, Cristiano Ronaldo. But my reference is [Lionel] Messi for everything he\u2019s done for football,\u201d Est\u00eav\u00e3o says. \u201cThe way he plays and what he does off the pitch is a guy I always have to look up to. And, of course, for me being left-footed like him favours as well.</p> <p>\u201cSome people are born with talent, others have to work hard. Good examples are Messi and Ronaldo. Messi has the talent, Ronaldo the effort. I look for both. Talent and dedication. Today in football you have to dedicate yourself, you have to keep to a schedule, train, travel, take care of yourself. You have to give up a lot. Without dedication you can\u2019t get anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>Est\u00eav\u00e3o can emphasise the importance of effort, but quality makes the difference. He is proof of that. \u201cI started out as a goalkeeper because my father was a goalkeeper,\u201d says Est\u00eav\u00e3o. </p> <p>\u201cI used to go to games with him, the games were on dirt pitches. I saw him playing a lot. I liked watching him and then I started to like it, I wanted to be a goalkeeper because of him, but later I decided to play on the line. It was a good decision to have switched positions, otherwise I certainly wouldn\u2019t be where I am today.\u201d</p> <p>Coveted by many big clubs in European football, Est\u00eav\u00e3o opted for Chelsea and is looking forward to joining them ahead of next season. \u201cI decided for Chelsea because of their planning. I was very pleased with that,\u201d he says. \u201cNot just for me, but also for my family. It was the club that believed in me and trusted in my work. I hope I can pay that back.\u201d</p> <p>One of the plans offered to Est\u00eav\u00e3o was the chance to play as a No&nbsp;10, the position in which he played at youth level, rather than as a right winger, whereas he has appeared for Palmeiras and the Brazil national team. </p> <p>Does he worry, however, that he will not prove a success at Stamford Bridge, as was the case for Kevin De Bruyne, Mohamed Salah and Romelu Lukaku? \u201cThat doesn\u2019t worry me because each one is different,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know the context or what they were like. I\u2019m going to have to find my space and I\u2019m going to have to give my all effort every day.\u201d</p> <p>Est\u00eav\u00e3o is still so young but having achieved so much already he has a clear mind with regards to his future, not to mention big ambitions. \u201cI want to win titles and show all my potential, show everything I can do,\u201d he says. \u201cChampion of the World Cup, Premier League and Champions League. That\u2019s what I want.</p> <p>\u201cMy biggest dream is to be the best player in the world. That\u2019s my dream. One day I\u2019ll be among the best. But I\u2019m not going to promise or project that I\u2019ll achieve this in a few years. It\u2019ll come naturally.\u201d</p>",

But my reference is [Lionel] Messi for everything he\u2019s done for football,\u201d Est\u00eav\u00e3o says. \u201cThe way he plays and what he does off the pitch is a guy I always have to look up to. And, of course, for me being left-footed like him favours as well. \u201cSome people are born with talent, others have to work hard. Good examples are Messi and Ronaldo. Messi has the talent, Ronaldo the effort. I look for both. Talent and dedication. Today in football you have to dedicate yourself, you have to keep to a schedule, train, travel, take care of yourself. You have to give up a lot. Without dedication you can\u2019t get anywhere.\u201d Est\u00eav\u00e3o can emphasise the importance of effort, but quality makes the difference. He is proof of that. \u201cI started out as a goalkeeper because my father was a goalkeeper,\u201d says Est\u00eav\u00e3o. \u201cI used to go to games with him, the games were on dirt pitches. I saw him playing a lot. I liked watching him and then I started to like it, I wanted to be a goalkeeper because of him, but later I decided to play on the line. It was a good decision to have switched positions, otherwise I certainly wouldn\u2019t be where I am today.\u201d Coveted by many big clubs in European football, Est\u00eav\u00e3o opted for Chelsea and is looking forward to joining them ahead of next season. \u201cI decided for Chelsea because of their planning. I was very pleased with that,\u201d he says. \u201cNot just for me, but also for my family. It was the club that believed in me and trusted in my work. I hope I can pay that back.\u201d One of the plans offered to Est\u00eav\u00e3o was the chance to play as a No 10, the position in which he played at youth level, rather than as a right winger, whereas he has appeared for Palmeiras and the Brazil national team. Does he worry, however, that he will not prove a success at Stamford Bridge, as was the case for Kevin De Bruyne, Mohamed Salah and Romelu Lukaku? \u201cThat doesn\u2019t worry me because each one is different,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know the context or what they were like. I\u2019m going to have to find my space and I\u2019m going to have to give my all effort every day.\u201d Est\u00eav\u00e3o is still so young but having achieved so much already he has a clear mind with regards to his future, not to mention big ambitions. \u201cI want to win titles and show all my potential, show everything I can do,\u201d he says. \u201cChampion of the World Cup, Premier League and Champions League. That\u2019s what I want. \u201cMy biggest dream is to be the best player in the world. That\u2019s my dream. One day I\u2019ll be among the best. But I\u2019m not going to promise or project that I\u2019ll achieve this in a few years. It\u2019ll come naturally.\u201d",

      "body": "<p><strong>You\u2019re a judge on this year\u2019s Dessert Masters. What are you secretly the master of?</strong></p> <p>I am the master of dodging a question. I feel like the last couple of years have been a good time to flex my media training. You don\u2019t always want to, as human beings, share everything of who you are. I feel like I can say what I want to say, but keep a little bit for myself. And I think that\u2019s something we should all be good at doing: holding a little bit back for ourselves and our loved ones.</p> <p><strong>What is the most memorable dessert you have ever eaten?</strong></p> <p>An experimental dessert I had in Slovenia a couple of years ago by Ana Ro\u0161 at Hi\u0161a Franko in the So\u010da Valley. She was working on a dessert that involved beef fat ice-cream. Being in rural Slovenia, it was all about finding interesting ways to use everything she has available to her. And that wasn\u2019t a finished dish. There was a little bit of graininess still involved in the churning of the beef fat into ice-cream, but it was delicious nonetheless. There\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/11/business/ana-ros-michelin-woman-chef.html\">Chef\u2019s Table</a> about her from a couple of years ago.</p> <p><strong>If you had a sandwich named after you, what would be in it?</strong></p> <p>If I think about the sandwich I really want to eat right now, it\u2019s marinated artichoke, mortadella, sopressa, fontina; I\u2019m thinking pickled Italian vegetable deli roll.</p> <p>One of the best sandwiches I\u2019ve ever had in my entire life is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/may/28/yotam-ottolenghi-recipes-for-the-perfect-picnic-muffuletta-sandwich-pea-horseradish-dip-yuzu-lime-brown-butter-mochi-madeleines\">muffuletta</a>. I had it from Central Grocery, which is the originator of it in New Orleans. When I went to order the sandwich I said: \u201cOne sandwich.\u201d And the guy just looked at me like I was insane. When he gave me the sandwich, I realised why \u2013 it\u2019s the entire loaf, so it feeds about six people. I was just travelling with one other person, and over the period of the next couple of days, every time we would come home a little bit sauced we just ate a bit more sandwich. A good deli sandwich is a thing of beauty.</p>    <p><strong>What do you do when you can\u2019t get to sleep?</strong></p> <p>I do battle with insomnia from time to time. I\u2019m one of those \u2013 I listen to creepy stories from Reddit being read in a monotone voice. I\u2019ve been listening to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/apr/08/patric-gagne-sociopath-fighting-urges\">Patric Gagne</a>\u2019s book Sociopath: A Memoir, and it is voiced by the author. She ends up getting a doctorate in psychology<strong>,</strong> specialising in sociopathy, and she\u2019s the most self-aware sociopath I\u2019ve ever heard of. She\u2019s explaining<strong>,</strong> from the driver\u2019s seat<strong>,</strong> what it\u2019s like to be her<strong>,</strong> and what she can feel and what she can\u2019t. It\u2019s very interesting but also helps me go to sleep because the sociopath is out there and in my ears, but not in my house.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the oldest thing you own, and why do you still have it?</strong></p> <p>I think with Chinese custom we tend to get rid of stuff, because new means auspicious. So I don\u2019t tend to hold on to a lot; I\u2019m pretty good when I move house. But if I really think about it, it\u2019s probably a bracelet I inherited from my grandmother on my father\u2019s side, which is two dragon heads interlocked.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s been your most cringeworthy run-in with a celebrity?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s with Luke McGregor, who has become a friend of mine now! A couple of Logies ago, I was wearing a dress with gloves that extended into sleeves, so there was no gap to take your hand out. Gorgeous, gorgeous gown. He shook my hand, and he\u2019s like: \u201cHow are you going to go to the loo in that dress?\u201d And I didn\u2019t really think about that when I tried it on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/oct/06/zoe-foster-blake-id-fight-moo-deng-she-would-win\">Zo\u00eb Foster Blake: \u2018I\u2019d fight Moo Deng. She would win\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Luke is so lovingly awkward, and so am I, which is why we ended up bonding. We workshopped how I was going to go to the loo in this dress, and the answer was not to drink much water or anything at all so I didn\u2019t have to go.

      "bodyText": "You\u2019re a judge on this year\u2019s Dessert Masters. What are you secretly the master of? I am the master of dodging a question. I feel like the last couple of years have been a good time to flex my media training. You don\u2019t always want to, as human beings, share everything of who you are. I feel like I can say what I want to say, but keep a little bit for myself. And I think that\u2019s something we should all be good at doing: holding a little bit back for ourselves and our loved ones. What is the most memorable dessert you have ever eaten? An experimental dessert I had in Slovenia a couple of years ago by Ana Ro\u0161 at Hi\u0161a Franko in the So\u010da Valley. She was working on a dessert that involved beef fat ice-cream. Being in rural Slovenia, it was all about finding interesting ways to use everything she has available to her. And that wasn\u2019t a finished dish. There was a little bit of graininess still involved in the churning of the beef fat into ice-cream, but it was delicious nonetheless. There\u2019s a Chef\u2019s Table about her from a couple of years ago. If you had a sandwich named after you, what would be in it? If I think about the sandwich I really want to eat right now, it\u2019s marinated artichoke, mortadella, sopressa, fontina; I\u2019m thinking pickled Italian vegetable deli roll. One of the best sandwiches I\u2019ve ever had in my entire life is a muffuletta. I had it from Central Grocery, which is the originator of it in New Orleans. When I went to order the sandwich I said: \u201cOne sandwich.\u201d And the guy just looked at me like I was insane. When he gave me the sandwich, I realised why \u2013 it\u2019s the entire loaf, so it feeds about six people. I was just travelling with one other person, and over the period of the next couple of days, every time we would come home a little bit sauced we just ate a bit more sandwich. A good deli sandwich is a thing of beauty. What do you do when you can\u2019t get to sleep? I do battle with insomnia from time to time. I\u2019m one of those \u2013 I listen to creepy stories from Reddit being read in a monotone voice. I\u2019ve been listening to Patric Gagne\u2019s book Sociopath: A Memoir, and it is voiced by the author. She ends up getting a doctorate in psychology, specialising in sociopathy, and she\u2019s the most self-aware sociopath I\u2019ve ever heard of. She\u2019s explaining, from the driver\u2019s seat, what it\u2019s like to be her, and what she can feel and what she can\u2019t. It\u2019s very interesting but also helps me go to sleep because the sociopath is out there and in my ears, but not in my house. What\u2019s the oldest thing you own, and why do you still have it? I think with Chinese custom we tend to get rid of stuff, because new means auspicious. So I don\u2019t tend to hold on to a lot; I\u2019m pretty good when I move house. But if I really think about it, it\u2019s probably a bracelet I inherited from my grandmother on my father\u2019s side, which is two dragon heads interlocked. What\u2019s been your most cringeworthy run-in with a celebrity? It\u2019s with Luke McGregor, who has become a friend of mine now! A couple of Logies ago, I was wearing a dress with gloves that extended into sleeves, so there was no gap to take your hand out. Gorgeous, gorgeous gown. He shook my hand, and he\u2019s like: \u201cHow are you going to go to the loo in that dress?\u201d And I didn\u2019t really think about that when I tried it on. Luke is so lovingly awkward, and so am I, which is why we ended up bonding. We workshopped how I was going to go to the loo in this dress, and the answer was not to drink much water or anything at all so I didn\u2019t have to go. In the end, I basically had to take the entire thing off to go and wash my hands, semi-naked, then get dressed again. What book or film do you always return to? I really love watching Ratatouille. It\u2019s just wholesome and lovely and beautiful. And on the other side of the coin, the entire Fast and Furious franchise. Polar opposites, but they\u2019re both really comforting. I just rewatched Tokyo Drift. Don\u2019t ask me how many times I\u2019ve seen it. It\u2019s one of the worst and best movies of all time.

Live on an abattoir in Tasmania for about a year.

Asked if she\u2019ll try to get out now that an Israeli attack seems imminent, Sara says she can\u2019t. \u201cHow can I leave my mum, my family here? They need me. They need me to buy them food.\u201d The Greens immigration spokesperson, David Shoebridge, says the Australian government has \u201cfailed to live up to\u201d its responsibility to Afghans \u201cafter the generation-long invasion of Afghanistan\u201d. \u201cThe Iranian regime is brutal. People from Afghanistan in Iran right now are not safe,\u201d he says, adding that the government should have learned from the situation in Pakistan with deportations and focus on getting people out of Iran. \u201cIt was clear that the regime there would persecute people fleeing from Afghanistan,\u201d he says. \u201cThe government did not act, and now people are in a deeply dangerous situation.\u201d The danger is from both the threat of attack and from the deportations. The Iranian and Pakistani governments are rounding up Afghans and sending them back to the country they fled. A Dfat spokesperson said the government \u201cremains committed to assisting Afghans who supported Australia\u2019s mission in Afghanistan\u201d. \u201cThe government \u2026 is extending all available effort to finalising certifications and visa applications for Afghan LEEs. If a person is certified as an Afghan LEE, the Department of Home Affairs will prioritise the processing of their humanitarian visa application,\u201d the spokesperson said. The home affairs website says the government policy is to also prioritise the immediate families of LEEs. \u201cThere were promises made, very reluctantly, but they were made,\u201d Shabnam Safa, from the Australian Hazara Advocacy Network, says. \u201cAustralia was involved there for 20 years. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but feel that the whole Afghanistan matter has been completely deprioritised.\u201d \u201cWe know people cannot get bread from local bakeries. They can\u2019t get groceries \u2013 there are official signs saying we will not sell anything to Afghan refugees here. Let alone having no access to education, or employment, and constantly living in fear of being deported back to the Taliban.\u201d The Nazar family say they fear deportation and death. \u201cIf you want us to die, we need to know that\u2019s our destiny. Once they find us we will be deported,\u201d Faraz says. \u201cWe\u2019re losing faith that we\u2019re going to be rescued.\u201d *Names have been changed",

Unlike Australia\u2019s many eucalypt species, rainforest trees have not evolved to deal with fire.</p> <p>\u201cIt burns around the base and it cooks the cambium layer \u2013 the live wood \u2013 and the bark. It triggers this slow-motion death and you can see the progressive stages here,\u201d he says, pointing to trees in various stages of that slow death.</p> <p>The fires killed about a third of the mature nightcap oaks, he says, leaving 181 behind. Kooyman\u2019s monitoring shows 72 of those are struggling to survive, or have lost their main stem and now persist \u201cas suckers only\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThat one\u2019s on the way out,\u201d says Kooyman, pointing to a nightcap whose bark and stem is split and is covered by fungi.</p> <p>\u201cThat one is failing too,\u201d says Kooyman, pointing to another. \u201cAnd this was a low-intensity burn.\u201d</p>    <h2>\u2018This is not recovery\u2019</h2> <p>There is smoke in the air from a nearby hazard reduction burn on the day Kooyman takes us to the marked-out plots where he and colleagues are monitoring every post-fire breath, death and revival.</p> <p>Traps made from net and laundry baskets catch and record whatever falls from the canopy; straps called dendrometers measure trunk growth; and then there are recordings of temperature, humidity, light and seed generation, and the state of the soil.</p>    <p>\u201cThey can shrink before they die,\u201d says Kooyman, pointing to one of the dendrometers. \u201cThe theory of negative growth is real \u2013 that would drive the economists crazy,\u201d he laughs.</p> <p>As we leave to look at another patch of burnt rainforest, Kooyman yanks a young wattle that\u2019s sprouting.</p> <p>The fires removed the leaf litter on the forest floor, creating a perfect bed for dormant wattle seeds to germinate.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of years of accumulated leaf fall makes the ground bounce like a mattress underfoot and, high above, rainforest coachwood trees form a dense canopy that dresses the understory in permanent shade. Some of the unique plants in this rainforest can trace their lineage back 40 or 50m years when the Gondwana supercontinent was breaking apart and Australia was detaching itself from what is now Antarctica. Take only a few steps from the cool shade and you emerge to something altogether different. Still rainforest, but changing fast. Soil and rocks are exposed and, above, the leafless branches of tall and dead trees let the sunlight strike the forest floor. This is a place packed with threatened species, including the nightcap oak \u2013 a true Gondwanan relic that grows nowhere else. On the ground and at the base of the thin-barked trees is charcoal. Five years ago, chunks of this rainforest not evolved to burn, did burn, during what became known as Australia\u2019s black summer bushfires. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cIt can take a lot of these trees a long time to die. It is a long, slow death,\u201d says Dr Robert Kooyman, an evolutionary ecologist who has spent more than 40 years working and studying the rainforests in and around Nightcap national park in northern New South Wales. About 73,000 sq km of forest were burned in the east and south of the country during black summer and the fires scorched the habitat of about 3 billion native animals. Half of the world heritage-listed Gondwana rainforests \u2013 a network of 40 parks and reserves \u2013 were affected by the fires that were driven by global heating. Fires burned into about 10% of the rainforest in the Nightcap area and affected about 30% of the rainforest\u2019s margin, says Kooyman. Kooyman discovered the nightcap oak in the late 1980s. Unlike Australia\u2019s many eucalypt species, rainforest trees have not evolved to deal with fire. \u201cIt burns around the base and it cooks the cambium layer \u2013 the live wood \u2013 and the bark. It triggers this slow-motion death and you can see the progressive stages here,\u201d he says, pointing to trees in various stages of that slow death. The fires killed about a third of the mature nightcap oaks, he says, leaving 181 behind. Kooyman\u2019s monitoring shows 72 of those are struggling to survive, or have lost their main stem and now persist \u201cas suckers only\u201d. \u201cThat one\u2019s on the way out,\u201d says Kooyman, pointing to a nightcap whose bark and stem is split and is covered by fungi. \u201cThat one is failing too,\u201d says Kooyman, pointing to another. \u201cAnd this was a low-intensity burn.\u201d \u2018This is not recovery\u2019 There is smoke in the air from a nearby hazard reduction burn on the day Kooyman takes us to the marked-out plots where he and colleagues are monitoring every post-fire breath, death and revival. Traps made from net and laundry baskets catch and record whatever falls from the canopy; straps called dendrometers measure trunk growth; and then there are recordings of temperature, humidity, light and seed generation, and the state of the soil. \u201cThey can shrink before they die,\u201d says Kooyman, pointing to one of the dendrometers. \u201cThe theory of negative growth is real \u2013 that would drive the economists crazy,\u201d he laughs. As we leave to look at another patch of burnt rainforest, Kooyman yanks a young wattle that\u2019s sprouting. The fires removed the leaf litter on the forest floor, creating a perfect bed for dormant wattle seeds to germinate. They have been growing at an incredible density \u2013 as many as 30,000 a hectare (12,100 an acre). \u201cThey\u2019ll create a fire influence inside the rainforest,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we had a dry season and another fire, there are huge amounts of this vegetation that would explode in flames. That\u2019s the problem. You end up with a fire-prone landscape.\u201d The fires here were followed within months by torrential rain and violent floods that blasted the banks of the rock-strewn creeks and swept away weakened trees and plants. Kooyman used to see platypus here but since the fires, there\u2019s no sign. More than once on this day, Kooyman bristles when the word \u201crecovery\u201d comes up. For fire-adapted forests, the word \u201crecovery\u201d might be fair, but not for rainforests, he says. \u201cLet\u2019s not let this terminology overwhelm us.

Do we have them crisped by climate change, or do we start compensating for what we know is happening and protect them?\u201d Measuring decline The fire that hit Nightcap national park and the neighbouring Whian Whian state conservation area started in late October as a lightning strike and gained momentum as the extreme heat and dry of 2019 was joined by winds. Kooyman is an honorary research fellow at Sydney\u2019s Macquarie University, a researcher at the city\u2019s Royal Botanical Gardens and scientist with Missouri Botanical Gardens programs in west Africa and Madagascar. But he lives less than an hour\u2019s drive from Nightcap and got to his beloved rainforest within days as the ground was still smouldering. \u201cI did find myself, not depressed but, maybe like PTSD working in these impact zones. I\u2019m not inclined to any level of depression, but this has had an impact on me.

      "bodyText": "Keir Starmer expressed his full confidence on Saturday in the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, after an explosive cabinet row cast fresh doubt over his Downing Street operation and threatened to overshadow a key international investment summit in London. Government sources said the prime minister and Haigh had spoken and made up on Saturday after Starmer appeared to rebuke her on Friday for branding P&amp;O Ferries a \u201crogue operator\u201d in a statement and then calling for customers to boycott the company in a subsequent media interview. The comments \u2013 and a description by the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, of P&amp;O\u2019s behaviour as \u201coutrageous\u201d when it sacked nearly 800 workers without notice in 2022 \u2013 led to reports that P&amp;O\u2019s parent company, DP World, had pulled out of Monday\u2019s investment summit and shelved a \u00a31bn infrastructure project at the London Gateway. The workers sacked in March 2022 were told of their fate by the company in pre-recorded Zoom video.

The release had been signed off by the No 10 communications team. \u201cNo 10 comms gave it the tick,\u201d said a well-placed source. Both Haigh and Rayner were said by insiders to be \u201chopping mad\u201d that No 10 had not protected them, given that it had sanctioned the same kind of highly critical language towards P&amp;O. Downing Street sources later said that while the row had been smoothed over, it had been Haigh\u2019s comments about a boycott that had gone too far and caused most annoyance to P&amp;O\u2019s owners. On Saturday night, it appeared that DP World would, after all, attend the conference and that the investment of \u00a31bn was no longer under threat. Senior sources confirmed that Haigh and Starmer had spoken on the phone and that he had expressed his confidence in her. The Observer also understands that senior ministers, including Haigh, had not been informed in advance that DP World would be attending the investment summit, nor that they had been proposing a \u00a31bn investment that would be announced at it.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a> on Saturday released<strong> </strong>a report on her health and medical history, which found that \u201cshe possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency\u201d if voters elect her in November.</p> <p>A senior aide to Harris, 59, said the vice-president\u2019s advisers viewed the publication of the health report and medical history as an opportunity to call attention to questions about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>\u2019s physical fitness and mental acuity. The 78-year-old Republican White House nominee would be the oldest president elected if Americans gave him a second term in the Oval Office.</p> <p>Saturday\u2019s report \u2013 in the form of a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/VP-Harris-Health-Summary.pdf\">two-page letter</a> from the vice-president\u2019s physician, Joshua Simmons \u2013 described Harris as being in \u201cexcellent health\u201d and asserted that her medical history was notable for seasonal allergies and hives. Harris manages those conditions with over-the-counter medications such as Allegra, Atrovent nasal spray and Pataday eye drops, and she has been on allergen immunotherapy for three years, the letter said.</p> <p>Otherwise, Harris is mildly nearsighted and wears corrective contact lenses as a result, had abdominal surgery when she was three years old and has a maternal history of colon cancer. \u201cShe has no personal history of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cardiac disease, pulmonary disease, neurological disorders, cancer or osteoporosis,\u201d said the letter from Simmons, who added that the vice-president\u2019s most recent physical examination in April was \u201cunremarkable\u201d.</p> <p>The statement on Harris\u2019s health came on Saturday as Trump has become<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/06/trump-behavior-final-meltdown\">increasingly incoherent</a> at campaign rallies, something the Guardian US reported on earlier in October. He has been slurring, stumbling over his words, hurling expletives \u2013 and showing signs of cognitive decline consistent with someone approaching his 80s, according to medical experts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/11/kamala-harris-vogue-cover\">Kamala Harris lands second Vogue cover: \u2018The candidate for our times\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recent speeches have seen him rant about topics ranging from his purportedly \u201cbeautiful\u201d body to \u201ca million Rambos\u201d in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Harris campaign aides pointed to Trump\u2019s backing out of an interview with CBS\u2019s 60 Minutes that the vice-president granted and his refusal to debate her again after their 10 September face-off. They argue that the former president is \u201cavoiding public scrutiny\u201d and giving voters \u201cthe impression \u2026 that he has something to hide and may not be up for the job\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cContrast her age and vitality with his,\u201d the senior aide to Harris, 59, said early on Saturday.</p> <p>Trump has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/health/trump-health-records.html\">repeatedly declined to release detailed information about his health</a> during his public life.

      "bodyText": "Kamala Harris on Saturday released a report on her health and medical history, which found that \u201cshe possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency\u201d if voters elect her in November. A senior aide to Harris, 59, said the vice-president\u2019s advisers viewed the publication of the health report and medical history as an opportunity to call attention to questions about Donald Trump\u2019s physical fitness and mental acuity. The 78-year-old Republican White House nominee would be the oldest president elected if Americans gave him a second term in the Oval Office. Saturday\u2019s report \u2013 in the form of a two-page letter from the vice-president\u2019s physician, Joshua Simmons \u2013 described Harris as being in \u201cexcellent health\u201d and asserted that her medical history was notable for seasonal allergies and hives. Harris manages those conditions with over-the-counter medications such as Allegra, Atrovent nasal spray and Pataday eye drops, and she has been on allergen immunotherapy for three years, the letter said. Otherwise, Harris is mildly nearsighted and wears corrective contact lenses as a result, had abdominal surgery when she was three years old and has a maternal history of colon cancer. \u201cShe has no personal history of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cardiac disease, pulmonary disease, neurological disorders, cancer or osteoporosis,\u201d said the letter from Simmons, who added that the vice-president\u2019s most recent physical examination in April was \u201cunremarkable\u201d. The statement on Harris\u2019s health came on Saturday as Trump has become increasingly incoherent at campaign rallies, something the Guardian US reported on earlier in October. He has been slurring, stumbling over his words, hurling expletives \u2013 and showing signs of cognitive decline consistent with someone approaching his 80s, according to medical experts. Recent speeches have seen him rant about topics ranging from his purportedly \u201cbeautiful\u201d body to \u201ca million Rambos\u201d in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Harris campaign aides pointed to Trump\u2019s backing out of an interview with CBS\u2019s 60 Minutes that the vice-president granted and his refusal to debate her again after their 10 September face-off. They argue that the former president is \u201cavoiding public scrutiny\u201d and giving voters \u201cthe impression \u2026 that he has something to hide and may not be up for the job\u201d. \u201cContrast her age and vitality with his,\u201d the senior aide to Harris, 59, said early on Saturday. Trump has repeatedly declined to release detailed information about his health during his public life. For instance, before winning the White House in 2016, he only offered a four-paragraph letter from his personal doctor that bragged that Trump would be \u201cthe healthiest person ever elected to the presidency\u201d, as the New York Times recently reported. Trump\u2019s first physical as president resulted in perhaps the most detailed overview of his health to date. According to the Times, the physical flagged \u201cworryingly high\u201d cholesterol and a body mass index that left him 0.1 points below the threshold for medical obesity. Nonetheless, in a statement on Saturday, a Trump campaign spokesperson claimed the former president regularly distributed medical updates and that all \u201chave concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be commander in chief\u201d. \u201cIt is said [Harris] does not have the stamina of \u2026 Trump,\u201d the campaign spokesperson\u2019s statement also said. Questions over whether Joe Biden was too enfeebled forced him to halt his bid for re-election to the presidency during the summer. The 81-year-old Democrat dropped out of a rematch with Trump on 21 July and endorsed Harris to succeed him. Recent national polling averages show Harris with a two-point edge over Trump in the 5 November race for the presidency. But key swing states remain too close to call, and most experts expect a competitive election. The Republican party chose Trump as their nominee despite his being convicted in May of criminally falsifying business records to cover up hush-money payments to an adult film actor who claimed an extramarital sexual encounter with him about a decade before his successful run for the presidency in 2016. Among other legal problems, he is grappling with criminal charges that he tried to illicitly overturn his defeat to Biden in the 2020 election. Trump, for his part, has maintained that Biden \u201cbecame mentally impaired\u201d. He also said that Harris \u201cwas born that way\u201d while struggling to pronounce the vice-president\u2019s name. At a town hall in Las Vegas for a group of undecided voters on Thursday, Harris said \u201cusing language that\u2019s belittling \u2026 [is not] healthy for our nation\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t admire that,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd in fact, I\u2019m quite critical of it coming from someone who wants to be president of the United States.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ewan Murray was at Stadion Maksimir, and his report is below. Thanks for reading this MBM, with its last word going to James Humphries: \u201cTo be fair, it looked offside to me on the replay too. Watching the game with my daughter though, and as soon as the replay came up I slumped back going \u2018ah well, that\u2019s us then\u2019 while she was defiantly insisting it was definitely gonna stand. Innocence and experience, eh?\u201d Adams was clearly off, to be fair, if the VAR slide flashed up is anything to go by. But nevertheless, in summary: sigh. Scotland are still looking for their first point in Group A1, after a third game in which they\u2019ve matched superior opponents for the most part, only to be eventually overwhelmed and delivered a sickening late blow. Pure tincture of Scotland, right there, times three. But at least we don\u2019t have to suffer an hour-long post-mortem about it. Thank you, YouTube! Portugal P2 W2 D0 L0 F4 A2 Pts 6 Croatia P3 W2 D0 L1 F4 A3 Pts 6 Poland P2 W1 D0 L1 F3 A3 Pts 3 Scotland P3 W0 D0 L3 F3 A5 Pts 0 That\u2019s the final act as the whistle goes. Yet another last-gasp sickener for Scotland. 90 min +7: Adams was just off. The goal\u2019s ruled out. 90 min +6: \u2026 but VAR is going to take a look. Was Adams offside when McLean backheeled? The clock ticks past the extra four minutes \u2026 but the whistle doesn\u2019t go, and Scotland have one last go. The ball\u2019s shuttled into the Croatian box. Some pinball. McLean backheels down the inside-left channel. Adams lunges to shoot. Jaki\u0107 extends a leg and gets there first, only to divert the ball, which bobbles across Livakovi\u0107 and into the bottom right! 90 min +3: Baturina goes charging down the right, only to be cynically taken out by a frustrated Gilmour. Into the book he goes. 90 min +2: McTominay charges down the right but once again the cross is lacking. A frustrating night in the final third for Scotland. 90 min +1: The first of four additional minutes sees Peri\u0161i\u0107 make way for Kristijan Jaki\u0107. 90 min: Scotland are pushing forward, but the final ball is lacking. But then Gauld, his back to goal 25 yards out, plays a sensational reverse pass down the left channel. Adams meets the bouncing ball but his loop over the keeper drifts wide right of goal. So close to a sensational equaliser! Scotland have had their chances. Their half-chances, at least. 88 min: Gauld teases in a dangerous cross from the left, having been sent into space by that man Gilmour. \u0106aleta-Car extends a leg to hook clear just in time. Scotland come again, though, McTominay bustling down the inside-left channel before scooping a diagonal shot wide and high. Then the flag pops up for offside. 86 min: Gilmour continues to battle, intercept and probe. He\u2019s been magnificent between both boxes tonight. Scotland\u2019s star man. 84 min: Gilmour drops deep and tries to release Gauld down the inside-left channel. It\u2019s a decent idea, well executed, but there are two defenders making a pincer movement on Gauld, who has no chance of bursting clear. 82 min: The pace has dropped, which suits Croatia just fine, because the clock continues to count down at the same lick. 80 min: It\u2019s a new Su\u010di\u0107 on the pitch now. Petar advances down the right and sends what could have been a cross but might also have been a shot wide left. 79 min: \u2026 although having said all that, Christie was probably offside. At least that\u2019s what the replay looks like to the naked eye. Had that ended up in the Croatian net, the VAR would have had to get their ruler out. 78 min: Scotland should be level. Christie is sent racing clear down the inside-right channel by McTominay\u2019s clever pass. He\u2019s one on one with the keeper, and has Adams and Gauld in the middle, waiting to tap home \u2026 but gets caught between two ideas, eventually scuffing a shot-cum-cross harmlessly wide left, his team-mates given no chance to reach the ball. What a waste! 77 min: Scotland make their first changes, replacing Dykes and Doak with Ch\u00e9 Adams and Ryan Gauld. 76 min: As the corner floats over the box, Gvardiol skittles McLean and the pressure is released. 75 min: Scotland suddenly look so ragged. Baturina dances his way down the right and wins a corner. Modri\u0107 to take. 74 min: \u2026 so anyway, that half-time mention of Laurel &amp; Hardy has led Scott Blair to send in a clipping from Aberdeen\u2019s Press &amp; Journal. 72 min: That\u2019s Kramari\u0107\u2019s last act of the evening, so what a way to bow out. He\u2019s replaced by Bruno Petkovi\u0107, while Matanovi\u0107 makes way for Ante Budimir. Yep, this had been coming. A deep cross into the Scotland box from the right. Sosa meets it with a screaming volley. Gordon manages to make a save, but the ball balloons up to Kramari\u0107, who heads home from a couple of yards. 68 min: Croatia are pushing Scotland back now. The visitors holding their shape for now. 66 min: Baturina \u2026 well \u2026 batters a long-distance shot over the bar. Scotland are suddenly beginning to ship half-chances with unwanted regularity. 65 min: Modri\u0107 sashays his way down the inside-left channel, nutmegging McTominay along the way, before skelping a rising drive across Gordon and inches wide of the right-hand post. What a goal that would have been! 64 min: Doak goes rampaging into space down the right, and feeds McTominay on the overlap. McTominay makes it into the box, but his attempted cross is dismal. Doak reclaims possession, but he gets overly cute as well, and Croatia clear their lines. In the middle, Dykes can be forgiven for breaking into a full, no-nonsense fume. 62 min: Croatia make another chance, replacing Luka Su\u010di\u0107 with the 21-year-old midfielder Martin Baturina, reportedly their great new hope. 61 min: Robertson crosses from the left. Dykes cushions a header down for McTominay, but for once Scotland\u2019s goal machine can\u2019t sort his feet out and get a shot away. Croatia clear their lines. Both teams look in the mood to search out a winner. 60 min: Matanovi\u0107 is thankfully fine to continue. 59 min: Peri\u0161i\u0107 crosses from the right. Gordon comes off his line to punch clear, and accidentally knees the lurking Matanovi\u0107 in the back. The crowd continue to whistle with annoyance, but it was all purely accidental. On comes the physio. 58 min: Robertson\u2019s corner is half cleared. Ralston sends it back towards Robertson on the right. Robertson flicks a cross with the outside of his boot. Souttar flaps a weak header wide left. Scotland reasonably close to delivering the ultimate sucker punch after Croatia\u2019s disallowed goal! 57 min: Scotland go up the other end through Doak, who wins a corner down the right. Robertson to take. 56 min: \u2026 Su\u010di\u0107 whistles an unstoppable drive into the bottom right from 25 yards! But when the ball was being worked out to him, the flag had popped up for offside. Croatia not happy, but this is the way it is. 55 min: Modri\u0107 has been quiet. So now he digs out an improvised snapshot that heads towards the top left. Gordon makes another fine save. The ball drops near Kramari\u0107 and is whacked out for a corner. From which \u2026 54 min: Ralston has his critics for his defensive ability all right, but he can cause a problem or two going forward. He combines well with Doak down the right but can\u2019t find McTominay with his cutback. 53 min: Matanovi\u0107 latches onto a loose pass, 35 yards out, and nearly takes full advantage by larruping a low drive towards the bottom right. Gordon extends fully to palm the ball away from the corner. It was heading in. 51 min: Gilmour is winning a lot of loose ball in the middle of the park. Dykes is putting himself around as well. \u0160utalo comes off second best in a duel with the big striker, who is awarded a free kick as well. Croatia and their fans a little bit frustrated right now. 49 min: Robertson teases a cross in from the left but the ball evades Dykes. The striker claims a corner kick, but Scotland aren\u2019t getting one. 47 min: All a bit shapeless in the opening exchanges of the second half. \u201cScotland are unrecognisable from the team that played in the Euros, and I don\u2019t mean because they play in a hue of blue so almost that it\u2019s white,\u201d writes K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cThis is especially impressive, considering the long list of absentees.\u201d \u2026 and we\u2019re back! Sound on! Vision on! Croatia get the second half underway. Petar Su\u010di\u0107 has replaced Mario Pa\u0161ali\u0107. Half-time postbag. \u201cIf you\u2019d have told me 20 years ago that I\u2019d be sat in front of an iPad watching Scotland play Croatia in the Uefa Nations League on YouTube, while also following a live minute-by-minute commentary via the Guardian website, I\u2019d probably have choked on my fag and can of McEwans Export. Now I only drink craft beer and cocktails, and vape, but I still nearly choked when Scotland took the lead\u201d \u2013 Simon McMahon Tell you what, Viaplay, the SFA, Uefa, STV, BBC Scotland, Uncle Tom Cobley and all have taken some flak for this game being YouTube only, but I\u2019m coming round to it quicksmart. The feed clicked on ten minutes before kick-off, there was no bloviating for an hour beforehand, we\u2019re currently enjoying some peaceful silence at half-time, and I\u2019m pretty sure the switch will be flicked off the minute the final whistle goes. I\u2019m all for this. Broadcasters please take note! If you really need to fill the gaps on your channel before and after, show a couple of cartoons or some Laurel &amp; Hardy. Half-time entertainment. A play in three emails, by James Humphries. 32 min: \u201cScotland looking pretty decent with the ball here, young Doak in particular. Defensive howler in the post for definite then; my bet is just before half-time.\u201d 34 min: \u201cI mean, I thought it would be a Scottish defensive howler, but I\u2019ll take it.\u201d 37 min: \u201cI don\u2019t know why I say these things. Ah, never mind. There\u2019s that old familiar feeling.\u201d Nothing happens in it. Croatia haven\u2019t played badly; Scotland have played well. 45 min: There will be one additional minute. 44 min: A cute flick from Gilmour sends Scotland on the attack. Doak\u2019s cross from the right evades Dykes. Scotland continue to go forward without fear. 43 min: The tempo drops a bit, both teams perhaps dreaming of their half-time cuppa. 41 min: Robertson, having just forced a corner, has to concede one at the other end under pressure from Peri\u0161i\u0107. Susa takes it short, Croatia over-elaborate, and eventually the flag goes up for offside. 40 min: Robertson hoicks a diagonal free kick towards the far stick, forcing Pa\u0161ali\u0107 to turn the ball behind for a corner with McTominay lurking. Sadly nothing comes of the resulting set piece, but this is a decent response from Scotland to the disappointment of giving up their lead so quickly. 39 min: McLean makes good down the inside-left channel and is cynically hauled back by Peri\u0161i\u0107, who goes into the book. A free kick just outside the box, on its left-hand edge. 38 min: Doak continues to make a nuisance of himself down the right. He looks a proper player. Good news for Middlesbrough and Liverpool, but especially Scotland, who really need someone who can provide that extra sparkle. Well that didn\u2019t last long. Matanovi\u0107 scores his first goal for his country. A long ball down the right. Peri\u0161i\u0107 cuts it back first time, and the in-rushing Matanovi\u0107 whips a low drive into the bottom left from the edge of the box. 35 min: Uefa have decided that\u2019s an own goal by \u0106aleta-Car. Nah. Had the defender not attempted his clearance, Christie\u2019s shot was going in anyway. McTominay feeds Doak down the right. Doak dribbles purposefully infield and dinks a cross into the middle. Su\u010di\u0107, his back to goal, slices a dreadful clearance backwards. The ball drops to Christie, on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. Christie swivels and shoots. \u0106aleta-Car, on his own line, can only help the ball into his own net. Scotland lead! And it\u2019s not undeserved! 31 min: Kramari\u0107 cuts in from the left but his rising shot is parried confidently by Gordon. Peri\u0161i\u0107 then crosses from the other flank, Sosa heading wide left. Better from Croatia, who have suddenly moved up a gear. 30 min: McLean nearly releases Doak down the middle, but the winger can\u2019t combine with Dykes and the hosts clear their lines. The Tartan Army cry foul, but the referee isn\u2019t interested. 28 min: Scotland look comfortable enough right now. Croatia perhaps mindful of Robert Snodgrass\u2019s winner 11 years ago? 26 min: Su\u010di\u0107 crosses deep from the right. At the far stick, Sosa prepares to head goalwards from six yards, but Ralston gets in the way. A brave header that doesn\u2019t even come at the cost of a corner, because Sosa is penalised for getting too heavy. 24 min: Christie whips a cross in from the left. Dykes is this close to meeting it with his head, six yards out. Gvardiol eased the striker away from the ball there, a gentle lean from behind. 23 min: Kramari\u0107 has another try from the edge of the D. This time he gets a shot away, but Souttar blocks bravely. Scotland still boast the only shot on target, the aforementioned Gilmour lash. 22 min: Modri\u0107 jinks his way down the right and gets the better of Robertson, but his dinked cross is headed away firmly by Hanley. Kramari\u0107 tries to make space to shoot, buy Dykes gets back to take the ball off his toe. Staunch defence. 21 min: Gilmour has a dig from 25 yards. His shot moves around in the air, but unfortunately for Scotland, in the general direction of Livakovi\u0107, who claims easily. 20 min: Some admin: the freshly booked Mario Pa\u0161ali\u0107 will henceforth be known simply as Pa\u0161ali\u0107, unless his namesake Marco comes off the bench, in which case everything changes. 18 min: Doak brings the ball out of defence with confidence, and is scythed down by Mario Pa\u0161ali\u0107, who hangs out a leg and sends the young man high into the air. The Croatian goes into the book. 17 min: Scotland are beginning to settle in this game. They put a few passes together. They go nowhere in particular, but that\u2019s not really the point, and the away fans continue to give it laldie. 15 min: The Croatian keeper Livakovi\u0107 shanks a simple clearance high into the air, and is extremely fortunate neither Dykes nor McTominay are able to bring it down on the edge of the box and shoot. A shame for Scotland that the shank didn\u2019t drop more kindly. 14 min: Robertson goes on another power run down the left but there\u2019s nobody free in the middle. He\u2019s forced to put the brakes on. A couple of promising breaks by the Scotland captain already. 13 min: It\u2019s been a fairly lively start, and so the match settles down a little. \u201cIn a surprising development, this match is actually being shown on Fox\u2019s main sports channel here in the States. If I had to give a one word description for Scotland\u2019s kit, I\u2019d go with \u2018white\u2019. Beyond that, I\u2019d say the trim and numbers are periwinkle?\u201d Joe Pearson there, publicly pitching for a job in the Adidas marketing department. 11 min: Doak steals a ball in midfield and goes tearing off down the right. He cuts back looking for Christie, but Modri\u0107 has read the danger and gets back to intercept. 10 min: Robertson has a dig from the best part of 35 yards. Full marks for ambition, and he nearly gets a bonus point by taking out the right-hand corner flag. 9 min: Modri\u0107 shapes to shoot, but Su\u010di\u0107 has a go instead, blootering a witless effort straight into the wall. It clips off a blue shirt and out for a goal kick. Modri\u0107 will take the next one, you can bet large on that. 8 min: Matanovi\u0107 advances down the inside-right channel. He\u2019s crudely brought to ground by Hanley, who is booked for his trouble. A free kick just to the right of the D. Modri\u0107\u2019s eyes light up. 7 min: This is better from Scotland. Robertson tears down the left touchline. His low cross is only hacked half-clear by Gvardiol, and the ball\u2019s returned instantly by Christie, whose drive whistles inches wide of the left-hand post. 6 min: Scotland can\u2019t keep hold of the ball at all. Dykes tries to get hold of it but only manages to skittle \u0106aleta-Car. 4 min: Sosa crosses from the left. The ball breaks to Kramari\u0107 on the edge of the Scotland D. He doesn\u2019t catch his shot well. The ball pings off Robertson and away from danger. A strong start by the hosts, though. 3 min: Pa\u0161ali\u0107 is seeing a lot of the ball early doors. He feeds Peri\u0161i\u0107 three times in a row, in short order, though the Croatian winger can\u2019t fashion a decent cross. Gordon claims the third. 2 min: Croatia stroke it around to establish whose home this is. Scotland kick off. There\u2019s not much of an atmosphere in the Stadion Maksimir, with one of the main stands out of commission. But the away fans are doing their best. The teams are out! Croatia are playing in their second-choice dark blue kit today \u2026 still with a check pattern, naturally \u2026 while Scotland wear their [squints, tilts documents towards light, moves glasses down nose, double-takes] Almost Blue (i.e. not blue) change strip. We\u2019ll be off in a couple of minutes! Steve Clarke speaks to BBC Radio Scotland. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve had a win, so it\u2019d be nice to get one here \u2026 obviously a difficult match but one we look forward to \u2026 if we didn\u2019t think we could compete we would have stayed at home \u2026 we compete for a win or at least a point on the board \u2026 the injuries are there for everyone to see \u2026 there is no point harping on about it \u2026 I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve gone backwards.\u201d Croatia aren\u2019t on the best of runs. That aforementioned win over Poland was their first in five matches, before which draws at home with Italy and Albania were sandwiched by defeats to Spain and Portugal. However that\u2019s all wine and roses compared to the miserable run Scotland are on. Steve Clarke\u2019s side have won just one of their last 14 matches, and that an extremely unconvincing 2-0 win in Gibraltar. Nine of the other 13 games have been lost, several comprehensively so: 1-3 v England, 1-4 v France, 0-4 v Netherlands, 1-5 v Germany. The 0-1 loss to Northern Ireland wasn\u2019t much better, though to be fair a 0-2 defeat in Spain might have turned out rather differently had Scott McTominay not had an opening goal chalked off for bugger all. Also, the Scots remain the last team to beat the new European champions in a competitive fixture, so yes sir, on a good day they can indeed boogie. Weird that before the team embarked on this sorry run, they\u2019d won eight of their previous ten. That\u2019s the Scottish national team distilled into the purest tincture. Croatia make three changes to the side that won 1-0 against Poland last time round. Mario Pa\u0161ali\u0107, Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107 and Andrej Kramari\u0107 \u2013 the latter two World Cup finalists \u2013 replace Marko Pjaca and Bruno Petkovi\u0107, who drop to the bench, and Mateo Kova\u010di\u0107, absent with baby on the way. Luka Modri\u0107, the third member of that famous 2018 side starting today, will win his 181st cap. Here\u2019s the story of Scotland\u2019s Nations League campaign so far. It\u2019s been A1 in name, if nothing else. Injury-time misery \u2026 \u2026 was soon compounded by more late woe \u2026 \u2026 and so the Group A1 table currently looks like this. Poland will host Portugal later this evening. Portugal P2 W2 D0 L0 F4 A2 Pts 6 Croatia P2 W1 D0 L1 F2 A2 Pts 3 Poland P2 W1 D0 L1 F3 A3 Pts 3 Scotland P2 W0 D0 L2 F3 A5 Pts 0 Scotland make three changes to the team that started the 2-1 defeat in Portugal. Craig Gordon replaces Angus Gunn in goal, John Souttar steps in for Scott McKenna at the back, and the creative void left by the absence of John McGinn is filled by Ben Doak, making his first full start for his country. Ch\u00e9 Adams, who has scored three goals in Serie A for Torino this season, has to make do with a place on the bench; Steve Clarke sticks with Lyndon Dykes, who has yet to score his first goal for Birmingham City in League One. Croatia: Livakovi\u0107, \u0160utalo, \u0106aleta-Car, Gvardiol, Peri\u0161i\u0107, Modri\u0107, Mario Pa\u0161ali\u0107, Sosa, L Su\u010di\u0107, Matanovi\u0107, Kramari\u0107. Subs: Labrovi\u0107, Ivu\u0161i\u0107, Jaki\u0107, Erli\u0107, Moro, Marco Pa\u0161ali\u0107, Budimir, P Su\u010di\u0107, Baturina, Petkovi\u0107, Or\u0161i\u0107, Pjaca. Scotland: Gordon, Ralston, Hanley, Souttar, Robertson, Gilmour, McLean, Christie, McTominay, Doak, Dykes. Subs: McCracken, McCrorie, Adams, MacKenzie, Irving, Porteous, Lindsay, Morgan, Nisbet, Gauld, Devlin. Referee: Istv\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs (Romania). Scotland are without James Forrest, Angus Gunn, Kieran Tierney, John McGinn, Scott McKenna, Jack Henry, Tommy Conway, Aaron Hickey, Nathan Patterson and Lewis Ferguson for their visit to Zagreb: no wonder STV and BBC Scotland have decided to give this fixture the bodyswerve. Time was, the BBC would clear the decks for the Old Firm and Edinburgh derbies and still find room for the Young Pigeon National pigeon racing. Just six-and-half hours from Cheltenham to Ecclefechan, and that despite the birds being released into a headwind! But now it\u2019s Alan Carr\u2019s Picture Slam this, Viaplay International YouTube channel that, and here we are. Thank the lord for the Guardian MBM, eh readers? What? Oh. OK, but we are doing this nevertheless. Kick-off is at 5pm BST. It\u2019s not on \u2026 but it\u2019s on!",

      "body": "<p>This may sting Steve Clarke more than Scotland\u2019s humbling at the hands of Germany to open Euro 2024. Events in Zagreb might hurt the Scotland manager more than the insipid loss to Hungary that ended involvement in the same competition.</p> <p>With the Scots so desperately in need of hope, they believed they had snatched a 95th-minute \u00adequaliser in the Croatian capital.

Enter the video \u00adassistant referee, who determined Ch\u00e9 Adams was offside before his shot flicked off Kristijan Jakic and into the net. It was the final act of the game and the latest dent to Clarke\u2019s morale. The extending of a run to one win in 15 would have been gleefully accepted had Adams\u2019s intervention stood. Scotland arguably deserved a draw. All of this felt irrelevant as the bones of another defeat were being picked through.

      "bodyText": "This may sting Steve Clarke more than Scotland\u2019s humbling at the hands of Germany to open Euro 2024. Events in Zagreb might hurt the Scotland manager more than the insipid loss to Hungary that ended involvement in the same competition. With the Scots so desperately in need of hope, they believed they had snatched a 95th-minute equaliser in the Croatian capital. Clarke celebrated in a manner far from typical for a man of his stoicism. Enter the video assistant referee, who determined Ch\u00e9 Adams was offside before his shot flicked off Kristijan Jakic and into the net. It was the final act of the game and the latest dent to Clarke\u2019s morale. The extending of a run to one win in 15 would have been gleefully accepted had Adams\u2019s intervention stood. Scotland arguably deserved a draw. All of this felt irrelevant as the bones of another defeat were being picked through. They remain without a point in Group A1 and winless in nine competitive outings. \u201cYou get the high when you think you have a deserved draw then it is taken away from you,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cThe performance was really good. We have to believe we are on the right path. At some stage we will get the rub of the green, we will get a break and things will change.\u201d If poor form was the overriding concern, illness had also beset the Scotland camp in the build-up to this game. Clarke could have done without that; he was already missing a dozen players because of injuries. Through crisis comes opportunity. Ben Doak, the Liverpool teenager currently on loan at Middlesbrough, was handed a first Scotland start here.

Trump\u2019s statement that the Federal Communications Commission should \u201ctake away\u201d CBS\u2019s broadcast license betrays his ignorance of the fact that the FCC does not license networks and foreshadows a full-on assault on free speech and freedom of the press if he becomes president.

The jury reached the uniquely Scottish verdict of \u201cnot proven\u201d on one charge of sexual assault with intent to rape. Another charge was dropped. The subsequent Holyrood inquiry into the Scottish government\u2019s handling of the initial harassment complaints led to huge splits within the SNP, with some senior figures backing Salmond, and accusations that he had been the victim of a witch-hunt within the party. He went on to form the Alba party in 2021, which challenged the SNP on its failure to deliver a second referendum but failed to make electoral headway. Salmond was rumoured to be considering a return to frontline politics at Holyrood at the next Scottish parliament elections in 2026, with speculation that he might stand for the regional list in the north-east of Scotland. Reflecting recently on the referendum result, Salmond said he had started to write his concession speech after the first result was declared on the night of the vote. The yes campaign lost the vote, 45% to 55%. The first result came from Clackmannanshire, often seen as reflecting national sentiment. Voters there backed staying within the UK by 53.8% to 46.2%. \u201cWhen I saw that result, I started to write my concession speech,\u201d Salmond said. \u201cNobody gave us a chance at the start. I always reckoned if we got to the positive side of the argument, if we claimed the positive side for \u2018yes\u2019, which in itself is an affirmation, then once we got into the campaign, I thought we\u2019d pick up ground, and so we did.\u201d",

On Saturday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) renewed its evacuation orders for Palestinians still living in the decimated northern half of Gaza, although many residents say the fighting and Israeli sniper fire make it impossible to leave. Avichay Adraee, an IDF spokesperson, told people that the area includes parts of Gaza City\u2019s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood and sections around Jabalia, the urban refugee camp. In a social media post, Adraee asked people living there to head south to al-Mawasi, a coastal area of southern Gaza where hundreds of thousands of people are already displaced. A total of 84% of the territory is currently under evacuation orders, pushing civilians into ever-dwindling \u201chumanitarian zones\u201d which Israel has bombed regardless. The UN says an estimated 400,000 people are trapped by the latest ground fighting and artillery fire centred in Jabalia, which has now entered a second week. \u201cIt is getting tougher every day.

It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the fire. Israel stepped up its campaign against the Lebanese militia Hezbollah last month after a year of tit-for-tat fire triggered by Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack and the ensuing war in Gaza. The new war in Lebanon has heightened the risk of a region-wide escalation drawing in Iran and the US. Ceasefire talks on ending the fighting in Gaza have been stalled since July.",

It also highlights Jenrick stating he would vote for Donald Trump if he were in the US, a decision as housing minister that helped a Tory donor avoid a tax bill, and his order to paint over cartoon murals in a child asylum-seeker unit. Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem deputy leader, said she believed the Tories risked \u201cconfining themselves to the political wilderness\u201d by a move to the right under their new leader. \u201cIt\u2019s completely chaotic,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we see how they\u2019re operating behind the scenes, they\u2019re just as chaotic in opposition as they were in government. The results of the leadership ballot just reinforce that really is the case. \u201cIn many cases, there are lifelong Conservative voters who maybe consider themselves one nation Conservatives who look at our values of internationalism, environmentalism, and being pro-business and pro-public sector, who now identify more closely with us. If they carry on like this, it looks like the Conservative party has effectively given up on the blue wall.\u201d Tory members now have the final say over who will replace Rishi Sunak as leader. They have until the end of the month to cast their vote online. In the last vote of members in 2022, when they chose Liz Truss over Sunak, about 140,000 votes were cast. While polls have suggested Badenoch is most popular among members, the contest is impossible to call.",

Palace officials have blamed the pandemic, the change of reign, and then planning for last year\u2019s coronation for their inability to publish details of the gifts received by members of the royal family. The royal family\u2019s reticence follows controversy over a cash-for-honours scandal involving the king\u2019s main charitable foundation, which led to a police investigation that was dropped last year without a full explanation from either Scotland Yard or the Crown Prosecution Service. It also comes after revelations that Charles, when he was Prince of Wales, accepted \u00a32.6m in cash in bags from a Qatari politician for another of his charities, the Prince of Wales\u2019s Charitable Fund. The Duke of York also faced allegations that when he was a working royal he used official overseas trips to conduct private business deals. But unlike MPs, who have to register gifts, donations and hospitality, there is no public register of interests for members of the royal family. Instead, they act on the advice of their private secretaries in deciding what to declare. Annual gift lists were introduced after media criticism of attempts by the royal household to conceal the origin of lavish jewellery given to Queen Camilla by a Saudi royal in 2006 and worn by her on an official visit to the US in 2007. The last annual list, detailing official gifts received by all working members of the royal family in 2019, was published in April 2020 but since then there has been nothing, apart from the occasional description of an exchange of presents during a state visit or pictures when they are given gifts during an engagement. Over the years, the annual list has led to controversy, such as in 2012 when it emerged that the king of Bahrain and his country\u2019s prime minister had given a \u201csuite of jewels\u201d to Prince Edward\u2019s wife, Sophie, while facing criticism over human rights abuses. But many presents, including sensitive ones, were often concealed, even though official gifts are not the personal property of the royals and are in effect accepted on behalf of the nation. Saudi Arabia\u2019s controversial crown prince Mohammed bin Salman gave the Duchess of Sussex a \u00a3500,000 pair of diamond chandelier earrings as a wedding present in 2018.

An exhaustive list of gifts to the couple was published and more than 2,500 items went on show to the public. Charles ordered a formal review of the royal household\u2019s policy on official gifts in 2003, after a scandal over staff selling unwanted presents. It resulted in clearer definitions as to what constitutes an official gift and a personal present. Official gifts are those received in connection with official duties or from businesses or individuals not personally known to the family member. They include gifts from dignitaries, such as other heads of state or elected representatives, during events and are not the family members\u2019 private property. Personal gifts are those from people they know privately with no connection to official duties. Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic, which campaigns for an elected head of state to replace the monarch, said: \u201cIt is vital that the public knows about any possible conflicts of interest or attempts to curry favour with royals, as they have direct access to the highest levels of government.\u201d He added: \u201cCharles and senior royals have access to government papers, can have secretive meetings with ministers and the prime minister and they have leverage to pressure government to do favours for them and their friends. \u201cThe royals have form when it comes to blurring the lines between what\u2019s theirs to keep and what\u2019s an official gift. So full disclosure is needed on what\u2019s been received and where those gifts are now. If we demand high standards from politicians, we must demand those same standards from the royals.\u201d A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace said: \u201cThe royal gifts lists will be published in due course.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Zoe Thorogood was walking back to her flat in Bradford last month when she got the call. For two days she had been trying to track down her younger brother, but with no luck.</p> <p>The 26-year-old graphic novelist had sent James \u201csome funny reels on Instagram, and they were ignored\u201d. This wasn\u2019t unusual \u2013 sometimes he would take days to get back to her.</p> <p>\u201cBut it was when his girlfriend messaged me saying that James hadn\u2019t seen her message in 10 hours that I phoned him. His phone was off. I then phoned mum and it all exploded from there.\u201d</p> <p>Nobody knew where James was. His absence was reported to the police, which Thorogood calls a \u201chideously infuriating experience\u201d, leading her to try to track him down through friends and online contacts.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s when I started to panic because they also claimed to know nothing,\u201d she says. \u201cI walked home and as I was around 50 metres from my flat, my dad phoned. He was \u00adcrying. Dad doesn\u2019t cry. I knew what that meant. He just told me to come home, and nothing more. I&nbsp;just&nbsp;remember falling on to the floor&nbsp;screaming in the street.\u201d</p>    <p>James had taken his own life. And once the dust had begun to settle from the bomb that had been thrown under the family, Thorogood decided she had to do something to help other&nbsp;families like them, and perhaps stop what happened to James, \u201cnow eternally 23\u201d, happening to others.</p> <p>Thorogood has a platform and a following, as one of Britain\u2019s top young graphic novelists. Last year, at the famous San Diego comic convention, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/16/the-real-deal-young-graphic-artist-zoe-thorogood-nominated-for-five-eisners\">she was nominated for five Eisner awards</a>, the comics industry\u2019s Oscars, almost unprecedented for such a young creator.</p> <p>She debuted as a graphic novelist in 2020 with <em>The Impending Blindness of Billie Scott</em>, published by Avery Hill and based on her own experiences of when it was feared she might lose her sight as a child, and her major breakthrough work was <em>It\u2019s Lonely at the Centre of the Earth</em>, an autobiographical tale of her own battles with depression and mental ill health, which brought her international attention.</p> <p>Her work, she says, \u201cfeels worthless right now. I\u2019ve had people claim that my work may have \u2018saved their lives\u2019, yet, I couldn\u2019t even \u2018save\u2019 my own brother. I think being a \u2018mental health artist\u2019, or whatever you want to call me, and going through this feels like a giant hand coming out of the clouds and pointing at me and laughing. I know this feeling is temporary, but right now, I hate art.\u201d</p>    <p>But in the wake of James\u2019s death she announced that all profits from <em>It\u2019s Lonely at the Centre of The Earth,</em> which was published by US comics giant Image, will be donated to \u00admental health charities. The publishers of the Italian, French and Spanish \u00adeditions have said they will match the donations.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea was a very knee-jerk reaction I think,\u201d said Thorogood. \u201cI was in shock for a few days and I think I felt desperate to do something. It was after a conversation I had with my dad, where we agreed that good things had to come of this for our own sakes. We\u2019d heard from others who\u2019d lost loved ones that the pain never goes and your life is never the same.

      "bodyText": "Zoe Thorogood was walking back to her flat in Bradford last month when she got the call. For two days she had been trying to track down her younger brother, but with no luck. The 26-year-old graphic novelist had sent James \u201csome funny reels on Instagram, and they were ignored\u201d. This wasn\u2019t unusual \u2013 sometimes he would take days to get back to her. \u201cBut it was when his girlfriend messaged me saying that James hadn\u2019t seen her message in 10 hours that I phoned him. His phone was off. I then phoned mum and it all exploded from there.\u201d Nobody knew where James was. His absence was reported to the police, which Thorogood calls a \u201chideously infuriating experience\u201d, leading her to try to track him down through friends and online contacts. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when I started to panic because they also claimed to know nothing,\u201d she says. \u201cI walked home and as I was around 50 metres from my flat, my dad phoned. He was crying. Dad doesn\u2019t cry. I knew what that meant. He just told me to come home, and nothing more. I just remember falling on to the floor screaming in the street.\u201d James had taken his own life. And once the dust had begun to settle from the bomb that had been thrown under the family, Thorogood decided she had to do something to help other families like them, and perhaps stop what happened to James, \u201cnow eternally 23\u201d, happening to others. Thorogood has a platform and a following, as one of Britain\u2019s top young graphic novelists. Last year, at the famous San Diego comic convention, she was nominated for five Eisner awards, the comics industry\u2019s Oscars, almost unprecedented for such a young creator. She debuted as a graphic novelist in 2020 with The Impending Blindness of Billie Scott, published by Avery Hill and based on her own experiences of when it was feared she might lose her sight as a child, and her major breakthrough work was It\u2019s Lonely at the Centre of the Earth, an autobiographical tale of her own battles with depression and mental ill health, which brought her international attention. Her work, she says, \u201cfeels worthless right now. I\u2019ve had people claim that my work may have \u2018saved their lives\u2019, yet, I couldn\u2019t even \u2018save\u2019 my own brother. I think being a \u2018mental health artist\u2019, or whatever you want to call me, and going through this feels like a giant hand coming out of the clouds and pointing at me and laughing. I know this feeling is temporary, but right now, I hate art.\u201d But in the wake of James\u2019s death she announced that all profits from It\u2019s Lonely at the Centre of The Earth, which was published by US comics giant Image, will be donated to mental health charities. The publishers of the Italian, French and Spanish editions have said they will match the donations. \u201cThe idea was a very knee-jerk reaction I think,\u201d said Thorogood. \u201cI was in shock for a few days and I think I felt desperate to do something. It was after a conversation I had with my dad, where we agreed that good things had to come of this for our own sakes. We\u2019d heard from others who\u2019d lost loved ones that the pain never goes and your life is never the same. And we just decided that\u2019s not us. \u201cSo even if I had to force it, I need positive things to come of this. For my own mental health. Maybe that\u2019s selfish but I figure an initiative like this is helping everyone, so whatever.

      "body": "<p>To attend a Trump rally in rural America makes you worry for humanity\u2019s future. After six hours in the baking sun watching 60,000-plus Trump supporters lap up his lies, I am here to tell you that there are few more lowering experiences to be had in modern politics.</p> <p>But it isn\u2019t all we have, and there is much of a positive nature to report from the US, including an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/10/obama-kamala-harris-pennsylvania-trump\">inspiring intervention</a> from Barack Obama last week and the truth that the Democratic candidate for presidency, Kamala Harris, is conducting a very good campaign indeed. Given that she\u2019s had just three months to pick her running mate, coordinate strategy and key messaging, and confront a wretchedly divided nation, she\u2019s performing with grace and steadiness, while the campaign has united around building a coalition with disaffected Republicans and conservatives of conscience who were in Congress or the Trump administration.</p> <p>For the first time since July, when Harris became the Democratic candidate, the <em>New York Times</em>/Siena College poll <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/08/us/elections/times-siena-poll-likely-electorate-crosstabs.html\">shows her leading Trump</a> by three points, 49-46. In the average maintained by <em>The Hill</em> website she is showing a lead of 3.4. Sure, both are within the margin of error and the contest in the seven swing states is much tighter, but the trends are in her favour. She is improving on the key issues of economy and migration and is becoming the candidate of change.</p> <p>A persistent Maga attack line over the last months was that she was too scared, ignorant or dumb to do interviews. She answered it by sitting down with Alex Cooper\u2019s <em>Call </em><em>Her Daddy</em> podcast, giving a fascinating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/08/kamala-harris-howard-stern-interview\">interview to Howard Stern\u2019s radio show</a>, sharing a beer with Stephen Colbert on his late-night show, and announcing, on Whoopi Goldberg\u2019s <em>The View</em> that, if she won, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/08/harris-medicare-long-term-home-care\">Medicare would pay for home care</a>. Finally, she faced the remorseless Bill Whitaker in the <em>60 Minutes</em> interview, an October ordeal for presidential candidates for the last 50 years. She carried herself well and was never less than poised. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/27/what-i-learned-about-kamala-harris-over-our-oscars-dinner\">As I wrote in this paper</a>, I once spent a few hours with her at a social event and liked her a lot but, after seeing those five shows, I feel a duty to note that she can be extraordinarily slippery when it comes to answering questions.</p> <p>Yet she is abiding by all the rules of the democratic game, unlike Donald Trump who refuses to engage in the process and tours his own rallies, ranting and lying, and looking somehow more lumpen and angrier than ever before. Naturally, he <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/01/media/trump-backs-out-60-minutes-interview-cbs/index.html\">pulled out of the </a><em><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/01/media/trump-backs-out-60-minutes-interview-cbs/index.html\">60 Minutes</a></em><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/01/media/trump-backs-out-60-minutes-interview-cbs/index.html\"> interview</a>, first saying that he didn\u2019t want to be fact checked, then demanding an apology from his previous interviewer Lesley Stahl for something she hadn\u2019t done. There was a fuss about the edit of the Harris programme, which Maga claimed showed the vice-president in a favourable light \u2013 it didn\u2019t \u2013 but before that got traction the news moved on with two newspaper articles.</p> <p>The <em>New York Times</em> ran a story logging <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/us/politics/trump-speeches-age-cognitive-decline.html\">Trump\u2019s mental decline</a>, then, seemingly to prove its point, Trump took himself to the swing state of Michigan last Thursday and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/10/trump-calls-detroit-michigan-mess\">trashed the city of Detroit </a>in a speech to, yes, the Detroit Economic Club. The <em>Washington Post</em> published exclusives from Bob Woodward\u2019s new book <em>War</em> that revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/10/kremlin-confirms-reports-donald-trump-sent-vladimir-putin-covid-tests\">Trump sent Covid tests to Putin</a> and had spoken to him from Mar-a-Lago, the country club where he was alleged to have kept stolen secret documents in a bathroom. The most <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/lindsey-graham-compared-mar-a-lago-to-north-korea-bob-woodward\">delightful revelation</a> was a quote from Republican senator Lindsey Graham. \u201cGoing to Mar-a-Lago is like being in North Korea. Everybody stands up and claps every time Trump comes in.\u201d One further positive note. Harris has pulled in over $1bn in campaign donations and is outspending Trump&nbsp;on social media, which is smart because 16&nbsp;million young people have joined the electorate since 2020. <a href=\"https://x.com/FT/status/1824158425221124290\">Latest figures show</a> she\u2019s spent $57m&nbsp;with Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, to Trump\u2019s $6m, and on Google, owner of YouTube, $31.5m compared with Trump\u2019s $9.3m.</p> <p>I spent the week in the state of Pennsylvania, which is the epicentre of the race because it has 19 electoral college votes \u2013 the most of any swing state. If a candidate wins by just a handful of individual ballots, he or she will take all the state\u2019s 19 electoral college votes, and probably go on to win the White House.</p> <p>The race is effectively tied and both candidates are putting enormous effort into the state. Trump appeared there twice last week, most theatrically at a big rally in the western town of Butler, 35 miles from Pittsburgh, and where he was winged by a would-be assassin&nbsp;three months ago. It was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/06/donald-trump-makes-a-theatrical-return-to-butler-scene-of-assassination-attempt\">triumphant return</a>, with much fanfare and many turns and speakers, including JD&nbsp;Vance and a goofy-looking Elon Musk in \u201cdark\u201d Maga cap. Halfway between a revivalist meeting and a country fair, the event told me a lot about the Maga cult but nothing about politics or Trump\u2019s plans (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/14/project-2025-election\">Project 2025</a> is never mentioned). However, I did establish the truth of rumours that hundreds of people leave his rallies as soon as he starts&nbsp;speaking.</p> <p>Last Wednesday, the splendidly principled conservative politician Liz Cheney, who appeared briefly with Harris on <em>60 Minutes</em> after endorsing her, hosted a session at Glenside, Pennsylvania, with three female former staffers in the Trump White House who provided insights into Trump\u2019s character and the chaos he brought to every issue and situation. This was peripheral to the main campaign but the impact of coherent and respected Republicans speaking against Trump may bring critical votes to Harris. Every vote matters. \u201cDon\u2019t boo,\u201d Obama routinely&nbsp;says, \u201cVote!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Republicans will listen to Obama because, despite the last nine years, ideas of decency and service still have a potent appeal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Obama made his first appearance for Harris in Pittsburgh, last Thursday, reclaiming the territory in western Pennsylvania from the Trump rally five days before. The speech was among the best he\u2019s ever given, ranking among his appeals to the American public during the 2008 presidential campaign and the wonderful acceptance speech I saw him make in Chicago. He <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/tv/news/barack-obama-trump-joke-diaper-b2627647.html\">teased Trump remorselessly</a>, mocking his lies, the obsession with money, power and status and his \u201cconcepts of a plan\u201d. He imagined Trump doing something normal like changing a tyre or a nappy. Someone in the audience shouted out, \u201chis own\u201d. Obama smiled and said he\u2019d thought of that joke but resisted the temptation. This drives Trump and Maga to distraction because, like all those with fascist leanings, they cannot stand people making fun of them. Humour will be an important weapon in the next 23 days because the Democrats need to get under his skin and provoke him to show his truly toxic, bullying nature.</p> <p>Obama\u2019s speech was important for its moral indignation, and it may just be the start of national rejection of Trump\u2019s lies, a kind of have-you-no-sense-of-decency moment that recalls the time in 1954 when a lawyer named <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/investigations/mccarthy-hearings/have-you-no-sense-of-decency.htm\">Joseph Welch stood up to Joe&nbsp;McCarthy</a> and ended his communist witch-hunt. It could be that Trump and Maga have overreached themselves with their lies about emergency funding after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hurricane-helene\">Hurricane Helene </a>ripped through the south-east causing destruction and hundreds of deaths; in one case a family of 11 was wiped out in a mudslide.</p> <p>According to Obama: \u201cDonald Trump just started making up stories about the Biden administration withholding aid from Republican areas and siphoning off aid to give to immigrants\u2026 you\u2019ve got a guy who lies to score political points. I want to ask Republicans out there, when did that become OK? Why would we go along with that?\u201d</p> <p>Obama is practically the only person in America who has the moral authority to make this speech. He and his wife, Michelle, are still the most popular and trusted public figures in the country. Republicans will listen to him because, despite the last nine years, ideas of decency and service still have a potent appeal here.</p> <p>What do I think will happen? I agree with the Democratic activist I met in Philadelphia who said: \u201cWe\u2019re&nbsp;winning, but we haven\u2019t won yet.\u201d It\u2019s all to play for and in Harris the Democrats have an authentic and tireless candidate who would do the best job she could in the White House.</p> <p>But let me just warn that even if she wins on 5&nbsp;November, Trump will not accept defeat. There is evidence that Republicans are building a case to challenge the result by manipulating the late polls in his favour so that any Democratic victory looks like a steal. There will be months of dispute, agonising waits and, I&nbsp;am afraid, intolerable anxiety for us all. But, as Obama says: \u201cWe gotta keep hoping.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Henry Porter is a writer and journalist specialising in liberty and civil rights</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 October 2024 because an earlier version said that Hurricane Helene \u201cripped through the south-west\u201d. In fact the hurricane affected the south-east region. </p>",

      "bodyText": "To attend a Trump rally in rural America makes you worry for humanity\u2019s future. After six hours in the baking sun watching 60,000-plus Trump supporters lap up his lies, I am here to tell you that there are few more lowering experiences to be had in modern politics. But it isn\u2019t all we have, and there is much of a positive nature to report from the US, including an inspiring intervention from Barack Obama last week and the truth that the Democratic candidate for presidency, Kamala Harris, is conducting a very good campaign indeed. Given that she\u2019s had just three months to pick her running mate, coordinate strategy and key messaging, and confront a wretchedly divided nation, she\u2019s performing with grace and steadiness, while the campaign has united around building a coalition with disaffected Republicans and conservatives of conscience who were in Congress or the Trump administration. For the first time since July, when Harris became the Democratic candidate, the New York Times/Siena College poll shows her leading Trump by three points, 49-46. In the average maintained by The Hill website she is showing a lead of 3.4. Sure, both are within the margin of error and the contest in the seven swing states is much tighter, but the trends are in her favour. She is improving on the key issues of economy and migration and is becoming the candidate of change. A persistent Maga attack line over the last months was that she was too scared, ignorant or dumb to do interviews. She answered it by sitting down with Alex Cooper\u2019s Call Her Daddy podcast, giving a fascinating interview to Howard Stern\u2019s radio show, sharing a beer with Stephen Colbert on his late-night show, and announcing, on Whoopi Goldberg\u2019s The View that, if she won, Medicare would pay for home care. Finally, she faced the remorseless Bill Whitaker in the 60 Minutes interview, an October ordeal for presidential candidates for the last 50 years. She carried herself well and was never less than poised. As I wrote in this paper, I once spent a few hours with her at a social event and liked her a lot but, after seeing those five shows, I feel a duty to note that she can be extraordinarily slippery when it comes to answering questions. Yet she is abiding by all the rules of the democratic game, unlike Donald Trump who refuses to engage in the process and tours his own rallies, ranting and lying, and looking somehow more lumpen and angrier than ever before. Naturally, he pulled out of the 60 Minutes interview, first saying that he didn\u2019t want to be fact checked, then demanding an apology from his previous interviewer Lesley Stahl for something she hadn\u2019t done. There was a fuss about the edit of the Harris programme, which Maga claimed showed the vice-president in a favourable light \u2013 it didn\u2019t \u2013 but before that got traction the news moved on with two newspaper articles. The New York Times ran a story logging Trump\u2019s mental decline, then, seemingly to prove its point, Trump took himself to the swing state of Michigan last Thursday and trashed the city of Detroit in a speech to, yes, the Detroit Economic Club. The Washington Post published exclusives from Bob Woodward\u2019s new book War that revealed that Trump sent Covid tests to Putin and had spoken to him from Mar-a-Lago, the country club where he was alleged to have kept stolen secret documents in a bathroom. The most delightful revelation was a quote from Republican senator Lindsey Graham. \u201cGoing to Mar-a-Lago is like being in North Korea. Everybody stands up and claps every time Trump comes in.\u201d One further positive note. Harris has pulled in over $1bn in campaign donations and is outspending Trump on social media, which is smart because 16 million young people have joined the electorate since 2020. Latest figures show she\u2019s spent $57m with Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, to Trump\u2019s $6m, and on Google, owner of YouTube, $31.5m compared with Trump\u2019s $9.3m. I spent the week in the state of Pennsylvania, which is the epicentre of the race because it has 19 electoral college votes \u2013 the most of any swing state. If a candidate wins by just a handful of individual ballots, he or she will take all the state\u2019s 19 electoral college votes, and probably go on to win the White House. The race is effectively tied and both candidates are putting enormous effort into the state. Trump appeared there twice last week, most theatrically at a big rally in the western town of Butler, 35 miles from Pittsburgh, and where he was winged by a would-be assassin three months ago. It was a triumphant return, with much fanfare and many turns and speakers, including JD Vance and a goofy-looking Elon Musk in \u201cdark\u201d Maga cap. Halfway between a revivalist meeting and a country fair, the event told me a lot about the Maga cult but nothing about politics or Trump\u2019s plans (Project 2025 is never mentioned). However, I did establish the truth of rumours that hundreds of people leave his rallies as soon as he starts speaking. Last Wednesday, the splendidly principled conservative politician Liz Cheney, who appeared briefly with Harris on 60 Minutes after endorsing her, hosted a session at Glenside, Pennsylvania, with three female former staffers in the Trump White House who provided insights into Trump\u2019s character and the chaos he brought to every issue and situation. This was peripheral to the main campaign but the impact of coherent and respected Republicans speaking against Trump may bring critical votes to Harris. Every vote matters. \u201cDon\u2019t boo,\u201d Obama routinely says, \u201cVote!\u201d Obama made his first appearance for Harris in Pittsburgh, last Thursday, reclaiming the territory in western Pennsylvania from the Trump rally five days before. The speech was among the best he\u2019s ever given, ranking among his appeals to the American public during the 2008 presidential campaign and the wonderful acceptance speech I saw him make in Chicago. He teased Trump remorselessly, mocking his lies, the obsession with money, power and status and his \u201cconcepts of a plan\u201d. He imagined Trump doing something normal like changing a tyre or a nappy. Someone in the audience shouted out, \u201chis own\u201d. Obama smiled and said he\u2019d thought of that joke but resisted the temptation. This drives Trump and Maga to distraction because, like all those with fascist leanings, they cannot stand people making fun of them. Humour will be an important weapon in the next 23 days because the Democrats need to get under his skin and provoke him to show his truly toxic, bullying nature. Obama\u2019s speech was important for its moral indignation, and it may just be the start of national rejection of Trump\u2019s lies, a kind of have-you-no-sense-of-decency moment that recalls the time in 1954 when a lawyer named Joseph Welch stood up to Joe McCarthy and ended his communist witch-hunt. It could be that Trump and Maga have overreached themselves with their lies about emergency funding after Hurricane Helene ripped through the south-east causing destruction and hundreds of deaths; in one case a family of 11 was wiped out in a mudslide. According to Obama: \u201cDonald Trump just started making up stories about the Biden administration withholding aid from Republican areas and siphoning off aid to give to immigrants\u2026 you\u2019ve got a guy who lies to score political points. I want to ask Republicans out there, when did that become OK? Why would we go along with that?\u201d Obama is practically the only person in America who has the moral authority to make this speech. He and his wife, Michelle, are still the most popular and trusted public figures in the country. Republicans will listen to him because, despite the last nine years, ideas of decency and service still have a potent appeal here. What do I think will happen? I agree with the Democratic activist I met in Philadelphia who said: \u201cWe\u2019re winning, but we haven\u2019t won yet.\u201d It\u2019s all to play for and in Harris the Democrats have an authentic and tireless candidate who would do the best job she could in the White House. But let me just warn that even if she wins on 5 November, Trump will not accept defeat. There is evidence that Republicans are building a case to challenge the result by manipulating the late polls in his favour so that any Democratic victory looks like a steal. There will be months of dispute, agonising waits and, I am afraid, intolerable anxiety for us all. But, as Obama says: \u201cWe gotta keep hoping.\u201d \u2022 Henry Porter is a writer and journalist specialising in liberty and civil rights \u2022 This article was amended on 13 October 2024 because an earlier version said that Hurricane Helene \u201cripped through the south-west\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Another week, another rip-roaring West Country derby. This time, though, it was an increasingly rampant Bath who headed home with the bragging rights after recovering from an 11-point deficit to collect an eight-try victory and their highest points tally against their neighbours in the fabled history of this fixture. In addition to two close-range tries for prop Beno Obano, Bath\u2019s success was based on their better decision-making, breakdown superiority and surer execution under pressure. Ted Hill and Ollie Lawrence were outstanding and there was a visible desire to atone for the disappointing home loss to Bristol at the Rec last Saturday. Six second-half tries also further underlined the quality of their bench resources. It was harsh on a few Cherry and White individuals. Ollie Thorley on the right wing was like a man possessed, Zach Mercer and Josh Hathaway had their eye-catching moments and the young England Under-20 prop Afolabi Fasogbon once again looked a significant talent in the making.

      "body": "<p>The trial of a 71-year-old man has gripped France and horrified the world after he admitted to repeatedly drugging his wife and, over the course of decades, soliciting dozens of men online to rape her while she was unconscious. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/dominique-pelicot-rape-trial\">Dominique Pelicot</a>\u2019s confessions as well as the public bravery of his wife Gis\u00e8le have forced a nationwide reckoning over sexual assault and the double lives people lead through the internet.</p> \n<p>As a court in Avignon has heard Pelicot\u2019s case and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/17/dominique-pelicot-france-rape-trial-testimony\">allegations against 50 other defendants</a> over the last several weeks, a pattern has emerged of men who lived publicly upstanding lives while allegedly engaging in abhorrent acts online and in private. As the men accused of mass rape have taken the stand, they have detailed how Pelicot found them and coordinated his abuse on an illicit chat forum called Coco.</p> \n<p>What has emerged during the trial is that the scale of Pelicot\u2019s crimes and his ability to keep them concealed for so many years would seemingly not have been possible without Coco and its administrators\u2019 disregard for the content being shared on the platform. The site has become one of the starkest examples in memory of how platforms can result in extreme harm when left unmoderated.</p> \n<p>Since its founding in 2003, Coco has been implicated in killings, pedophilia, homophobic attacks and sexual assaults as it evaded accountability and led law enforcement on an international manhunt. When European authorities finally shut down Coco earlier this year and arrested its founder along with other executives, the website had been cited in more than 23,000 reports of criminal activity and more than 480 victims had been involved in judicial proceedings involving the site, according to French prosecutors.</p> \n<h2>A haven for online harm</h2> \n<p>Founded by the software engineer Isaac Steidl while he was in his early 20s, Coco launched as a free chat site with a simple interface allowing users to communicate anonymously. Although the site asked users to confirm that they were over 18, they could quickly change their age once they gained access to the platform and chat with an invented username.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt looked so innocent. It was this very 90s design, with coconut trees and a smiley face and it said \u201cthis is a website for nice people,\u201d said Sophie Antoine, an officer for legal advocacy at the French anti-child prostitution organization ACPE. \u201cBut you went in, and it was like a jungle.\u201d</p> \n<p>Users would encounter a public landing page once registered to the site, which featured a list of different chat forums dedicated to different subjects. The sexualized nature of the site meant that many of these forums were dedicated to specific fetishes or contained explicit content. People could also enter private chats on Coco and directly message other users, which one French journalist <a href=\"https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/grand-est/marne/reims/j-ai-teste-pour-vous-le-site-de-chat-en-ligne-coco-gg-repaire-a-pedophiles-et-predateurs-sexuels-2959685.html\">pretending to be a 15-year-old girl</a> on the site found resulted in a flood of people soliciting them for sex and sending nude images.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was very accessible and very explicit \u2013 there was no control over it,\u201d Antoine said.</p> \n<p>Although it never gained mainstream popularity, the site became well known among child safety advocates and LGBTQ+ rights groups monitoring sites with the potential for online harm. ACPE had been involved with work on Coco for years, with Antoine training people on how to use the site for research purposes while alerting authorities to illicit and dangerous activity there.</p> \n<p>In Pelicot\u2019s case, he used an anonymous pseudonym on Coco and solicited men on a forum called \u201c<em>\u00e0 son insu</em>\u201d, meaning \u201cwithout her knowledge\u201d, to come to his house in the small town of Mazan. Pelicot claimed on the forum that he and his wife shared a fetish for men having sex with her while she was asleep, not openly mentioning that he was drugging her against her will and that she had no knowledge or consent of his abuse. While many of the men claimed they believed they were engaging in a consensual sexual roleplay, investigators found that several times Pelicot also explicitly used the words \u201crape\u201d and described drugging his wife to potential attackers.</p> \n<p>Coco was unmoderated to the extent that Pelicot was able to use the forum for years without any penalty, and authorities ultimately only became aware of him after a grocery store security guard caught Pelicot attempting to take nonconsensual videos of women who were shopping in 2020. In the unlikely event that a user did get kicked off Coco due to complaints or legal threats, researchers and authorities say the site would charge a small fee of about \u20ac10 to reinstate banned accounts.</p> \n<p>Despite the site becoming a well-known haven for online abuses, rights groups and authorities faced various legal hurdles in investigating and taking legal action against it. European Union regulations for years had broad provisions that prevented a website owner from being held legally liable for the content on their site, similar to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/27/section-230-congress-hearing-facebook-twitter-google\">Section 230 law in the US</a>. Coco also moved where it was registered, complicating matters by moving \u2013 after Pelicot\u2019s arrest in 2020 \u2013 from being a wholly French site to a domain registered to the self-governing island of Guernsey under a .gg URL.</p> \n<p>Holding Steidl accountable for the site he created also faced another logistical hurdle \u2013 at some point after founding the site, he moved to Bulgaria, outside the immediate reach of French authorities, and renounced his French citizenship. Even as Coco was publicly implicated in a string of violence and sexual abuse, the site remained online, with Steidl nowhere to be found.</p> \n<h2>Killings, attacks and child abuse</h2> \n<p>While Pelicot was using Coco to perpetrate his attacks, a slew of other abuses were taking place in forums and chats throughout the site. For years, a number of high-profile crimes involving Coco received widespread news coverage in France and increased calls among rights groups to shut the platform down.</p> \n<p>One of earliest cases was the 2018 killing of 55-year-old Michel Sollossi, who was killed by a 22-year-old man who had arranged to meet up with him on Coco. Sollossi was found beaten to death in his home in the Paris suburbs, with a trial finding that the killing was a homophobic attack. The perpetrator was sentenced to 20 years in prison.</p> \n<p>A wave of similar \u201cambush attacks\u201d on gay men who were lured to meet up with strangers on Coco followed. In 2022, a 24-year-old from Marseille alleged that he narrowly escaped an attack by three people who tried to run him over with their car when he arrived at a meetup arranged through Coco. Law enforcement officials arrested four people in the town of Saint-Polois earlier this year after they were accused of posing as men looking for hookups on the site then luring victims to meet them before violently attacking and robbing them.</p> \n<p>While violent attacks ambushing gay men proliferated on the platform, the site was also used for child sexual abuse. A man from the north-western French city of Brest <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2024/06/25/fermeture-du-site-coco-23-051-procedures-etaient-engagees-contre-le-tchat-connu-pour-ses-contenus-illegaux_6243648_3224.html\">admitted in 2019</a> to exchanging videos of child rape using the same \u201cwithout her knowledge\u201d forum as Pelicot. In one of the most high-profile cases, the 77-year-old former French pop star Richard Dewitte was arrested after sexually soliciting an undercover officer whom he believed was a 13-year-old girl. A court sentenced Dewitte to <a href=\"https://www.20minutes.fr/justice/4053726-20230919-richard-dewitte-condamne-trois-ans-prison-corruption-mineure\">three years in prison</a> last year.</p> \n<p>In yet another case, two teenage boys were <a href=\"https://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/meurtre-de-philippe-coopman-guet-apens-mobile-antecedents-ce-quil-faut-retenir-de-la-conference-de-presse-de-la-procureure-19-04-2024-7RPRLV4KTZC2LP3UF736KCS6J4.php\">arrested earlier this year</a> and charged with the killing of a 22-year-old man in a suburb of Dunkirk. The two boys allegedly pretended to be a girl looking to meet up on Coco, before ambushing the man and beating him to death in a parking lot when he showed up.</p> \n<p>The myriad of cases drew the attention of French LGBTQ+ rights groups such as SOS Homophobie and child protection organizations such as ACPE, which began calling for authorities to take more aggressive action against the site.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have been talking about it for years and asking for it to be closed,\u201d Antoine said. \u201cBut it was complicated with all the different European laws.\u201d</p> \n<h2>The end of Coco</h2> \n<p>Coco\u2019s ability to evade authorities relied on a combination of legal protections for internet providers, the complicated logistics of international investigations and obscured origins. Sites seeking to avoid scrutiny use a variety of tools to mask exactly where they are operating, forcing law enforcement to peel back layers of obfuscations before finding the origins and owners of a site.</p> \n<p>When authorities finally came for Coco, it involved an immense, 18-month international effort and a recent change in French law. In December 2023, France\u2019s national anti-organized crime authority Junalco launched an investigation into Coco that utilized a 2023 law called \u201c<em>d\u00e9lit d\u2019administration de plateforme</em>\u201d, which can hold administrators liable for certain activities on their sites. The law allows authorities to accuse site founders of complicity in crimes such as their sites or apps being used for illicit transactions that fund gangs. Violations carry penalties of up to 10 years in jail as well as fines up to \u20ac500,000.</p> \n<p>Prosecutors used the same law to issue a preliminary charge against the billionaire Telegram CEO, Pavel Durov, following his arrest earlier this year. Durov\u2019s arrest <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/france-telegram-pavel-durov-arrest-6e213d227458f330ed16e7fe221a696c\">gained international attention</a> and prompted a debate over the extent to which governments should hold platforms accountable for illegal content.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3d444b1a-e1c0-49c7-9591-001a5f9d7306\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GMh-_LB87k8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Along with Junalco, agencies from countries including Lithuania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Germany and the Netherlands coordinated an effort to bring Coco down in June of this year. International authorities shut down servers based in Germany, seized about \u20ac5.6m and froze several bank accounts related to the site. In Bulgaria, local authorities arrested and interviewed Steidl with French prosecutors present as observers. Three of Steidl\u2019s associates including his wife were also detained for questioning in France and later released, <a href=\"https://www.lefigaro.fr/faits-divers/pedophilie-guets-apens-homophobes-le-parquet-de-paris-annonce-la-fermeture-du-site-coco-gg-20240625\">according</a> to national media and a Junalco press release.</p> \n<p>French prosecutors have not issued statements on what the next steps in the criminal case involving Coco and Steidl may be, but the site remains offline. LGBTQ+ rights groups and anti-child abuse organizations have celebrated the closure while warning that similar sites may fill the vacuum.</p> \n<p>The Pelicot trial is meanwhile still ongoing as French society grapples with how such acts, committed by men from a variety of ages and backgrounds, could go undetected for so long. It\u2019s a question that advocates against sexual abuse say involves the country reconsidering how these crimes happen, and who perpetrates them.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are trying to dismantle the idea that these criminals are monsters,\u201d Antoine said. \u201cThe Mazan case showed with websites like Coco these people can be your neighbors \u2013 even in the smallest town people can connect online and commit these crimes.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Kari Paul contributed reporting</em></p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 November 2024 to clarify that Coco\u2019s move to a Guernsey-registered URL ocurred after Dominique Pelicot\u2019s arrest.</p>",

Dominique Pelicot\u2019s confessions as well as the public bravery of his wife Gis\u00e8le have forced a nationwide reckoning over sexual assault and the double lives people lead through the internet.

In 2022, a 24-year-old from Marseille alleged that he narrowly escaped an attack by three people who tried to run him over with their car when he arrived at a meetup arranged through Coco. Law enforcement officials arrested four people in the town of Saint-Polois earlier this year after they were accused of posing as men looking for hookups on the site then luring victims to meet them before violently attacking and robbing them. While violent attacks ambushing gay men proliferated on the platform, the site was also used for child sexual abuse. A man from the north-western French city of Brest admitted in 2019 to exchanging videos of child rape using the same \u201cwithout her knowledge\u201d forum as Pelicot. In one of the most high-profile cases, the 77-year-old former French pop star Richard Dewitte was arrested after sexually soliciting an undercover officer whom he believed was a 13-year-old girl. A court sentenced Dewitte to three years in prison last year. In yet another case, two teenage boys were arrested earlier this year and charged with the killing of a 22-year-old man in a suburb of Dunkirk. The two boys allegedly pretended to be a girl looking to meet up on Coco, before ambushing the man and beating him to death in a parking lot when he showed up. The myriad of cases drew the attention of French LGBTQ+ rights groups such as SOS Homophobie and child protection organizations such as ACPE, which began calling for authorities to take more aggressive action against the site. \u201cWe have been talking about it for years and asking for it to be closed,\u201d Antoine said. \u201cBut it was complicated with all the different European laws.\u201d The end of Coco Coco\u2019s ability to evade authorities relied on a combination of legal protections for internet providers, the complicated logistics of international investigations and obscured origins. Sites seeking to avoid scrutiny use a variety of tools to mask exactly where they are operating, forcing law enforcement to peel back layers of obfuscations before finding the origins and owners of a site. When authorities finally came for Coco, it involved an immense, 18-month international effort and a recent change in French law. In December 2023, France\u2019s national anti-organized crime authority Junalco launched an investigation into Coco that utilized a 2023 law called \u201cd\u00e9lit d\u2019administration de plateforme\u201d, which can hold administrators liable for certain activities on their sites. The law allows authorities to accuse site founders of complicity in crimes such as their sites or apps being used for illicit transactions that fund gangs. Violations carry penalties of up to 10 years in jail as well as fines up to \u20ac500,000. Prosecutors used the same law to issue a preliminary charge against the billionaire Telegram CEO, Pavel Durov, following his arrest earlier this year. Durov\u2019s arrest gained international attention and prompted a debate over the extent to which governments should hold platforms accountable for illegal content. Along with Junalco, agencies from countries including Lithuania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Germany and the Netherlands coordinated an effort to bring Coco down in June of this year. International authorities shut down servers based in Germany, seized about \u20ac5.6m and froze several bank accounts related to the site. In Bulgaria, local authorities arrested and interviewed Steidl with French prosecutors present as observers. Three of Steidl\u2019s associates including his wife were also detained for questioning in France and later released, according to national media and a Junalco press release. French prosecutors have not issued statements on what the next steps in the criminal case involving Coco and Steidl may be, but the site remains offline. LGBTQ+ rights groups and anti-child abuse organizations have celebrated the closure while warning that similar sites may fill the vacuum. The Pelicot trial is meanwhile still ongoing as French society grapples with how such acts, committed by men from a variety of ages and backgrounds, could go undetected for so long. It\u2019s a question that advocates against sexual abuse say involves the country reconsidering how these crimes happen, and who perpetrates them. \u201cWe are trying to dismantle the idea that these criminals are monsters,\u201d Antoine said. \u201cThe Mazan case showed with websites like Coco these people can be your neighbors \u2013 even in the smallest town people can connect online and commit these crimes.\u201d Kari Paul contributed reporting \u2022 This article was amended on 20 November 2024 to clarify that Coco\u2019s move to a Guernsey-registered URL ocurred after Dominique Pelicot\u2019s arrest.",

It is no secret that Ineos Britannia work closely with Mercedes, modern yachts being likened in some quarters to F1 cars on water. Brains from Mercedes have been deployed to work on design and engineering; the instances of overlap are numerous and it is the most potent example of Ineos\u2019 vision to share expertise and methodology between their different sports.</p> <p><strong>What has their outlay been?</strong> \u00a3110m was put towards Ainslie\u2019s bid to win the trophy in 2021; a similar sum is likely to have been put into this year\u2019s high-profile attempt.</p> <p><strong>How much success have they enjoyed?</strong> The 2021 bid fell short, with a defeat to Italy in the match-up to decide who would challenge the mighty New Zealand. But this time around they have been in outstanding form, outdoing Switzerland and then the Italians. That is an achievement in itself but success will ultimately be measured by the multiple Olympic gold medallist Ainslie\u2019s ability to bring home the America\u2019s Cup. Pulling it off would be Ineos\u2019s greatest sporting feat to date.</p> <h2><strong>Football</strong></h2> <p><strong>What did they inherit?</strong> Three challenges of increasing gravity. Ineos dipped their toe into football\u2019s shark-infested water by buying the middling Swiss club Lausanne in 2017; two years later they purchased the Ligue 1 club OGC Nice, another historically mid-ranking side but with obvious potential. Earlier this year they completed the most eye-catching deal of all: a 27.7% stake in Manchester United, the biggest club in England and a creaking oil tanker that will take some turning around.</p> <p><strong>How have they tried to make their mark?</strong> Ineos learned costly lessons at Lausanne, courting fury early on by redesigning the club badge to incorporate an element of their own logo. Investment in infrastructure and a stream of signings indicated their ambition, although a flow of loanees from Nice has pointed to their place in the food chain. High-profile signings such as Ross Barkley and Aaron Ramsey have been among those signposting their intentions on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur. At United, the arrivals of a top-class sporting director in Dan Ashworth and a new chief executive in Omar Berrada, formerly of Manchester City, are intended to solve the off-pitch mess they discovered.</p>    <p><strong>What has their outlay been?</strong> Significant. While the sum paid for Lausanne is unknown, they are thought to have invested around \u00a345m \u2013 a large amount in Switzerland \u2013 since gaining control. The takeover of Nice cost \u00a388m and they have overseen a net spend of close to \u00a3100m on transfers. All this is blown away by the \u00a31.25bn investment in United.</p> <p><strong>How much success have they enjoyed?</strong> Any grand ambitions for Lausanne have yet to be realised: the club have yo-yo\u2019d and sit mid-table in the top flight. Nice are yet to sustain a credible challenge in Ligue 1, oscillating between ninth and fifth since 2020, but are playing Europa League football this year. At United, the joy of a quick FA Cup final win over City papered over cracks that have widened in a poor start to this season. Prevarication over the future of their manager, Erik ten Hag, has not helped Ineos\u2019 chances of creating a launchpad.</p> <h2><strong>Formula One</strong></h2> <p><strong>What did they inherit?</strong> Mercedes were at the peak of their powers in December 2020 when Ineos became a one-third shareholder in the team. The pair had already signed a five-year principal partnership earlier that year. Lewis Hamilton had won six of the previous seven drivers\u2019 championships and they had won every constructors\u2019 championship since coming second in 2013.</p> <p><strong>How have they tried to make their mark?</strong> Ineos are not particularly hands-on at Mercedes and Ratcliffe himself is rarely seen at grands prix, although their name is on the car. The expectation was that a team sitting atop the pile would continue their supremacy.</p> <p><strong>What has their outlay been?</strong> The five-year partnership is understood to be worth \u00a3100m, divided annually. The outlay for their stake is anyone\u2019s guess but could be north of \u00a3200m.</p> <p><strong>How much success have they enjoyed?</strong> Financially, Ratcliffe and Ineos will have few complaints. Last year they took a share of a \u00a375m dividend from the team, largely through healthy sponsorship revenues. On the track it has been downhill since Hamilton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/12/f1-max-verstappen-wins-abu-dhabi-gp-lewis-hamilton#:~:text=2%20years%20old-,Max%20Verstappen%20beats%20Lewis%20Hamilton%20to%20F1%20world,last%20lap%20in%20Abu%20Dhabi&amp;text=After%20a%20season%20of%20intense,its%20denouement%20in%20the%20desert.\">controversial loss to Max Verstappen</a> in 2021. Mercedes won the constructors\u2019 championship that year but the well has been dry since: they failed to react smartly to a regulation change in 2022, while Red Bull and recently McLaren have outshone them on race days. Hamilton will depart for Ferrari next year. In a fast-changing sport, though, the murmurings are they will be well placed to revive when the rules next alter in 2026.</p> <h2><strong>Cycling</strong></h2> <p><strong>What did they inherit?</strong> Ineos inherited a dominant, formidable, sometimes controversial winning machine when they took over Team Sky in May 2019. It was the sport\u2019s biggest success story, masterminded by the peerless team principal Brailsford: a lavishly funded operation that won grand tours for&nbsp;fun and became cycling\u2019s version of the <em>Galacticos</em>, turning the likes of Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome into superstars. The new-look Ineos Grenadiers had an imposing act to follow.</p> <p><strong>How have they tried to make their mark?</strong> Team Sky were brilliant but often unloved. Ineos sought to soften the hard edges, foster a less corporate and controlling image, and cut more of a relaxed appearance. They have sought to freshen up with young talent but are yet to nurture anyone who can replicate the presence and aura of those Sky&nbsp;greats. </p>    <p><strong>What has their outlay been?</strong> Ineos are thought to spend around \u20ac50m a year on the Grenadiers. They are still firmly among the best-resourced teams although the likes of UAE Team Emirates and Jumbo-Visma have ensured that, unlike during the Sky years, they no longer blow their rivals out of the water.</p> <p><strong>How much success have they enjoyed?</strong> Ineos Grenadiers have been left behind. A team that once led the way is a shadow of its former self and, beyond the evergreen Geraint Thomas, lacks a rider with the stardust to challenge for major podiums. There is an argument the decline can be traced to Brailsford\u2019s move upstairs, in December 2021, to become Ineos\u2019s director of sport across all disciplines. They have not won a grand tour since he became less hands-on and it raised eyebrows in July when Thomas described their leadership structure as \u201clike a coalition government\u201d. There is a feeling of drift, the aerodynamics expert Dan Bigham also criticising a lack of clear vision upon leaving in August. Young riders have generally failed to kick on and other teams are now bigger draws; meanwhile double Olympic gold medallist Tom Pidcock has recently been linked with a move away. Ineos must find clarity if they are to scale the heights of old.</p> <h2><strong>Rugby union</strong></h2> <p><strong>What did they inherit?</strong> The most famous, awe-inspiring rugby union brand in the world. Or at least serious involvement in it after announcing a six-year performance partnership in the summer of 2021, beginning the following year. The All Blacks and Black Ferns headlined the seven New Zealand national teams slated to benefit from Ineos\u2019s global network\u2019s six-year performance partnership.</p> <p><strong>How have they tried to make their mark?</strong> Promised partnerships with their other sporting arms, broadly aimed at using technology and human performance to make gains on the pitch. More visibly, their logo has appeared on the teams\u2019 playing shorts and training jerseys.</p> <p><strong>What has their outlay been?</strong> The deal is worth around \u00a34.3m a year, running until 2028.</p> <p><strong>How much success have they enjoyed?</strong> Rugby is in little position to turn down the level of financial assistance Ineos waved New Zealand\u2019s way but their involvement has met some scepticism. Greenpeace accused them of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d their reputation and almost 29,000 people signed a petition against the deal. The Black Ferns will expect to retain their world title next year so the 2027 men\u2019s World Cup may provide the best measure of any sporting gains added by Ineos. A return to the glory years would be a resounding success for an All Blacks team that finished runners-up last year and looks hard pressed to break South Africa\u2019s stranglehold.</p> <h2><strong>Running</strong></h2> <p><strong>What did they inherit?</strong> Early in 2022 Ineos confirmed a long-term partnership with NN Running Team. The star draw was Eliud Kipchoge, the greatest marathon runner of all time, who had consecutive Olympic golds and an ongoing world record to his name when the deal was struck. It was not unfamiliar territory: they had partnered with the team and Kipchoge two and a half years previously became the first person&nbsp;to run a full marathon in under two hours.</p> <p><strong>How have they tried to make their mark?</strong> The initial aim was to ensure Kipchoge completed a hat-trick of Olympic titles at Paris 2024, reuniting the setup that had backed him in 2019. As part of the deal, NN have access to Ineos\u2019 knowledge sharing network across sports they have invested in: those resources were drawn on as Kipchoge, along with a raft of other high-profile athletes on the team\u2019s books, prepared for the Games.</p> <p><strong>What has their outlay been?</strong> The figures are closely guarded. Ineos are listed as supporters of the team on the NN website while Ineos Grenadier, the 4x4 vehicle produced by Ineos Automotive, is cited as one of their suppliers.</p> <p><strong>How much success have they enjoyed?</strong> Kipchoge endured what he called his \u201cworst marathon\u201d in Paris, failing to finish due to a back injury and subsequently calling time on his Olympic career. But there was joy for Joshua Cheptegui, another NN runner, in the 10,000m and the headline among several teammates\u2019 medals at other major events was Wilson Kiplangat\u2019s marathon gold at the 2023 world championships. NN\u2019s expanding stable stretches beyond the legendary Kipchoge.</p>",

Ineos are listed as supporters of the team on the NN website while Ineos Grenadier, the 4x4 vehicle produced by Ineos Automotive, is cited as one of their suppliers. How much success have they enjoyed? Kipchoge endured what he called his \u201cworst marathon\u201d in Paris, failing to finish due to a back injury and subsequently calling time on his Olympic career. But there was joy for Joshua Cheptegui, another NN runner, in the 10,000m and the headline among several teammates\u2019 medals at other major events was Wilson Kiplangat\u2019s marathon gold at the 2023 world championships. NN\u2019s expanding stable stretches beyond the legendary Kipchoge.",

Here\u2019s the story behind it. A few years ago, tech journalist Carl Miller was approached by an IT expert, Chris Monteiro. The latter had got into the back end of a dark web hitman site. The site was a scam: it promised to murder people for a price, but only took the money and never ordered the hit.</p>    <p>Which seems\u2026 just a bit dark webby, really. But now Monteiro was inside the site, he was scared that the people ordering the hit would do it themselves if the bogus hitman didn\u2019t. He worried that the potential victims were in imminent danger. And <em>Kill List</em> starts with exactly this worst case scenario. In 2016, Stephen Allwine, a US church elder, paid for a scam hitman to kill his wife, Amy. When that didn\u2019t happen, he murdered her himself.</p> <p>But what should Miller do with a list of 600 potential victims from all around the world? How to let them know that someone wants them dead? And, once they know, how to persuade the police that this danger should be taken seriously? Episode two is occupied with this conundrum and is frustrating listening as a result. Miller agonises about how to tell the hit-ees and then does so very badly (he\u2019s so vague on the phone that they hang up, thinking he\u2019s a scammer).</p> <p>I could have done with a lot less of this and the \u201cOh, I\u2019m so tense\u201d stuff from Miller, but once the series gets going, it\u2019s gripping. The ordered hits are all personal, often the results of coercive relationships that have broken down. Such cases are notoriously difficult to get police to take seriously, especially when the threat appears to be online rather than \u201creal\u201d. One potential victim in Spain says, despairingly, that the police want a body before they do anything. Also, half-hearted police involvement can make things more dangerous for the potential victim. As Miller says, in episode four: \u201cIneffective police investigations are dangerously destabilising. It creates a shrinking window of opportunity that one of these perpetrators will feel compelled to act within.\u201d Thank goodness that Miller and his producers keep going: one particular case attracts FBI involvement and, after that, not only do prosecutions start happening, but the series really takes off. Get past the agonising and this is a really fascinating listen.</p>    <p>Last week, Kamala Harris appeared on the podcast <strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/call-her-daddy/id1418960261\">Call Her Daddy</a></strong>, to much sniffiness and snark. Donald Trump was rallying in Butler, Pennsylvania, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/06/donald-trump-makes-a-theatrical-return-to-butler-scene-of-assassination-attempt\">with Elon Musk his cheerleader </a>\u2013 surely Harris should be doing something more eye-catching. Well, maybe, but going on <em>Call Her Daddy</em> is not to be sniffed at. It\u2019s a huge show, second only to Joe Rogan in the US on Spotify, and is the most listened-to Spotify show by women. Hosted by Alex Cooper, it used to be quite saucy, with a sex tip every week, but has turned into a more informative, snappily edited listen, with Cooper interviewing celebrities and experts about relationships, sexual assault, trauma and mental health.</p> <p>Cooper \u201cagonised\u201d about interviewing Harris, she says, because she didn\u2019t want to alienate her Republican listeners, but \u201cmy goal today is not to change your political affiliation, what I\u2019m hoping is that you\u2019re able to listen to a conversation that isn\u2019t too different to the ones we\u2019re having here every week\u2026 on women\u2019s bodies and how we are treated and valued in this country\u201d. She\u2019s also asked Trump to come on the show. Still, judging by the social media comments, many of her listeners weren\u2019t convinced and have flounced in Trumpy disgust.</p> <p>To the UK ear, <em>Call Her Daddy</em> can be an abrasive listen. Cooper has that exaggerated reality show way of speaking, as though everything she says is highly significant. Plus, her questions to Harris really were softball at points: \u201cWhen people tell you no, when people look at you and doubt you, what does that ignite in you?\u201d Harris did well, though: engaging and warm, even a little slow and homely. \u201cI don\u2019t hear no,\u201d she said. Also, about when things go wrong: \u201cThink about where you had agency in that moment, don\u2019t let things just happen to you.\u201d From this interview, Harris needs to find a little more pizzazz, but she\u2019s definitely human.</p>    <p>Here\u2019s another couple-chatting podcast, but with a twist. <strong><a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/bojandkate\">Boj &amp; Kate Have a Lot on Their Plate</a></strong> sees <em><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/maybe-baby/id1639564908\">Maybe Baby</a></em> couple, presenter Kate Lawler and her husband, Martin \u201cBoj\u201d Bojtos, have a niggly, funny discussion before keen cook Boj explains a dish that he\u2019s made for Kate and their toddler Noa (hence, no more of the couple\u2019s popular <em>Maybe Baby</em> shows: they had the baby). Topics included several fun stories about mad neighbours, weird chiropractors, doing strange things when you\u2019re asleep. I expected the cooking to be more upfront \u2013 chicken and leek pie, yum! \u2013 but that\u2019s perhaps because I listened around teatime, when I was hungry. (The recipes can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bojandkate/\">@bojandkate</a> Instagram feed.) This is Lawler\u2019s show, anyway: she\u2019s spiky and silly, nuttily charismatic. Maybe one episode could be Boj trying to get her to concentrate long enough to make a sandwich.</p>    <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0b94jkt\">Johnny Walker</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0b94jkt\"> </a>has announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/oct/06/veteran-dj-johnnie-walker-to-retire-from-radio-after-58-years#:~:text=He%20began%20the%20announcement%20by,making%20a%20very%20sad%20announcement.\">he\u2019s leaving Radio 2 at the end of this month</a> due to his pulmonary fibrosis, a dignified bowing out from an exceptional broadcasting career.

Skinner was recently dumped by Absolute Radio in unceremonious manner, after 15 years presenting his well-loved Saturday morning show.

Donald Trump was rallying in Butler, Pennsylvania, with Elon Musk his cheerleader \u2013 surely Harris should be doing something more eye-catching. Well, maybe, but going on Call Her Daddy is not to be sniffed at. It\u2019s a huge show, second only to Joe Rogan in the US on Spotify, and is the most listened-to Spotify show by women. Hosted by Alex Cooper, it used to be quite saucy, with a sex tip every week, but has turned into a more informative, snappily edited listen, with Cooper interviewing celebrities and experts about relationships, sexual assault, trauma and mental health. Cooper \u201cagonised\u201d about interviewing Harris, she says, because she didn\u2019t want to alienate her Republican listeners, but \u201cmy goal today is not to change your political affiliation, what I\u2019m hoping is that you\u2019re able to listen to a conversation that isn\u2019t too different to the ones we\u2019re having here every week\u2026 on women\u2019s bodies and how we are treated and valued in this country\u201d. She\u2019s also asked Trump to come on the show. Still, judging by the social media comments, many of her listeners weren\u2019t convinced and have flounced in Trumpy disgust. To the UK ear, Call Her Daddy can be an abrasive listen. Cooper has that exaggerated reality show way of speaking, as though everything she says is highly significant. Plus, her questions to Harris really were softball at points: \u201cWhen people tell you no, when people look at you and doubt you, what does that ignite in you?\u201d Harris did well, though: engaging and warm, even a little slow and homely. \u201cI don\u2019t hear no,\u201d she said. Also, about when things go wrong: \u201cThink about where you had agency in that moment, don\u2019t let things just happen to you.\u201d From this interview, Harris needs to find a little more pizzazz, but she\u2019s definitely human. Here\u2019s another couple-chatting podcast, but with a twist. Boj &amp; Kate Have a Lot on Their Plate sees Maybe Baby couple, presenter Kate Lawler and her husband, Martin \u201cBoj\u201d Bojtos, have a niggly, funny discussion before keen cook Boj explains a dish that he\u2019s made for Kate and their toddler Noa (hence, no more of the couple\u2019s popular Maybe Baby shows: they had the baby). Topics included several fun stories about mad neighbours, weird chiropractors, doing strange things when you\u2019re asleep. I expected the cooking to be more upfront \u2013 chicken and leek pie, yum! \u2013 but that\u2019s perhaps because I listened around teatime, when I was hungry. (The recipes can be found on the @bojandkate Instagram feed.) This is Lawler\u2019s show, anyway: she\u2019s spiky and silly, nuttily charismatic. Maybe one episode could be Boj trying to get her to concentrate long enough to make a sandwich. Johnny Walker has announced he\u2019s leaving Radio 2 at the end of this month due to his pulmonary fibrosis, a dignified bowing out from an exceptional broadcasting career. It\u2019s interesting that his hosting duties will be taken over by Bob Harris (Sounds of the 70s) and Shaun Keaveny (The Rock Show). Keaveny was controversially let go by 6 Music in 2021, but battled on, putting out his own daily radio show-style podcasts until he was given a BBC Sounds podcast, Your Place or Mine, and now a Radio 2 show. In similar \u201coops\u201d news, Frank Skinner has started hosting a twice-weekly podcast, Frank Skinner Off the Radio (the first episode was on Friday). Skinner was recently dumped by Absolute Radio in unceremonious manner, after 15 years presenting his well-loved Saturday morning show. Both Skinner and Keaveny are hugely talented, idiosyncratic, personable broadcasters who are made for audio. Podcast or radio, thank God they\u2019re back.",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Andy Bull\u2019s report from the opening day in Barcelona. And with that, I\u2019ll wrap up this live blog of the action. Fear not: we shall have all the updates from day two and races three and four. Thanks very much for tuning in. Day one has belonged to Team New Zealand. What next in the America\u2019s Cup, then? Well, we do it all over again tomorrow at the same venue, on the same track, with two more races \u2013 weather permitting, of course. Monday is a reserve day. But all being well the third race day should be Wednesday. Theoretically, New Zealand could wrap the trophy up on Friday if they complete a clean sweep of races. 7-0 would be enough for them to retain the America\u2019s Cup. Ben Ainslie and GB will be hoping to take it all the way until the final race day, which is Monday 21 October. There\u2019s still time for things to swing back Britain\u2019s way. Here\u2019s that New Zealand reaction: Well, it\u2019s not been the ideal start for the British boats today. Hannah Mills and the Athena Pathway team were edged out in the inaugural Women\u2019s America\u2019s Cup, which was won by Italy. And Sir Ben Ainslie\u2019s crew on board Ineos Britannia have come up against sailing\u2019s answer to the All Blacks, Emirates Team New Zealand, who have just been a cut above so far, rarely making a mistake and seemingly having a bit more speed than the Brits. It\u2019s only day one, there\u2019s a potential 11 further races to come, but it\u2019s advantage New Zealand as it stands. \u201cAn awesome effort by the whole group,\u201d says New Zealand\u2019s Peter Burling. Time for his team to grab a deserved rest. Sir Ben Ainslie isn\u2019t too happy. \u201cCredit to the Kiwis for two really good races,\u201d he says. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t quite match them around the track but we\u2019re confident we can come back tomorrow and get some scores on the board.\u201d No huge histrionics from the Emirates Team New Zealand crew, but they should be mightily pleased with what they\u2019ve done today in Barcelona. A near-flawless performance in the opening two races to take firm control. Ineos Britannia haven\u2019t done much wrong but they\u2019ve been outdone here so far on the opening day of the America\u2019s Cup final. Leg 8: The British boat has closed the gap somewhat but it\u2019s not going to be enough. 2-0 New Zealand incoming. It\u2019s started to get away from the chasers, Ineos Britannia, now, with Rob Wilson admitting the Brits are \u201cwaiting for a slip-up\u201d from New Zealand. The defending champions have never really looked like making a mistake in the past couple of legs. Leg 8 to come. Leg 6: It\u2019s been a matter of metres and seconds separating the two yachts in this race, but New Zealand appear to be opening up a healthy gap now. They\u2019ve got the wind pressure, which can be vital. There\u2019s eight legs in this second race, by the way. At the halfway mark, it\u2019s still very close with Ineos Britannia cutting New Zealand\u2019s lead. Time for leg 5. Leg 4: 1-0 down will be a familiar scoreline for Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe given their football interests of late\u2026 but this is a performance in the second race so far that is full of character and perseverance \u2013 everything Manchester United are currently lacking. Sorry, I had to get at least one United reference in there. New Zealand hold a slender advantage. Leg 3: You cannot take your eyes off this race. It\u2019s a far more competitive, close and exciting affair than the one-sided opener. Team New Zealand suddenly find themselves in a contest. Leg 2: Ineos Britannia continues to look rapid downwind \u2013 the British team loves the wind in its sails, as the organisers slightly shorten the course for this second leg. It\u2019s still too close to call. It\u2019s absolutely neck-and-neck as the two teams cross paths \u2013 narrowly missing each other \u2013 a couple of times before they complete this first leg. Team New Zealand are just 30m in front. Eeesh. Leg 1: Team New Zealand slightly had the better of that pre-start exchange but the British team started quickly. \u201cSteady!\u201d is the shout from the Kiwis, who are 40m back at the moment. The battle for position at the start was a colossal one \u2013 and so fascinating to watch. With the wind picking up, the two high-octane AC75 boats found had some tacking to do, with Ineos Britannia looking pretty good at this stage, it must be said, trying to lock out the Kiwi boat at the start line. Leg 1 is go. Ben Ainslie was coy on the problems Ineos Britannia had at the outset of the first race. It was a battery issue, we know that. We also know how vital the start of each race is in the America\u2019s Cup. The race organisers have given the shout for both teams to set sail, quite literally, on the second race of a possible 13. Pre-start position may prove key. Right, we\u2019re not far off that second race now. The wind looks a lot healthier off the coast of Port Vell, Barcelona than it was earlier. The British team will have reflected on that opening defeat and will want to come out firing on all cylinders. We\u2019re now waiting for race two in the battle between Great Britain and New Zealand in the men\u2019s competition. I\u2019ll take a short break now until that race is nearly upon us. \u201cMassively well done to the Italian team,\u201d says GB\u2019s Hannah Mills. \u201cI\u2019m super proud of all the competitors. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long and amazing campaign, we\u2019ve put so much into this. Thanks to our friends at Ineos Britannia, too, who have helped us on this journey. I\u2019m so proud to be part of this first ever women\u2019s event.\u201d Congratulations to Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli. There are screams of delight on the Italian boat as they cross the line \u2013 they\u2019re the first ever female winners of the America\u2019s Cup. The British team just came up short in the end, eight seconds to be precise. This will hurt for them but they\u2019ve done themselves proud to reach the final. It\u2019s not been a great start for the British crews, in truth. Into the final leg. Remember this is a winner-takes-all final race \u2013 there will be no more opportunities. The first ever Women\u2019s America\u2019s Cup is coming to a conclusion. Italy are still in the ascendancy. The British yacht is gaining on the leaders, metre-by-metre. This is so, so tight. The gap is less than 100m as we prepare for the final two legs. We\u2019re into leg four of this Women\u2019s America\u2019s Cup final and Italy still have the advantage. Both crews are working hard under darkening skies in Barcelona. The Italians hold a very narrow lead at this stage, but the Athena Pathway, AKA British, team are not far away. This is much tighter than the opening race of the men\u2019s event, currently in the second of six legs. Women\u2019s Americas Cup: Britain and Italy contest the inaugural Women\u2019s America\u2019s Cup final today in Barcelona too, with Hannah Mills leading the Athena Pathway team. There\u2019s history all over the place today. We\u2019ll bring you reaction to that America\u2019s Cup first race and updates from the women\u2019s event. An advantage of 420 metres (and 41 seconds) amounts to a pretty stonking win for New Zealand in that opening race. They\u2019re a virtually unstoppable machine on the waves. Sir Ben Ainslie admitted Ineos Britannia didn\u2019t get a great start to the race but is full of praise for Emirates Team New Zealand. He says the British team will evaluate their performance and \u201ckeep pushing\u201d later today and in the races to come next week. New Zealand skipper Peter Burling: \u201cAlways a bit nervous sitting and waiting for the wind at the start, and it wasn\u2019t straightforward, but we managed to stay in control. Nathan Outteridge: \u201cIt was quite a dynamic race but it was good to get a clear start. Very happy to get the win in the first race. This is what we\u2019ve been working three years for.\u201d 1-0 to the defender. Emirates Team New Zealand started the stronger and never relinquished their lead, expertly holding off the challenger, the British yacht, as the wind changed significantly throughout that race. A really tough start for Ineos Britannia, who find themselves down early on. It is only the start, mind you. There\u2019s a lot more sailing to come. Final leg: The wind is dropping somewhat, with Britain struggling to tack in the dirty air. This looks to be done. Rob Wilson on the Ineos Britannia boat admits the British team \u201chad a few issues with the batteries\u201d [needed to work the foils] early on, which put them on the back foot immediately. He believes his team are '\u201cedging in there, but the Kiwis are making it tough \u2013 they\u2019ve got their elbows out and it\u2019s hard to get around them\u201d. The gap is now at around 350m. It\u2019s fascinating just to listen to the comms from both crews as they negotiate the wind and the seas in perfect harmony. We\u2019re into the final two legs of this opening race now, with New Zealand still holding a comfortable lead. Remember first to seven race wins will take home the America\u2019s Cup. Leg 4: The defenders are defending supremely, with New Zealand especially expert upwind, holding off the British boat. This race might be getting out of reach for Sir Ben Ainslie\u2019s team \u2013 unless they pull off something miraculous. Leg 3: The Team New Zealand boat is still riding well above the waves and the lead is extending again. It\u2019s up past the 300m mark. It\u2019s been a great second leg downwind for the British team as both teams manoeuvre and turn back upwind. Team New Zealand are still holding strong, mind. Into the third leg now. Leg 2: Ineos Britannia is picking up speed, taking a different route to Team New Zealand, whose lead is being cut slightly in the past few moments. Looks like the Brits are getting more wind pressure now. Leg 1: Team New Zealand have an advantage of around 100m, which they are holding, thanks to the breeze coming in from the left of both boats. It\u2019s out towards 200m now. The organisers are lengthening the course, which is a good sign re the wind, which is getting stronger all the time now. Let\u2019s go. \u201cThe wind is building,\u201d say the race organisers. The projected start time is now 1.50pm, UK time. This must be agony for the two teams, who are still primed and ready. It\u2019s a game of patience. A potential start time of 1.40pm has been pushed back a little further until 1.45pm as the wind limit hasn\u2019t been reached \u2013 it needs to average 6.5 knots. The fans\u2019 village in Barcelona is packed with Union Jacks; the British fans are out in force on this historic occasion. Gah, hopefully this doesn\u2019t take too long. British sailing fans have waited 60 years for the chance to compete for the America\u2019s Cup. Unfortunately the weather in Barcelona means that wait is going on a little longer right now. The British crew are \u201cfired up\u201d and keen to get racing, says Ineos coach Rob Wilson. It must be infuriating to just sit there in the boat waiting to get going. Team New Zealand say they are \u201coptimistic\u201d that we\u2019ll get some sailing today. Waiting for the breeze, eh. The wind is currently a little too light to start racing. Alas, that\u2019s the nature of sailing. Let\u2019s hope it picks up sufficiently. \u201cStarts are always key in match racing,\u201d Sir Ben tells Georgie Thompson on TNT Sports. \u201cWe expect the Kiwis to be feisty in the pre-start. Then it\u2019s about evaluating the performance of the two boats and it\u2019s the first to win seven. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a very proud sporting and maritime heritage in Britain and we want to right that wrong. At the same time, we don\u2019t want to switch anything up massively, we can go all the way. There\u2019s a lot of noise but many of us have been through similar situations in the past.\u201d Please do get in touch on email \u2013 as Jeremy Boyce has just done: \u201cHi Dom,\u201d he says. \u201cLooking forward to some great racing today on these new super-tech boats. I have a friend working on a big yacht who is there and she sent some great videos of the LV challenger series. It\u2019s incredible what technical advancement can achieve, in terms of speeds especially, but [Ben] Ainslie expressed it well in his interview saying that it had all become very push-button now, rather than hands on ropes. \u201cThe tech is very impressive, including the real-time tech support in-race, but the thing is, they\u2019re not really sail boats anymore, are they?\u201d Alas, no, Jeremy, I think foil boats and high-tech sailing are here to stay. As Jeremy adds: \u201cYou\u2019re not actually sitting on the water, navigating the contours, you\u2019re flying above it. And if you are actually on the water for a few seconds it may well cost you the race.\u201d A message from the main man: A slight adjustment to my earlier post: the first race will commence at 1.15pm BST, which is 2.15pm local time (CET) in Barcelona. The stage (sea) is set. It\u2019s only the 37th edition of the America\u2019s Cup, but you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a sporting trophy with a greater, richer history. The first ever competition in 1851 was won by the only American ship in the field, hence its swift name change. Some of these pictures are superb. Other than a little bit of rain in the air, conditions are looking good for sailing. Ben Ainslie: It\u2019s a really proud moment for us. We\u2019ve been going for 10 years to get ourselves into this final, so what an opportunity this is. We\u2019re going to give it everything we\u2019ve got. Why?. It speaks for itself doesn\u2019t it? Britain is a very proud sporting nation, and has a very proud maritime history, and this Cup is the one thing that\u2019s missing. That\u2019s why. The fact that Britain has never won the America\u2019s Cup is what drives us. Andy Bull reports from Barcelona. This part of Yara\u2019s explainer is particularly helpful to newcomers to the America\u2019s Cup: How does it work? Teams must first compete in a series of regattas, culminating in the Louis Vuitton Cup, which determines the main event\u2019s challenger. This year\u2019s matchup will see Team New Zealand as the defender take on Ineos Britannia after the Britons won the right to challenge New Zealand by beating Italy\u2019s Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli comfortably in the decisive race. The current format features a best of 13 series; the first to win seven races takes home the Cup. This year\u2019s edition begins with the first two races on 12 October. After that, the third and fourth races are set for 13 October. Subsequent races will occur on 16 October for the fifth and sixth races and on 18 October for the seventh. If necessary, the eighth race will be held on 18 October, the ninth and 10th on 19 October, the 11th and 12th on 20 October. The final race, if required, will take place on 21 October. Here we go: it\u2019s the oldest trophy in sport, it\u2019s a potential 13 races on the seas of Barcelona and it\u2019s a British team masterminded by Sir Ben Ainslie and Sir Jim Ratcliffe going up against the \u2018All Blacks of the Sea\u2019, defenders New Zealand. Can Ineos Britannia rule the waves against Team New Zealand, led Peter Burling, a two-time Cup winner and Olympic gold medallist? The first race gets under way at 1pm BST and the second will also take place in Port Vell, off the Barceloneta beachfront, this afternoon. We\u2019ve got 173 years of sporting history on the line in the coming days, with Great Britain looking to land their first ever America\u2019s Cup, competing in their first \u2018final\u2019 for 60 years. And if you\u2019re new to sailing and the competition, we\u2019ve got the best place for you to start:",

      "bodyText": "Match report: Suzanne Wrack reports from the Emirates Stadium, where a disastrous first half consigned Arsenal to defeat and some angry Gooners were seen waving mocked-up P45s in the direction of their beleaguered manager, Jonas Eidevall. \u201cFor sure it was a tough game and we were expecting that,\u201d says the Chelsea manager. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to win because three points are three points but I have to say I wish my team could have possessed more of the ball in the second half. \u201cI think we did well in the first one, not good enough in the second but it\u2019s part of the performance when your team is able to stay strong and not concede goals. As a mentality, I like that but I think with the quality of the players we have we should be able to produce more.\u201d \u201cWe knew it was going to be a tough game,\u201d says the Chelsea skipper in an interview with the BBC. \u201cIt\u2019s two top teams coming into battle. But as a team we\u2019ve got that fight and are still capable of creating chances at the end. \u201cThe style of play, we want to possess the ball and be brave. Coming to stadiums like these against top teams. We wanted to be brave and come away with three points.\u201d On the performance of Mayra Ramirez: \u201cShe\u2019s capable of carrying the ball, few defenders can take it off her. I witness that every day in training. She\u2019s extremely difficult to tackle and she gets us up the pitch especially against that low block.\u201d On Chelsea\u2019s winning mentality: \u201cIt\u2019s a part of who we are. As a new player you know what you have to do to get into the team and stay in the team. We have that monster mentality. It\u2019s become part of our environment.\u201d A quick recap: Chelsea scored from their first two shots on target, taking advantage of some disastrous Arsenal defending. The first goal came from a corner which Arsenal failed to clear, the ball bouncing kindly for the outstanding Mayra Ramirez, who hooked it over her own head and those of the oppositiuon defence, into the back of the net. The second was scored by Sandy Baltimore, the left-back taking advantage of some more charitable Arsenal defending to head home a cross from Lauren James. Arsenal pulled a goal back courtesy of a fine solo effort from their star player Caitlin Foord, but despite pinning Chelsea back for long periods of the second half, were unable to convert several chances to equalise. The pick of them fell to the substitute Stina Blackstenius, who could only hit the woodwork. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeeep! Referee Cheryl Foster draws proceedings at the Emirates to a close and Chelsea go top of the WSL, two points clear of Manchester City. Despite a much improved second half performance (it couldn\u2019t have been much worse than the first), Arsenal have come up short once again and find themselves in sixth place in the table with just five points from their opening four games. View the WSL table 90+6 min: Arsenal corner. Lucy Bronze heads the ball clear and Chelsea break upfield. The final whistle blows and despite their excellent second half performance, Arsenal have lost their second game in a row. They have just one win from their opening four WSL games this season. 90+4 min: Aggie Beever-Jones is played through in a one-on-one with Daphne Van Domselaar but blows her chance to put the game beyond Arsenal by shooting straight at their goalkeeper. 90+1 min: We\u2019re into six minutes of kitchen sink time for Arsenal and Erin Cuthbert has just been booked for something or other. Katie McCabe\u2019s free-kick is cleared as far as Russo, who\u2019s sweet shot on the volley is straight at Hannah Hampton. 88 min: Chelsea shore up their defensive ranks with a double-susbtitution: Nathalie Bjorn and Ashley Lawrence are on. 86 min: The Arsenal crowd appeal for a penalty when the ball appears to hit Millie Bright\u2019s raised arm in the Chelsea penalty area. Replays show it hit her in the face. 84min: Oof! McCabe picks out Blackstenius with a free-kick and the substitute\u2019s effort crashes against the crossbar. 82 min: It\u2019s largely the same personnel but this Arsenal side is completely unrecognisable from the absolute rabble that \u201ccontested\u201d the opening 35 minutes and are pressing hard for an equaliser. Time is against them, however. 80 min: Blackstenius has a shot blocked and then gets in the way of her Arsenal teammate Caitlin Foord\u2019s follow-up effort. 79 min: Blackstenius has an immediate impact, capitalising on a Kadeisha Buchanan error to advance down the inside left. She overhits her pass to Frida Maanum who had made an overlapping run and the ball runs out of play. 77 min: Arsenal double-substitution: Kyra Cooney-Cross and Stina Blackstenius on for Kim Little and Mariona Caldentey. Attendance watch: 45,860 souls, one of whom is former Chelsea manager and current USA boss, Emma Hayes. There\u2019s a break in play while Arsenal goalkeeper Daphne Van Domselaar receives treatment. 74 min: Chelsea substitution: Erin Cuthbert on for Wieke Kaftein. 73 min: Katie McCabe sends a corner into the Chelsea penalty area, where Lotte Wubben-Moy loses her marker Sjoeke Nusken and heads over. She should at the very least have hit the target. 70 min: It\u2019s worth noting that Beever-Jones looked conspicuously offside as that cross came in but the flag didn\u2019t go up. 68 min: Daphne Van Domselaar dives to her right to claw away a header from Aggie Beever-Jones, who had peeled away from Wubben-Moy and was unmarked on the edge of the six-yard box when she connected with a Guro Reiten cross from the left. Excellent goalkeeping. 65 min: Arsenal continue to knock on the door and win a corner, which is taken by Frida Maanum, who has just replaced Beth Mead. Nothing comes of it. 63 min: Chelsea double-substitution: Catarina Macario and Aggie Beever-Jones on for Mayra Ramirez and Lauren James. Arsenal\u2019s players won\u2019t be sorry to see the back of that duo, who have caused them all sorts of problems. 62 min: A Chelsea counter-attack breaks down when Mayra Ramirez barrels past several Arsenal players before being dispossessed by Kim Little. Ramirez is visibly limping. 57 min: A Sjoeke Nusken cross into the path of Lauren James is intercepted my Lotte Wubben-Moy, who is immediately muscled off the ball by the Chelsea winger. James advances towards goal and is tackled by Wubben-Moy, who is eager to atone for her error. There are calls for a penalty but it looked a good, clean tackle to me. Crucially, James was not one of the Chelsea players appealing for a spot-kick. 54 min: From a Chelsea throw-in deep inside their own half, the ball goes straight to Katie McCabe, who immediately swings it into the opposition penalty area. It\u2019s cleared. Moments later, another promising Arsenal attack breaks down when Alessio Russo has a shot blocked by Millie Bright. While the bar is extremely low, this is much, much better from Arsenal. 53 min: Caitlin Foord, Arsenal\u2019s goalscorer, is booked for a bodycheck on Lucy Bronze. 51 min: Katie McCabe curls a free-kick from wide on the right through the Chelsea penalty area and wide. Lotte Wubben-Moy was unable to get the crucial touch despite stretching every sinew. It\u2019s raining heavily at the Emirates. 50 min: Emily Fox tries a speculative shot from outside the Chelsea penalty area but it\u2019s blocked by Wieke Kaftein. 48 min: There\u2019s a break in play so Mayra Ramirez can receive treatment for some manner of injury. She\u2019s been outstanding in this match and Arsenal\u2019s players would love to see her go off. She\u2019s fit continue for now. 47 min: Mayra Ramirez outmuscles two Arsenal defenders and glides past another before picking out Johanna Kaneryd on the right side of the penalty area. She gets a shot away but it\u2019s low, weak and straight at Arsenal goalkeeper Daphne Van Domselaar. 46 min: Play resumes with Arsenal on the ball and no changes in personnel on either side. A massive, potentially season-defining 45 minutes looms for Jonas Eidevall and his team. Lord Herman Ouseley: While the Premier League and English Football League did the square root of nothing whatsoever to mark the passing of the anti-discrimination campaigner and founder of Kick It Out last weekend, it\u2019s worth noting that the players of both teams on the pitch this afternoon are wearing black armbands in tribute to the great man. May he rest in peace. More correspondence: \u201cIt\u2019s a particular sadness for Arsenal fans to see Beth Mead operating at what: 50 or 60% of how incisive she used to be,\u201d writes Charles Antaki. \u201cSince coming back from her injury she\u2019s been barely recognisable. The team as a whole has lacked precision, confidence and drive; but it hurts more when when a fan favourite starts to fade.\u201d An email: \u201cFoord deserved that,\u201d writes Ian Porter. \u201cBy far Arsenal\u2019s greatest threat. Wondering whether sentiment should be put aside and the invisible Kim Little removed at half time.\u201d On the subject of putting sentiment aside, Leah Williamson has had a nightmare first half for Arsenal and been given the total runaround by Mayra Ramirez. In fairness to Williamson, she\u2019s not long back from injury and probably not totally match fit, but as she\u2019s on a yellow card it would be no great surprise to see her benched for the second half. Peep! Referee Cheryl Foster signals for the break and Arsenal go in for their half-time brew just a goal down despite some catatrophically bad defending that allowed Mayra Ramirez and Sandy Baltimore to give Chelsea what looked like an unassailable lead. In the final 10 minutes of the half, however, Arsenal gradually grew into the game and an opportunistic strike from Caitlin Foord has given them a lifeline. 45+1 min: That goal has woken up an Emirates crowd who had previously been sitting in seething silence at the sight of their team put in a shift during the first 30 minutes that was so bad it genuinely beggared belief. If they can get into the dressing-room at half-time just one goal behind, they\u2019ll be delighted. The whistle goes for the break and we have a game on our hands. Arsenal pull a goal back! It\u2019s been coming and Caitlin Foord scores with a wonderful individual effort. With the ball at her feet on the byline, she somehow skips past Lucy Bronze, steps out to create an angle for herself and instead of shooting for the near post, curls a right-footed effort around Hannah Hampton and inside the far post. That\u2019s a fantastic goal. 41 min: Another Arsenal corner, as Kadeisha Buchanan denies Beth Mead with a block-tackle. McCabe\u2019s delivery into the six-yard box is headed clear. 39 min: Another chance for Arsenal goes to waste, as Millie Bright clears an Alessia Russo shot off the line. 37 min: The inswinger from McCabe is terrific and drops perfectly for Leah Williamson at the far post. With the goal gaping, she barely makes contact with the ball and skims it wide, possibly put off by her fellow defender Lotte Wubben-Moy, who was also shaping to try and prod it home. That was a glorious opportunity for Arsenal to pull a goal back 35 min: Emily Fox wins a corner for Arsenal, her attempted cross from the right put out of play by Millie Bright. 33 min: Leah Williamson is booked for a foul on Mayra Ramirez. She\u2019s bang to rights but that doesn\u2019t stop her arguing her case with Cheryl Foster, the match referee. 31 min: Chelsea embark on another sortie into the Arsenal half but on this occasion, Mayra Ramirez, who is terrorising the hosts with her marauding runs and clever passes, is dispossessed. Arsenal launch a counter-attack but it breaks down when Beth Mead\u2019s pass to Russo goes awry. 29 min: Katie McCabe plays a kamikaze pass across the face of her own penalty area, putting Leah Williamson in all sorts of trouble under a heavy press from Guro Reiten. The Chelsea player\u2019s cross back into the penalty area fails to pick out a teammate and Arsenal get away with the latest in an apparently neverending series of defensive blunders. 27 min: With Caitlin Foord back defending, Lauren James tries to cut inside but has to settle for a throw-in deep in Arsenal territory, down by the corner flag. Nothing comes of it. 26 min: Lauren James sends a free-kick towards the edge of the Arsenal box but the home side clear it. 24 min: The aforementioned corner came from a deflected Caitlin Foord shot that fizzed over the bar. Arsenal aren\u2019t completely out of this game yet but really need to score the next goal. 22 min: Chelsea goalkeeper Hannah Hampton completely misjudges the trajectory of a Beth Mead corner and the ball sails over her head. Kadeisha Buchanan is alert and on hand to head the ball clear before anyone in a red shirt can steer it home. 21 min: Arsenal try to regroup and Caitlin Foord sends a low cross into the Chelsea penalty area towards Russo. She\u2019s disposssed by Buchanana, who clears for Chelsea. 18 min: Arsenal\u2019s defending \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 was comically awful for that goal. Lauren James was given the freedom of the right wing to cut inside, skip past Emily Fox and ping a cross towards Baltimore, who was completely unmarked and had all the time in the world to stoop, pick her spot and head past Arsenal\u2019s hopelessly exposed goalkeeper. Chelsea double their lead! This is a disaster for Arsenal! Completely unmarked at the far post, Sandy Baltimore stoops to head the ball past Van Domselaar, converting a cross from Lauren James. 16 min: The ball\u2019s played wide to Chelsea left-back Sandy Baltimore near the halfway line but she\u2019s unable to keep it in play. 13 min: Not yet, is the answer to that question. Millie Bright clears the inswinger with a meaty header. 12 min: Arsenal win a corner after decent work down the left from Katie McCabe and Caitlin Foord. Let\u2019s see if they\u2019re any better at taking corners than they are at defending them. 10 min: Millie Bright is very lucky to avoid a booking for fouling Alessio Russo as the Chelsea striker tried to break upfield on the counter-attack after Arsenal had defended a long throw deep inside their own half. 8 min: Moments before that opener, Arsenal went close when Beth Mead headed over the bar after capitalising on a slapstick mix-up between Chelsea central defenders Millie Bright and Kadeisha Buchanan. 6 min: That was a strange goal. Chelsea had a corner, which was only half-cleared towards Ramirez, the ball bouncing in front of her as she stood with her back to goal. Without trying to turn, she simply hooked it over her own head and Arsenal\u2019s defenders seemed paralysed as the ball dropped over Van Domselaar and into the goal. Chelsea lead! With her back to goal, Mayra Ramirez scores with an opportunisitc scoop over her own head that catches Arsenal goalkeeper Daphne Van Domselaar slightly off her line and drops into the back of the net. What a goal! 1 min: Guro Reiten sprints between Arsenal central defenders Leah Williamson and Lotte Wubben-Moy, running on to a ball from deep. She\u2019s offside. 1 min: Chelsea get the ball rolling at their second attempt, the first kick-off coming somewhat prematurely as a couple of over-zealous players forgot the referee\u2019s openong whistle was a signal for them to take a pre-match knee. Not long now: Both sets of players march out on to the Emirates pitch and line up either side of referee Cheryl Foster and her team of match officials. The last of the pre-match formalities are underway and there are just a couple of minutes to go until kick-off. Attendance watch: In a state of affairs that suggests the WSL is in fairly rude health, Arsenal have sold over 40,000 tickets for this match, which is also being broadcast live on BBC One television. An email: \u201cA curtain-raiser for the weekend\u2019s WSL games, indeed; but also a potential curtain-closer on Arsenal\u2019s leage prospects,\u201d writes Charles Antaki. \u201cThe fact that things have spectacularly not gone their way in their opening matches so far \u2013 a dismal failure to score against the leagues bottom club, and a sound rubbing by Bayern Munich \u2013 is a source of some anguish to Arsenal fans. \u201cIt\u2019s worse because there\u2019s no one obvious cause: you can\u2019t blame it all on the loss of Vivianne Miedema. Increasingly it\u2019s the manager who\u2019s edging into the crosshairs. Good luck with this one, Jonas.\u201d Girls on Film: Viewing figures for Women\u2019s Super League games streamed online have more than trebled this season following the switch to YouTube as the division\u2019s streaming platform. Tom Garry reports \u2026 Arsenal: A heavy defeat to Bayern Munich has done little to quell growing discontent at the club ahead of today\u2019s visit of the WSL champions, writes Suzanne Wrack. Those teams: Sonia Bompastor makes two changes to the side that beat Real Madrid in midweek. Goalkeeper Hannah Hampton comes in for Zecira Muskovic, who drops to the bench. Centre-back Kadeisha Buchanan replaces Nathalie Bjorn, who is also among the subs. Arsenal boss Jonas Eidevall makes four changes to the side that started against Bayern Munich. Daphne Van Donselaar, Alessia Russo, Lotte Wubben-Moye and Beth Mead come into the side, with Manuela Zinsberger, Laia Codina, Frida Maanum and Stina Blackstenius missing out.

Women\u2019s Football Weekly Faye Carruthers is in the hotseat as Suzanne Wrack, Tom Garry and Sophie Downey discuss the latest goings-on in the women\u2019s game. Listen to our podcast here and if you\u2019re not already a subscriber, you can sign up for free on all the usual platforms. Early Chelsea team news Sophie Ingle, Aniek Nouwen, Sam Kerr and Mia Fishel are all out with ACL injuries, while Niamh Charles continues her recovery from a surgery on a shoulder injury. Goalkeeper Hannah Hampson and American international Catarina Macario could return after missing the midweek win over Real Madrid through illness, while midfielder Erin Cuthbert also sat that game out with a knock but could return this afternoon. Early Arsenal team news Arsenal\u2019s Swedish defender Amanda Ilestedt is unavailable for selection as she is expecting her first child, while her compatriot Lina Hurtig also remains out. The team\u2019s Austrian right-back Laura Wienroither is also sidelined with an injury she picked up in her team\u2019s 1-0 win over Leicester, while Arsenal\u2019s Dutch defender Victoria Pelova is out for the foreseeable future after rupturing her ACL while on international duty during the summer. In better news for the Gunners, skipper Leah Williamson is expected to make her first league start of the season after playing the full 90 minutes against Bayern Munich in midweek. Arsenal welcome Chelsea to the Emirates Stadium for this weekend\u2019s WSL curtain-raiser, with the visitors hoping to maintain their 100% start to the season. They sit second in the table with two wins from two and beat Real Madrid in the Champions League in midweek, albeit courtesy of a performance that drew criticism from their French manager, Sonia Bompastor. Arsenal\u2019s start to the season has been comparatively underwhelming, with a scoreless league draw against Everton coming ahead of a 5-2 European pummelling at the hands of Bayern Munich at the FC Bayern Campus. Kick-off in North London is at 1.45pm (BST) but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.",

Four games into the season, Arsenal have one win and already sit four points behind the champions, Chelsea, who have a game in hand.</p> <p>Meanwhile, they suffered a bruising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/09/bayern-munich-arsenal-womens-champions-league-match-report\">5-2 defeat by Bayern Munich</a> in the Champions League after leading in midweek, off the back of a poor 0-0 draw with Everton. The loss of Vivianne Miedema to rivals Manchester City also hangs a dark cloud over the club.</p> <p>For a team wanting to challenge for titles, this is all being viewed as just not good enough, a mock P45 at the match circulating <a href=\"https://x.com/mybadwosotakes/status/1845084438733939001?s=46\">among fans on social media</a>.</p> <p>Eidevall urged supporters to take heart from the players\u2019 fighting spirit. \u201cThey should see the players and how incredibly hard they work. How much heart they have, how much character they have for the club. That, I hope, gives supporters belief,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Arsenal can be buoyed somewhat by their second-half performance, the players roared on by the anxious majority of the 45,860 fans present. But the damage had already been done, a lacklustre and chaotic start acting as a microcosm of their season so far.</p> <p>Eidevall has repeated the line \u201cpressure is not just a privilege, it\u2019s a necessity\u201d throughout the start of the new campaign but this kind of pressure is neither. Arsenal are on the back foot and then some, every game a cup final now as they limp forwards, buying time.</p>    <p>An unemployed Casey Stoney was sat in the stands with her family, a reminder of the quality on offer should the club\u2019s hierarchy decide Eidevall\u2019s time is up.</p> <p>The Swede had spent a good portion of his pre-match interview with the BBC talking about the work they had been doing on defending set pieces, aware of the threat posed by Chelsea in this area. It was somewhat brutally ironic then that the visitors took the lead within four minutes via a corner, Mayra Ram\u00edrez, with her back to goal, scooping the ball over her head; it looped down and softly in.</p> <p>Ram\u00edrez, swept away in celebration, stopped to face the Arsenal fans, arms crossed, head nodding while Sjoeke N\u00fcsken slid between her legs to pose on her stomach with her face in her hands.</p> <p>It was a celebration full of the swagger that mirrored Chelsea\u2019s first-half performance. Their second goal was similarly impressive, Lauren James swinging away from the byline to send a cross to the back post where an unmarked Sandy Baltimore headed in.</p> <p>The home team pulled one back before the break, Caitlin Foord mirroring a move she had made earlier in the half when having an effort deflected over. She wriggled past Lucy Bronze at the byline before curving the ball past Hannah Hampton and into the far corner from the tightest of angles.</p> <p>Arsenal looked a much more coherent side in the second half, but the bar had been set low. The arrivals of Frida Maanum then Stina Blackstenius had an immediate impact, and Blackstenius hit the bar with five minutes of normal time remaining.</p> <p>This was Chelsea\u2019s game to lose though, the Blues happy to bank back against a team that has struggled to break down low blocks and would accrue only three shots on target among 20. What next for Eidevall and Arsenal? They host the Norwegian side V\u00e5lerenga back at the Emirates on Wednesday. There is not much of an opportunity for introspection, but they need to make the time.</p>",

Four games into the season, Arsenal have one win and already sit four points behind the champions, Chelsea, who have a game in hand. Meanwhile, they suffered a bruising 5-2 defeat by Bayern Munich in the Champions League after leading in midweek, off the back of a poor 0-0 draw with Everton. The loss of Vivianne Miedema to rivals Manchester City also hangs a dark cloud over the club. For a team wanting to challenge for titles, this is all being viewed as just not good enough, a mock P45 at the match circulating among fans on social media. Eidevall urged supporters to take heart from the players\u2019 fighting spirit. \u201cThey should see the players and how incredibly hard they work. How much heart they have, how much character they have for the club. That, I hope, gives supporters belief,\u201d he said. Arsenal can be buoyed somewhat by their second-half performance, the players roared on by the anxious majority of the 45,860 fans present. But the damage had already been done, a lacklustre and chaotic start acting as a microcosm of their season so far. Eidevall has repeated the line \u201cpressure is not just a privilege, it\u2019s a necessity\u201d throughout the start of the new campaign but this kind of pressure is neither. Arsenal are on the back foot and then some, every game a cup final now as they limp forwards, buying time. An unemployed Casey Stoney was sat in the stands with her family, a reminder of the quality on offer should the club\u2019s hierarchy decide Eidevall\u2019s time is up. The Swede had spent a good portion of his pre-match interview with the BBC talking about the work they had been doing on defending set pieces, aware of the threat posed by Chelsea in this area. It was somewhat brutally ironic then that the visitors took the lead within four minutes via a corner, Mayra Ram\u00edrez, with her back to goal, scooping the ball over her head; it looped down and softly in. Ram\u00edrez, swept away in celebration, stopped to face the Arsenal fans, arms crossed, head nodding while Sjoeke N\u00fcsken slid between her legs to pose on her stomach with her face in her hands. It was a celebration full of the swagger that mirrored Chelsea\u2019s first-half performance. Their second goal was similarly impressive, Lauren James swinging away from the byline to send a cross to the back post where an unmarked Sandy Baltimore headed in. The home team pulled one back before the break, Caitlin Foord mirroring a move she had made earlier in the half when having an effort deflected over. She wriggled past Lucy Bronze at the byline before curving the ball past Hannah Hampton and into the far corner from the tightest of angles. Arsenal looked a much more coherent side in the second half, but the bar had been set low. The arrivals of Frida Maanum then Stina Blackstenius had an immediate impact, and Blackstenius hit the bar with five minutes of normal time remaining. This was Chelsea\u2019s game to lose though, the Blues happy to bank back against a team that has struggled to break down low blocks and would accrue only three shots on target among 20. What next for Eidevall and Arsenal? They host the Norwegian side V\u00e5lerenga back at the Emirates on Wednesday. There is not much of an opportunity for introspection, but they need to make the time.",

But Mario Ajello, a journalist and political commentator for the newspaper Il Messaggero, believes it is because Berlinguer was recognised as being a \u201cmorally impeccable\u201d leader capable of uniting opposing forces. \u201cThere is also some nostalgia today for the old parties and when they functioned well, and when Italy functioned,\u201d he said. \u201cBerlinguer was a guarantor, not only of his party\u2019s interest, but for the general interest.\u201d He added: \u201cAs for the far right, they do it to show they have overcome ideological barriers \u2013 because if you were a great Italian, even if you were a communist, they can appreciate you.\u201d Meloni was also invited by Rome\u2019s centre-left mayor, Roberto Gualtieri, to the opening ceremony of the Rome film festival on 16 October. \u201cThis is normal, and a correct institutional relationship should never be lacking,\u201d he said, adding that despite their political differences, he has \u201ca good personal relationship\u201d with Meloni. \u2022 Berlinguer: The Great Ambition is in Italian cinemas from 31 October and will later be released internationally.",

In Arizona, the debate is deadly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In brief introductory remarks, Gallego shared his insights after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/23/ruben-gallego-arizona-senate-kyrsten-sinema-democrat\">nearly two years of campaigning </a>across the Grand Canyon state.

At a gas station in south Phoenix, Gallego said he had noticed motorists weren\u2019t filling up their tanks all the way. He recalled his family\u2019s own financial struggles growing up, raised alongside his three sisters by a single, immigrant mother in a cramped apartment outside of Chicago.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of thing that I want to bring to the US Senate: a real understanding of what people are dealing with and what we should be doing to make their life a little better,\u201d he said, \u201cto just breathe a little bit easier and have a chance at the American Dream.\u201d</p> <p>Across town, his opponent, the former TV news anchor Lake channeled Trump, whom she has molded herself after since her foray into politics two years ago. She had called an \u201cemergency\u201d press conference to discuss Kamala Harris\u2019s visit to the Arizona-Mexico border the previous day, tying Gallego \u2013<strong> </strong>who did not accompany the vice-president<strong> </strong>\u2013 to what she described as the administration\u2019s \u201cabject failure\u201d on border security.</p> <p>She scolded the media for not doing more to hold Gallego responsible for migration, which has fallen sharply after reaching record highs last year. She <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/03/ruben-gallego-calls-kari-lake-pathetic-mentioning-fathers-criminal-history/75501994007/\">accused</a> Gallego of being \u201ccontrolled\u201d by the drug cartels because of his long-estranged father\u2019s criminal history.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to be calling out what he is about,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to end the cartels.\u201d</p> <p>The dueling campaign events underscored the very different paths the two candidates are charting as they vie to succeed Senator Kyrsten Sinema, the Democrat turned independent leaving the chamber.</p> <p>As early voting begins in Arizona,<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://elections2024.thehill.com/arizona/arizona-senate-gallego-lake/\">polling</a><strong> </strong>shows Gallego with a consistent edge in a contest that could be pivotal to determining which party controls the Senate. The Democrat is trouncing Lake in fundraising, giving him more local airtime and mailbox presence. And surveys and interviews suggest he is winning a sizable, perhaps decisive, chunk of Trump voters.</p>    <p>Lake has alienated some conservatives and independents with her attacks on the Republican establishment and her embrace of election denialism, including in her own failed bid for governor in 2022, which she claims \u2013 baselessly \u2013 was stolen.</p> <p>But it isn\u2019t over yet: Lake delivered a polished performance during Wednesday night\u2019s debate with Gallego, and could pull out more attacks on her opponent in the final stretch - including his divorce records from his split with the Phoenix mayor, Kate Gallego, which may be unsealed this month. After the debate, she got a boost from the only Republican who seems to matter.</p> <p>\u201cThe Trump-endorsed Senate Candidate in Arizona crushed her Liberal Democrat Opponent,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social <a href=\"https://x.com/KariLake/status/1844427047277318360\">after the debate</a>. \u201cKari will help me Secure our Border, Stop Inflation, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201d</p> <p>But Trump,<strong> </strong>who lost Arizona in 2020 by less than 11,000 votes, is able to stitch together a coalition of loyalists and independents that even his most adherent Maga acolytes \u2013 and Lake is one of them \u2013 can\u2019t always replicate. Paul Bentz, a pollster at Arizona public affairs firm HighGround, ran a recent poll that showed the presidential race essentially deadlocked. But in the Senate contest, Gallego led Lake 51% to 41%.</p> <p>The survey showed both Trump and Lake losing more Republican voters than Harris or Gallego are among Democrats, but Trump is losing fewer of them \u2013 and Trump is ahead of Harris with independents, unlike Lake, who lags Gallego with the group.</p> <p>Billboards financed by the Arizona Republican party that boast of \u201c<a href=\"https://x.com/AZGOP/status/1836770222415720942\">team unity</a>\u201d don\u2019t include Lake - instead, Trump is alongside out-of-staters like JD Vance, Elon Musk, Robert F Kennedy, Vivek Ramaswamy and Tulsi Gabbard. Lake\u2019s <a href=\"https://x.com/KariLakeWarRoom/status/1842732298715713545\">campaign bus</a>, on the other hand, is wrapped in a photo of her and Trump. \u201cEndorsed by President Trump\u201d is written in larger font than Lake\u2019s own name.</p> <p>\u201cThe vast majority of the money and the vast majority of the effort is in supporting Trump,\u201d Bentz said. \u201cIt does not seem to be following the rubric that we\u2019ve seen in past elections to help the down ticket that\u2019s building a slate of support.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not vote Republican, it\u2019s vote Trump.\u201d</p> <p>Even so, Lake supporters are hoping the polling numbers - which Lake herself has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJ4mlhzMGNg\">said</a> differ from what she\u2019s seeing internally - won\u2019t bear out. A Republican operative involved in the effort to elect conservative candidates in the state said high turnout in a presidential election year with Trump at the top of the ticket could bring Lake over the line.</p> <p>Lake did not respond to a request for an interview, and Gallego was not made available for an interview.</p> <h2>Building a coalition</h2> <p>Years of political upheaval \u2013 Arizona has had six senators in just over a decade \u2013 and the Republican party\u2019s Trumpian turn, has created an opening for Democrats in the land of Barry Goldwater and John McCain. Waves of new residents, many coming from more liberal parts of the country, and a suburban shift away from Republicans, has changed Arizona\u2019s political landscape. </p> <p>If Gallego wins in November, he will be the first <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/senators/hispanic-american-senators.htm\">Latino</a> to represent Arizona in the Senate while Lake would be the first Republican woman elected to serve the state in the chamber.</p> <p>Gallego announced his campaign for Senate in early 2023, effectively daring Sinema to stay in the race after infuriating Democrats by blocking pieces of Joe Biden\u2019s agenda. Without a primary opponent, he had ample time to introduce himself to voters across the vast state, from the tribal lands to the borderlands and the populous Maricopa county.</p> <p>He has a compelling personal story, repeated in television ads that have been airing for months: the son of a Mexican and Colombian immigrant, who was raised by his mother and worked odd jobs at meat-packing plants and pizza shops to earn extra money for his family.</p> <p>A Harvard graduate, he enrolled in the Marine Corps, and was deployed to Iraq as part of a unit that saw some of the heaviest casualties of the war. On the trail, he often recalls how combat training kicked in on January 6, when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol. Photos from the day showed Gallego directing his colleagues how to put on gas masks and helping them evacuate the chamber.</p> <p>By contrast, Bentz said Lake hasn\u2019t spent much time trying to reintroduce herself to voters, perhaps confident that they know her from TV or from her 2022 bid. For more than a year following her defeat, Lake was in the news for her fruitless attempts to overturn the results. She was sued for defamation by the Republican election official, after he claimed she upended his life with her false accusations that he rigged the election against her. She ultimately declined to defend her statements in the case.</p> <p>During the debate, Lake repeatedly accused Gallego of undergoing an \u201cextreme makeover\u201d to blot out his progressive record in the House and cultivate a more moderate appeal. But Lake has struggled to paint Gallego as too far left.</p> <p>The Congressman has tacked more toward the ideological center in the past year, particularly on immigration. In a state where activists remember him marching for immigrant rights after a Republican-led crackdown on undocumented workers, he is now touting his support for a border security bill that would limit asylum and provide more resources to hire border agents.</p> <p>Becky Wyatt, who hosted Gallego at Fuse Flex Space, the co-working space she just opened weeks before, called the choice in November a \u201cno-brainer\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s just such a character flaw difference between the two Senate candidates,\u201d Wyatt said.</p> <p>This year, Lake has attempted<strong> </strong>to mend fences. The state\u2019s former Republican governor, Doug Ducey, set aside their feud and endorsed her bid for Senate earlier this summer. Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, a hardline conservative seeking to replace Mitch McConnell as party leader, appeared as her surrogate after the debate.</p> <p>But her harsh words toward <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/opinions/kari-lake-mccain-arizona-republicans-gabriel/index.html\">McCain Republicans</a> still linger. During her campaign for governor, she told this subset of Republicans to \u201cget the hell out\u201d and claimed she \u201cdrove a stake through the heart of the McCain machine\u201d.</p> <p>Gibson McKay, a Republican lobbyist, was an aide to McCain. He donated thousands of dollars to Lake\u2019s gubernatorial campaign, but her comments on his former boss soured him. He\u2019s now one of the Trump-Gallego crossover voters who would be needed for both the former president and Democratic congressman to win the state.</p>    <p>\u201cJohn McCain was my friend. She can play that game with her Turning Point friends, and she\u2019ll never have my support because of that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s mean, it\u2019s ugly, and it\u2019s what\u2019s tearing down on the fabric of American politics.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s friends \u2013 \u201ca friend friend, not like a political friend\u201d \u2013 with Gallego and his name was on a fundraiser for the congressman this year. A conservative, he aligns more with Lake on policy, but a few factors, including his personal friendship with Gallego, played into his decision to back the Democrat this cycle. He also believes Gallego is more authentic than Lake, just as he believes Trump is more authentic than Harris.</p> <p>McKay\u2019s support for Gallego hasn\u2019t gone over well with some of his Republican friends. McKay is an elected precinct committeeman, the foot-soldiers of political activism. Republicans in his legislative district <a href=\"https://x.com/jeremiahcota/status/1838789937002402040\">censured</a> him for supporting the Democrat, and there was an effort afoot to try to remove his duties in his elected role.</p> <p>McKay says he hasn\u2019t seen evidence Lake is trying to make peace, and it wouldn\u2019t ring true if she tried it. Earlier this year, McCain\u2019s daughter, Meghan McCain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/21/meghan-mccain-kari-lake-arizona-republicans\">rejected</a> the idea, saying: \u201cNo peace, bitch. We see you for who you are \u2013 and are repulsed by it.\u201d</p> <h2>Debate gives Lake a boost</h2> <p>On Wednesday, Lake and Gallego met on stage for their only televised debate this cycle. From the jump, Lake, comfortable in front of the camera after decades anchoring the television news, attacked Gallego over immigration, her strongest issue.</p> <p>She claimed a red-eye flight out of Phoenix\u2019s airport \u201clooks like a migrant encampment\u201d because migrants first come to Arizona before shipping out elsewhere.</p> <p>Gallego, stiff and sticking to talking points, pushed Lake on abortion and her shifting positions. (She had previously expressed support for Arizona\u2019s pre-statehood abortion ban before the Supreme Court upheld the law, sparking a massive backlash. She backed the state GOP\u2019s effort to repeal the law and reinstate a 15-week ban. Gallego has said he would support a federal law restoring Roe, which protects abortion until the point of fetal viability, roughly about 22 weeks of pregnancy.)</p> <p>The two issues typically top lists of importance for voters in Arizona, which shares a border with Mexico. An abortion ballot measure to increase access to the procedure beyond the current 15-week ban is also before voters in November, probably buoying turnout and expected to pass easily.</p> <p>Lake stumbled a bit on her reproductive health care responses, erroneously calling in-vitro fertilization \u201cUVF\u201d \u2013<strong> </strong>it is abbreviated IVF<strong> </strong><strong>\u2013</strong> while repeatedly pointing out she was a woman who had many women in her family and attempting to pivot.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m astounded that he actually knows the difference between a woman and a man,\u201d she cracked at one point, \u201cbecause I thought there were, what, 147 different genders. I do care about women\u2019s rights.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/10/maryland-senate-seat-larry-hogan-angela-alsobrooks\">Can ex-governor\u2019s anti-Trump stance swing key Senate seat for Republicans?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lake also made it personal: she called Gallego a sexual harasser and brought up family ties to drug cartels, a charge Gallego ignored. He previously grew emotional while addressing the claims in a press conference, saying he\u2019d worked his entire life to get away from his father\u2019s misdeeds. </p> <p>Gallego repeatedly raised Lake\u2019s refusal to accept her defeat in the 2022 race for Arizona governor. He called her dangerous, noting how her election lies led one election official to need private security because of increased threats.</p> <p>The debate ended with Gallego sharing his personal story, his biggest asset on the campaign trail. \u201cI\u2019m a very lucky man,\u201d he said to the camera in a closing statement. \u201cI\u2019m just lucky to be born in the best country in this world. And by all counts, I shouldn\u2019t even be here. My mom raised us alone, and with a real belief in the American dream, and a real want to succeed, I got to where I am.\u201d</p> <p>Given the final word, Lake promised that as a senator she would usher in a \u201cstrong, secure border\u201d and \u201cstrong Trump economy\u201d. Then she echoed her opponent.</p> <p>\u201cIf there\u2019s any kiddos watching, I don\u2019t want you to worry,\u201d Lake concluded. \u201cI want you to dream really big. I want you to know that we\u2019re going to turn this country around, and your American dream will become reality.\u201d</p>",

The diverse attendance was one sign of what polls, strategists, Democrats and even some Republicans acknowledge: the race for an open Senate seat is the 44-year-old Democrat\u2019s to lose, a surprising position for a progressive congressman in a purple state running against Trump-endorsed firebrand Kari Lake. In brief introductory remarks, Gallego shared his insights after nearly two years of campaigning across the Grand Canyon state.

Building a coalition Years of political upheaval \u2013 Arizona has had six senators in just over a decade \u2013 and the Republican party\u2019s Trumpian turn, has created an opening for Democrats in the land of Barry Goldwater and John McCain. Waves of new residents, many coming from more liberal parts of the country, and a suburban shift away from Republicans, has changed Arizona\u2019s political landscape. If Gallego wins in November, he will be the first Latino to represent Arizona in the Senate while Lake would be the first Republican woman elected to serve the state in the chamber. Gallego announced his campaign for Senate in early 2023, effectively daring Sinema to stay in the race after infuriating Democrats by blocking pieces of Joe Biden\u2019s agenda. Without a primary opponent, he had ample time to introduce himself to voters across the vast state, from the tribal lands to the borderlands and the populous Maricopa county. He has a compelling personal story, repeated in television ads that have been airing for months: the son of a Mexican and Colombian immigrant, who was raised by his mother and worked odd jobs at meat-packing plants and pizza shops to earn extra money for his family. A Harvard graduate, he enrolled in the Marine Corps, and was deployed to Iraq as part of a unit that saw some of the heaviest casualties of the war. On the trail, he often recalls how combat training kicked in on January 6, when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol. Photos from the day showed Gallego directing his colleagues how to put on gas masks and helping them evacuate the chamber. By contrast, Bentz said Lake hasn\u2019t spent much time trying to reintroduce herself to voters, perhaps confident that they know her from TV or from her 2022 bid.

She was sued for defamation by the Republican election official, after he claimed she upended his life with her false accusations that he rigged the election against her. She ultimately declined to defend her statements in the case. During the debate, Lake repeatedly accused Gallego of undergoing an \u201cextreme makeover\u201d to blot out his progressive record in the House and cultivate a more moderate appeal. But Lake has struggled to paint Gallego as too far left. The Congressman has tacked more toward the ideological center in the past year, particularly on immigration. In a state where activists remember him marching for immigrant rights after a Republican-led crackdown on undocumented workers, he is now touting his support for a border security bill that would limit asylum and provide more resources to hire border agents. Becky Wyatt, who hosted Gallego at Fuse Flex Space, the co-working space she just opened weeks before, called the choice in November a \u201cno-brainer\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s just such a character flaw difference between the two Senate candidates,\u201d Wyatt said. This year, Lake has attempted to mend fences. The state\u2019s former Republican governor, Doug Ducey, set aside their feud and endorsed her bid for Senate earlier this summer. Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, a hardline conservative seeking to replace Mitch McConnell as party leader, appeared as her surrogate after the debate. But her harsh words toward McCain Republicans still linger. During her campaign for governor, she told this subset of Republicans to \u201cget the hell out\u201d and claimed she \u201cdrove a stake through the heart of the McCain machine\u201d. Gibson McKay, a Republican lobbyist, was an aide to McCain. He donated thousands of dollars to Lake\u2019s gubernatorial campaign, but her comments on his former boss soured him. He\u2019s now one of the Trump-Gallego crossover voters who would be needed for both the former president and Democratic congressman to win the state. \u201cJohn McCain was my friend. She can play that game with her Turning Point friends, and she\u2019ll never have my support because of that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s mean, it\u2019s ugly, and it\u2019s what\u2019s tearing down on the fabric of American politics.\u201d He\u2019s friends \u2013 \u201ca friend friend, not like a political friend\u201d \u2013 with Gallego and his name was on a fundraiser for the congressman this year. A conservative, he aligns more with Lake on policy, but a few factors, including his personal friendship with Gallego, played into his decision to back the Democrat this cycle. He also believes Gallego is more authentic than Lake, just as he believes Trump is more authentic than Harris. McKay\u2019s support for Gallego hasn\u2019t gone over well with some of his Republican friends. McKay is an elected precinct committeeman, the foot-soldiers of political activism. Republicans in his legislative district censured him for supporting the Democrat, and there was an effort afoot to try to remove his duties in his elected role. McKay says he hasn\u2019t seen evidence Lake is trying to make peace, and it wouldn\u2019t ring true if she tried it. Earlier this year, McCain\u2019s daughter, Meghan McCain, rejected the idea, saying: \u201cNo peace, bitch. We see you for who you are \u2013 and are repulsed by it.\u201d Debate gives Lake a boost On Wednesday, Lake and Gallego met on stage for their only televised debate this cycle. From the jump, Lake, comfortable in front of the camera after decades anchoring the television news, attacked Gallego over immigration, her strongest issue. She claimed a red-eye flight out of Phoenix\u2019s airport \u201clooks like a migrant encampment\u201d because migrants first come to Arizona before shipping out elsewhere. Gallego, stiff and sticking to talking points, pushed Lake on abortion and her shifting positions. (She had previously expressed support for Arizona\u2019s pre-statehood abortion ban before the Supreme Court upheld the law, sparking a massive backlash. She backed the state GOP\u2019s effort to repeal the law and reinstate a 15-week ban. Gallego has said he would support a federal law restoring Roe, which protects abortion until the point of fetal viability, roughly about 22 weeks of pregnancy.) The two issues typically top lists of importance for voters in Arizona, which shares a border with Mexico. An abortion ballot measure to increase access to the procedure beyond the current 15-week ban is also before voters in November, probably buoying turnout and expected to pass easily. Lake stumbled a bit on her reproductive health care responses, erroneously calling in-vitro fertilization \u201cUVF\u201d \u2013 it is abbreviated IVF \u2013 while repeatedly pointing out she was a woman who had many women in her family and attempting to pivot. \u201cI\u2019m astounded that he actually knows the difference between a woman and a man,\u201d she cracked at one point, \u201cbecause I thought there were, what, 147 different genders. I do care about women\u2019s rights.\u201d Lake also made it personal: she called Gallego a sexual harasser and brought up family ties to drug cartels, a charge Gallego ignored. He previously grew emotional while addressing the claims in a press conference, saying he\u2019d worked his entire life to get away from his father\u2019s misdeeds. Gallego repeatedly raised Lake\u2019s refusal to accept her defeat in the 2022 race for Arizona governor. He called her dangerous, noting how her election lies led one election official to need private security because of increased threats. The debate ended with Gallego sharing his personal story, his biggest asset on the campaign trail. \u201cI\u2019m a very lucky man,\u201d he said to the camera in a closing statement. \u201cI\u2019m just lucky to be born in the best country in this world. And by all counts, I shouldn\u2019t even be here. My mom raised us alone, and with a real belief in the American dream, and a real want to succeed, I got to where I am.\u201d Given the final word, Lake promised that as a senator she would usher in a \u201cstrong, secure border\u201d and \u201cstrong Trump economy\u201d. Then she echoed her opponent. \u201cIf there\u2019s any kiddos watching, I don\u2019t want you to worry,\u201d Lake concluded. \u201cI want you to dream really big. I want you to know that we\u2019re going to turn this country around, and your American dream will become reality.\u201d",

Challenger Deep, at the southern end of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean, is 10.9km (6.8 miles) below sea level \u2013 deeper than Mount Everest (8.8km [5.5 miles]) is tall. Wright\u2019s summer 2022 descent is documented in a new book, <em>Mapping the Deep</em>, written with her input. The dive was undertaken in a two-person submersible called Limiting Factor owned (since sold) by <a href=\"https://caladanoceanic.com/\">Caladan Oceanic</a>, an ocean expedition company founded by investor turned deep sea explorer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/dec/22/wall-street-trader-reaches-bottom-of-atlantic-in-bid-to-conquer-five-oceans\">Victor Vescovo</a>, who was also the craft\u2019s pilot. Wright, 63, who also goes by the moniker \u201cDeepsea Dawn\u201d, is the chief scientist of Esri, a multinational that makes geographic information system (GIS) software for mapping and spatial analytics. </p> <p><strong>Sending people to the deep ocean can be dangerous because of the extreme underwater pressure. </strong><strong>Last year</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>OceanGate</strong><strong>\u2019s </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/22/titanic-sub-titan-debris-field-search-area-latest\">Titan submersible imploded</a></strong><strong> on a journey to view the wreck of the </strong><strong>Titanic</strong><strong>, killing all </strong><strong>five</strong><strong> passengers on board</strong><strong>. Why not just leave it to robots? <br></strong>Most of the exploration in the ocean is done by robots \u2013 it\u2019s just more efficient, especially for mapping. But occasionally, it is important for a human to go down. It can be <em>the</em> way to get the best understanding of how a particular part of the Earth is working or solve a scientific mystery. In the case of Challenger Deep it is an iconic place and we had a scientific mission.</p> <p>OceanGate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/21/titanic-submersible-documents-reveal-multiple-concerns-raised-over-safety-of-vessel\">didn\u2019t take proper safety precautions</a>. The sub wasn\u2019t certified, and the hull was cylindrical and made of carbon fibre. The sub I went down in had a hull machined to be as close to perfectly spherical as possible \u2013 it is the geometry that protects you from hydrostatic pressure \u2013 and it was made of titanium \u2013 the strongest material for the purpose. It was also certified: I wouldn\u2019t have gone otherwise.</p> <p><strong>What was the scientific point of your trip? </strong><br>Challenger Deep is made up of three depressions and my dive was to the least visited, Western Pool. We were the first to set eyes on some of the ground we covered.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We saw anemones, sea cucumbers, amphipods \u2013 all withstanding huge pressure and functioning in complete darkness and cold</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On the engineering side, it was to test a prototype instrument: a portable sidescan sonar specifically designed to withstand pressure and work at any ocean depth. </p> <p>Then we undertook multibeam sonar mapping from the support ship to give us a fresh map of the entirety of Challenger Deep and the Mariana Trench. That data has been deposited with <a href=\"https://seabed2030.org/\">Seabed 2030</a>, a global collaborative effort to completely map the seabed by 2030 which Esri is part of.</p> <p><strong>What was the dive like and what did you see?<br></strong>It was about a 10-hour round trip with two-and-a-half hours at the bottom to observe and test the prototype instrument, which we did over an area of a few hundred square metres. The spherical cockpit is a tight space and Victor and I sat with everything that we needed within reach. There is no toilet, so I had to safely dehydrate before the dive.</p> <p>At around 1,000m you get into complete darkness. Through the sub\u2019s portholes, we saw bioluminescent jellyfish and worm-like siphonophores, which flashed back at us when Victor flashed the sub\u2019s lights on them. The first moments of reaching the bottom were disheartening \u2013 we saw a beer bottle \u2013 but the rest was wonderful. We observed vast fields of boulders: evidence of the two tectonic plates that are colliding in that zone (the old, heavy Pacific Plate is diving underneath the Philippine Sea Plate). And we saw tiny creatures such as anemones, sea cucumbers and amphipods [a type of crustacean] \u2013 all withstanding huge pressure and functioning in complete darkness and cold. Our images and samples are being studied by marine biologists.</p>    <p><strong>Your career includes </strong><strong>over 20 ship-based </strong><strong>research expeditions and </strong><strong>dives in other submersibles</strong><strong>. You have also pioneered the application of GIS to seafloor and ocean mapping. What got you interested in ocean science? <br></strong>I grew up in the Hawaiian islands and I was always at the beach. But I became fascinated by the geology too: living somewhere that started off as volcanoes under the sea and then rose. Combine that with watching Jacques Cousteau on TV and reading ocean adventure books and I made the decision at age eight to become an oceanographer.</p> <p>My first submersible dive was in 1991 in a research vessel called Alvin. It was to make observations of the geology and biology and map the distribution of hydrothermal vents (undersea hot springs) in a segment of the East Pacific Rise, the seafloor spreading zone in the Pacific Ocean. It was one of the first studies applying GIS to seabed mapping anywhere. You can get lost in a map of the ocean floor.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I worry deep-sea mining would be massively damaging to large parts of the seabed which are habitats to all sorts of biota</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>One of your bugbears is that so little of the seafloor has been mapped to date in high resolution. Is it really </strong><em><strong>that</strong></em><strong> bad? <br></strong>Yes! Our current collective estimate is that we have 26.1% of the ocean mapped to the modern detail that we need. That\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about our home, given about 70% of our planet is ocean. </p> <p>The longer it takes for us to map <em>all</em> the seabed in detail, the more we play with fire: it is vital for so many things. For example, it gives us a better understanding of ocean volume, enabling climate scientists to build better models of climate change, improves our predictions of how tsunamis will behave and enables the design of protected marine habitats. </p> <p><strong>Interest is growing in </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/09/deep-sea-mining-why-is-interest-growing-and-what-are-the-risks\">deep-sea mining</a></strong><strong>.

Can deep-sea mining be done sustainably? Won\u2019t better mapping of the seafloor aid mining companies to pursue extraction?</strong><strong> </strong><strong><br></strong>The Seabed 2030 data is unlikely to be fine-grained enough for a mining operation. But the project\u2019s data is open: anyone can use it. If mining companies are doing their own mapping of the seafloor, my hope is they would be willing to contribute it to Seabed 2030 to speed up ocean mapping and benefit us all.</p> <p>At this point, I don\u2019t think it is possible to do it sustainably. The environmental assessments aren\u2019t done and many of us don\u2019t trust that they will be done properly. I have, in my personal capacity, signed a <a href=\"https://seabedminingsciencestatement.org/\">statement from marine experts</a> calling for a moratorium while potential impacts to the ocean environment are studied. I worry it would be massively damaging to large parts of the seafloor which are habitats to all sorts of biota.</p> <p><strong>What would you like young women of colour who want a career in ocean science to know? <br></strong>That this type of work is for them too! And that there are <a href=\"https://www.bweems.org/\">organisations that support</a> Black marine scientists that weren\u2019t there when I was coming along.

Wright\u2019s summer 2022 descent is documented in a new book, Mapping the Deep, written with her input. The dive was undertaken in a two-person submersible called Limiting Factor owned (since sold) by Caladan Oceanic, an ocean expedition company founded by investor turned deep sea explorer Victor Vescovo, who was also the craft\u2019s pilot. Wright, 63, who also goes by the moniker \u201cDeepsea Dawn\u201d, is the chief scientist of Esri, a multinational that makes geographic information system (GIS) software for mapping and spatial analytics. Sending people to the deep ocean can be dangerous because of the extreme underwater pressure. Last year, OceanGate\u2019s Titan submersible imploded on a journey to view the wreck of the Titanic, killing all five passengers on board. Why not just leave it to robots? Most of the exploration in the ocean is done by robots \u2013 it\u2019s just more efficient, especially for mapping. But occasionally, it is important for a human to go down. It can be the way to get the best understanding of how a particular part of the Earth is working or solve a scientific mystery. In the case of Challenger Deep it is an iconic place and we had a scientific mission. OceanGate didn\u2019t take proper safety precautions. The sub wasn\u2019t certified, and the hull was cylindrical and made of carbon fibre. The sub I went down in had a hull machined to be as close to perfectly spherical as possible \u2013 it is the geometry that protects you from hydrostatic pressure \u2013 and it was made of titanium \u2013 the strongest material for the purpose. It was also certified: I wouldn\u2019t have gone otherwise. What was the scientific point of your trip? Challenger Deep is made up of three depressions and my dive was to the least visited, Western Pool. We were the first to set eyes on some of the ground we covered. On the engineering side, it was to test a prototype instrument: a portable sidescan sonar specifically designed to withstand pressure and work at any ocean depth. Then we undertook multibeam sonar mapping from the support ship to give us a fresh map of the entirety of Challenger Deep and the Mariana Trench. That data has been deposited with Seabed 2030, a global collaborative effort to completely map the seabed by 2030 which Esri is part of. What was the dive like and what did you see? It was about a 10-hour round trip with two-and-a-half hours at the bottom to observe and test the prototype instrument, which we did over an area of a few hundred square metres. The spherical cockpit is a tight space and Victor and I sat with everything that we needed within reach. There is no toilet, so I had to safely dehydrate before the dive. At around 1,000m you get into complete darkness. Through the sub\u2019s portholes, we saw bioluminescent jellyfish and worm-like siphonophores, which flashed back at us when Victor flashed the sub\u2019s lights on them. The first moments of reaching the bottom were disheartening \u2013 we saw a beer bottle \u2013 but the rest was wonderful. We observed vast fields of boulders: evidence of the two tectonic plates that are colliding in that zone (the old, heavy Pacific Plate is diving underneath the Philippine Sea Plate). And we saw tiny creatures such as anemones, sea cucumbers and amphipods [a type of crustacean] \u2013 all withstanding huge pressure and functioning in complete darkness and cold. Our images and samples are being studied by marine biologists. Your career includes over 20 ship-based research expeditions and dives in other submersibles. You have also pioneered the application of GIS to seafloor and ocean mapping. What got you interested in ocean science? I grew up in the Hawaiian islands and I was always at the beach. But I became fascinated by the geology too: living somewhere that started off as volcanoes under the sea and then rose. Combine that with watching Jacques Cousteau on TV and reading ocean adventure books and I made the decision at age eight to become an oceanographer. My first submersible dive was in 1991 in a research vessel called Alvin. It was to make observations of the geology and biology and map the distribution of hydrothermal vents (undersea hot springs) in a segment of the East Pacific Rise, the seafloor spreading zone in the Pacific Ocean. It was one of the first studies applying GIS to seabed mapping anywhere. You can get lost in a map of the ocean floor. One of your bugbears is that so little of the seafloor has been mapped to date in high resolution. Is it really that bad? Yes! Our current collective estimate is that we have 26.1% of the ocean mapped to the modern detail that we need. That\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about our home, given about 70% of our planet is ocean. The longer it takes for us to map all the seabed in detail, the more we play with fire: it is vital for so many things. For example, it gives us a better understanding of ocean volume, enabling climate scientists to build better models of climate change, improves our predictions of how tsunamis will behave and enables the design of protected marine habitats. Interest is growing in deep-sea mining. The International Seabed Authority plans to release regulations on the practice next year while Norway is pressing ahead with opening its own waters. Can deep-sea mining be done sustainably? Won\u2019t better mapping of the seafloor aid mining companies to pursue extraction? The Seabed 2030 data is unlikely to be fine-grained enough for a mining operation. But the project\u2019s data is open: anyone can use it. If mining companies are doing their own mapping of the seafloor, my hope is they would be willing to contribute it to Seabed 2030 to speed up ocean mapping and benefit us all. At this point, I don\u2019t think it is possible to do it sustainably. The environmental assessments aren\u2019t done and many of us don\u2019t trust that they will be done properly. I have, in my personal capacity, signed a statement from marine experts calling for a moratorium while potential impacts to the ocean environment are studied. I worry it would be massively damaging to large parts of the seafloor which are habitats to all sorts of biota. What would you like young women of colour who want a career in ocean science to know? That this type of work is for them too! And that there are organisations that support Black marine scientists that weren\u2019t there when I was coming along. All young people should pursue what they love and not let others divert them from that path. I was told once I was not cut out to be an oceanographer: I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t follow that advice.

      "body": "<p>Way back in 2011 Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist with aspirations to be a public intellectual, <a href=\"https://a16z.com/why-software-is-eating-the-world/\">published an essay</a> entitled \u201cWhy Software Is Eating the World\u201d, predicting that computer code would take over large swaths of the economy. Thirteen years on, software now seems to be chomping its way through academia as well. This, at any rate, is one possible conclusion to be drawn from the fact that the computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton shares the 2024 <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2024/press-release/\">Nobel prize in physics</a> with John Hopfield, and that the computer scientist Demis Hassabis shares half of the <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/press-release/\">Nobel prize in chemistry</a> with one of his DeepMind colleagues, John Jumper.</p> <p>The award to Hassabis and Jumper was, in a way, predictable, for they built a machine \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/british-computer-scientist-sir-demis-hassabis-awarded-chemistry-nobel-prize/ar-AA1rX2z5\">AlphaFold2</a> \u2013 that enables researchers to solve one of the toughest problems in biochemistry: predicting the structure of proteins, the building blocks of biological life. Their machine has been able to predict the structure of virtually all the 200m proteins that researchers have identified. So it\u2019s a big deal \u2013 for chemistry.</p> <p>But Hinton is not a physicist. Indeed, he was once <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/technology/nobel-prize-geoffrey-hinton-ai.html#\">introduced at an academic conference</a> as someone who had \u201cfailed at physics, dropped out of psychology and then joined a field with no standards at all: artificial intelligence\u201d. And he spent a year after graduation working as a carpenter. Yet he\u2019s the guy who found the method (\u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation\">backpropagation</a>\u201d) that enables neural networks to learn, which was one of the two keys that unlocked machine learning and triggered the current manic rise of AI. (The other was the invention of the <a href=\"https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)\">transformer model</a> by Google researchers in 2017).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Seamus Heaney described the experience of winning a Nobel as \u2018like being hit by a mostly benign avalanche\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Where\u2019s the physics in all this, though? That comes from Hopfield, with whom Hinton shares the prize. \u201cHopfield networks and a further development of them called Boltzmann machines were based on physics,\u201d Hinton explained to the man from the <em>New York Times</em>. \u201cHopfield nets used an energy function, and the Boltzmann machine used ideas from statistical physics. So that stage in the development of neural networks did depend \u2013 a lot \u2013 on ideas from physics.\u201d</p> <p>So that\u2019s all right then. But the media often describe Hinton as \u201cthe godfather of AI\u201d, which has a vaguely sinister ring to it. In person he\u2019s the opposite: tall, amiable, courteous, cerebral and endowed with a wry and occasionally caustic wit. When asked by Cade Metz for his reaction when he got the news of the prize, he replied that he was \u201cshocked and amazed and flabbergasted\u201d, which I guess is what most people say. But in 2018 he shared the Turing award \u2013 computer science\u2019s equivalent of the Nobel \u2013 with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun, for their work on deep learning. So he was always in the top league. It\u2019s just that there isn\u2019t a Nobel prize in computer science. Given the way software is eating the world, maybe that should change.</p> <p>There\u2019s an old joke that the key to becoming a Nobel laureate is to \u201clive longer\u201d than your rivals. Hinton, now 77, clearly took note. But actually the most admirable thing about him is the dogged persistence with which he continued to believe in the potential of neural networks as a key to artificial intelligence long after the idea had been discredited by the discipline. Given how academia works, especially in a fast-developing discipline like computer science, that required exceptional determination and self-confidence. Perhaps what kept him going in his darker moments was the thought that his great-great-grandfather was George Boole, the 19th-century mathematician who invented the logic that underpins <em>all</em> of this digital stuff.</p> <p>One thinks also about the impact that the prize has on people. When news of Hinton\u2019s prize came through I thought of Seamus Heaney, who was awarded the literature prize in 1995. He described the experience as \u201clike being hit by a <em>mostly</em> benign avalanche\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Way back in 2011 Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist with aspirations to be a public intellectual, published an essay entitled \u201cWhy Software Is Eating the World\u201d, predicting that computer code would take over large swaths of the economy. Thirteen years on, software now seems to be chomping its way through academia as well. This, at any rate, is one possible conclusion to be drawn from the fact that the computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton shares the 2024 Nobel prize in physics with John Hopfield, and that the computer scientist Demis Hassabis shares half of the Nobel prize in chemistry with one of his DeepMind colleagues, John Jumper. The award to Hassabis and Jumper was, in a way, predictable, for they built a machine \u2013 AlphaFold2 \u2013 that enables researchers to solve one of the toughest problems in biochemistry: predicting the structure of proteins, the building blocks of biological life. Their machine has been able to predict the structure of virtually all the 200m proteins that researchers have identified. So it\u2019s a big deal \u2013 for chemistry. But Hinton is not a physicist. Indeed, he was once introduced at an academic conference as someone who had \u201cfailed at physics, dropped out of psychology and then joined a field with no standards at all: artificial intelligence\u201d. And he spent a year after graduation working as a carpenter. Yet he\u2019s the guy who found the method (\u201cbackpropagation\u201d) that enables neural networks to learn, which was one of the two keys that unlocked machine learning and triggered the current manic rise of AI. (The other was the invention of the transformer model by Google researchers in 2017). Where\u2019s the physics in all this, though? That comes from Hopfield, with whom Hinton shares the prize. \u201cHopfield networks and a further development of them called Boltzmann machines were based on physics,\u201d Hinton explained to the man from the New York Times. \u201cHopfield nets used an energy function, and the Boltzmann machine used ideas from statistical physics. So that stage in the development of neural networks did depend \u2013 a lot \u2013 on ideas from physics.\u201d So that\u2019s all right then. But the media often describe Hinton as \u201cthe godfather of AI\u201d, which has a vaguely sinister ring to it. In person he\u2019s the opposite: tall, amiable, courteous, cerebral and endowed with a wry and occasionally caustic wit. When asked by Cade Metz for his reaction when he got the news of the prize, he replied that he was \u201cshocked and amazed and flabbergasted\u201d, which I guess is what most people say. But in 2018 he shared the Turing award \u2013 computer science\u2019s equivalent of the Nobel \u2013 with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun, for their work on deep learning. So he was always in the top league. It\u2019s just that there isn\u2019t a Nobel prize in computer science. Given the way software is eating the world, maybe that should change. There\u2019s an old joke that the key to becoming a Nobel laureate is to \u201clive longer\u201d than your rivals. Hinton, now 77, clearly took note. But actually the most admirable thing about him is the dogged persistence with which he continued to believe in the potential of neural networks as a key to artificial intelligence long after the idea had been discredited by the discipline. Given how academia works, especially in a fast-developing discipline like computer science, that required exceptional determination and self-confidence. Perhaps what kept him going in his darker moments was the thought that his great-great-grandfather was George Boole, the 19th-century mathematician who invented the logic that underpins all of this digital stuff. One thinks also about the impact that the prize has on people. When news of Hinton\u2019s prize came through I thought of Seamus Heaney, who was awarded the literature prize in 1995. He described the experience as \u201clike being hit by a mostly benign avalanche\u201d. Note that \u201cmostly\u201d: one of the consequences of a Nobel is that winners immediately become public property, of which everyone and their dog wants a slice. \u201cAll I do nowadays is \u2018turn up\u2019,\u201d Heaney wrote resignedly to a friend in June 1996. \u201cI\u2019m a function of timetables, not an agent of my own being. And it\u2019s going to be like this for weeks and months still\u2026 Whatever the Stockholm effect will be finally, its immediate result is a desire to quit the job and get started again in propria persona (in my own person).\u201d So\u2026 Memo to Geoff: many congrats.

The 45-year-old was being modest when he acknowledged September\u2019s games against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/sep/06/bellamy-starts-wales-reign-with-draw-against-turkey-despite-yilmaz-red\">Turkey</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/sep/09/montenegro-wales-nations-league-match-report\">Montenegro</a> \u201cgot one or two more people interested\u201d.</p> <p>Wales have begun with vim in every game under Bellamy, with more early goals in Iceland after two in the first three minutes in Montenegro, whom they host on Monday. In his first game Turkey seemed startled by Wales\u2019s swarming, blood-pumping nature, Bellamy\u2019s side determined to commit numbers and ambush the opposition at every opportunity. \u201cEvery part of what we do is to score,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cWhen our goalkeeper has the ball: how quick can we get to their goal?\u201d</p> <p>Bellamy told how his excitement for the job increased this month after being reunited with his squad at the Vale Resort on the outskirts of Cardiff. Wales are fun and there is a freshness to the plan, an adventure and a licence to thrill, but it is not without its flaws. The first-half display in Iceland was dynamic, the second a reminder to temper expectations.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve scored four goals away from home [under Bellamy] and that\u2019s what we\u2019re about,\u201d said the striker Kieffer Moore. \u201cWe\u2019re a high-press, high-attacking team and when we do get those chances in that style of play it\u2019s exciting. It gets people on their feet but sometimes it can work against you as well.\u201d</p> <p>Wales badly faded, Oli Cooper\u2019s shot the only vaguely memorable action inside the Iceland half after the interval. Towards the end it was fraught; Ben Cabango did well to prevent an incisive pass reaching Andri Gudjohnsen as Iceland sought a winner and in stoppage time the goalkeeper Danny Ward was booked for time-wasting.</p>    <p>Perhaps the lack of mileage in the legs of players at club level this season was a factor; only Tottenham\u2019s Brennan Johnson, who scored his seventh goal in his past seven games, is a regular in the top flight.</p> <p>Harry Wilson and Neco Williams, Wales\u2019s best performers on the night, are bit-part players for Fulham and Nottingham Forest respectively. Ben Davies, captain in the absence of Aaron Ramsey, is yet to play a minute for Spurs in the Premier League this season. Bellamy is encountering familiar hurdles.</p> <p>Bellamy said a light-hearted exchange with J\u00f3hann Berg Gudmundsson, the Iceland captain with whom Bellamy worked while assistant to Vincent Kompany at Burnley, served to confirm the details of why the game slipped from Wales\u2019s grasp. Wales\u2019s tired second-half submissions have proved an unwanted theme in this Bellamy era.</p> <p>\u201cEven when he\u2019s moaning, I love him,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cHe was having a pop at me about what he did in the second half, how he completely changed the game. He took a lot of pride in telling me the solution at the end of the game \u2026 but he was right.\u201d</p> <p>Iceland, as Bellamy pointed out, are a capable side with a handful of talented youngsters, including the 20-year-old Orri \u00d3skarsson, who joined Real Sociedad from Copenhagen for \u20ac20m in the summer. \u00c5ge Hareide\u2019s side fell at the final hurdle to qualify for Euro 2024, losing to Ukraine in the playoffs, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/07/england-iceland-international-friendly-match-report\">beat England at Wembley</a> in June.</p> <p>Regardless, Wales, as Lord Sugar would say, completely lost control of the task. Bellamy is hardly an apprentice but these remain early days. In some ways, that is the really exciting bit.</p>",

The other discernible difference since Bellamy took charge in the summer has been the mood among supporters, excited to follow Project Bellamy. The 45-year-old was being modest when he acknowledged September\u2019s games against Turkey and Montenegro \u201cgot one or two more people interested\u201d. Wales have begun with vim in every game under Bellamy, with more early goals in Iceland after two in the first three minutes in Montenegro, whom they host on Monday. In his first game Turkey seemed startled by Wales\u2019s swarming, blood-pumping nature, Bellamy\u2019s side determined to commit numbers and ambush the opposition at every opportunity. \u201cEvery part of what we do is to score,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cWhen our goalkeeper has the ball: how quick can we get to their goal?\u201d Bellamy told how his excitement for the job increased this month after being reunited with his squad at the Vale Resort on the outskirts of Cardiff. Wales are fun and there is a freshness to the plan, an adventure and a licence to thrill, but it is not without its flaws. The first-half display in Iceland was dynamic, the second a reminder to temper expectations. \u201cWe\u2019ve scored four goals away from home [under Bellamy] and that\u2019s what we\u2019re about,\u201d said the striker Kieffer Moore. \u201cWe\u2019re a high-press, high-attacking team and when we do get those chances in that style of play it\u2019s exciting. It gets people on their feet but sometimes it can work against you as well.\u201d Wales badly faded, Oli Cooper\u2019s shot the only vaguely memorable action inside the Iceland half after the interval. Towards the end it was fraught; Ben Cabango did well to prevent an incisive pass reaching Andri Gudjohnsen as Iceland sought a winner and in stoppage time the goalkeeper Danny Ward was booked for time-wasting. Perhaps the lack of mileage in the legs of players at club level this season was a factor; only Tottenham\u2019s Brennan Johnson, who scored his seventh goal in his past seven games, is a regular in the top flight. Harry Wilson and Neco Williams, Wales\u2019s best performers on the night, are bit-part players for Fulham and Nottingham Forest respectively. Ben Davies, captain in the absence of Aaron Ramsey, is yet to play a minute for Spurs in the Premier League this season. Bellamy is encountering familiar hurdles. Bellamy said a light-hearted exchange with J\u00f3hann Berg Gudmundsson, the Iceland captain with whom Bellamy worked while assistant to Vincent Kompany at Burnley, served to confirm the details of why the game slipped from Wales\u2019s grasp. Wales\u2019s tired second-half submissions have proved an unwanted theme in this Bellamy era. \u201cEven when he\u2019s moaning, I love him,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cHe was having a pop at me about what he did in the second half, how he completely changed the game. He took a lot of pride in telling me the solution at the end of the game \u2026 but he was right.\u201d Iceland, as Bellamy pointed out, are a capable side with a handful of talented youngsters, including the 20-year-old Orri \u00d3skarsson, who joined Real Sociedad from Copenhagen for \u20ac20m in the summer. \u00c5ge Hareide\u2019s side fell at the final hurdle to qualify for Euro 2024, losing to Ukraine in the playoffs, but beat England at Wembley in June. Regardless, Wales, as Lord Sugar would say, completely lost control of the task. Bellamy is hardly an apprentice but these remain early days. In some ways, that is the really exciting bit.",

      "body": "<p>Evan Dando was born in Essex, Massachusetts, in 1967 and moved to Boston aged nine. In 1986 he co-founded alt-rock band the Lemonheads (initially known as the Whelps), putting out four albums before their 1992 breakthrough <em>It\u2019s a Shame About Ray</em> and hit cover of Mrs Robinson. The band has since released another five albums and Dando a solo 2003 record entitled <em>Baby I\u2019m Bored</em>. Dando now lives in Brazil with his partner, video-maker Antonia Teixeira. He plays La Belle Angele in Edinburgh on 16 October, touring the UK until the end of the month. </p> <h2><strong>1. </strong><strong>Documentary</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/09/brazil-elis-tom-album-documentary\">Elis &amp; Tom (Dir Roberto de Oliveira, Jom Tob Azulay)</a></strong></p>    <p>I went to the premiere of this documentary in S\u00e3o Paulo last year, about Elis Regina and Tom Jobim [Brazilian musicians who released the bossa nova album <em>Elis &amp; Tom</em> in 1974]. It\u2019s definitely the happiest music \u2013 Waters of March is one of the best songs in the world \u2013 and the film was great. There were no subtitles at the premiere but I just let it wash over me. The director had the footage for ages and he finally decided to put it together. I\u2019m very glad he did.</p> <h2><strong>2. </strong><strong>Restaurant</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://barpittirestaurant.com/\">Bar Pitti, New York</a></strong></p>    <p>This is just my favourite little restaurant. It\u2019s right for any mood, you can go in there and always find something you want. It\u2019s a calm and peaceful place with amazing food. I usually get the gnocchi or the minestrone soup. Last time I got pasta carbonara \u2013 they make their own pasta and it\u2019s really delicious. Italian food is not too fattening. Well, it can be, but this is a really ideal place to go if you want to chill and eat great food and just have the New York experience. I recommend it really highly.</p> <h2><strong>3. </strong><strong>Website</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.yyyyyyy.info/\">yyyyyyy.info</a></strong></p>    <p>Oh, man, this website is totally weird. I found out about it on some YouTube video last year and I keep getting people to check it out. It\u2019s complete mayhem \u2013 layers of different colours and random text and crazy pictures and weird music \u2013 but it\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s different every time you go in, and if you click on something it\u2019ll send you on a journey. I can\u2019t tell whether it\u2019s some surveillance thing or an art thing or, like, a satanic cult, but it\u2019s everything you want a website to be. As arcane as it gets.</p> <h2><strong>4. </strong><strong>Music</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://cooperbhandy.com/\">Lucy</a></strong></p>    <p>Lucy is a project by a guy called Cooper B Handy, who also plays guitar in the Taxidermists. He\u2019s done all these crazy tapes and a few years back he started messing with an 808 drum machine and putting out more electronic stuff. <em>Best of Lucy</em> was the first tape I got. It\u2019s fantastic. The songs are all short, like a minute thirty, and they\u2019re anthemic \u2013 he writes really catchy tunes. He\u2019s playing the Camden Assembly in London on 30 October \u2013 unfortunately we\u2019re playing the same night in Islington so I\u2019ll miss it.</p>    <h2><strong>5. </strong><strong>Book</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/15/celine-journey-cutting-edge-literature\">Journey to the End of the Night by </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/15/celine-journey-cutting-edge-literature\">C\u00e9line</a></strong></p> <p>C\u00e9line was a horrible person later in life \u2013 a collaborationist, an antisemite \u2013 but I loved this book. I read it when I was younger and listened to it again recently on Audible. It\u2019s just so good \u2013 ahead of its time and so funny. You laugh out loud a lot.

      "bodyText": "Evan Dando was born in Essex, Massachusetts, in 1967 and moved to Boston aged nine. In 1986 he co-founded alt-rock band the Lemonheads (initially known as the Whelps), putting out four albums before their 1992 breakthrough It\u2019s a Shame About Ray and hit cover of Mrs Robinson. The band has since released another five albums and Dando a solo 2003 record entitled Baby I\u2019m Bored. Dando now lives in Brazil with his partner, video-maker Antonia Teixeira. He plays La Belle Angele in Edinburgh on 16 October, touring the UK until the end of the month. 1. Documentary Elis &amp; Tom (Dir Roberto de Oliveira, Jom Tob Azulay) I went to the premiere of this documentary in S\u00e3o Paulo last year, about Elis Regina and Tom Jobim [Brazilian musicians who released the bossa nova album Elis &amp; Tom in 1974]. It\u2019s definitely the happiest music \u2013 Waters of March is one of the best songs in the world \u2013 and the film was great. There were no subtitles at the premiere but I just let it wash over me. The director had the footage for ages and he finally decided to put it together. I\u2019m very glad he did. 2. Restaurant Bar Pitti, New York This is just my favourite little restaurant. It\u2019s right for any mood, you can go in there and always find something you want. It\u2019s a calm and peaceful place with amazing food. I usually get the gnocchi or the minestrone soup. Last time I got pasta carbonara \u2013 they make their own pasta and it\u2019s really delicious. Italian food is not too fattening. Well, it can be, but this is a really ideal place to go if you want to chill and eat great food and just have the New York experience. I recommend it really highly. 3. Website yyyyyyy.info Oh, man, this website is totally weird. I found out about it on some YouTube video last year and I keep getting people to check it out. It\u2019s complete mayhem \u2013 layers of different colours and random text and crazy pictures and weird music \u2013 but it\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s different every time you go in, and if you click on something it\u2019ll send you on a journey. I can\u2019t tell whether it\u2019s some surveillance thing or an art thing or, like, a satanic cult, but it\u2019s everything you want a website to be. As arcane as it gets. 4. Music Lucy Lucy is a project by a guy called Cooper B Handy, who also plays guitar in the Taxidermists. He\u2019s done all these crazy tapes and a few years back he started messing with an 808 drum machine and putting out more electronic stuff. Best of Lucy was the first tape I got. It\u2019s fantastic. The songs are all short, like a minute thirty, and they\u2019re anthemic \u2013 he writes really catchy tunes. He\u2019s playing the Camden Assembly in London on 30 October \u2013 unfortunately we\u2019re playing the same night in Islington so I\u2019ll miss it. 5. Book Journey to the End of the Night by C\u00e9line C\u00e9line was a horrible person later in life \u2013 a collaborationist, an antisemite \u2013 but I loved this book. I read it when I was younger and listened to it again recently on Audible. It\u2019s just so good \u2013 ahead of its time and so funny. You laugh out loud a lot. It\u2019s a semi-autobiographical story of a medical student\u2019s experience in the first world war and all the horrors he encounters then and afterwards. Reading it, you can\u2019t believe it was written in the 1930s. Things weren\u2019t that different back then \u2013 that\u2019s the scary part. 6. Bar Liar\u2019s Club, Chicago I think this is one of the five best bars in the world. I started going in the 2000s and I\u2019ve never stopped. I\u2019ve seen a lot of great music there \u2013 DJs and live acts \u2013 and I\u2019ve played there a few times as well. It\u2019s a rock\u2019n\u2019roll bar with black walls and crazy red lights that make it look like Christmas all the time and punk memorabilia everywhere. It\u2019s a really special place. If you\u2019re in Chicago, you\u2019ve got to go. That\u2019s where you see the real culture.",

This isn\u2019t just meddling \u2013 it\u2019s full-blown interference aimed at destabilising our future.

But, three years later, Moldova remains mired in economic and political instability.</p> <p>First, the country was plunged into an energy crisis when Kremlin-controlled Gazprom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/25/russias-gazprom-to-make-drastic-cut-to-europes-gas-supply-from-wednesday\">slashed gas supplies</a> to the country by one-third and demanded more than double the previous rates to maintain the flow, in what was widely seen as political payback from Moscow for Sandu\u2019s pro-western stance. Then, Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine pushed Moldova into a broader financial crisis.</p> <p>Located just a few hours<strong> </strong>drive from Odesa, Moldova took in the highest number of Ukrainian refugees per capita, placing immense strain on its healthcare system, public services, and infrastructure.

But he has done little to distance himself from the accusations of trying to interfere in Moldovan politics from abroad. Through the social network Telegram, he has offered to pay voters the equivalent of $29 if they registered for his campaign, promising money to people who would \u201cconvince as many people as possible at their polling station\u201d to vote \u201cno or abstain\u201d in the referendum.</p> <p>He has publicly pledged to pay Moldovans for publishing anti-EU posts on Facebook and Telegram.</p> <p>The central \u201cfear-mongering\u201d narrative that Shor has been promoting centres around the claim that Chi\u0219in\u0103u\u2019s pro-European policies are pushing the country towards war with Russia, said Vadim <a href=\"https://europeanleadershipnetwork.org/person/vadim-pistrinciuc/\">Pistrinciuc</a>, the director at the Institute for Strategic Initiatives of Moldova, a thinktank.</p> <p>\u201cWe have never faced this level of foreign interference,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Worryingly for officials in Chisinau, Shor\u2019s tactics have proven effective elsewhere the country.</p> <p>Last year, Yevgenia Gutsul, a previously unknown Shor-backed candidate, caused a political earthquake by winning the elections of governor in Gagauzia, another small, Russian-speaking semi-autonomous region in the south of the country.</p> <p>Pro-Russian sentiments have always been high in Gagauzia, a region populated by a Turkic ethnic minority, which has had an uneasy relationship with the capital Chisinau since the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union.</p> <p>But Gutsul\u2019s rise from obscurity and her ties to the Kremlin has stunned even seasoned observers and have prompted questions over Moscow\u2019s role in her elections.</p> <p>\u201cShe was polling at zero two weeks before the elections and then suddenly she appears and wins,\u201d said Mihail Sirkeli, founder of Nokta, an independent media outlet based in Gagauzia.</p> <p>Gutsul, who has openly declared running \u201ca pro-Russian party\u201d and travelled to Moscow to meet with Vladimir Putin after her election, is currently under investigation for allegedly funnelling Russian funds to a party associated with Shor.</p> <p>\u201cShor is looking to repeat the Gagauzia playbook across the country,\u201d said a western diplomat in Chisinau.</p> <p>For now, officials in Moldova believe Moscow is concentrating its efforts on influencing the EU referendum, rather than the presidential elections where Sandu remains by far the most popular politician.</p> <p>\u201cIf the referendum passes, it will lead to constitutional changes, which are harder to reverse in the long term compared to election outcomes,\u201d said a senior Moldovan official.</p> <p>But even if Sandu survives this month\u2019s vote and referendum, her team expects renewed Kremlin efforts next year when her party faces re-election in the country\u2019s parliamentary elections.</p> <p>\u201cRussia\u2019s goal is clear: to keep Moldova stuck in a grey zone,\u201d said Ro\u015fca. \u201cIf they lose Moldova, they lose a strategic foothold in the region.\u201d</p>",

Through the social network Telegram, he has offered to pay voters the equivalent of $29 if they registered for his campaign, promising money to people who would \u201cconvince as many people as possible at their polling station\u201d to vote \u201cno or abstain\u201d in the referendum. He has publicly pledged to pay Moldovans for publishing anti-EU posts on Facebook and Telegram. The central \u201cfear-mongering\u201d narrative that Shor has been promoting centres around the claim that Chi\u0219in\u0103u\u2019s pro-European policies are pushing the country towards war with Russia, said Vadim Pistrinciuc, the director at the Institute for Strategic Initiatives of Moldova, a thinktank. \u201cWe have never faced this level of foreign interference,\u201d he added. Worryingly for officials in Chisinau, Shor\u2019s tactics have proven effective elsewhere the country. Last year, Yevgenia Gutsul, a previously unknown Shor-backed candidate, caused a political earthquake by winning the elections of governor in Gagauzia, another small, Russian-speaking semi-autonomous region in the south of the country. Pro-Russian sentiments have always been high in Gagauzia, a region populated by a Turkic ethnic minority, which has had an uneasy relationship with the capital Chisinau since the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union. But Gutsul\u2019s rise from obscurity and her ties to the Kremlin has stunned even seasoned observers and have prompted questions over Moscow\u2019s role in her elections. \u201cShe was polling at zero two weeks before the elections and then suddenly she appears and wins,\u201d said Mihail Sirkeli, founder of Nokta, an independent media outlet based in Gagauzia. Gutsul, who has openly declared running \u201ca pro-Russian party\u201d and travelled to Moscow to meet with Vladimir Putin after her election, is currently under investigation for allegedly funnelling Russian funds to a party associated with Shor. \u201cShor is looking to repeat the Gagauzia playbook across the country,\u201d said a western diplomat in Chisinau. For now, officials in Moldova believe Moscow is concentrating its efforts on influencing the EU referendum, rather than the presidential elections where Sandu remains by far the most popular politician. \u201cIf the referendum passes, it will lead to constitutional changes, which are harder to reverse in the long term compared to election outcomes,\u201d said a senior Moldovan official. But even if Sandu survives this month\u2019s vote and referendum, her team expects renewed Kremlin efforts next year when her party faces re-election in the country\u2019s parliamentary elections. \u201cRussia\u2019s goal is clear: to keep Moldova stuck in a grey zone,\u201d said Ro\u015fca. \u201cIf they lose Moldova, they lose a strategic foothold in the region.\u201d",

The policy turned deeply intimate facts of Grimm\u2019s life into a media spectacle. With the ACLU, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/23/virginia-school-board-violated-rights-of-transgender-teen-judge-rules\">sued</a> to defend his rights to use facilities that matched his gender, launching a groundbreaking national case on bathroom access. Grimm <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/2017/02/06/katie-couric-gender-revolution-clip/\">became</a> an LGBTQ+ icon, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2017/02/12/why-laverne-cox-told-you-to-google-gavin-grimm/\">celebrated</a> by Laverne Cox at the Grammys and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TEdK8nadfs\">interviewed</a> by Whoopi Goldberg on The View. He eventually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/aug/09/gavin-grimm-trans-bathroom-bill-judge-rules\">won</a> a landmark federal decision asserting trans youth\u2019s constitutional protections against discrimination.</p> \n<p>Advocates hoped the victory would squash the conservative movement\u2019s targeting of trans students. Instead, the climate for trans youth in the US has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/23/anti-trans-bills-us-transgender-youth-sports\">rapidly devolved</a> as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/29/gillian-branstetter-interview-transgender-rights\">laws eroding their rights</a> have been adopted in more than half of the country in recent years. Trans students have increasingly been banned from <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/05/06/1249406353/transgender-bathroom-bill-republican-states\">bathrooms</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2024/trans-sports-girls-florida-bans/\">sports teams</a>, barred from using their pronouns and names, and their existence has been ridiculed by Republican leaders and debated in news segments.</p> \n<p>And while Grimm became a civil rights <a href=\"https://www.amny.com/news/gavin-grimm-representing-aclu-at-nyc-pride-march-1.13642996/\">trailblazer</a>, the case did not secure him stability or financial security. The Pride parade invites have stopped coming, and like so <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/12/31/transgender-food-insecurity/\">many</a> other marginalized trans people, Grimm has faced significant mental health challenges and struggles with poverty. He recently lost his housing, and is now facing homelessness.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m someone who has had worldwide visibility. I represent an outer crust of privilege most people will never see, and I cannot make ends meet no matter how hard I try,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Grimm had little confusion about who he was at a young age. He rejected girl\u2019s clothes, wanted his hair short and legs unshaven and despised the Baptist teachings of his family\u2019s church. He came out as lesbian at 13, but knew the label wasn\u2019t right. Once he learned being trans was a possibility, \u201cthere was no questioning phase,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was like seeing color for the first time.\u201d</p> \n<p>His mother, Deirdre Grimm, knew nothing about trans identity, and vaguely understood it as a \u201csin\u201d. But she read a book her son gave her, learning that affirming a trans kid can dramatically decrease their suicide risk. \u201cThat\u2019s all I needed to know,\u201d Deirdre says one morning in July, seated with her son in his apartment.</p> \n<p>She helped him choose his name and told the rest of the family before his 15th birthday party. Then she switched to an LGBTQ+-affirming church. \u201cSome parents of trans kids talk about this period of \u2018mourning the loss of their daughter\u2019, but I never went through any of that. He just became so much happier. He was also the same person \u2013 the kid who went out to help the homeless, the kid who liked to donate his birthday money.\u201d</p> \n<p>Much of his family rejected him, but many friends and teachers were supportive as he entered 10th grade as a boy and clearly more comfortable in his skin. He initially used a private nurse\u2019s restroom, but it was inconveniently located; peers and staff noted his long bathroom breaks, leaving him alienated and humiliated. So the principal and guidance counselor agreed to let him use the boys\u2019 restroom, and for two months, he had no issues.</p> \n<p>But gossip circulated outside school and on a community Facebook forum, where people posted vicious comments. Friends defending him online faced harassment.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was the adults who made it a problem, because their mentality spread to their kids,\u201d recalls Evelyn Hronec, another friend. \u201cThese were grown adults talking about a 16-year-old\u2019s genitals. It was vile.\u201d</p> \n<p>At school board meetings in 2014, speakers stood feet away from Grimm, misgendering him, asking questions about his body and transition, calling him names and demanding he be kept out of boys\u2019 facilities in the name of \u201csafety\u201d. In one <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My0GYq_Wydw\">speech</a>, Grimm pleaded for the opportunity to \u201cuse the restroom in peace\u201d. When a man <a href=\"https://pub-gloucesterva.escribemeetings.com/Meeting.aspx?Id=a7e4ed07-1735-2513-4f68-7b8ee03799a6&amp;Agenda=Agenda&amp;lang=English\">called</a> him a \u201cfreak\u201d and likened him to an animal, Deirdre lunged out of her seat, she recalls. \u201cI was fighting for his life.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pursuing a lawsuit, Grimm says now, was a way to reclaim his story. \u201cThere was nothing to be lost by standing up for myself. People already didn\u2019t like me or understand me. There already wasn\u2019t a place for me in society. I realized I could choose to make one or slink away. I was either going to live as the boy I was \u2013 or not at all.\u201d</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Grimm\u2019s case progressed at a time of rapid change for LGBTQ+ rights. In 2015, the US supreme court legalized gay marriage and conservative groups <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/23/anti-trans-bills-us-transgender-youth-sports\">shifted focus</a> to trans people, whipping up baseless fears about hypothetical \u201cmale predators\u201d in women\u2019s bathrooms. In 2016, North Carolina faced national scorn and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/03/27/north-carolinas-bathroom-bill-cost-the-state-at-least-3-7-billion-new-analysis-finds/\">costly boycotts</a> for passing an anti-trans bathroom bill, which was later repealed.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/sep/24/donald-trump-presidency-republican-lawmakers-targeting-lgbtq-policies\">If Trump wins the election, he could launch a \u2018catastrophic\u2019 rollback of LGBTQ+ rights</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Grimm was a powerful antidote to the GOP\u2019s dehumanizing messaging, says Joshua Block, the ACLU lawyer who represented him: \u201cGavin\u2019s case really moved the conversation leaps and bounds forward for people\u2019s understanding of trans people, the harms of discrimination and the inanity of these exclusionary policies.\u201d</p> \n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> rolled back LGBTQ+ rights, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/12/revealed-how-trumps-transgender-ban-has-forced-military-members-back-into-hiding\">banning</a> trans servicemembers from the military and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/us/politics/trump-transgender-rights-homeless.html\">authorizing</a> homeless shelters to exclude trans people, Grimm won repeated court victories. But his school district appealed. One court of appeals <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbtq-rights/court-decision-gavin-grimm-case-will-bring-tears-your-eyes\">judge</a> compared Grimm to the historic American plaintiffs who challenged slavery, Japanese concentration camps, segregation and bans on interracial and gay marriage. A 2020 ruling <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/26/court-yes-transgender-rights-gavin-grimm-bathroom-402532\">offered</a> a \u201cresounding yes\u201d in favor of the constitution and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jun/13/us-women-discrimination-title-xi-new-york-historical-society\">civil rights laws</a> protecting trans students from discrimination.</p> \n<p>Grimm graduated before the case was resolved and never got to return to his school\u2019s boys\u2019 bathrooms.</p> \n<p>In 2021, the supreme court <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/supreme-court-allows-gavin-grimms-victory-stand\">allowed</a> Grimm\u2019s victory to stand, and the school board was ordered to <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/gloucester-county-school-board-pay-13-million-resolve-gavin-grimms-case\">pay</a> $1.3m in attorney\u2019s fees.</p> \n<p>Grimm, however, only got a symbolic $1.</p> \n<p>To secure damages, Grimm would\u2019ve had to give the opposition\u2019s lawyers access to his medical records to scrutinize the cause and extent of his emotional distress, a process he couldn\u2019t stomach after years of fighting. The idea he\u2019d have to prove his anguish was unbelievable to his mom, who can\u2019t shake the memories of her son becoming suicidal.</p> \n<p>Grimm doesn\u2019t regret moving on without damages. But he desperately could\u2019ve used financial help \u2013 especially as the trauma of his childhood began to catch up with him.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Inside his Newport News apartment one hot day in July, Grimm sits under a poster he recently hung on his wall celebrating the 19th birthday of his beloved <a href=\"https://x.com/GavinGrimmVA/status/1815226056669876237\">cat</a>, Rascal, whose array of photos is captioned: \u201cDoesn\u2019t look a day over 12!\u201d Grimm\u2019s life revolves around Rascal, he explains: \u201cIf I maintain housing while my cat is still alive, that\u2019s all I can really hope for. I\u2019m prepared to face homelessness, but I just don\u2019t want her to face it.\u201d</p> \n<p>His struggle to stay afloat escalated as his case ended. The networks he\u2019d built through the ACLU fight started to disappear, and his mental and physical health spiraled downward.</p> \n<p>Grimm has complex post-traumatic stress disorder and has suffered from stress-induced seizures that have affected his cognition and left him hospitalized in 2021. \u201cThe PTSD at its core is about not being safe or understood, being rejected, and the adults in my life not acting responsibly,\u201d he explains. \u201cIn high school, I was picked over and hyper-analyzed. I was tortured, harassed and bullied.\u201d He recalls a period when the stress was so severe he\u2019d dissociate as he walked down the hallway, not hearing his friends call his name.</p> \n<p>Grimm also has autism and struggles with sensory processing, and the combined impacts of his disabilities have prevented him from holding down a job or completing school, he says. He\u2019s relied on a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/gavin-grimms-housing-fund\">GoFundMe</a> and disability benefits, but has repeatedly struggled to make rent.</p> \n<p>His mother supports him but also has a tight income, he says. \u201cI don\u2019t have options \u2026 unless some rich gay philanthropist tosses me a crispy million.\u201d At times, he\u2019s felt disposable to the broader movement; he says it\u2019s hard not to think of notable gay rights plaintiffs who have not struggled to make ends meet after their victories.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt makes me so angry that it\u2019s so hard for him to find housing stability,\u201d says Camille Gibson, his best friend who moved to England and video calls him on a nearly daily basis. \u201cSome days, it\u2019s almost like he\u2019s short-circuiting because there\u2019s just so much stress.\u201d Still, the two find ways to have fun with each other from afar, often streaming anime. \u201cWhen he\u2019s not in a complete utter funk,\u201d she says, \u201cwe are cackling at each other, because we\u2019re both silly-billy stupid bitches.\u201d</p> \n<p>Survey data has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/16/us-trans-non-binary-youth-suicide-mental-health\">suggested</a> more than half of trans and nonbinary youth have considered suicide in the US, with increases in self-harm <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/26/health/trans-young-people-suicide-attempts/index.html\">linked</a> to anti-trans laws. Trans people disproportionately face <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8726680/\">housing insecurity</a> and related psychological distress.</p> \n<p>In August, Grimm put in his notice for his apartment, which he could no longer afford. His efforts to secure a voucher have so far been unsuccessful. And for the past month, he\u2019s stayed where he can, sometimes with friends or his mother, who took in Rascal. He\u2019s scared of homeless shelters, fearing discrimination. Some nights, he says, he finds himself sitting alone in a dog park.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Despite the federal appeals court ruling in Grimm\u2019s case that trans youth cannot be banned from bathrooms that match their gender, Virginia\u2019s Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/virginia-transgender-students-schools-youngkin-ba073a1e8a9286456a7509688f40115b\">rolled out policies</a> last year directing schools to do exactly that, with limited exceptions. He is part of a wave of GOP lawmakers across the US who have, in the lead-up to the election, prioritized making it harder for trans youth to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/29/gillian-branstetter-interview-transgender-rights\">play sports</a>, get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/29/south-carolina-aclu-trans-healthcare\">medical care</a>, have their <a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/leadership/pronouns-for-trans-nonbinary-students-the-states-with-laws-that-restrict-them-in-schools/2023/06\">pronouns</a> respected, use <a href=\"https://www.them.us/story/florida-trans-bathroom-law\">public facilities</a> and access LGBTQ+ <a href=\"https://www.lgbtmap.org/img/maps/citations-curricular-laws.pdf\">curriculum</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/24/missouri-trans-youth-anti-lgbtq-bills\">\u2018Legislators don\u2019t see me as human\u2019: Missouri trans youth fight to survive anti-LGBTQ+ bills</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Youngkin was yet another reminder of limits of the court process to secure meaningful progress, Grimm says.</p> \n<p>\u201cYoungkin knows if he flies in the face of the law, the only possible repercussion is going to be some poor queer justice group will have to scrape together the money for another lawsuit,\u201d Grimm says, noting that legal complaints carry the risk of increasingly conservative courts further eroding trans rights.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going backwards after working so hard, after Gavin suffered so much,\u201d says Deirdre, adding: \u201cIt makes me angry and sad, and makes me want to get everybody out to vote.\u201d</p> \n<p>Grimm says he sees voting for Democrats as \u201charm reduction\u201d, but he\u2019s disillusioned with mainstream liberals who refuse to take bold, proactive steps to fight back against the GOP\u2019s culture war.</p> \n<p>The Republican national convention was rife with cruel <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/rnc-speakers-lean-homophobic-transphobic-rhetoric-rcna162505\">attacks on trans people</a>. The Democratic convention, however, largely <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/dnc-2024-missed-trans-rights-implications-election-rcna167990\">avoided</a> the topic of trans rights, and no trans person spoke.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis system is built specifically to ensure the status quo continues, that people like me are disenfranchised, underrepresented and never have full equality under the law,\u201d Grimm says. \u201cBut I know that what I did was important. Even though the system is not going to serve our ultimate liberation, it is what we have in place right now.\u201d</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>These days, when he\u2019s not working to resolve his housing, Grimm volunteers with a climate justice group. He hopes to eventually pursue teaching. He\u2019s also worked to find queer community; in recent years, he\u2019s befriended Evan Hamilton, a 66-year-old trans man he met through a local LGBTQ+ group.</p> \n<p>Seated in Hamilton\u2019s garage, adorned with trans pride and weed flags, Grimm recalls their first meeting: \u201cEvan said, \u2018I\u2019m an old man you won\u2019t want to hang out with me.\u2019 But we\u2019re both autistic stoners who are trans, so we had a lot in common.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m kind of like his grandpa, but I\u2019ve learned a lot from him,\u201d says Hamilton, who transitioned in 2018, more than five decades after he declared he was a boy at age six and was rebuffed by family. \u201cI decided, screw \u2018if\u2019. I\u2019m going to be who I\u2019m supposed to be for what\u2019s left of my life. I felt like I had released all this stuff that had weighed me down.\u201d</p> \n<p>Grimm struggles to envision himself growing older, partly due to his personal crises and climate catastrophe, but also because of the \u201cutter invisibility\u201d of older trans men in media. His friendship with Hamilton has helped shift that.</p> \n<p>\u201cI hope to get to the ripe old age of, \u2018I don\u2019t give a shit any more,\u2019\u201d says Grimm. \u201cThere\u2019s a version of the future where I\u2019m this older gentleman. This relationship shows there\u2019s a whole lifespan waiting for me.\u201d</p>",

Seated in the back of a strip mall pub in Newport News, a midsize city in south-eastern Virginia, they recall the boys who spat on them at a pep rally and the time a popular senior threatened to beat up Grimm because he is transgender. \u201cWe were all misfits and leaned on each other,\u201d says Calin Lindberg, one of Grimm\u2019s oldest friends. \u201cThese people are part of my fucking soul,\u201d Grimm adds. The group over-enunciates one bully\u2019s name, joking he should be exposed. But they also express empathy for their tormentors \u2013 some later came out as queer and trans themselves. They direct more of their ire at the adults in their school system, who made Grimm\u2019s life a living hell. In 2014, the Gloucester county school board voted to ban Grimm, then 15, from using the boys\u2019 bathrooms, even though he\u2019d been living openly as a boy for months and using the restroom without incident. The policy turned deeply intimate facts of Grimm\u2019s life into a media spectacle. With the ACLU, he sued to defend his rights to use facilities that matched his gender, launching a groundbreaking national case on bathroom access. Grimm became an LGBTQ+ icon, celebrated by Laverne Cox at the Grammys and interviewed by Whoopi Goldberg on The View. He eventually won a landmark federal decision asserting trans youth\u2019s constitutional protections against discrimination. Advocates hoped the victory would squash the conservative movement\u2019s targeting of trans students. Instead, the climate for trans youth in the US has rapidly devolved as laws eroding their rights have been adopted in more than half of the country in recent years. Trans students have increasingly been banned from bathrooms and sports teams, barred from using their pronouns and names, and their existence has been ridiculed by Republican leaders and debated in news segments. And while Grimm became a civil rights trailblazer, the case did not secure him stability or financial security. The Pride parade invites have stopped coming, and like so many other marginalized trans people, Grimm has faced significant mental health challenges and struggles with poverty. He recently lost his housing, and is now facing homelessness. \u201cI\u2019m someone who has had worldwide visibility. I represent an outer crust of privilege most people will never see, and I cannot make ends meet no matter how hard I try,\u201d he says. *** Grimm had little confusion about who he was at a young age. He rejected girl\u2019s clothes, wanted his hair short and legs unshaven and despised the Baptist teachings of his family\u2019s church. He came out as lesbian at 13, but knew the label wasn\u2019t right. Once he learned being trans was a possibility, \u201cthere was no questioning phase,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was like seeing color for the first time.\u201d His mother, Deirdre Grimm, knew nothing about trans identity, and vaguely understood it as a \u201csin\u201d. But she read a book her son gave her, learning that affirming a trans kid can dramatically decrease their suicide risk. \u201cThat\u2019s all I needed to know,\u201d Deirdre says one morning in July, seated with her son in his apartment. She helped him choose his name and told the rest of the family before his 15th birthday party. Then she switched to an LGBTQ+-affirming church. \u201cSome parents of trans kids talk about this period of \u2018mourning the loss of their daughter\u2019, but I never went through any of that. He just became so much happier. He was also the same person \u2013 the kid who went out to help the homeless, the kid who liked to donate his birthday money.\u201d Much of his family rejected him, but many friends and teachers were supportive as he entered 10th grade as a boy and clearly more comfortable in his skin. He initially used a private nurse\u2019s restroom, but it was inconveniently located; peers and staff noted his long bathroom breaks, leaving him alienated and humiliated. So the principal and guidance counselor agreed to let him use the boys\u2019 restroom, and for two months, he had no issues. But gossip circulated outside school and on a community Facebook forum, where people posted vicious comments. Friends defending him online faced harassment. \u201cIt was the adults who made it a problem, because their mentality spread to their kids,\u201d recalls Evelyn Hronec, another friend. \u201cThese were grown adults talking about a 16-year-old\u2019s genitals. It was vile.\u201d At school board meetings in 2014, speakers stood feet away from Grimm, misgendering him, asking questions about his body and transition, calling him names and demanding he be kept out of boys\u2019 facilities in the name of \u201csafety\u201d. In one speech, Grimm pleaded for the opportunity to \u201cuse the restroom in peace\u201d. When a man called him a \u201cfreak\u201d and likened him to an animal, Deirdre lunged out of her seat, she recalls. \u201cI was fighting for his life.\u201d Pursuing a lawsuit, Grimm says now, was a way to reclaim his story. \u201cThere was nothing to be lost by standing up for myself. People already didn\u2019t like me or understand me. There already wasn\u2019t a place for me in society. I realized I could choose to make one or slink away. I was either going to live as the boy I was \u2013 or not at all.\u201d *** Grimm\u2019s case progressed at a time of rapid change for LGBTQ+ rights. In 2015, the US supreme court legalized gay marriage and conservative groups shifted focus to trans people, whipping up baseless fears about hypothetical \u201cmale predators\u201d in women\u2019s bathrooms. In 2016, North Carolina faced national scorn and costly boycotts for passing an anti-trans bathroom bill, which was later repealed. Grimm was a powerful antidote to the GOP\u2019s dehumanizing messaging, says Joshua Block, the ACLU lawyer who represented him: \u201cGavin\u2019s case really moved the conversation leaps and bounds forward for people\u2019s understanding of trans people, the harms of discrimination and the inanity of these exclusionary policies.\u201d As Donald Trump rolled back LGBTQ+ rights, including banning trans servicemembers from the military and authorizing homeless shelters to exclude trans people, Grimm won repeated court victories. But his school district appealed. One court of appeals judge compared Grimm to the historic American plaintiffs who challenged slavery, Japanese concentration camps, segregation and bans on interracial and gay marriage. A 2020 ruling offered a \u201cresounding yes\u201d in favor of the constitution and civil rights laws protecting trans students from discrimination. Grimm graduated before the case was resolved and never got to return to his school\u2019s boys\u2019 bathrooms. In 2021, the supreme court allowed Grimm\u2019s victory to stand, and the school board was ordered to pay $1.3m in attorney\u2019s fees. Grimm, however, only got a symbolic $1. To secure damages, Grimm would\u2019ve had to give the opposition\u2019s lawyers access to his medical records to scrutinize the cause and extent of his emotional distress, a process he couldn\u2019t stomach after years of fighting. The idea he\u2019d have to prove his anguish was unbelievable to his mom, who can\u2019t shake the memories of her son becoming suicidal. Grimm doesn\u2019t regret moving on without damages. But he desperately could\u2019ve used financial help \u2013 especially as the trauma of his childhood began to catch up with him. *** Inside his Newport News apartment one hot day in July, Grimm sits under a poster he recently hung on his wall celebrating the 19th birthday of his beloved cat, Rascal, whose array of photos is captioned: \u201cDoesn\u2019t look a day over 12!\u201d Grimm\u2019s life revolves around Rascal, he explains: \u201cIf I maintain housing while my cat is still alive, that\u2019s all I can really hope for. I\u2019m prepared to face homelessness, but I just don\u2019t want her to face it.\u201d His struggle to stay afloat escalated as his case ended. The networks he\u2019d built through the ACLU fight started to disappear, and his mental and physical health spiraled downward. Grimm has complex post-traumatic stress disorder and has suffered from stress-induced seizures that have affected his cognition and left him hospitalized in 2021. \u201cThe PTSD at its core is about not being safe or understood, being rejected, and the adults in my life not acting responsibly,\u201d he explains. \u201cIn high school, I was picked over and hyper-analyzed. I was tortured, harassed and bullied.\u201d He recalls a period when the stress was so severe he\u2019d dissociate as he walked down the hallway, not hearing his friends call his name. Grimm also has autism and struggles with sensory processing, and the combined impacts of his disabilities have prevented him from holding down a job or completing school, he says. He\u2019s relied on a GoFundMe and disability benefits, but has repeatedly struggled to make rent. His mother supports him but also has a tight income, he says. \u201cI don\u2019t have options \u2026 unless some rich gay philanthropist tosses me a crispy million.\u201d At times, he\u2019s felt disposable to the broader movement; he says it\u2019s hard not to think of notable gay rights plaintiffs who have not struggled to make ends meet after their victories. \u201cIt makes me so angry that it\u2019s so hard for him to find housing stability,\u201d says Camille Gibson, his best friend who moved to England and video calls him on a nearly daily basis. \u201cSome days, it\u2019s almost like he\u2019s short-circuiting because there\u2019s just so much stress.\u201d Still, the two find ways to have fun with each other from afar, often streaming anime. \u201cWhen he\u2019s not in a complete utter funk,\u201d she says, \u201cwe are cackling at each other, because we\u2019re both silly-billy stupid bitches.\u201d Survey data has suggested more than half of trans and nonbinary youth have considered suicide in the US, with increases in self-harm linked to anti-trans laws. Trans people disproportionately face housing insecurity and related psychological distress. In August, Grimm put in his notice for his apartment, which he could no longer afford. His efforts to secure a voucher have so far been unsuccessful. And for the past month, he\u2019s stayed where he can, sometimes with friends or his mother, who took in Rascal. He\u2019s scared of homeless shelters, fearing discrimination. Some nights, he says, he finds himself sitting alone in a dog park. *** Despite the federal appeals court ruling in Grimm\u2019s case that trans youth cannot be banned from bathrooms that match their gender, Virginia\u2019s Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, rolled out policies last year directing schools to do exactly that, with limited exceptions. He is part of a wave of GOP lawmakers across the US who have, in the lead-up to the election, prioritized making it harder for trans youth to play sports, get medical care, have their pronouns respected, use public facilities and access LGBTQ+ curriculum. Youngkin was yet another reminder of limits of the court process to secure meaningful progress, Grimm says. \u201cYoungkin knows if he flies in the face of the law, the only possible repercussion is going to be some poor queer justice group will have to scrape together the money for another lawsuit,\u201d Grimm says, noting that legal complaints carry the risk of increasingly conservative courts further eroding trans rights. \u201cWe\u2019re going backwards after working so hard, after Gavin suffered so much,\u201d says Deirdre, adding: \u201cIt makes me angry and sad, and makes me want to get everybody out to vote.\u201d Grimm says he sees voting for Democrats as \u201charm reduction\u201d, but he\u2019s disillusioned with mainstream liberals who refuse to take bold, proactive steps to fight back against the GOP\u2019s culture war. The Republican national convention was rife with cruel attacks on trans people. The Democratic convention, however, largely avoided the topic of trans rights, and no trans person spoke. \u201cThis system is built specifically to ensure the status quo continues, that people like me are disenfranchised, underrepresented and never have full equality under the law,\u201d Grimm says. \u201cBut I know that what I did was important. Even though the system is not going to serve our ultimate liberation, it is what we have in place right now.\u201d *** These days, when he\u2019s not working to resolve his housing, Grimm volunteers with a climate justice group. He hopes to eventually pursue teaching. He\u2019s also worked to find queer community; in recent years, he\u2019s befriended Evan Hamilton, a 66-year-old trans man he met through a local LGBTQ+ group. Seated in Hamilton\u2019s garage, adorned with trans pride and weed flags, Grimm recalls their first meeting: \u201cEvan said, \u2018I\u2019m an old man you won\u2019t want to hang out with me.\u2019 But we\u2019re both autistic stoners who are trans, so we had a lot in common.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m kind of like his grandpa, but I\u2019ve learned a lot from him,\u201d says Hamilton, who transitioned in 2018, more than five decades after he declared he was a boy at age six and was rebuffed by family. \u201cI decided, screw \u2018if\u2019. I\u2019m going to be who I\u2019m supposed to be for what\u2019s left of my life. I felt like I had released all this stuff that had weighed me down.\u201d Grimm struggles to envision himself growing older, partly due to his personal crises and climate catastrophe, but also because of the \u201cutter invisibility\u201d of older trans men in media. His friendship with Hamilton has helped shift that. \u201cI hope to get to the ripe old age of, \u2018I don\u2019t give a shit any more,\u2019\u201d says Grimm. \u201cThere\u2019s a version of the future where I\u2019m this older gentleman. This relationship shows there\u2019s a whole lifespan waiting for me.\u201d",

Erik and Lyle Men\u00e9ndez have been in prison since their 1996 conviction in the killings of their parents, Jos\u00e9 and Kitty, in 1989. The fatal shooting of a prominent entertainment executive and his wife in Beverly Hills, at the hands of their own children, captured international attention three decades ago \u2013 their first trial was televised by Court TV \u2013 and has reached a new generation thanks to social media and numerous TV dramas and documentaries.

Earlier this month, George Gasc\u00f3n, the LA district attorney, said his office would review new evidence and decide whether the case should be considered for resentencing or a new trial. The new evidence includes a letter written by Erik Men\u00e9ndez that his attorneys say corroborates the allegations that he had been sexually abused by his father as well as allegations from a former member of the boy band Menudo who said that Jos\u00e9 Men\u00e9ndez, previously an executive at RCA records, had sexually abused him.

      "body": "<h2>Being dangerously thin is in again</h2> <p>Ladies, have you been waiting with bated breath for an association of plastic surgeons to tell you what your body should look like this season? Have you lost sleep wondering whether your waist is on trend or not? Are you worried that your hips, which don\u2019t lie, might be a little too 2005?</p> <p>Well, you are in luck! The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) have put their beautiful Botoxed heads together and decreed that we are entering the \u201cballet body\u201d era. In a recently <a href=\"https://www.plasticsurgery.org/news/press-releases/plastic-surgery-sees-steady-growth-amidst-economic-uncertainty-american-society-of-plastic-surgeons-2023-procedural-statistics-report-finds\">published annual report</a> that analyzed procedures done in 2023, the world\u2019s largest plastic surgery organization noted that demand for an ideal \u201cballet body\u201d is driving interest in liposuction and breast enhancement. Since ballet is notorious for <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9955284/#:~:text=Recent%20studies%20have%20indicated%20a,dancers%20%5B17%2C25%5D.\">eating disorders</a>, one imagines it might also drive an increase in women starving themselves.</p> <p>\u201cThere really has been almost a decade of \u2018more curves are better\u2019, and really glorifying those,\u201d the ASPS president, Steven Williams, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/10/01/ballet-body-trend-thinness-athletic/\">told the Washington Post</a> in an interview last week. \u201cAnd now it seems like we\u2019re taking a bit of an abrupt turn to something a little bit more slim.\u201d</p> <p>While it might be abrupt, the turn hasn\u2019t come completely out of nowhere. For a few years now, there has been a steady drip-drip of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/13/skinniness-is-back-in-fashion-but-did-it-ever-really-go-away\">articles in the style press</a> exclaiming that skinniness is back in fashion, that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2022/10/internet-thin-culture-is-back.html\">thin is in</a>\u201d. The Kardashians, it will not surprise you to hear, seem to have played an oversized role in shifting body-related discourse. While Kim Kardashian has always denied getting a Brazilian butt lift (BBL), she has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/feb/09/brazilian-butt-lift-worlds-most-dangerous-cosmetic-surgery\">credited</a> with driving massive uptake of the posterior-enhancing procedure over the past decade. Then, in 2022, she gushed about going <a href=\"https://www.glamour.com/story/kim-kardashian-2022-met-gala-diet-stunt-alarming\">on an extreme diet</a> in order to fit into Marilyn Monroe\u2019s dress for the Met gala, which seemed to help encourage a new cultural obsession with thinness.</p> <p>I\u2019m not blaming all the world\u2019s woes on the Kardashians, to be clear. The fashion industry as a whole has started glamorizing thinness. Vogue Business released a new <a href=\"https://www.voguebusiness.com/story/fashion/the-vogue-business-spring-summer-2025-size-inclusivity-report\">size-inclusivity report</a> on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/oct/11/fashion-experts-raise-concern-about-return-to-using-extremely-thin-models\">and said</a>: \u201cWe are facing a worrying return to using extremely thin models\u201d with \u201ca plateau in size inclusivity efforts across New York, London, Milan and Paris\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a decrease in size across the board and that includes already straight-size models,\u201d one fashion insider <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/oct/11/fashion-experts-raise-concern-about-return-to-using-extremely-thin-models\">told the Guardian</a> this week. \u201cA lot of models that used to be plus-size are now mid-size.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the shrinking models may have had a little medical help. The rise of the \u201cballet body\u201d comes amid a boom in anti-obesity drugs like Ozempic (which was originally developed to treat diabetes). Numerous celebrities, including the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Elon Musk, have <a href=\"https://www.today.com/health/celebrities-on-ozempic-rcna129740\">talked openly</a> about taking semaglutide (the active ingredient in drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy) for weight loss. Some celebrities are even cashing in on the trend: Kourtney Kardashian Barker has launched a wellness brand that is selling <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/kourtney-kardashian-barker-lemme-glp1\">what has been described</a> as an Ozempic-style supplement.</p> <p>The obsession with Ozempic has now reached such a fever pitch that some politicians are including it in their campaign promises. Eduardo Paes, the current mayor of Rio de Janeiro, recently promised to make a generic version of the medication widely available if he wins re-election. Paes told the Brazilian newspaper Extra that he lost <a href=\"https://extra.globo.com/politica/jurema/noticia/2024/10/eduardo-paes-perde-30-quilos-com-ozempic-e-quer-distribuir-medicamento-o-rio-nao-vai-ter-mais-gordinho.ghtml\">66 pounds</a> on Ozempic and wanted to introduce it to the public health system. \u201cRio will be a city where there will be no more fat people. Everyone will be taking Ozempic at family clinics,\u201d Paes said according to a translation of the <a href=\"https://qz.com/ozempic-rio-mayor-eduardo-paes-1851664654\">original interview by Quartz</a>.</p> <p>Drugs like Ozempic can obviously be incredibly valuable for people who need to lose weight for health reasons. But a cultural shift towards idolizing \u201cballet bodies\u201d coupled with this new category of weight-loss drugs is a dangerous combination. Doctors are already seeing people who shouldn\u2019t be using these medications (and who have often got hold of them via online pharmacies) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/13/top-doctor-warns-against-using-anti-obesity-drugs-to-get-beach-body-ready\">presenting with serious symptoms</a> because of inappropriate use. The writing has been on the wall for a while, but now it feels like the body-positivity era is officially over and we are back to a world where women are dying to be thin.</p> <h2>The world narrowly escaped a Virginia Woolf Barbie</h2> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/07/a-virginia-woolf-barbie-is-this-really-the-most-inappropriate-doll-of-all-time\">Woolf\u2019s great-niece</a>, Virginia Nicholson, Mattel was interested in creating a doll based on the late writer but her estate was vehemently against it.

      "bodyText": "Being dangerously thin is in again Ladies, have you been waiting with bated breath for an association of plastic surgeons to tell you what your body should look like this season? Have you lost sleep wondering whether your waist is on trend or not? Are you worried that your hips, which don\u2019t lie, might be a little too 2005? Well, you are in luck! The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) have put their beautiful Botoxed heads together and decreed that we are entering the \u201cballet body\u201d era. In a recently published annual report that analyzed procedures done in 2023, the world\u2019s largest plastic surgery organization noted that demand for an ideal \u201cballet body\u201d is driving interest in liposuction and breast enhancement. Since ballet is notorious for eating disorders, one imagines it might also drive an increase in women starving themselves. \u201cThere really has been almost a decade of \u2018more curves are better\u2019, and really glorifying those,\u201d the ASPS president, Steven Williams, told the Washington Post in an interview last week. \u201cAnd now it seems like we\u2019re taking a bit of an abrupt turn to something a little bit more slim.\u201d While it might be abrupt, the turn hasn\u2019t come completely out of nowhere. For a few years now, there has been a steady drip-drip of articles in the style press exclaiming that skinniness is back in fashion, that \u201cthin is in\u201d. The Kardashians, it will not surprise you to hear, seem to have played an oversized role in shifting body-related discourse. While Kim Kardashian has always denied getting a Brazilian butt lift (BBL), she has been credited with driving massive uptake of the posterior-enhancing procedure over the past decade. Then, in 2022, she gushed about going on an extreme diet in order to fit into Marilyn Monroe\u2019s dress for the Met gala, which seemed to help encourage a new cultural obsession with thinness. I\u2019m not blaming all the world\u2019s woes on the Kardashians, to be clear. The fashion industry as a whole has started glamorizing thinness. Vogue Business released a new size-inclusivity report on Tuesday and said: \u201cWe are facing a worrying return to using extremely thin models\u201d with \u201ca plateau in size inclusivity efforts across New York, London, Milan and Paris\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s been a decrease in size across the board and that includes already straight-size models,\u201d one fashion insider told the Guardian this week. \u201cA lot of models that used to be plus-size are now mid-size.\u201d Some of the shrinking models may have had a little medical help. The rise of the \u201cballet body\u201d comes amid a boom in anti-obesity drugs like Ozempic (which was originally developed to treat diabetes). Numerous celebrities, including the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Elon Musk, have talked openly about taking semaglutide (the active ingredient in drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy) for weight loss. Some celebrities are even cashing in on the trend: Kourtney Kardashian Barker has launched a wellness brand that is selling what has been described as an Ozempic-style supplement. The obsession with Ozempic has now reached such a fever pitch that some politicians are including it in their campaign promises. Eduardo Paes, the current mayor of Rio de Janeiro, recently promised to make a generic version of the medication widely available if he wins re-election. Paes told the Brazilian newspaper Extra that he lost 66 pounds on Ozempic and wanted to introduce it to the public health system. \u201cRio will be a city where there will be no more fat people. Everyone will be taking Ozempic at family clinics,\u201d Paes said according to a translation of the original interview by Quartz. Drugs like Ozempic can obviously be incredibly valuable for people who need to lose weight for health reasons. But a cultural shift towards idolizing \u201cballet bodies\u201d coupled with this new category of weight-loss drugs is a dangerous combination. Doctors are already seeing people who shouldn\u2019t be using these medications (and who have often got hold of them via online pharmacies) presenting with serious symptoms because of inappropriate use. The writing has been on the wall for a while, but now it feels like the body-positivity era is officially over and we are back to a world where women are dying to be thin. The world narrowly escaped a Virginia Woolf Barbie According to Woolf\u2019s great-niece, Virginia Nicholson, Mattel was interested in creating a doll based on the late writer but her estate was vehemently against it. The rejected doll apparently looked like a \u201cLaura Ashley milk maid with a sweet hair bun holding an accessory copy of Mrs Dalloway\u201d. One imagines the doll\u2019s accessories also included a room of her own. Melania Trump says King Charles is her pen pal According to Melania\u2019s new memoir, she exchanges letters with King Charles \u201cto this day\u201d. What on earth do they talk about? How to avoid your taxes? Their favourite gold trinkets? To be honest, I really don\u2019t care, do u? Donald Trump continues to attempt to woo women by calling them \u2018dumb\u2019 While Melania sits at her desk writing long letters to the king of the United Kingdom, her husband is continuing to tour the United States yelling about how stupid women are. During a recent rally, Trump touched on Kamala Harris\u2019s appearance on Alex Cooper\u2019s Call Her Daddy, a podcast that is extremely popular with young woman. \u201cI think the other one asking the question[s] is dumber than Kamala. [Cooper is] a dummy,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019ve watched her over the years. That is one dumb \u2013 that is one dumb woman. Sorry, I\u2019m sorry, women, she\u2019s a dummy.\u201d So there you go, the man who recently promised that he \u201cWILL PROTECT WOMEN AT A LEVEL NEVER SEEN BEFORE\u201d, wants you to know that successful women are actually really dumb. The situation for pregnant women in Gaza is catastrophic \u201cMore than 500,000 women have lost access to vital services like pre-and postnatal care, family planning and treatment for infections; over 17,000 pregnant women are in severe stages of hunger,\u201d according to a UN News report. The suffering is unimaginable and there is no end in sight. More than 370 million girls and women globally subjected to sexual assault as children One in eight girls and women alive today experienced rape or sexual assault before the age of 18, according to shocking new Unicef estimates. The week in pawtriarchy A strong contender for the 2024 Nightmare Neighbor of the Year award goes to an anonymous woman in Washington who had been feeding wild raccoons in her yard for the last few decades.

There were reports the company had pulled out of the summit, where it was expected to announce a \u00a31bn investment in the UK, after the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, called for a boycott of P&amp;O. On Saturday the Department of Business and Trade confirmed DP World will attend. Earlier, Keir Starmer rebuked Haigh for her comments, in which she described the firm as a \u201crogue operator\u201d. Announcing new worker protections, Haigh said on Wednesday that she had boycotted the ferry company and told the Department for Transport not to have any dealings with either it or its owning group. Shortly after her comments, DP World, the Dubai-based owner of P&amp;O Ferries, put the announcement of a reported \u00a31bn investment in the UK on hold. \u201cI think we\u2019ll resolve that,\u201d the prime minister told the BBC\u2019s Newscast podcast. The announcement of plans by DP World to expand its London Gateway port was expected to be a key part of the Labour government\u2019s summit.

Kamala Harris was a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/story/kamala-harris-chappell-roan-femininomenon\">femininomenon</a>\u201d, electrifying a high-stakes presidential race that many of the country\u2019s youngest voters had been dreading: a rematch between the two oldest candidates in American history.</p> \n<p>Chartreuse-blocked memes and coconut emojis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/25/kamala-harris-tiktok-memes\">filled</a> social media feeds. The tidal wave of young \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/27/kamala-harris-young-voters-israel-gaza-jayapal\">Kamalove</a>\u201d sparked a rush of small-dollar donations and volunteer sign-ups for her days-old campaign. For an extremely online generation of young Democrats, the vibes were <em>so</em> good.</p> \n<p>On the ground in St Louis, a cadre of young progressives were gathering for an entirely different election \u2013 one with virtually no bearing on the balance of power in Washington, but one they believed mattered deeply. There in Missouri\u2019s first congressional district, representative Cori Bush was fighting for her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/03/cori-bush-wesley-bell-missouri-election\">political survival</a>.</p> \n<p>Many of the twentysomethings had traveled from out of state, sacrificing summer jobs and sleeping on yoga mats to campaign for Bush in the sticky August heat. \u201cWe just stopped our lives and went to St Louis,\u201d said John Paul Mejia, a 22-year-old student and climate activist.</p> \n<p>Mejia was there as part of Protect Our Power (Pop), a youth coalition that came together earlier this year for what he described as a \u201cDavid-and-Goliath\u201d mission to defend leftwing members of Congress against a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/20/pro-israel-groups-gaza-us-elections\">well-funded effort</a> to unseat them.</p> \n<p>To them,<strong> </strong>Bush, the nurse turned racial justice activist, was one of the few elected leaders who shared their sense of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/29/cori-bush-interview-midterms-abortion\">urgency</a> about everything from the country\u2019s affordability crisis to safeguarding abortion access.</p> \n<p>As a newly elected member of Congress, Bush had slept on the steps of the US Capitol to protest against the expiration of a federal eviction moratorium. The action paid off: the Biden administration extended the pause. In warning about the threat to reproductive rights, Bush <a href=\"https://x.com/cspan/status/1443592081218277381?lang=en\">testified</a> before a House panel that she had had an abortion at 18 after becoming pregnant by rape. In 2023, she emerged as one of the strongest critics of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, a stance that reflected a groundswell of <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/10/05/gen-z-israel-pro-palestinian-protests\">youth dissent</a> but ultimately imperiled her congressional career.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s pretty much nobody else, even members of Congress who are closer to our age, in some instances, who actually represent what our generation cares about,\u201d Vincent Vertuccio, a 21-year-old college student and an activist with Pop, said of the progressive Squad members. \u201cIf we lose these people, even one or two, it\u2019s a direct diminishment of our power.\u201d</p> \n<p>On the morning of the election, as the group made a final push to get out the vote, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/06/kamala-harris-running-mate-tim-walz\">news broke</a> that Harris, to their delight, had chosen the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/11/tim-walz-evolution\">progressive midwestern governor</a> Tim Walz as her running mate. From the trenches of a hard-fought campaign, they spared a moment to celebrate what felt like a win.</p> \n<p>That night, Bush <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/07/cori-bush-pro-israel-lobby-warning\">lost</a> her re-election bid in a primary contest decided by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/06/us/elections/results-missouri-us-house-1-primary.html\">fewer</a> than 7,000 votes.</p> \n<p>The defeat stung. Pop had run a scrappy campaign: its volunteers collectively placed 120,000 phone calls and knocked on more than 20,000 doors. But they were up against a torrent of outside spending, primarily by pro-Israel groups, that transformed the race into one of the <a href=\"https://x.com/AdImpact_Pol/status/1816200736054624582\">most</a> expensive House primaries in US history.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are feeling the issues really hard, but I don\u2019t think that they\u2019re feeling people fighting for them equally as hard,\u201d Mejia reflected afterward. \u201cThat worries me, especially at a time when we\u2019re also facing a crisis of democracy.\u201d</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<h2>Gen Z poised to play decisive role?</h2> \n<p>In interviews with dozens of activists, organizers and candidates working to build youth political power on the left, a portrait emerged of a generation fed up with the status quo in Washington but eager to flex its electoral might this cycle. Many are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/24/kamala-harris-gen-z-voters\">genuinely enthusiastic</a> about the prospect of a Harris presidency. Others hope she will be a bulwark against Republican extremism, if not the transformational figure they crave.</p> \n<p>With the presidential candidates offering sharply contrasting visions for the economy, abortion, climate change, foreign policy and democracy itself, there is an understanding among young liberals that the outcome could have profound, generational implications for the country \u2013 and the planet.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are going to be the margin of victory,\u201d said Marianna Pecora, the 20-year-old communications director of<a href=\"https://votersoftomorrow.org/\"> Voters of Tomorrow</a><strong>,</strong> a gen Z-led group working to mobilize first-time voters and students. As the race moves into its final stretch, her closing pitch is direct: \u201cDon\u2019t let this election happen to you.\u201d</p> \n<p>Approximately 41 million members of gen Z will be <a href=\"https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/41-million-members-gen-z-will-be-eligible-vote-2024\">eligible to vote</a> in November, including millions who were too young to vote in the 2020 election. Their participation could be decisive: the presidential contest is deadlocked, probably hinging on tens of thousands of votes in a handful of swing states, and the battle for control of Congress is as close as ever.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/aug/07/gen-z-voters-political-ideology-gender-gap\">Young women are the most progressive group in American history.

In 2020, they turned out in <a href=\"https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/half-youth-voted-2020-11-point-increase-2016\">force</a> to defeat Donald Trump, only to witness the 45th president refuse to concede and his far-right allies attempt to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s victory by force.</p> \n<p>A growing body of <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/commissions/youth-mental-health\">research suggests</a> that rising economic inequality, climate change and technological advancements are taking a toll on young people\u2019s mental health, leading to <a href=\"https://www.waltonfamilyfoundation.org/stories/foundation/generation-z-is-waging-a-battle-against-depression-addiction-and-hopelessness\">high levels of anxiety</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf\">loneliness</a>. A recent<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25085416-nbc-news-stay-tuned-gen-z-poll-topline-results-9424\"> NBC News poll </a>of gen Z adults found that nearly half expect life for their generation to be \u201cworse than previous generations\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a feeling of vulnerability and isolation \u2013 that there\u2019s no one really representing their interests, particularly politically,\u201d said Daniel Cox, director of the <a href=\"https://www.americansurveycenter.org/\">Survey Center on American Life at the American Enterprise Institute</a> (AEI). \u201cWhere you have a lot of young women becoming more active in politics because of that, particularly progressive women, a lot of men are just withdrawing completely, whether it\u2019s dating, politics or work.\u201d</p> \n<p>Surveys indicate that both young men and young women favor Harris over Trump. But the youth gender gap is striking. In a <a href=\"https://iop.harvard.edu/youth-poll/48th-edition-fall-2024\">youth poll</a> released by Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Institute of Politics, Harris led Trump by 47 percentage points among young women, compared with 17 percentage points among young men.</p> \n<p>The gulf-wide \u2013 and growing \u2013 divide reflects a dynamic that is shaping the 2024 election and could have lasting implications for both political parties: young women have <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/649826/exploring-young-women-leftward-expansion.aspx\">become more liberal</a>, as young men <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/aug/05/young-men-voters-us-election-trump-harris\">drift away</a> from the Democratic party.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/aug/05/young-men-voters-us-election-trump-harris\">Young men in the US used to lean left. Could they now hand Trump the presidency?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There is virtually no doubt that Harris will win more young voters than Trump in November, but the margin will matter greatly.</p> \n<p>For decades, Democrats have dominated the youth vote, with voters aged 18 to 29 favoring Biden by 24 percentage points in 2020, according to <a href=\"https://circle.tufts.edu/2020-election-center\">Tufts University\u2019s Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (Circle)</a>. While young people have historically voted at lower rates than older adults, that trend may be <a href=\"https://circle.tufts.edu/research-areas/broadening-youth-voting\">starting to change.</a></p> \n<p>Youth voter turnout rose to 50% in 2020, <a href=\"https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/half-youth-voted-2020-11-point-increase-2016\">probably a modern record</a> and a <a href=\"https://circle.tufts.edu/2020-election-center\">remarkable 11-point increase</a> from the 2016 presidential election, according to a Circle analysis. Young voters of color, it found, played a particularly \u201c<a href=\"https://circle.tufts.edu/2020-election-center\">instrumental</a>\u201d role in Biden\u2019s victories in closely contested battlegrounds such as Georgia, Pennsylvania and Arizona.</p> \n<p>Two years later, young people again voted <a href=\"https://circle.tufts.edu/2022-election-center\">at high levels</a> during the congressional midterms. Their fury over the supreme court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v Wade <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/12/us/young-voter-turnout-election-democrats.html\">was credited</a> with helping Democrats defy historical expectations.</p> \n<p>Young voters are once again poised to play a potentially decisive role this election, said Melissa Deckman, CEO of Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) and author of the forthcoming book <a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-politics-of-gen-z/9780231560085\">The Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape Our Democracy</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen there\u2019s an issue that gen Z is passionate about,\u201d she said, \u201cthey\u2019re willing to engage, despite \u2013 or maybe because of \u2013 the fact that institutions aren\u2019t necessarily addressing their concerns.\u201d</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<h2>From youth activism to youth votes</h2> \n<p>For a segment of gen Z, youth activism has practically become a rite of passage.</p> \n<p>Rather than despair, many young people mobilized in response to the election of Trump, to school shootings that killed classmates, to the climate crisis, which they believe too many of their leaders still ignore, episodes of police brutality captured on video, the rising tide of post-pandemic book bans and anti-LGBTQ+ laws, a bloody Middle East war playing out in real time on their phones, and the loss of federal abortion protections that has left young women with fewer rights than their grandmothers.</p> \n<p>\u201cPerhaps the most important, consistent finding over 25 years of analyzing young voters \u2013 the most significant predictor of youth participation \u2013 is that young people participate when they can see a tangible difference in the process,\u201d said John Della Volpe, director of polling at Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics and the author of <a href=\"https://www.harvard.com/book/9781250875518\">Fight: How Gen Z Is Channeling Their Fear and Passion to Save America</a>.</p> \n<p>This generation of activists, the first born after the release of the smartphone, blends traditional methods of activism \u2013 like old-school marches and campus protests \u2013 with modern digital strategies such as TikTok <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/style/tiktok-trump-rally-tulsa.html\">trolls</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220928-the-surprising-power-of-internet-memes\">internet memes</a>. But even more, what makes their activism unique, researchers say, is the way they have translated youth protest into youth voter participation.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen the oldest members of gen Z turned voting age, they carried those values forward and voted at rates that previous generations have not even touched,\u201d Della Volpe said.</p> \n<p>Despite their low confidence in American institutions, Della Volpe said gen Z, including <a href=\"https://iop.harvard.edu/youth-poll/47th-edition-spring-2024\">young men</a>, tend to be <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/05/14/on-the-cusp-of-adulthood-and-facing-an-uncertain-future-what-we-know-about-gen-z-so-far/\">pro-government</a>. As a cohort, they are more likely than older Americans to say that the federal government should \u2013 and must \u2013 do more to address the country\u2019s problems.</p> \n<p>Some young people, like Ben Braver, a 22-year-old public school teacher near Tampa, Florida, aren\u2019t waiting for their elected elders to act.</p> \n<p>Braver, who shares earnest <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@benbraverfl\">explainer videos</a> on TikTok making the case for progressive policies, is running for a seat in the Florida state senate. He decided to challenge his Republican opponent, the incumbent state senator, after he <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/03/florida-abortion-ban-desantis-00014102\">voted</a> for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/02/florida-abortion-ban-six-weeks#:~:text=On%20Monday%2C%20the%20Florida%20state,takes%20effect%20on%201%20May.\">Florida\u2019s six-week abortion ban</a> that took effect earlier this year.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to wait until 2040, when we\u2019re already the majority. We have to start now,\u201d Braver said. \u201cWe need people writing policy that they\u2019ll have to live under.\u201d</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<h2>Building power in a right-leaning structure</h2> \n<p>Santiago Mayer emigrated from Mexico to the US as a teenager in 2017, arriving in the heady months after Trump took office.</p> \n<p>At his new high school in southern California, he was shocked to learn that many of his classmates were mostly tuned out. Trump, who ran for president on a fiercely anti-immigrant platform, had just implemented a travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim countries and was pushing Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf young people had voted in 2016, we might have been able to avoid the Trump administration,\u201d Mayer, now 22, observed.</p> \n<p>At the time, the teen turned to \u201cpre-Elon\u201d Twitter. His unfiltered anti-Trump musings gathered a following and in 2019, his handle, Voters of Tomorrow, graduated from a Twitter account to an official political engagement organization \u201cfor gen Z, by gen Z\u201d \u2013 just in time to help drive Trump from office. \u201cThey pissed off the wrong generation,\u201d emerged as a rallying cry.</p> \n<p>Mayer\u2019s team became enthusiastic boosters of the Biden administration. They worked to translate the president\u2019s sprawling, sometimes wonky, achievements on climate, gun control and student loan debt for a generation <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/news-platform-fact-sheet/?tabItem=8b137657-9961-4130-a811-20f854ea2321\">increasingly turns to social media</a> for its news.</p> \n<p>But over the course of Biden\u2019s term, many young people grew disenchanted with the 81-year-old president, harboring reservations about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/17/us-uncommitted-voters-biden-gaza\">his foreign policy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/05/us/elections/times-siena-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html\">age</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cYoung people want to vote for someone who\u2019s going to shake the system,\u201d Link Lauren, a young, right-leaning TikTok influencer who worked on Robert F Kennedy\u2019s independent presidential campaign, said in an interview this summer. \u201cThey want disruption.\u201d</p> \n<p>Early polls showed <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/24125496/young-voters-trump-biden-polling\">Trump performing far better</a> with this voting bloc than he had in 2020 and, in <a href=\"https://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NPR_PBS-NewsHour_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_202403291554.pdf\">some</a> cases, drawing even with \u2013 or doing better than \u2013 Biden. The numbers sent shockwaves through the Democratic party. Was gen Z turning Maga?</p> \n<p>Analysts and organizers, Mayer included, were skeptical. Gen Z, after all, was <a href=\"https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/trends?category=Politics&amp;measure=polviews_r&amp;Measure%20Category=Liberal&amp;Breakdown%20Label=Age%C2%B0\">more socially liberal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/generation-z-and-the-transformation-of-american-adolescence-how-gen-zs-formative-experiences-shape-its-politics-priorities-and-future/\">less religious</a>, more educated and <a href=\"https://www.prri.org/research/generation-zs-views-on-generational-change-and-the-challenges-and-opportunities-ahead-a-political-and-cultural-glimpse-into-americas-future/\">more likely to identify as LGBTQ+</a> than previous generations. Rather, they saw the numbers as a pulse check: young people were frustrated by the state of the post-pandemic economy, by the slow pace of change in Washington and, yes, by the prospect of a contest between the same (very) old candidates who had dominated much of gen Z\u2019s political memory.</p> \n<p>Mayer identified a deeper tension: a left-leaning generation was trying to build power within a political system that <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/09/19/how-americans-view-proposals-to-change-the-political-system/\">seemed to structurally</a> bend rightward.</p> \n<p>With Biden as president, there had been an expectation that he would guard against Republican threats to the environment, abortion access, voting rights and gun control. But then the most conservative supreme court in history stepped in and eroded those protections while raising the possibility that other rights could be next.</p> \n<p>Gerrymandering has made the US House <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2022/feb/12/us-redistricting-house-seats-safe-competitive-districts?utm_source=pocket_mylist\">less competitive</a>, harder to govern and <a href=\"https://time.com/collection-post/4527291/2016-election-gerrymandering/\">more polarized</a> while an arcane Senate rule known as the filibuster stands in the way of most major legislation. Beyond Washington, the country is increasingly cracked into red states and blue states with dramatically different laws governing abortion access, LGBTQ+ protections and union membership.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen you see kids gunned down in schools, then the supreme court says domestic abusers can have guns and your abortion rights are gone, it creates a sense of hopelessness,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cIt feels like the government is working against you.\u201d</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<h2>The coconut army</h2> \n<p>The mood among young Democrats changed entirely on 21 July, when the octogenarian president exited the race and threw his support behind Harris, who, at 59, seemed positively youthful by comparison.</p> \n<p>Marion Smart, a 21-year-old student organizer with Voters of Tomorrow\u2019s Georgia chapter, was preparing to welcome hundreds of liberal students and activists to the group\u2019s Year of Youth summit in Atlanta when it happened.</p> \n<p>Summit-goers descended on Atlanta\u2019s Loudermilk center days later, chugging boxes of coconut water as they dashed between a panel on running for office as a member of gen Z and a training led by a <a href=\"https://x.com/OrganizerMemes?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">panda head-wearing digital organizer</a>.</p> \n<p>Harris\u2019s nascent campaign sent an envoy, Eve Levenson, the national youth engagement director, and the vice-president herself took time in the whirlwind of her elevation to record a pre-taped message, in which she vowed to work for their vote.</p> \n<p>In response, they pledged to turn out the youth vote. \u201cWe\u2019re all part of the coconut army and we\u2019re gonna take this election by storm,\u201d Smart said.</p> \n<p>Ashleigh Ewald, the group\u2019s Georgia state director, felt the political ground shift immediately. She had toiled for months on college campuses around the state, trying to convince her discontented peers to get involved in the November election. Now they were seeking her out, asking how they could help.</p> \n<p>\u201cBecause of Kamala Harris, that pessimism turned into enthusiasm,\u201d the 22-year-old said.</p> \n<p>Gen z voters have flocked to the vice-president, <a href=\"https://x.com/MeetThePress/status/1837839352509898849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1837839352509898849%7Ctwgr%5Ede471272944ae3812e73a6341659b6603af01098%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedailybeast.com%2Fkamala-harris-has-biggest-favorability-jump-since-george-w-bush-after-911\">helping to drive up her popularity</a>.But Harris\u2019s ground-breaking candidacy \u2013 she would be the first woman to serve as president of the United States \u2013 has particularly energized young women. After she entered the race, youth voter registration among young women rose sharply \u2013 a trend one Democratic data analyst dubbed <a href=\"https://x.com/tbonier/status/1828457890228629534\">the \u201cHarris effect.\u201d</a></p> \n<p>Nearly six in 10 women under age 30 view her potential presidency as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/the-politics-of-progress-and-privilege-how-americas-gender-gap-is-reshaping-the-2024-election/\">very important</a>\u201d milestone in American political history, according to a national survey by AEI\u2019s Survey Center on American Life. The sentiment is notably more pronounced for younger women than it is for older women and significantly more than for younger men.</p> \n<p>Leaving a \u201ccontingency planning\u201d workshop for a potential Trump victory, Amini Bonane said the session had been a sobering reminder of the stakes this election. It was part of the reason Bonane, a 29-year-old community organizer who came to the US as a refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo, decided to <a href=\"https://www.aminiforfairfax.com/\">run for a seat on the city council</a> in her home town of Fairfax, Virginia. With Harris as the nominee, she has felt a surge of energy in her own race.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just so excited and \u2013 hello! \u2013 I\u2019ll be on the same ballot as,\u201d she paused, shaking her hands in excitement, \u201cpossibly the first Black woman Potus. That is just so motivating for me.\u201d</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<h2>Courting gen Z</h2> \n<p>The online hype that followed Harris\u2019s sudden emergence was not only good for the vibes. It helped reset the entire political narrative around her, propelling the once-unpopular vice president into what her campaign playfully coined its \u201cKamala era\u201d.</p> \n<p>Conservative media outlets had long amplified Harris\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/25/kamala-harris-speaking-style-memes\">quirky</a> turns of phrase \u2013derided as \u201cword salads\u201d \u2013 and her <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/kamala-harris-laugh-criticism-trump-women-color-emotions-rcna164069\">laugh</a> to portray her as unserious. Young supporters reinterpreted those same clips as charming and authentic \u2013 a powerful currency in contemporary politics. </p> \n<p>Harris\u2019s campaign has nodded back, embracing the viral trends on her gen Z-run TikTok, @kamalahq. It eclipses Trump\u2019s personal account, @realdonaldtrump, in engagement, though he has substantially more followers. During a youth voter drive last month, Harris said young voters were part of the reason she was so optimistic about the future.</p> \n<p>\u201cYour generation is killing it,\u201d she said on a call with gen Z organizers. \u201cYou\u2019re brilliant. You care. You\u2019re impatient in every incredible, good way.\u201d</p> \n<p>To offset Harris\u2019s steep advantage with young women, Trump has been<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/aug/05/young-men-voters-us-election-trump-harris\"> heavily courting</a> gen Z\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/09/09/trump-gen-z-vote-right-wing-influencers-podcasts/75081942007/\">bro</a>\u201d vote with amped up displays of masculinity. He has turned up at Ultimate Fighting Championship bouts and a college <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ron-desantis-iowa-iowa-state-football-game-f398a634ce11048c5e49b207263994c2\">fraternity house</a>. Wrestler Hulk Hogan tore off his shirt during a speech at the Republican convention in which he praised Trump as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5124673/hulk-hogan\">gladiator</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>The former president has appeared on shows with the controversial YouTuber <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/19/trump-harris-young-men-voters/?itid=lk_inline_manual_42\">Logan Paul</a> and video game streamer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/06/trump-adin-ross-tesla-rolex\">Adin Ross</a>, both of whom attract sizable followings of gen Z men. The Nelk Boys, a group of online content creators and pranksters, are helping too, by <a href=\"https://sendthevote.com/\">spearheading</a> a voter registration initiative on Trump\u2019s behalf. His team is also relying on Turning Point Action, the political advocacy wing of the far-right youth organization Turning Point USA, to drive out young conservatives.</p> \n<p>The Harris campaign and allied youth groups, meanwhile, are <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/08/27/nx-s1-5090804/harris-gen-z-voters\">aggressively targeting</a> college students \u2013 nearly <a href=\"https://tufts.app.box.com/v/democracy-counts-2020\">two-thirds of whom voted in 2020</a>. As part of the push, Harris and Walz <a href=\"https://www.essence.com/news/harris-walz-campaign-hbcu-homecoming-tour/\">launched</a> a homecoming tour of historically Black colleges and universities, aiming to reach young Black students across the battleground states.</p> \n<p>Democratic organizers say Harris has made concerted policy appeals to young people, particularly on housing and abortion, which she highlighted in a recent appearance on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/07/kamala-harris-call-her-daddy-podcast-comments\">Call Her Daddy</a> podcast that is popular with gen Z women.Harris has also staked out support for <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/09/24/harris-filibuster-abortion-trump-2024\">eliminating the filibuster </a>to codify abortion rightsas well as <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/4907402-harris-says-she-backs-legalizing-marijuana-going-further-than-biden/\">legalizing recreational marijuana</a>.</p> \n<p>Still, her pivot to the ideological center since becoming the Democratic nominee has left some young progressives <a href=\"https://www.sunrisemovement.org/movement-updates/sunrise-has-contacted-344437-young-voters-heres-what-were-hearing/\">disappointed</a>. On the campaign trail, Harris frequently promotes her <a href=\"https://x.com/sunrisemvmt/status/1833719577433268254\">support for fracking</a> \u2013 a reversal from her 2019 presidential run when she embraced a ban. She has also adopted an increasingly <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y8GSbgtbCneEhbbxV1J55tkCUKSOO2TN/view\">hardline approach to illegal immigration</a> and resisted calls to endorse an arms embargo on Israel, whose devastating campaign in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians.</p> \n<p>\u201cYoung people right now, our generation in general, are very, very clear-eyed on the fact that Donald Trump cannot return to the White House in November,\u201d said Mejia, the progressive activist with Pop. \u201cThe question presented to the Democratic party is: how much does it want to invite young people into its coalition in order to defeat Donald Trump?\u201d</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<h2>\u2018Something our generation hasn\u2019t seen yet\u2019</h2> \n<p>In the weeks since Harris entered the presidential race, she has steadily recaptured lost ground, multiplying Biden\u2019s lead among young voters.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://iop.harvard.edu/youth-poll/48th-edition-fall-2024\">Harvard Youth Poll</a> showed Harris with a commanding 32-point lead over Trump among likely voters aged 18 to 29. Young Democrats expressed a heightened commitment to voting this November, with significantly more \u201cdefinitely\u201d planning to cast a ballot compared with their Republican counterparts. Yet the overall share of young Americans who said they definitely planned to cast a ballot this year was 56%, down slightly from 63% <a href=\"https://iop.harvard.edu/news/harvard-youth-poll-election-2020\">at this point in 2020</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cYoung people are right to be cynical and I don\u2019t expect one candidate to change that,\u201d said Cristina Tzintz\u00fan Ramirez, <a href=\"https://nextgenamerica.org/\">the president of NextGen America</a>, one of the largest youth-voting groups in the country. \u201cThat happens over time by government responding.\u201d</p> \n<p>But the first step is electing leaders who listen to young people, Tzintz\u00fan Ramirez said, arguing that Harris was the only presidential candidate offering solutions to their concerns on the <a href=\"https://nextgenamerica.org/youthvotepoll072024/\">economy and abortion rights</a>. There are signs young people increasingly agree. A recent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/08/us/elections/times-siena-poll-likely-electorate-crosstabs.html\">New York Times and Siena College</a> poll found that voters under age 30 were significantly more likely than older voters to believe that Harris \u201ccares about people like you\u201d and to see her as a representative of \u201cchange\u201d. They were also more inclined to view Harris as a \u201cstrong leader\u201d and to describe her as \u201cfun\u201d.</p> \n<p>Though the glow of \u201cbrat summer\u201d has faded with the season, organizers say they have been able to convert that energy into lasting on-the-ground efforts to help turn out the vote. Over the next few weeks, youth voter engagement groups will be out in force, knocking on doors, registering students, and making pledges \u2013 and <a href=\"https://nextgenamerica.org/vote/\">plans</a> \u2013 to vote. In true gen Z fashion, youth organizers are also using memes and <a href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/identity/gen-z-2024-election-voting-events-49398412\">friendship bracelets</a> to drive young people to the polls.</p> \n<p>In the days ahead, Pecora of Voters of Tomorrow will cast her first vote for president, a mail-in ballot for Harris. It will be counted in California, hardly a presidential battleground but, poignantly, the vice-president\u2019s home state.</p> \n<p>Pecora was just 13 in 2016, when Hillary Clinton conceded the election to Trump. She was in high school, taking classes by Zoom, during the depths of the coronavirus pandemic when Biden won four years later. Then came the nightmarish Capitol riot on January 6, when Trump\u2019s supporters tried to stop the peaceful transfer of power. \u201cThere has yet to be a presidential cycle in my lifetime when democracy wasn\u2019t on the line,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Yet the 20-year-old is allowing herself to be hopeful, even as her team pours over numbers that tell the same story \u2013 that the race will be nail-bitingly close. Voters of Tomorrow says its on track to reach its <a href=\"https://x.com/jackplobel/status/1844369059942658277\">ambitious goal</a> of 15 million direct contacts in hopes, Pecora said, of electing a leader who recognizes the \u201cpower and agency\u201d of young people.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe see an option that tells us that politics can be something different,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can be more hopeful, more productive, more caring and empathetic and loving. And that\u2019s something that our generation hasn\u2019t really seen yet.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was the height of \u201cbrat summer\u201d. Kamala Harris was a \u201cfemininomenon\u201d, electrifying a high-stakes presidential race that many of the country\u2019s youngest voters had been dreading: a rematch between the two oldest candidates in American history. Chartreuse-blocked memes and coconut emojis filled social media feeds. The tidal wave of young \u201cKamalove\u201d sparked a rush of small-dollar donations and volunteer sign-ups for her days-old campaign. For an extremely online generation of young Democrats, the vibes were so good. On the ground in St Louis, a cadre of young progressives were gathering for an entirely different election \u2013 one with virtually no bearing on the balance of power in Washington, but one they believed mattered deeply. There in Missouri\u2019s first congressional district, representative Cori Bush was fighting for her political survival. Many of the twentysomethings had traveled from out of state, sacrificing summer jobs and sleeping on yoga mats to campaign for Bush in the sticky August heat. \u201cWe just stopped our lives and went to St Louis,\u201d said John Paul Mejia, a 22-year-old student and climate activist. Mejia was there as part of Protect Our Power (Pop), a youth coalition that came together earlier this year for what he described as a \u201cDavid-and-Goliath\u201d mission to defend leftwing members of Congress against a well-funded effort to unseat them. To them, Bush, the nurse turned racial justice activist, was one of the few elected leaders who shared their sense of urgency about everything from the country\u2019s affordability crisis to safeguarding abortion access. As a newly elected member of Congress, Bush had slept on the steps of the US Capitol to protest against the expiration of a federal eviction moratorium. The action paid off: the Biden administration extended the pause. In warning about the threat to reproductive rights, Bush testified before a House panel that she had had an abortion at 18 after becoming pregnant by rape. In 2023, she emerged as one of the strongest critics of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, a stance that reflected a groundswell of youth dissent but ultimately imperiled her congressional career. \u201cThere\u2019s pretty much nobody else, even members of Congress who are closer to our age, in some instances, who actually represent what our generation cares about,\u201d Vincent Vertuccio, a 21-year-old college student and an activist with Pop, said of the progressive Squad members. \u201cIf we lose these people, even one or two, it\u2019s a direct diminishment of our power.\u201d On the morning of the election, as the group made a final push to get out the vote, news broke that Harris, to their delight, had chosen the progressive midwestern governor Tim Walz as her running mate. From the trenches of a hard-fought campaign, they spared a moment to celebrate what felt like a win. That night, Bush lost her re-election bid in a primary contest decided by fewer than 7,000 votes. The defeat stung. Pop had run a scrappy campaign: its volunteers collectively placed 120,000 phone calls and knocked on more than 20,000 doors. But they were up against a torrent of outside spending, primarily by pro-Israel groups, that transformed the race into one of the most expensive House primaries in US history. \u201cPeople are feeling the issues really hard, but I don\u2019t think that they\u2019re feeling people fighting for them equally as hard,\u201d Mejia reflected afterward. \u201cThat worries me, especially at a time when we\u2019re also facing a crisis of democracy.\u201d *** Gen Z poised to play decisive role? In interviews with dozens of activists, organizers and candidates working to build youth political power on the left, a portrait emerged of a generation fed up with the status quo in Washington but eager to flex its electoral might this cycle. Many are genuinely enthusiastic about the prospect of a Harris presidency. Others hope she will be a bulwark against Republican extremism, if not the transformational figure they crave. With the presidential candidates offering sharply contrasting visions for the economy, abortion, climate change, foreign policy and democracy itself, there is an understanding among young liberals that the outcome could have profound, generational implications for the country \u2013 and the planet. \u201cWe are going to be the margin of victory,\u201d said Marianna Pecora, the 20-year-old communications director of Voters of Tomorrow, a gen Z-led group working to mobilize first-time voters and students. As the race moves into its final stretch, her closing pitch is direct: \u201cDon\u2019t let this election happen to you.\u201d Approximately 41 million members of gen Z will be eligible to vote in November, including millions who were too young to vote in the 2020 election. Their participation could be decisive: the presidential contest is deadlocked, probably hinging on tens of thousands of votes in a handful of swing states, and the battle for control of Congress is as close as ever. Yet no generation is a political monolith, and gen Z \u2013 the left-leaning, racially diverse cohort born between the late 1990s and early 2010s \u2013 is no exception. Millions of young adults identify as conservative, and a widening youth gender gap has emerged as a central political fault line. Still, experts say this generation face an unprecedented set of challenges \u2013 from the economic to the existential \u2013 that have eroded their faith in American institutions and fueled a deepening sense of \u201cfatalism\u201d about their own futures and the fate of the country. \u201cWe weren\u2019t part of the structures and the systems that created this massive situation but now it\u2019s really on us to fix it,\u201d said Vertuccio, who has a tattoo that reads, \u201corganizing works\u201d. Gen Z has lived through tumultuous times, from the worst recession since the Great Depression, which saw millions of American families lose their homes, jobs and savings with almost no consequence for those who caused it, to a pandemic that closed their schools and their polarized communities. They\u2019ve experienced political whiplash when the country that twice elected Barack Obama chose Trump as his successor. In 2020, they turned out in force to defeat Donald Trump, only to witness the 45th president refuse to concede and his far-right allies attempt to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s victory by force. A growing body of research suggests that rising economic inequality, climate change and technological advancements are taking a toll on young people\u2019s mental health, leading to high levels of anxiety and loneliness. A recent NBC News poll of gen Z adults found that nearly half expect life for their generation to be \u201cworse than previous generations\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling of vulnerability and isolation \u2013 that there\u2019s no one really representing their interests, particularly politically,\u201d said Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI). \u201cWhere you have a lot of young women becoming more active in politics because of that, particularly progressive women, a lot of men are just withdrawing completely, whether it\u2019s dating, politics or work.\u201d Surveys indicate that both young men and young women favor Harris over Trump. But the youth gender gap is striking. In a youth poll released by Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Institute of Politics, Harris led Trump by 47 percentage points among young women, compared with 17 percentage points among young men. The gulf-wide \u2013 and growing \u2013 divide reflects a dynamic that is shaping the 2024 election and could have lasting implications for both political parties: young women have become more liberal, as young men drift away from the Democratic party. There is virtually no doubt that Harris will win more young voters than Trump in November, but the margin will matter greatly. For decades, Democrats have dominated the youth vote, with voters aged 18 to 29 favoring Biden by 24 percentage points in 2020, according to Tufts University\u2019s Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (Circle). While young people have historically voted at lower rates than older adults, that trend may be starting to change. Youth voter turnout rose to 50% in 2020, probably a modern record and a remarkable 11-point increase from the 2016 presidential election, according to a Circle analysis. Young voters of color, it found, played a particularly \u201cinstrumental\u201d role in Biden\u2019s victories in closely contested battlegrounds such as Georgia, Pennsylvania and Arizona. Two years later, young people again voted at high levels during the congressional midterms. Their fury over the supreme court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v Wade was credited with helping Democrats defy historical expectations. Young voters are once again poised to play a potentially decisive role this election, said Melissa Deckman, CEO of Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) and author of the forthcoming book The Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape Our Democracy. \u201cWhen there\u2019s an issue that gen Z is passionate about,\u201d she said, \u201cthey\u2019re willing to engage, despite \u2013 or maybe because of \u2013 the fact that institutions aren\u2019t necessarily addressing their concerns.\u201d *** From youth activism to youth votes For a segment of gen Z, youth activism has practically become a rite of passage. Rather than despair, many young people mobilized in response to the election of Trump, to school shootings that killed classmates, to the climate crisis, which they believe too many of their leaders still ignore, episodes of police brutality captured on video, the rising tide of post-pandemic book bans and anti-LGBTQ+ laws, a bloody Middle East war playing out in real time on their phones, and the loss of federal abortion protections that has left young women with fewer rights than their grandmothers. \u201cPerhaps the most important, consistent finding over 25 years of analyzing young voters \u2013 the most significant predictor of youth participation \u2013 is that young people participate when they can see a tangible difference in the process,\u201d said John Della Volpe, director of polling at Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics and the author of Fight: How Gen Z Is Channeling Their Fear and Passion to Save America. This generation of activists, the first born after the release of the smartphone, blends traditional methods of activism \u2013 like old-school marches and campus protests \u2013 with modern digital strategies such as TikTok trolls and internet memes. But even more, what makes their activism unique, researchers say, is the way they have translated youth protest into youth voter participation. \u201cWhen the oldest members of gen Z turned voting age, they carried those values forward and voted at rates that previous generations have not even touched,\u201d Della Volpe said. Despite their low confidence in American institutions, Della Volpe said gen Z, including young men, tend to be pro-government. As a cohort, they are more likely than older Americans to say that the federal government should \u2013 and must \u2013 do more to address the country\u2019s problems. Some young people, like Ben Braver, a 22-year-old public school teacher near Tampa, Florida, aren\u2019t waiting for their elected elders to act. Braver, who shares earnest explainer videos on TikTok making the case for progressive policies, is running for a seat in the Florida state senate. He decided to challenge his Republican opponent, the incumbent state senator, after he voted for Florida\u2019s six-week abortion ban that took effect earlier this year. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to wait until 2040, when we\u2019re already the majority. We have to start now,\u201d Braver said. \u201cWe need people writing policy that they\u2019ll have to live under.\u201d *** Building power in a right-leaning structure Santiago Mayer emigrated from Mexico to the US as a teenager in 2017, arriving in the heady months after Trump took office. At his new high school in southern California, he was shocked to learn that many of his classmates were mostly tuned out. Trump, who ran for president on a fiercely anti-immigrant platform, had just implemented a travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim countries and was pushing Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIf young people had voted in 2016, we might have been able to avoid the Trump administration,\u201d Mayer, now 22, observed. At the time, the teen turned to \u201cpre-Elon\u201d Twitter. His unfiltered anti-Trump musings gathered a following and in 2019, his handle, Voters of Tomorrow, graduated from a Twitter account to an official political engagement organization \u201cfor gen Z, by gen Z\u201d \u2013 just in time to help drive Trump from office. \u201cThey pissed off the wrong generation,\u201d emerged as a rallying cry. Mayer\u2019s team became enthusiastic boosters of the Biden administration. They worked to translate the president\u2019s sprawling, sometimes wonky, achievements on climate, gun control and student loan debt for a generation increasingly turns to social media for its news. But over the course of Biden\u2019s term, many young people grew disenchanted with the 81-year-old president, harboring reservations about his foreign policy and age. \u201cYoung people want to vote for someone who\u2019s going to shake the system,\u201d Link Lauren, a young, right-leaning TikTok influencer who worked on Robert F Kennedy\u2019s independent presidential campaign, said in an interview this summer. \u201cThey want disruption.\u201d Early polls showed Trump performing far better with this voting bloc than he had in 2020 and, in some cases, drawing even with \u2013 or doing better than \u2013 Biden. The numbers sent shockwaves through the Democratic party. Was gen Z turning Maga? Analysts and organizers, Mayer included, were skeptical. Gen Z, after all, was more socially liberal, less religious, more educated and more likely to identify as LGBTQ+ than previous generations. Rather, they saw the numbers as a pulse check: young people were frustrated by the state of the post-pandemic economy, by the slow pace of change in Washington and, yes, by the prospect of a contest between the same (very) old candidates who had dominated much of gen Z\u2019s political memory. Mayer identified a deeper tension: a left-leaning generation was trying to build power within a political system that seemed to structurally bend rightward. With Biden as president, there had been an expectation that he would guard against Republican threats to the environment, abortion access, voting rights and gun control. But then the most conservative supreme court in history stepped in and eroded those protections while raising the possibility that other rights could be next. Gerrymandering has made the US House less competitive, harder to govern and more polarized while an arcane Senate rule known as the filibuster stands in the way of most major legislation. Beyond Washington, the country is increasingly cracked into red states and blue states with dramatically different laws governing abortion access, LGBTQ+ protections and union membership. \u201cWhen you see kids gunned down in schools, then the supreme court says domestic abusers can have guns and your abortion rights are gone, it creates a sense of hopelessness,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cIt feels like the government is working against you.\u201d *** The coconut army The mood among young Democrats changed entirely on 21 July, when the octogenarian president exited the race and threw his support behind Harris, who, at 59, seemed positively youthful by comparison. Marion Smart, a 21-year-old student organizer with Voters of Tomorrow\u2019s Georgia chapter, was preparing to welcome hundreds of liberal students and activists to the group\u2019s Year of Youth summit in Atlanta when it happened. Summit-goers descended on Atlanta\u2019s Loudermilk center days later, chugging boxes of coconut water as they dashed between a panel on running for office as a member of gen Z and a training led by a panda head-wearing digital organizer. Harris\u2019s nascent campaign sent an envoy, Eve Levenson, the national youth engagement director, and the vice-president herself took time in the whirlwind of her elevation to record a pre-taped message, in which she vowed to work for their vote. In response, they pledged to turn out the youth vote. \u201cWe\u2019re all part of the coconut army and we\u2019re gonna take this election by storm,\u201d Smart said. Ashleigh Ewald, the group\u2019s Georgia state director, felt the political ground shift immediately. She had toiled for months on college campuses around the state, trying to convince her discontented peers to get involved in the November election. Now they were seeking her out, asking how they could help. \u201cBecause of Kamala Harris, that pessimism turned into enthusiasm,\u201d the 22-year-old said. Gen z voters have flocked to the vice-president, helping to drive up her popularity.But Harris\u2019s ground-breaking candidacy \u2013 she would be the first woman to serve as president of the United States \u2013 has particularly energized young women. After she entered the race, youth voter registration among young women rose sharply \u2013 a trend one Democratic data analyst dubbed the \u201cHarris effect.\u201d Nearly six in 10 women under age 30 view her potential presidency as a \u201cvery important\u201d milestone in American political history, according to a national survey by AEI\u2019s Survey Center on American Life. The sentiment is notably more pronounced for younger women than it is for older women and significantly more than for younger men. Leaving a \u201ccontingency planning\u201d workshop for a potential Trump victory, Amini Bonane said the session had been a sobering reminder of the stakes this election. It was part of the reason Bonane, a 29-year-old community organizer who came to the US as a refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo, decided to run for a seat on the city council in her home town of Fairfax, Virginia. With Harris as the nominee, she has felt a surge of energy in her own race. \u201cI\u2019m just so excited and \u2013 hello! \u2013 I\u2019ll be on the same ballot as,\u201d she paused, shaking her hands in excitement, \u201cpossibly the first Black woman Potus. That is just so motivating for me.\u201d *** Courting gen Z The online hype that followed Harris\u2019s sudden emergence was not only good for the vibes. It helped reset the entire political narrative around her, propelling the once-unpopular vice president into what her campaign playfully coined its \u201cKamala era\u201d. Conservative media outlets had long amplified Harris\u2019s quirky turns of phrase \u2013derided as \u201cword salads\u201d \u2013 and her laugh to portray her as unserious. Young supporters reinterpreted those same clips as charming and authentic \u2013 a powerful currency in contemporary politics. Harris\u2019s campaign has nodded back, embracing the viral trends on her gen Z-run TikTok, @kamalahq. It eclipses Trump\u2019s personal account, @realdonaldtrump, in engagement, though he has substantially more followers. During a youth voter drive last month, Harris said young voters were part of the reason she was so optimistic about the future. \u201cYour generation is killing it,\u201d she said on a call with gen Z organizers. \u201cYou\u2019re brilliant. You care. You\u2019re impatient in every incredible, good way.\u201d To offset Harris\u2019s steep advantage with young women, Trump has been heavily courting gen Z\u2019s \u201cbro\u201d vote with amped up displays of masculinity. He has turned up at Ultimate Fighting Championship bouts and a college fraternity house. Wrestler Hulk Hogan tore off his shirt during a speech at the Republican convention in which he praised Trump as a \u201cgladiator\u201d. The former president has appeared on shows with the controversial YouTuber Logan Paul and video game streamer Adin Ross, both of whom attract sizable followings of gen Z men. The Nelk Boys, a group of online content creators and pranksters, are helping too, by spearheading a voter registration initiative on Trump\u2019s behalf. His team is also relying on Turning Point Action, the political advocacy wing of the far-right youth organization Turning Point USA, to drive out young conservatives. The Harris campaign and allied youth groups, meanwhile, are aggressively targeting college students \u2013 nearly two-thirds of whom voted in 2020. As part of the push, Harris and Walz launched a homecoming tour of historically Black colleges and universities, aiming to reach young Black students across the battleground states. Democratic organizers say Harris has made concerted policy appeals to young people, particularly on housing and abortion, which she highlighted in a recent appearance on the Call Her Daddy podcast that is popular with gen Z women.Harris has also staked out support for eliminating the filibuster to codify abortion rightsas well as legalizing recreational marijuana. Still, her pivot to the ideological center since becoming the Democratic nominee has left some young progressives disappointed. On the campaign trail, Harris frequently promotes her support for fracking \u2013 a reversal from her 2019 presidential run when she embraced a ban. She has also adopted an increasingly hardline approach to illegal immigration and resisted calls to endorse an arms embargo on Israel, whose devastating campaign in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians. \u201cYoung people right now, our generation in general, are very, very clear-eyed on the fact that Donald Trump cannot return to the White House in November,\u201d said Mejia, the progressive activist with Pop. \u201cThe question presented to the Democratic party is: how much does it want to invite young people into its coalition in order to defeat Donald Trump?\u201d *** \u2018Something our generation hasn\u2019t seen yet\u2019 In the weeks since Harris entered the presidential race, she has steadily recaptured lost ground, multiplying Biden\u2019s lead among young voters. The Harvard Youth Poll showed Harris with a commanding 32-point lead over Trump among likely voters aged 18 to 29. Young Democrats expressed a heightened commitment to voting this November, with significantly more \u201cdefinitely\u201d planning to cast a ballot compared with their Republican counterparts. Yet the overall share of young Americans who said they definitely planned to cast a ballot this year was 56%, down slightly from 63% at this point in 2020. \u201cYoung people are right to be cynical and I don\u2019t expect one candidate to change that,\u201d said Cristina Tzintz\u00fan Ramirez, the president of NextGen America, one of the largest youth-voting groups in the country. \u201cThat happens over time by government responding.\u201d But the first step is electing leaders who listen to young people, Tzintz\u00fan Ramirez said, arguing that Harris was the only presidential candidate offering solutions to their concerns on the economy and abortion rights. There are signs young people increasingly agree. A recent New York Times and Siena College poll found that voters under age 30 were significantly more likely than older voters to believe that Harris \u201ccares about people like you\u201d and to see her as a representative of \u201cchange\u201d. They were also more inclined to view Harris as a \u201cstrong leader\u201d and to describe her as \u201cfun\u201d. Though the glow of \u201cbrat summer\u201d has faded with the season, organizers say they have been able to convert that energy into lasting on-the-ground efforts to help turn out the vote. Over the next few weeks, youth voter engagement groups will be out in force, knocking on doors, registering students, and making pledges \u2013 and plans \u2013 to vote. In true gen Z fashion, youth organizers are also using memes and friendship bracelets to drive young people to the polls. In the days ahead, Pecora of Voters of Tomorrow will cast her first vote for president, a mail-in ballot for Harris. It will be counted in California, hardly a presidential battleground but, poignantly, the vice-president\u2019s home state. Pecora was just 13 in 2016, when Hillary Clinton conceded the election to Trump. She was in high school, taking classes by Zoom, during the depths of the coronavirus pandemic when Biden won four years later. Then came the nightmarish Capitol riot on January 6, when Trump\u2019s supporters tried to stop the peaceful transfer of power. \u201cThere has yet to be a presidential cycle in my lifetime when democracy wasn\u2019t on the line,\u201d she said. Yet the 20-year-old is allowing herself to be hopeful, even as her team pours over numbers that tell the same story \u2013 that the race will be nail-bitingly close. Voters of Tomorrow says its on track to reach its ambitious goal of 15 million direct contacts in hopes, Pecora said, of electing a leader who recognizes the \u201cpower and agency\u201d of young people. \u201cWe see an option that tells us that politics can be something different,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can be more hopeful, more productive, more caring and empathetic and loving. And that\u2019s something that our generation hasn\u2019t really seen yet.\u201d",

The Observer reported in August that about 30 mainly Brazilian delivery riders working for large companies such as Deliveroo and Uber Eats were living in dilapidated caravans in the centre of Bristol. Many claimed they were, in effect, earning below the minimum wage and could not afford to rent in the city. Last week, it emerged their roadside encampment was raided by immigration enforcement officers on 3 October, with 17 people arrested and 13 people taken to detention centres in London. They now face potential removal from the UK even though some of them have lived in the country for years.

      "body": "<p>According to Spotify, Alex Cooper\u2019s podcast Call Her Daddy is the second-most-listened-to podcast <a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-11-29/top-songs-artists-podcasts-albums-trends-2023/\">in the world</a>, behind only The Joe Rogan Experience and with a <em>very </em>different audience. While the audience for Rogan\u2019s health advice and anti-woke politics skews heavily male, Cooper\u2019s podcast of girls\u2019 room secrets, dating stories and therapy-like disclosures is listened to by young, sex-positive women. Cooper, who turned 30 this year,<strong> </strong>invites guests such as Katy Perry, Heidi Klum and Miley Cyrus to dress down (most appear on the podcast clad in sweatsuits and baseball caps) and share intimate details of their sexual and psychological lives<strong>.</strong></p> <p>Cooper\u2019s honesty is wildly popular and profitable; in 2021, she inked a $60m deal with Spotify, one of the biggest ever for a podcast at the time. In August, she signed a new deal <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/20/business/alex-cooper-call-her-daddy-spotify-podcast/index.html\">worth more than double</a> that, leaving Spotify for a $125m three-year offer from the US radio company SiriusXM.</p> <p>The big money hasn\u2019t dulled the sexual content. A recent sampling of episode titles reads like 1970s Cosmopolitan cover lines: Narcissists, Blow Jobs, and Red Flags; Getting Older, Hotter, and Wiser; and I Made Out with My Boyfriend\u2019s Mistress.</p> <p>So regular listeners may have been to surprised to hear Kamala Harris sit down opposite Cooper on the podcast this week, not least because Cooper herself had promised not to sully her sex-positive show with staged political appearances.</p> <p>In February, she told the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/18/style/alex-cooper-call-her-daddy-podcast.html\">New York Times</a> she had shut down conversations with the White House. \u201cGo on CNN, go on Fox,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cYou want to talk about your sex life, Joe [Biden]?\u201d</p> <p>Weeks before the election, Cooper has had a change of heart. \u201cAt the end of the day, I couldn\u2019t see a world in which one of the main conversations in this election is women, and I\u2019m not a part of it,\u201d she explained on air, reflecting how central she sees herself to female pop culture in the US.</p> <p>For Harris, the decision to go on such an explicit podcast might seem risque, but politically it makes perfect sense. Not only does Call Her Daddy have huge reach among young women, but because Cooper has kept politics away from her public image, experts suspect that her audience might be a well of untapped, undecided voters, too.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone I know has at least tuned into a Call Her Daddy episode,\u201d said Jessica Siles, the deputy press secretary of the gen Z-led non-profit Voters of Tomorrow. \u201cIt\u2019s not a news show; it\u2019s a lifestyle podcast, and those are the exact sort of people who need Harris\u2019s message more than others. She\u2019s reaching an audience that she hasn\u2019t met before, who might align with her on some of the issues, but need a little bit of a push to turn out.\u201d</p>    <p>The show had a different tone from previous episodes. Harris didn\u2019t get any questions about sex positions or bachelorette parties. Instead the conversation mainly focused on reproductive health, women\u2019s rights and the vice-president\u2019s family life.</p> <p>Though Cooper switched out her trademark sweatpants for what can best be described as gen Z business casual (black stiletto boots, black wide leg jeans, and a hooded sweatshirt branded with \u201cUnwell\u201d, the name of her media company), the interview still read as comfy, with Harris fielding mostly safe questions.</p> <p>The standout moment came when Harris shot back at Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u2019 recent comments about Harris\u2019s lack of biological children. (The Arkansas governor said: \u201cMy kids keep me humble. Unfortunately, Kamala Harris doesn\u2019t have anything keeping her humble.\u201d) \u201cI don\u2019t think she understands that there are a whole lot of women out here who, one, are not aspiring to be humble. Two, a whole lot of women out here who have a lot of love in their life, family in their life, and children in their life.\u201d</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t all stump speech. Harris chatted about being friends with Kerstin Emhoff, her husband Doug\u2019s ex-wife and mother to Harris\u2019s stepchildren, Ella and Cole: \u201cFamily comes in many forms \u2026 This is not the 1950s any more.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/08/kamala-harris-beer-stephen-colbert-interview\">The high life: Kamala Harris cracks open a beer with Stephen Colbert</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cooper opened the episode with a disclaimer, suggesting her interview was not necessarily an endorsement of Harris: \u201cI am so aware I have a very mixed audience when it comes to politics,\u201d she said. \u201cSo please hear me when I say my goal today is not to change your political affiliation.\u201d</p> <p>But Cooper does come with political baggage. A former ad sales representative, she started Call Her Daddy with her roommate, Sofia Franklyn, in 2018, as a forum for what they <a href=\"https://people.com/human-interest/all-about-alex-cooper/\">dubbed</a> \u201cfemale locker room talk\u201d. The podcast was quickly picked up by Barstool Sports, a media company known for its blog covering sports, pop culture and viral moments. Barstool\u2019s owner, Dave Portnoy, is an archetypical frat boy with a history of making misogynistic and racist remarks. The journalist Matthew Walther coined the term \u201cBarstool conservatism\u201d to describe the political leanings of the young men who read Barstool and hold libertarian, but socially conservative, views.</p> <p>When faced with accusations of misogyny and toxic workplace practices, Portnoy held up Call Her Daddy as a marquee name and proof the company wasn\u2019t only appealing to young misogynist men. \u201cI gave two girls their own radio show. We have hired girl after girl \u2013 they say it\u2019s a great place to work,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/barstool-sports-dave-portnoy-responds-to-accusations-of-toxicity-and-misogyny-2018-12\">he said</a> at the time.</p> <p>But that love didn\u2019t last: in the summer of 2020, Call Her Daddy went dark. After weeks of silence, Portnoy said the hosts and Barstool were involved in a contract dispute, with Cooper agreeing to go on with Barstool but Franklyn unwilling to agree to the terms. He <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/19/style/call-her-daddy-podcast.html\">called</a> the hosts \u201cunprofessional, disloyal, and greedy\u201d and said Barstool lost $100,000 with every missed episode.</p> <p>This fracture ultimately caused a split between the hosts, and Cooper continued without Franklyn. Cooper <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/20/business/alex-cooper-call-her-daddy-spotify-podcast/index.html#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20Cooper%20left%20Barstool,Cooper%20said%20in%20a%20statement.\">parted with Barstool</a> a year later, when the Spotify deal came through.</p> <p>Messiness aside, Cooper\u2019s initial association with Portnoy might explain why, even if she has socially liberal values, she remains associated with a type of fratty, more conservative listener \u2013&nbsp;the kinds of girls who might date guys who read Barstool and maybe even vote for Donald Trump.</p> <p>Jeri Steinmetz and Ciara Parsons are cousins who host a rival comedic conversation podcast, Ladies &amp; Tangents. (Tagline: \u201cThink sleepover but we all have mental health disorders.\u201d) The pair say many lifestyle podcasters start out non-partisan to avoid controversy, but it\u2019s tough to stay that way in a hyper-political world.</p>    <p>\u201cWe\u2019re women, mothers, and these issues directly affect us and our fans. So we did start speaking out, and I think that\u2019s what happened here with Call Her Daddy,\u201d Steinmetz said.</p> <p>Cooper, who declined a request for comment, seemed to expect backlash to the episode, and got it from all sides. Some listeners wished she would stay out of politics. Others wanted her to be tougher on Harris. Some questioned the optics of Harris doing the interview so soon after the devastation of Hurricane Helene.</p> <p>\u201cSo cool! Kamala sits down for a podcast as a fourth of the country is underwater,\u201d one Instagram user wrote in a comment on the podcast\u2019s page. \u201cShe can\u2019t hold a press conference but can go on podcasts lol,\u201d said another.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/alex-cooper-followers-after-harris-interview-1965739\">Newsweek</a> reported that the show and Cooper herself lost \u201cthousands\u201d of Instagram followers after the episode dropped.</p> <p>But<strong> </strong>Cooper\u2019s reach remains phenomenal as traditional news outlets hemorrhage audiences, and she\u2019s become an avatar for a generation that\u2019s more likely to learn about headlines through a TikTok or Instagram reel. Variety <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/music/news/alex-cooper-call-her-daddy-podcast-bump-streams-anitta-1235662214/\">reported</a> that musicians who appear on her show see a boost on music streaming apps \u2013&nbsp;even ones who are celebrities on their own, such as John Mayer (who saw streams jump by 350%) and John Legend (200%). <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/alex-cooper-and-matthew-kaplan-wedding\">Vogue</a> gave lavish coverage to Cooper\u2019s \u201cintimate beachside wedding\u201d to the producer Matt Kaplan, which took place on Mexico\u2019s Yucat\u00e1n peninsula.</p> <p>Though Call Her Daddy has matured in recent years, becoming as much about mental health as it is about masturbation, it\u2019s been tough for Cooper to shake her reputation of, as the New York Times put it, \u201can evangelist of feminine raunch\u201d. She\u2019s become so synonymous with the world of women\u2019s media that Netflix\u2019s new romantic comedy series Nobody Wants This name-drops her as a rival to its main character, a blonde sex-podcast host played by Kristen Bell.</p> <p>Harris is not the first candidate to use a buzzy entertainment show to try to reach younger voters. Barack Obama wooed millennials by appearing on Zach Galifianakis\u2019s YouTube show and Bill Clinton played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show.</p> <p>But Rebeca Damico, a 21-year-old public relations specialist and avid Call Her Daddy Fan from Salt Lake City, says this was a more revealing encounter. She felt she learned more about Harris through this interview than in last month\u2019s presidential debate.</p> <p>\u201cI watched the debate, and it was way more comical than informational,\u201d she said. \u201cCall Her Daddy did a good job at humanizing Harris, and it was cool to see her not even as a politician, but as a woman.\u201d</p> <p>In the spirit of fairness, Cooper said she had invited Trump on the show to counter Harris\u2019s points. He has yet to respond. \u201cThat would be such a fascinating episode,\u201d said Siles, the Voters of Tomorrow press secretary. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m not sure I believe Donald Trump knows what a pap smear is. So to go on a show about women\u2019s issues would be entertaining, at least.\u201d</p>",

In February, she told the New York Times she had shut down conversations with the White House. \u201cGo on CNN, go on Fox,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cYou want to talk about your sex life, Joe [Biden]?\u201d Weeks before the election, Cooper has had a change of heart. \u201cAt the end of the day, I couldn\u2019t see a world in which one of the main conversations in this election is women, and I\u2019m not a part of it,\u201d she explained on air, reflecting how central she sees herself to female pop culture in the US. For Harris, the decision to go on such an explicit podcast might seem risque, but politically it makes perfect sense. Not only does Call Her Daddy have huge reach among young women, but because Cooper has kept politics away from her public image, experts suspect that her audience might be a well of untapped, undecided voters, too. \u201cEveryone I know has at least tuned into a Call Her Daddy episode,\u201d said Jessica Siles, the deputy press secretary of the gen Z-led non-profit Voters of Tomorrow. \u201cIt\u2019s not a news show; it\u2019s a lifestyle podcast, and those are the exact sort of people who need Harris\u2019s message more than others. She\u2019s reaching an audience that she hasn\u2019t met before, who might align with her on some of the issues, but need a little bit of a push to turn out.\u201d The show had a different tone from previous episodes. Harris didn\u2019t get any questions about sex positions or bachelorette parties. Instead the conversation mainly focused on reproductive health, women\u2019s rights and the vice-president\u2019s family life. Though Cooper switched out her trademark sweatpants for what can best be described as gen Z business casual (black stiletto boots, black wide leg jeans, and a hooded sweatshirt branded with \u201cUnwell\u201d, the name of her media company), the interview still read as comfy, with Harris fielding mostly safe questions. The standout moment came when Harris shot back at Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u2019 recent comments about Harris\u2019s lack of biological children. (The Arkansas governor said: \u201cMy kids keep me humble. Unfortunately, Kamala Harris doesn\u2019t have anything keeping her humble.\u201d) \u201cI don\u2019t think she understands that there are a whole lot of women out here who, one, are not aspiring to be humble. Two, a whole lot of women out here who have a lot of love in their life, family in their life, and children in their life.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t all stump speech. Harris chatted about being friends with Kerstin Emhoff, her husband Doug\u2019s ex-wife and mother to Harris\u2019s stepchildren, Ella and Cole: \u201cFamily comes in many forms \u2026 This is not the 1950s any more.\u201d Cooper opened the episode with a disclaimer, suggesting her interview was not necessarily an endorsement of Harris: \u201cI am so aware I have a very mixed audience when it comes to politics,\u201d she said. \u201cSo please hear me when I say my goal today is not to change your political affiliation.\u201d But Cooper does come with political baggage. A former ad sales representative, she started Call Her Daddy with her roommate, Sofia Franklyn, in 2018, as a forum for what they dubbed \u201cfemale locker room talk\u201d. The podcast was quickly picked up by Barstool Sports, a media company known for its blog covering sports, pop culture and viral moments. Barstool\u2019s owner, Dave Portnoy, is an archetypical frat boy with a history of making misogynistic and racist remarks. The journalist Matthew Walther coined the term \u201cBarstool conservatism\u201d to describe the political leanings of the young men who read Barstool and hold libertarian, but socially conservative, views. When faced with accusations of misogyny and toxic workplace practices, Portnoy held up Call Her Daddy as a marquee name and proof the company wasn\u2019t only appealing to young misogynist men. \u201cI gave two girls their own radio show. We have hired girl after girl \u2013 they say it\u2019s a great place to work,\u201d he said at the time. But that love didn\u2019t last: in the summer of 2020, Call Her Daddy went dark. After weeks of silence, Portnoy said the hosts and Barstool were involved in a contract dispute, with Cooper agreeing to go on with Barstool but Franklyn unwilling to agree to the terms. He called the hosts \u201cunprofessional, disloyal, and greedy\u201d and said Barstool lost $100,000 with every missed episode. This fracture ultimately caused a split between the hosts, and Cooper continued without Franklyn. Cooper parted with Barstool a year later, when the Spotify deal came through. Messiness aside, Cooper\u2019s initial association with Portnoy might explain why, even if she has socially liberal values, she remains associated with a type of fratty, more conservative listener \u2013 the kinds of girls who might date guys who read Barstool and maybe even vote for Donald Trump. Jeri Steinmetz and Ciara Parsons are cousins who host a rival comedic conversation podcast, Ladies &amp; Tangents. (Tagline: \u201cThink sleepover but we all have mental health disorders.\u201d) The pair say many lifestyle podcasters start out non-partisan to avoid controversy, but it\u2019s tough to stay that way in a hyper-political world. \u201cWe\u2019re women, mothers, and these issues directly affect us and our fans. So we did start speaking out, and I think that\u2019s what happened here with Call Her Daddy,\u201d Steinmetz said. Cooper, who declined a request for comment, seemed to expect backlash to the episode, and got it from all sides. Some listeners wished she would stay out of politics. Others wanted her to be tougher on Harris. Some questioned the optics of Harris doing the interview so soon after the devastation of Hurricane Helene. \u201cSo cool! Kamala sits down for a podcast as a fourth of the country is underwater,\u201d one Instagram user wrote in a comment on the podcast\u2019s page. \u201cShe can\u2019t hold a press conference but can go on podcasts lol,\u201d said another. Newsweek reported that the show and Cooper herself lost \u201cthousands\u201d of Instagram followers after the episode dropped. But Cooper\u2019s reach remains phenomenal as traditional news outlets hemorrhage audiences, and she\u2019s become an avatar for a generation that\u2019s more likely to learn about headlines through a TikTok or Instagram reel. Variety reported that musicians who appear on her show see a boost on music streaming apps \u2013 even ones who are celebrities on their own, such as John Mayer (who saw streams jump by 350%) and John Legend (200%). Vogue gave lavish coverage to Cooper\u2019s \u201cintimate beachside wedding\u201d to the producer Matt Kaplan, which took place on Mexico\u2019s Yucat\u00e1n peninsula. Though Call Her Daddy has matured in recent years, becoming as much about mental health as it is about masturbation, it\u2019s been tough for Cooper to shake her reputation of, as the New York Times put it, \u201can evangelist of feminine raunch\u201d. She\u2019s become so synonymous with the world of women\u2019s media that Netflix\u2019s new romantic comedy series Nobody Wants This name-drops her as a rival to its main character, a blonde sex-podcast host played by Kristen Bell. Harris is not the first candidate to use a buzzy entertainment show to try to reach younger voters. Barack Obama wooed millennials by appearing on Zach Galifianakis\u2019s YouTube show and Bill Clinton played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show. But Rebeca Damico, a 21-year-old public relations specialist and avid Call Her Daddy Fan from Salt Lake City, says this was a more revealing encounter. She felt she learned more about Harris through this interview than in last month\u2019s presidential debate. \u201cI watched the debate, and it was way more comical than informational,\u201d she said. \u201cCall Her Daddy did a good job at humanizing Harris, and it was cool to see her not even as a politician, but as a woman.\u201d In the spirit of fairness, Cooper said she had invited Trump on the show to counter Harris\u2019s points. He has yet to respond. \u201cThat would be such a fascinating episode,\u201d said Siles, the Voters of Tomorrow press secretary. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m not sure I believe Donald Trump knows what a pap smear is. So to go on a show about women\u2019s issues would be entertaining, at least.\u201d",

Large, black and friskily beautiful \u2013 the ideal decoy, say, to a not quite convincingly sung aria \u2013 he was led off stage, mercifully, after a few expensive and nerve-racking minutes. Add in live videos, a rejigged version of the story, new dialogue and a visual leap from Revolutionary France, in Act 1, to the present day for Act 2, and you get it: Kratzer sees Beethoven\u2019s only opera as a mighty problem that needs solving. He hurls everything at it, turns up the houselights and incriminates each one of us in humanity\u2019s quest for libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9. Fair enough. Amid the squall of ideas or, were you feeling ungracious, \u201cideas\u201d, there are insights. New in 2020, designed by Rainer Sellmaier, lighting by Michael Bauer, the run was interrupted by the pandemic. The revival diector is Anja K\u00fchnhold.</p> <p>No one would pretend the work is without difficulties. For some, this parable of loyalty, bravery and the love of a faithful wife proves naive and cloying. Beethoven wrestled with its composition. That struggle, from darkness to light, harmonically and dramatically, is both its essence and its reward. If the cast was uneven, there were excellent performances where it mattered: specifically, <a href=\"https://jenniferdavis.co.uk/\">Jennifer Davis</a>, exemplary in the fiendishly taxing, high-lying title role of Fidelio/Leonore (referred to in the business, I\u2019m told, as a \u201clarynx-ripper\u201d), and Peter Rose a richly sympathetic Rocco. Eric Cutler was effective as a hairy, John the Baptist-style Florestan whose indignities included imprisonment on what appeared to be a desiccated dung heap. Christina Gansch (Marzelline) and Michael Gibson (Jacquino) were outstanding in their supporting roles, here somewhat fleshed out by Kratzer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The Royal Opera chorus\u2019s blazing finale, in which they step front of stage, singing full throttle, was as good as it gets</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Beethoven\u2019s score, restless in its constant shifts of style, key and mood, disregarding operatic convention at every turn, was conducted by <a href=\"https://www.alexandersoddy.com/\">Alexander Soddy</a>. Having built his career in Germany, the British conductor has worked exhaustively on <em>Fidelio</em> in Berlin and elsewhere. In his authority and clear understanding of the music, that familiarity paid off. The orchestra responded to his brisk tempi with fluency and expertise. High praise to horns and oboe. The chorus, too, negotiated their big moments with thrilling confidence, the blazing finale, in which they stepped front of stage, singing full throttle, as good as it gets. If you can override the lurching jumps and jolts of the production, go \u2013 for Beethoven.

This year\u2019s eclectic event encompassed Mozart concertos, Gabriel Faur\u00e9 a century after his death, jazz, new commissions, and a recital of music by women spanning 200 years (played by Susan Tomes, whose recent book <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/women-and-the-piano-9780300266573/\">Women and the Piano</a></em> explores the subject). In scale and repertoire, one programme was especially daring. On Sunday in Hall One, the Latvian <strong>Reinis Zari\u0146</strong><strong>\u0161</strong> made his festival debut with Messiaen\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.kingsplace.co.uk/whats-on/classical/messiaen-vingt-regards-sur-lenfant-jesus/\">Vingt Regards sur l\u2019Enfant J\u00e9sus</a></strong> (1945).</p> <p>The piano repertoire has many works that could be described, without hyperbole, as epic: no shortage by JS Bach (<em>Goldberg Variations</em>, <em>The Art of Fugue</em>), and if you Google names such as Satie, Sorabji and Rzewski you find pieces that last half a day or more. Messiaen\u2019s <em>Vingt Regards</em>, at a mere two and a quarter hours in Zari\u0146\u0161\u2019s performance, is compact in comparison. Its pianistic demands, as well as its spiritual design, could hardly be more ambitious. The 20 sections take us from the nativity of Jesus to the white-robed multitude of the resurrected, \u201call nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues\u201d as described in the biblical Book of Revelation. Messiaen was a devout Catholic, his faith inhabiting every note he wrote. References to angels, stars, rainbows, grace, suffering, radiance are scattered across the pages of his scores.</p>    <p>As pure music it has Messiaen\u2019s distinctive hallmarks: complex rhythms, inflections of Greek and Hindu traditions, ragas, gamelan, chant, modes and singular harmonic patterns. On his website, Zari\u0146\u0161 says he seeks, through music, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.reiniszarins.com/\">to </a><em><a href=\"https://www.reiniszarins.com/\">sound</a></em><a href=\"https://www.reiniszarins.com/\"> the mystery of life</a>\u201d, to look beyond. He brought this sense of the numinous to his visionary performance, while also maintaining precise control and mastery of every technical challenge presented.

I found them thoughtfully done and a useful reminder of Messiaen\u2019s intentions, no more awkward for a sceptic than anything else in the long tradition of religious music. From the vastness of part 6 \u2013 conjuring the creation of space, time, galaxies, photons, the lot \u2013 to the glassy, bopping chords of the contemplation of joy, to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwLTM_tkF6o\">Chopin-like intimacy of 15</a> (the kiss of the infant Jesus), Zari\u0146\u0161 gave a majestic, probing performance: a high point of the year.</p> <p>Messiaen needs no antidote, but the urgent, amplified pop rhythms and choral and choreographed abundance of <strong><a href=\"https://www.spinifexgum.com/home\">Spinifex Gum</a></strong> turned out to act as one. This choral song cycle created by Felix Riebl (of the Australian band the Cat Empire) was performed by <a href=\"https://gondwana.org.au/marliya/\">Marliya</a>, an all female ensemble of Indigenous Australian singers, with the children\u2019s voices of <a href=\"https://gondwana.org.au/\">Gondwana</a>, directed by Lyn Williams.

But these changes have not been thought through properly. They should be delayed \u2013 if not cancelled \u2013 until they are.\u201d</p>    <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/sep/06/work-capability-test-changes-could-cost-some-claimants-400-a-month\">changes to the WCA</a> were first announced by former Tory chancellor Jeremy Hunt last September. They are due to take effect from April 2025, with a final judgment on whether to proceed expected to be announced in Reeves\u2019s budget.</p> <p>Over the next six years, expenditure on both working-age incapacity and disability benefits is <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/under-strain/\">projected to increase</a> rapidly from \u00a343bn in 2022-23 to \u00a363bn in 2028-29, a real-terms increase of \u00a321bn (or 48%).</p> <p>As a result, Hunt announced changes to the current system with a new regime that was sold to the public as help for getting people into work, but which disabilities groups now say will simply make it harder for those most in need of state help to access the benefits they need.</p> <p>In particular, the Resolution Foundation is critical of plans to remove the \u201csubstantial risk\u201d descriptor (which enables people to receive benefits on the grounds of ill-health if not doing so is judged to pose a substantial risk to their physical and mental health), saying this has not been fully thought through.</p> <p>It says: \u201cThis change risks making the process too stringent, and risks either not saving the government money or putting vulnerable people at risk.\u201d</p> <p>The Resolution Foundation says 47% of families who receive these incapacity benefits come from the bottom 30% of the income distribution.</p> <p>Mikey Erhardt, campaigner at Disability Rights UK, which works to improve the rights of disabled people, said: \u201cIt is farcical for the Labour government to be resurrecting Conservative legislation that would subject hundreds of thousands of us to reassessments and conditionalityinstead of the support we need.</p> <p>\u201cCarrying on the last government\u2019s proposed changes to the work capability assessment process would prove that we are living under a government pursuing ever more surveillance of our lives \u2013 another government happy to gamble disabled lives by subjecting us to increased benefit sanctions and eroding rights.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cChanges to the \u2018substantial risk\u2019 rule are reckless and dangerous. It is already a state failure that this is often the only route people who experience mental ill-health and distress can access the support we need. With over 600 benefits-related deaths in the last three years, many of which were suicides as a result of benefit sanctions, pushing disabled people who experience mental distress into work should be the furthest from this government\u2019s priorities.\u201d</p> <p>A DWP spokesperson said: \u201cSpiralling inactivity and millions of people denied the right support is holding the country back and stifling the economy.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe the work capability assessment is not working and needs to be reformed or replaced, alongside a proper plan to support disabled people.</p> <p>\u201cWe will deliver the change the country needs; supporting those who can work, into work, and delivering growth in every part of the country.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rachel Reeves is coming under intense pressure to use the budget to abandon a \u00a31.3bn cut to benefits for people with disabilities, first announced by the Tory government, amid warnings it will lead to hundreds of thousands of the most vulnerable people losing almost \u00a35,000 a year. The leading independent thinktank, the Resolution Foundation, has called on the chancellor to drop or delay changes to the work capability assessment (WCA), arguing that key aspects of the policy have not been thought through, and that around 420,000 people who are unable to work through disability or ill-health could lose up to \u00a34,900 a year. The controversy is another headache for the government, particularly as the savings from the Tory-conceived plan are already baked into the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s forecasts for the public finances that will underpin the budget on 30 October. This latest dispute over benefits cuts follows outcries over the government\u2019s plan to limit winter fuel payments to only the poorest pensioners, and its refusal to end the two-child benefit cap that is being blamed for tipping many thousands more children into poverty every month. Mike Brewer, interim chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said the plan should be scrapped or at least rethought: \u201cThese changes disproportionately affect lower-income households, and could lead to individuals missing out on support, in spite of being at substantial risk of harm, opening up the government to legal challenges. \u201cMinisters are right to scrutinise fast-rising disability benefit spending. But these changes have not been thought through properly. They should be delayed \u2013 if not cancelled \u2013 until they are.\u201d The changes to the WCA were first announced by former Tory chancellor Jeremy Hunt last September. They are due to take effect from April 2025, with a final judgment on whether to proceed expected to be announced in Reeves\u2019s budget. Over the next six years, expenditure on both working-age incapacity and disability benefits is projected to increase rapidly from \u00a343bn in 2022-23 to \u00a363bn in 2028-29, a real-terms increase of \u00a321bn (or 48%). As a result, Hunt announced changes to the current system with a new regime that was sold to the public as help for getting people into work, but which disabilities groups now say will simply make it harder for those most in need of state help to access the benefits they need. In particular, the Resolution Foundation is critical of plans to remove the \u201csubstantial risk\u201d descriptor (which enables people to receive benefits on the grounds of ill-health if not doing so is judged to pose a substantial risk to their physical and mental health), saying this has not been fully thought through. It says: \u201cThis change risks making the process too stringent, and risks either not saving the government money or putting vulnerable people at risk.\u201d The Resolution Foundation says 47% of families who receive these incapacity benefits come from the bottom 30% of the income distribution. Mikey Erhardt, campaigner at Disability Rights UK, which works to improve the rights of disabled people, said: \u201cIt is farcical for the Labour government to be resurrecting Conservative legislation that would subject hundreds of thousands of us to reassessments and conditionalityinstead of the support we need. \u201cCarrying on the last government\u2019s proposed changes to the work capability assessment process would prove that we are living under a government pursuing ever more surveillance of our lives \u2013 another government happy to gamble disabled lives by subjecting us to increased benefit sanctions and eroding rights.\u201d He added: \u201cChanges to the \u2018substantial risk\u2019 rule are reckless and dangerous. It is already a state failure that this is often the only route people who experience mental ill-health and distress can access the support we need. With over 600 benefits-related deaths in the last three years, many of which were suicides as a result of benefit sanctions, pushing disabled people who experience mental distress into work should be the furthest from this government\u2019s priorities.\u201d A DWP spokesperson said: \u201cSpiralling inactivity and millions of people denied the right support is holding the country back and stifling the economy. \u201cWe believe the work capability assessment is not working and needs to be reformed or replaced, alongside a proper plan to support disabled people. \u201cWe will deliver the change the country needs; supporting those who can work, into work, and delivering growth in every part of the country.\u201d",

The judge, Kevin Palmer, said: \u201cHe believed it would have been more insulting to give her the card than not to give her a card at all.\u201d The tribunal was told that two men also laid off during \u201crestructuring\u201d at the company, which also owns airlines Aer Lingus and Iberia, did not receive leaving cards either. Conaghan, a former business liaison lead, brought 40 complaints against the company for sexual harassment, victimisation and unfair dismissal. But the tribunal dismissed every claim, with Palmer concluding that Conaghan, who started working at the company in 2019, had adopted a \u201cconspiracy-theory mentality\u201d, mistaking \u201cnormal workplace interactions\u201d for harassment. In one claim, she said a colleague had copied her use of the word \u201cwhiz\u201d in a card for a colleague, but corrected her spelling by writing \u201cwhizz\u201d instead. She said another employee had asked her: \u201cAre you taking the piss, Karen?\u201d The tribunal heard that this was after Conaghan suggested she had \u201cdone all of the hard work\u201d and it was his \u201cturn to do some\u201d. Conaghan moved to Richmond, North Yorkshire, in September 2021 despite it being expected that all employees live within two hours of the office in Heathrow, the tribunal heard. She was made redundant in the same year as part of a restructuring of the organisation, with colleagues saying in evidence that many people also left around the same time. Judge Palmer said that although further signatures were gathered on the leaving card after her departure, a former colleague took the view that \u201cit was inappropriate to send such a card to [her] at a later date as she had raised a grievance against him and [another colleague]\u201d. Many of the acts cited in the claim \u201ceither did not happen or, if they did happen, they were innocuous interactions in the normal course of employment\u201d, the judge ruled. He said that there was no evidence to suggest that any of Conaghan\u2019s allegations were in any way related to her sex and that one of the allegations was indicative of her \u201cview of normal interactions being something more sinister\u201d. In another, unrelated case earlier this year, an employment tribunal judge ruled that sending an employee an unwanted birthday card could amount to \u201cunwanted conduct\u201d and harassment.",

      "body": "<p>In Din\u00e9, or Navajo, culture, the horse symbolizes strength and resilience, as well as a connection to the earth. Cowboy culture is so relevant to Native communities, that horseback trail rides are used to draw awareness to issues within the community including suicide prevention, and alcohol and drug use, said Allie Young, a 34-year-old Din\u00e9 grassroots organizer. This fall, Young has harnessed the trail ride to engage Din\u00e9 voters for the presidential election: her group\u2019s voter-registration events will culminate with 100 Indigenous voters riding on horseback to a polling station in Arizona on election day.</p> <p>\u201cWhen one mounts a horse and is in rhythm with the horse, that reconnection happens,\u201d Young, founder of the Indigenous-led civic engagement program Protect the Sacred, told the Guardian. \u201cSo when we\u2019re connected with the horse, we\u2019re then reconnected to Mother Earth and reminded of our cultural values and what we\u2019re fighting for, what we\u2019re protecting.\u201d</p> <p>Native American turnout is especially critical in the upcoming election, when tribal sovereignty could be threatened by the conservative blueprint <a href=\"https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-16.pdf\">Project 2025</a>, which states that fossil fuel drilling should be facilitated on tribal lands. Political representation that brings needed resources into Native communities is particularly important on tribal lands, where <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12129#:~:text=Tribal%20Surface%20Transportation%20System&amp;text=About%2011%2C500%20miles%20of%20roads,tribal%2Dsystem%20roads%20are%20unpaved.\">75% of roads remain unpaved</a>.

That year, up to 90% of the roughly 67,000 eligible voters in the Navajo Nation voted for Joe Biden, according to <a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/indigenous-affairs-how-indigenous-voters-swung-the-2020-election/\">data</a>.</p> <p>Young said she hopes that the success of the Ride to the Polls campaign in 2020 and 2022 will encourage \u201cthe greatest Native turnout ever\u201d in the upcoming election. This year, the campaign has extended its reach with events such as skateboarding and bull-riding competitions, heavy metal and country music concerts.</p>    <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to communicate to our community that we need to protect our tribal sovereignty,\u201d said Young, \u201cand with that, protect our sacred sites, protect our lands, our cultures, our languages, our traditions.\u201d</p> <p>Young launched the Ride to the Polls campaign in 2020 in response to the rapid spread of Covid-19 infections in the Navajo Nation, where <a href=\"https://azcir.org/news/2022/12/28/covid-excess-deaths-indigenous-community-response-arizona/\">some counties saw the highest death rates per capita in the nation</a>. She wanted to ensure that her community filled out the US census to receive the funding they deserved and to elect politicians who prioritize the concerns of Native communities.</p> <p>\u201cOur nation and many tribal nations across the country were devastated by the onset of Covid-19 because our system is being chronically underfunded,\u201d said Young, \u201cwhich revealed to the rest of the world what we already know: that the government is not honoring our treaty, which says that we are to receive good healthcare and education.\u201d She began creating culturally relevant initiatives so that young Din\u00e9 citizens who felt disenfranchised would see voting as a tool to \u201crebuild our power as a community\u201d.</p> <p>The campaign\u2019s goal in 2024 is to register 1,500 new voters during their in-person initiatives and more than 5,000 voters through online efforts. So far, they have registered 200 new voters and checked or updated the registrations of about 400 people.</p> <p>On 12 October, the actor Mark Ruffalo will join Ride to the Polls to help mobilize Native voters and to mark the 100th anniversary of Native Americans being granted the right to vote. Ruffalo and Indigenous voters wearing traditional clothing will walk three miles to vote early at a community ballot drop box in Fort Defiance, Arizona \u2013 the site where the forced removal called the <a href=\"https://www.intermountainhistories.org/items/show/191\">Long Walk of the Navajo</a> began in 1863.</p>    <p>\u201cIndigenous people have only been able to fight for their future at the ballot box for 76 years,\u201d Ruffalo said in a statement. \u201cNow we\u2019re seeing a massive movement of young Indigenous folk exercise their power at the polls \u2026 I hope their resilience will inspire other young Indigenous folks from all communities to do the same.\u201d</p> <p>While US citizenship was granted to most Native Americans under the<a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/item/today-in-history/june-02/#:~:text=to%20this%20page-,Indian%20Citizenship%20Act,barred%20Native%20Americans%20from%20voting.\"> Indian Citizenship Act of 1924</a>, <a href=\"https://publicintegrity.org/politics/elections/redistricting-fight-for-native-american-representation/\">some state constitutions continued to block</a> the voting rights of Native Americans who lived among their nations. In <a href=\"https://arizonahistoricalsociety.org/2020/07/15/fighting-for-a-voice-native-americans-right-to-vote-in-arizona/\">Arizona</a>, pollsters required English literacy tests to cast a ballot. All Native Americans were finally granted the right to vote under the federal voting rights act of 1965.</p> <p>Still, barriers have remained that make it difficult for Din\u00e9 to register to vote and cast ballots, including a lack of residential addresses since many people on the Navajo Nation use post office boxes. It also can take up to an hour to drive to a polling location, said Young. And this summer, the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/08/22/nx-s1-5084146/voter-registration-arizona-supreme-court-citizenship\">US supreme court ruled</a> that Arizona can enforce a state law requiring prospective voters to include proof of US citizenship in registration forms, which Young said was a \u201cslap in the face to Native Americans, who are the first peoples of this land, to be asked to prove their citizenship\u201d.</p> <p>To help address some of those hurdles, Protect the Sacred is partnering with the Indigenous-led voter-engagement non-profit Arizona Native Vote. Indigenous organizers register voters and help residents find their addresses by locating their houses on Google Maps. \u201cA key talking point when we talk to voters is letting them know that voting and registering to vote should not be this hard,\u201d Jaynie Parrish, executive director of Arizona Native Vote, said. \u201cFor example, the form itself \u2013 what will take five minutes or less from someone in Flagstaff or Phoenix or in a city that has a physical address or town, that\u2019s not what happens here.\u201d</p> <p>During a six-stop trail ride to register Din\u00e9 citizens throughout the Navajo Nation in mid-September, Indigenous organizers discussed with voters the importance of casting ballots in every election. They served citizens stew and frybread while explaining to them that county elections can determine how local government operations are funded. Young said: \u201cI believe that we started a movement around the power of the Native vote.\u201d</p>",

Raised in&nbsp;south-east London, she broke into the alternative comedy scene in the 1980s as a regular at the Comedy Store. Lederer went on to appear in Britain\u2019s seminal sitcoms \u2013 The Young Ones, Bottom, One Foot in the Grave, French and Saunders and Absolutely Fabulous. She has written the books Coping with Helen Lederer, Single Minding, and the novels Finger Food and <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/losing-it-9781447267645/\">Losing It</a>. She has a daughter, Hannah, with her first husband, the former editor of the Observer Roger Alton.

I\u2019m holding a tray of canapes including Weetabix, some kind of red jus, and Liquorice Allsorts on a skewer. There was one version of the photo, taken in a draughtier moment, in which a nipple was very much visible through the shirt.</p> <p>When this was taken, I don\u2019t think I&nbsp;had started on slimming pills \u2013 but I&nbsp;would have discovered them quite soon after, as I realised you could get them easily from your GP.

We had created Coping together, along with the writer Richard McBrien. That whole period felt like the beginning of&nbsp;a new stage of my life; a peak in which I started to make things happen for myself. I had a book out, I was in a play with the famous actor Denis Quilley. I was living the dream. Then I&nbsp;met a man.</p> <p>A man named Roger \u2013 a different Roger \u2013 came along to the book launch of Coping, which took place in a brightly lit room in the Groucho Club. I&nbsp;felt slightly hysterical that night; almost in disbelief that here we were, with an actual book to promote. In&nbsp;spite of the hysteria, I knew when I&nbsp;was introduced to Roger that I\u2019d marry him. But also divorce him. The&nbsp;divorce part I knew about, because&nbsp;in junior school, my friend Mary James had looked at the number of creases in my thumb and gravely confirmed I would both marry and divorce the same man when I grew up. Mary was very prophetic: I got pregnant, married and separated, all of which took me 18 months.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>For a lot of my life I have been at war\u00a0with myself. Now I am in my 60s,\u00a0I\u2019d like to think I am a bit wiser</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There was sadness when we broke up, but honestly, I just got on with it. I&nbsp;had no other choice; there was a certain war-like spirit to being a single mum in the 90s. It wasn\u2019t really spoken about. At the time, Ben Elton was doing political and observational stuff. Comics were expected to talk about Thatcher, and none appeared to be talking about breastfeeding or dating after marriage. Or nappy bags. All that unsexy stuff I put into my 1991&nbsp;show Hysteria and the book Single&nbsp;Minding.</p> <p><strong>Did becoming a mum hold me back?</strong> There was an immediate disinterest from agents and producers at my motherhood status, without it actually&nbsp;being said. And practically speaking, it was often hard. There was&nbsp;one play I was offered \u2013 a tour with Les Dennis. I wanted to do it and said yes, but when the time came closer I couldn\u2019t manage the thought of being away from Hannah.</p> <p>I was very used to feeling slightly out of sync with the rest of the industry. Because I went to drama school when I was 27, I\u2019ve always been&nbsp;about three years older than my&nbsp;more successful contemporaries. Did it make me feel like an outsider? I&nbsp;wasn\u2019t ever part of a group, even though I performed with many. Self-starting, doing it alone, was something I always did.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/sep/28/alexander-armstrong-and-ben-miller-look-back-we-were-really-cross-with-each-other-slamming-the-door-and-saying-thats-it\">Alexander Armstrong and Ben Miller look back: \u2018We were really cross with each other, slamming the door and saying: That\u2019s it\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before comedy, I had a stint at trying to be a social worker \u2013 I wanted to try to be useful, and to earn some money. Then, a few years before this was taken, I did a postgraduate year at drama school. After that, I knew I had to pursue performing. I was happy at drama school \u2013 that was a big deal for me, as I don\u2019t really do happiness; it\u2019s not generally my thing. For an anxious person, I had such confidence in what I&nbsp;wanted to do and where I wanted to go. I was committed and excited about the world of comedy. It wasn\u2019t success that I was chasing, and being in showbiz wasn\u2019t even part of it. It was just trying to get the job done, find new projects and to keep working.</p> <p>I\u2019m always in heaven when I\u2019m playing with a group of other people; nice people. Meeting Rik [Mayall] in Edinburgh in the early 1980s, I recognised how special he was. Similarly, I knew Ab Fab was different straight away, partly from the way the top BBC people behaved to the \u201cprincipals\u201d. Its appeal was in the genius of Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley and the rest of the cast, but it was also great timing \u2013 we needed a caricature that mirrored the PR world and the excess of the era. The TV show Happy Families with Ben Elton and Dawn French was another nice memory. Everyone went off to get their own series, apart from me. But that\u2019s OK, because we were filming near Alton Towers and we got to go on a big dipper.</p> <p>In spite of being on those TV series,&nbsp;I\u2019ve never felt famous. Naked Video [the BBC Scotland sketch show that ran from 1986 to 1991] was the only experience I had of people writing fan letters to me. I actually couldn\u2019t read them \u2013 I had to get a friend to answer them for me as I found it too weird. I wasn\u2019t sure what to write back.</p> <p><strong>For a while I </strong><strong>felt part of something</strong>. But in my 40s, I sulked a lot. I tried to&nbsp;get comedy scripts accepted and&nbsp;had good agents to promote me, but it would often lead to more meetings and then finally a \u201cno\u201d. I&nbsp;allowed myself to be very disheartened for a while. I thought having a sitcom would be inevitable \u2013 and so did the other people around me \u2013 which didn\u2019t help.</p> <p>For a lot of my life I have been at war&nbsp;with myself. Now I am in my 60s,&nbsp;I\u2019d like to think I am a bit wiser. I&nbsp;still feel a big responsibility to be authentic and true, and I just keep trying. When things go wrong, I\u2019m that mix of being very strong and very&nbsp;frail, but as I\u2019ve had more experience, I know that nothing can be that bad. If I go into a room I know I can work it. It has taken me this long to have that confidence \u2013 I certainly didn\u2019t have that with Coping.</p> <p>The culmination of the mistakes and the rejection messages left on answer machines over the decades have built me up to know that all things pass. There\u2019s always hope, there\u2019s always another idea. There\u2019s always a laugh round the corner.</p>",

Mary was very prophetic: I got pregnant, married and separated, all of which took me 18 months. There was sadness when we broke up, but honestly, I just got on with it. I had no other choice; there was a certain war-like spirit to being a single mum in the 90s. It wasn\u2019t really spoken about. At the time, Ben Elton was doing political and observational stuff. Comics were expected to talk about Thatcher, and none appeared to be talking about breastfeeding or dating after marriage. Or nappy bags. All that unsexy stuff I put into my 1991 show Hysteria and the book Single Minding. Did becoming a mum hold me back? There was an immediate disinterest from agents and producers at my motherhood status, without it actually being said. And practically speaking, it was often hard. There was one play I was offered \u2013 a tour with Les Dennis. I wanted to do it and said yes, but when the time came closer I couldn\u2019t manage the thought of being away from Hannah. I was very used to feeling slightly out of sync with the rest of the industry. Because I went to drama school when I was 27, I\u2019ve always been about three years older than my more successful contemporaries. Did it make me feel like an outsider? I wasn\u2019t ever part of a group, even though I performed with many. Self-starting, doing it alone, was something I always did. Before comedy, I had a stint at trying to be a social worker \u2013 I wanted to try to be useful, and to earn some money. Then, a few years before this was taken, I did a postgraduate year at drama school. After that, I knew I had to pursue performing. I was happy at drama school \u2013 that was a big deal for me, as I don\u2019t really do happiness; it\u2019s not generally my thing. For an anxious person, I had such confidence in what I wanted to do and where I wanted to go. I was committed and excited about the world of comedy. It wasn\u2019t success that I was chasing, and being in showbiz wasn\u2019t even part of it. It was just trying to get the job done, find new projects and to keep working. I\u2019m always in heaven when I\u2019m playing with a group of other people; nice people. Meeting Rik [Mayall] in Edinburgh in the early 1980s, I recognised how special he was. Similarly, I knew Ab Fab was different straight away, partly from the way the top BBC people behaved to the \u201cprincipals\u201d. Its appeal was in the genius of Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley and the rest of the cast, but it was also great timing \u2013 we needed a caricature that mirrored the PR world and the excess of the era. The TV show Happy Families with Ben Elton and Dawn French was another nice memory. Everyone went off to get their own series, apart from me. But that\u2019s OK, because we were filming near Alton Towers and we got to go on a big dipper. In spite of being on those TV series, I\u2019ve never felt famous. Naked Video [the BBC Scotland sketch show that ran from 1986 to 1991] was the only experience I had of people writing fan letters to me. I actually couldn\u2019t read them \u2013 I had to get a friend to answer them for me as I found it too weird. I wasn\u2019t sure what to write back. For a while I felt part of something. But in my 40s, I sulked a lot. I tried to get comedy scripts accepted and had good agents to promote me, but it would often lead to more meetings and then finally a \u201cno\u201d. I allowed myself to be very disheartened for a while. I thought having a sitcom would be inevitable \u2013 and so did the other people around me \u2013 which didn\u2019t help. For a lot of my life I have been at war with myself. Now I am in my 60s, I\u2019d like to think I am a bit wiser. I still feel a big responsibility to be authentic and true, and I just keep trying. When things go wrong, I\u2019m that mix of being very strong and very frail, but as I\u2019ve had more experience, I know that nothing can be that bad. If I go into a room I know I can work it. It has taken me this long to have that confidence \u2013 I certainly didn\u2019t have that with Coping. The culmination of the mistakes and the rejection messages left on answer machines over the decades have built me up to know that all things pass. There\u2019s always hope, there\u2019s always another idea. There\u2019s always a laugh round the corner.",

The GDP of the US is $26tn, so this combined loss is nearly 2% [of that],\u201d Joel Myers, founder and executive president of AccuWeather, said in the estimate.</p> <p>The losses, he said, will be mainly focused in the fourth quarter of this year, and the first quarter of 2025.</p> <p>\u201cThat may wipe out all expected growth in the economy over that period,\u201d he said.</p> <p>There are more immediate concerns at state level, including how Helene and Milton might affect the smooth running of next month\u2019s general election. County elections supervisors and their staffs have been assessing damage to buildings. DeSantis signed a number of executive orders after Hurricane Helene loosening voting rules to ensure as many people as possible could cast their ballot.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know of any offices that have been affected so badly they\u2019re not operational, I think the only thing they\u2019re looking at right now is power, the actual buildings are OK,\u201d said Travis Hart, president of the Florida Supervisors of Elections organization that represents supervisors in all 67 counties.</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t compiled everything yet, and some are out right now checking their polling places and polling sites.

      "body": "<p>Tightening poll figures have triggered nervousness and anxiety in Kamala Harris\u2019s presidential campaign, with Donald Trump making gains in the states where it matters most as the election race enters its climactic final phase.</p> \n<p>Amid a dramatic news cycle that has seen the US hit by two destructive hurricanes and rising fears of all-out war in the Middle East, the Guardian\u2019s 10-day polling average tracker showed the vice-president and Democratic nominee with a two-point nationwide lead, 48% to 46%, over her Republican opponent as of 10 October - tellingly, down from a 4% advantage she registered two weeks ago.</p> \n<p>More plainly worrying for the Democrats is the picture it paints in what are generally regarded as the seven key battleground states that will determine who ends up in the White House: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.</p> \n<p>All seven show minuscule differences between the candidates that are within the margin of error.

      "bodyText": "Tightening poll figures have triggered nervousness and anxiety in Kamala Harris\u2019s presidential campaign, with Donald Trump making gains in the states where it matters most as the election race enters its climactic final phase. Amid a dramatic news cycle that has seen the US hit by two destructive hurricanes and rising fears of all-out war in the Middle East, the Guardian\u2019s 10-day polling average tracker showed the vice-president and Democratic nominee with a two-point nationwide lead, 48% to 46%, over her Republican opponent as of 10 October - tellingly, down from a 4% advantage she registered two weeks ago. More plainly worrying for the Democrats is the picture it paints in what are generally regarded as the seven key battleground states that will determine who ends up in the White House: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. All seven show minuscule differences between the candidates that are within the margin of error. Crucially, Harris enjoys just three \u2013 fractional leads in Nevada and Michigan, and a slim one-point advantage in Pennsylvania. Trump has wafer-thin leads in the four remaining swing states. If that were to be replicated when voters go to the polls on 5 November, it would get Trump past the 270 electoral college votes threshold needed for victory and propel him back to the Oval Office. The crumb of comfort for Harris is that, with multiple surveys telling contradictory tales when the details are scrutinised, that particular outcome probably won\u2019t happen. Indeed, a simulation using polling, economic and demographic data from FiveThirtyEight still had Harris winning the election 55 times out of 100, as of Thursday lunchtime. And a Wall Street Journal survey on Friday also painted a brighter outlook by showing Harris maintaining slight leads in Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia \u2013 enough to give her a narrow electoral college win if borne out on polling day. Yet the margins are perplexing for Democratic strategists, given that the vice-president\u2019s campaign recently disclosed that it had raised $1bn within 80 days of Harris replacing Joe Biden as the party\u2019s nominee in July. The amount greatly surpasses that raised by Trump\u2019s campaign. By late August, Trump\u2019s campaign had brought in a relatively modest $309m, although it has the advantage of financial support from entrepreneur Elon Musk\u2019s Super Pac, which is offering cash incentives to people in swing states to register Trump-friendly voters. Whatever the cash advantages, Harris seems to have lost some momentum in the \u201cblue wall\u201d Rust belt battlegrounds of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania since her 10 September debate performance against Trump in Philadelphia, when she was generally seen as coming out on top. That was illustrated by a Quinnipiac University poll last Wednesday that recorded the five-point lead she held in Michigan in the week following the debate being transformed into a three-point advantage for Trump, 50% to 47%; in Wisconsin, a one-point post-debate advantage turned into a 2% lead for Trump. And in Pennsylvania, a six-point Harris lead was halved to 3%. One issue casting a shadow over Harris\u2019s prospects is the intensifying conflict in the Middle East, with Israel\u2019s offensive against Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese Shia group, threatening to further erode support among the large ethnic Arab voting bloc in Michigan that was already angry over the White House\u2019s backing of the Israeli war against Hamas in Gaza. Quinnipiac\u2019s survey shows Trump with significant leads on the issue in both Michigan and Wisconsin. Trump has apparently become so confident of victory that he has begun moving beyond the battlegrounds to stage rallies in Democratic strongholds such as California, Illinois and New York, despite polls indicating he has little chance of winning there. The move seems calculated to project an air of impending triumph. With just 24 days left before polling day, time is running out for Harris to correct her poll stutters, Democratic strategists fear. The timetable has been further curtailed by the twin storms, Hurricanes Helene and Milton, that have buffeted the south-east of the US in the past two weeks, diverting Harris from the campaign trail and presenting Trump with an opportunity to spout lies and falsehoods about her and Biden\u2019s supposed failure to mount a recovery effort. \u201cI\u2019m very, very concerned and very scared,\u201d James Carville, the acknowledged mastermind of Bill Clinton\u2019s successful 1992 campaign and author of its signature slogan \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid,\u201d \u2013 told MSNBC last week. Warning of limited time for Harris to communicate a more aggressive message to voters, Carville continued: \u201cToday is gone.

      "body": "<p>In 2015, the South African comedian Trevor Noah was plucked from relative obscurity to succeed Jon Stewart as the host of The Daily Show. On its face this seemed an unenviable task; Stewart had hosted for 16 years and it seemed unclear what the show would even be independent of his liberal bona fides and New York sensibility. But Noah\u2019s wit and insight quickly made him a darling of the US left and by bringing an outsider\u2019s perspective \u2013 both as a Black man and a recent immigrant \u2013 to late-night TV, Noah successfully pushed the show into the social media age.</p> <p>Since departing in 2022, Noah has kept busy, launching a podcast, hosting the Grammys, and winning the prestigious Erasmus prize in 2023. He\u2019s now publishing his first children\u2019s book, Into the Uncut Grass. A spiritual successor to his bestselling memoir, Born a Crime, it\u2019s a coming-of-age story written in the shadow of the last days of apartheid. He sat down for a grilling about his inspiration, influences and creative process from a gaggle of fellow authors.</p> <p><strong>I think people will be surprised to see that Into the Uncut Grass is kind of a picture book. Did the idea take </strong><em><strong>you</strong></em><strong> by surprise, too? </strong><em>Frank Cottrell-Boyce, children\u2019s laureate 2024-2026</em><br>No it didn\u2019t because it was something I\u2019ve always wanted to do. It\u2019s an idea I have always romanticised&nbsp;because the picture books I grew up&nbsp;with, like Where the Wild Things Are, were some&nbsp;of&nbsp;my favourite fables and stories. Children\u2019s picture books don\u2019t allow you to spend 400 pages getting into intricate details. I guess what surprised me was how hard it is to actually do, being so concise while containing feeling and emotion.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Jon Stewart was gracious enough to show me how much people didn\u2019t believe in him when he started. He was slammed by the critics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>What was the spark \u2013 the first seed of an idea \u2013 that&nbsp;got you started on this story? </strong><em>Harlan Coben</em><em>, mystery novel author</em><br>The seed was going to therapy and realising the reasons adults can\u2019t resolve conflict is because of&nbsp;things we were not taught as children: how to&nbsp;communicate through a disagreement; how to&nbsp;hold&nbsp;conflicting but equally valid opinions; how&nbsp;to&nbsp;compromise; how to see ourselves in relation&nbsp;to others. We are not taught these things as&nbsp;children, and then we wonder why as adults we struggle to come to those realisations. It\u2019s much harder when you\u2019re an adult because you\u2019re entrenched in your views of the world. So the spark&nbsp;was thinking: what would some of those lessons be and how would those lessons be necessary in today\u2019s world?</p> <p><strong>Like you, I\u2019ve written about my mother in fiction and memoir. What positive effects have</strong><strong> writing about your mother-son relationship had on that relationship in real life? </strong><em>Dean Atta</em><em>, poet</em><br>One of the biggest positive effects is that it\u2019s forced me in a very active way to think about why I&nbsp;appreciate my mother, and to see her as a human being and not just as a mother. We never really spend time thinking of our parents as human beings because we are tied to them. It helped me understand why I love my mother beyond because you\u2019re supposed to. When you write about somebody, you get to understand all the shades and layers that make them who they are to you.</p> <p><strong>How daunting was it taking over from </strong><strong>Jon Stewart</strong><strong> on The Daily Show and what advice if any did he give? </strong><em>Louis Theroux</em><em>, broadcaster and author</em><br>It was extremely daunting. Just the stress of starting a new position on television that was on every day of the week. Plus I was taking over a beloved position from an institution and a person who had \u2013 and continues to have \u2013 an indelible impression on American politics. The best advice I got was from Jon Stewart himself, who was gracious enough to show me how much people didn\u2019t believe in him when he took over the show. It was before social media, but he was slammed by the critics. People wrote articles about how he was doomed to fail. I think it was really wonderful of him to show me that there was a&nbsp;time when he was doubted and nobody thought he could do it. Now he seemed like the most obvious choice. The advice he gave me was: just grind away until somebody notices what you\u2019ve created.</p>    <p><strong>What was the worst advice you were given as a child? </strong><em>Adam Kay</em><em>, former doctor and writer</em><br>I think the worst advice was that you have to try to fit in. You\u2019d meet somebody you don\u2019t get along with and you\u2019d be told: \u201cJust tolerate it for now.\u201d It\u2019s only in later life that you realise that a prison comes with not being yourself around the people you wish to build a life with. So that was probably the worst advice I got as a kid: people telling me to suck it up so that I could maintain connections with other people in my life. The advice I would give a kid today would be: \u201cBe yourself as much as you can.\u201d Some people you\u2019ll lose along the way, but the ones you keep will know the real you.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People in airplanes who stand up before the plane has stopped fully are the most annoying men and women in the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>You speak many languages. Do you use voice-recognition tech in different languages? </strong><em>Susie Dent</em><em>, Countdown lexicographer and author</em><br>I don\u2019t use any of the talking assistance, actually. I&nbsp;think they\u2019re stilted and stiff, and I spend more time correcting them than actually getting the information that I\u2019m looking for. I wouldn\u2019t even know how many languages they do or don\u2019t speak. How many languages do I speak? It changes depending on how much I get to practise them. Right&nbsp;now I speak \u2026 let me think \u2026 English, Zulu, Afrikaans, Tsonga. My German\u2019s not fluent, but I can get by. I\u2019m trying to learn Spanish, so I\u2019ll call it five and a quarter.</p> <p><strong>Apparently you made 315 jokes about President Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office. What was your favourite? </strong><em>Joel Golby</em><em>, author of </em><em>Four Stars: A Life. Reviewed</em><em>, published by </em><em>Mudlark, out now</em><em> <br></em>I\u2019m going to assume that these jokes were all made on The Daily Show. My only response to that would be I did not make 300 jokes about Trump\u2019s first 100&nbsp;days in office. I would argue that Trump made 300 things happen that were worthy of being joked about in his first 100 days of office. And so I only observed them and commented on them. I think one&nbsp;of my favourites was when he went into the White House and he got the tour from President Obama. It was hilarious to see how easily taken he&nbsp;was by Barack Obama, leaving him a really lovely&nbsp;note. Trump came into the White House almost antagonistically. He had this bluster that he&nbsp;ran his whole campaign with. After he read the&nbsp;note that Obama had left for him on the desk, Trump almost turned into a&nbsp;romantic in a war movie&nbsp;where they were reading a&nbsp;beautiful letter from their love. One of the more funny stories for me&nbsp;was just how he recounted the story of the letter that Obama left for him.</p> <p><strong>Who is the most annoying man and woman in the world you\u2019ve ever met? </strong><em>Konnie Huq</em><em>, TV presenter, screenwriter and children\u2019s author</em><br>The most annoying are people in airplanes who stand up before the plane has stopped fully, pull their bags out of the overhead, and then proceed to block other people from standing up when we\u2019re all trying to get out of the airplane. They are in such a desperate need that they\u2019ll crush you and your family to death so that they can get to the baggage carousel two minutes earlier. I think those are the most annoying men and women in the world. I don\u2019t know their names, nor do I wish to know their names.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019ve just written Shadow Play</strong><strong>, based on the classic TV show UFO from the 1970s. Have you ever had a&nbsp;close encounter</strong><strong> yourself</strong><strong>?</strong> <em>James Swallow, author and scriptwriter</em><br>Sometimes we look up into the skies, but I don\u2019t know. I feel like if extraterrestrials are as advanced as they are, they can probably disguise themselves to be just like us. I\u2019ve met a few people where I\u2019ve thought to myself: \u201cYeah, you\u2019re probably an alien.\u201d I try to be as nice to them as possible so that when they come back and invade, they\u2019ll remember me and think: \u201cOh yeah, that guy was pretty nice. We won\u2019t kill him.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/feb/11/jon-stewart-daily-show-return\">Return of the zing: Jon Stewart is back at The Daily Show, amid a changed world</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>What are the five key elements of a great rollercoaster? </strong><em>Stuart Heritage</em><em>, Guardian writer and children\u2019s author</em><br>I don\u2019t know why it says that I like rollercoasters on my IMDb page. It is true, though. I love rollercoasters. What are some of the key elements? Number one, seating position. Rollercoasters that deviate from the norm have an advantage over rollercoasters where you\u2019re seated in a regular position because your body already feels uncomfortable and primed for something that is going to scare it. A great rollercoaster needs to put you in a position where you are able to see the people beside you. I think it adds to the terror that you\u2019ll experience collectively. Another element of a good rollercoaster is the initial suspense, the initial ascent. It has to have few crazy turns that completely confuse your orientation. You should not know where up is or down. The rollercoaster should also ride around the queue where people are waiting because the suspense is part of how you actually experience the ride. South Africa has many famous things, but we never had a famous rollercoaster. Maybe that\u2019s why I love them. <strong><br><br></strong><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/into-the-uncut-grass-9781399821339/Into%20the%20Uncut%20Grass\">Into the Uncut Grass</a> (illustrated by Sabina Hahn), published by </em><em>John Murray</em><em>, is out now.

Since departing in 2022, Noah has kept busy, launching a podcast, hosting the Grammys, and winning the prestigious Erasmus prize in 2023. He\u2019s now publishing his first children\u2019s book, Into the Uncut Grass. A spiritual successor to his bestselling memoir, Born a Crime, it\u2019s a coming-of-age story written in the shadow of the last days of apartheid. He sat down for a grilling about his inspiration, influences and creative process from a gaggle of fellow authors. I think people will be surprised to see that Into the Uncut Grass is kind of a picture book. Did the idea take you by surprise, too? Frank Cottrell-Boyce, children\u2019s laureate 2024-2026 No it didn\u2019t because it was something I\u2019ve always wanted to do. It\u2019s an idea I have always romanticised because the picture books I grew up with, like Where the Wild Things Are, were some of my favourite fables and stories. Children\u2019s picture books don\u2019t allow you to spend 400 pages getting into intricate details. I guess what surprised me was how hard it is to actually do, being so concise while containing feeling and emotion. What was the spark \u2013 the first seed of an idea \u2013 that got you started on this story? Harlan Coben, mystery novel author The seed was going to therapy and realising the reasons adults can\u2019t resolve conflict is because of things we were not taught as children: how to communicate through a disagreement; how to hold conflicting but equally valid opinions; how to compromise; how to see ourselves in relation to others. We are not taught these things as children, and then we wonder why as adults we struggle to come to those realisations. It\u2019s much harder when you\u2019re an adult because you\u2019re entrenched in your views of the world. So the spark was thinking: what would some of those lessons be and how would those lessons be necessary in today\u2019s world? Like you, I\u2019ve written about my mother in fiction and memoir. What positive effects have writing about your mother-son relationship had on that relationship in real life? Dean Atta, poet One of the biggest positive effects is that it\u2019s forced me in a very active way to think about why I appreciate my mother, and to see her as a human being and not just as a mother. We never really spend time thinking of our parents as human beings because we are tied to them. It helped me understand why I love my mother beyond because you\u2019re supposed to. When you write about somebody, you get to understand all the shades and layers that make them who they are to you. How daunting was it taking over from Jon Stewart on The Daily Show and what advice if any did he give? Louis Theroux, broadcaster and author It was extremely daunting. Just the stress of starting a new position on television that was on every day of the week. Plus I was taking over a beloved position from an institution and a person who had \u2013 and continues to have \u2013 an indelible impression on American politics. The best advice I got was from Jon Stewart himself, who was gracious enough to show me how much people didn\u2019t believe in him when he took over the show. It was before social media, but he was slammed by the critics. People wrote articles about how he was doomed to fail. I think it was really wonderful of him to show me that there was a time when he was doubted and nobody thought he could do it. Now he seemed like the most obvious choice. The advice he gave me was: just grind away until somebody notices what you\u2019ve created. What was the worst advice you were given as a child? Adam Kay, former doctor and writer I think the worst advice was that you have to try to fit in. You\u2019d meet somebody you don\u2019t get along with and you\u2019d be told: \u201cJust tolerate it for now.\u201d It\u2019s only in later life that you realise that a prison comes with not being yourself around the people you wish to build a life with. So that was probably the worst advice I got as a kid: people telling me to suck it up so that I could maintain connections with other people in my life. The advice I would give a kid today would be: \u201cBe yourself as much as you can.\u201d Some people you\u2019ll lose along the way, but the ones you keep will know the real you. You speak many languages. Do you use voice-recognition tech in different languages? Susie Dent, Countdown lexicographer and author I don\u2019t use any of the talking assistance, actually. I think they\u2019re stilted and stiff, and I spend more time correcting them than actually getting the information that I\u2019m looking for. I wouldn\u2019t even know how many languages they do or don\u2019t speak. How many languages do I speak? It changes depending on how much I get to practise them. Right now I speak \u2026 let me think \u2026 English, Zulu, Afrikaans, Tsonga. My German\u2019s not fluent, but I can get by. I\u2019m trying to learn Spanish, so I\u2019ll call it five and a quarter. Apparently you made 315 jokes about President Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office. What was your favourite? Joel Golby, author of Four Stars: A Life. Reviewed, published by Mudlark, out now I\u2019m going to assume that these jokes were all made on The Daily Show. My only response to that would be I did not make 300 jokes about Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office. I would argue that Trump made 300 things happen that were worthy of being joked about in his first 100 days of office. And so I only observed them and commented on them. I think one of my favourites was when he went into the White House and he got the tour from President Obama. It was hilarious to see how easily taken he was by Barack Obama, leaving him a really lovely note. Trump came into the White House almost antagonistically. He had this bluster that he ran his whole campaign with. After he read the note that Obama had left for him on the desk, Trump almost turned into a romantic in a war movie where they were reading a beautiful letter from their love. One of the more funny stories for me was just how he recounted the story of the letter that Obama left for him. Who is the most annoying man and woman in the world you\u2019ve ever met? Konnie Huq, TV presenter, screenwriter and children\u2019s author The most annoying are people in airplanes who stand up before the plane has stopped fully, pull their bags out of the overhead, and then proceed to block other people from standing up when we\u2019re all trying to get out of the airplane. They are in such a desperate need that they\u2019ll crush you and your family to death so that they can get to the baggage carousel two minutes earlier. I think those are the most annoying men and women in the world. I don\u2019t know their names, nor do I wish to know their names. I\u2019ve just written Shadow Play, based on the classic TV show UFO from the 1970s. Have you ever had a close encounter yourself? James Swallow, author and scriptwriter Sometimes we look up into the skies, but I don\u2019t know. I feel like if extraterrestrials are as advanced as they are, they can probably disguise themselves to be just like us. I\u2019ve met a few people where I\u2019ve thought to myself: \u201cYeah, you\u2019re probably an alien.\u201d I try to be as nice to them as possible so that when they come back and invade, they\u2019ll remember me and think: \u201cOh yeah, that guy was pretty nice. We won\u2019t kill him.\u201d What are the five key elements of a great rollercoaster? Stuart Heritage, Guardian writer and children\u2019s author I don\u2019t know why it says that I like rollercoasters on my IMDb page. It is true, though. I love rollercoasters. What are some of the key elements? Number one, seating position. Rollercoasters that deviate from the norm have an advantage over rollercoasters where you\u2019re seated in a regular position because your body already feels uncomfortable and primed for something that is going to scare it. A great rollercoaster needs to put you in a position where you are able to see the people beside you. I think it adds to the terror that you\u2019ll experience collectively. Another element of a good rollercoaster is the initial suspense, the initial ascent. It has to have few crazy turns that completely confuse your orientation. You should not know where up is or down. The rollercoaster should also ride around the queue where people are waiting because the suspense is part of how you actually experience the ride. South Africa has many famous things, but we never had a famous rollercoaster. Maybe that\u2019s why I love them. Into the Uncut Grass (illustrated by Sabina Hahn), published by John Murray, is out now. Noah hosts the weekly Spotify Original podcast What Now? With Trevor Noah. He appears in conversation about his new book in London with Waterstones on 27 November and with Fane on 29 November.",

      "body": "<p>As millions of US residents begin working to file insurance claims on their homes in the aftermath of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, many could be denied, particularly if their homes were damaged by flooding.</p> <p>A quirk in the US home insurance market is that flood insurance is separate from typical home insurance, which usually covers wind damage from hurricanes but not flooding. Homeowners must purchase flood insurance separately if they want their homes protected against flooding.</p> <p>And many don\u2019t. In some areas where Hurricane Helene hit the hardest, less than 1% of homes had flood insurance when the storm hit. In Buncombe county in North Carolina, home to Asheville, only 0.9% of homes had flood insurance, according to <a href=\"https://resilience.iii.org/disasters/floods/#5.98/28.76/-83.516\">data from the Insurance Information Institute</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/11/florida-hurricane-milton-helene-flood-insurance\">Hurricanes refocus attention to scarcity of flood insurance in high-risk Florida</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The number of people with flood insurance in Florida, which was hit by Hurricane Milton two weeks after parts of the state were battered by Helene, is higher than in other parts of the country. But still, the take-up is low. In Sarasota county, which took a direct hit from Milton, just 23% of residents have flood insurance.</p> <p>Just an inch of water can cost a home $25,000, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), and 99% of all counties in the US have been affected by flooding since 1996. But only about 6% of homes have flood insurance, according to the Insurance Information Institute.</p> <p>Most of those with flood insurance have plans under the federal government\u2019s National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), created in the 60s as the private market for flood insurance was nonexistent. Though some private companies offer flood insurance, two-thirds of those with flood insurance have policies with the NFIP.</p> <p>Industry experts say that many homeowners don\u2019t know that their standard home insurance doesn\u2019t cover floods.</p> <p>\u201cWind damage is covered typically by your standard home insurance policy, whereas flood in general is excluded,\u201d said Mark Friedlander, director of corporate communications at the Insurance Information Institute. \u201cFor Hurricane Helene, many people filed claims with their property insurance. Those claims most likely will be denied because it is clearly a flood damage, not a wind damage loss.\u201d</p> <p>Friedlander also said people can underestimate the flood risk for their property and choose to forgo the extra insurance to save money.</p> <p>Unlike home insurance, which is required of all homeowners with federally backed mortgages, only those in Fema-designated high-risk flood zones with mortgages are required to buy flood insurance.</p> <p>The high-risk flood zones are primarily areas where residents have to evacuate should a major storm happen \u2013 but it\u2019s not just these zones that flood. Four out of 10 NFIP flood insurance claims come from outside high-risk flood zones, according to <a href=\"https://www.floodsmart.gov/get-flood-insurance\">Fema</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIf it rains at your home, it could flood at your home,\u201d Friedlander said.</p>    <p>Some countries, like Spain and France, include flooding coverage in standard home insurance, said Carolyn Kousky, associate vice-president for economic and policy at the Environmental Defense Fund, something that would be complicated in the US.</p> <p>\u201cWe have some high-risk people who are low-income and would benefit from a flat fee,\u201d Kousky said. \u201cWe also have areas like Miami where there are very high-income people who are at risk, and the flat fee would sort of subsidize them.\u201d</p> <p>During Hurricane Ian, which wrecked the west coast of Florida in September 2022, the cost of repairing flooding damage took up about a quarter of all uninsured loss. <a href=\"https://www.floods.org/news-views/research-and-reports/estimated-damage-for-hurricane-ian-between-41-billion-and-70-billion/#:~:text=Flood%20loss%20from%20NFIP%20and,%2410%20billion%20and%20%2417%20billion.\">Uninsured flood loss</a> was estimated to be between $10bn and $17bn, while overall uninsured loss was between $41bn to $70bn, according to <a href=\"https://tighepa.com/insurance/insurance-law/hurricane-ian-damage-estimate/#:~:text=Per%20CoreLogic%2C%20uninsured%20flood%20and,between%20%2410%20and%20%2416%20billion.\">CoreLogic</a>.</p> <p>Even after Hurricane Ian, the number of people who purchased flood insurance in Florida jumped just 1%, from 19% to 20% of homeowners in the state, Friedlander said.</p> <p>In Florida, flood insurance can mean at least an additional several hundred dollars a year, and residents in the state are already giving up home insurance altogether because of soaring premiums.</p> <p>About 15% to 20% of Florida homeowners <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article281098653.html\">didn\u2019t have</a> home insurance in 2023, more than the 12% national average, according to the Insurance Information institute.</p> <p>Though home insurance premiums have gone up 52% since 2020 nationally, some places in Florida have seen increases of at least 80% during the same period, according to <a href=\"https://static.icemortgagetechnology.com/pdf/ICE_Mortgage-Monitor-Report-October-2024.pdf\">ICE Mortgage Monitor</a>. Earlier this year, Florida\u2019s office of insurance regulation reported that the average annual premium rate was about $3,600 \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/average-homeowners-insurance-cost\">national average</a> is $1,915. In some areas of the state, like the Florida Keys, average annual premiums are <a href=\"https://www.wlrn.org/business/2024-08-14/insurance-home-property-premium-citizens\">closer to</a> $7,000.</p> <p>Many national insurance companies have stopped offering new policies in the state or have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/12/florida-farmers-insurance-climate-crisis\">left it completely</a>, leaving residents to buy plans with regional or local insurance companies that are at higher risk for insolvency. Since 2003, 41 Florida insurance companies have declared bankruptcy or have failed, according to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/milton-threatens-upend-shaky-florida-homeowners-insurance-market-2024-10-09/\">Reuters</a> \u2013 more than the number of companies who went insolvent in the rest of the country during the same period.</p> <p>Parintha Sastry, who studied the insurance fallout after Hurricane Irma hit Florida in 2017, said that smaller insurance companies were more likely to leave policyholders with uninsured claims.</p> <p>\u201cIn the places where people were relying on insurers that experienced financial distress, we see that insurance companies were not paying out claims or were not paying enough,\u201d Sastry said. People \u201cthought they were insured, but their insurance was not as reliable as they thought\u201d.</p>    <p>The number of policies taken out through Citizens Property Insurance, the state\u2019s government-run insurance company, has soared over the last few years. Citizens Insurance is meant to provide insurance to homeowners who aren\u2019t able to get coverage through private insurance providers or who are given rates that are at least 20% more than a comparable policy at Citizens.</p> <p>In 2019, Citizens Insurance had just over 420,000 policies. Over the next five years, the number of policies with the company would balloon to 1.4m in 2023. Over the last year, the company has been trying to <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/citizens-insurance-touts-policies-leaving/\">offload</a> policies back into the private sector after the state passed reforms to strengthen the market.</p> <p>It\u2019s unclear whether private insurance companies will fully re-enter Florida\u2019s insurance market. National insurance companies say that the risk of insuring people in the state is too high given its exposure to hurricanes, along with rising construction costs and high <a href=\"https://news.fiu.edu/2022/the-big-reason-florida-insurance-companies-are-failing-isnt-just-hurricane-risk-its-fraud-and-lawsuits\">litigation</a> against insurance companies.

      "bodyText": "As millions of US residents begin working to file insurance claims on their homes in the aftermath of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, many could be denied, particularly if their homes were damaged by flooding. A quirk in the US home insurance market is that flood insurance is separate from typical home insurance, which usually covers wind damage from hurricanes but not flooding. Homeowners must purchase flood insurance separately if they want their homes protected against flooding. And many don\u2019t. In some areas where Hurricane Helene hit the hardest, less than 1% of homes had flood insurance when the storm hit. In Buncombe county in North Carolina, home to Asheville, only 0.9% of homes had flood insurance, according to data from the Insurance Information Institute. The number of people with flood insurance in Florida, which was hit by Hurricane Milton two weeks after parts of the state were battered by Helene, is higher than in other parts of the country. But still, the take-up is low. In Sarasota county, which took a direct hit from Milton, just 23% of residents have flood insurance. Just an inch of water can cost a home $25,000, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), and 99% of all counties in the US have been affected by flooding since 1996. But only about 6% of homes have flood insurance, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Most of those with flood insurance have plans under the federal government\u2019s National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), created in the 60s as the private market for flood insurance was nonexistent. Though some private companies offer flood insurance, two-thirds of those with flood insurance have policies with the NFIP. Industry experts say that many homeowners don\u2019t know that their standard home insurance doesn\u2019t cover floods. \u201cWind damage is covered typically by your standard home insurance policy, whereas flood in general is excluded,\u201d said Mark Friedlander, director of corporate communications at the Insurance Information Institute. \u201cFor Hurricane Helene, many people filed claims with their property insurance. Those claims most likely will be denied because it is clearly a flood damage, not a wind damage loss.\u201d Friedlander also said people can underestimate the flood risk for their property and choose to forgo the extra insurance to save money. Unlike home insurance, which is required of all homeowners with federally backed mortgages, only those in Fema-designated high-risk flood zones with mortgages are required to buy flood insurance. The high-risk flood zones are primarily areas where residents have to evacuate should a major storm happen \u2013 but it\u2019s not just these zones that flood. Four out of 10 NFIP flood insurance claims come from outside high-risk flood zones, according to Fema. \u201cIf it rains at your home, it could flood at your home,\u201d Friedlander said. Some countries, like Spain and France, include flooding coverage in standard home insurance, said Carolyn Kousky, associate vice-president for economic and policy at the Environmental Defense Fund, something that would be complicated in the US. \u201cWe have some high-risk people who are low-income and would benefit from a flat fee,\u201d Kousky said. \u201cWe also have areas like Miami where there are very high-income people who are at risk, and the flat fee would sort of subsidize them.\u201d During Hurricane Ian, which wrecked the west coast of Florida in September 2022, the cost of repairing flooding damage took up about a quarter of all uninsured loss. Uninsured flood loss was estimated to be between $10bn and $17bn, while overall uninsured loss was between $41bn to $70bn, according to CoreLogic. Even after Hurricane Ian, the number of people who purchased flood insurance in Florida jumped just 1%, from 19% to 20% of homeowners in the state, Friedlander said. In Florida, flood insurance can mean at least an additional several hundred dollars a year, and residents in the state are already giving up home insurance altogether because of soaring premiums. About 15% to 20% of Florida homeowners didn\u2019t have home insurance in 2023, more than the 12% national average, according to the Insurance Information institute. Though home insurance premiums have gone up 52% since 2020 nationally, some places in Florida have seen increases of at least 80% during the same period, according to ICE Mortgage Monitor. Earlier this year, Florida\u2019s office of insurance regulation reported that the average annual premium rate was about $3,600 \u2013 the national average is $1,915. In some areas of the state, like the Florida Keys, average annual premiums are closer to $7,000. Many national insurance companies have stopped offering new policies in the state or have left it completely, leaving residents to buy plans with regional or local insurance companies that are at higher risk for insolvency. Since 2003, 41 Florida insurance companies have declared bankruptcy or have failed, according to Reuters \u2013 more than the number of companies who went insolvent in the rest of the country during the same period. Parintha Sastry, who studied the insurance fallout after Hurricane Irma hit Florida in 2017, said that smaller insurance companies were more likely to leave policyholders with uninsured claims. \u201cIn the places where people were relying on insurers that experienced financial distress, we see that insurance companies were not paying out claims or were not paying enough,\u201d Sastry said. People \u201cthought they were insured, but their insurance was not as reliable as they thought\u201d. The number of policies taken out through Citizens Property Insurance, the state\u2019s government-run insurance company, has soared over the last few years. Citizens Insurance is meant to provide insurance to homeowners who aren\u2019t able to get coverage through private insurance providers or who are given rates that are at least 20% more than a comparable policy at Citizens. In 2019, Citizens Insurance had just over 420,000 policies. Over the next five years, the number of policies with the company would balloon to 1.4m in 2023. Over the last year, the company has been trying to offload policies back into the private sector after the state passed reforms to strengthen the market. It\u2019s unclear whether private insurance companies will fully re-enter Florida\u2019s insurance market. National insurance companies say that the risk of insuring people in the state is too high given its exposure to hurricanes, along with rising construction costs and high litigation against insurance companies. In 2023, Farmers Insurance became the first major insurance company to leave the state. It\u2019s a dilemma that is being seen in places across the country that are facing severe weather events linked to the climate crisis. Growing risks related to climate disasters are making it costlier to live in certain places. Major insurance companies have also pulled out of parts of California that are prone to wildfires, leaving residents vulnerable to hundreds of thousands of dollars in costs if their home is destroyed. The climate risk non-profit First Street Foundation has estimated flood risk has distorted the housing market to the tune of at least $121bn \u2013 making some homes seem more valuable than they are because flood risk is unaccounted for. \u201cWe\u2019re in an environment of ever-increasing risk,\u201d Kousky said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for people to get their heads around that.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>I spend a lot of my life being other people, spending years inside the lives of my fictional protagonists, and, when the creative alchemy is going well, it is intensely satisfying. It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t bear being myself, but to be honest, I find other people much more interesting. Creating characters and unravelling their stories is an invigorating and unpredictable adventure into the unknown. It might be daunting sometimes, and I\u2019m never sure of the outcome, but when I\u2019m in the zone, it\u2019s one helluva ride.</p> <p>When I wrote my 2013 novel, Mr&nbsp;Loverman, I felt deliciously consumed by my 74-year-old Caribbean protagonist, Barrington Jedidiah Walker Esq. He arrived easily \u2013 no birthing pains \u2013 and when my husband came home in the evenings, I\u2019d inhabited him so deeply, I found myself unwittingly talking to him in&nbsp;Barrington\u2019s Antiguan accent. \u201cY\u2019all&nbsp;right, spar?\u201d I\u2019d ask him, the boundaries between character and creator momentarily blurred, much to&nbsp;my husband\u2019s amusement.</p> <p>I don\u2019t fall in love with all of my characters, but I had a platonic crush on Barrington, as mad as that sounds. Not because he\u2019s perfect, God forbid, who is? But because he\u2019s a larger-than-life unreliable narrator who is complicated and passionate, with a&nbsp;strong and opinionated internal commentary, who couldn\u2019t wait to regale me with his escapades and lay bare his traumas and dilemmas.</p>    <p>This is a novel of two very long relationships \u2013 public and private. On the surface, Barrington is a traditional family man, married to his deeply religious wife, Carmel, for 50 years. The pair of them arrived from Antigua in 1960 and settled in Stoke Newington in north London, where they still live, conjoined in an increasingly unhappy union. Barrington is also the father of their middle-aged daughters, Donna, a&nbsp;social worker, and Maxine, a fashion stylist, and he\u2019s the grandfather of schoolboy Daniel, privately educated and intent on becoming Britain\u2019s first black prime minister. The family appears pretty conventional, except Barrington leads a double life \u2013 as a closet homosexual. He\u2019s still sexually active with his lover Morris, in an affair that began when they were 14. Carmel has no idea her husband is gay or that their treasured family friend is her husband\u2019s lover.</p> <p>At the start of the novel, Barrington\u2019s marriage is blown apart, and he must decide if he\u2019s going to be brave enough to leave it and live freely as a gay man. He has choices: he\u2019s rich, he bought his&nbsp;house years ago when it was dirt cheap, and he can live anywhere. But he\u2019s terrified, or as he puts it: \u201cI am too used to being in a prison of my own making: judge, jailer and jackass cellmate.\u201d The novel asks the question: what does it mean to spend a lifetime hiding your sexuality, and what are the consequences of this deception on yourself, and those closest to you?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The novel asks the question \u2013 what does it mean to spend a lifetime hiding your sexuality?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Each of my novels has a different starting point \u2013 a character, an era, a theme, a place \u2013 but Mr Loverman had unusual origins. In 2009, as a writing mentor for a development programme, I attended a workshop led by one of my co-mentors, the playwright Rebecca Lenkiewicz. She set an exercise whereby she laid out a selection of old passport photographs on a table, asked each of us to pick one, and to then describe the person in the picture taking their clothes off in front of a mirror while delivering a monologue. Who knew that my chosen photo of a 1950s black man wearing a trenchcoat and hat would produce the character of Barrington? It was a simple prompt, but it generated a voice that so excited me with fictional potential, I went home and continued writing until he had filled a novel.</p> <p>Prior to this I\u2019d spent years on another novel about a Gambian seaman who migrates to Cornwall in the 1900s, yet I never fully managed to&nbsp;bring his character to life. Try as I&nbsp;might, I couldn\u2019t fix it. As soon as Barrington came on the scene, I&nbsp;unceremoniously dumped my Gambian seaman in the bin, salvaging a few thousand words that became a&nbsp;short story.</p>    <p>There are several stages in the lifetime of a novel, which, I believe, begins when it\u2019s unborn, unformed and floating around our subconscious landscapes, long before a single word has been written.

These influences&nbsp;eventually coalesce and&nbsp;metamorphose into fiction. Barrington, who seemed to appear fully formed, actually materialised from the nebula of my imagination.</p> <p>His voice is also influenced by an Antiguan friend I\u2019ve known since we were teenagers. When I wrote him, I&nbsp;heard her. While I\u2019m not from the Caribbean but of British-Nigerian heritage, I\u2019ve been around Caribbean people my entire adult life \u2013 friends, lovers, associates, colleagues. I would have struggled to conceive, let alone write, this novel, without this personal&nbsp;context.</p> <p>Barrington may dominate the novel, but his family give him a run for&nbsp;his money, especially Carmel, who has chapters spliced in between his. He writes in the first person, she writes in the second. He speaks in prose, her sections are poetic. Carmel\u2019s chapters were added to the novel at a late stage after I received feedback from my publisher that the reader only sees her through Barrington\u2019s bitterly negative perspective. Horrified that I\u2019d been so seduced by his charisma that I\u2019d not done Carmel justice, I subsequently gave her the space to tell her side of the story. Barrington is the showman, Carmel the support act. Yet we get to know her intimately, from her troubled childhood through the difficult decades of marriage up to the present day. The women in the novel are significant but secondary figures. In a sense my later novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/08/girl-woman-other-by-bernardine-evaristo-review\">Girl, Woman, Other</a> was written to redress the balance. My books are often in conversation with each other.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always been interested in writing marginalised figures, to fill the silences in our society with fiction from underexplored demographics. When I began writing this novel, I had long registered the overwhelmingly heteronormative portrayal of the Windrush generation, which simply wasn\u2019t representative. It seemed to me that Windrush gays had been erased, although occasionally younger, black gay figures appeared on television or in literature. I became aware that British colonial legislation criminalising sex between men was still prevalent in many Caribbean countries. Barrington was raised under these oppressive laws, which in&nbsp;Antigua and Barbuda were only repealed in 2022.</p> <p>In the novel, Barrington recalls: \u201cI\u2019d&nbsp;been under such pressure back home. A young man showing no interest in girls, when he could have any one of them? I was 24 when I&nbsp;married Carmel, and I\u2019d almost left it&nbsp;too late for some. They was talking, and I was afraid I\u2019d be up before a judge on some trumped-up charge of&nbsp;indecent exposure; or end up lying on an operating table with a bar of wood between my teeth and electric volts destroying parts of my brain for ever; or in the crazy house pumped full of drugs that would eventually drive a sane man mad.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/sep/13/bernardine-evaristo-ive-gone-from-being-a-raging-ranter-in-my-20s-to-a-radical-reasoner-in-my-60s\">Bernardine Evaristo: \u2018I\u2019ve gone from being a raging ranter in my 20s to a radical reasoner in my 60s\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like many of his Caribbean generation, Barrington migrated to Britain expecting a utopia, only to be sorely disappointed.

      "body": "<p>On this windless autumn Saturday, the landscape is curiously hushed. Occasionally, a&nbsp;tiny chorus of coal tits gathers to chat in the pines above my head, but otherwise it\u2019s soundless, the muffled stillness willing me to slow my pace. As the track turns from soil to sand, I skitter over smooth grey rocks to reach a crescent of chalky powder. As I strip down to my swimsuit and slip into the shiveringly crisp water, the sun breaks through and I\u2019m suddenly swimming through rhinestones, amazed to have the coastline to myself.</p>    <p>I\u2019m hiking, solo, two hours south of&nbsp;the Swedish capital, along the <a href=\"https://stockholmarchipelagotrail.com/\">Stockholm Archipelago Trail</a>, a 167-mile (270km) path that has been gradually opening, section by section, this summer before its official launch later this month. It came about thanks to a chance conversation between Marie \u00d6stblom, a project manager for&nbsp;the Stockholm Business Region, and Swimrun co-founder Michael Lemmel, and when all sections are completed later this month, the trail will run between Arholma in the north&nbsp;and Landsort in the south, linking 21 islands.</p> <p>I\u2019m trying out a three-day section of the route at the beginning of what \u00d6stblom calls the archipelago\u2019s \u201cmagic season\u201d \u2013 September, October and early November: \u201cYou get those gorgeous misty mornings but the sun is shining, the leaves are turning gold and the evenings get darker earlier. It\u2019s a chance for cosiness after all the summer light.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>You get those gorgeous misty mornings but the sun is shining, the leaves are turning gold and the evenings get darker earlier. It\u2019s a chance for cosiness after all the summer light</p> <footer> <cite>Marie \u00d6stblom</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The fact that so few people are here to enjoy this season is one of the reasons the trail has been developed. The archipelago\u2019s tourist season is short, running mainly from mid-June to mid-August, the Swedish school holiday period. While there is year-round access, fewer ferries run outside those months and many guesthouses and restaurants close. It\u2019s hoped that the trail will help stretch the season, increase footfall and give local businesses reason to stay open longer.</p> <p>\u201cMaking the trail is just the start,\u201d says \u00d6stblom. \u201cIt would be great if small taxi boats grouped together and designed a booking app, like an archipelago version of Uber. Or if guides, accommodation and bike and kayak hire operators worked together to make trail packages.\u201d</p>    <p>For now, visiting in the magic season means plotting a route around the available transport. To reach the three southern islands I\u2019m hiking I\u2019ve taken a train to Nyn\u00e4shamn, an hour or so south of Stockholm, then a water taxi for the 25-minute hop to N\u00e5ttar\u00f6 (though many of the northern islands can be reached directly by ferry from Stockholm year-round).</p> <p>Thanks to Sweden\u2019s <em>allemansr\u00e4tten</em>, or right to roam, it is possible to visit all year if you bring your own tent and supplies. I, however, am slipping in just before the cabins here close for the season. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Thanks to Sweden\u2019s allemansr\u00e4tten, or right to roam, it is possible to visit all year if you bring your own tent and supplies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m met on the pier by manager Carina Ljung. <a href=\"https://nattaro.se/en/\">N\u00e5ttar\u00f6</a> is a car-free island with the archipelago\u2019s largest sand beach but no year-round residents, and offers what Ljung calls \u201ca traditional Swedish summerhouse experience\u201d, with 49 charmingly back-to-basics cabins, a campsite, hostel, restaurant, grocery store and bike/kayak rental shop. \u201cStaying here reminds people of their childhood,\u201d she says, adding that with no insulation in those cabins and shared showers and compost toilets, they are \u201cvery open to the weather\u201d.</p> <p>Happily, the weather is living up to the magic season tagline.

      "bodyText": "On this windless autumn Saturday, the landscape is curiously hushed. Occasionally, a tiny chorus of coal tits gathers to chat in the pines above my head, but otherwise it\u2019s soundless, the muffled stillness willing me to slow my pace. As the track turns from soil to sand, I skitter over smooth grey rocks to reach a crescent of chalky powder. As I strip down to my swimsuit and slip into the shiveringly crisp water, the sun breaks through and I\u2019m suddenly swimming through rhinestones, amazed to have the coastline to myself. I\u2019m hiking, solo, two hours south of the Swedish capital, along the Stockholm Archipelago Trail, a 167-mile (270km) path that has been gradually opening, section by section, this summer before its official launch later this month. It came about thanks to a chance conversation between Marie \u00d6stblom, a project manager for the Stockholm Business Region, and Swimrun co-founder Michael Lemmel, and when all sections are completed later this month, the trail will run between Arholma in the north and Landsort in the south, linking 21 islands. I\u2019m trying out a three-day section of the route at the beginning of what \u00d6stblom calls the archipelago\u2019s \u201cmagic season\u201d \u2013 September, October and early November: \u201cYou get those gorgeous misty mornings but the sun is shining, the leaves are turning gold and the evenings get darker earlier. It\u2019s a chance for cosiness after all the summer light.\u201d The fact that so few people are here to enjoy this season is one of the reasons the trail has been developed. The archipelago\u2019s tourist season is short, running mainly from mid-June to mid-August, the Swedish school holiday period. While there is year-round access, fewer ferries run outside those months and many guesthouses and restaurants close. It\u2019s hoped that the trail will help stretch the season, increase footfall and give local businesses reason to stay open longer. \u201cMaking the trail is just the start,\u201d says \u00d6stblom. \u201cIt would be great if small taxi boats grouped together and designed a booking app, like an archipelago version of Uber. Or if guides, accommodation and bike and kayak hire operators worked together to make trail packages.\u201d For now, visiting in the magic season means plotting a route around the available transport. To reach the three southern islands I\u2019m hiking I\u2019ve taken a train to Nyn\u00e4shamn, an hour or so south of Stockholm, then a water taxi for the 25-minute hop to N\u00e5ttar\u00f6 (though many of the northern islands can be reached directly by ferry from Stockholm year-round). Thanks to Sweden\u2019s allemansr\u00e4tten, or right to roam, it is possible to visit all year if you bring your own tent and supplies. I, however, am slipping in just before the cabins here close for the season. I\u2019m met on the pier by manager Carina Ljung. N\u00e5ttar\u00f6 is a car-free island with the archipelago\u2019s largest sand beach but no year-round residents, and offers what Ljung calls \u201ca traditional Swedish summerhouse experience\u201d, with 49 charmingly back-to-basics cabins, a campsite, hostel, restaurant, grocery store and bike/kayak rental shop. \u201cStaying here reminds people of their childhood,\u201d she says, adding that with no insulation in those cabins and shared showers and compost toilets, they are \u201cvery open to the weather\u201d. Happily, the weather is living up to the magic season tagline. Like most of the trail, this seven-mile section is a loop, so I can drop my bags in my cabin and walk carrying only a daypack. Within two minutes of shutting the wendy house-like cabin door I\u2019m alone in that silent forest, following the trail to magnificent Stora Sand beach. Further on, the terrain switches from desert island to Zen garden as I pick my way over smooth, moss-cloaked boulders to the island\u2019s highest point.

That evening I sit on the terrace of N\u00e5ttar\u00f6\u2019s one pub/restaurant as the setting sun paints a streak of bright lingonberry across the sky. I pull a blanket over my knees and enjoy rich fish stew before picking my way back to my cabin in the moonlight. Next morning, I catch a waterborne lift with Carina\u2019s husband to continue the trail on nearby \u00c5l\u00f6.

That evening I meet Thomas Hjelm for dinner at Ut\u00f6 V\u00e4rdshus, an elegant inn above Gruvbyn, the historic village at the centre of Ut\u00f6 island that, with its luxury yachts and red-timbered houses, has a hint of \u201cScantucket\u201d about it.

He suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury against Fulham last December, which turned out to be his final game for the club, whom he left at the end of last season. Matip was among the crop of players signed by J\u00fcrgen Klopp in his first summer window at Liverpool. The rangy centre-back, noted for his ability to dribble the ball out of defence, achieved cult hero status among Liverpool fans having arrived on a free transfer and later formed a solid defensive partnership with Virgil van Dijk. Klopp paid tribute to Matip in May this year when the defender\u2019s departure from Liverpool was confirmed. \u201cIn all the years that I have been involved in football, I am not sure I have come across too many players who are more loved than Jo\u00ebl Matip,\u201d said the former manager. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure it would be possible to say anything bad about him. \u201cA wonderful professional, a wonderful footballer and a wonderful human being \u2013 we have been blessed to have him. Jo\u00ebl\u2019s qualities as a player are there for all to see and as a club, we have benefited from them since the moment he joined. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s had too many headlines over the years but he has only ever been a very famous figure within our group. \u201cI have said before that if there was one person who wouldn\u2019t care if he was underrated it would be Jo\u00ebl, but the truth is we could not have rated him more highly.\u201d",

I Will Return, by the playwright Oksana Grytsenko, is a drama about three children from Ukraine who find themselves stranded, unable to return home, in a summer camp in illegally occupied Crimea. The story is a snapshot of an ongoing national trauma. Official government statistics suggest that nearly 20,000 children have been forcibly taken from occupied parts of Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, deported to Russia itself or to areas such as Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. Only a trickle of a few hundred have come home, when parents or guardians, often helped by the charity Save Ukraine, have located and made the perilous journey to collect them. Some have had their names changed and been put up for adoption. The international criminal court has issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and Russia\u2019s children\u2019s rights commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, for the alleged unlawful deportation of children. Grytsenko based her play on detailed interviews with six teenagers who were taken illegally to Crimea ostensibly to protect them from the dangers of war, and then stranded there as parents and guardians struggled to reach them and produce the correct documents to bring them home. She merged characters to protect her interviewees\u2019 privacy, taking care to stay as true to the real situation as possible. That said, the play contains a gut-punching twist that visibly affected the audience at a Kyiv performance: one of her characters does not come home. It does not reflect what happened to her own interviewees, but \u201cit is more truthful, because the majority of these kids, they have not returned\u201d, said Grytsenko.

      "body": "<p>London\u2019s annual international <a href=\"https://danceumbrella.co.uk/festival/\">Dance Umbrella</a> festival is at once a venerable institution and a crucible for the new. Founded by Val Bourne in 1978 and nurtured by Betsy Gregory, this year\u2019s festival is dedicated to the memory of Emma Gladstone, who ran it with pioneering enthusiasm and taste from 2013 to 2021.</p> <p>She died <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/feb/11/emma-gladstone-obituary\">earlier this year</a>, and on opening night the current artistic director, Freddie Opoku-Addaie, who took the reins in 2021, made an emotional speech and asked everyone to dance for her. Like his illustrious predecessors, he is shaping the programme afresh, introducing new global trends, encouraging the new, the bold, the transformative.</p> <p>This year\u2019s festival features five UK premieres and one European one across a variety of spaces, plus an extensive <a href=\"https://danceumbrella.co.uk/digital-pass/\">digital programme</a> available for whatever you can pay. The vibrant tone was set by <strong><a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2024/event/dance-umbrella-hatched-ensemble\">Hatched Ensemble</a></strong>, by the South African choreographer Mamela Nyamza, a formally rigorous and deeply beautiful piece of dance that uses her background as a ballet-trained dancer to raise questions of identity and belonging.</p> <p>Expanded from a solo first seen at Dance Umbrella in 2011, it opens with its 10 dancers sitting quietly in a pool of light as Saint-Sa\u00ebns\u2019 The Dying Swan plays on a loop. They are surrounded by delicate wire sculptures \u2013 swans, cockerels, windmills. Bare-chested, wearing long net tutus held together with pegs, they pull on pink silk pointe shoes and begin to move, arms making graceful arcs, feet a percussive patter, raising the objects like icons of their lives.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LpScbDb_aE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-LpScbDb_aE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LpScbDb_aE\">Watch a trailer for Hatched Ensemble.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>As an opera singer and a traditional African multi-instrumentalist shift the mood, introducing different sections of music, so the dancers constantly \u201chatch\u201d and change, putting on red hats which they hang on the washing line that spans the stage and which are revealed as net dresses and shiny plastic coats.</p> <p>It\u2019s a piece of contrasts, and as the dancers shift the movement stirs and evolves as well. They come off pointe and beat their feet on the stage, the movement more grounded, more African. They pick out different rhythms. At one moment they stand in a group facing the audience, with their stylised makeup \u2013 pink shiny eyes, white lips \u2013 not hiding the personalities that are beginning to emerge, or the challenge they offer. Finally, they peg the ballet shoes on the line before revealing themselves in great slaps of the feet and whirls of liberated, unified dancing. It\u2019s both direct and subtle, cleverly wrought and deeply felt, absolutely stunning to see.</p>    <p>On the festival\u2019s digital programme, Lea Anderson\u2019s film <strong><a href=\"https://danceumbrella.co.uk/event/lea-anderson-the-featherstonehaughs-draw-on-the-sketchbooks-of-egon-schiele/\">The Featherstonehaughs Draw on the Sketchbooks of Egon Schiele</a></strong> gets a world premiere. With her all-male Featherstonehaughs and female Cholmondeleys (who celebrate their 40th anniversary this year), Anderson was once the darling of UK contemporary dance, but over the past decades has rather faded from view.</p> <p>This work, inspired by the expressionist artist Schiele, with music performed live by Steve Blake and Will Saunders, was recorded in 2010, and reveals Anderson\u2019s strengths and her weaknesses.

      "bodyText": "London\u2019s annual international Dance Umbrella festival is at once a venerable institution and a crucible for the new. Founded by Val Bourne in 1978 and nurtured by Betsy Gregory, this year\u2019s festival is dedicated to the memory of Emma Gladstone, who ran it with pioneering enthusiasm and taste from 2013 to 2021. She died earlier this year, and on opening night the current artistic director, Freddie Opoku-Addaie, who took the reins in 2021, made an emotional speech and asked everyone to dance for her. Like his illustrious predecessors, he is shaping the programme afresh, introducing new global trends, encouraging the new, the bold, the transformative. This year\u2019s festival features five UK premieres and one European one across a variety of spaces, plus an extensive digital programme available for whatever you can pay. The vibrant tone was set by Hatched Ensemble, by the South African choreographer Mamela Nyamza, a formally rigorous and deeply beautiful piece of dance that uses her background as a ballet-trained dancer to raise questions of identity and belonging. Expanded from a solo first seen at Dance Umbrella in 2011, it opens with its 10 dancers sitting quietly in a pool of light as Saint-Sa\u00ebns\u2019 The Dying Swan plays on a loop. They are surrounded by delicate wire sculptures \u2013 swans, cockerels, windmills. Bare-chested, wearing long net tutus held together with pegs, they pull on pink silk pointe shoes and begin to move, arms making graceful arcs, feet a percussive patter, raising the objects like icons of their lives. As an opera singer and a traditional African multi-instrumentalist shift the mood, introducing different sections of music, so the dancers constantly \u201chatch\u201d and change, putting on red hats which they hang on the washing line that spans the stage and which are revealed as net dresses and shiny plastic coats. It\u2019s a piece of contrasts, and as the dancers shift the movement stirs and evolves as well. They come off pointe and beat their feet on the stage, the movement more grounded, more African. They pick out different rhythms. At one moment they stand in a group facing the audience, with their stylised makeup \u2013 pink shiny eyes, white lips \u2013 not hiding the personalities that are beginning to emerge, or the challenge they offer. Finally, they peg the ballet shoes on the line before revealing themselves in great slaps of the feet and whirls of liberated, unified dancing. It\u2019s both direct and subtle, cleverly wrought and deeply felt, absolutely stunning to see. On the festival\u2019s digital programme, Lea Anderson\u2019s film The Featherstonehaughs Draw on the Sketchbooks of Egon Schiele gets a world premiere. With her all-male Featherstonehaughs and female Cholmondeleys (who celebrate their 40th anniversary this year), Anderson was once the darling of UK contemporary dance, but over the past decades has rather faded from view. This work, inspired by the expressionist artist Schiele, with music performed live by Steve Blake and Will Saunders, was recorded in 2010, and reveals Anderson\u2019s strengths and her weaknesses. It looks sensational, with costumes by Sandy Powell and makeup by David Hoyle (recreated by Emilie Yong) that turn the dancers into living paintings, sculpted groups emerging from the shadows. The movement is stylised and sophisticated, but also repetitive. It feels overextended by its own artfulness, yet is an important record of a significant force in British dance.

There\u2019s nothing like the impending approach of the latter to add impetus and urgency to the former. In the two years since diagnosis, my cancer-riddled body has allowed me to engage in a surprising amount of living, from a 100-mile ultra running comeback to a two-month walk from John o\u2019Groats to Land\u2019s End. I\u2019ve found new meaning in life, and campaigning for better NHS treatment has led me to the door of No 10 Downing Street.

The Cup\u2019s format pits the defending yacht club, known as the defender, against the challenger in a match race. Each edition of the America\u2019s Cup is organised by the defender, who have the authority to choose the location, date, rules, and boat design for the event.</p> <h2>If it is an international trophy, why is it called the America\u2019s Cup?</h2>  <p>It was initially named the RYS \u00a3100 Cup simply because it was worth \u00a3100 before the American syndicate mistakenly engraved it as the 100 Guinea Cup. It was then named after the winning yacht in the inaugural race around the Isle of Wight: the America. No, they were not particularly creative at naming their boats in the 19th century.</p> <h2>So how does it work?</h2>  <p>Teams must first compete in a series of regattas, culminating in the Louis Vuitton Cup, which determines the main event\u2019s challenger. This year\u2019s matchup will see Team New Zealand as the defender take on Ineos Britannia after the Britons won the right to challenge New Zealand by beating Italy\u2019s Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/04/britain-end-60-year-wait-to-compete-for-americas-cup-after-beating-italy-sailing\">comfortably in the decisive race</a>. The current format features a best of 13 series; the first to win seven races takes home the Cup. This year\u2019s edition begins with the first two races on 12 October. After that, the third and fourth races are set for 13 October. Subsequent races will occur on 16 October for the fifth and sixth races and on 18 October for the seventh. If necessary, the eighth race will be held on 18 October, the ninth and 10th on 19 October, the 11th and 12th on 20 October. The final race, if required, will take place on 21 October.</p>   <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2024/oct/11/ready-about-a-short-history-of-the-americas-cup-in-pictures\">Ready about!

      "bodyText": "What is the America\u2019s Cup? Established in 1851, the America\u2019s Cup is the oldest active trophy in international sports and sailing\u2019s pinnacle competition, where yacht clubs representing different nations compete for the trophy. The Cup\u2019s format pits the defending yacht club, known as the defender, against the challenger in a match race. Each edition of the America\u2019s Cup is organised by the defender, who have the authority to choose the location, date, rules, and boat design for the event. If it is an international trophy, why is it called the America\u2019s Cup? It was initially named the RYS \u00a3100 Cup simply because it was worth \u00a3100 before the American syndicate mistakenly engraved it as the 100 Guinea Cup. It was then named after the winning yacht in the inaugural race around the Isle of Wight: the America. No, they were not particularly creative at naming their boats in the 19th century. So how does it work? Teams must first compete in a series of regattas, culminating in the Louis Vuitton Cup, which determines the main event\u2019s challenger. This year\u2019s matchup will see Team New Zealand as the defender take on Ineos Britannia after the Britons won the right to challenge New Zealand by beating Italy\u2019s Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli comfortably in the decisive race. The current format features a best of 13 series; the first to win seven races takes home the Cup. This year\u2019s edition begins with the first two races on 12 October. After that, the third and fourth races are set for 13 October. Subsequent races will occur on 16 October for the fifth and sixth races and on 18 October for the seventh. If necessary, the eighth race will be held on 18 October, the ninth and 10th on 19 October, the 11th and 12th on 20 October. The final race, if required, will take place on 21 October. And are these teams evenly matched? In terms of history, no. New Zealand have won the Cup four times (1995, 2000, 2017, and 2021) and fall only behind the United States (30) for the most wins. Switzerland have two wins (2003 and 2007) and Australia won once in 1983, breaking the US\u2019s dominance. A Great Britain team have never won the Cup despite making 22 attempts. But in terms of the present day? Well, also no.

She is accompanied only by her surviving daughter Anna, whom she had with Gustav. Anna is presented throughout as a 30-year-old woman, a kind of hypercritical one-woman chorus. \u201cIs there an artist you <em>haven\u2019t</em> slept with?\u201d she wryly asks her mother after catching her once again in the act.</p>    <p>Milch-Sheriff said she saw Alma\u2019s dead children, who haunt her on stage during the production, as both an enduring trauma she never overcame and a metaphor for her stillborn artistic ambitions, which she is seen on stage literally burying even as she skips her own babies\u2019 funerals.</p> <p>Gustav Mahler, 19 years her senior and already the head of the Vienna Court Opera, wooed the talented young Alma but then gave her a fateful ultimatum when she tried to pursue her own composing in his shadow.</p>    <p>\u201cOf course, she is attracted to him and to his position and to his mind \u2013 maybe not so much to his body, but that\u2019s another story. And he is, of course, attracted to her,\u201d Milch-Sheriff said, speaking by video call from her flat in Tel Aviv.</p> <p>\u201cBut he made a demand of her to give up her music. So this decision which she made, it changed her life. And for me, it was the beginning and the end of her life.\u201d</p> <p>Milch-Sheriff, who is known in Israel and the German-speaking world for works including The Banality of Love, about the affair between the philosopher Hannah Arendt and her mentor Martin Heidegger, said she had her own experiences of being nearly eclipsed by her husband, the composer Noam Sheriff who died in 2018.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, as a female composer of the 21st century, being married to a 20 years older composer and conductor who was famous in Israel and outside Israel \u2013 I was 28, he was 48 \u2013 I know this feeling of being paralysed by this great character and personality,\u201d she said. \u201cBut luckily enough my husband never demanded for me to give up my music.\u201d</p> <p>Alma, by contrast, \u201cfelt as if she murdered her own children like Medea,\u201d she said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t do it by her own hands, but by giving up her soul. She murdered her ability to love, and to care for her children.\u201d</p> <p>While painting an empathetic portrait, Milch-Sheriff does not elide Alma\u2019s virulent anti-Jewish sentiments despite her love for Mahler and Werfel, both Jews.</p> <p>\u201cThese times in Vienna, it was like eating wiener schnitzel to be antisemitic,\u201d said Milch-Sheriff, the daughter of two Holocaust survivors. \u201cIt was the general custom in Vienna so she was no different in that respect.\u201d</p> <p>She noted, however, that Alma had also been instrumental in helping Werfel to escape Nazi-occupied Europe, years after both had expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler, and helped his efforts to \u201crevive German culture\u201d.</p> <p>Annette Dasch, the soprano who plays Alma from middle age back to the first blush of womanhood, said grappling with such hateful dialogue in the libretto by the Israeli author Ido Ricklin was tough.</p> <p>\u201cThere are sentences like \u2018the Jews poisoned my life\u2019 \u2013 especially for me as a German, I had real difficulty saying them, and it\u2019s only because it was written by an Israeli that I can do it. But every time, if I\u2019m honest, it takes a lot out of me.\u201d</p>    <p>Milch-Sheriff credits her fellow Israeli, Omer Meir Wellber, the opera\u2019s conductor and a longtime collaborator, with ensuring that the show could premiere in Vienna, where she said it belonged.</p> <p>Dasch and the Vienna-based director Ruth Brauer-Kvam said the current success of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/alternative-fur-deutschland-afd\">extremist forces in Germany</a> and Austria, where during rehearsals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/29/far-right-freedom-party-winning-austrian-election-first-results-show\">the far-right FP\u00d6 came first in a national election</a>, formed a troubling backdrop to the show.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re now in the 20s again and of course you cannot compare the two [decades] but there are parallels in the sense that everything is kind of falling apart with the wars and other conflicts and people are feeling extremely insecure,\u201d Brauer-Kvam said. Alma\u2019s era was \u201cthe most exciting, but also the scariest times\u201d.</p> <p>For Milch-Sheriff, who calls herself a peace activist and a political opponent of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, it was the \u201ccrumbling\u201d of Israeli society that shaped her writing about early 20th-century Europe.</p> <p>During the 7 October 2023 attacks in Israel, \u201cI was in the middle of composing the opera and I couldn\u2019t work for two months, not even hear the sound of music. Everything seemed to me so meaningless.\u201d</p> <p>Now, \u201cthere is a huge split between half or maybe<strong> </strong>more than half of the Israelis who went extreme right and the liberals, so to say, the centre and left. I don\u2019t know if it will ever be solved.\u201d</p>    <p>All three women said they were clear-eyed about Alma\u2019s many faults but also felt protective of her and her prodigious talents, noting the role her prolific libido played in generating suspicion against her to this day.</p> <p>\u201cPeople still think that when a woman lives out her sexuality to the fullest that they have to insult her or place her in some box while it\u2019s been accepted for many great male artists for centuries,\u201d Dasch said.</p> <p>\u201cI can already imagine that the relatively explicit sex scenes in this opera will be a scandal and then I think: look, they\u2019ve been putting on Don Giovanni for [nearly] 300 years and no one is getting hot under the collar.\u201d</p> <p>Milch-Sheriff said that she hoped by moving backwards in time she could help the audience identify the points of no return in Alma\u2019s bold, broken life.</p> <p>\u201cWill the audience at the end of the opera love her or hate her? My answer is I don\u2019t mind as long as they have more perspective and understanding towards her,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why she still interests so many people around the world, because it\u2019s not something that you can say yes or no to. It\u2019s a question mark and it will remain so.\u201d</p>",

She waved off concerns that the show would bring even more tourists to the already heaving city. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for Rome.\u201d</p> <p>Originally from Calabria, Catalano was eager to see how the show\u2019s saccharine gaze would be applied to the Eternal City. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in Rome for 12 years, but every time I watch a movie set in Rome it seems like a completely different city.\u201d</p> <p>In the<em> quartiere</em> of Esquilino, about a mile or so away from the throngs of tourists, the show\u2019s foray into Rome was also being embraced, even as it was seen as another extension of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/aug/10/emily-in-paris-season-four-netflix\">shameless fantasy</a> that the series has long peddled.</p> <p>\u201cWhat they showed wasn\u2019t the real Rome,\u201d said Christiana Cavallo, a hairdresser. \u201cThey made Rome too clean, there were no crowds. Paris was more real.\u201d</p> <p>The show has long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/aug/10/emily-in-paris-season-four-netflix\">come under criticism</a> for depicting Paris as a city with little litter or construction work and few homeless people.</p>    <p>Cavallo said the series\u2019 stint in Rome had dominated chatter at her hair salon. \u201cThere\u2019s no traffic. And when the Italian couple is fighting in the restaurant and swearing at each other, it\u2019s exaggerated. It was a bit vulgar.\u201d</p> <p>Still, she was elated that it was Rome\u2019s turn to shine. \u201cEmily is Emily, I love it,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Her comments hinted at the wide-ranging impact of the show, despite it being panned by critics. This week, the series set off a diplomatic spat after the French president, Emmanuel Macron, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/09/emmanuel-macron-we-will-fight-hard-to-keep-emily-in-paris-in-france\">vowed</a> to \u201cfight hard\u201d to keep the show in Paris.</p> <p>Rome\u2019s mayor, Roberto Gualtieri, swiftly shot back. \u201cDear Emmanuel Macron, don\u2019t worry. Emily is doing very great in Rome,\u201d he <a href=\"https://x.com/gualtierieurope/status/1844071000113283290\">wrote on social media,</a> adding: \u201cBesides, the heart wants what it wants: let\u2019s let her choose.\u201d</p> <p>Macron\u2019s decision to wade into the lighthearted matter was likely to have been driven by hard data: since the show started streaming in 2020, it has been credited with increasing trade and lighting up the phones of estate agents in Paris. It has also attracted legions of tourists, with one study <a href=\"https://www.leparisien.fr/paris-75/quand-la-serie-emily-in-paris-incite-les-touristes-a-visiter-la-capitale-13-09-2024-F75HLTEUGRFG3D2RMV5Z4ZLSJU.php\">finding</a> that 38% of tourists cited the show among their reasons for visiting the city.</p>    <p>Back in Rome, Angelika Molina, 75, seeking respite from the heaving crowds at the Fontana di Trevi, was not sure if the city was ready to take in more tourists. \u201cIt would be madness, I don\u2019t know if Rome could handle it,\u201d said the Argentine tourist. \u201cTo me, it already seems like there are too many people here.\u201d</p> <p>The city\u2019s turn in the series comes as Rome prepares for the 2025 jubilee, a year-long Roman Catholic event that is expected to draw more than 30 million tourists and pilgrims.</p> <p>For Molina, however, the series\u2019s move meant a coming together of two of her passions: Emily in Paris and Rome. She had excitedly watched the scenes in Rome before landing in the city with her granddaughter for her fourth visit. \u201cIt was magnificent,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m already looking forward to the next season.\u201d</p> <p>Others expressed concern over how the series, long blasted for its stereotype-heavy portrayal of French culture, would typecast Rome and Italian culture. \u201cCan\u2019t they stay in Paris?\u201d asked Anastasia, 27, from London. \u201cLeave Rome alone.\u201d</p> <p>The little she had seen of the show had laid bare a missed opportunity to delve into the reality of immigrating and integrating into a new culture, Anastasia said. \u201c[Emily] doesn\u2019t really appreciate or learn the culture, she\u2019s not actively learning the language, she\u2019s not immersing herself,\u201d she said. \u201cI know it\u2019s escapism \u2026 But I\u2019m just like, look, don\u2019t let her ruin Rome.\u201d</p>    <p>What Emily in Paris \u2013 now Rome \u2013 was serving up was a \u201cbit cliche\u201d, admitted Amalia Rosa, 21, a fan of the show, as crowds pushed past her at the Fontana di Trevi.</p> <p>A case in point was the show\u2019s visit to the same monument, showing scenes with just a few dozen people and plenty of space for everyone. \u201cThat was improbable, there would never be so few people around here,\u201d said the engineering student.</p> <p>\u201cBut what they\u2019re showing was La Bella Roma,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s the Rome that everyone would like to see.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Standing in the shadow of Rome\u2019s most-famous monument, Gabriela Sirtoli, a tourist from Brazil, admitted that the Italian capital was not quite living up to her expectations. She had arrived one day earlier with her partner and their mothers, in part lured by the beguiling scenes of the city she had spotted in the series Emily in Paris. \u201cWhen Emily started in Paris, I went to Paris,\u201d said the 35-year-old as scores of people milled around her, all searching for the perfect snap of the Colosseum. \u201cNow that it\u2019s in Rome, we\u2019re here.\u201d Earlier this month the chirpy series, centred on an American who moves to Paris for work, hinted at a change of scenery as it eschewed sweeping shots of the Eiffel Tower and Montmartre\u2019s Sacr\u00e9-Coeur basilica for a Vespa tour that whizzed past Roman sights such as the Fontana di Trevi to the Colosseum. The show\u2019s creator later confirmed plans to have the fifth season of the series play out between Paris and Rome, building on the surprise cameos the Eternal City had made in the tail-end of the fourth season. In a handful of episodes, it had showed a Rome with little traffic, scant crowds and plenty of space for tourists to contemplate monuments whose history stretch back millennia. Sirtoli\u2019s first day as a tourist in Rome, however, had proved to be very different, as she and her family fought their way through hordes of tourists and spent hours waiting in queues. Still, she was hopeful that the show \u2013 and the magical glimpse it had offered of Rome \u2013 would pull through. \u201cWe came to the Colosseum today and we\u2019re starting to like the city much more,\u201d she said. In Rome\u2019s city centre, many were excited about the change. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to watch it,\u201d said Antonella Catalano, a designer, as she stood in the entryway of her small shop near the Spanish Steps. She waved off concerns that the show would bring even more tourists to the already heaving city. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for Rome.\u201d Originally from Calabria, Catalano was eager to see how the show\u2019s saccharine gaze would be applied to the Eternal City. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in Rome for 12 years, but every time I watch a movie set in Rome it seems like a completely different city.\u201d In the quartiere of Esquilino, about a mile or so away from the throngs of tourists, the show\u2019s foray into Rome was also being embraced, even as it was seen as another extension of the shameless fantasy that the series has long peddled. \u201cWhat they showed wasn\u2019t the real Rome,\u201d said Christiana Cavallo, a hairdresser. \u201cThey made Rome too clean, there were no crowds. Paris was more real.\u201d The show has long come under criticism for depicting Paris as a city with little litter or construction work and few homeless people. Cavallo said the series\u2019 stint in Rome had dominated chatter at her hair salon. \u201cThere\u2019s no traffic. And when the Italian couple is fighting in the restaurant and swearing at each other, it\u2019s exaggerated. It was a bit vulgar.\u201d Still, she was elated that it was Rome\u2019s turn to shine. \u201cEmily is Emily, I love it,\u201d she said. Her comments hinted at the wide-ranging impact of the show, despite it being panned by critics. This week, the series set off a diplomatic spat after the French president, Emmanuel Macron, vowed to \u201cfight hard\u201d to keep the show in Paris. Rome\u2019s mayor, Roberto Gualtieri, swiftly shot back. \u201cDear Emmanuel Macron, don\u2019t worry. Emily is doing very great in Rome,\u201d he wrote on social media, adding: \u201cBesides, the heart wants what it wants: let\u2019s let her choose.\u201d Macron\u2019s decision to wade into the lighthearted matter was likely to have been driven by hard data: since the show started streaming in 2020, it has been credited with increasing trade and lighting up the phones of estate agents in Paris. It has also attracted legions of tourists, with one study finding that 38% of tourists cited the show among their reasons for visiting the city. Back in Rome, Angelika Molina, 75, seeking respite from the heaving crowds at the Fontana di Trevi, was not sure if the city was ready to take in more tourists. \u201cIt would be madness, I don\u2019t know if Rome could handle it,\u201d said the Argentine tourist. \u201cTo me, it already seems like there are too many people here.\u201d The city\u2019s turn in the series comes as Rome prepares for the 2025 jubilee, a year-long Roman Catholic event that is expected to draw more than 30 million tourists and pilgrims. For Molina, however, the series\u2019s move meant a coming together of two of her passions: Emily in Paris and Rome. She had excitedly watched the scenes in Rome before landing in the city with her granddaughter for her fourth visit. \u201cIt was magnificent,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m already looking forward to the next season.\u201d Others expressed concern over how the series, long blasted for its stereotype-heavy portrayal of French culture, would typecast Rome and Italian culture. \u201cCan\u2019t they stay in Paris?\u201d asked Anastasia, 27, from London. \u201cLeave Rome alone.\u201d The little she had seen of the show had laid bare a missed opportunity to delve into the reality of immigrating and integrating into a new culture, Anastasia said. \u201c[Emily] doesn\u2019t really appreciate or learn the culture, she\u2019s not actively learning the language, she\u2019s not immersing herself,\u201d she said. \u201cI know it\u2019s escapism \u2026 But I\u2019m just like, look, don\u2019t let her ruin Rome.\u201d What Emily in Paris \u2013 now Rome \u2013 was serving up was a \u201cbit cliche\u201d, admitted Amalia Rosa, 21, a fan of the show, as crowds pushed past her at the Fontana di Trevi. A case in point was the show\u2019s visit to the same monument, showing scenes with just a few dozen people and plenty of space for everyone. \u201cThat was improbable, there would never be so few people around here,\u201d said the engineering student. \u201cBut what they\u2019re showing was La Bella Roma,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s the Rome that everyone would like to see.\u201d",

Cries of ecstasy float over a soundtrack of Robert Palmer\u2019s Addicted to Love as the plane hits supersonic and the flight attendant pops the champagne. It can only be Jilly Cooper, and that bottom can only be Rupert Campbell-Black \u2013 champion show jumper, international heart-throb, Tory sports minister, braying toff, absolute shit. Lock up your telly remote, because Rivals \u2013 that most gloriously 1980s piece of doorstopper fiction, Blighty\u2019s answer to Tom Wolfe\u2019s Bonfire of the Vanities \u2013 has landed on our screens.</p> <p>Full disclosure. I am a Jilly Cooper super fan. Dame Jilly is my heroine, and Rivals would be my Desert Island Discs book of choice. I took my daughter\u2019s name, Pearl, from one of her books. So ardent is my love for Jilly that I applied to be an extra on this TV adaptation of Rivals. (Sadly it didn\u2019t work out.) In fact, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/19/jilly-cooper-jump-latest-book\">I have written about Jilly before</a>. When that article \u2013 more of a love letter, if I\u2019m honest \u2013 was published, she sent me a handwritten, two-page thank-you note, addressed to \u201cDarling, darling Jess\u201d which is preserved as a treasure in my scrapbook, along with my wedding photos and my children\u2019s first drawings. I am not making this up.</p> <p>Cooper\u2019s novels have bottoms on the covers (Riders, an absolute peach in white jodhpurs) and exclamation marks in their titles (Jump!) and she is therefore belittled as a writer. Which is a travesty, because her emotional intelligence is second to none. There is no one better on the worlds that exist within a marriage. No one sharper on the dynamics of a dinner party. Much of what I know about life, I learned from Jilly. She is generous and wise, wrapping morality tales in a buttery pastry of sex and puns and parties. And she is hilarious, the queen of the delicious takedown. No one \u2013 perhaps Jane Austen, on a good day \u2013 understands better the very English art of getting away with being rude about people by being funny about it. I am not, by the way, the only person who thinks all this. In 2017 Cooper was the subject of a 3,700-word appreciation in the London Review of Books by Cambridge academic Dr Ian Patterson, in which he compared her world-building skills as a novelist to Charles Dickens, Anthony Trollope and Zadie Smith.</p> <p>What everyone does know about Jilly Cooper is the sex. \u201cAs he slid inside her, she felt all the amazed joy of a canal lock suddenly finding it can accommodate the QE2\u201d is not a line Dickens would have come up with. And now that Rivals is on TV, there is sex everywhere: at the office, on top of pianos, on piles of coats at parties. Cooper adores sex, and having crushes, and gossiping about sex, and having people fancy you. She reminds me of another blond heroine of mine, Donatella Versace, in her red-lipsticked feminine lust for the erotic. (Cooper was one of the first popular novelists to make casual mention of vibrators.) When it was published, Rivals was infamous for how bountiful the sex was, but watching it on screen in 2024 you notice how fun \u2013 how wholesome, even \u2013 it is. Everyone is just having a lovely time, lots of orgasms, none of the choking and hair-pulling of aggressive internet pornography. Early in the first episode, we see Rupert\u2019s bottom, again, because he is playing tennis naked, which feels more Famous Five than Fifty Shades of Grey. It was a simpler time, when a grooming routine meant lying in the sun until you were conker brown, \u201ctrimming your bush\u201d with nail scissors (a world innocent of the Brazilian wax!) and splashing on the Fracas or Cal\u00e8che fragrance your lover brought you from duty free.</p>    <p>Buck\u2019s fizz and shepherd\u2019s pie. Wham! and Paul Simon. Long boozy lunches and smoking indoors. The trill of a landline, the thwack of a Filofax. Lady in Red as the big end-of-night tune. Rivals is a time capsule which this mini-series captures to perfection. And for all the money-shots of honey-coloured Cotswold stone mansions (plenty of those, don\u2019t worry) its world of 20th-century wealth is brash and flash in a way which, in a post-Succession age, feels almost quaint. The calibration of wealth was of a different order before the hyperscaling of the last three decades. In Rivals\u2019 Rutshire, rich men show off their wealth with cigars, not private jets; expense accounts, not offshore ones.</p> <p>There is no question that Rivals is deeply problematic. For a start, there is a general assumption that domineering, rude men are the hottest kind of men. Cooper did not invent this trope \u2013 hello, Mr Darcy \u2013 but still, one does flinch a little when Campbell-Black, played by Alex Hassell, says to his beloved, \u201cDarling, you know I love you to bits, but never tell me what to do.\u201d Sexism is simply accepted as a fact of life. Campbell\u2019s idea of a compliment is to say admiringly, \u201cWith looks like hers, I wouldn\u2019t have thought a career was that important.\u201d But \u2013 aside from Rupert C-B, who gets a free pass because he is just so divine looking, darling \u2013 Cooper is ruthless in her skewering of the male ego as a wrecking ball, as destructive to home life as it is in a boardroom. David Tennant is deliciously watchable as Lord Baddingham, all huge but fragile ego.</p> <p>And then there is the casual racism, present in the book and on screen. A modicum of diversity has been added to the cast for Rivals\u2019 television outing, but only barely, and the wall-to-wall whiteness of many scenes feels jarring. For the most part, the moral hemline has been let down by an inch or two in the journey to screen \u2013 just enough to head off outrage. The age differential between Taggie (20) and Rupert (nearly twice that) is skated over, helped by Sex Education\u2019s Bella Maclean playing Taggie as a little less wet than she is in the original. </p> <p>In the book, political correctness is a punchline. Guardian readers are grumpy oddballs. For a modern television audience, the dial has been nudged a notch or two in the progressive direction. The central storyline in the novel is about competition between \u2026 television franchises, I think? It really wasn\u2019t the point, and the details escape me. Anyway, the machinations of terrestrial television don\u2019t scream white-hot centre of power these days, so the 2024 version focuses on the prospect of powerful people being brought down by what they say on television, which has a certain relevance in the age of Prince Andrew on Newsnight and Joe Biden\u2019s presidential debate.</p>    <p>There is a scene in another Cooper book when a woman is described as being \u201cso blonde and beautiful, with such wonderful brown breasts after a week in Portugal, that no one minded her breastfeeding at all\u201d. At times, like here, the mores of this world seem pure comedy. I mean, you might as well try to cancel Blackadder. But not all of it feels harmless. I wish that when I had first read this book as a teenage girl, I had understood that giving their weight in stone and pounds \u2013 with seven and a half stone being the ideal \u2013 was a weird way to describe women. The stark body shaming has gone, for television, but the mood music remains. At a buffet, we will be given a closeup of what a character puts on their plate, seemingly in an invitation to judge them on it. Only now this treatment is meted out, equal opportunities style, to men as well as women.</p> <p>The nuance of Jilly Cooper is that the joke is not always on who it appears to be. Take the rampant snobbery. Being called Sharon or Trevor is hilarious in Rivals. So are regional accents. And \u2013 well, adultery is one thing, but saying lounge instead of sitting room! Beyond the pale. Oh, and imagine the shame of having a crescent-shaped flower bed with red and yellow flowers in it, instead of honeysuckle and roses and a walled garden! Can you even? Cooper knows this world and all its labyrinthine unwritten rules. Dogs, for instance, must be black labradors or scruffy mongrels, and never, under any circumstances, anything smaller than a cocker spaniel. Yet \u2013 no spoilers \u2013 snobs get their comeuppance in the end, in Jilly\u2019s world.</p> <p>Is the Rivals worldview sexist and racist and classist? Yes. Were those good things? No. But was that world Jilly\u2019s fault? No, it was the fault of patriarchy and global systems of inequality. Don\u2019t try to lay it on my Jilly, just for telling it like it is. Is Rivals good TV? Listen, I\u2019m clearly the wrong person to ask, what with the whole hero-worship thing. I can tell you that the fashion is a riot: especially Cameron Cook, played by Nafessa Williams, who looks as if she\u2019s wearing Yves Saint Laurent when everyone else is in Dorothy Perkins. And don\u2019t get me started on the amazing hair. Or the moustaches. Oh, and the party scenes are a joy. I defy you to watch Patrick\u2019s 21st and not think, wow, We Don\u2019t Have to Take Our Clothes Off is a <em>banger</em>. Man, I wish I could have been an extra in that scene. The heart wants what it wants. Jilly simply adores Rupert Campbell-Black, despite his many faults. And I feel the same way about Jilly.</p> <ul> <li><p>Rivals is on Disney+ from 18 October</p></li> </ul>",

No. But was that world Jilly\u2019s fault? No, it was the fault of patriarchy and global systems of inequality. Don\u2019t try to lay it on my Jilly, just for telling it like it is. Is Rivals good TV? Listen, I\u2019m clearly the wrong person to ask, what with the whole hero-worship thing. I can tell you that the fashion is a riot: especially Cameron Cook, played by Nafessa Williams, who looks as if she\u2019s wearing Yves Saint Laurent when everyone else is in Dorothy Perkins. And don\u2019t get me started on the amazing hair. Or the moustaches. Oh, and the party scenes are a joy. I defy you to watch Patrick\u2019s 21st and not think, wow, We Don\u2019t Have to Take Our Clothes Off is a banger. Man, I wish I could have been an extra in that scene. The heart wants what it wants. Jilly simply adores Rupert Campbell-Black, despite his many faults. And I feel the same way about Jilly. Rivals is on Disney+ from 18 October",

      "body": "<p>A group of women are gathered around a stunning watercolour, arguing about all the erections it contains. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing you wouldn\u2019t see on ancient Greek pottery,\u201d says one. \u201cI think it symbolises freedom,\u201d ventures another. But Harriet Loffler has reservations. She loves the piece we\u2019re viewing here at Frieze art fair in London: a painting by Chinese artist Shafei Xia featuring a girl boxer, a white tiger with painted red nails, and, yes, a merry procession of breasts and penises erupting from clothes. But is it right for her gallery?</p> <p>Loffler curates The Women\u2019s Art Collection, at Murray Edwards college in Cambridge. Although the public can visit the collection for free, the building is primarily a place where female students live and work. There are religious sensitivities to think about, not to mention the potential for distraction that could occur. \u201cI\u2019d worry that some students would just find it funny rather than think critically about it,\u201d says WAC assistant curator Laura Moseley.</p> <p>When you\u2019re tasked with buying an artwork for a prestigious institution \u2013 with around 600 works on display, the WAC has the largest number of works by women in Europe \u2013 there is a lot to consider. How will a new piece work with the college\u2019s sightlines? Can it start a dialogue with existing artworks? Does it fulfil the gallery\u2019s mission statement: \u201cto champion artists who identify as women, to give them visibility and a voice, and promote gender equality\u201d?</p>    <p>There\u2019s another consideration: who is going to pay for it? Loffler has no budget for acquisitions and is therefore reliant on good will. Step forward <a href=\"https://www.spiritnowlondon.com/\">Spirit Now London</a>, a philanthropic art community headed by the magnificently named Marie-Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre. For the last three years, a small group of her female members have chipped in to a \u00a340,000 acquisition fund. They then nominate a gallery to spend this at Frieze, on the proviso that the cash goes to a female artist under 40.</p> <p>In 2022, thanks to Spirit Now London, a Sylvia Snowden work became part of the collection at The Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, and last year a large-scale installation by Bronwyn Katz was acquired for the Hepworth Wakefield. Today, 17 members of the Spirit Now London acquisition team are at Frieze\u2019s opening morning. They are granted an hour\u2019s early access and the plan is to leg it around the fair viewing all of the artworks on their shortlist before the crowds arrive. Each member will then vote for their favourite works in a secret ballot and Loffler will make her decision from the most popular choices.</p> <p>An hour is not long to locate and view a dozen pieces, but Loffler is a force of nature. Armed with a map and a Biro-penned route, she expertly directs her troops from gallery to gallery, where salespeople deliver short speeches about each artwork. Within about 15 minutes, we have seen photographs of Bangladeshi TV sets, Persian rug-inspired works that wrestle with gender identity and an ice-white sculpture that dangles in the air so invitingly that one member has to be dragged away from trying to fondle it. There\u2019s little time to contemplate, or even grab a coffee. \u201cDoes anybody need the toilet?\u201d asks Loffler, striding onward as if she\u2019s in an episode of The West Wing. \u201cNo? OK, let\u2019s head to C9!\u201d</p> <p>My head is bursting with all this new art and info. But this purchase is more considered than it looks. Galleries submitted viable artworks to Spirit Now London in advance and Loffler and Moseley whittled them down from 54 to 25 artists. Then, during a meeting at de Clermont-Tonnerre\u2019s house a few days before Frieze, a shortlist of 12 was created. What if they see something on the day not on the shortlist? Can Loffler buy something wildly on impulse? \u201cNo, no,\u201d she insists. \u201cIt has to be much more structured than that.\u201d</p>    <p>Not every buyer at Frieze is as restricted. When I speak to Gregor Muir, Tate\u2019s director of international art collection, he is enthusiastic about the \u201cfluid and frenetic\u201d buying process at Frieze, where each year they get to spend \u00a3150,000 through a fund provided by a group called Endeavor.</p> <p>In 2021, Tate had no idea they would end up acquiring <a href=\"https://www.biennial.com/project/ru-kox-kobel-jun-ojer-etemabel-the-echo-of-an-ancient-form-of-knowledge/\">Edgar Calel\u2019s The Echo of an Ancient Form of Knowledge (or </a><em><a href=\"https://www.biennial.com/project/ru-kox-kobel-jun-ojer-etemabel-the-echo-of-an-ancient-form-of-knowledge/\">Ru k\u2019 ox k\u2019ob\u2019el jun ojer etemab\u2019el</a></em><a href=\"https://www.biennial.com/project/ru-kox-kobel-jun-ojer-etemabel-the-echo-of-an-ancient-form-of-knowledge/\">)</a>. It hadn\u2019t been on their shortlist because it hadn\u2019t been made yet. On the morning of the fair, the Maya-Kaqchikel artist sourced local rocks and arranged fruit and vegetables from a local market on top of them. It wasn\u2019t even technically on sale. Tate and the artist came to an agreement based on Mayan custom, in which the museum has custodianship of the work for 13 years (a number representing the major joints in the body).</p> <p>Brokering custodian agreements based on Mayan custom isn\u2019t the norm at these things, but what about good old-fashioned haggling? Is that the done thing here? \u201cWe have to ask for discounts as a museum,\u201d says Muir. \u201cWe have to evidence that we secured a work at the best price for the nation. But obviously we don\u2019t want to stray into areas where it causes discomfort for the artist. You don\u2019t want to give someone an unpleasant experience.\u201d A soft touch is important. If Tate are keen on an artwork, but haven\u2019t made the final decision yet \u2013 something that must be run past director Maria Balshaw \u2013 they quietly let the gallery know of their interest to ensure nothing gets away.</p>    <p>Back at this year\u2019s Frieze, Loffler is becoming apprehensive. She\u2019s seen six or seven artworks now but says: \u201cI\u2019m still waiting for that eureka moment.\u201d Paloma Proudfoot\u2019s arresting Skin Poem catches her eye \u2013 but she has doubts about how the various segments of glazed ceramic could be fixed to the college building. \u201cThey do screw directly into a wall,\u201d says the gallery\u2019s salesperson. \u201cYes, but we\u2019re a Grade II-listed building,\u201d says Loffler. \u201cWe can only drill into mortar.\u201d I get the sense that nothing gets past this curator.</p> <p>Such is Loffler\u2019s determination to find an artwork that speaks to her collection she even goes off-piste and asks the group to consider something not on the shortlist \u2013 a startling tapestry that deals with AI and female freedom. Their stringent rules get tested on more than one occasion \u2013 one gallery even offers up a piece of work that resides in South Africa rather than Frieze itself.</p> <p>It\u2019s not until we reach Bambou Gili\u2019s painting Legally Stev that the tension lifts. Loffler doesn\u2019t need to tell me this is her eureka moment \u2013 I hear her gasps. In dazzling blues and greens, Gili\u2019s painting of her friend reclining on a bed speaks to the solitude of student life but also the solidarity of female friendship. The fact she\u2019s staring at a mobile phone gives it a modern spin.</p> <p>From here, things start to fall into place. Everyone is stunned by Asemahle Ntlonti\u2019s layering of paint, paper and thread in a work called Uhambo that \u201ctells the story of South Africa\u201d. And after Loffler decides that Xia\u2019s erection-heavy piece isn\u2019t suitable for college walls, the artist\u2019s gallery goes into a frenzy to show some less erotic works hiding out in a back room. White gloves are swiftly donned as a variety of paintings and ceramics are unveiled on the floor.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like Christmas morning at Frieze,\u201d exclaims one Spirit Now London member. Indeed, in the excitement, one woman from the group snaps up a small watercolour for her own private collection. Another treats herself to a delightful ceramic tiger on a ball. Luckily for Loffler, the work she likes the most remains: a topless woman cradling a tiger and holding a candlestick.</p> <p>With all the artworks viewed, I head off to meet the Tate team and see how their Frieze splurge went. In a tiny room behind a door just next to Gili\u2019s painting, their outfit (including two guest curators) are beavering away on laptops, finalising the acquisition of numerous works. The team worked last night to go over every item to make sure \u201cno stone was left unturned\u201d. Then they all met today at 8.30am for a series of heated discussions regarding which ones to buy: two paintings, including the charming The Spaghetti House, from self-taught British-Bengali painter Mohammed Z Rahman; a 17-panel piece comprised of natural pigment on tree bark by Naminapu Maymuru-White, a senior Yol\u014bu artist of North East Arnhem Land, in the Northern Territory of Australia; a 1969 work by the Czech surrealist Eva \u0160vankmajerov\u00e1 that creates an interesting dialogue with the works Tate already have; and a series of three pastels by Bani Abidi, a Pakistani artist based in Berlin who depicted conversations around Gaza with various activist friends.</p>    <p>This year, Tate seem to have adhered to the shortlist. In contrast, by the time Spirit Now London head to their fancy lunch at Ham Yard to vote, the whole thing seems completely up in the air.</p> <p>Loffler gives a speech outlining the reasons why she\u2019d love to acquire Gili, Ntlonti or Xia\u2019s work. But from here it\u2019s out of her hands. I know that several members fell hard for Han Bing\u2019s dreamlike evocations of Paris, an artwork Loffler thought \u201clooked stunning\u201d but wouldn\u2019t be right for her collection. As everyone starts writing down their two favourite artists on slips of paper, I whisper to her: \u201cWhat happens if they all go for something you don\u2019t really want?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not actually sure,\u201d she says, looking a little nervous for the first time today.</p> <p>She needn\u2019t have worried. The women of Spirit Now London have voted for artists in line with Loffler\u2019s speech. And the good news is that the \u00a340,000 budget means Loffler can afford to buy work from all three of them without even having to haggle. I check my phone: we\u2019ve covered 10,000 steps at Frieze alone. But perhaps most impressive is the way this warm community of art lovers have put aside their own egos and personal preferences to select the pieces they know will work best for the WAC.</p> <p>I do still have a question, though. After discounting Shafei\u2019s epic watercolour on the grounds of it being too pornographic, Loffler ended up buying the picture of the tiger-cradling woman grasping a candlestick. It hasn\u2019t escaped my attention that the candle in question looks rather like, well, you can guess. Loffler smiles and shrugs, looking totally relaxed about it. Sometimes even the most stringent rules are made to be broken. </p>",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI\u2019d been in an absolute battle, and the adrenaline was still pumping,\u201d Frazer Clarke says as he remembers the harrowing aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/68693947\">his fight against Fabio Wardley</a> in March. Their British and Commonwealth heavyweight title bout was a ferocious and gripping contest that ended in a draw and the rematch will take place in Riyadh on Saturday night. Clarke had been knocked down heavily in the fifth round but the canvas was splattered mostly with the blood of Wardley, who also went through hell.</p> <p>Before he considers the prospect of returning to a dark place in the ring with Wardley, Clarke talks in riveting detail about the consequences of that first bout at London\u2019s 0<sub>2</sub> Arena. \u201cMy girlfriend, Danni, had gone to bed because she was emotionally drained. She was in bits. So I went up to her and this is what people don\u2019t see. I\u2019m in our room and I\u2019m really hot, really overheating. I\u2019m getting as much water down as I can but my missus says: \u2018You need to get some sleep.\u2019 I say: \u2018I\u2019m scared.\u2019 She asks why and I say: \u2018I don\u2019t want to close my eyes because I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to open them again.\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/26/la-2028-olympics-target-gennady-golovkin-named-chair-of-world-boxing-commission\">World Boxing name Gennady Golovkin as chair in bid to fill void left by IBA</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clarke and I are sitting in a different hotel room in Westminster. It\u2019s bare, anonymous and hushed while the 33-year-old boxer talks in an unbroken monologue. \u201cIt might sound like an exaggeration but my ears were ringing, my heart was racing, I was still sweating. I\u2019m sitting in darkness and the room felt like a sauna. I could feel the blood trickling out of my ear.</p> <p>\u201cDanni was worried. She was like: \u2018Should we call someone?\u2019 We probably should have done, but I said: \u2018No, let me just drink some water and I\u2019ll take some time before I lie down.\u2019 I did that and, eventually, fell asleep. Thankfully, I woke up in the morning. But in those moments I felt bad and afraid.\u201d</p> <p>How was he on the morning after the fight? \u201cSore all over,\u201d he says ruefully. \u201cIt was even harder knowing I had to go down to breakfast to see my family and everyone. I had loads of praise from everyone who saw me but it still didn\u2019t take away that heartache.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to have breakfast with the British title over my lap \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t there. People don\u2019t understand my life and the sacrifices I make, the time I can\u2019t spend with my loved ones, my kids who I missed taking their first steps or saying their first words because I was away at a training camp. People never understand how hard it is to be a boxer.\u201d</p>    <p>I show Clarke a photograph of the canvas after his fight with Wardley. It looks like a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/apr/24/how-jackson-pollock-spattered-his-way-to-fame\">Jackson Pollock painting</a> where blood rather than paint has been sprayed and splashed across the canvas. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that photo,\u201d he says, \u201cand it definitely tells a story and shows the reality of our sport.</p> <p>\u201cI love boxing but it\u2019s dangerous and I have a beautiful family who come first. That photograph is a little reminder that you don\u2019t want it to be your blood. But I\u2019m human and I wouldn\u2019t want to do any lasting damage to anyone.\u201d</p> <p>Wardley admitted that such fights can take years off a boxer\u2019s career. \u201cIn some cases, definitely,\u201d Clarke agrees. \u201cYou want an exciting fight but you don\u2019t ever want one like that.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke then grins helplessly. \u201cBut we\u2019re fighters and so, in a strange way, I enjoyed it. Then when you look back you think: \u2018Bloody hell!\u2019 A lot of people ask: \u2018How do you do it?\u2019 The honest answer is I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>When the draw was announced, Clarke looked more disappointed than Wardley. \u201cI knew it was close but a draw was devastating. Still, Fabio and I had a few words full of respect in the changing room. I thanked him because he brought the best out of me.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a really emotional night but there was a beautiful moment when I walked into the bar at the Intercontinental, at the O<sub>2</sub>, to a standing ovation from 300 people. Everyone wanted to buy me a drink. People were singing my name. Fabio walks in two minutes later to silence. That spoke volumes.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s hard to keep them from watching but I don\u2019t want the women in my life to see me suffer </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Does a part of him dread returning to such dangerous territory in the ring? \u201cI don\u2019t mind going back there. I just don\u2019t want my kids to see it. I don\u2019t want my mum or my nan to see it. It\u2019s hard to keep them from watching but I don\u2019t want the women in my life to see me suffer.\u201d</p> <p>When the two fighters were reunited for a press conference in London last month, Clarke said he was looking forward to \u201csmashing him in the face\u201d. It seems very different now when hearing him discuss his interaction with Wardley. \u201cThis is a professional rivalry,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a rivalry where we\u2019re going to insult each other\u2019s families or each other\u2019s looks.</p> <p>\u201cThis is just a case that \u201cI want to be better than you in our sport.\u201d That\u2019s the kind of boxing rivalry I love. I think about him, and what I\u2019m going to do, every now and then. Like any other boxer, if I walk past the mirror or a window, I throw a few punches at my reflection, as if it\u2019s him, because I\u2019m programmed to do it.</p>    <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not normal people. We punch holes in each other to try and get the best out of each other, to try and improve each other. But, when you fight, you\u2019re trying to destroy the person in front of you in that moment. This is my job and I take it very seriously.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was a young amateur I\u2019d think boxing was about life or death. But now I\u2019ve got kids \u2013 a boy of three and girl of seven \u2013 I don\u2019t want it to be life or death. If I win, amazing; if I lose I\u2019ve given it my best but I hope I\u2019m healthy.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke has skirted death outside the ring. In December 2016, while celebrating the birth of his daughter in his home town of Burton, he was stabbed three times. \u201cI went out, wetting the baby\u2019s head, and that was a bad decision. I had a few drinks, like everyone else did, as it was near Christmas. I got into an altercation which I thought was a normal bit of fisticuffs. I ended up being stabbed once in the neck and twice in the leg.</p> <p>\u201cIn the hospital my mum and dad, all my friends, were holding me down because I was intoxicated. I was angry, but I needed a blood transfusion so had to behave. I\u2019ve recently seen one of the nurses from that night. She said: \u2018You don\u2019t remember me but I was trying to help you when you were stabbed.\u2019 It all came back to me, her face above me in her scrubs. So there have been some crazy moments but that was a great life lesson and I\u2019m here to tell my story.\u201d</p> <p>Three months later, in March 2017, Clarke attended a boxing press conference at the House of Commons. Soon after leaving he witnessed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/23/mps-honour-the-memory-of-pc-keith-palmer\">the murder of PC Keith Palmer </a>during the Westminster Bridge terror attack. \u201cI walked outside to see an individual come round a corner with two Rambo-style knives and he was stabbing a police officer, Keith Palmer. Stabbing him to death 15 metres away from me. I could see it as clear as day. The police officer got free and ran towards us. He fell towards me and one of my coaches, Tony Davis, tried to resuscitate him. But, tragically, it was too late.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/08/weve-got-nothing-to-lose-ruthless-ainslie-ready-to-take-on-all-blacks-of-sailing\">\u2018We\u2019ve got nothing to lose\u2019: ruthless Ainslie ready to take on All Blacks of sailing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThen we got locked in the building while the police dealt with the attack on the bridge.

In order for me to feel satisfied, I have to risk my life.\u201d</p> <p>Does his girlfriend want him to get out of boxing, especially after that last savage fight against Wardley? \u201cNo, not yet. She knows, while I am unfulfilled, it would be the worst thing for me to stop boxing. I set myself goals and, until I\u2019ve given everything to try to achieve them, I won\u2019t be stopping. So, if I have to, I\u2019ll go back to the darkest places again.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>In 1978, when I was nine years old, I unexpectedly moved to India with my free-spirited mother, who had recently become a disciple of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/07/cult-oregon-1980s-terror-netflix-documentary-wild-country\">Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (later known as Osho)</a>. Like others of her generation, she was swept up in the allure of Rajneesh\u2019s promises: enlightenment, freedom and belonging. Osho denounced traditional religion, offering a new path to self-liberation through cathartic meditations and therapy groups, communal living and free love. In the west, they called Osho the \u201csex guru\u201d.</p> <p>Shortly after our arrival at Rajneesh\u2019s ashram, I was initiated into the community and the guru gave me a new name: Ma Prem Sarito. I felt as if I now belonged, and being in the ashram was an exhilarating adventure, a portal to a world where normal boundaries dissolved. School became a distant memory. The lush gardens and nooks and crannies of the ashram were transformed into a playground where my friends and I roamed freely, liberated from structure and rules. My mother, like many other parents, embraced Rajneesh\u2019s philosophy that children belonged not to their biological parents but to the collective. Before long, I moved into the ashram and rarely interacted with my mother.</p> <p>Though I was loved by many sannyasins (Rajneesh\u2019s devotees) and some looked out for me, there was no formal structure to ensure my emotional or physical wellbeing. Over time, the facade of love and celebration began to crack, revealing darker undercurrents that quietly enveloped me. It began innocently enough \u2013 a guard teaching my friends and me how to french kiss. But soon I began to sense the inappropriate attention of certain men.</p> <p>One day, a man coaxed me and another girl into giving him a hand job. We were both only 10 years old. Though I tried to convince myself it was just a game, a reflection of the open sexuality around us, it felt grossly wrong. Deep down, I knew that unless I remained vigilant, situations like this would continue to occur.</p> <p>These darker undercurrents entangled me more fully when, in 1981, the commune moved to the US. I was among the first to arrive at the ranch the commune had bought in central Oregon. It was during those early days that I was lured into what I thought was a love affair with a much older man. I was only 12 years old; he was 29. However, what I believed to be love was no such thing.</p> <p>At the time I suffered silently as he repeatedly drew me in with affection and took me to bed only to ignore me for days as I watched him pursue adult women and, in time, my peers. At the same time, other men circled, and eventually I gave in, as sleeping around and being \u201cliberated\u201d was the norm that was modelled to me. As time passed, I felt increasingly worthless and angst ridden, and took my bad feelings to mean I was flawed. We were to be positive, not negative, so I didn\u2019t speak of my pain and confusion.</p> <p>When the commune collapsed in 1985, we were all flung back into the world unprepared. I was 16, disoriented, broke and unsure of who I was. The trauma of my upbringing haunted me, but I couldn\u2019t yet name it. As the years passed, I came to see it for what it was and came to see how Osho\u2019s teachings tilled the soil for abuse \u2013 under the guise of spiritual freedom to boot. It sickened me. I distanced myself from the movement, from the teachings, and forged a life of my own.</p> <p>Then in 2018 Netflix released <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/24/wild-wild-country-netflix-cult-sex-noa-maxwell-bhagwan-shree-rajneesh-commune-childhood\">Wild Wild Country</a>, a docuseries about the community at the Rajneeshpuram complex. Watching it stirred my heartache and my fury. The series brought Rajneesh back into the public eye \u2013 but it only scratched the surface, focusing on the political and criminal scandals in Oregon. What about us children?</p>    <p>I gathered my courage and shared about my abuse in a Rajneesh Facebook group. At that time I was too scared to name my perpetrators. I found some support on the group, but many of the responses were the same old things I\u2019d heard before, such as: \u201cThe kids seemed so mature\u201d, or, \u201cIt\u2019s not like all the kids were abused \u2013 it\u2019s just how you choose to see it.\u201d I left that discussion feeling enraged and determined to break my silence outside the insular Rajneesh community. I reached out to several peers I knew had also experienced abuse, hoping they would join me in speaking out.</p> <p>They all initially declined, but three years later, in 2021, I received an unexpected call from one of them telling me she was finally ready. We began to share our stories, igniting a reckoning in which many other commune youth, and even adults, came forward and shared their own stories of abuse. Each new revelation was heart-wrenching. One of my peers from Rajneeshpuram said she had slept with 70 men, another said 150. This was before either of them had turned 16.</p> <p>Children from the Rajneesh communes in Europe also spoke up. This is how I came to know Maroesja Perizonius, director of the documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/02/children-of-the-cult-review-osho-commune-bhagwan-shree-rajneesh-wild-wild-country\">Children of the Cult</a>. In her post, Maroesja recounted her own abuse in the Rajneesh commune in Amsterdam. For her, it began at the age of 13. Maroesja and I connected and quickly realised we shared the same determination to expose the systemic abuse that had been suppressed for too long. We each embarked on our creative paths: I began writing my memoir, and she set out to make a film that unveils the pervasive abuse carried out in the name of love and light. Though it has taken me decades to find my voice, I stand here today proud to join Maroesja and others to ensure that our stories are finally heard.</p> <ul> <li><p>Sarito Carroll is featured in the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/02/children-of-the-cult-review-osho-commune-bhagwan-shree-rajneesh-wild-wild-country\">Children of the Cult</a> which screens Sunday 13 October <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/presscentre/epweekweek-42-2024-sat-12-oct-fri-18-oct/children-cult\">on ITV and ITVX at 10.15pm</a>.

In the west, they called Osho the \u201csex guru\u201d. Shortly after our arrival at Rajneesh\u2019s ashram, I was initiated into the community and the guru gave me a new name: Ma Prem Sarito. I felt as if I now belonged, and being in the ashram was an exhilarating adventure, a portal to a world where normal boundaries dissolved. School became a distant memory. The lush gardens and nooks and crannies of the ashram were transformed into a playground where my friends and I roamed freely, liberated from structure and rules. My mother, like many other parents, embraced Rajneesh\u2019s philosophy that children belonged not to their biological parents but to the collective. Before long, I moved into the ashram and rarely interacted with my mother. Though I was loved by many sannyasins (Rajneesh\u2019s devotees) and some looked out for me, there was no formal structure to ensure my emotional or physical wellbeing. Over time, the facade of love and celebration began to crack, revealing darker undercurrents that quietly enveloped me. It began innocently enough \u2013 a guard teaching my friends and me how to french kiss. But soon I began to sense the inappropriate attention of certain men. One day, a man coaxed me and another girl into giving him a hand job. We were both only 10 years old. Though I tried to convince myself it was just a game, a reflection of the open sexuality around us, it felt grossly wrong. Deep down, I knew that unless I remained vigilant, situations like this would continue to occur. These darker undercurrents entangled me more fully when, in 1981, the commune moved to the US. I was among the first to arrive at the ranch the commune had bought in central Oregon. It was during those early days that I was lured into what I thought was a love affair with a much older man. I was only 12 years old; he was 29. However, what I believed to be love was no such thing. At the time I suffered silently as he repeatedly drew me in with affection and took me to bed only to ignore me for days as I watched him pursue adult women and, in time, my peers. At the same time, other men circled, and eventually I gave in, as sleeping around and being \u201cliberated\u201d was the norm that was modelled to me. As time passed, I felt increasingly worthless and angst ridden, and took my bad feelings to mean I was flawed. We were to be positive, not negative, so I didn\u2019t speak of my pain and confusion. When the commune collapsed in 1985, we were all flung back into the world unprepared. I was 16, disoriented, broke and unsure of who I was. The trauma of my upbringing haunted me, but I couldn\u2019t yet name it. As the years passed, I came to see it for what it was and came to see how Osho\u2019s teachings tilled the soil for abuse \u2013 under the guise of spiritual freedom to boot. It sickened me. I distanced myself from the movement, from the teachings, and forged a life of my own. Then in 2018 Netflix released Wild Wild Country, a docuseries about the community at the Rajneeshpuram complex. Watching it stirred my heartache and my fury. The series brought Rajneesh back into the public eye \u2013 but it only scratched the surface, focusing on the political and criminal scandals in Oregon. What about us children? I gathered my courage and shared about my abuse in a Rajneesh Facebook group. At that time I was too scared to name my perpetrators. I found some support on the group, but many of the responses were the same old things I\u2019d heard before, such as: \u201cThe kids seemed so mature\u201d, or, \u201cIt\u2019s not like all the kids were abused \u2013 it\u2019s just how you choose to see it.\u201d I left that discussion feeling enraged and determined to break my silence outside the insular Rajneesh community. I reached out to several peers I knew had also experienced abuse, hoping they would join me in speaking out. They all initially declined, but three years later, in 2021, I received an unexpected call from one of them telling me she was finally ready. We began to share our stories, igniting a reckoning in which many other commune youth, and even adults, came forward and shared their own stories of abuse. Each new revelation was heart-wrenching. One of my peers from Rajneeshpuram said she had slept with 70 men, another said 150. This was before either of them had turned 16. Children from the Rajneesh communes in Europe also spoke up. This is how I came to know Maroesja Perizonius, director of the documentary Children of the Cult. In her post, Maroesja recounted her own abuse in the Rajneesh commune in Amsterdam. For her, it began at the age of 13. Maroesja and I connected and quickly realised we shared the same determination to expose the systemic abuse that had been suppressed for too long. We each embarked on our creative paths: I began writing my memoir, and she set out to make a film that unveils the pervasive abuse carried out in the name of love and light. Though it has taken me decades to find my voice, I stand here today proud to join Maroesja and others to ensure that our stories are finally heard.

      "body": "<p>They say everyone remembers their first Wimbledon, but mine was so far back that it\u2019s a bit of a blur. <a href=\"https://www.eadt.co.uk/sport/21426607.wimbledon-veteran-wendy-murrays-comeback-first-day-nerves-strawberries-cream/\">It was 1982</a>, the year that Jimmy Connors beat John McEnroe, and I had tickets to Centre Court. But what made it special for me was the opening week: it was my first Wimbledon as a line judge, and since then I\u2019ve officiated there in all but two of the tournaments. So when I heard on Wednesday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/09/tennis-wimbledon-abolishes-line-judges-after-147-years-electronic-line-calling\">the tournament is replacing us</a> line judges with electronic line calling, I was gutted. It hurt even more because I only found out when it was announced in the news and my phone started pinging with people asking me how I felt.</p> <p>I used to play a lot of tennis when I was younger, and when you play junior tournaments you end up umpiring each other\u2019s games. It was at a tournament at Wembley, sponsored by Benson &amp; Hedges, where I saw an advert from the Professional Tennis Umpires Federation (PTUF) calling for new members, and I thought I\u2019d give it a go. I had about 30 minutes\u2019 training at the Queen\u2019s Club in west London and I was in. The PTUF was run by ex-military types then and they were very particular about how you stood, sat and walked on to court. They wouldn\u2019t put up with any slouching.</p> <p>Until recently we were only paid expenses for travelling to and officiating at games, so line judges did our jobs purely for the love of tennis. You\u2019d work your way up through the different local events and get graded by the chair umpire until eventually you were considered good enough for Wimbledon \u2013 the dream. A few colleagues have told me this week that they\u2019re not going to bother renewing their licences now that they can\u2019t aim towards officiating at Wimbledon any more, so I worry that smaller tournaments will struggle to find line judges soon.</p>    <p>I imagine the All England Club has made this decision because the players want the consistency of computerised decisions \u2013 though several of them didn\u2019t like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/apr/24/tennis\">Hawk-Eye</a> at all when it came in. But there\u2019s so much that a human line judge does that a computer just can\u2019t offer. We certainly keep up tennis\u2019s traditions \u2013 I think we make the court look fully dressed. And spectators can learn a lot about the game when they can see the discussions between a line judge and the chair umpire. All of that will be lost.</p> <p>I\u2019m not saying we never make mistakes \u2013 we\u2019re human, after all. But we hold ourselves to a very high standard. You have to be utterly impartial \u2013 even when Andy Murray is about to win his first Wimbledon and you\u2019re willing him to succeed, and nobody wants to be the one to have to call his match point shot out. (We were lucky that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/07/andy-murray-wimbledon-2013-novak-djokovic\">Novak Djokovic hit the ball into the net</a> so we didn\u2019t have to.) Or the year that Andre Agassi was playing Pat Rafter and I was under the royal box on the centre line. Agassi swore, and I had to go and report it to the chair, which I suddenly realised was a long way to walk with the whole crowd watching me.</p> <p>It\u2019s sad to think that I won\u2019t have a moment like that again. I won\u2019t get to stand on Centre Court. And I wish they could have told us before this year\u2019s tournament so that we\u2019d have a chance to say goodbye. I\u2019ll always love tennis, but I don\u2019t think I could bear to go to Wimbledon now as a spectator. It just wouldn\u2019t have the same atmosphere.</p> <p><em>As told to Katy Guest</em></p> <ul> <li><p>Wendy Smith has been a tennis line judge since 1979.

      "bodyText": "They say everyone remembers their first Wimbledon, but mine was so far back that it\u2019s a bit of a blur. It was 1982, the year that Jimmy Connors beat John McEnroe, and I had tickets to Centre Court. But what made it special for me was the opening week: it was my first Wimbledon as a line judge, and since then I\u2019ve officiated there in all but two of the tournaments. So when I heard on Wednesday that the tournament is replacing us line judges with electronic line calling, I was gutted. It hurt even more because I only found out when it was announced in the news and my phone started pinging with people asking me how I felt. I used to play a lot of tennis when I was younger, and when you play junior tournaments you end up umpiring each other\u2019s games. It was at a tournament at Wembley, sponsored by Benson &amp; Hedges, where I saw an advert from the Professional Tennis Umpires Federation (PTUF) calling for new members, and I thought I\u2019d give it a go. I had about 30 minutes\u2019 training at the Queen\u2019s Club in west London and I was in. The PTUF was run by ex-military types then and they were very particular about how you stood, sat and walked on to court. They wouldn\u2019t put up with any slouching. Until recently we were only paid expenses for travelling to and officiating at games, so line judges did our jobs purely for the love of tennis. You\u2019d work your way up through the different local events and get graded by the chair umpire until eventually you were considered good enough for Wimbledon \u2013 the dream. A few colleagues have told me this week that they\u2019re not going to bother renewing their licences now that they can\u2019t aim towards officiating at Wimbledon any more, so I worry that smaller tournaments will struggle to find line judges soon. I imagine the All England Club has made this decision because the players want the consistency of computerised decisions \u2013 though several of them didn\u2019t like Hawk-Eye at all when it came in. But there\u2019s so much that a human line judge does that a computer just can\u2019t offer. We certainly keep up tennis\u2019s traditions \u2013 I think we make the court look fully dressed. And spectators can learn a lot about the game when they can see the discussions between a line judge and the chair umpire. All of that will be lost. I\u2019m not saying we never make mistakes \u2013 we\u2019re human, after all. But we hold ourselves to a very high standard. You have to be utterly impartial \u2013 even when Andy Murray is about to win his first Wimbledon and you\u2019re willing him to succeed, and nobody wants to be the one to have to call his match point shot out. (We were lucky that Novak Djokovic hit the ball into the net so we didn\u2019t have to.) Or the year that Andre Agassi was playing Pat Rafter and I was under the royal box on the centre line. Agassi swore, and I had to go and report it to the chair, which I suddenly realised was a long way to walk with the whole crowd watching me. It\u2019s sad to think that I won\u2019t have a moment like that again. I won\u2019t get to stand on Centre Court. And I wish they could have told us before this year\u2019s tournament so that we\u2019d have a chance to say goodbye. I\u2019ll always love tennis, but I don\u2019t think I could bear to go to Wimbledon now as a spectator. It just wouldn\u2019t have the same atmosphere.

Coordinators helped run three Telegram channels with more than 70,000 subscribers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/20/neo-nazi-terrorist-group-steve-bannon-account\">an ISD study found in August</a>, purporting to be news feeds, one of which claimed to be associated with Steve Bannon\u2019s War Room podcast.</p> <p>The channels are not overtly linked to Terrorgram, but all three pushed readers or subscribers from around the world to join related group chats where, <a href=\"https://www.isdglobal.org/digital_dispatches/beyond-the-collective-understanding-terrorgrams-efforts-to-infiltrate-the-mainstream-on-telegram/\">the ISD said</a>, \u201ccontent supporting mass violence and societal collapse is rife\u201d \u2013 with investigators considering children potentially more susceptible to violent influence.</p> <p>Some of the online radicalisation is considered by investigators to be a hangover from the Covid period, when youngsters and families were forced to spend more time online. But it has also led to a blurring of ideas and motivations, making it hard at times for investigators to see what, if any, ideology is involved.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/08/mi5-chief-uk-facing-growing-threat-from-islamic-state-russia-and-iran\">MI5 chief: UK facing growing threat from Islamic State, Russia and Iran</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re also seeing the mainstreaming of ideas such as extreme misogyny online, or school shooter fandoms,\u201d said Rose. \u201cSome of this is aestheticised online with graphics or fast music, presented as a computer game \u2013 and one result is that people without an ideology become motivated to carry out acts of extreme harm.\u201d</p> <p>Reflecting online culture, Terrorgram is largely a loose association of shared content. Though two of its alleged leaders, both American, were charged in September with 15 counts of hate crimes, soliciting the murder of federal officials and conspiring to support terrorists by US authorities, it is expected to evolve and endure.</p> <p>Child terror cases are largely related to extreme rightwing networks, but there has been a resurgence in Islamist activity.

      "bodyText": "Teenagers as young as 13 are coming under suspicion of engaging in terrorism after being exposed to a toxic cocktail of easily accessible far-right extremism online, experts have warned. Insiders describe \u201ca horrible hateful soup\u201d of social media content where children can \u201cpick and mix\u201d terrorist narratives, including the Terrorgram network \u2013 recently banned in the UK \u2013 of white supremacist channels on Telegram. Experts have tracked 49 children convicted of terror offences since 2016 \u2013 all but one of whom are boys \u2013 and this week Ken McCallum, the head of MI5, said \u201c13% of all those being investigated by MI5 for involvement in UK terrorism are under 18\u201d, a threefold increase in three years. But the increasing proportion of children under scrutiny also poses problems, with questions arising over whether teenagers should be criminalised \u2013 and MI5 and experts acknowledge cases often raise issues of mental health or grooming. Hannah Rose, an analyst with the Institute of Strategic Dialogue (ISD) thinktank, said there had been a \u201csurge in online extremist ecosystems\u201d for several years, which remain \u201cvery easy for children to access\u201d, and that \u201coffline vulnerabilities, which kids are more likely to have, can make somebody more prone to adopting extremist views\u201d. In April Britain proscribed Terrorgram, a loose online neo-fascist group. Coordinators helped run three Telegram channels with more than 70,000 subscribers, an ISD study found in August, purporting to be news feeds, one of which claimed to be associated with Steve Bannon\u2019s War Room podcast. The channels are not overtly linked to Terrorgram, but all three pushed readers or subscribers from around the world to join related group chats where, the ISD said, \u201ccontent supporting mass violence and societal collapse is rife\u201d \u2013 with investigators considering children potentially more susceptible to violent influence. Some of the online radicalisation is considered by investigators to be a hangover from the Covid period, when youngsters and families were forced to spend more time online. But it has also led to a blurring of ideas and motivations, making it hard at times for investigators to see what, if any, ideology is involved. \u201cWe\u2019re also seeing the mainstreaming of ideas such as extreme misogyny online, or school shooter fandoms,\u201d said Rose. \u201cSome of this is aestheticised online with graphics or fast music, presented as a computer game \u2013 and one result is that people without an ideology become motivated to carry out acts of extreme harm.\u201d Reflecting online culture, Terrorgram is largely a loose association of shared content. Though two of its alleged leaders, both American, were charged in September with 15 counts of hate crimes, soliciting the murder of federal officials and conspiring to support terrorists by US authorities, it is expected to evolve and endure. Child terror cases are largely related to extreme rightwing networks, but there has been a resurgence in Islamist activity. Last month a 15-year-old from Nottingham received three-year community behaviour and youth referral orders for sharing violent videos relating to Islamic State and pledging allegiance to the terror group on Telegram. MI5 has previously found itself investigating a 13-year-old from Cornwall, who became leader of the UK arm of the banned neo-Nazi Feuerkrieg Division, an online group that was itself set up in 2018 by another 13-year-old from Estonia. The British boy was sentenced to a two-year non-custodial rehabilitation order in 2021, while one of his recruits, 17-year-old Paul Dunleavy, was jailed in November 2020 for five and a half years for helping prepare acts of terrorism. Though Dunleavy\u2019s terror efforts were described as \u201cinept\u201d, he advised other members how to use firearms, some of whom were convicted of terror offences abroad. Adam Hadley, the executive director of Tech Against Terrorism, which aims to disrupt extremist groups online, said there had been \u201csignificant job cuts\u201d at social media companies, particularly in \u201ctrust and safety content moderation\u201d, which has helped extremist content escape being censored. Specialists say extremist material is most prevalent on X, which has cut content monitoring since its takeover by Elon Musk, and on Telegram. Last month its boss, Pavel Durov, announced he would seek to improve moderation on the network after he was arrested in France amid an investigation into its use for sharing child sexual abuse images and drug trafficking. Questions have also been raised about whether terror prosecutions are an appropriate way to deal with cases of childhood radicalisation.

But don\u2019t be put off, it has never been easier to start your own collection.</p> <p>Next week, 20,000 visitors will descend on <a href=\"https://affordableartfair.com/\">the Affordable Art Fair</a> (AAF) in London\u2019s Battersea Park and over the four days will browse and buy thousands of contemporary paintings, sculptures, photographs and prints. It\u2019s one of a number of similar events around the UK; the autumn months are a busy time in the art calendar.</p> <p>At the fair, seasoned pros rub shoulders with first-time and \u201ctomorrow\u2019s\u201d buyers, says Will Ramsay, founder of the event. Ramsay started the fair to \u201cmake it easier for people to buy art\u201d. As the event celebrates its 25th year, he declares: \u201cWe have done that.\u201d</p> <p>The average spend at the fair is about \u00a3800, with prices starting at about \u00a350 for an editioned work with a ceiling at \u00a37,500. (An edition is a series of identical prints or other work. It is up to the artist how many pieces are in the series; they are usually numbered and sometimes signed, which can add to their value and collectability.)</p> <p>An art work such as an etching which is one of 25, will cost less than a unique painting. \u201cFor an edition, we\u2019re probably talking \u00a350 to \u00a3500,\u201d says Ramsay. \u201cFor a unique piece, it might be \u00a3200 to \u00a37,500.\u201d</p>    <h2><strong>Finding out what\u2019s good</strong></h2> <p>Just like buying anything for your home, you need to do your homework. With art, it\u2019s not just about setting a budget, you need to wrestle with \u201chow do I know what is good?\u201d And \u201cam I paying the right price?\u201d</p> <p>Some people find choosing pictures a daunting prospect but buying art should be pleasurable, says <a href=\"https://www.henrymillerfineart.co.uk/\">Henry Miller</a>, an east London-based art dealer and gallery owner.</p> <p>\u201cPeople worry about buying the wrong thing or paying too much,\u201d or whether it will \u201cmatch the sofa\u201d, but Miller says \u201ctry to put all of that out of your mind.\u201d He adds: \u201cIf you can afford it and you love it, that should be enough.\u201d</p> <p>If you are still at the stage of figuring out which style or medium you like best, experts suggest joining a non-profit art institution as a way to gain exposure to lots of work. In London, for example, a Royal Academy membership starts at \u00a3138 a year or \u00a367 for 16- to 35-year-olds. Most places have several pricing tiers and, generally speaking, the more you pay the greater the access to artists, curators and gallerists.</p>    <p>Another simple option is to use <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/article/art-sales-how-to-start-your-own-art-collection\">social media</a> to follow artists, contemporary commercial galleries and art fairs for alerts on upcoming events in the arts calendar and to join mailing lists.</p> <p>\u201cInstagram is becoming an increasingly important forum for artists, galleries and collectors, with a growing number of buyers purchasing works found through the platform,\u201d says Katherine Oliver, consultant and ex-curator at the Royal Academy.</p> <p>Browsing online galleries \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/\">Artsy is the biggest </a>\u2013 lets you compare artists, styles and prices.</p> <p>Also keep an eye on graduates from the major art schools such as the Royal College of Art, Slade School of Fine Art, and Central Saint Martins. \u201cGo to graduate shows, meet artists and talk to them about their work,\u201d says Oliver. \u201cIn two or three years they could be represented by a commercial gallery and their pieces may rocket in value.\u201d</p> <p>Research art online, then look at what is showing locally, or get involved with the local art scene, says Lizzie Glendinning, co-founder and curator of <a href=\"https://woolwichprintfair.com/\">Woolwich Contemporary Print Fair </a>which bills itself as \u201cdisrupting the elitist nature of art fairs, and pushing the boundaries of print\u201d. Glendinning adds that it really depends on why you\u2019re buying and what you are interested in: \u201cI like dark and moody, so I need to see that in real life.\u201d</p>    <p>Fairs can provide inspiration, Glendinning says. Woolwich, which is a mix of specialist galleries and artists selected by industry experts, is expected to attract 15,000 visitors from 21-24 November. \u201cNo one is expecting anyone to drop \u00a330,000,\u201d she says, although some people do \u2013 one of the galleries made a \u00a360,000 sale last year.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThis year we\u2019ve got some works for under \u00a3100 but then we also have celebrated names for \u00a325,000. We\u2019ve got entry points for all types of collectors.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <h2>Spreading the cost</h2> <p>At the moment a <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/artanddesign/2024/oct/07/outside-friezes-big-tent-the-london-art-world-faces-severe-headwinds\">lack of megasales</a> means that the top end of London\u2019s art world is feeling a chill. People are still willing to spend five- and six-figure sums at the bigger fairs, but one analyst said that when the price topped \u00a31m \u201cthey were just a little bit more cautious\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAt the high and middle end in a less booming economy the art market suffers,\u201d says Ramsay. \u201cHowever, at the Affordable Art Fair level, over the 25 years we\u2019ve seen fairly little difference in the overall art sold. That is because we gain some people who might have bought more expensive work and sadly lose some off the bottom, for whom it is too tight.\u201d</p>    <p>If there\u2019s a piece that you\u2019ve fallen in love with but it\u2019s too expensive, then don\u2019t be afraid to ask if you can pay in instalments. If it\u2019s a \u201cno\u201d then ask if the artist has smaller works or whether it is possible to commission a piece from them that better fits your budget.</p> <p>Another option is to look out for editions produced by major artists to help raise funds for non-profit making organisations such as the Royal Academy.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.alliededitions.org/\">Allied Editions</a> is a \u201cunique artist editions collective\u201d of seven London venues \u2013 including the Camden Arts Centre and the Whitechapel Gallery \u2013 with prices starting at \u00a3100. It has a stand at this weekend\u2019s high-end art fair Frieze London selling limited editions from a roster of famous names including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Chetwynd\">Monster Chetwynd</a>, <a href=\"https://judychicago.com/\">Judy Chicago</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/lubaina-himid\">Lubaina Himid</a>, <a href=\"https://www.victoria-miro.com/artists/19-chantal-joffe/\">Chantal Joffe</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Kruger\">Barbara Kruger</a>, <a href=\"https://helenmarten.net/\">Helen Marten </a>and <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/yoko-ono\">Yoko Ono</a>.</p> <p>It is also possible to spread the cost thanks to the <a href=\"http://ownart.org.uk/\">Own Art</a> initiative which offers interest-free loans of up to \u00a325,000 to make it \u201ceasier and more affordable for people to buy and enjoy original art and craft, regardless of their income and socioeconomic background\u201d.</p>    <p>With a network of nearly 300 galleries across England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, <a href=\"https://www.ownart.org.uk/\">Own Art</a> has facilitated \u00a375m worth of sales of contemporary art and craft to more than 83,000 people over the past 20 years.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m up to my eyes in Own Art payments,\u201d jokes Glendinning, who says the scheme has been a gamechanger. \u201cWhen we introduced it for the [Woolwich Contemporary Print Fair] we got at least a third more sales. Instead of paying \u00a3400 for a print upfront, you can pay \u00a340 a month; and that\u2019s less than a night out.\u201d</p> <p>While it is human nature to hope you\u2019ve picked up something by the next Banksy, Ramsay stresses that it is very important that people \u201clove what they\u2019re buying\u201d.</p>    <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got to want to live with it,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they discover in 20 years\u2019 time the art has gone up in value then they can feel smug about their excellent taste. Some go up. Many don\u2019t. Investment shouldn\u2019t be the primary aim.\u201d</p> <p>London-based art dealer Miller says would-be buyers should opt for quality over quantity. Buy \u201cone or two works a year for as much as you can afford\u201d, he says. \u201cIf you do this, in a few years you\u2019ll have an outstanding collection.\u201d</p> <p>Occasionally you\u2019ll make mistakes, he adds, but don\u2019t worry. \u201cLearn from it. You can always sell the mistake and buy something else.\u201d</p>",

We\u2019ve got entry points for all types of collectors.\u201d Spreading the cost At the moment a lack of megasales means that the top end of London\u2019s art world is feeling a chill. People are still willing to spend five- and six-figure sums at the bigger fairs, but one analyst said that when the price topped \u00a31m \u201cthey were just a little bit more cautious\u201d. \u201cAt the high and middle end in a less booming economy the art market suffers,\u201d says Ramsay. \u201cHowever, at the Affordable Art Fair level, over the 25 years we\u2019ve seen fairly little difference in the overall art sold. That is because we gain some people who might have bought more expensive work and sadly lose some off the bottom, for whom it is too tight.\u201d If there\u2019s a piece that you\u2019ve fallen in love with but it\u2019s too expensive, then don\u2019t be afraid to ask if you can pay in instalments. If it\u2019s a \u201cno\u201d then ask if the artist has smaller works or whether it is possible to commission a piece from them that better fits your budget. Another option is to look out for editions produced by major artists to help raise funds for non-profit making organisations such as the Royal Academy. Allied Editions is a \u201cunique artist editions collective\u201d of seven London venues \u2013 including the Camden Arts Centre and the Whitechapel Gallery \u2013 with prices starting at \u00a3100. It has a stand at this weekend\u2019s high-end art fair Frieze London selling limited editions from a roster of famous names including Monster Chetwynd, Judy Chicago, Lubaina Himid, Chantal Joffe, Barbara Kruger, Helen Marten and Yoko Ono. It is also possible to spread the cost thanks to the Own Art initiative which offers interest-free loans of up to \u00a325,000 to make it \u201ceasier and more affordable for people to buy and enjoy original art and craft, regardless of their income and socioeconomic background\u201d. With a network of nearly 300 galleries across England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, Own Art has facilitated \u00a375m worth of sales of contemporary art and craft to more than 83,000 people over the past 20 years. \u201cI\u2019m up to my eyes in Own Art payments,\u201d jokes Glendinning, who says the scheme has been a gamechanger. \u201cWhen we introduced it for the [Woolwich Contemporary Print Fair] we got at least a third more sales. Instead of paying \u00a3400 for a print upfront, you can pay \u00a340 a month; and that\u2019s less than a night out.\u201d While it is human nature to hope you\u2019ve picked up something by the next Banksy, Ramsay stresses that it is very important that people \u201clove what they\u2019re buying\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to want to live with it,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they discover in 20 years\u2019 time the art has gone up in value then they can feel smug about their excellent taste. Some go up. Many don\u2019t. Investment shouldn\u2019t be the primary aim.\u201d London-based art dealer Miller says would-be buyers should opt for quality over quantity. Buy \u201cone or two works a year for as much as you can afford\u201d, he says. \u201cIf you do this, in a few years you\u2019ll have an outstanding collection.\u201d Occasionally you\u2019ll make mistakes, he adds, but don\u2019t worry. \u201cLearn from it. You can always sell the mistake and buy something else.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t even pissed,\u201d Hanif Kureishi says, as if somehow that would have made it better. The writer is talking about the accident that left him a tetraplegic. Or, as he likes to call himself with classic Kureishian brutality, a vegetable. Though he\u2019s not. His body may be broken, but his brain isn\u2019t.</p> <p>It was Boxing Day 2022 and he was in Italy. Back then the writer spent half his idyllic life in Rome, half in London. His three sons were adult and independent, he had enough money to enjoy a good life, he was in love with his wife, Isabella d\u2019Amico, and, at the age of 68, the enfant terrible of English literature was content in a way he\u2019d never been. He was having a beer, watching the football on his iPad, when he had a dizzy spell. He stood up, took a few steps forwards and fainted. He later discovered he had fallen on his head and broken his neck. Kureishi was left paralysed.</p> <p>Would it have made any difference if he had been pissed? \u201cI could have reproached myself more. You seek some kind of explanation; some kind of finality. Why has it happened to me?\u201d At the London Spinal Cord Injury Centre, where he was transferred after spending a year in Italian and English hospitals, he was surrounded by people asking themselves the same question. Virtually all had suffered horrific fluke injuries resulting in broken necks. \u201cSome twat had fallen out of bed and broken his neck. Some other twat had fallen down the stairs and broken his neck.\u201d Twat, in Kureishi\u2019s lexicon, is not an insult \u2013 just a synonym for person. \u201cA nice guy tripped over a rake in his garden and broke his neck. So everybody in there is thinking, what the fuck? One guy, a close friend of mine, a political philosopher and rock climber, fell on his head and was paralysed from the neck down.\u201d Kureishi\u2019s neck break is partial. He still has feeling and movement in his limbs, though he cannot walk or grip with his hands.</p> <p>Kureishi thought his life was over. For starters, he thought he might die. Then, if he did survive, what was the point? He could no longer do anything for himself. The man who had lived a life of belligerent, cussed independence, doing what the hell he wanted when the hell he wanted, was now wholly dependent on others for everything. Almost two years on, he has written a book about the accident and life afterwards. With apt and typical directness, it\u2019s called Shattered. And Kureishi has been in every way.</p> <p>As a writer, he is known for a different kind of shattering \u2013 of taboos. He made his name as the screenwriter of Stephen Frears\u2019s 1985 romcom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/dec/01/how-we-made-my-beautiful-laundrette-stephen-frears-gordon-warnecke-hanif-kureishi-daniel-day-lewis\">My Beautiful Laundrette,</a> though romcom suggests a tweeness at odds with the reality. It featured a gay love affair (a rarity 40 years ago) between a young Anglo-Pakistani man and a white skinhead with a history of racist violence (Daniel Day-Lewis in his breakthrough role). The film was a groundbreaking mix of romance, racism and identity politics. Kureishi was nominated for a best original screenplay Oscar.</p>    <p>His next film, Sammy and Rosie Get Laid, portrayed a British man of Pakistani ancestry and a white woman in an open marriage, against the backdrop of London lit up by riots. Kureishi\u2019s first and best known novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/04/the-buddha-of-suburbia\">The Buddha of Suburbia</a>, is a thinly disguised fictionalisation of his own upbringing that caused huge upset in his family. His 1998 novella Intimacy told the story of a young man leaving his wife and two young sons, with coruscating candour \u2013 Kureishi had just left his wife and two sons. There wasn\u2019t a scab from his private life not worth picking over in his fiction.</p> <p>Kureishi\u2019s subjects were belonging (and not belonging) and transgression. He was calculatedly transgressive. His screenplay for My Son the Fanatic tackled Muslim fundamentalism in 1997, while The Mother is a film about a woman in her mid-60s (played by Anne Reid) initiating an affair with a man in his early 30s (Daniel Craig). Nothing was unsayable or undoable in Kureishi\u2019s work. And it still isn\u2019t.</p> <p>Shattered is exuberantly scatological, soaked in the catheterised piss and enema-extracted shit of his new life. It is also a tribute to those who have helped him through the worst of it; a prolonged screech of injustice; an exploration of dependency in which he portrays himself as half baby, half tyrant; and a defiant fist pump for survival.</p> <p>We meet at the home he shares with d\u2019Amico, an Italian literary publicist, in west London. His 24-hour-a-day care worker Camilla opens the door. Kureishi is waiting for me in the living room. His electric wheelchair is state of the art, with tyres fit for a 4x4. There are any number of prints framed on the walls \u2013 a John Lennon photo here, a Rembrandt self-portrait there, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/ingres\">Ingres </a>nude, family pics, a miniature Alex Ferguson in a tiny glass cup on the mantelpiece (he is an avid Manchester United fan). In the corner is the hospital bed he sleeps on.</p> <p>Kureishi is wearing a sloppy purple jumper and baggy tracksuit bottoms. He used to pride himself on his style, but tells me it\u2019s pointless wearing a smart pair of trousers when you can\u2019t walk. He is warm and curious, wanting to know about life at the Guardian, what else I get up to, which football team I support. He asks if I\u2019d mind sitting on the sofa so he can position his wheelchair to look at me when we chat. Camilla brings him a black coffee with a straw, and a beaker of water.</p>    <p>The house is large, on three storeys, but Kureishi tells me he\u2019s not seen the second and third floors since the accident. He is confined to the living room and kitchen, and it frustrates the hell out of him. Having said that, he\u2019s much more positive than he has been, largely because he\u2019s back working. \u201cMost people with spinal injuries never work again. If you\u2019re a ski instructor or a lorry driver, you\u2019re fucked. I met a lot of people in hospital with spinal injuries. They go home, but what they do at home is just watch the TV \u2013 they can\u2019t work. Their lives are over.\u201d He\u2019s lucky to be a writer, he says \u2013 though he has had to learn a new way of writing that requires huge patience, both for him and those helping.</p> <p>It was only a couple of days after the accident that he started writing again. He was desperate to find out if he could still do it. So he dictated his thoughts to d\u2019Amico. \u201cShe would sit on the end of the bed taking dictation. It was madness. I was shouting at her, yelling, half-dead.\u201d Why was he yelling? \u201cUrgency. I had this very strong desire to say something. To see if I could go back to being a writer. I was bombed out of my head on all kinds of shit, but I wanted to find out whether I was still the same person. We did a blog every day. Then the kids came over to Rome and my son Carlo brought his computer, and we started publishing them on <a href=\"https://hanifkureishi.substack.com/\">Substack</a>.\u201d</p> <p>He talks me through the process. \u201cI\u2019d lie in bed and write the blog in my head, and would see the order of the thoughts. I\u2019d try to memorise the sentences so when Isabella or my boys came [Kureishi has 30-year-old twins Carlo and Sachin with film producer Tracey Scoffield, and Kier, 26, with psychologist Monique Proudlove], I could just dictate it straight to them. I had to learn how to write in this completely new way.\u201d</p> <p>What surprised him, and gave him such hope, was that when they published the blogs on Substack, people wanted to read them. Hundreds, then thousands, then tens of thousands. He realised this was a subject that people wanted to hear about. What\u2019s more, they wanted to hear about it from him. Carlo effectively became his editor. \u201cHe\u2019d tell me I\u2019d missed stuff out, repeated myself. He\u2019d say, \u2018That\u2019s really boring.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>I tell him how much I like the book. \u201cOh good, thank you, mate! All that pain and misery. I don\u2019t know how you enjoy it, but people say they like it.\u201d Perhaps enjoy is not quite the right word. It\u2019s fascinating, painful and very funny against the odds.</p> <p>The coffee has had time to cool. \u201cSimon, could you give me a hit of that coffee, would you mind? Sorry to ask you, mate.\u201d I put the cup to his lips and he sucks from the straw. In the book, he says how angry Sachin gets with him because of his lack of pleases and thank yous. Today, his manners are impeccable.</p>    <p>Kureishi says it was only when he came out of hospital that he realised how different he is now from most people. In hospital, pretty much everybody used a wheelchair. \u201cWhen I finally got out on to the street and went up to Shepherd\u2019s Bush [in west London], everyone was walking about, and you think, what the fuck, how can they walk? There are so many of them and there\u2019s one wheelchair on the street. You have to get used to all that, and I have got used to it now.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s also getting used to the cost of life as a tetraplegic. \u201cI have physio every day, which I pay for myself and is costing me a fucking fortune \u2013 nearly \u00a3100 a day, so money really matters. If I take a taxi into London to have supper and come back here, the taxi will cost me \u00a3200. Who the fuck has got that kind of money?\u201d</p> <p>But he knows that among the unlucky, he\u2019s one of the luckiest. \u201cOne guy rang me up and said, \u2018I want to give you \u00a325,000.\u2019\u201d What did you say to him? \u201c\u2018Fuck me! For fuck\u2019s sake.\u2019 And he said, \u2018No, I\u2019m going to give it you. I know you\u2019ve got terrible expenses, etc\u2019 and he gave me the money.\u201d Was he a close friend? \u201cHe was a friend, but not a close one. It was so moving and upsetting in a way.\u201d Why upsetting? \u201cThat somebody would be so generous to me and see what a pickle I was in and what I needed.\u201d Was it hard to accept? \u201cI felt embarrassed. You don\u2019t want to ask people for money. I <em>didn\u2019t</em> ask him for money. I would never ask for money. So I felt embarrassed, yeah. Suddenly you become a supplicant.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>You lie in bed with beautiful Italian nurses washing you and you can\u2019t feel anything. Your sexuality has gone for ever</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are the friends who come round, bring food, feed him, brush his teeth, give him a head massage and read him a bedtime story. They spend hours with him. He\u2019s humbled by their generosity and it\u2019s made him question what kind of person he was before the accident. \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful that somebody\u2019s doing this for me. Then you think, would I do this for someone else, and I think it wouldn\u2019t occur to me. Most of the people who do all that for me are women, and you think, I wish I could do this for them now. But it\u2019s too late for me to do this now, and I regret I didn\u2019t do it before.\u201d In Shattered, he writes, \u201cI wish I had been kinder. If I get another chance I will be.\u201d But he knows he won\u2019t get the chance to help people in the way they have helped him.</p> <p>The selfishness of his former life is a recurring theme in Shattered. He\u2019s not apologising for his past, just acknowledging it. He calls himself an \u201copportunist social climber\u201d and says he loved hanging out with the older generation of British literary heavyweights \u2013 Salman Rushdie, Martin Amis, Julian Barnes. The mid-80s through to the 90s was a wonderful time for writers \u2013 advances were huge and plentiful. He might have been politically on the left, but he didn\u2019t half benefit from the Thatcherite ethos. \u201cIn the 1980s, selfishness was the character ideal of the age, and fucking hell was it fun.\u201d He makes no bones about being numero uno in his life.</p> <p>There was always a laddishness to Kureishi\u2019s writing; a desire to prod and shock. In Shattered, he writes about his proneness to choking since the accident. \u201cI am more intimate with the Heimlich manoeuvre than cunnilingus.\u201d To even think of comparing the two takes a degree of perversity. He boasts about taking cocaine with his sons. After fantasising about \u201cthe world of filth and depravity\u201d, he is reminded \u201chow close sexuality and disgust have to be for sex to retain its edge\u201d.</p> <p>Shattered is sex obsessed. But this time it\u2019s not sex as a possibility or inevitability, it\u2019s sex as an impossibility. The accident has left him impotent. I tell him he reminds me of Michael Gambon\u2019s Philip Marlow in The Singing Detective, hospitalised, in psoriatic agony, but instead of trying to think of unsexy things to stifle an erection, here he\u2019s conjuring up sexual fantasies to see if he\u2019s capable of getting one. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a very perceptive thing to say. I <em>was</em> lying in bed like Michael Gambon in that show with these beautiful Italian nurses washing you and cleaning you, and you can\u2019t feel anything. Your sexuality has gone for ever. They\u2019re leaning over you, and they smell beautiful, and they\u2019ve got great eyebrows, and all your dreams have come true. You\u2019ve got three nurses tending to you, and there\u2019s <em>nothing</em> you can do about it.\u201d Kureishi is incorrigible. You sense he really does believe that if only he\u2019d been in full working order, the nurses would have jumped into his hospital bed to enable him to fulfil <em>their</em> fantasies.</p>    <p>In Shattered, to see if he can get himself going, he recalls a threesome he had in his promiscuous 40s after he had left his first wife. A younger woman he hooked up with in Amsterdam gets in touch to tell him she\u2019s in Britain. He asks her to visit him. Would you like me to bring anything, she asks. Yes, he says \u2013 chocolate, weed, magic mushrooms and a friend.</p> <p>What strikes me about the passage, I tell Kureishi, is the way you depict yourself as a taker rather than a giver. He smiles. \u201cWell, that night I was obviously looking for an adventure, but I wouldn\u2019t say that was an everyday experience. I wrote about it because I thought it was funny.\u201d It\u2019s also bathetic. \u201cIt was a disappointment,\u201d he admits. \u201cI\u2019d been expecting a threesome with two women and she turned up with her boyfriend who was the same age as me, clinically depressed and barely said anything. He just sat on the end of the bed with his head in his hands watching me fuck his girlfriend.\u201d</p> <p>He launches into a spluttering phlegmy cough. It sounds so uncomfortable for him. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he says when he gets his breath back. \u201cCoughing is really important to clear your lungs, and I\u2019ve got reduced capacity. It\u2019s difficult for me to clear my lungs.\u201d</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Kureishi tells me about Nietzsche\u2019s theory of the eternal recurrence \u2013 the philosophical concept that our lives will repeat infinitely and in each life every detail will be exactly the same. He says he lay in his hospital bed, revisiting the past, asking himself whether he\u2019d want to change it. \u201cYou can\u2019t live a life without thinking how stupid you were and what a mistake that was, and how self-sabotaging that was. I\u2019ve been in therapy for a long time, and my therapist kept me from some of my more self-destructive impulses to do with substances and bad relationships and stupid behaviour. And having kids has also kept me on the straight and narrow.\u201d When he totted up his balance sheet, he concluded the one thing he wouldn\u2019t change at all is his time with d\u2019Amico. \u201cShe\u2019s my destiny; the person I want to be with.\u201d</p> <p>Did he ever think something awful could happen to disturb that contentment? \u201cYes. When I turned the TV off and went into the kitchen to close the windows at night, I used to look out and think, how much longer is this going to go on? There\u2019ll be a day when this happiness will end. I always thought that way.\u201d</p> <p>Shattered is as savage as anything he\u2019s written, but it\u2019s also in large part a love letter to all those who have supported him \u2013 friends; strangers on the street; his sons; d\u2019Amico; Scoffield, who emerges as heroic. \u201cWhen I go out on the street, people come up to me all the time and say, \u2018Well done, mate, I love your writing.\u2019 Nobody approached me before. Now it\u2019s every day. I\u2019ve become a local celebrity because of the blog.\u201d</p>    <p>In a way he wasn\u2019t before? \u201cIt\u2019s the disability. It\u2019s pity. And it\u2019s love. And it\u2019s their generosity. You realise how kind people are. How loving they are.\u201d He seems so astonished by the world\u2019s kindness, I wonder if it\u2019s because he himself used to have an unkind view of the world. Perhaps fans didn\u2019t approach him because he seemed unapproachable \u2013 too cool for school. He doesn\u2019t have time to answer before he is hit by another phlegmy coughing fit. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he says. Time for a drink.</p> <p>Over the morning, we\u2019ve developed a curious, and rather lovely, intimacy. As I stand over him, putting the straw to his lips, he tells me how much he misses being able to scratch his arse. I almost offer to do it for him.</p> <p>But there has been progress. Now he can scratch his face and eyes with his knuckles. It\u2019s amazing how often you need to scratch yourself, he says, and when you have use of your hands you never think about it. \u201cIf you tied your hands up for a day and had to spend the day without their use, you\u2019d see what they mean to you.\u201d</p> <p>He takes another sip of water. \u201cCheers, Simon. It\u2019s great to have a Guardian journalist doing this for me at last!\u201d</p> <p>The book also seems like a love letter to his father, Shannoo, who emigrated from Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1947 and met Kureishi\u2019s English mother Audrey in a London pub. Shannoo spent his working life as a civil servant at the Pakistani embassy in London, but really wanted to be a writer. He wrote many unpublished novels. The depiction of him in The Buddha of Suburbia devastated Kureishi\u2019s sister Yasmin, who wrote a letter to the Guardian saying he had sold his family \u201cdown the line\u201d and she would not stand by and let it be \u201cfabricated for the entertainment of the public or for Hanif\u2019s profit\u201d. She objected to his portrait of the family as working class and their father as a bitter old man.</p> <p>Did she have a point? \u201cMy dad <em>was</em> posh. Really posh. My mum was working class. He came from a very wealthy and privileged family. An educated family. He wasn\u2019t like a traditional immigrant who comes from a village and goes to work in Bradford. He came over to study law and he had 11 siblings and most of them were sent either to the US or the UK to study law or medicine.\u201d Where did the family get the money from? \u201cMy grandfather was a doctor and a colonel in the British army and a big gambler. He was the highest promoted Indian in the army. They had servants and he had a big house.\u201d As for his father, he can\u2019t speak highly enough about him today. \u201cHe was a very friendly, charming guy. He was a beautiful man, a very sweet man.\u201d</p> <p>Why is Kureishi so often described as being of Pakistani heritage rather than Indian? Simple, he says. He was brought up to think of himself as Pakistani. \u201cMy dad went to work in the Pakistan embassy. You can\u2019t work in the Pakistan embassy and call yourself an Indian! So he called himself a Pakistani, even though he\u2019d never been there.\u201d</p> <p>The Buddha of Suburbia was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/apr/17/tetraplegic-hanif-kureishi-buddha-of-suburbia\">adapted for the stage</a> by Kureishi and director Emma Rice earlier this year. He admits he felt uneasy when he watched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/may/01/the-buddha-of-suburbia-review-hanif-kureishi-swan-theatre-stratford-upon-avon\">the play</a>. \u201cI thought, for fuck\u2019s sake, what have I done? That\u2019s my mum, my dad, that\u2019s our house, our street. I\u2019ve put them on the stage and made them look like idiots. I\u2019ve embarrassed myself and I\u2019ve embarrassed them.\u201d</p>    <p>It feels like an apology of sorts. But suddenly he changes tone. \u201cThen I thought, it\u2019s a warm, moving story about race and growing up in England, about pop music, sex, leaving home. It\u2019s not a simple story of Hanif\u2019s put his dad on the stage and made him look like a fool.\u201d</p> <p>So was Yasmin right to say it was unfair on the family? \u201cI would say that\u2019s my story; that\u2019s my version of it, and you have your version of it and somebody else will have their version of it. In any family there would be a collision of utterances.\u201d And now he goes full Kureishi. The regret of a couple of minutes ago has morphed into an audacious celebration of his generosity. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/11/hanif-kureishi-on-bromley-words-were-my-lifeline-out-of-zombie-boredom-\">Growing up in Bromley</a> [in south-east London] in the 70s was boring. Really fucking boring. It was always raining and cold. And you see the play and it\u2019s really funny and lively. I\u2019ve done them a fucking favour. I\u2019ve really brightened it up. There\u2019s a lot of music in it, people are in bands, having sex and being creative.\u201d</p> <p>There is another potential \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d moment in Shattered. While it\u2019s loving towards his father, it\u2019s anything but to his mother. He describes her as \u201cthe most boring person I ever met\u201d, adding that \u201cliking other people was one thing she couldn\u2019t bear\u201d. Was it necessary to write that? \u201cWell, me and my mum always had a beef,\u201d he says. Is she still alive? \u201cNo, she died about four years ago. Tracey warned me about that. She said, \u2018Don\u2019t say that shit about your mum.\u2019 But I believe it. She said, \u2018I liked your mum, she was charming, she was funny, she was sweet.\u2019 Well, I had various beefs with my mum over the years.\u201d Such as? \u201cShe was depressed most of her life. She was very withdrawn.\u201d He calls out to his care worker. \u201cThe coffee\u2019s getting a bit cold, Camilla, d\u2019you mind making some more, please?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Trauma can create opportunity. So you say to yourself, this terrible thing happened to me, but how am I going to adjust to it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s cruel to call her the most boring person you\u2019ve met, I say. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t engage with you,\u201d he protests. \u201cDepressed people can\u2019t. They don\u2019t. It\u2019s not really her fault.\u201d I tell him I\u2019m a depressive and I can engage perfectly well with people. He looks amazed. \u201cHow long have you been depressed?\u201d Most of my life, I say. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem depressed to me. You\u2019ve got a good sense of humour. You\u2019re up for a laugh.\u201d</p> <p>Would he have said she was the most boring person in the world if she\u2019d still been alive? \u201cYep.\u201d How would she have reacted? \u201cI think she would have been offended.\u201d</p> <p>What does he think Yasmin will make of the book? \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bit of a beef going on,\u201d he says. What about? \u201cGod knows. She came to see me in hospital and there was a minor beef. I can\u2019t even remember what it was about.\u201d Has there always been beef? \u201cYeah.\u201d Who\u2019s normally responsible? \u201cWell, as you can imagine she would say, \u2018Oh, he wasn\u2019t very friendly.\u2019 And I\u2019ll say she wasn\u2019t very friendly.\u201d He thinks at some point Sachin will give Yasmin a ring and tell her she and Kureishi should bury their pride and sort out their differences.</p> <p>I\u2019m still thinking about his mother. What does he think it says about him that he felt he had to write about her in this way? \u201cThat writers have a splinter of ice in their heart, as Graham Greene says. When I\u2019m teaching writing, a student tells me a juicy story and I say, \u2018That\u2019s great, write it down\u2019 and they\u2019ll say, \u2018I can\u2019t say that \u2013 if my mum read it, she\u2019d hate me for it.\u2019 And then you think, well, you\u2019re not a fucking writer, are you?\u201d</p> <p>Are the boys similar in character to him? \u201cThey\u2019re very sweet. They\u2019re really good boys, and they\u2019re better children to me than I was to my parents.\u201d</p> <p>He loves being a writer, he says \u2013 possibly more than ever. It might take his carers two and a half hours to get him ready for the day \u2013 breakfast, washing, turning him over, cleaning his catheter, administering suppositories, hoisting him up, dressing him \u2013 but when it\u2019s 10am and he\u2019s sitting in his wheelchair, ready to write, or ready to be helped to write, he feels alive again. \u201cFinally when I\u2019m up, I can become a writer. I can become a human being. I can talk to you, talk&nbsp;to people. And it\u2019s a relief to come back out into the world.\u201d He never thought he would. Kureishi says at times he believed it was pointless going on. But he was so dependent on others that he couldn\u2019t even kill himself without their help.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/apr/17/tetraplegic-hanif-kureishi-buddha-of-suburbia\">\u2018Although I\u2019m tetraplegic, I\u2019ve started to feel normal\u2019: Hanif Kureishi on staging The Buddha of Suburbia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>D\u2019Amico, who has been working upstairs, walks in. Kureishi looks at her adoringly and apologetically. \u201cWe are just talking about how I ruined your life,\u201d he says.</p> <p>She laughs. \u201cAh, how you ruined my life much before the accident? Ten years ago!\u201d</p> <p>I quote a bit from Shattered where he writes, \u201cIsabella is broken by the accident.\u201d Is that how she sees it? \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult question. I\u2019m not precisely happy about the accident, but we are much more organised, we know more things, we are dealing with it pretty well on the whole. We still have a nice time. It\u2019s an adjustment.\u201d </p> <p>The worst time, both agree, is night. \u201cSometimes I wake up in the night,\u201d d\u2019Amico says. \u201cIn the night Hanif\u2019s really pessimistic.\u201d Kureishi\u2019s eyes start to moisten as she talks. \u201cIsabella sleeps upstairs and I have to sleep in the hospital bed. It\u2019s horrible, I don\u2019t want her to sleep alone, but you can\u2019t get two people in that bed.\u201d</p> <p>One positive, she says, is he\u2019s more gregarious. \u201cAfter his accident, Hanif is much more keen on seeing friends. He liked to see friends before, but we were also lazy. I used to travel a lot. He has become more social.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hate being alone,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s depressing.\u201d</p> <p>D\u2019Amico heads off upstairs to get on with her work.</p> <p>Were you crying when she was talking, I ask. \u201cYeah. Well, I don\u2019t want to hear that she\u2019s been hurt by this shit. And I don\u2019t want to feel I\u2019ve inflicted on her a life that she doesn\u2019t want. That\u2019s terrible, that you\u2019ve done this thing to all these people around you. That they have to be devoted to you in a way they didn\u2019t anticipate. You put a terrible strain on other people. So I\u2019ve got to write and keep being productive myself.\u201d</p> <p>Kureishi says writing the book has helped restore his confidence. And, he hopes, this is just the start. As well as the adaptation of The Buddha of Suburbia, he\u2019s working on the follow-up to Shattered and a screenplay for a movie. What\u2019s it about, I ask. He smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be about a bloke staying in Rome who falls on his head and breaks his neck, then wakes up in hospital and has to learn to live again.\u201d</p> <p>He says he\u2019s slowly adjusting to being a disabled person. Are there any pluses? Well, he\u2019s learned more about the realities of life; perhaps he was too cocooned before. \u201cTrauma can create opportunity. So you say to yourself, this terrible thing happened to me, but how am I going to adjust to it and what can I do to speak from it, as it were. So I\u2019ve got a new energy for writing, despite the fact that my body is broken. I\u2019m not going to give up.\u201d</p> <p>The bit of movement that has returned to his hand has given him hope. \u201cI\u2019ve started having occupational therapy and am trying to learn how to write with a pen. I\u2019m like a four-year-old. I can make gestures and movements.\u201d His goal is to be able to write his name, one day. \u201cEventually I\u2019ll be able to sign one of my own books again. That would be a big deal for me.\u201d</p> <p>D\u2019Amico bursts into the room with a sense of urgency. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it. I\u2019ve not been broken. I\u2019ve definitely not been broken,\u201d she says passionately. \u201cI was never broken.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Kureishi says quietly. \u201c\u2018I never noticed he\u2019s a vegetable.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>D\u2019Amico raises her eyes. She\u2019s heard it all before. \u201cAs I say to Hanif, fortunately he\u2019s a talking vegetable.\u201d</p> <p>Does he talk more than he used to? \u201cNo, no,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cNever fucking shuts up,\u201d Kureishi says with a defiant grin.</p> <ul> <li><p>Shattered by Hanif Kureishi (Penguin Books Ltd, \u00a318.99).

      "bodyText": "\u201cI wasn\u2019t even pissed,\u201d Hanif Kureishi says, as if somehow that would have made it better. The writer is talking about the accident that left him a tetraplegic. Or, as he likes to call himself with classic Kureishian brutality, a vegetable. Though he\u2019s not. His body may be broken, but his brain isn\u2019t. It was Boxing Day 2022 and he was in Italy. Back then the writer spent half his idyllic life in Rome, half in London. His three sons were adult and independent, he had enough money to enjoy a good life, he was in love with his wife, Isabella d\u2019Amico, and, at the age of 68, the enfant terrible of English literature was content in a way he\u2019d never been. He was having a beer, watching the football on his iPad, when he had a dizzy spell. He stood up, took a few steps forwards and fainted. He later discovered he had fallen on his head and broken his neck. Kureishi was left paralysed. Would it have made any difference if he had been pissed? \u201cI could have reproached myself more. You seek some kind of explanation; some kind of finality. Why has it happened to me?\u201d At the London Spinal Cord Injury Centre, where he was transferred after spending a year in Italian and English hospitals, he was surrounded by people asking themselves the same question. Virtually all had suffered horrific fluke injuries resulting in broken necks. \u201cSome twat had fallen out of bed and broken his neck. Some other twat had fallen down the stairs and broken his neck.\u201d Twat, in Kureishi\u2019s lexicon, is not an insult \u2013 just a synonym for person. \u201cA nice guy tripped over a rake in his garden and broke his neck. So everybody in there is thinking, what the fuck? One guy, a close friend of mine, a political philosopher and rock climber, fell on his head and was paralysed from the neck down.\u201d Kureishi\u2019s neck break is partial. He still has feeling and movement in his limbs, though he cannot walk or grip with his hands. Kureishi thought his life was over. For starters, he thought he might die. Then, if he did survive, what was the point? He could no longer do anything for himself. The man who had lived a life of belligerent, cussed independence, doing what the hell he wanted when the hell he wanted, was now wholly dependent on others for everything. Almost two years on, he has written a book about the accident and life afterwards. With apt and typical directness, it\u2019s called Shattered. And Kureishi has been in every way. As a writer, he is known for a different kind of shattering \u2013 of taboos. He made his name as the screenwriter of Stephen Frears\u2019s 1985 romcom My Beautiful Laundrette, though romcom suggests a tweeness at odds with the reality. It featured a gay love affair (a rarity 40 years ago) between a young Anglo-Pakistani man and a white skinhead with a history of racist violence (Daniel Day-Lewis in his breakthrough role). The film was a groundbreaking mix of romance, racism and identity politics. Kureishi was nominated for a best original screenplay Oscar. His next film, Sammy and Rosie Get Laid, portrayed a British man of Pakistani ancestry and a white woman in an open marriage, against the backdrop of London lit up by riots. Kureishi\u2019s first and best known novel, The Buddha of Suburbia, is a thinly disguised fictionalisation of his own upbringing that caused huge upset in his family. His 1998 novella Intimacy told the story of a young man leaving his wife and two young sons, with coruscating candour \u2013 Kureishi had just left his wife and two sons. There wasn\u2019t a scab from his private life not worth picking over in his fiction. Kureishi\u2019s subjects were belonging (and not belonging) and transgression. He was calculatedly transgressive. His screenplay for My Son the Fanatic tackled Muslim fundamentalism in 1997, while The Mother is a film about a woman in her mid-60s (played by Anne Reid) initiating an affair with a man in his early 30s (Daniel Craig). Nothing was unsayable or undoable in Kureishi\u2019s work. And it still isn\u2019t. Shattered is exuberantly scatological, soaked in the catheterised piss and enema-extracted shit of his new life. It is also a tribute to those who have helped him through the worst of it; a prolonged screech of injustice; an exploration of dependency in which he portrays himself as half baby, half tyrant; and a defiant fist pump for survival. We meet at the home he shares with d\u2019Amico, an Italian literary publicist, in west London. His 24-hour-a-day care worker Camilla opens the door. Kureishi is waiting for me in the living room. His electric wheelchair is state of the art, with tyres fit for a 4x4. There are any number of prints framed on the walls \u2013 a John Lennon photo here, a Rembrandt self-portrait there, an Ingres nude, family pics, a miniature Alex Ferguson in a tiny glass cup on the mantelpiece (he is an avid Manchester United fan). In the corner is the hospital bed he sleeps on. Kureishi is wearing a sloppy purple jumper and baggy tracksuit bottoms. He used to pride himself on his style, but tells me it\u2019s pointless wearing a smart pair of trousers when you can\u2019t walk. He is warm and curious, wanting to know about life at the Guardian, what else I get up to, which football team I support. He asks if I\u2019d mind sitting on the sofa so he can position his wheelchair to look at me when we chat. Camilla brings him a black coffee with a straw, and a beaker of water. The house is large, on three storeys, but Kureishi tells me he\u2019s not seen the second and third floors since the accident. He is confined to the living room and kitchen, and it frustrates the hell out of him. Having said that, he\u2019s much more positive than he has been, largely because he\u2019s back working. \u201cMost people with spinal injuries never work again. If you\u2019re a ski instructor or a lorry driver, you\u2019re fucked. I met a lot of people in hospital with spinal injuries. They go home, but what they do at home is just watch the TV \u2013 they can\u2019t work. Their lives are over.\u201d He\u2019s lucky to be a writer, he says \u2013 though he has had to learn a new way of writing that requires huge patience, both for him and those helping. It was only a couple of days after the accident that he started writing again. He was desperate to find out if he could still do it. So he dictated his thoughts to d\u2019Amico. \u201cShe would sit on the end of the bed taking dictation. It was madness. I was shouting at her, yelling, half-dead.\u201d Why was he yelling? \u201cUrgency. I had this very strong desire to say something. To see if I could go back to being a writer. I was bombed out of my head on all kinds of shit, but I wanted to find out whether I was still the same person. We did a blog every day. Then the kids came over to Rome and my son Carlo brought his computer, and we started publishing them on Substack.\u201d He talks me through the process. \u201cI\u2019d lie in bed and write the blog in my head, and would see the order of the thoughts. I\u2019d try to memorise the sentences so when Isabella or my boys came [Kureishi has 30-year-old twins Carlo and Sachin with film producer Tracey Scoffield, and Kier, 26, with psychologist Monique Proudlove], I could just dictate it straight to them. I had to learn how to write in this completely new way.\u201d What surprised him, and gave him such hope, was that when they published the blogs on Substack, people wanted to read them. Hundreds, then thousands, then tens of thousands. He realised this was a subject that people wanted to hear about. What\u2019s more, they wanted to hear about it from him. Carlo effectively became his editor. \u201cHe\u2019d tell me I\u2019d missed stuff out, repeated myself. He\u2019d say, \u2018That\u2019s really boring.\u2019\u201d I tell him how much I like the book. \u201cOh good, thank you, mate! All that pain and misery. I don\u2019t know how you enjoy it, but people say they like it.\u201d Perhaps enjoy is not quite the right word. It\u2019s fascinating, painful and very funny against the odds. The coffee has had time to cool. \u201cSimon, could you give me a hit of that coffee, would you mind? Sorry to ask you, mate.\u201d I put the cup to his lips and he sucks from the straw. In the book, he says how angry Sachin gets with him because of his lack of pleases and thank yous. Today, his manners are impeccable. Kureishi says it was only when he came out of hospital that he realised how different he is now from most people. In hospital, pretty much everybody used a wheelchair. \u201cWhen I finally got out on to the street and went up to Shepherd\u2019s Bush [in west London], everyone was walking about, and you think, what the fuck, how can they walk? There are so many of them and there\u2019s one wheelchair on the street. You have to get used to all that, and I have got used to it now.\u201d He\u2019s also getting used to the cost of life as a tetraplegic. \u201cI have physio every day, which I pay for myself and is costing me a fucking fortune \u2013 nearly \u00a3100 a day, so money really matters. If I take a taxi into London to have supper and come back here, the taxi will cost me \u00a3200. Who the fuck has got that kind of money?\u201d But he knows that among the unlucky, he\u2019s one of the luckiest. \u201cOne guy rang me up and said, \u2018I want to give you \u00a325,000.\u2019\u201d What did you say to him? \u201c\u2018Fuck me! For fuck\u2019s sake.\u2019 And he said, \u2018No, I\u2019m going to give it you. I know you\u2019ve got terrible expenses, etc\u2019 and he gave me the money.\u201d Was he a close friend? \u201cHe was a friend, but not a close one. It was so moving and upsetting in a way.\u201d Why upsetting? \u201cThat somebody would be so generous to me and see what a pickle I was in and what I needed.\u201d Was it hard to accept? \u201cI felt embarrassed. You don\u2019t want to ask people for money. I didn\u2019t ask him for money. I would never ask for money. So I felt embarrassed, yeah. Suddenly you become a supplicant.\u201d There are the friends who come round, bring food, feed him, brush his teeth, give him a head massage and read him a bedtime story. They spend hours with him. He\u2019s humbled by their generosity and it\u2019s made him question what kind of person he was before the accident. \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful that somebody\u2019s doing this for me. Then you think, would I do this for someone else, and I think it wouldn\u2019t occur to me. Most of the people who do all that for me are women, and you think, I wish I could do this for them now. But it\u2019s too late for me to do this now, and I regret I didn\u2019t do it before.\u201d In Shattered, he writes, \u201cI wish I had been kinder. If I get another chance I will be.\u201d But he knows he won\u2019t get the chance to help people in the way they have helped him. The selfishness of his former life is a recurring theme in Shattered. He\u2019s not apologising for his past, just acknowledging it. He calls himself an \u201copportunist social climber\u201d and says he loved hanging out with the older generation of British literary heavyweights \u2013 Salman Rushdie, Martin Amis, Julian Barnes. The mid-80s through to the 90s was a wonderful time for writers \u2013 advances were huge and plentiful. He might have been politically on the left, but he didn\u2019t half benefit from the Thatcherite ethos. \u201cIn the 1980s, selfishness was the character ideal of the age, and fucking hell was it fun.\u201d He makes no bones about being numero uno in his life. There was always a laddishness to Kureishi\u2019s writing; a desire to prod and shock. In Shattered, he writes about his proneness to choking since the accident. \u201cI am more intimate with the Heimlich manoeuvre than cunnilingus.\u201d To even think of comparing the two takes a degree of perversity. He boasts about taking cocaine with his sons. After fantasising about \u201cthe world of filth and depravity\u201d, he is reminded \u201chow close sexuality and disgust have to be for sex to retain its edge\u201d. Shattered is sex obsessed. But this time it\u2019s not sex as a possibility or inevitability, it\u2019s sex as an impossibility. The accident has left him impotent. I tell him he reminds me of Michael Gambon\u2019s Philip Marlow in The Singing Detective, hospitalised, in psoriatic agony, but instead of trying to think of unsexy things to stifle an erection, here he\u2019s conjuring up sexual fantasies to see if he\u2019s capable of getting one. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a very perceptive thing to say. I was lying in bed like Michael Gambon in that show with these beautiful Italian nurses washing you and cleaning you, and you can\u2019t feel anything. Your sexuality has gone for ever. They\u2019re leaning over you, and they smell beautiful, and they\u2019ve got great eyebrows, and all your dreams have come true. You\u2019ve got three nurses tending to you, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u201d Kureishi is incorrigible. You sense he really does believe that if only he\u2019d been in full working order, the nurses would have jumped into his hospital bed to enable him to fulfil their fantasies. In Shattered, to see if he can get himself going, he recalls a threesome he had in his promiscuous 40s after he had left his first wife. A younger woman he hooked up with in Amsterdam gets in touch to tell him she\u2019s in Britain. He asks her to visit him. Would you like me to bring anything, she asks. Yes, he says \u2013 chocolate, weed, magic mushrooms and a friend. What strikes me about the passage, I tell Kureishi, is the way you depict yourself as a taker rather than a giver. He smiles. \u201cWell, that night I was obviously looking for an adventure, but I wouldn\u2019t say that was an everyday experience. I wrote about it because I thought it was funny.\u201d It\u2019s also bathetic. \u201cIt was a disappointment,\u201d he admits. \u201cI\u2019d been expecting a threesome with two women and she turned up with her boyfriend who was the same age as me, clinically depressed and barely said anything. He just sat on the end of the bed with his head in his hands watching me fuck his girlfriend.\u201d He launches into a spluttering phlegmy cough. It sounds so uncomfortable for him. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he says when he gets his breath back. \u201cCoughing is really important to clear your lungs, and I\u2019ve got reduced capacity. It\u2019s difficult for me to clear my lungs.\u201d * * * Kureishi tells me about Nietzsche\u2019s theory of the eternal recurrence \u2013 the philosophical concept that our lives will repeat infinitely and in each life every detail will be exactly the same. He says he lay in his hospital bed, revisiting the past, asking himself whether he\u2019d want to change it. \u201cYou can\u2019t live a life without thinking how stupid you were and what a mistake that was, and how self-sabotaging that was. I\u2019ve been in therapy for a long time, and my therapist kept me from some of my more self-destructive impulses to do with substances and bad relationships and stupid behaviour. And having kids has also kept me on the straight and narrow.\u201d When he totted up his balance sheet, he concluded the one thing he wouldn\u2019t change at all is his time with d\u2019Amico. \u201cShe\u2019s my destiny; the person I want to be with.\u201d Did he ever think something awful could happen to disturb that contentment? \u201cYes. When I turned the TV off and went into the kitchen to close the windows at night, I used to look out and think, how much longer is this going to go on? There\u2019ll be a day when this happiness will end. I always thought that way.\u201d Shattered is as savage as anything he\u2019s written, but it\u2019s also in large part a love letter to all those who have supported him \u2013 friends; strangers on the street; his sons; d\u2019Amico; Scoffield, who emerges as heroic. \u201cWhen I go out on the street, people come up to me all the time and say, \u2018Well done, mate, I love your writing.\u2019 Nobody approached me before. Now it\u2019s every day. I\u2019ve become a local celebrity because of the blog.\u201d In a way he wasn\u2019t before? \u201cIt\u2019s the disability. It\u2019s pity. And it\u2019s love. And it\u2019s their generosity. You realise how kind people are. How loving they are.\u201d He seems so astonished by the world\u2019s kindness, I wonder if it\u2019s because he himself used to have an unkind view of the world. Perhaps fans didn\u2019t approach him because he seemed unapproachable \u2013 too cool for school. He doesn\u2019t have time to answer before he is hit by another phlegmy coughing fit. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he says. Time for a drink. Over the morning, we\u2019ve developed a curious, and rather lovely, intimacy. As I stand over him, putting the straw to his lips, he tells me how much he misses being able to scratch his arse. I almost offer to do it for him. But there has been progress. Now he can scratch his face and eyes with his knuckles. It\u2019s amazing how often you need to scratch yourself, he says, and when you have use of your hands you never think about it. \u201cIf you tied your hands up for a day and had to spend the day without their use, you\u2019d see what they mean to you.\u201d He takes another sip of water. \u201cCheers, Simon. It\u2019s great to have a Guardian journalist doing this for me at last!\u201d The book also seems like a love letter to his father, Shannoo, who emigrated from Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1947 and met Kureishi\u2019s English mother Audrey in a London pub. Shannoo spent his working life as a civil servant at the Pakistani embassy in London, but really wanted to be a writer. He wrote many unpublished novels. The depiction of him in The Buddha of Suburbia devastated Kureishi\u2019s sister Yasmin, who wrote a letter to the Guardian saying he had sold his family \u201cdown the line\u201d and she would not stand by and let it be \u201cfabricated for the entertainment of the public or for Hanif\u2019s profit\u201d. She objected to his portrait of the family as working class and their father as a bitter old man. Did she have a point? \u201cMy dad was posh. Really posh. My mum was working class. He came from a very wealthy and privileged family. An educated family. He wasn\u2019t like a traditional immigrant who comes from a village and goes to work in Bradford. He came over to study law and he had 11 siblings and most of them were sent either to the US or the UK to study law or medicine.\u201d Where did the family get the money from? \u201cMy grandfather was a doctor and a colonel in the British army and a big gambler. He was the highest promoted Indian in the army. They had servants and he had a big house.\u201d As for his father, he can\u2019t speak highly enough about him today. \u201cHe was a very friendly, charming guy. He was a beautiful man, a very sweet man.\u201d Why is Kureishi so often described as being of Pakistani heritage rather than Indian? Simple, he says. He was brought up to think of himself as Pakistani. \u201cMy dad went to work in the Pakistan embassy. You can\u2019t work in the Pakistan embassy and call yourself an Indian! So he called himself a Pakistani, even though he\u2019d never been there.\u201d The Buddha of Suburbia was adapted for the stage by Kureishi and director Emma Rice earlier this year. He admits he felt uneasy when he watched the play. \u201cI thought, for fuck\u2019s sake, what have I done? That\u2019s my mum, my dad, that\u2019s our house, our street. I\u2019ve put them on the stage and made them look like idiots. I\u2019ve embarrassed myself and I\u2019ve embarrassed them.\u201d It feels like an apology of sorts. But suddenly he changes tone. \u201cThen I thought, it\u2019s a warm, moving story about race and growing up in England, about pop music, sex, leaving home. It\u2019s not a simple story of Hanif\u2019s put his dad on the stage and made him look like a fool.\u201d So was Yasmin right to say it was unfair on the family? \u201cI would say that\u2019s my story; that\u2019s my version of it, and you have your version of it and somebody else will have their version of it. In any family there would be a collision of utterances.\u201d And now he goes full Kureishi. The regret of a couple of minutes ago has morphed into an audacious celebration of his generosity. \u201cGrowing up in Bromley [in south-east London] in the 70s was boring. Really fucking boring. It was always raining and cold. And you see the play and it\u2019s really funny and lively. I\u2019ve done them a fucking favour. I\u2019ve really brightened it up. There\u2019s a lot of music in it, people are in bands, having sex and being creative.\u201d There is another potential \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d moment in Shattered. While it\u2019s loving towards his father, it\u2019s anything but to his mother. He describes her as \u201cthe most boring person I ever met\u201d, adding that \u201cliking other people was one thing she couldn\u2019t bear\u201d. Was it necessary to write that? \u201cWell, me and my mum always had a beef,\u201d he says. Is she still alive? \u201cNo, she died about four years ago. Tracey warned me about that. She said, \u2018Don\u2019t say that shit about your mum.\u2019 But I believe it. She said, \u2018I liked your mum, she was charming, she was funny, she was sweet.\u2019 Well, I had various beefs with my mum over the years.\u201d Such as? \u201cShe was depressed most of her life. She was very withdrawn.\u201d He calls out to his care worker. \u201cThe coffee\u2019s getting a bit cold, Camilla, d\u2019you mind making some more, please?\u201d It\u2019s cruel to call her the most boring person you\u2019ve met, I say. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t engage with you,\u201d he protests. \u201cDepressed people can\u2019t. They don\u2019t. It\u2019s not really her fault.\u201d I tell him I\u2019m a depressive and I can engage perfectly well with people. He looks amazed. \u201cHow long have you been depressed?\u201d Most of my life, I say. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem depressed to me. You\u2019ve got a good sense of humour. You\u2019re up for a laugh.\u201d Would he have said she was the most boring person in the world if she\u2019d still been alive? \u201cYep.\u201d How would she have reacted? \u201cI think she would have been offended.\u201d What does he think Yasmin will make of the book? \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bit of a beef going on,\u201d he says. What about? \u201cGod knows. She came to see me in hospital and there was a minor beef. I can\u2019t even remember what it was about.\u201d Has there always been beef? \u201cYeah.\u201d Who\u2019s normally responsible? \u201cWell, as you can imagine she would say, \u2018Oh, he wasn\u2019t very friendly.\u2019 And I\u2019ll say she wasn\u2019t very friendly.\u201d He thinks at some point Sachin will give Yasmin a ring and tell her she and Kureishi should bury their pride and sort out their differences. I\u2019m still thinking about his mother. What does he think it says about him that he felt he had to write about her in this way? \u201cThat writers have a splinter of ice in their heart, as Graham Greene says. When I\u2019m teaching writing, a student tells me a juicy story and I say, \u2018That\u2019s great, write it down\u2019 and they\u2019ll say, \u2018I can\u2019t say that \u2013 if my mum read it, she\u2019d hate me for it.\u2019 And then you think, well, you\u2019re not a fucking writer, are you?\u201d Are the boys similar in character to him? \u201cThey\u2019re very sweet. They\u2019re really good boys, and they\u2019re better children to me than I was to my parents.\u201d He loves being a writer, he says \u2013 possibly more than ever. It might take his carers two and a half hours to get him ready for the day \u2013 breakfast, washing, turning him over, cleaning his catheter, administering suppositories, hoisting him up, dressing him \u2013 but when it\u2019s 10am and he\u2019s sitting in his wheelchair, ready to write, or ready to be helped to write, he feels alive again. \u201cFinally when I\u2019m up, I can become a writer. I can become a human being. I can talk to you, talk to people. And it\u2019s a relief to come back out into the world.\u201d He never thought he would. Kureishi says at times he believed it was pointless going on. But he was so dependent on others that he couldn\u2019t even kill himself without their help. D\u2019Amico, who has been working upstairs, walks in. Kureishi looks at her adoringly and apologetically. \u201cWe are just talking about how I ruined your life,\u201d he says. She laughs. \u201cAh, how you ruined my life much before the accident? Ten years ago!\u201d I quote a bit from Shattered where he writes, \u201cIsabella is broken by the accident.\u201d Is that how she sees it? \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult question. I\u2019m not precisely happy about the accident, but we are much more organised, we know more things, we are dealing with it pretty well on the whole. We still have a nice time. It\u2019s an adjustment.\u201d The worst time, both agree, is night. \u201cSometimes I wake up in the night,\u201d d\u2019Amico says. \u201cIn the night Hanif\u2019s really pessimistic.\u201d Kureishi\u2019s eyes start to moisten as she talks. \u201cIsabella sleeps upstairs and I have to sleep in the hospital bed. It\u2019s horrible, I don\u2019t want her to sleep alone, but you can\u2019t get two people in that bed.\u201d One positive, she says, is he\u2019s more gregarious. \u201cAfter his accident, Hanif is much more keen on seeing friends. He liked to see friends before, but we were also lazy. I used to travel a lot. He has become more social.\u201d \u201cI hate being alone,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s depressing.\u201d D\u2019Amico heads off upstairs to get on with her work. Were you crying when she was talking, I ask. \u201cYeah. Well, I don\u2019t want to hear that she\u2019s been hurt by this shit. And I don\u2019t want to feel I\u2019ve inflicted on her a life that she doesn\u2019t want. That\u2019s terrible, that you\u2019ve done this thing to all these people around you. That they have to be devoted to you in a way they didn\u2019t anticipate. You put a terrible strain on other people. So I\u2019ve got to write and keep being productive myself.\u201d Kureishi says writing the book has helped restore his confidence. And, he hopes, this is just the start. As well as the adaptation of The Buddha of Suburbia, he\u2019s working on the follow-up to Shattered and a screenplay for a movie. What\u2019s it about, I ask. He smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be about a bloke staying in Rome who falls on his head and breaks his neck, then wakes up in hospital and has to learn to live again.\u201d He says he\u2019s slowly adjusting to being a disabled person. Are there any pluses? Well, he\u2019s learned more about the realities of life; perhaps he was too cocooned before. \u201cTrauma can create opportunity. So you say to yourself, this terrible thing happened to me, but how am I going to adjust to it and what can I do to speak from it, as it were. So I\u2019ve got a new energy for writing, despite the fact that my body is broken. I\u2019m not going to give up.\u201d The bit of movement that has returned to his hand has given him hope. \u201cI\u2019ve started having occupational therapy and am trying to learn how to write with a pen. I\u2019m like a four-year-old. I can make gestures and movements.\u201d His goal is to be able to write his name, one day. \u201cEventually I\u2019ll be able to sign one of my own books again. That would be a big deal for me.\u201d D\u2019Amico bursts into the room with a sense of urgency. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it. I\u2019ve not been broken. I\u2019ve definitely not been broken,\u201d she says passionately. \u201cI was never broken.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Kureishi says quietly. \u201c\u2018I never noticed he\u2019s a vegetable.\u2019\u201d D\u2019Amico raises her eyes. She\u2019s heard it all before. \u201cAs I say to Hanif, fortunately he\u2019s a talking vegetable.\u201d Does he talk more than he used to? \u201cNo, no,\u201d she says. \u201cNever fucking shuts up,\u201d Kureishi says with a defiant grin.

      "body": "<p>Scorching sunlight glinted through the windows as the bartender slid a frosted glass of Cruzcampo across the aluminium bar. \u201c<em>Ocho meses de invierno</em><em>, c</em><em>uatro de infierno</em>,\u201d he sighed with a nod towards the heat-shimmering lane outside. \u201cEight months of winter, four months of hell\u201d is how the inhabitants of Extremadura describe their climate.</p> <p>Your timing needs to be good if you\u2019re planning a hike through the isolated steppes and forested hills that&nbsp;seem to form a barrier \u2013 a barely inhabited no man\u2019s land \u2013 between Madrid and the Portuguese border. Spring bursts briefly here \u2013 a rainbow-coloured wedge of wildflowers driven between winter and summer.</p>    <p>It\u2019s autumn, however \u2013 when the <em>dehesa</em> woodlands glow in spectacular fiery hues \u2013 that is the best time for hiking in Extremadura.</p> <p>This far-flung region was considered extreme long before the Romans tried to tame it with a chain of fortress cities along what would later become famous as the Via de la Plata, toughest of the pilgrim routes that lead to Santiago de Compostela. Not everybody can dedicate the six or seven weeks needed to walk the 620 miles (1,000km) between Seville and Santiago, but a week\u2019s hiking through the wilderness landscapes and historic communities of Extremadura offers a&nbsp;compelling introduction to Spain\u2019s least-known region.</p> <p>While I had travelled often in this area in the past, I\u2019d first developed a&nbsp;real appreciation of its diversity during a recent coast-to-coast walk from Gibraltar to Estaca de Bares (the&nbsp;most northerly tip on the Iberian peninsula). During that 700-mile solo&nbsp;hike, I\u2019d slept rough \u2013 either in my&nbsp;hammock or on the stony ground \u2013 as I&nbsp;collected material for my book, Vagabond: A Hiker\u2019s Homage to Rural Spain. I\u2019d been thrilled as much by the&nbsp;rugged hillsides and ancient cork forests \u2013 home to lynx, deer and wild boar \u2013 as I had been by the seemingly endless plains, where the grass rippled under a hot breeze that brought to mind African savannahs.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I was thrilled by the seemingly endless plains where the grass rippled under a hot breeze that brought to mind African savannahs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While I averaged 22 miles a day during that midsummer hike, I would recommend an autumn departure and a far slower pace, allowing ample time to savour the best of backcountry Spain. The hike northwards from M\u00e9rida to C\u00e1ceres could easily be done in three days, but extending it for a&nbsp;further three (and a total of 90 miles) across more challenging terrain to the historic little towns of Ca\u00f1averal and Galisteo is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to savour Extremadura at its wildest. Navigation is easy because the Via de la Plata route is well marked, with either yellow arrows or the scallop-shell emblem of the pilgrimage. M\u00e9rida (easily reached by public transport from Madrid) is the logical launchpad for a walk through this historic heartland.</p>    <p>It\u2019s hard to imagine that this sleepy provincial city, with a&nbsp;population these days of around 60,000, was once known as Emerita Augusta and boasted a garrison of 90,000 Roman soldiers. The typical stage for pilgrims from here is a relatively short 11-mile saunter to the village of Aljuc\u00e9n, so there\u2019s time before you walk out of M\u00e9rida to buy the pilgrim\u2019s passport, the document that will allow you to stay in municipal <em>albergues</em> (hostels). It costs \u20ac3 and is available from <em>albergues</em> and tourist offices along the route.</p> <p>Landlocked Extremadura obviously isn\u2019t famous for its beaches. It had been a highpoint of my hike, therefore, when I enjoyed a lazy afternoon swimming and sunbathing on a \u201cbeach\u201d, two weeks after I\u2019d last seen the Andaluc\u00edan coastline. Proserpina Dam (less than two hours\u2019 walk north of M\u00e9rida) has been a place of rest for wayfarers since it was built by Roman engineers 2,000 years ago. With its fringe of dusty pines and whitewashed villas, this shimmering sheet of blue water is more reminiscent of a scene from a Greek island.</p> <p>Try to stifle your enthusiasm for getting back on the trail and take time instead for a leisurely lunch of grilled fish from one of the two <em>chiringuitos</em> (beach bars), which open all year, since less than three hours\u2019 hiking remain, through the oak forests to the hamlet of Aljuc\u00e9n and your first night\u2019s accommodation.</p>    <p>The Extremadura section of the Via&nbsp;de la Plata must be one of Europe\u2019s most affordable hiking trips. In Aljuc\u00e9n, for example, pilgrims can get a dorm bed in <a href=\"https://www.caminodesantiago.me/camino-guides/en/accommodations/via-de-la-plata/aljucen/albergue-san-andres\">Albergue San Andr\u00e9s</a> for \u20ac12 and a <em>men\u00fa del d\u00eda</em> in the village bar for just \u20ac10. For an upgrade you can\u2019t ask for better value than the lovely, four-star <a href=\"https://www.aqualibera.com/\">Termas Aqua Libera</a>, which still boasts functioning Roman baths (with a discount for pilgrims).</p> <p>During the next five days, distances increase steadily, but your stamina and walking fitness will also improve. From Aljuc\u00e9n it\u2019s a 12-mile hike across the forested foothills of the Sierra de San Pedro to the town of Alcu\u00e9scar, where there\u2019s an opportunity to experience a very poignant part of the&nbsp;pilgrim philosophy: the local <a href=\"https://www.esclavosdemariaydelospobres.es/\">monastery</a> here offers dorms run on the <em>donativo</em> principal, where pilgrims are simply invited to pay whatever they can afford.</p> <p>The following day\u2019s route follows a&nbsp;gently descending path for 16 miles to Valdesalor, where you simply collect the <em>albergue</em> keys from the village grocery store and make yourself at home. (Again, there\u2019s an affordable inn with private rooms if you\u2019re looking for an upgrade.)

      "bodyText": "Scorching sunlight glinted through the windows as the bartender slid a frosted glass of Cruzcampo across the aluminium bar. \u201cOcho meses de invierno, cuatro de infierno,\u201d he sighed with a nod towards the heat-shimmering lane outside. \u201cEight months of winter, four months of hell\u201d is how the inhabitants of Extremadura describe their climate. Your timing needs to be good if you\u2019re planning a hike through the isolated steppes and forested hills that seem to form a barrier \u2013 a barely inhabited no man\u2019s land \u2013 between Madrid and the Portuguese border. Spring bursts briefly here \u2013 a rainbow-coloured wedge of wildflowers driven between winter and summer. It\u2019s autumn, however \u2013 when the dehesa woodlands glow in spectacular fiery hues \u2013 that is the best time for hiking in Extremadura. This far-flung region was considered extreme long before the Romans tried to tame it with a chain of fortress cities along what would later become famous as the Via de la Plata, toughest of the pilgrim routes that lead to Santiago de Compostela. Not everybody can dedicate the six or seven weeks needed to walk the 620 miles (1,000km) between Seville and Santiago, but a week\u2019s hiking through the wilderness landscapes and historic communities of Extremadura offers a compelling introduction to Spain\u2019s least-known region. While I had travelled often in this area in the past, I\u2019d first developed a real appreciation of its diversity during a recent coast-to-coast walk from Gibraltar to Estaca de Bares (the most northerly tip on the Iberian peninsula). During that 700-mile solo hike, I\u2019d slept rough \u2013 either in my hammock or on the stony ground \u2013 as I collected material for my book, Vagabond: A Hiker\u2019s Homage to Rural Spain. I\u2019d been thrilled as much by the rugged hillsides and ancient cork forests \u2013 home to lynx, deer and wild boar \u2013 as I had been by the seemingly endless plains, where the grass rippled under a hot breeze that brought to mind African savannahs. While I averaged 22 miles a day during that midsummer hike, I would recommend an autumn departure and a far slower pace, allowing ample time to savour the best of backcountry Spain. The hike northwards from M\u00e9rida to C\u00e1ceres could easily be done in three days, but extending it for a further three (and a total of 90 miles) across more challenging terrain to the historic little towns of Ca\u00f1averal and Galisteo is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to savour Extremadura at its wildest. Navigation is easy because the Via de la Plata route is well marked, with either yellow arrows or the scallop-shell emblem of the pilgrimage. M\u00e9rida (easily reached by public transport from Madrid) is the logical launchpad for a walk through this historic heartland. It\u2019s hard to imagine that this sleepy provincial city, with a population these days of around 60,000, was once known as Emerita Augusta and boasted a garrison of 90,000 Roman soldiers. The typical stage for pilgrims from here is a relatively short 11-mile saunter to the village of Aljuc\u00e9n, so there\u2019s time before you walk out of M\u00e9rida to buy the pilgrim\u2019s passport, the document that will allow you to stay in municipal albergues (hostels). It costs \u20ac3 and is available from albergues and tourist offices along the route. Landlocked Extremadura obviously isn\u2019t famous for its beaches. It had been a highpoint of my hike, therefore, when I enjoyed a lazy afternoon swimming and sunbathing on a \u201cbeach\u201d, two weeks after I\u2019d last seen the Andaluc\u00edan coastline. Proserpina Dam (less than two hours\u2019 walk north of M\u00e9rida) has been a place of rest for wayfarers since it was built by Roman engineers 2,000 years ago. With its fringe of dusty pines and whitewashed villas, this shimmering sheet of blue water is more reminiscent of a scene from a Greek island. Try to stifle your enthusiasm for getting back on the trail and take time instead for a leisurely lunch of grilled fish from one of the two chiringuitos (beach bars), which open all year, since less than three hours\u2019 hiking remain, through the oak forests to the hamlet of Aljuc\u00e9n and your first night\u2019s accommodation. The Extremadura section of the Via de la Plata must be one of Europe\u2019s most affordable hiking trips. In Aljuc\u00e9n, for example, pilgrims can get a dorm bed in Albergue San Andr\u00e9s for \u20ac12 and a men\u00fa del d\u00eda in the village bar for just \u20ac10. For an upgrade you can\u2019t ask for better value than the lovely, four-star Termas Aqua Libera, which still boasts functioning Roman baths (with a discount for pilgrims). During the next five days, distances increase steadily, but your stamina and walking fitness will also improve. From Aljuc\u00e9n it\u2019s a 12-mile hike across the forested foothills of the Sierra de San Pedro to the town of Alcu\u00e9scar, where there\u2019s an opportunity to experience a very poignant part of the pilgrim philosophy: the local monastery here offers dorms run on the donativo principal, where pilgrims are simply invited to pay whatever they can afford. The following day\u2019s route follows a gently descending path for 16 miles to Valdesalor, where you simply collect the albergue keys from the village grocery store and make yourself at home. (Again, there\u2019s an affordable inn with private rooms if you\u2019re looking for an upgrade.) There\u2019s not much to keep you in Valdesalor, but it\u2019s worthwhile getting on the trail early the next day anyway so you can enter the walled city of C\u00e1ceres in time for breakfast. Walking through the Puerto del R\u00edo gateway, built in the first century, it\u2019s easy to imagine the awe with which these mighty citadels must have struck medieval wayfarers. Having walked 45 miles since leaving M\u00e9rida, you could make C\u00e1ceres an honourable final stop after a three-day hike, but it would be a shame to stop now, right on the edge of some of Spain\u2019s most evocative landscapes.

      "body": "<p>Cooking without recipes is a great way to reduce waste in the kitchen because it helps to use up all sorts of odds and ends. Soups, stews and smoothies are the obvious starting points, but, as your confidence grows, you can learn to adapt trickier recipes such as baked goods to use up a wider range of the ingredients in your pantry. My five-year-old daughter loves to invent recipes with me, and<strong> </strong>we recently made muffins using some brown bananas (her idea) and a variety of flours, dried fruit, nuts and seeds.</p> <h2>Magical pantry muffins</h2> <p>Although the <a href=\"https://thelilycafe.com/\">Lily Cafe</a> blogger Kat suggests adding two to four tablespoons of sugar per egg to your muffin, I like to extend the ratio and add one part sweetener, instead, making the ratio \u201cdouble two, triple one\u201d, which is still easy to remember. Although some baking recipes need to be very precise, muffins are a little more forgiving, so get inventive, experiment and see what works for you.

I used whole spelt flour with baking powder. The liquid element covers water, milk (or plant-based alternative) and mashed or pureed soft fruit or vegetables, such as brown banana flesh, or apple or pumpkin puree. The fat, too, should be liquid \u2013 for example, melted butter, vegetable oil or olive oil. As for the eggs, an egg weighs about 50-60g, so if you are making a small batch of muffins with, say, 200g flour and liquid, you will need two eggs (ie, just over 100g), but if you have a little more or less, don\u2019t worry: as I said earlier, this recipe is forgiving. And as for the sweetener, just about any will work, from sugar or honey to maple syrup.</p>    <p>Any extras (added to taste) are up to you: chopped or whole dried fruit and nuts or seeds, chocolate chips and other tasty nibbles are always welcome in a muffin.

      "bodyText": "Cooking without recipes is a great way to reduce waste in the kitchen because it helps to use up all sorts of odds and ends. Soups, stews and smoothies are the obvious starting points, but, as your confidence grows, you can learn to adapt trickier recipes such as baked goods to use up a wider range of the ingredients in your pantry. My five-year-old daughter loves to invent recipes with me, and we recently made muffins using some brown bananas (her idea) and a variety of flours, dried fruit, nuts and seeds.

Lammy is due to travel to China next week for high-level meetings in his first trip to the country as foreign secretary. The British-Taiwanese all-party parliamentary group (APPG) had been in talks to host Tsai Ing-wen, the former president of Taiwan, in parliament this month. But the plans for a visit were postponed after the Foreign Office indicated it could scupper Lammy\u2019s imminent trip to China, three sources told the Guardian. \u201cWe got a note from the FCDO via the Taiwanese representative to the UK,\u201d said one person who had been involved in the discussions to host Tsai. \u201cIt said: \u2018Please can you defer this for a while because the foreign secretary is about to make a \u201cgoodwill visit\u201d to China and this would absolutely put the kibosh on it.\u2019\u201d The revelation is embarrassing for the new Labour government, which has sought to improve relations with Beijing after they deteriorated under the Conservatives.

The plans for a visit by Tsai have been postponed until the spring. While parliament does not need the government\u2019s permission to organise it, the APPG was hoping Whitehall would facilitate the trip, including by providing security. Parliamentary authorities had also been involved in the discussions. Frances D\u2019Souza, a crossbench peer who is a member of the APPG and attended the inauguration of the new Taiwanese president, Lai Ching-te, last spring, said: \u201cWe very much hope to host former President Tsai Ing-wen in parliament in the near future. While we understand the political sensitivities, parliament is a democratic forum open to many different voices and views.\u201d Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, the Labour chair of the defence select committee, said Taiwan was an \u201cimportant and valued partner for the UK, and we should do all we can to strengthen ties\u201d, adding: \u201cI hope the government will make it clear to former President Tsai, whom I met while on a parliamentary delegation visit to Taiwan, that she is indeed very welcome here.\u201d Tsai is visiting several European countries this month in her first international tour since leaving office. She is due in Prague and Brussels in the next week and is also expected to go to France, according to reports. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: \u201cMinisterial travel will be confirmed in the usual way. We do not comment on speculation.\u201d The Taipei representative office in the UK did not respond to a request for comment. The UK does not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but has a longstanding unofficial relationship and a history of visits. A delegation of Labour parliamentarians led by the peer Sonny Leong travelled to Taiwan and met Tsai last April, shortly before she stepped down as president. The visit was strongly condemned by China\u2019s embassy in London, which accused the parliamentarians of \u201cserious interference in China\u2019s internal affairs\u201d. China views Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually come under Beijing\u2019s control, and there are fears it will eventually try to annex the island by force. Taiwan, which has never been ruled by the People\u2019s Republic of China, sees itself as distinct and has its own constitution and democratically elected leaders, and has grown increasingly opposed to China\u2019s claims of sovereignty over it. In the presidential election last January voters elected Lai, who has pledged to uphold Taiwan\u2019s self-governing status. In their approach to China, Labour ministers have argued that they want to collaborate with Beijing on areas including trade and climate change while remaining clear-eyed on the security threat and human rights concerns.

      "bodyText": "Much of Australia\u2019s south will likely bask in temperatures up to 8C hotter than normal next week, which could trigger an increased risk of thunderstorms over wide areas. A dome of heat that has put parts of the Northern Territory under heatwave warnings is set to spread east and west in the coming days, before moving south by the middle of next week, the Bureau of Meteorology said. Parts of the Top End around Darwin have sweltered under a heatwave for much of the last two weeks, with temperatures up to 5C above normal and hitting 41C. The bureau\u2019s official heatwave warning is likely to stay in place for a few more days, and the heat is expected to spread into Western Australia\u2019s Kimberley and east over the Cape York peninsula in the early part of the week. Angus Hines, senior meteorologist at the bureau, said on Saturday: \u201cSome of that heat from the north-west will be spreading into central Australia. It\u2019s going to be a gradual build as that heat moves over the course of a few days starting from today.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email By Wednesday or Thursday, Hines said forecast models showed temperatures 4C to 8C above average stretching from the centre of WA to the New South Wales coast. \u201cMost of the country will be seeing above average temperatures,\u201d he said. The early part of the week would also carry the risk of thunderstorms across large areas of the south and east. \u201cWe will see the humidity climb and that combination of warmth and humidity could feed thunderstorm developments across eastern states,\u201d Hines said. \u201cIt\u2019s a messy map with broad areas that could be hit and miss [for storms]. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint the detail \u2026 but there\u2019s multiple areas for thunderstorm activity from Monday to Wednesday.\u201d Hines said the area of likely thunderstorm development was across NSW, Victoria, southern Queensland and northern Tasmania. The bureau\u2019s latest long-range outlook, updated on Thursday, was pointing to a hot and wet start to the summer across many areas. Wetter than usual conditions were forecast between October and December across most of the country and, with water storages high and soils wet, this would increase the risk of flooding in the north, east and across Tasmania, the bureau said. In November, everywhere except the areas in and around Sydney and Brisbane were expected to have above average daytime temperatures and the whole country would likely have warmer than average nights. Global heating, caused mostly by the burning of fossil fuels, has seen the Australian continent warm by 1.5C since 1910. This September was Australia\u2019s fourth hottest on record, coming after the hottest August on record.",

Yamamoto allowed two hits over five innings for the Dodgers before being pulled after 63 pitches in a decisive Game 5 between heated NL West rivals who were meeting in a Division Series for the third time in five years. Shohei Ohtani and the Dodgers will play the wild-card New York Mets in the best-of-seven NLCS starting Sunday night in Los Angeles. The Dodgers won a decisive Game 5 at home for the first time since taking a 1981 NL Division Series against Houston after a season split into halves following a players\u2019 strike. Boasting the majors\u2019 best regular-season record of 98-64, they successfully avoided a third straight NLDS elimination.

Darvish and Ohtani teamed to help win last year\u2019s World Baseball Classic for Japan, but they were rivals Friday. Ohtani struck out three times, including twice against Darvish in a game watched on Saturday morning in Japan.

The Padres ended the series by not scoring since the second inning of Game 3. Yamamoto successfully covered first base three times after inducing grounders, making it easier on All-Star first baseman Freddie Freeman who started after missing Game 4 with a sprained right ankle. The Dodgers led 1-0 on the drive by Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez with two outs in the second. It was the 14th career postseason homer for Hern\u00e1ndez, who was brought back to the Dodgers this season to make an impact in October. Whether he makes it with the FCC remains to be seen.",

The Ukrainian president, on a whirlwind tour of European capitals to discuss his proposed \u201cvictory plan\u201d for the war with Russia, said he had also invited the Vatican to take part in a conference on the prisoners of war, due to be held in Canada later this month. \u201cWe are counting on the Holy See\u2019s assistance in helping to bring back Ukrainians who have been taken captive by Russia,\u201d Zelenskyy said on social media, adding this was the main topic of his talks with the pope on Friday. A Vatican readout provided no details about the pope\u2019s talks with Zelenskyy but said a subsequent meeting between the Ukrainian leader and the Vatican\u2019s chief diplomat had included discussions \u201cdedicated to the state of the war \u2026 as well as the ways in which it could be brought to an end\u201d.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Zelenskyy voiced hope that the war with Russia would end next year, speaking in Berlin during a visit to ask for sustained military support</strong>. Talking to the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, the Ukrainian leader thanked Germany for its backing and said it was \u201cvery important for us that this assistance does not decrease next year\u201d. He said he would present Scholz with his plan for winning the war, voicing hope that the conflict would end \u201cno later than next year, 2025\u201d. Scholz pledged Germany and European Union partners would send more defence equipment this year, and German aid worth \u20ac4bn ($4.4bn) in 2025, vowing that \u201cwe will not let up in our support for Ukraine\u201d.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A Russian court has ordered the arrest in absentia of a CNN journalist, Nick Paton Walsh, for reporting from Ukrainian-held territory in Russia\u2019s Kursk region</strong>. Moscow has launched several criminal proceedings against western journalists who produced reports from the Kursk region after Kyiv\u2019s surprise August incursion, charging them with illegally crossing the border. The Leninsky court in the city of Kursk ordered Paton Walsh\u2019s arrest, demanding his extradition to Russia.

Ukraine\u2019s human rights ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, confirmed her death on Thursday in what he condemned as illegal detention. Andriy Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence, told the public broadcaster Suspilne that Roshchyna had been on a list of prisoners to be exchanged and that \u201ceverything necessary had been done\u201d for the swap. The Ukrainian prosecutor general\u2019s office said it had updated its war crime investigation into her disappearance to include murder.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A woman who worked for a Russian tank factory has been convicted of treason and sentenced to 12-and-a-half years in a penal colony</strong> <strong>for selling military information to Ukraine</strong>. Video published by the Sverdlovsk regional court in the Urals region showed a judge on Friday passing sentence on Viktoria Mukhametova, who displayed no emotion.

      "bodyText": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy has asked Pope Francis during a meeting at the Vatican for help in securing the release of Ukrainians held captive by Russia. The Ukrainian president, on a whirlwind tour of European capitals to discuss his proposed \u201cvictory plan\u201d for the war with Russia, said he had also invited the Vatican to take part in a conference on the prisoners of war, due to be held in Canada later this month. \u201cWe are counting on the Holy See\u2019s assistance in helping to bring back Ukrainians who have been taken captive by Russia,\u201d Zelenskyy said on social media, adding this was the main topic of his talks with the pope on Friday. A Vatican readout provided no details about the pope\u2019s talks with Zelenskyy but said a subsequent meeting between the Ukrainian leader and the Vatican\u2019s chief diplomat had included discussions \u201cdedicated to the state of the war \u2026 as well as the ways in which it could be brought to an end\u201d. Zelenskyy voiced hope that the war with Russia would end next year, speaking in Berlin during a visit to ask for sustained military support. Talking to the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, the Ukrainian leader thanked Germany for its backing and said it was \u201cvery important for us that this assistance does not decrease next year\u201d. He said he would present Scholz with his plan for winning the war, voicing hope that the conflict would end \u201cno later than next year, 2025\u201d. Scholz pledged Germany and European Union partners would send more defence equipment this year, and German aid worth \u20ac4bn ($4.4bn) in 2025, vowing that \u201cwe will not let up in our support for Ukraine\u201d. A Russian court has ordered the arrest in absentia of a CNN journalist, Nick Paton Walsh, for reporting from Ukrainian-held territory in Russia\u2019s Kursk region. Moscow has launched several criminal proceedings against western journalists who produced reports from the Kursk region after Kyiv\u2019s surprise August incursion, charging them with illegally crossing the border. The Leninsky court in the city of Kursk ordered Paton Walsh\u2019s arrest, demanding his extradition to Russia. The British journalist has previously reported for Channel 4 News and for the Guardian in Moscow. Ukrainian forces hit a fuel depot in the Russian-occupied Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine on Saturday, causing a fire, Ukraine\u2019s military said. \u201cThis facility was used to store oil and oil products, which were supplied, among other things, for the needs of the Russian army,\u201d the Ukrainian general staff said on Telegram. \u201cA fire was detected on the territory of the facility.\u201d Russia said on Friday its forces had captured the frontline villages of Zhelanne Druge and Ostrivske in eastern Ukraine, the latest in a string of territorial gains for Moscow. Ostrivske lies on the eastern banks of the Kurakhove reservoir in an area where Russia is concentrating its offensive activity, according to the Ukrainian military. The Russian defence ministry said last week that it had captured Zhelanne Druge and it was not immediately clear why it repeated that claim. Ukraine said it was investigating the death in Russian captivity of a Ukrainian journalist whose first-hand reports provided a glimpse into life under Russian occupation early in Moscow\u2019s invasion. Viktoria Roshchyna, 27, disappeared in August 2023 after embarking on a reporting trip to occupied eastern Ukraine and Russia acknowledged in April that she was being held. Ukraine\u2019s human rights ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, confirmed her death on Thursday in what he condemned as illegal detention. Andriy Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence, told the public broadcaster Suspilne that Roshchyna had been on a list of prisoners to be exchanged and that \u201ceverything necessary had been done\u201d for the swap. The Ukrainian prosecutor general\u2019s office said it had updated its war crime investigation into her disappearance to include murder. A woman who worked for a Russian tank factory has been convicted of treason and sentenced to 12-and-a-half years in a penal colony for selling military information to Ukraine. Video published by the Sverdlovsk regional court in the Urals region showed a judge on Friday passing sentence on Viktoria Mukhametova, who displayed no emotion. Her husband, Danil Mukhametov, is being tried separately on similar charges. Russian media said the couple both worked at Uralvagonzavod, a major tank producer. Russia sentenced two men in a region near Moscow to 16 years each for setting railways on fire allegedly on the orders of Ukrainian security services. The Ria Novosti news agency reported that the two \u201cyoung people\u201d \u2013 giving only their surnames, Zavalnov and Golodyuk \u2013 in the Kaluga region south of Moscow were found guilty of \u201cterrorism\u201d and sentenced in a military court for setting fire to operating equipment on the side of railway tracks. Finnish officials said police suspected a Russian citizen of committing war crimes in Ukraine in 2014 and he was expected to face charges before the end of the month. Vojislav Torden \u2013 a commander of the Russian far-right, neo-Nazi paramilitary Rusich group \u2013 was detained at Helsinki airport in July 2023. Finland\u2019s national bureau of investigation said on Friday it had completed a investigation into several offences dating back to 2014 and suspected Torden of several war crimes, including an \u201caggravated war crime\u201d.",

At least 16 people have been killed by the storm, according to the Tampa Bay Times, and recovery efforts continue, meaning the numbers could rise. Millions of people in central Florida were still reeling on Friday even though the worst fears about this monster storm were not realized and it entered and exited the state much faster than initially expected. The hurricane made landfall less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene hit north-west Florida and stayed over land as a tropical storm, with an unexpectedly high death toll of 230 people, the highest since Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005, and brought damage from flooding and high winds to 10 states. Milton\u2019s powerful and destructive weather system, which produced dozens of tornadoes in Florida on Wednesday, wrecked an estimated 150 homes, knocked out power to more than 3.3 million people, swept over barrier islands with 6ft of storm surge, ripped the roof off a baseball stadium and toppled a 500ft construction crane. About 2 million residents were still without power on Friday afternoon. A 14-year-old boy was rescued after being found floating on a piece of fence and a coast guard helicopter crew rescued a man floating on an ice chest separated from his boat in the Gulf of Mexico \u2013 \u201ca nightmare scenario for even the most experienced mariner\u201d, according to rescuers.
